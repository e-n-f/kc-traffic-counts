CASE NOS.:                        CMDV13-194; TPM10164; ER12-0007
PROJECT LOCATION:                 3001-3039 Broadway, Oakland, California; northwest corner of Broadway and
                                  30th Street. APNs 009-0705-004-00; 009-0705-005-00; 009-0705-006-00; and 009-

SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT: The Project involves the development of a new, one-story development with
36,000 square feet of high volume retail space and associated parking. Specifically, the proposed development
would include a 26,000 square-foot retail anchor tenant, Sprouts Farmers Market, and an additional 10,000
square­feet currently planned to accommodate three retail tenant spaces. All retail areas would be oriented along
Broadway and would be primarily accessed through a public plaza connected to the sidewalk along Broadway.
Public-realm amenities proposed include landscaping, a public gathering area with café style seating for
customers, as well as a plaza and garden seating for customers on the rooftop level. A total of 162 parking spaces
would be provided on the ground level (18 spaces behind the retail tenant spaces), and on a rooftop parking deck
accessed from an internal ramp (144 spaces). All vehicular access to the project site would be from a driveway on
30th Street, and service vehicles/trucks would exit the site and internal loading dock area via a driveway on
Broadway. The project site is not listed on the Cortese List of hazardous materials sites.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW: A Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) has been prepared for the
Project under the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant Public Resources
Code Section 21000 et. seq. The DEIR analyzes potentially significant environmental impacts in the following
environmental categories: Aesthetics; Agricultural and Forestry Resources; Air Quality; Biological Resources;
Cultural Resources; Geology, Soils and Geohazards; Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change; Hazards and
Hazardous Materials; Hydrology and Water Quality; Land Use, Plans and Policies; Mineral Resources; Noise;
Population, Housing and Employment; Public Services; Recreation; Transportation, Circulation and Parking; and
Utilities and Service Systems. The DEIR identifies a significant unavoidable environmental impact related to
Transportation, Circulation and Parking. Copies of the DEIR are available for review or distribution to interested
parties at no charge at the Department of Planning and Building, Planning and Zoning Division, 250 Frank H.
Ogawa Plaza, 2nd Floor Zoning Counter, Oakland, CA, 94612, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction

1.1 Project Overview
The City of Oakland ("City") as the Lead Agency prepared this Environmental Impact Report
("EIR") to address the physical and environmental effects of the Shops at Broadway Project
(Project). The Project would develop a 1.9-acre lot at the northeast corner of Broadway and 30th
Street in Oakland with a new, one-story development with 36,000 square feet of high volume
retail space and associated parking that would occupy the majority of the project site. Specifically,
the Project would include a 26,000 square-foot retail anchor tenant, Sprouts Farmers Market
(Sprouts), and a separate 10,000 square-foot commercial building currently planned to accommodate
three retail tenant spaces. Chapter 3, Project Description, of this document presents a detailed
description of the Project.


1.2 Environmental Review
The City of Oakland is the Lead Agency for this EIR (pursuant to State and local guidelines for
implementing the California Environmental Quality Act [CEQA]), and has determined that the
Shops at Broadway Project is subject to CEQA (Public Resources Code Section 21000, et seq.)
and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Chapter 3, Section
15000, et seq.) promulgated thereunder (together "CEQA").

The City elected not to prepare an Initial Study Checklist to reduce the scope of the EIR, as
permitted by Section 15060(d) of the CEQA Guidelines. This EIR addresses all environmental
topics identified in the City of Oakland's CEQA Thresholds/Criteria of Significance document. 
The analysis in this EIR relies on previously adopted environmental impact reports (EIRs) such as
the Land Use and Transportation Element (LUTE) EIR (City of Oakland, 1998), the Safety
Element Initial Study/Negative Declaration (City of Oakland, 2004), and is further informed by
certain analyses in the certified Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, Summit Campus Seismic
Upgrade and Master Plan Project EIR and the Proposed Amendments to the
Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan Project Draft EIR.

CEQA requires the analysis of potential adverse effects of a project on the environment. Potential
effects of the environment on a project are legally not required to be analyzed or mitigated under
CEQA. However, this EIR nevertheless analyzes potential effects of "the environment on the
project" in order to provide information to the public and decision-makers. Where a potential
significant effect of the environment on the project is identified, the document, as appropriate,

1. Introduction




identifies City Standard Conditions of Approval and/or project-specific non-CEQA
recommendations to address these issues.

Use of this EIR
Pursuant to CEQA, this EIR is a public information document prepared for use by governmental
agencies and the public to identify and evaluate potential environmental consequences of the
development of the Project, to evaluate and recommend mitigation measures that would substantially
lessen or eliminate significant environmental adverse impacts, and to examine a reasonable range of
feasible alternatives to the Project. This EIR is intended to provide the information and objective
environmental analysis necessary to assist the Lead Agency, the City of Oakland, in considering all
the approvals and actions necessary to approve the Project. It is prepared to aid and streamline the
review and decision-making process by disclosing the potential for significant environmental
impacts to occur with implementation of the Project. The information contained in this Draft EIR is
subject to review and consideration by the City of Oakland and any other responsible agency prior
to the City's decision to approve, reject or modify the Project.

EIR Scoping
On July 27, 2012, the City of Oakland issued a Notice of Preparation (NOP), to inform agencies
and interested parties of its intent to prepare and distribute a "Draft EIR for the Shops at Broadway
Development Project." The NOP was distributed to governmental agencies, organizations, and
persons interested in the Project. The City sent the NOP to agencies with statutory responsibilities
in connection with the Project and requested their input on the scope and content of the environmental
information that should be addressed in the EIR. The City of Oakland Planning Commission held
a public hearing on August 29, 2012, to accept comments regarding the scope of the EIR in response
to the NOP. The NOP review period ended on August 31, 2012. The NOP and written and oral
comments that the City received in response to the NOP are included as Appendix A to this Draft
EIR, which addresses all comments received in response to the NOP that are relevant to
environmental issues. During the public scoping process for this EIR, no specific areas of controversy
arose that are relevant to this CEQA analysis.

Public Review
This Draft EIR is available for public review and comment for the period identified on the Notice
of Release/Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Report accompanying this document
(45 calendar days, Friday August 16 through Monday, September 30, 2013). During the public
review and comment period, written comments on the Draft EIR may be submitted to the City at
the address indicated on the notice. Oral comments may be stated at the public hearing on the
Draft EIR, which will be held as indicated on the above-referenced notice.

Following the public review and comment period for the Draft EIR, the City will prepare responses
that address all written and oral comments on the Draft EIR's environmental analyses and received
within the specified review period. The responses and any other revisions to the Draft EIR will be
prepared as a Responses to Comments document. The Draft EIR and its Appendices, together with

the Responses to Comments document will constitute a Final EIR (commonly referred to
collectively as "EIR") for the Shops at Broadway Project.


1.3 CEQA Review and Approval
Prior to approving the Project, the City of Oakland must ultimately certify that it has reviewed
and considered the information in the EIR and that the EIR has been completed in conformity
with the requirements of CEQA. This EIR must be certified and considered by the Lead Agency
before any final City decision can be made regarding Project. This EIR identified significant
effects that would result from the Shops at Broadway Project. Therefore, pursuant to CEQA
Guidelines Section 15091, one or more of the following findings would be required if the City
decides to approve the Project:

(1)      Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the project which avoid
         or substantially lessen the significant environmental effect as identified in the Final EIR.

(2)      Such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public
         agency and not the agency making the finding. Such changes have been adopted by such
         other agency or can and should be adopted by such agency.

(3)      Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations, including provision
         of employment opportunities for highly trained workers, make infeasible the mitigation
         measures or project alternatives identified in the Final EIR.

CHAPTER 2
Summary

2.1 Project Overview
Portfolio Development Partners LLC, the project sponsor, proposes to develop a new, one-story
development with 36,000 square feet of high volume retail space and associated parking. The new
development would occupy the majority of the project site, which is currently a paved 287-space
parking lot open to the public. The project applicant submitted a Basic Application for
Development Review to the City of Oakland describing the proposed actions.

This EIR addresses all environmental topics identified in the City of Oakland`s CEQA
Thresholds/Criteria of Significance document, including topics that were found to be less-
than-significant.

2.1.1 Site Location
The proposed Project site is a 1.9-acre (83,143 square-feet) lot at 3001-3039 Broadway, at the
northeast corner of Broadway and 30th Street in Oakland, California. The project site is also
located in the proposed Broadway Valdez Specific Plan (BVDSP) area, for which the City is
currently preparing a vision and planning framework for future growth and development in an
approximately 95.5-acre area along both sides of Broadway, between Grand Avenue and I-580.
The project site is located on the west side of Broadway, approximately 500 feet (approximately
four blocks) south of the I-580 overpass.

The General Plan land use designation on the project site is "Community Commercial." The Project
is consistent with the Oakland General Plan land use designation that applies to the project site. The
current Zoning classification on the site is "Community Commercial Zone 2" / "Overlay Broadway
District" (CC-2/D-BR).

2.1.2 Key Components of the Project
The proposed development would include a 26,000 square-foot retail anchor tenant, Sprouts
Farmers Market, and a separate 10,000 square­foot commercial building currently planned to
accommodate three retail tenant spaces. All retail areas would be oriented along Broadway and
would be primarily accessed through a public plaza connected to the sidewalk along Broadway.
Public-realm amenities proposed include landscaping, a public gathering area with café style
seating for customers, as well as a plaza and garden seating for customers on the rooftop level.

Draft Environmental Impact Report                                                          August 16, 2013
2. Summary




The Project would provide a total of 162 parking spaces on two parking levels. At ground level,
18 at-grade parking spaces would be provided internal to the building, behind the retail tenant
spaces. Rooftop parking includes 144 spaces above grade and will be accessed by two elevators
and stairways. A total of 30 short-term bicycle parking spaces (i.e., bicycle racks) would be
provided along the Project's Broadway frontage and plaza for customer use. Project employees
would use the seven long-term bicycle parking spaces provided near the driveway entrance to the
ground-floor parking level.

The grocery's loading dock and trash area would be located internal to the project site and service
egress would be onto Broadway, where service vehicles/trucks would be restricted to only turn
right to travel southbound on Broadway. Mechanical equipment serving the grocery store and
retail spaces would be located on the ground-floor parking level and situated on the roof level and
would be screened from public views from ground-level as well as from the rooftop parking deck.
The Project does not include a diesel generator.

The Project's landscaping would be concentrated around the perimeter of the site, and a landscaped
buffer 10- to 24-feet wide with biofiltration characteristics would be created along the western
boundary of the site, between the proposed development and the abutting residential healthcare
facility. New street trees would be planted along the street frontages (replacing approximately
nine existing right-of-way trees). Also, the Broadway sidewalk would be widened. New lighting
on and within the new development would serve functional and aesthetics purposes, and no
overhead lighting is proposed.

The project sponsor plans to initiate construction in early 2014, with a target for business to
commence in spring 2015. Site preparation and construction activities required for the Project
would occur for approximately 12 months.

2.1.3 Public Agency Approvals
This EIR is intended to cover all approvals necessary to implement the Project. These include but
are not limited to the following approvals for the proposed Project for which the project applicant
has applied or anticipates applying. Each is described in detail in Chapter 3, Project Description,
consistent with CEQA Guidelines.

Other Agencies
Portions of the Project may require review and approval by a number of other public and quasi-
public agencies with jurisdiction over specific aspects of the Project. It is anticipated that these
other agencies will rely upon this EIR in their review and decision-making processes. A list of
these other agencies and their jurisdictional permits and approvals include the following:

         San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB)
         Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)
         East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD)
         Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (ACFWCD)
         California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC)


2.2 Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures
2.2.1 Impacts
All impacts and mitigation measures identified in this EIR are summarized in Table 2-1, Summary
of Impacts, Standard Conditions of Approval, Mitigation Measures, and Residual Impacts, at the
end of this chapter. Table 2-1 includes all impact statements, standard conditions of approval,
recommendations, and the level of significance of the impact after recommended mitigation measures
are implemented.

The Project would result in the following significant and unavoidable impacts:

         Impact GHG-1: The Project would produce greenhouse gas emissions that exceed
         1,100 metric tons of CO2e per year and that would exceed 4.6 metric tons of CO2e per
         service population annually.

         As discussed in Section 4.6, Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change, in Chapter 4 of this EIR,
         the Project would exceed the quantitative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions significance
         thresholds and therefore would implement GHG Standard Condition of Approval (SCA) 1,
         Greenhouse Gas Reduction Plan. All feasible GHG reduction measures have been factored
         into or considered for the Project, and the purchase of carbon offsets by the project applicant
         is required to reduce the Project's incremental GHG emissions above 1,100 MT of CO2e
         per year (approximately 411 MT CO2e per year ) and meet the requirements of GHG SCA
         1. Because the ongoing feasibility of this measure to be implemented by the project applicant
         is cannot be certain in the future (due to the inability to foresee with certainty the future
         market for and cost of purchasing carbon credits over time), this impact is conservatively
         considered significant and unavoidable.

         Impact TRANS-3: The Shops at Broadway Project would increase the v/c ratio for a
         critical movement by 0.05 or more (Significant Threshold #5) during the weekday PM
         peak hour and increase the total intersection v/c ratio by 0.03 or more and increase
         the v/c ratio for a critical movement by 0.05 or more during the Saturday peak hour
         (Significant Threshold #5) at the 27th Street/24th Street/Bay Place/Harrison Street
         (#11) intersection, which would operate at LOS F under 2035 conditions.

2. Summary




2.2.2 Recommendations
Although not required by CEQA, certain Recommendations are included in the environmental
analysis that are not necessary to address or mitigate any environmental impacts of the Project,
but instead are recommended by City staff to address planning and design issues. These
recommendations will be considered by decision-makers during the course of Project review and
may be imposed as project-specific Conditions of Approval.


2.3 Alternatives
Chapter 5 presents a detailed analysis of a range of reasonable alternatives to the proposed
Project. The alternatives that are analyzed in detail in this Draft EIR are listed below, and
Alternative 4 (Fully Mitigated / Grocery Only) is identified as the CEQA-required
environmentally superior alternative.

         No Project (No Change to Existing Conditions): The Project would not be developed. All
         existing conditions would continue into the future.
         1A: Mixed Use 150 (Residential + Grocery + Local Retail): 150 multifamily units above a
         28,000 square-foot grocery store and 6,500 square feet of local-serving retail. (Plans of
         Alternative 1A accompany its detailed description in Section 5.4, below.)
         1B: Mixed Use 225 (Residential + Grocery + Local Retail): 225 multifamily units above a
         26,000 square-foot grocery store and 9,400 square feet of local-serving retail (Plans of
         Alternative 1B accompany its detailed description in Section 5.4, below.)
         2: Mixed Use 225/No Grocery (Residential + Local Retail): 225 multifamily units above
         20,000 square feet of local-serving retail.
         3: Office/Retail (Office + Local Retail): 100,000 square feet of office use above 10,000
         square feet of local-serving retail.
         4: Fully Mitigated/Grocery Only (Grocery): 20,000 square-foot grocery store.


2.4 Areas of Concern
Several topics were raised in written comments received in response to the Notice of Preparation
(NOP) of this EIR, which are included in Appendix A to this Draft EIR. As appropriate, all topics
raised are addressed in this Draft EIR. No issues raised are considered major areas of concern
pertaining to CEQA, however, numerous comments were submitted pertaining to the non-CEQA
consideration of the desire for a mixed use project at the project site to be in conformance with
the Draft BVDSP and other regional planning policies. Two mixed use alternatives (discussed
above) are analyzed in this document in response to public comment.

                                                         mitigation at this intersection may be
                                                         required by 2034. Investigation of the need
                                                         for this mitigation shall be studied at that
                                                         time and every three years thereafter until
                                                         2035 or until the mitigation measure is
                                                         implemented, whichever occurs first.
                                                           After implementation of this measure, the
                                                           intersection would continue to operate at LOS

                                                           However, the mitigation measure would
                                                           reduce the v/c ratio for the critical
                                                           movements and mitigate the impact. No
                                                           secondary impacts would result from

                                                preparing and implementing these plans.
                                                However, if the City adopts a transportation fee
                                                program prior to implementation of this
                                                mitigation measure, the Project Sponsor shall

                                                conditions indicates that mitigation at this
                                                intersection may be required by 2033.
                                                Investigation of the need for this mitigation
                                                shall be studied at that time and in 2035 or until
                                                the mitigation measure is implemented,

                                                After implementation of this measure, the
                                                intersection would continue to operate at LOS F
                                                during the weekday PM peak hour. However,
                                                the mitigation measure would reduce the v/c
                                                ratio for the intersection and critical movements
                                                and mitigate the impact. No secondary impacts
                                                would result from implementation of this
                                                measure.

                                                program prior to implementation of this
                                                mitigation measure, the Project Sponsor shall
                                                have the option to pay the applicable fee in lieu
                                                of implementing this mitigation measure and
                                                payment of the fee shall be considered the
                                                equivalent of implementing the mitigation
                                                measure, which would still result in significant
                                                unavoidable impacts. A straight line

                                                conditions indicates that mitigation at this
                                                intersection may be required by 2033.
                                                Investigation of the need for this mitigation
                                                shall be studied at that time and in 2035 or until
                                                the mitigation measure is implemented,
                                                whichever occurs first.
                                                After implementation of this measure, the
                                                intersection would continue to operate at LOS
                                                F during the weekday PM peak hour and
                                                improve to LOS D during the Saturday peak
                                                hour. Although the mitigation measure would
                                                reduce the total intersection v/c ratio during the
                                                weekday PM peak hour, it would not reduce
                                                the v/c ratio for critical movements to 0.05 or
                                                less. Therefore, the impact would remain
                                                significant and unavoidable.
                                                No other feasible mitigation measures are
                                                available that would mitigate the project
                                                impacts at the 27th Street/24th Street/Bay
                                                Place/Harrison Street intersection. Traffic
                                                operations at the intersection can be further
                                                improved by providing additional automobile
                                                travel lanes, such as a third lane on
                                                northbound or southbound Harrison Street, or a
                                                second through lane on eastbound 27th Street.
                                                However, these modifications cannot be
                                                accommodated within the existing automobile
                                                right-of-way and would require additional right-

                                                        impact is considered significant and

                                                        This mitigation measure would also reduce
                                                        pedestrian delays at the intersection and
                                                        improve pedestrian safety by realigning the
                                                        crosswalks at the intersection and reducing
                                                        pedestrian crossing distances. No other

 Transportation and Circulation (cont.)
 Impact TRANS-4 (cont.)                         between Existing and 2035 Plus Project
                                                conditions indicates that mitigation at this
                                                intersection may be required by 2034.
                                                Investigation of the need for this mitigation
                                                shall be studied at that time and in 2035 or until
                                                the mitigation measure is implemented,
                                                whichever occurs first.
                                                After implementation of this measure, the
                                                intersection would continue to operate at LOS F
                                                during the weekday PM peak hour. However,
                                                the mitigation measure would reduce the v/c
                                                ratio for the intersection and critical movements
                                                and mitigate the impact. No secondary impacts
                                                would result from implementation of this
                                                measure.

                                                Recommendation TRANS-5: Implement the
                                                following measures:
                                                 Provide the following at the signalized 30th
                                                 Street/Broadway intersection:

                                                     signals at the four crosswalks at the
                                                     intersection; however, if the existing
                                                     signal equipment cannot accommodate
                                                     new pedestrian signal heads, replace the

                                                regards to bicycle parking:
                                                 Ensure that short-term and long-term bicycle
                                                 parking spaces are consistent with City of
                                                 Oakland Bicycle Parking Rack Guidelines.
                                                 Ensure the short-term bicycle parking on
                                                 sidewalks do not block pedestrian circulation.
                                                 Ensure that some short-term bicycle parking
                                                 spaces can accommodate bicycles with
                                                 trailers.
                                                 Monitor the usage of long-term and short-
                                                 term bicycle parking spaces and if necessary
                                                 provide additional parking spaces.

                                                 commuter parking.
                                                 Encourage employees to park on the roof-
                                                 level furthest away from the elevators and in

CHAPTER 3
Project Description

3.1 Project Location and Site Characteristics
3.1.1 Project Location and Access
The proposed project site is a 1.9-acre (83,143 square-feet) lot at 3001-3039 Broadway, at the
northwest corner of Broadway and 30th Street in Oakland, California. The project site is located
approximately one mile north of Downtown Oakland and three miles east of the San Francisco
Bay, as shown in Figure 3-1, Project Location Map. As shown in Figure 3-1, the project site
situated along Broadway­ the major north-south arterial that runs the length from downtown to
the Berkeley Hills ­ and 30th Street, which is a key connector street that runs east-west between
Broadway and Telegraph Avenue. The subject site is located at the base of "Pill Hill" where the
15-acre Alta Bates Summit Medical Center (ABSMC) is located. Regional freeway access to the
project site is provided by Interstates 580 (I-580) and 980 (I-980).

The project site is also located in the proposed Broadway Valdez Specific Plan (BVDSP) area, for
which the City is currently preparing a vision and planning framework for future growth and
development in an approximately 95.5-acre area along both sides of Broadway, between Grand
Avenue and I-580. The project site is located on the west side of Broadway, approximately
500 feet (approximately four blocks) south of the I-580 overpass.

3.1.2 Existing Project Site Characteristics
Existing and Previous Uses
The project site is currently a 287-space parking lot open to the public. The lot is paved with
asphalt and striped to accommodate automobiles and light trucks. As indicated during the public
scoping period for this EIR in August 2012, the City's staff report indicated that the parking lot
was used by ABSMC, which in late 2012 completed and moved into its new parking structure at
Hawthorne Avenue and Elm Street. Light posts are located in the center area of the site and along
the 30th Street and Broadway boundaries. Also located on the site is a "Connell Used Cars" sign
mounted on two tall posts along the Broadway frontage. There is also a small concrete pad where
a small automobile sales building previously existed. Figure 3-2, Site Plan and Surrounding
Context, is an aerial photograph showing the project site and its surroundings. Keyed
photographs showing more of the surrounding context are provided in Figures 4.1-1through 4.1-5
in Section 4.1, Aesthetics, of this EIR.)

1. INTRODUCTION
This chapter discusses the study purpose, the organization of this report, and the methods used in the
transportation impact analysis.

STUDY PURPOSE
This study purpose is to evaluate the off-site transportation system impacts of the proposed City of Oakley
Downtown Specific Plan (June 2009), and assess site access, circulation, and parking. This report presents the
findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the transportation impact analysis conducted by Fehr & Peers for
the proposed project. The proposed project primarily consists of providing 300 new residential dwelling units and
360,000 square-feet of commercial space in Downtown Oakley. Downtown Oakley generally comprises the area
surrounding Main Street (State Route 4) between Vintage Parkway, the Contra Costa Canal, and the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad. As part of the project, the Main Street Bypass will also be constructed as a
four-lane arterial just north of the existing Downtown area between west of Vintage Parkway and Second Street.

REPORT ORGANIZATION
This report is divided into six chapters as described below:

    ·    Chapter 1 ­ Introduction discusses the purpose and organization of this report.

    ·    Chapter 2 ­ Setting describes the project area, including the surrounding roadway network, existing
         morning (AM) and evening (PM) peak hour traffic volumes, and intersection levels of service.

    ·    Chapter 3 ­ Cumulative No Project Conditions describes year 2030 conditions without the proposed
         project

    ·    Chapter 4 ­ Project Characteristics describes the proposed project and methods used to estimate its
         trip generation.

    ·    Chapter 5 ­Cumulative With Project Conditions describes 2030 conditions with the proposed project.

    ·    Chapter 6 ­ Access, Circulation, and Parking provides an assessment of project access, circulation,
         and parking.

STUDY LOCATIONS AND FORECAST SCENARIOS
Transportation system impacts of the project were evaluated at intersections, as intersections are the locations on
the roadway system where congestion occurs. The study intersections listed below were selected because a
preliminary project trip generation analysis indicated that they would most likely be impacted by the proposed
project. The location of each intersection is shown on Figure 1.

For this study, the following scenarios were evaluated:

    ·   Existing ­ Existing conditions based on existing traffic volumes obtained from counts and existing
        roadway geometries.

    ·   Cumulative No Project ­ Future (Year 2030) forecast conditions based on the City of Oakley General
        Plan buildout and planned roadway improvements. This scenario assumes that the land uses in the
        study area would remain same as existing and the Main Street Bypass would not be constructed.

    ·   Cumulative With Project ­ Future (Year 2030) forecast conditions with buildout of both the General Plan
        and the Downtown Plan. This scenario assumes that the Main Street Bypass would be constructed as a
        four-lane arterial.

ANALYSIS METHODS
Study intersection operations were evaluated using level of service calculations. The analysis method outlined in
Technical Procedures Update prepared by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA) (July 2006), known
as CCTALOS, was utilized. To augment this analysis, the Transportation Research Board's 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) method and Synchro software were also used.

Signalized Intersections

To measure and describe the operational status of a local roadway network, transportation engineers and
planners commonly use a grading system called level of service (LOS). LOS is a description of an intersection's
operation, ranging from LOS A, indicating free-flow traffic conditions with little or no delay experienced by
motorists, to LOS F, which describes congested conditions where traffic flows exceed design capacity, resulting in
long queues and delays.

At each signalized study intersection, traffic conditions were evaluated using the CCTALOS and HCM methods.
The CCTA planning-level analysis uses various intersection characteristics (i.e., traffic volumes, lane geometry,
and signal phasing) to estimate the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio of an intersection. HCM operations analysis
uses various intersection characteristics (i.e., traffic volumes, lane geometry, signal timing, and pedestrian
activity) to estimate the average delay (measured in seconds per vehicle) experienced by motorists traveling
through an intersection. Table 1 summarizes the relationship between the v/c ratio, delay, and LOS for signalized
intersections.

Unsignalized Intersections

For unsignalized (all-way stop-controlled and side-street stop-controlled) intersections, Chapter 17 of
the Transportation Research Board's 2000 HCM method was used. With this method, the LOS ranking is related
to the total average delay for each intersection movement, including those not controlled by a stop sign. Total
delay is defined as the amount of time required for a driver to stop at the back of the queue, move to the first-in-
queue position, and depart from the queue into the intersection. Table 2 summarizes the relationship between
delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections. Typically, the delay and LOS for the worst-movement from the
side-street is also reported for side-street stop-controlled intersections. Synchro software was used to calculate
HCM-based LOS for unsignalized intersections.

                                                                                                                  3

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
Based on the adopted policies of CCTA and the City of Oakley, a significant traffic impact would occur if the
addition of project-related traffic would cause:

    ·   Operations of a signalized study intersection to decline from an acceptable level to an unacceptable level
        (service level thresholds are defined in Table 3 for each study intersection); or,
    ·   Deterioration in already unacceptable operations at a signalized intersection by a change in V/C ratio of
        more than 0.01 or a change in average delay of more than 5 seconds; or,
    ·   Operations of an unsignalized study intersection to decline from an acceptable level to an unacceptable
        level (as defined in Table 3), and the need for installation of a traffic signal at an unsignalized intersection,
        based on the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) Peak Hour Signal Warrant (Warrant
        3); or,
    ·   Substantially increased hazards or congestion due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves) or
        incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment); or,
    ·   Inadequate emergency access; or,
    ·   Conflicts with adopted alternative transportation policies, plans, or programs.

2. SETTING
This chapter describes the transportation system in the project study area, including the surrounding roadway
network, as well as transit, pedestrian, and bicycle facilities in the vicinity of the project site.

STUDY AREA ROADWAYS
The major roadways serving the project site are described below.

Main Street (SR 4) is the major thoroughfare in the study area and is generally an east-west arterial extending
from an interchange with SR 160 on the west to Brentwood and Stockton on the southeast. West of the project
area, Main Street typically provides two travel lanes in each direction with a two-way center left-turn lane. Within
the project area, Main Street provides one lane in each direction. Main Street has an Average Daily Traffic (ADT)
volume of 26,000 vehicles west of O'Hara Avenue. 1

O'Hara Avenue is a north-south roadway in the study area, providing connections between Main Street in Oakley
and Brentwood. O'Hara Avenue is generally residential and provides one travel lane in each direction.

Empire Avenue is a major north-south roadway in the study area, providing connections between Main Street in
Oakley and Brentwood. Empire Avenue typically provides two-travel lanes in each direction.

Cypress Road is a two- to four-lane east-west arterial that begins at Empire Avenue and continues east of Main
Street (SR 4). Cypress Road is generally residential in the study area.

Vintage Parkway is a two-lane north-south residential collector west of Downtown Oakley.

BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES
Bicycle and pedestrian facilities can be classified into several general types, including:

       ·    Class I Paths ­ These multi-use facilities are located off-street and can serve bicyclists, pedestrians, and
            sometimes equestrians. Recreational trails can be considered Class I facilities. Class I paths are
            typically 8 to 10 feet wide excluding shoulders and are generally paved.

       ·    Class II Bicycle Lanes ­ These facilities provide a dedicated area for bicyclists within the paved street
            width through the use of striping and appropriate signage. These facilities are typically 4 to 6 feet wide.

       ·    Class III Bicycle Routes ­ These facilities are found along streets that do not provide sufficient width for
            dedicated bicycle lanes. The street is then designated as a bicycle route through the use of signage
            informing drivers to expect bicyclists.

       ·    Sidewalks ­ The exclusive realm of pedestrians, sidewalks provide pedestrian access and circulation.
            Sidewalks can vary in width from 5 to 20 feet; wider sidewalks are typically found in heavily urbanized and
            downtown areas.

Currently, limited bicycle and pedestrian facilities exist within the project study area. The nearest designated
bicycle facilities are provided on Vintage Parkway, and portions of Empire Avenue and West Cypress Road. The

City of Oakley General Plan (adopted in December 2002), City of Oakley Parks, Recreation and Trails Master
Plan (March 2003), and East County Bikeway Plan (November 2001) propose that several new bicycle facilities
be constructed in the future. Within the study area, Class II bicycle lanes are planned for Main Street, O'Hara
Avenue, and Rose Avenue. Also, a Class I multi-use trail is planned along the BNSF railroad tracks, which will be
a part of the regional trail network to be maintained by the East Bay Regional Park District.

Sidewalks and other pedestrian amenities are provided intermittently throughout the Plan Area. Typically, narrow
sidewalks are provided along the south side of Main Street and no sidewalks are provided along the north side.
Within the Downtown area, crosswalks on Main Street are provided at Vintage Parkway and O'Hara Avenue.
Limited pedestrian facilities and heavy truck traffic along Main Street contribute to the limited pedestrian activity in
Downtown Oakley.

TRANSIT SERVICE
Tri-Delta Transit currently operates four local bus routes and two express commuter routes in the project area, as
described below. 2

Route 300, the Pittsburg BART/Brentwood Park & Ride route, is a weekday express route connecting Brentwood
to the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART station via Oakley and Antioch. The bus travels along Main Street with the
closest stops to the project area located near the Main Street/Vintage Parkway and Main Street/Norcross Lane
intersections. The bus operates from 4:15 AM to approximately 10:00 PM on 15- to 30-minute headways.

Route 383, the Oakley/Antioch/Freedom High School route, connects Oakley and Antioch and provides service to
Freedom High School in Oakley. The nearest stop to the project area is at the Main Street/Vintage Parkway
intersection. This route is only in service on weekdays and provides both clockwise and counterclockwise routes.
The counterclockwise route runs at approximately one-hour headways between 5:30 AM and 6:00 PM. The
clockwise route runs twice during the AM peak hour period only.

Route 391, the BART/Pittsburg/Antioch/Oakley/Brentwood route, provides weekday service to most East County
cities. In the project area, stops are provided at the Main Street/O'Hara Avenue intersection. The route operates
from 4:00 AM to 1:15 AM on 30- to 60-minute headways.

Route 393, the Bay Point/BART/Pittsburg/Antioch/Oakley/Brentwood route, provides weekend service and mirrors
weekday Route 391, with additional service to Bay Point. The route operates from 5:20 AM to 1:30 AM on 60-
minute headways.

Delta Express, the express commuter bus operated by Tri-Delta Transit, has two routes with stops in Oakley.
One route connects Oakley with the Dublin/Pleasanton BART station, where passengers can connect with a free
shuttle to the Bishop Ranch Business Park. Passengers can board the bus at the Oakley Lucky's (located in the
shopping center on the southeast corner of the Empire Avenue/Main Street intersection) at 4:55 AM and 5:25 AM,
and can board for return service from the Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station at 4:34 PM and 5:49 PM. Another
route, which connects to Lawrence Livermore National Lab, departs from Oakley Lucky's at 5:23 AM and 6:18
AM, with return trips leaving from the East Gate at 4:14 PM and 5:14 PM.

EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
Existing traffic conditions at most of the study intersections were based on morning (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and
evening (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) peak period intersection turning movement counts conducted in November 2008.
The counts were conducted on clear days with area schools in normal session. The existing peak period traffic
counts are provided in Appendix A. For each intersection count period, a universal peak hour period of 7:30 AM
to 8:30 AM and 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM were used. Since intersection counts were collected at different dates, they
were also adjusted to present consistent baseline conditions. Figure 2 presents the existing intersection peak
hour turning movements, intersection lane configurations and traffic controls.

Intersection operations were evaluated for the weekday AM and PM peak hours at the eight existing study
intersections. Table 4 summarizes the analysis results using both CCTALOS and HCM. The detailed intersection
LOS calculation worksheets are presented in Appendix B.

      SSSC = Side-street stop-controlled intersection
      AWSC = All-way stop-controlled intersection
  2. Volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) determined for all signalized intersections using the CCTALOS method.
  3. Average intersection delay is calculated for all signalized and unsignalized intersections using the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual
     (HCM) methods. For side-street stop-controlled intersections, delay for worst approach (in seconds per vehicle) is presented.

As shown in Table 4, most study intersections operate at acceptable levels of service based on the CCTALOS
and HCM methods as compared to the LOS thresholds presented in Table 3 during both AM and PM peak hours.

Only the stop-controlled northbound approach of the Main Street/Norcross Lane intersection operates at
unacceptable LOS F during both AM and PM peak hours. This is because northbound traffic on Norcross Lane
must yield to the heavy eastbound and westbound traffic on Main Street. However, the number of vehicles
experiencing LOS F conditions at this intersection is small, as most vehicles exiting the neighborhoods south of
Main Street use the signalized Main Street/O'Hara Avenue intersection to turn left into westbound Main Street.
While the Main Street/Norcross Lane intersection currently operates at an unacceptable level of service, the
intersection does not have traffic volumes that satisfy MUTCD peak hour signal warrants.

The CCTALOS method can sometimes produce different results than the HCM method. The primary reason that
the methods produce different results is that the CCTALOS method analyzes each intersection independently as
an isolated intersection and calculates level of service based on the theoretical capacity of each movement at the
intersection. Level of service in the HCM method is based on the delay experienced by each vehicle. The HCM
method calculates delay based on physical characteristics of the intersection including signal timing and phasing
at the intersection.

3. CUMULATIVE NO PROJECT CONDITIONS
This chapter discusses Cumulative (year 2030) traffic conditions based on conditions under the buildout of the
City's General Plan, but without the proposed project. The roadway network and land uses within the Plan Area
are assumed to be same as Existing conditions for the Cumulative No Project conditions analysis.

CUMULATIVE ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
Significant roadway network changes are expected in the study area in the future. Major roadway improvements
planned for the near future and assumed to be completed for the Cumulative conditions analysis include:

·     Widening of segment 2 of the SR 4 Bypass to a four-lane freeway between Lone Tree Way and Balfour Road
      with full interchanges at Sand Creek Road and Balfour Road

·     Widening of SR 4 freeway to provide three mixed-flow lanes and one high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in
      each direction west of Hillcrest Avenue

·     Widening of Main Street to a six lane arterial between Big Break Road and SR 160

·     Widening of Laurel Road to a four-lane arterial between Empire Avenue and Main Street

Figure 3 shows the expected lane configurations and traffic controls under Cumulative conditions.

CUMULATIVE NO PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUME FORECASTS
Traffic volumes for Cumulative conditions include existing traffic counts and traffic from approved and planned
developments in the region. These conditions represent the likely traffic levels in the year 2030, when buildout of
the proposed Downtown Plan is expected. Considering the major changes in the regional roadway network and
the amount of regional growth expected by 2030, the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA) Decennial
Countywide Travel Demand Model was selected as the most appropriate tool to forecast Cumulative (2030) No
Project AM and PM peak hour intersection volumes. The CCTA model was executed for years 2005 and 2030
and the results were used to develop intersection turning movement volumes through the "Furnessing" technique
as described in CCTA's Technical Procedures (June 2006). "Furnessing" is an iterative process which develops
future turning movement volumes by applying the difference between the base model volumes and the existing
intersection counts to future model approach and departure volumes.

Year 2005 Travel Demand Model

The travel demand model as developed by CCTA provides forecasts for the years 2000, 2010, 2020 and 2030. A
year 2005 model was developed for this analysis to provide a better reflection of existing baseline conditions. The
major inputs into the travel demand model are roadway network and land use databases. The roadway network
for the 2005 scenario was based on the 2000 roadway network and modified to include roadway network
improvements within the City of Oakley and surrounding areas that have been implemented since year 2000. The
land use input for the 2005 scenario was developed by interpolating between the model land uses for years 2000
and 2010. The 2005 land use files were further refined to reflect specific development projects constructed
between 2000 and 2005.

A sub-area model validation exercise was conducted, in which the forecasted 2005 AM and PM peak hour
volumes produced by the model were compared with intersection counts collected in Oakley between 2004 and


                                                                                                                12

2006. The model input parameters were further adjusted to better validate the baseline 2005 model. Appendix C
shows the results of the validation test for the study area based on the model validation criteria developed by
CCTA. The 2005 PM peak hour model satisfies all the CCTA validation criteria, while the AM peak hour model
does not. In comparison to the existing intersection counts, the 2005 AM peak hour model underestimates
volumes by about 10 to 20 percent. The underestimation is across the study area and not in isolated areas. In
addition, the underestimation would likely continue to occur in the future year model scenarios. The model results
are not being used directly for analysis, but rather are "Furnessed." So, the underestimation in both the existing
baseline and future forecasts are accounted for in the "Furness" process.

Year 2030 Travel Demand Model

The year 2030 roadway network included in the Countywide Model was reviewed and updated to include the
Cumulative roadway improvements previously discussed. The year 2030 land use database in the Countywide
                                            3
model is based on ABAG Projections 2005. In order to include all of the future planned development expected in
Oakley, the land use database within the City of Oakley was modified to reflect the buildout of the City's General
Plan. However, consistent with recent studies for projects in Oakley, the amount of employment assumed for
northwest area of Oakley has been reduced from the maximum envisioned under the Genera Plan to represent
more realistic development intensities in that area. The reduction in employment results in 40 percent fewer jobs
in Northwest Oakley than the General Plan buildout scenario (11,400 compared to 18,900); however, it would
provide higher density employment in that area as compared to the ABAG Projections 2005 (11,400 compared to
9,980 jobs).

Furthermore, no additional development beyond Existing conditions is assumed in the Downtown Area under the
Cumulative No Project conditions. 4 The roadway network within the Downtown Area is also assumed to remain
same as Existing conditions. Thus, the proposed Main Street Bypass would not be constructed and Main Street
would continue as a two lane arterial.

Year 2030 intersection Volume Forecasts

The year 2005 and 2030 AM and PM peak hour forecasts were used to develop intersection turning movement
volumes by using the "Furnessing" technique. Intersection volumes were balanced to present consistent volumes
throughout the study area. Figure 3 presents the forecasted Cumulative (2030) No Project AM and PM peak hour
intersection volumes.

  The traffic volume forecasts used in this analysis were developed in early 2007 using the latest version of the CCTA Countywide Model at
the time based on ABAG Projections 2005. A more recent version of the CCTA Model based on ABAG Projections 2007 has been released
since then. This model was compared to the model based on ABAG Projections 2005 that was used for this analysis. Since traffic volume
forecasts based on the Projections 2005 model would result in more conservative results, the previous traffic volume forecasts developed for
this project are used for the analysis.

Due to general growth in the region, traffic volumes in the study area are generally higher than Existing
conditions. Since the Main Street Bypass would not be constructed under the Cumulative No Project scenario,
and Main Street would continue as a two lane arterial, similar to existing conditions, a portion of through traffic
that would potentially use Main Street would divert to SR 4 Bypass freeway, Laurel Road, West Cypress Road,
and other east-west arterials and collectors. Thus, despite the projected growth in the study area, through traffic
volumes along Main Street are forecast to increase by 10 to 30 percent only in comparison to existing conditions.
Traffic volumes along other arterials and collectors are projected to increase commensurate with the expected
growth in the area.

ANALYSIS OF CUMULATIVE NO PROJECT CONDITIONS
The Cumulative (year 2030) No Project conditions analysis was performed using the same methods as Existing
conditions. Table 5 summarizes the intersection LOS analysis of the Cumulative No Project conditions. Appendix
B contains the LOS calculation worksheets. In general, most study intersections operate with worse LOS under
the Cumulative conditions than existing conditions. Based on the analysis, the following intersections would
operate at unacceptable conditions under the Cumulative No Project conditions:

#1      The signalized Oakley Road/Empire Avenue intersection would operate at LOS F (v/c = 1.10 and delay >
        100 seconds) during the PM peak hours.

#2      The signalized Main Street/Empire Avenue intersection would operate at LOS E (delay = 61 seconds)
        during the PM peak hours based on the HCM method. However, the intersection would operate at
        acceptable LOS D based on the CCTALOS method. The CCTALOS does not accurately estimate the
        LOS at this intersection because it does not account for the close spacing between this intersection and
        the adjacent Oakley Road/Empire Avenue intersection.

#4      The stop-controlled northbound approach at the side-street stop-controlled Main Street/Norcross Lane
        intersection would operate at LOS F (delay > 70 seconds) during both AM and PM peak hours. However,
        the intersection volumes would not satisfy the MUTCD peak hour signal warrant.

#5      The signalized Main Street/O'Hara Avenue intersection would operate at LOS E (v/c = 0.94 and delay =
        76 seconds) during the PM peak hours.

#6      The stop-controlled northbound approach at the side-street stop-controlled Main Street/Rose Avenue
        intersection would operate at LOS F (delay > 70 seconds) during both AM and PM peak hours. However,
        the intersection volumes would not satisfy the MUTCD peak hour signal warrant.

#8      The all-way stop-controlled West Cypress Road/O'Hara Avenue intersection would operate at LOS F
        (delay > 70 seconds) during both AM and PM peak hours. Forecasted AM and PM peak hour intersection
        volumes would satisfy the MUTCD peak hour signal warrant.

4. PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS
This chapter describes the proposed project, including existing and proposed land uses, and presents the
assumptions and methods used to estimate project trip generation, distribution, and assignment. Since the
developments proposed in the City of Oakley Downtown Specific Plan are not confined to a specific location and
the proposed project includes the Main Street Bypass, which would change traffic patterns in the study area, the
CCTA Decennial Countywide Travel Demand Model was selected as the most appropriate tool to estimate the
proposed project's trip making characteristics and changes in areawide traffic patterns.

PLAN AREA
Figure 4 presents the proposed Plan Area boundary superimposed over the CCTA model traffic analysis zone
(TAZ) structure in the study area. As shown on the figure, the Plan Area and the TAZ boundaries are not
completely contiguous. Three TAZs are completely included in the Plan Area, and eight TAZs are partially
included in the Plan Area.

EXISTING LAND USES
Table 6 presents the existing 2005 land uses in the Plan Area. Land uses were developed by interpolation
between 2000 and 2010 land uses in the CCTA Model and further refined by checking against recent aerials and
applying our knowledge of the local area. For the TAZs partially in the Plan Area, Table 6 only shows the land
uses within the Plan Area. The CCTA model land use input for non-residential developments is the number of
jobs in different categories. As shown in Table 6, the Plan Area is estimated to currently contain about 80
residential units and about 950 jobs.

PROPOSED LAND USES
Table 7 presents the additional development expected within the Plan Area as a result of the proposed plan. This
is generally based on the information provided in the Specific Plan. However, the Specific Plan does not provide
detailed information regarding potential development in each parcel. The Specific Plan provides general
guidelines regarding development in the Plan Area. Thus, the information presented in Table 7 presents our
interpretation of the most likely land uses that would be implemented in the Plan Area based on the proposed
plan. The land use assumptions discussed below represent the most likely amount of development in the Plan
Area, and not the maximum amount allowed. Existing land uses that would either be replaced by new uses or
demolished as a result of the proposed Main Street Bypass are also accounted for. Our specific assumptions
regarding both non-residential and residential components of the proposed project are further discussed below.

Non-Residential Land Uses

Based on the Specific Plan, 360,000 square feet of new commercial space would be developed in the Downtown
Plan Area. The following specific developments are stated in the Specific Plan:

·     City Hall Site (TAZ 30213) ­ The 6.9 acre site is currently occupied by the City Hall. It is estimated that an
      additional 26,000 square-feet of office space and about 6,500 square-feet of commercial space would be
      provided at this site. The site would also provide a park which is not included here.

·     Centro Mart Frontage (TAZ 30203) ­ The site currently provides 21,000 square-feet of retail space. An
      additional 12,600 square-feet of retail would be provided at this site.

·     East Main Street (TAZ 30190 and 30272) ­ This four acre site fronting the north side of Main Street between
      Second Street and the Contra Costa Canal is currently occupied by a mix of industrial, retail, and other uses.
      Although the Specific Plan does not specify the types of developments in this site, it is assumed that the
      existing uses at the site would be replaced by about 62,000 square feet of retail space (assumed FAR of 0.3).

·     Oakley Plaza (TAZ 30203) ­ The site currently provides 20,000 square-feet of retail space. An additional
      35,000 square-feet of retail would be provided at this site.

·     Main Street Triangle Site (TAZ 30202) ­ This 1.4 acre site would be bound by the proposed Main Street
      Bypass, Main Street, and Vintage Parkway. Although the Specific Plan does not specify the types of
      developments in this site, it is assumed that the existing uses at the site would be replaced by about 18,000
      square feet of retail space (FAR of 0.3).

·     Vintage Parkway Site (TAZ 30202) ­ The currently vacant site west of Vintage Parkway would be developed

  The above sites combined would provide about 254,000 square-feet of new commercial space. Thus, under the
  Specific Plan, an additional 106,000 square feet of commercial space can be developed in the remainder of the
  Plan Area. As summarized in Table 7, the unassigned commercial developments were allocated to the remaining
  TAZs in the plan area proportional to their area and based on the allowed development guidelines. Since retail is
  the highest traffic generating use for these commercial areas, this analysis assumes that these unassigned
  commercial spaces would develop as retail.

  Since the CCTA model uses employment rather than size as land use input for non-residential uses, the land
  uses shown in Table 7 were converted to employment consistent with land use-to-job conversion ratios in Oakley
  General Plan. The proposed Specific Plan is estimated to result in about 665 new jobs in the Plan Area.

  Residential Land Uses

  Based on the Specific Plan, 300 new residential units would be developed in the Plan Area. Although the
  Specific Plan does not identify any specific residential developments, it provides guidelines on location and
  intensity of the potential residential developments. Residential density of up to 45 units per acre can be provided

                                                                                                                                            20

within the Downtown Core Area (approximately corresponding to the area fronting Main Street between Vintage
Parkway and Fourth Street). Residential density of 17 to 24 units per acre can be provided in the remaining parts
of the Plan Area.

Since most of the Plan Area zoned for single-family development is already built, it is assumed that the majority of
the new housing would be multi-family. The Specific Plan also allows mixed use development. Thus, the 300
new residential units were allocated to the TAZs proportionally to the TAZ area based on the guidelines in the
Specific Plan. The estimated number of new residential units in each TAZ is summarized in Table 7.

YEAR 2030 LAND USES
Table 8 presents the expected land uses in the Plan Area in year 2030. It consists of buildout of the Plan Area as
shown in Table 7 and converted to CCTA model land use categories, added to the existing land uses shown in
Table 6. After the completion of the Specific Plan in 2030, about 375 residential units and 1,600 jobs are
expected in the Plan Area. To determine the impacts of the proposed project, a Cumulative With Project
conditions model was executed and compared to a Cumulative No Project conditions model. The Cumulative
With Project conditions model includes the land uses summarized on Table 8 in the Plan Area, and the
Cumulative No Project conditions model assumes that land uses within the Plan Area would remain same as
Existing condition.

TRIP GENERATION COMPARISON
The CCTA Travel Demand Model estimates that the proposed Downtown Plan would generate about 483 net new
AM peak hour and 945 net new PM peak hour trips. The model estimated trip generation (which is based on
number of jobs for non-residential land uses) was compared to trip generation estimated using the trip generation
rates published by Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in Trip Generation (which is based on square-feet
for non-residential land uses). Table 9 compares the trip generation for the proposed Downtown Plan using the
CCTA model and ITE trip generation rates. The CCTA model only includes primary trips and does not account for
pass-by or diverted trips (i.e., trips already on the roadway system that make an interim stop at the site). Based
on data presented in ITE Trip Generation Handbook, about 40 percent of trips generated by retail developments
of similar size adjacent to roadways with similar volumes as Main Street are either pass-by or diverted trips. The
Trip generation estimated by ITE rates was reduced by 40 percent to provide trip generation comparable to the
CCTA model. Based on the ITE Trip Generation rates, the proposed project is estimated to generate 494 net new
AM peak hour and 957 net new PM peak hour trips.

As shown in Table 9, the CCTA model generates about two percent fewer trips than estimated by ITE Trip
Generation rates during both AM and PM peak hours. Since both ITE and the CCTA model result in similar trip
generation, the trip generation estimated by the CCTA model is considered valid.

PLAN AREA ROADWAY NETWORK
Based on the Downtown Plan, the following roadway network modifications are assumed as part of the proposed
project.

·     Construction of the Main Street Bypass as a four-lane arterial north of the existing Main Street between west
      of Vintage Parkway and O'Hara Avenue. The proposed Main Street Bypass would intersect existing Vintage
      Parkway. Norcross Lane would be extended north to intersect the new Main Street Bypass (See Figure 1).

·     The following three alternatives, as shown on Figure 5, are proposed for the eastern intersection of the Main
      Street Bypass with Main Street:

          o    Alternative 1 would extend O'Hara Avenue to the Main Street Bypass to create a new signalized
               intersection. The existing segment of Main Street between O'Hara Avenue and Second Street would
               also be eliminated.

          o    Alternative 2 would create a four-approach, two-lane roundabout with the Main Street Bypass
               comprising the northwestern and eastern approaches, Main Street comprising the southwestern
               approach, and O'Hara Avenue comprising the southern approach.

          o    Alternative 3 would create a four approach, signalized intersection with the Main Street Bypass, Main
               Street, and O'Hara Avenue.

·     The newly created intersections along the Main Street Bypass at Main Street (western end), Vintage
      Parkway, and Norcross Lane would be signalized.

·     The existing Main Street would remain a two-lane arterial and would be modified to be more pedestrian
      oriented. As a result, the existing Main Street/Vintage Parkway and Main Street/Norcross Lane intersections
                                                  5
      would be converted to all-way stop-control.

The Main Street Bypass is included in the Cumulative With Project conditions model runs to determine their
effects on areawide traffic patterns.




5
 The Downtown Specific Plan shows the Main Street/Vintage Parkway and Main Street/O'Hara Avenue intersections as remaining signalized.
However, it is recommended that these intersections be converted to all-way stop-controlled to maintain the proposed pedestrian orientation of
Main Street within the Downtown area. See Chapter 6 for more detail.

5. CUMULATIVE WITH PROJECT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
This chapter discusses Cumulative (year 2030) traffic conditions based on conditions under the buildout of the
City's General Plan, with the build-out of the proposed project. The roadway network and land uses within the
Plan Area are consistent with the proposed Downtown Plan as described in the previous chapter.

CUMULATIVE WITH PROJECT TRAFFIC FORECASTS
Similar to the Cumulative No Project conditions, the CCTA Decennial Countywide Travel Demand Model was
used to forecast Cumulative With Project AM and PM peak hour intersection volumes. The 2030 land uses were
modified to include the project land uses as shown in Table 8. In addition, the 2030 roadway network was
modified to include the roadway improvements described in the previous chapter. The CCTA model was
executed for years 2005 and 2030 and the results were used to develop intersection turning movement volumes
through the "Furnessing" technique.

The Cumulative With Project AM and PM peak hour intersection volumes are presented on Figure 5. In
comparison to the Cumulative No Project conditions volumes, the completion of the Main Street Bypass results in
an increase in through traffic along Main Street, and a decrease in traffic on other parallel roadways such as West
Cypress Road and Laurel Road. Additional traffic generated by the proposed Downtown Plan would also
contribute to the increase in traffic volumes in the study area. Since the current Main Street would be modified to
be more pedestrian friendly, it is expected that it would mostly serve local traffic with minimal through traffic.

CUMULATIVE WITH PROJECT CONDITIONS
Table 10 summarizes the intersection LOS analysis results of the Cumulative With Project conditions. Tables 11
and 12 summarize the LOS analysis for the three Main Street east end alignment alternatives using CCTALOS
and HCM methods. Appendix B contains the LOS calculation worksheets. Based on thresholds presented in
Table 3, the following study intersections would operate at unacceptable service levels under Cumulative With
Project conditions.

#1      The signalized Oakley Road/Empire Avenue intersection would operate at unacceptable LOS E during
        the PM peak hour (delay = 62 seconds based on HCM). The intersection would improve from LOS F
        (delay > 100 seconds) during the PM peak hour under Cumulative No Project conditions. Since the
        proposed project would reduce delay and improve traffic operations, the proposed project would not
        cause a significant impact at the Oakley Road/Empire Avenue intersection.

#2      The signalized Main Street/Empire Avenue intersection would operate at unacceptable LOS F during the
        PM peak hour (v/c = 1.01 based on CCTALOS and delay = 82 seconds based on HCM). The intersection
        would degrade from LOS E (delay = 61 seconds) under Cumulative No Project conditions.

#5      The proposed roundabout at the Main Street/Main Street Bypass/O'Hara Avenue intersection under
        Alternative 2 would operate at unacceptable LOS F during the PM peak hour (delay > 120 seconds)
        under Cumulative With Project conditions.

#6      The stop-controlled northbound approach at the side-street stop-controlled Main Street/Rose Avenue
        intersection would continue to operate at LOS F (delay > 70 seconds) during both AM and PM peak
        hours. Since the intersection volumes would not satisfy the MUTCD peak hour signal warrant, the
        proposed project would not cause a significant impact at the Main Street/Rose Avenue intersection.

#8     The all-way stop-controlled West Cypress Road/O'Hara Avenue intersection would continue to operate at
       unacceptable LOS F (delay > 70 seconds) during the PM peak hour. The intersection would satisfy the
       MUTCD peak hour signal warrant under the Cumulative With Project conditions.

The other study intersections would operate at LOS D or better during both AM and PM peak hours under
Cumulative with Project conditions.

INTERSECTION IMPACTS AND MITIGATIONS
Based on the application of the significance criteria presented in Chapter 1, three significant impacts were
identified. These impacts and mitigation are described below.

IMPACT 1:                         The addition of traffic generated by the proposed Downtown Plan would cause
                                  the signalized Main Street/Empire Avenue intersection (#2) to operate at
                                  unacceptable LOS F during the PM peak hour, causing a significant impact under
                                  Cumulative With Project conditions.

ANALYSIS:                         The intersection would operate at acceptable LOS D (v/c = 0.88) based on the
                                  CCTALOS method and at unacceptable LOS E (delay = 61 seconds) during the
                                  PM peak hour under Cumulative No Project conditions. Traffic generated by the
                                  projects developed within the Downtown area would cause the intersection to
                                  operate at an unacceptable LOS F (v/c = 1.01 and delay = 82 seconds) during
                                  the PM peak hour.

MITIGATION MEASURE 1:             Mitigation of the unacceptable conditions at Main Street/Empire Avenue
                                  intersection can be achieved by:

                                  ·   Adding a second exclusive left-turn lane on the westbound approach of the
                                      intersection;

                                  ·   Converting the exclusive southbound right-turn lane at the Oakley Road/
                                      Empire Avenue intersection to a shared through/right-turn lane; and

                                  ·   Coordinating signal phasing and timing at the Main Street/Empire Avenue
                                      and Oakley Road/Empire Avenue intersections.

                                  The widening of Main Street at Empire Avenue is included in the City's
                                  Transportation Impact Fee Program. The coordination of signals at Main Street/
                                  Empire Avenue and Oakley Road/Empire Avenue intersections is not included in
                                  any funding documents. Projects developed as part of the Downtown Plan shall
                                  contribute to this mitigation by paying their fair share of the cost through the
                                  payment of the City's Transportation Impact Fee, and any additional fees as
                                  determined by City of Oakley.

Considering the close spacing on Empire Avenue between Main Street and Oakley Road, signal timing and
phasing at the two intersections should be coordinated to minimize queue spillbacks at either intersection.
Currently southbound Empire Avenue at Oakley Road provides one exclusive right-turn lane and one through
lane. This configuration would not accommodate the proposed dual left-turn from westbound Main Street to
southbound Empire Avenue. The exclusive right-turn lane on southbound Empire Avenue at Oakley Road should
be converted to a shared through/right-turn lane to accommodate the additional traffic. Analysis using traffic



                                                                                                               31

simulation software indicates that with implementation of these improvements, both intersections would operate at
acceptable LOS and queues would not spill back from either intersection.

The Main Street/Empire Avenue intersection would operate at LOS D (v/c = 0.90) based on the CCTALOS
method and LOS D (delay = 50 seconds) based on the HCM method during the PM peak hour with
implementation of this mitigation measure. This impact would be reduced to a less-than-significant level with
the implementation of this mitigation measure.

IMPACT 2:                                The addition of traffic generated by the proposed Downtown Plan at West
                                         Cypress Road/O'Hara Avenue (#8) intersection would contribute to the
                                         unacceptable LOS F conditions during the PM peak hour, causing a significant
                                         impact under Cumulative With Project conditions.

ANALYSIS:                                The all-way stop-controlled intersection would operate at unacceptable LOS F
                                         (delay > 70 seconds) during the PM peak hour regardless of the proposed
                                         Downtown Plan. Traffic generated by the projects developed within the
                                         Downtown area would contribute to the unacceptable conditions by adding traffic
                                         to the intersection.

MITIGATION MEASURE 2                     Mitigation of the unacceptable conditions at West Cypress Road/O'Hara Avenue
                                         intersection can be achieved through the installation of traffic signals at the
                                         intersection. The forecasted AM peak hour and PM peak hour intersection
                                                                                                               6
                                         volumes would satisfy the MUTCD peak hour traffic signal warrants. This signal
                                         installation is included in the City's Transportation Impact Fee Program. Projects
                                         developed as part of the Downtown Plan would contribute to this mitigation by
                                         paying their fair share of the cost through the payment of the City's
                                         Transportation Impact Fee.

The West Cypress Road/O'Hara Avenue intersection would operate at LOS B (v/c = 0.67) based on the
CCTALOS method and LOS C (delay = 31 seconds) based on the HCM method during the PM peak hour with
implementation of this mitigation measure. This impact would be reduced to a less-than-significant level with
the implementation of this mitigation measure.

IMPACT 3:                                The proposed roundabout at the Main Street/Main Street Bypass/O'Hara Avenue
                                         intersection under Alternative 2 would operate at unacceptable LOS F conditions
                                         during the PM peak hour under Cumulative With Project conditions.

ANALYSIS:                                The roundabout intersection would operate at unacceptable LOS F (delay > 120
                                         seconds) during the PM peak hour. The relatively high traffic volumes along
                                         Main Street Bypass would provide few gaps for vehicles on the O'Hara Avenue
                                         and Main Street approaches of the intersection to turn into Main Street Bypass.

  This analysis is intended to examine the general correlation between the planned level of future development and the need to install new
traffic signals. It estimates future development-generated traffic compared against a sub-set of the standard traffic signal warrants
recommended in the Federal Highway Administration Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and associated State guidelines. This
analysis should not serve as the only basis for deciding whether and when to install a signal. To reach such a decision, the full set of warrants
should be investigated based on field-measured, rather than forecast, traffic data and a thorough study of traffic and roadway conditions by an
experienced engineer. Furthermore, the decision to install a signal should not be based solely upon the warrants, since the installation of
signals can lead to certain types of collisions. The City of Oakley should undertake regular monitoring of actual traffic conditions and accident
data, and timely re-evaluation of the full set of warrants in order to prioritize and program intersections for signalization.



                                                                                                                                             32

                                             Traffic generated by the projects developed within the Downtown area would also
                                             contribute to the unacceptable conditions by adding traffic to the intersection.

MITIGATION MEASURE 3                         Mitigation of unacceptable conditions at the Main Street/Main Street Bypass/
                                             O'Hara Avenue intersection can be achieved by selecting either Alternative 1 or
                                             Alternative 3. if Alternative 2 is selected, the impact would remain significant
                                             and unavoidable.

CUMULATIVE WITH PROJECT MITIGATED CONDITIONS
The study intersections would operate at acceptable conditions with the implementation of the recommended
mitigation measures outlined in the previous section, with the exception of the Main Street Bypass/Main
Street/O'Hara Avenue intersection under Alternative 2. Table 13 summarizes the intersection LOS at the study
intersection after the implementation of the recommended improvements.

 City of Oakley Downtown Specific Plan ­ Transportation Impact Analysis
 August 2009




6. ACCESS, CIRCULATION, AND PARKING
This chapter evaluates access and circulation for vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles, transit, and emergency vehicles,
and parking with the proposed Downtown Plan. The proposed Plan does not include detailed information about
the projects that would be developed as part of the Downtown Plan and the proposed Main Street Bypass is still
in preliminary planning stages. Therefore, this evaluation is provided at a general level and is based on the
design and development guidelines provided in the City of Oakley Downtown Specific Plan, dated June 2009.

ACCESS AND CIRCULATION
Access and circulation for vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles, transit, emergency vehicles, and trucks is discussed in
this section. The Circulation Element of the City of Oakley General Plan and the Oakley Long Range Roadway
Plan (LRRP) provide general roadway design guidelines, but not rigid design standards. The proposed
transportation circulation system in the Downtown Plan is generally consistent with these guidelines. The
recommended design features described in the Downtown Plan that are not consistent with these guidelines are
also discussed in this section.

Vehicles

As shown on Figure 1, Main Street is a major arterial in the Downtown area and provides vehicular access and
circulation through the Downtown area. The Main Street Bypass would be constructed just north of the
Downtown core area, providing additional roadway capacity for through traffic and lessening traffic congestion on
Main Street. Other side streets provide access to and from uses within the Downtown area. Planned roadway
improvements for components of the vehicular circulation system in the Downtown area are discussed below.

Main Street Bypass

The Downtown Plan proposes the construction of the Main Street Bypass to divert the heavy through and truck
traffic away from Main Street in the Downtown area providing for more efficient through traffic circulation on Main
Street Bypass and creating a pedestrian friendly environment on Main Street. The proposed Main Street Bypass
would be constructed north of Main Street as a four lane arterial with a center median/left-turn lane, no parking
lanes, and landscaping, and sidewalks on both sides of the roadway. The Main Street Bypass would intersect
Main Street about midway between Gardenia Street and Vintage Parkway in the west. Three roadway
alternatives, as shown on Figure 5, are proposed for the east end of Plan Area. Norcross Lane would also be
extended further north to intersect Main Street Bypass. Based on preliminary design, the intersections of Main
Street Bypass at west end of Main Street, Vintage Parkway, Norcross Lane, and east end of Main Street
depending on the alternative would be signalized. Adjacent commercial developments would have direct
vehicular access on Main Street Bypass. The number of these driveways should be minimized and they should
be limited to right-in/right-out movements only.

Main Street within the Downtown Core

Since the Main Street Bypass is projected to provide adequate capacity to serve the forecasted through-traffic
demand, the existing Main Street can be redesigned to create a pedestrian-scale street. The Downtown Plan
recommends interim improvements on Main Street prior to the completion of the Main Street Bypass, and ultimate
improvements after the completion of the Main Street Bypass. Currently, Main Street does not have a uniform
roadway width in the Downtown area; the roadway has intermittent curbs, gutters and sidewalks of various widths,
and a combination of parallel or head-in parking in various sections.


                                                                                                                34
 City of Oakley Downtown Specific Plan ­ Transportation Impact Analysis
 August 2009




In the interim condition, Main Street would be redesigned to provide a uniform cross-section while continuing to
accommodate through traffic, including heavy trucks. Thus, to the extent feasible, curbs, gutters and 12-foot
sidewalks will be constructed without interfering with through traffic on Main Street. Main Street would provide a
consistent curb-to-curb width of 62 feet to accommodate one 15-foot travel lane and an eight-foot parking lane in
each direction, with a 16-foot turn-lane/center median. This cross-section cannot be implemented on certain
sections of Main Street because of existing buildings. These sections would retain the current cross-section until
the completion of the Main Street Bypass. The Downtown Plan also recommends construction of corner bulb-
outs at all intersections in the Downtown area. The corner bulb-out and other design features may interfere with
through truck circulation. Thus, the interim design of Main Street should be reviewed to ensure that the roadway
would provide adequate truck circulation through Downtown.

In the ultimate conditions, Main Street would continue to provide a 62-foot curb-to-curb width. Travel lanes would
be narrowed to 14 feet and the center median would be widened to 18 feet to provide additional landscaping.
Main Street would accommodate corner bulb-outs at all intersection corners within the Downtown core.

Since the Main Street Bypass would provide adequate capacity for through traffic in the corridor, the existing Main
Street would only need to accommodate traffic generated by the Downtown area and adjacent neighborhoods.
Based on preliminary analysis summarized in the previous chapter, the existing signals at Main Street/Vintage
Parkway and Main Street/O'Hara Avenue intersections would no longer be needed. Thus, it is recommended that
both intersections be converted to all-way stop-controlled intersections after the completion of the Main Street
Bypass.

Main Street East

Main Street East consists of the section of Main Street just east of the Main Street Bypass. This section of Main
Street currently provides one travel lane in each direction but would need to be widened to provide two travel
lanes in each direction to accommodate forecasted through traffic, including trucks. The Downtown Plan provides
for widening Main Street to provide a curb-to-curb width of 62 feet to accommodate two 11-foot travel lanes in
each direction, with a 10-foot center median/left turn lane, and an eight foot parking lane on south side of the
roadway. The LRRP identifies this section of Main Street as a four-lane commercial arterial, and recommends an
88-foot curb-to-curb width that accommodates parking and bicycle lanes on both sides of the street. This
recommended width cannot be provided because the south frontage of the roadway has already been built and
further widening of the roadway would preclude future development on the north side of the roadway. Since Main
Street would continue to serve as a major truck route and is identified as a future bicycle facility, it is
recommended that the proposed parking lane be eliminated to provide wider outer lanes in both directions to
better accommodate trucks and bicycles.

Downtown Side Streets

The side-streets within the Downtown area, including Norcross Lane, Hall Street, Second Street, Third Street, and
Acme Street, provide local access and circulation to the uses in the Downtown area. The Downtown Plan
recommends various streetscape improvements on these roadways. Generally, these side streets would provide
one travel lane in each direction, with either parallel or angled parking with improvements such as sidewalks,
crosswalks, and corner bulb-outs to enhance the pedestrian circulation.

Pedestrian

The proposed Downtown Plan would create a pedestrian friendly downtown environment by enhancing pedestrian
access and circulation. Specific design elements of the Downtown Plan include widening existing sidewalks, and
providing new sidewalks, crosswalks, and median refuges; constructing corner bulb-outs to shorten walking
distance across intersections; minimizing driveway curb-cuts to reduce vehicle/pedestrian conflicts; and providing

                                                                                                                35
 City of Oakley Downtown Specific Plan ­ Transportation Impact Analysis

additional pedestrian amenities such as landscaping, pedestrian-scale lighting, and fronting commercial
developments.

Bicycle Circulation

As stated in Chapter 2, bicycle facilities are planned for O'Hara Avenue and Main Street. Based on design
guidelines presented in the Downtown Plan, Class II (signed and striped bicycle lanes) can be accommodated on
Main Street Bypass and O'Hara Avenue, and Class III (signed bicycle routes) can be accommodated on Main
Street within the Downtown core area, but bicycle facilities can not be accommodated on Main Street, east of the
Main Street Bypass. However, the previous recommendation to eliminate on-street parking on the south side of
Main Street to accommodate wider travel lanes would allow Class III facilities on this portion of Main Street.

Transit Access

Tri-Delta Transit operates several bus routes on Main Street, Vintage Parkway, and O'Hara Avenue through the
Downtown area. Currently, minimal transit amenities, such as bus pullouts or shelters are provided, and
pedestrian access to transit can be difficult due to lack of adequate sidewalks. The design for the new Main
Street Bypass and planned improvements on Main Street should be coordinated with Tri-Delta Transit to
determine the appropriate location for bus pullouts and appropriate bus amenities such as shelters on Main
Street. Pedestrian facilities connecting the transit stops and major destinations should be provided. The
proposed project would improve pedestrian access to transit by providing new sidewalks and enhancing existing
sidewalks.

Emergency Access

Factors such as number of access points, roadway width, and proximity to fire stations determine if a site provides
sufficient emergency access. Multiple roadways provide access to and from the Downtown area. If one of these
roadways is blocked or obstructed, an emergency vehicle could use an alternate route to access the area. As
part of the Downtown Plan, the vehicle travel widths on many roadways within the Downtown area may be
narrowed to provide sidewalks, on-street parking, medians, or corner bulb-outs. Improvement plans for each
roadway should be reviewed to ensure that adequate width and turning radius is maintained on all roadways.
Also, site plans for individual developments should be reviewed to ensure adequate emergency access. The
project site is located in the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District and the nearest fire station is located on
Second Street, just south of the Plan Area. The proximity of the fire station would allow for timely emergency
response to the project site. Given these considerations, the project would provide sufficient emergency access.

Truck Access and Circulation

The City of Oakley General Plan identifies Main Street as a truck route. Although the number of heavy trucks on
Main Street in expected to decrease in the near future after the completion of the SR 4 Bypass freeway, Main
Street would continue to function as a major truck route providing truck access for the City of Oakley and adjacent
communities. The proposed interim design for Main Street within the Downtown core area prior to completion of
the Main Street Bypass would continue to accommodate trucks. Through truck traffic on this portion of Main
Street would be prohibited after the completion of the Main Street Bypass, as Main Street Bypass would
accommodate all through truck traffic. As previously mentioned, it is recommended that the outside lanes on
Main Street, east of the Main Street Bypass, be widened to better accommodate trucks.

Since the new developments in the proposed Downtown Plan would primarily consist of smaller commercial
projects, most deliveries are expected in smaller delivery vehicles. Deliveries in larger semi-trucks are expected
to be minimal. To the extent possible, large semi-truck deliveries should be scheduled for off-peak periods to

                                                                                                                 36
 City of Oakley Downtown Specific Plan ­ Transportation Impact Analysis
 August 2009




minimize conflicts between delivery trucks and passenger vehicles. The site plan for specific development
projects within the Downtown Plan area should be reviewed to ensure adequate truck access at project driveways
and circulation within the project sites.

PARKING
Public parking within the downtown area is limited to roughly 100 unmarked, curbside spaces along the
neighborhood streets south of Main Street (SR 4). While the supply of parking, both public and private off-street,
is adequate for the current level of development, the plan recommends a significant increase in the amount public
parking to provide for and encourage new development. The Plan establishes a Downtown Parking District,
whose boundaries mirror those of the Downtown Core Area and includes the following potential new public
parking facilities:

    ·   350 stalls north of Main Street in public parking lots and on-street parking

    ·   110 curbside parking spaces along Main Street

    ·   Either a 65 space surface parking lot or a 210 space three-level structure at the existing fire station site,
                                                        nd
        located at the intersection of Acme Street and 2 Street

The proposed Downtown Plan stipulates that each development provide adequate parking off-street or participate
in an in-lieu parking program to be established by the City. The program would allow the City to waive or reduce
the off-street parking requirement for commercial developments, and instead collect an in-lieu fee to construct and
operate the required parking spaces in shared facilities in the Downtown area.

Shared parking is defined as use of a parking space to serve two or more individual uses without conflict or
encroachment. Shared parking could occur if various uses have peak parking demands at different times or on
different days, which would allow drivers for one use to park in a space that would later be used by drivers
accessing the other use. Shared parking can also be used when drivers can visit various uses while parked at
the same location and do not need to drive between different uses. Many central business districts and
downtowns provide central shared parking facilities to reduce the overall parking supply needed in the area.
Thus, the in-lieu parking program would allow higher densities of commercial development and reduce the overall
parking supply in the Downtown area because the shared parking facilities would satisfy the overall parking
demand, and individual developments would not necessarily need to satisfy their own individual peak parking
demand.

The Downtown Plan recommends the following minimum parking requirements for new development:

    ·   Three parking spaces per 1,000 square feet for non-residential uses in the Downtown Core Area and
        Residential/Commercial Conversion Opportunity Areas. Curbside on-street parking maybe counted
        towards these requirements.

    ·   Four parking spaces per 1,000 square feet for first floor non-residential and 3 parking spaces per 1,000
        square feet for upper floor spaces in the Downtown Support Area.

    ·   For multi-family dwelling units in both the Downtown Core Area and Downtown Support Area, one space
        will be required for one or two bedroom units, with each additional bedroom requiring 0.5 spaces.

    ·   For single-family dwelling units in both the Downtown Core Area and Downtown Support Area, one
        space will be required for one or two bedroom units, with three bedrooms requiring one additional space.



                                                                                                                  37
 City of Oakley Downtown Specific Plan ­ Transportation Impact Analysis
 August 2009




These parking requirements are lower than typical suburban parking requirements. Since the Downtown area is
expected to provide a variety of retail and commercial uses in a walkable environment, it is expected to have
lower parking demand than typical suburban shopping centers due to the potential for shared parking between the
developments. To reduce the parking supply needed in the Downtown area, it is recommended that all non-
residential parking be accessible to all users and not reserved for specific developments.

Since the specific projects that would be developed in the Downtown area are not known at this time, their parking
demand can not be estimated. As development applications in the Downtown area are submitted, their
incremental parking demand over parking demand at the time should be estimated to ensure that adequate
overall parking supply is provided through the Downtown area.

Bicycle Parking

The Downtown Plan does not identify any locations for bicycle parking. Although no formal bicycle parking
requirement exists, it is recommended that bicycle parking in the form of secure bicycle racks be provided
throughout the Downtown area to accommodate residents and commercial employees and customers who would
bicycle to the site and to encourage alternative transportation modes.

CONSISTENCY WITH ADOPTED ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION POLICIES, PLANS, OR
PROGRAMS
The City of Oakley General Plan provides several goals and policies that relate to alternative transportation
policies, plans, and programs. These goals and policies include:

Policy 2.8.2    The downtown area should be developed at a pedestrian scale, with adequate sidewalks, street
                crossings, and pedestrian resources.

Goal 3.2        Promote and encourage walking and bicycling

Policy 3.2.1    Promote maximum opportunities for bicycle and pedestrian circulation on existing and new
                roadway facilities.

Policy 3.2.2    Enhance opportunities for bicycle and pedestrian activity in new public and private development
                projects.

Policy 3.2.4    Design new roadway facilities to accommodate bicycle and pedestrian traffic. Include Class I, II,
                or III bicycle facilities as appropriate. Provide sidewalks on all roads, except in cases where very
                low pedestrian volumes and/or safety concerns preclude sidewalks.

Goal 3.3        Provide adequate, convenient, and affordable public transportation.

Policy 3.3.1    Design new roadways and facilities to accommodate public transit.

Policy 3.3.2    Ensure that new public and private development supports public transit.

The proposed Specific Plan, enhanced by the recommendations in the previous sections would not conflict with
the City's adopted alternative transportation policies and plans.

 City of Oakley Downtown Specific Plan ­ Transportation Impact Analysis
 August 2009




FINAL SITE PLAN DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
The CEQA analysis determines whether the design of the project causes significant impacts requiring mitigation.
Based on CEQA criteria, a significant impact would occur if:

    ·   The project substantially increases hazards or congestion due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves) or
        incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment).

    ·   The project results in inadequate emergency access.

    ·   The project conflicts with adopted alternative transportation policies, plans, or programs.

As discussed previously, the design guidelines provided in the proposed the City of Oakley Downtown Specific
Plan would not result in a significant impact. The implementation of the Specific Plan would include applications
of the design guidelines to individual development projects. Impact and Mitigation Measure 4 are identified to
ensure that these guidelines are followed and to avoid potential significant impacts by each individual project.

IMPACT 4:                         The design of the specific development projects and roadways developed under
                                  the Specific Plan may result in increased hazards due to a design feature,
                                  inadequate emergency access, or conflicts with adopted alternative
                                  transportation policies, plans, or programs.

MITIGATION MEASURE 4:             Mitigation of the potential impact can be achieved through a review of the final
                                  design of the specific development projects and roadways by the City Engineer
                                  to ensure the adequacy of the design. The following items should be reviewed
                                  as the Downtown area continues to develop:

                                 A. The number of driveways on Main Street Bypass should be minimized.
                                    These driveways should be limited to right-in/right-out movements only.

                                 B. The interim improvements on Main Street, prior to the completion of the Main
                                    Street Bypass, should be reviewed to ensure that Main Street will continue to
                                    accommodate heavy trucks.

                                 C. The currently signalized Main Street/Vintage Parkway and Main Street/
                                    O'Hara Avenue intersections should be converted to all-way stop-controlled
                                    intersections after the completion of the Main Street Bypass.

                                 D. The design of Main Street, east of the Main Street Bypass should be
                                    reconsidered to better accommodate trucks and bicycles. It is recommended
                                    that the proposed parking lane on the south side of the roadway be eliminate
                                    to widen the outside travel lanes.

                                 E. The design of Downtown roadways should be coordinated with Tri-Delta
                                    Transit to determine the location for bus pullouts and bus shelters on Main
                                    Street adjacent to the project site and to provide pedestrian access between
                                    the bus stops and the major destinations in the Plan area.

                                 F. Roadways within the Downtown area should provide adequate width and
                                    turning radii for emergency access vehicles.




                                                                                                               39

                                  G. Development projects within the Downtown Area should be evaluated and
                                     approved only if they provide adequate emergency access.

                                  H. Development projects within the Downtown area should be evaluated and
                                     approved only if they provide adequate truck access and circulation.

                                  I.   To the extent feasible, non-residential parking should be accessible to all
                                       users and not reserved for specific development projects.

                                  J.   The incremental parking demand for each development project should be
                                       estimated and compared to the overall parking supply to ensure adequate
                                       parking supply in the Downtown area.

                                  K. Bicycle parking should be evaluated and development projects approved
                                     only if they provide adequate bicycle parking facilities provided throughout
                                     the Downtown area.

The impact would be reduced to less-than-significant with the implementation of this mitigation measure.

MODEL VALIDATION RESULTS
 City of Oakley Downtown Specific Plan ­ Transportation Impact Analysis
 July 2009




APPENDIX C - MODEL VALIDATION RESULTS
The CCTA Decennial Countywide Travel Demand Model is available in scenarios that represent years 2000,
2010, 2020, and 2030. To develop a model that closely reflects current conditions in the study area to serve as a
baseline for future analysis, Fehr & Peers modified the CCTA Travel Demand Model to develop a year 2005
scenario. The roadway network for the 2005 scenario was based on the 2000 roadway network and modified to
include roadway improvements within the City of Oakley and surrounding areas that have been completed since
year 2000. The land use input data for the 2005 scenario was developed by interpolating between the model land
uses for years 2000 and 2010. The 2005 land uses within the City of Oakley and the surrounding areas were
further refined to reflect specific development projects that were constructed between 2000 and 2005.

As required by CCTA's Technical Procedures, a sub-area model validation exercise was conducted. The
forecasted 2005 AM and PM peak hour volumes produced by the model were compared with counts collected in
Oakley and northeast Antioch between 2004 and 2006. The model input parameters, such as roadway speeds,
were further adjusted to better validate the baseline 2005 AM and PM peak hour scenarios.

Table C-1 summarizes the validation results for the AM peak hour, while Table C-2 shows the validation results
for the PM peak hour. The 2005 AM peak hour model satisfies three of the six CCTA peak hour validation
criteria. It very nearly satisfies four of the criteria, missing the target for intersections within 15 percent of counts
by one location. As shown in Table C-2, the 2005 PM peak hour model satisfies all six of the CCTA peak hour
validation criteria. In comparison to the existing intersection counts, the 2005 AM peak hour model generally
underestimates volumes by about 10 to 15 percent. The underestimation is across the study area and not in
isolated areas. This pattern of underestimation in the AM peak hour has been observed in other model runs in
the East County area, and may be at least partially due to the fact that East County residents commute relatively
long distances, and thus may begin their morning commute trip earlier than the countywide average AM peak
hour.

As recommended in the CCTA Technical Procedures, intersection turning movement forecasts will not be taken
directly from the model but will be developed using a "Furness"-type process in which the model is used to
estimate the amount of change expected over time. The underestimation of traffic volumes observed in the AM
peak hour model, which leads to the failure to achieve three of the six validation targets, would likely continue to
occur in the future year model scenarios, and thus would be accounted for in the "Furness" process. The 2005
model developed for this analysis is considered adequately validated and appropriate for use in developing future
volume forecasts. Model parameters adjusted to achieve the 2005 model validation results will be included in the
future scenarios to provide consistent results with the validated 2005 results.

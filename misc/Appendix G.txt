Draft Transportation Impact Analysis

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed Hale Signature
Property ("Proposed Project") in the City of Morgan Hill, California. This analysis serves as a supplement to the
Hale Signature Homes General Plan Amendment TIA conducted in 2009, reflecting an updated project size of
108 single-family residential dwelling units compared to 150 dwelling units. This TIA analyzes the proposed
project at a project-level, while the 2009 TIA evaluated the potential transportation impacts under future year 2030
General Plan Conditions as required for all specific project entitlements per the 2010 Morgan Hill TIA Guidelines.
The Proposed Project is bounded by the Union Pacific Railroad tracks to the east, Campoli Drive to the south,
Tarragon Avenue to the north, and Hale Avenue to the west.

The impacts of the Proposed Project were evaluated following the guidelines of the City of Morgan Hill and the
Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), the congestion management agency for Santa Clara County.
Roadway system operations were evaluated under Existing, Project, Near-Term Cumulative No Project, and
Near-Term Cumulative plus Project Conditions.

PROJECT TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
The Proposed Project is estimated to generate 1,116 daily vehicle trips, 85 AM peak-hour trips, and 113 PM
peak-hour trips. While not quantified, the Proposed Project will also generate some trips by other modes,
including walking, bicycling and transit trips.

PROJECT IMPACTS
Based on impact criteria defined by the City of Morgan Hill the Proposed Project is expected to have less-than-
significant impacts at all of the study intersections. Thus, no measures are necessary to mitigate project
transportation impacts. The results of the level of service (LOS) calculations for all scenarios analyzed for this TIA
are summarized in Table ES-1.

Based on the VTA's Congestion Management Program guidelines for freeway analyses, the Proposed Project is
not expected to have a significant impact on the freeway study segments located on US 101 and not mitigation
measures are required.

The Proposed Project would not significantly impact pedestrian, bicycle, or transit facilities. However, the City
should work with the applicant to ensure that sidewalks are provided along the project frontage.

The Proposed Project would not significantly impact emergency access. Prior to the final approval of the project
site plan, the City should confirm that adequate sight distance is provided at all driveways. With this sight distance
review, the Proposed Project would not significantly impact on hazards due to a design feature.

Draft Transportation Impact Analysis
March 12, 2012



1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) conducted for the proposed Hale
Signature Property ("Proposed Project") in the City of Morgan Hill, California. This analysis serves as supplement
to the Hale Signature Homes General Plan Amendment TIA conducted in 2009 which analyzed the impacts of
150 single-family residential dwelling units. This TIA analyzes the proposed project at a project-level, while the
2009 TIA evaluated the potential transportation impacts under future year 2030 General Plan Conditions as
required for all specific project entitlements per the 2010 Morgan Hill TIA Guidelines. The Proposed Project is
generally bounded by the Union Pacific Railroad tracks to the east, Campoli Drive to the south, Tarragon Avenue
to the north, and Hale Avenue to the west. The purpose of the TIA is to identify any potential significant adverse
impacts of the Proposed Project on the surrounding transportation system and to recommend mitigation
measures, if needed. Impacts were evaluated following the guidelines of the City of Morgan Hill and the Santa
Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), the congestion management agency for Santa Clara County.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Proposed Project includes the development of 108 single-family dwelling units which are anticipated to be
built and occupied by the year 2015-2016. Main access to the project site will be via a driveway located off of Hale
Avenue approximately half way between the intersections of Hale Avenue/Tilton Avenue and Hale Avenue/Llagas
Road. The project site is currently vacant land.

STUDY AREA
This analysis evaluated the operations of the following eight (8) study intersections, which were analyzed in the
2009 TIA and were selected in consultation with City staff and based on VTA's guidelines for selecting study
intersections. All intersections are under the jurisdiction of the City of Morgan Hill.

    1. Hale Avenue and Tilton Avenue                              5. Monterey Road and Burnett Avenue

    2. Hale Avenue and Project Driveway (future                   6. Monterey Road and Madrone Parkway
       intersection)
                                                                  7. Monterey Road and Cochrane Road

    4. Monterey Road and Tilton Avenue
This study also included evaluation the following US 101 freeway segments (northbound and southbound), which
were included in the 2009 TIA:

        US 101 between Cochrane Road and Coyote Creek Road

        US 101 between Cochrane Road and Dunne Avenue

ANALYSIS SCENARIOS
Peak traffic conditions generally occur during weekday mornings between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM and between
4:00PM and 6:00 PM in the evenings. The operations of the study intersections were evaluated during the
weekday morning (AM) and evening (PM) peak hours for the following four (4) scenarios:

        Scenario 1:       Existing Conditions ­ Existing volumes obtained from counts, representing peak one-hour
                          traffic conditions during the morning and evening commute periods .

        Scenario 2:       Project Conditions ­ Scenario 1 volumes plus traffic generated by the Proposed Project.

        Scenario 3:       Near-Term Cumulative No Project Conditions ­ Near-Term Cumulative No Project
                          volumes include Existing volumes (Scenario 1) plus traffic generated by approved and
                          pending development projects likely to be completed by the opening year of the project
                          (expected between 2015-2016).

        Scenario 4:       Near-Term Cumulative with Project Conditions ­ Scenario 3 volumes plus traffic
                          generated by the Proposed Project.

Intersection impacts of the Proposed Project were evaluated by comparing the intersection operations for the
following pairs of conditions:

        Project Conditions (Scenario 2) to Existing Conditions (Scenario 1)

        Near-Term Cumulative with Project Conditions (Scenario 4) to Near-Term No Project Conditions
        (Scenario 3).

The City's Approved and Pending Projects list was used to estimate traffic volumes for the Near-Term Cumulative
Conditions. Freeway impacts of the Proposed Project were evaluated following VTA guidelines and were
assessed by adding project trips to freeway volumes established under Existing Conditions (Scenario 1). Project
impacts on bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities and services were also addressed.

LEVEL OF SERVICE METHOD
The operations of roadway facilities are described with the term level of service (LOS). LOS is a qualitative
description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six levels
are defined from LOS A, with the least congested operating conditions, to LOS F, with the most congested
operating conditions. LOS E represents "at-capacity" operations. Operations are described as LOS F when
volumes exceed capacity, resulting in stop-and-go conditions.

Signalized Intersections

The LOS analysis method for signalized intersections approved by the City of Morgan Hill and VTA analyzes
intersection operations based on average control vehicular delay, as described in Chapter 16 of the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) published by the Transportation Research Board, with adjusted saturation flow
rates to reflect conditions in Santa Clara County. Control delay includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up
time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. The average control delay for signalized intersections is
calculated using the TRAFFIX analysis software and is correlated to a LOS designation as shown in Table 1.

Unsignalized Intersections

Operations of the unsignalized study intersections are evaluated using the method contained in Chapter 17 of the
2000 HCM and calculated using the TRAFFIX analysis software. LOS ratings for stop-sign controlled intersections
are based on the average control delay expressed in seconds per vehicle. At two-way or side-street-stop
controlled intersections, control delay is calculated for each movement, not for the intersection as a whole. For
approaches composed of a single lane, delay is computed as the average of all movements in that lane. For all-
way stop-controlled locations, a weighted average delay for the entire intersection is presented. Table 2
summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections.

General Plan Circulation Element LOS Policy

Per the City of Morgan Hill's General Plan (February 2010), the following tiered approach is used to determine
minimum acceptable levels of service at intersections:

           LOS F in the Downtown intersections along Monterey Road between Main and Fifth Street, and along
           Depot Street at First through Fifth Street;

           LOS E for the following intersections and freeway zones:

The City has generally used a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D for unsignalized intersections and
peak hour signal warrant analysis to identify significant traffic impacts. Therefore, the unsignalized study
intersections of Hale Avenue/Tilton Avenue and Hale Avenue/Project Driveway (future intersection) would have a
minimum acceptable threshold of LOS D.

VTA Freeway Segment Level of Service Policy

Freeway segments are evaluated using VTA's analysis procedure, which is based on the density of the traffic flow
using methods described in the 2000 HCM. Density is expressed in passenger cars per mile per lane. The
Congestion Management Program range of densities for freeway segment level of service is shown in Table 3.
The LOS standard for the freeway segments is LOS E.

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT CRITERIA
According to the 2010 CEQA Guidelines, implementation of the Proposed Project would have a significant impact
if it would do any of the following:

        Conflict with an applicable plan, ordinance, or policy establishing measures of effectiveness for the
        performance of the circulation system, taking into account all modes of transportation including mass
        transit and non-motorized travel and relevant components of the circulation system, including, but not
        limited to, intersections, streets, highways and freeways, pedestrian and bicycle paths, and mass transit.

        Conflict with an applicable congestion management program, including, but not limited to, level of service
        standards and travel demand measures or other standards established by the county congestion
        management agency for designated roads or highways.

        Result in a change in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels or a change in
        location that results in substantial safety risks.

        Substantially increase hazards due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous intersections) or
        incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment).

        Result in inadequate emergency access.

        Conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities,
        or otherwise decrease the performance or safety of such facilities.

The CEQA Guidelines are intended to provide general guidance for lead agencies evaluating impacts to the
transportation system. For purposes of evaluating impacts of the Proposed Project, the above significance criteria
are interpreted as described below.

The results of the level of service calculations for Existing Conditions were compared to the results for Project
Conditions to identify significant impacts. The following standards of significance apply to the transportation
impacts discussed in this study. These standards are consistent with the Guidelines for Preparation of
Transportation Impact Reports (City of Morgan Hill, February 2010).




                                                                                                                         7

Signalized Intersection Impact Criteria

The City's LOS standard for the study intersections is LOS D. The City of Morgan Hill has adopted the signalized
intersection impact criteria as defined by the VTA; therefore, traffic impacts at City of Morgan Hill intersections
would occur when the addition of traffic associated with implementation of the Project causes:

      1. Intersection operations to deteriorate from an acceptable level under Existing Conditions to an
         unacceptable level; or,
     2. Exacerbation of unacceptable operations under Existing Conditions by increasing the average
        critical delay by more than four (4) seconds and increasing the critical volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio
        by 0.01 or more at an intersection operating at unacceptable LOS (LOS E or F depending on study
        location) LOS E or LOS F under Project Conditions.
None of the intersections analyzed for this report are designated Congestion Management Program (CMP)
intersections, and no impacts were identified.

Unsignalized Intersection Impact Criteria

Level of service analysis at unsignalized intersections is generally used to determine the need for modifying
intersection control type (i.e. all-way stop or signalization). As part of this evaluation traffic volumes, delay, and
traffic signal warrants are evaluated to determine if the existing intersection control is appropriate.

The City has generally used a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D for unsignalized intersections.
Significant impacts are defined to occur when the addition of project traffic for the worst movement/approach
degrades to LOS E or LOS F and the intersection satisfies the peak hour signal warrants from the 2010 Caltrans
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).

Freeway Impact Criteria

According to VTA's Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines (VTA, 2009) a freeway segment analysis should
be included if the project meets one of the following requirements:

    1.   The proposed development project is expected to add traffic equal to at least one percent of a freeway
         segment's capacity.
    2.   The proposed development project is adjacent to one of the freeway segment's access or egress points
    3.   Based on engineering judgment, Lead Agency staff determines that the freeway segment should be
         included in the analysis.
For mixed-flow lanes, freeway segment capacities are defined as 2,200 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for
four-lane freeway segments and 2,300 vphpl for six-lane freeway segments. HOV lane capacities are defined
between 1,800 to 1,900 vphpl.

If a project meets the criteria outlined above, then the implementation of the Proposed Project could result in a
significant impact if the addition of project traffic on a freeway segment exceeded one of the following thresholds:

    3. The addition of project traffic causes the operating level of a freeway segment to deteriorate from LOS E
       or better under Existing Conditions to LOS F; or
    4. The number of new trips added by a Proposed Project to a segment already operating at LOS F under
       Existing Conditions is more than one percent of the freeway segment capacity

2.     EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the existing conditions of the roadway facilities, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, transit
service, traffic volumes, and intersection operations. A discussion of the method used to calculate intersection
levels of service (LOS) and the corresponding results is also presented in this chapter.

EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK
This section describes the existing roadway network, which is illustrated on Figure 1. Regional access to the site
is provided via US 101 and local access is provided via Monterey Road, Cochrane Road, Madrone Parkway,
Llagas Road, and Tilton Avenue. Each of these roadways is described below:

U.S. Highway 101 (US 101) is a north-south freeway that serves as the primary roadway connection between
Morgan Hill and all other areas of Santa Clara County. US 101 extends north to San Francisco and south to Los
Angeles. The freeway includes six lanes (three mixed-flow lanes in each direction) within most of Morgan Hill.
North of Cochrane Road, US 101 widens to eight lanes including three mixed-flow lanes and one high occupancy
vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction. HOV lanes, also known as diamond or carpool lanes, restrict use to vehicles
with two or more persons (carpool, vanpool, and buses) or motorcycles during the morning (5:00 AM to 9:00 AM)
and evening (3:00 PM to 7:00 PM) commute periods. The Cochrane Road interchange provides primary access
to the project site.

Monterey Road, through Morgan Hill, is generally a four-lane arterial roadway with separate left-turn lanes at
intersections and on-street parking in some areas. Monterey Road extends from San Jose through the downtown
area of Morgan Hill to the City of Gilroy. The speed limit on Monterey Road varies from 45 miles per hour (mph)
north of Cochrane Road to 25 mph between Main Avenue and East Dunne Avenue in downtown. A set of speed
lumps slow traffic through the downtown area.

Cochrane Road is an arterial that extends from Monterey Road east to Anderson Lake. Cochrane Road is a two-
to six-lane facility that provides an interchange with US 101 at the north end of the city. The posted speed limit is
45 mph.

Madrone Parkway is a two-lane undivided collector that extends eastward from its intersection with Monterey
Road and connects with Cochrane Road. The roadway is posted at 35 mph. Per the City's February 2010
General Plan, Madrone Parkway will be extended westward to provide a connection between Monterey Road and
Hale Avenue. This extension is assumed in the 2030 roadway network, and not included in the analysis presented
in this report.

Llagas Road is a collector that extends eastward from the City's western city limits to Old Monterey Road. The
posted speed limit is 25 mph. Between Old Monterey Road and Llagas Creek Drive, the roadway is a two-lane
road that provides left-turn lanes into the intersecting local streets. West of Llagas Creek Drive, Llagas Road is a
two-lane facility.

Tilton Avenue is two-lane collector road that provides a connection between Hale Avenue and Monterey Road.
The posted speed limit is 35 mph.

EXISTING PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE FACILITIES
The mild climate, relatively flat terrain, and proximity of many recreational and non-recreational destinations
provide an ideal environment for walking and bicycling in the City of Morgan Hill. This section describes the
existing pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure in the vicinity of the Proposed Project.




                                                                                                          10

Pedestrian Facilities

Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian signals, and off-street paths that are meant to
provide safe and convenient routes for pedestrians to access destinations such as institutions, businesses, public
transportation, and recreation facilities.

In the vicinity of the project site, marked crosswalks are not provided on the north and west legs of the Tilton
Avenue/Hale Avenue intersection. Crosswalks are also absent at the Monterey Road/Tilton Avenue intersection.
Other study intersections provide limited crosswalks in each direction to bring continuity with adjacent sidewalks.
Sidewalk facilities are provided on the following roadway segments within the vicinity of the project.

        Eastside of Hale Avenue between Tilton Avenue and northern end of the project parcel;

        Llagas Road between Hale Avenue and Old Monterey Avenue;

        Westside of Old Monterey Avenue between Llagas Road and Monterey Road;

        Eastside of Monterey Road between Cochrane Road and Old Monterey Road;

        Discontinuous segments along Monterey Road between Tilton Avenue and Cochrane Road.

Bicycle Facilities

Bikeway planning and design in California typically relies on the guidelines and design standards established by
                                                                                             th
Caltrans in the Highway Design Manual (Chapter 1000: Bikeway Planning and Design, 5 Edition, California
Department of Transportation, January 2001). Chapter 1000 follows standards developed by the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA), and identifies specific design standards for various conditions and bikeway-to-roadway relationships.
Under California Law, bicyclists are allowed to use all roadways in California unless posted closed. Therefore,
even for the roadways that have no designated (or planned) bikeways identified, a majority are open for cycling.

Caltrans standards provide for three (3) distinct types of bikeway facilities, as generally described below and
shown on the accompanying figures.




                                                                                                        11

        Class I Bikeway (Bike Path) provides a completely separate right-of-way and is designated for the
        exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians with vehicle and pedestrian cross-flow minimized. In general,
        bike paths serve corridors not served by streets and highways or where sufficient right-of-way exists to
        allow such facilities to be constructed away from the influence of parallel streets and numerous vehicle
        conflicts.




        Class II Bikeways (Bike Lanes) are lanes for bicyclists adjacent to the outer vehicle travel lanes. These
        lanes have special lane markings, pavement legends, and signage. Bicycle lanes are generally five (5)
        feet wide. Adjacent vehicle parking and vehicle/pedestrian cross-flow are permitted.




        Class III Bikeway (Bike Route) are designated by signs or pavement markings for shared use with
        pedestrians or motor vehicles, but have no separated bike right-of-way or lane striping. Bike routes serve
        either to: a) provide continuity to other bicycle facilities, or b) designate preferred routes through high
        demand corridors.




                                                                                                        12

Draft Transportation Impact Analysis

EXISTING TRANSIT SERVICE
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) operates fixed route, commuter, and paratransit bus
service and light rail service (LRT) in Santa Clara County. VTA provides two bus routes (one local and one
regional) that serve the project area. The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board operates Caltrain commuter rail
service between San Francisco and San Jose, with weekday commute-hour service to Morgan Hill and Gilroy.
Monterey Salinas Transit (MST) operates transit service in Monterey County, and provides express bus service to
Morgan Hill and San Jose.

Existing transit service near the project is illustrated on Figure 4 and is discussed in more detail below. Currently
VTA Route 16 provides four (4) transit stops and VTA Route 68 provides two (2) transit stops within a half-mile of
the Proposed Project site. Table 4 summarizes hours of operation and service frequencies for these bus routes.

Caltrain provides regular train service between San Jose and San Francisco. Service extends south to Gilroy
through Morgan Hill during commute periods, with three northbound trips during the AM peak period and three
southbound trips during the PM peak period stopping at both the Gilroy and Morgan Hill Caltrain Stations. The
Morgan Hill Caltrain Station is located east of Depot Street between First and Second Streets, approximately two
(2) miles from the project site.

EXISTING VOLUMES AND LANE CONFIGURATIONS
The operations of the study intersections were evaluated during the weekday AM and PM peak hours.
Intersection operations were evaluated for the highest one-hour volume counted between each of the 7:00 and
9:00 AM and the 4:00 and 6:00 PM peak periods. Intersection turning movement counts were conducted in
November 2011.The traffic counts are included in Appendix A.

Figure 4 presents the existing AM and PM peak-hour turning movement volumes, the existing intersection lane
configurations, and traffic control devices for the seven existing study intersections.

EXISTING INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Existing intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak-hour turning movement volumes as illustrated
on Figure 5 were used as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for Existing Conditions
are presented in Table 5. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation sheets. Measured against the City
of Morgan Hill LOS standard, all study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels during both peak
periods.

EXISTING FREEWAY MAINLINE LEVELS OF SERVICE
Freeway segment densities reported in the latest (2010) VTA's Monitoring and Conformance Report were used to
calculate the levels of service for the key freeway segments during the AM and PM peak hours. The results of the
LOS analysis for Existing Conditions are presented in Table 6. All freeway segments operate at or above the
VTA's LOS E standard.

FIELD OBSERVATIONS
Field observations of the study intersections were conducted in November 2011 to verify their operations. In
general, observations indicated that all of the study intersections are operating at or near the calculated levels of
service. Some vehicle queuing was observed at Monterey Road/Burnett Avenue, Cochrane Avenue/Monterey
Road, and Old Monterey Road/Monterey Road. However, most of the vehicle queues typically cleared these
intersections within one cycle. The unsignalized intersection of Hale Avenue/Tilton Avenue was observed to
operate acceptably with no significant queuing.

Field observations at the intersection of Tilton Avenue/Monterey Road verified a preemption phase due to the
passing of trains on the nearby railroad tracks. While the presence of a train temporarily causes queuing that

cycles or less than five (5) minutes after a train departed the area.

Minimal bicycle and pedestrian traffic was observed in the vicinity of the project site.

3. PROJECT CONDITIONS
The impacts of the Proposed Project on the surrounding roadway system are discussed in this chapter. First, the
method used to estimate the amount of traffic generated by the Proposed Project is described. Then, the results
of the LOS calculations for Project Conditions are presented. Project Conditions are defined as Existing
Conditions plus traffic generated by the Proposed Project. Since the existing site is vacant, Project conditions
assume existing transportation conditions plus traffic generated by the 108 single-family dwelling units. A
comparison of intersection operations under Project Conditions is presented and the impacts of the project on the
study intersections are discussed. Site access, on-site circulation, parking and non-automobile modes are also
addressed in this chapter.

PROJECT TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
The amount of traffic associated with the project was estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2)
trip distribution, and (3) trip assignment. In the first step, the amount of traffic entering and exiting the project area
was estimated on a daily and peak-hour basis. In the second step, the direction vehicles use to approach and
depart the site was estimated. The trips were assigned to specific street segments and intersection turning
movements in the third step and added to the existing traffic volumes to develop Existing plus Project traffic
volumes. The results of the process for this analysis are described in the following sections.

Trip Generation

The Proposed Project allows for the development of up to 108 single-family homes on the 30 acres project site.
Trip generation was calculated using the Single-Family Dwelling Unit (Land Use 210) rates identified in Trip
Generation, 8th Edition (Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), 2008). The peak-hour trip generation trip
estimates are presented in Table 7. A 108 single-family home development is estimated to generate 1,116 daily
vehicle trips, 85 AM peak-hour vehicle trips (21 inbound and 64 outbound), and 113 PM peak-hour vehicle trips
(71 inbound and 42 outbound).

Trip Distribution
                                                                                             1
Project vehicle trip distribution was primarily based on a "select zone " analysis using the City's travel demand
forecasting (TDF) model. Location of supporting land uses in the vicinity of the project area, information from



1
    Select zone analysis is used to determine the origin and destination of trips from a project zone to all other zones in the TDF model.

previous traffic studies in the area, and input from City staff was used to refine the trip distribution. Figure 6
shows the proposed trip distribution for the project. Approximately 40 percent of trips are expected to travel north
of the City of Morgan Hill and 25 percent to destinations south of the City. The remaining trips are spread to
destinations within the City of Morgan Hill.

Trip Assignment

Trips generated by the Proposed Project were assigned to the roadway system based on the directions of
approach and departure described above. As shown in the site plan (Figure 2), the project has access to the
surrounding roadway system via one driveway off Hale Avenue and another connection to Saffron Drive to the
residential development north of the project site. The site plan also shows that the project site will connect to Old
Monterey Road, however, the Old Monterey Road connection to Llagas Road is not anticipated to occur by the
opening year of the proposed project; and therefore this connection was not assumed in the trip assignment.
Access to Llagas Road via Old Monterey Road would not significantly change the results of this study. The trip
assignments for the AM and PM peak hours are shown on Figure 6. Project trips were added to existing traffic
volumes in Figure 5 to establish intersection volumes for Project Conditions, as shown on Figure 7.

PROJECT INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
The results of the intersection LOS calculations for Project Conditions are presented in Table 8. The results for
Existing Conditions are included for comparison purposes, along with the projected increases in critical delay and
critical volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Critical delay represents the delay associated with the critical movements
of the intersection, or the movements that require the most "green time" and have the greatest effect on overall
intersection operations. The changes in critical delay and critical V/C ratio between Existing and Project
Conditions are used to identify significant impacts.

Under Project Conditions, all study intersections are estimated to operate at acceptable levels of service, at LOS
C or better during both peak hours. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation sheets.

PROJECT FREEWAY SEGMENT LEVELS OF SERVICE
Project-generated traffic volumes were added to existing traffic volumes for each freeway mainline segment.
These volumes were then used to re-calculate density for each segment under Project Conditions. The resulting
freeway segment operations are presented in Table 9.

According to CMP guidelines, freeway segments to which a proposed development is projected to add trips equal
to or greater than one percent of the freeway segment's capacity must be evaluated. The freeway segments
immediately north and south of Cochrane Road were reviewed to determine if a significant amount of project
traffic would be added to these freeway segments. A capacity of 2,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for
freeway segments with three or more lanes was used in the freeway analysis.

Table 9 outlines the estimated number of project trips added to the freeway segments. The addition of project
trips is not estimated to degrade acceptable LOS E freeway operations to unacceptable levels (LOS F).
Therefore, no additional freeway segment analysis is required for the Proposed Project.

A few of the intersections (such as Hale Avenue/Llagas Road, Monterey Road/Burnett Avenue, and Monterey
Road/Madrone Parkway) show a reduction in the average delay with the addition of project traffic, which is
counter-intuitive. The average delay values in the table are weighted averages. Weighted average delays will be
                                                                2
reduced when traffic is added to a movement with a low delay. Conversely, relatively small volume increases to
movements with high delays can substantially increase the weighted average delay.




2
  For example, if you have one movement with 10 vehicles with a delay of 100 seconds and another movement with 400 vehicles and 10
seconds of delay, the weighted average delay is calculated as (100 seconds X 10 vehicles + 10 seconds X 400 vehicles) / 410 vehicles =
12.2 seconds per vehicle. Now if you add 100 vehicles to the movement with 10 seconds of delay, the weight average is calculated as (100
seconds X 10 vehicles + 10 seconds X 500 vehicles) / 510 vehicles = 11.8 seconds per vehicle. The weighted average delay improves, even
though more vehicles are added.


                                                                                                                                      24

TRANSIT, PEDESTRIAN, AND BICYCLE FACILITIES
Currently VTA Route 16 provides four (4) transit stops and VTA Route 68 provides two (2) transit stops within a
half-mile of the Proposed Project site. Patrons utilizing Routes 121,168 or Caltrain to access the project site would
have to walk more than a half-mile to the nearest bus stop or Caltrain station. Given the project's location to these
facilities, transit ridership generated by the Proposed Project is expected to be minimal and would not conflict with
existing or planned transit facilities.

Currently no sidewalk exists adjacent to the project site on Hale Avenue east of the project site. The project
should provide sidewalks along its frontage to improve pedestrian access to adjacent land uses. With the addition
of a sidewalk along the project frontage pedestrian circulation is expected to be adequate.

As identified in the City's 2008 Bikeways Master Plan Update, and shown on Figure 3, a Class II bicycle facility is
proposed to be constructed on Hale Avenue, Llagas Road, and Tilton Avenue near the project site. On the east
side of the project site, the existing rail road tracks provide a barrier to Monterey Road which is designated as a
Class II bicycle facility. Bicyclists traveling east of Monterey Road can cross the railroad tracks at an at-grade
crossing located at the intersection of Tilton Avenue/Monterey Road. The Proposed Project does not conflict with
any adopted plan, policy, or facility.

PROJECT ON-SITE CIRCULATION AND ACCESS
Main access to the project site occurs along Hale Avenue. As shown on Figure 8, there are a total of two
proposed access points. Each proposed access point is discussed in further detail below.



                                                                                                                              25

Access Point #1 ­ Project driveway located off of Hale Avenue approximately a half-mile south of the Hale
Avenue/Tilton Avenue intersection.

Access Point #2 ­ Saffron Drive is proposed to be extended from Tarragon Avenue southward into the project
site. This will provide access to the north side of the project site.

As discussed under the project trip assignment, the site plan also shows that the project site will connect to Old
Monterey Road, however, the Old Monterey Road connection to Llagas Road is not anticipated to occur by the
opening year of the proposed project; and therefore this connection was not assumed in the trip assignment.
Access to Llagas Road via Old Monterey Road would not significantly change the results of this study.

Internal Traffic Control Devices

Traffic control devices at the internal intersections are not specified on the site plan. It is recommended that all-
way stop control be considered at the intersection of "E Street/Madrone Parkway" and "A" Street/"D" Stree.t. Side-
street stop-controls should be considered for installation at the following locations and indicated in Figure 8:

        eastbound approach of intersection of "B" Street/"D" Street

        southbound approach of intersection "C" Street/ "D" Street

        eastbound approach of intersection "C" Street/ "E" Street

        westbound approach of intersection "F" Street/ "E" Street

        northbound approach of intersection "F" Street/ "H" Street

        southbound approach of intersection "G" Street/ "H" Street

        eastbound approach of intersection "F" Street/ Old Monterey Road

        eastbound approach of intersection "G" Street/ Old Monterey Road

Emergency Vehicle Access

Emergency vehicle access considers two factors: whether the project site is accessible to emergency vehicles
from other areas of the City (regional accessibility) and whether the individual parcels or sites within the project
are accessible by various types of emergency vehicles (internal accessibility).

The project site plan provides three vehicle access locations for various areas of the site, which are connected by
an internal roadway network. The project site itself is accessible through a variety of roadways, which connect to
the remaining areas of the City of Morgan Hill. The most likely access route would be via Hale Avenue. The
Project site is anticipated to be serviced by the El Toro fire station located approximately one half (1/2) of a mile
from the project site.

Based on these considerations, we can consider the emergency vehicle access to be generally adequate and a
significant impact is not anticipated to occur.

On-Site Pedestrian Connections

The Proposed Project provides a sidewalk along one or both sides of all internal streets. A sidewalk is also
proposed along the project frontage on Hale Avenue. As shown on Figure 8, to improve pedestrian safety
crosswalks are recommended at the intersection of the project driveway and "E" Street. To facilitate pedestrian
connectivity from the project site to the proposed sidewalk on Hale Avenue, pedestrian access points are
recommend from "A" Court, "B" Court, and "E" Street to Hale Avenue.

Sight Distance

At this time, we are unable to verify if there is adequate sight distance at the various driveways and internal
intersections since the project site plan does not provide details regarding landscaping, sound walls, and other
related items. Based on our review of other traffic studies, inadequate sight distance often results from the
improper placement of landscaping, sound walls, and signs. Since the site plan does not detail these items, we
cannot verify that the project provides adequate sight distance. Prior to the final approval of the project site plan,
the City should confirm that adequate sight distance is provided at all driveways.

ON-SITE PARKING FOR VEHICLES
The City's Municipal Code, Section 18.50.020, requires two covered parking spaces per single-family residential
dwelling unit and one space per four units for guest parking; this results in a required supply of 216 covered
parking spaces and 27 guest parking spaces. Guest parking spaces may be located on street or located at off-
street mid-block locations and in close proximity to recreational amenities. The Municipal Code states that guest
spaces must be located less than 150 feet from the residential dwellings they are intended to serve. The project
site plan does not specify parking supply. Thus, the Proposed Project parking would be reviewed at the time that
building permits are requested.

INTERSECTION IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The impacts of the Proposed Project were evaluated by comparing intersection operations with the Project to
Existing Conditions using the City's 2010 General Plan Circulation Element LOS policies and the significance
criteria described above. Based on the analysis presented above the Proposed Project would have a less-than-
significant impact on all of the study intersections.

FREEWAY IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The freeway impacts of the Proposed Project were evaluated based on VTA's guidelines. As shown in Table 8,
the project is not projected to add new trips greater than one percent of the freeway segment capacity to any of
the study freeway segments. Therefore, no additional freeway segment analysis is required and the Proposed
Project would have a less-than-significant impact on the study freeway segments.

PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE, AND TRANSIT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The City's Guidelines for Preparation of Transportation Impact Reports does not specify impact criteria for
pedestrian, bicycle, and transit impacts. However, these impacts are generally evaluated based on whether a

                                                                                                           28

Proposed Project would: 1) conflict with existing or planned pedestrian, bicycle, or transit facilities, or 2) create
walking, bicycling, or transit use demand without providing adequate and appropriate facilities for non-motorized
mobility.

The Proposed Project is not expected to increase the biking, or transit demand to a level where it could not be
accommodated by existing or planned facilities. Currently no sidewalks are provided on Hale Avenue along the
project frontage. With the provision of sidewalks on Hale Avenue along the project frontage, the Proposed Project
would have a less-than-significant impact on pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities and services.

PROJECT ON-SITE CIRCULATION AND ACCESS
The Proposed Project is expected to result in adequate emergency access and not conflict with any policies
identified in the City's 2010 General Plan Circulation Element. A review of the project site plan indicated that the
internal roadway network is adequate and provides access to and from various areas within the development.
Thus, the Proposed Project would have a less-than-significant impact on emergency access.

At this time, we are unable to verify if there is adequate sight distance at the various driveways and internal
intersections since the project site plan does not provide details regarding landscaping, sound walls, and other
related items. Prior to the final approval of the project site plan, the City should confirm that adequate sight
distance is provided at all driveways. With this sight distance review, the Proposed Project would have a less-
than-significant impact on hazards due to a design feature.

4. NEAR-TERM CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS
This chapter presents the results of the level of service calculations under Near-Term Cumulative Conditions with
and without the project. Near-Term Cumulative No Project Conditions are defined as conditions prior to
completion of the project in 2015, which is the projected completion date. Traffic volumes for Near-Term
Cumulative No Project Conditions comprise existing volumes plus traffic generated by all foreseen development
projects that would affect the transportation system in the study area, including "approved but not yet built or not
occupied," as well as pending development projects. Approved, not occupied, and pending projects account for
local growth in the study area. Near-Term Cumulative plus Project Conditions are defined as Near-Term
Cumulative No Project Conditions plus traffic generated by the proposed project.

Vehicle trips from "approved but not yet built or not occupied" developments projects and from pending
development projects in the study area were added. Trip generation estimates were obtained from their
respective traffic reports or estimated based on trip generation rates published in the Institute of Transportation
                                th
Engineers Trip Generation (8 Edition). The trips for each of the projects were then assigned to the roadway
network based on the relative locations of complementary land uses, as well as, existing and estimated future
travel patterns. Appendix C contains a list of approved and not occupied projects. The trips for each of the
approved, not occupied, and pending development projects were added to the existing volumes, to represent
Near-Term Cumulative No Project Conditions, as shown on Figure 9.

NEAR-TERM CUMULATIVE IMPROVEMENTS
Given that the projected completion year of the project is 2015, no approved and funded transportation network
improvements were assumed to be constructed prior to project completion. Therefore, the existing roadway
network was used for the near-term cumulative analysis.

NEAR-TERM CUMULATIVE NO PROJECT INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE
Figure 8 illustrates the AM and PM peak hour intersection turning movement volumes for the study intersections
under Near-Term Cumulative No Project Conditions. These volumes were used to calculate the levels of service
for the existing study intersections under this scenario. Table 10 presents the Near-Term Cumulative General
Plan No Project Conditions. All of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under the Near-Term Cumulative No Project Conditions.

NEAR-TERM CUMULATIVE WITH PROJECT INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
The estimated trips generated from the Proposed Project (Figure 6) were added to the traffic volumes from the
Near-Term Cumulative No Project Conditions (Figure 9) to estimate Near-Term Cumulative with Project
Conditions. The volumes used in this analysis are presented on Figure 10.

The results of the LOS analysis for Near-Term Cumulative with Project Conditions are presented in Table 10.
Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation sheets. All of the study intersections are projected to operate
at acceptable levels of service under this scenario.

As noted under Project Conditions, several of the intersections such as Hale Avenue/Llagas Road, Monterey
Road/Burnett Avenue, and Monterey Road/Madrone Parkway show a reduction in average delay with the addition
of project traffic, which is counter-intuitive. The average delay values in the table are weighted averages.
Weighted average delays will be reduced when traffic is added to a movement with a low delay. Conversely,

Draft Transportation Impact Analysis

NEAR-TERM CUMULATIVE INTERSECTION OPERATIONS SUMMARY
The impacts of the Proposed Project were evaluated by comparing intersection operations under Near-Term
Cumulative with Project Conditions to Near-Term Cumulative no Project Conditions using the same significance
criteria identified in Chapter 3. All of the study intersections would operate at acceptable LOS under Near-Term
Cumulative Conditions with Project Conditions; therefore, the Proposed Project would have a less-than-
significant impact on traffic operations under Near-Term Cumulative conditions.

Since the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable LOS under Near-Term Cumulative
conditions, the Proposed Project would have a less-than-significant impact on traffic operations when
comparing the Near-Term Cumulative with Project Conditions to Existing Conditions.

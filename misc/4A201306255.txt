RECOMMENDATION

Staff recommends the City Council introduce the ordinance approving the Development Agreement,
and adopt the motion approving the Stage II Design subm ittal for the Central +Wilson project.

BACKGROUND I ANALYSIS

EXISTING CONDITIONS

The proposed project site ("Project Site") is located on the southeast corner of Centra l and Wilson
Avenues, in the Downtown Specific Plan's Broadway Center District (Subarea A). The Project Site
features a 37 ,946 SF lot currently occupied by two commercial retail uses (Big 5 Sporting Goods
and Sit & Sleep). The applicant is also proposing to vacate the adjacent alley to the west and
incorporate it into the Project Site , for a total area of 41 ,746 square feet; the alley vacation will be
presented for Council consideration at a later date.

PROPOSED PROJECT

Holland Partners (the "Developer") is proposing to develop 153 multi-fam ily residential rental units
with either 4,900 SF of commercial space ("Option A") or five live-work units ("Option B") in a
"pod ium" type mixed-use design ("Project"). The exterior of the building remains the same whether
there is commercial or live work at the ground floor along Central Avenue. The "U"-shaped build ing
features studio , one , two , and three-bedroom units that surround a central courtyard. The Project is
six stories with an overall height of approximately 85 feet (Exhibit 1).

Projects within the "Broadway Center" District, Subarea A may use any combination of incentives to
increase the perm itted height from six stories/95 feet to 12 stories/185 feet, and the FAR from 3.0 to
5.2. The Project height is six stories/85 feet, which is in keeping w ith the permitted story/height
limits, but the proposed 4.4 FAR exceeds the limits permitted by right. The Project is eligible for a
height and FAR bonus per Chapter 7 of the DSP by offering 3,398 SF of publicly accessible open
space (1 ,311 SF greater than the minimum requirement of 5% of the lot area or 2,087 SF). The
Project's additional public open space is comprised of a covered plaza at the Central-Wilson
Avenue corner.

Code-required parking is provided for either Option A or B. The Project would provide 223 spaces
consisting of 191 standard spaces and 24 spaces in a tandem configuration. The majority of the
parking w ill be in the two subterranean levels of the parking garage, with 41 spaces provided at the
ground floor level. Two vehicular access points are proposed: one along the southerly property line
on Central Avenue and another on Wilson Avenue where the alley is to be vacated. The residential
parking will be separated from the guests and commercial customers w ith a gate.

STAGE II DESIGN REVIEW

City Council approved the Stage I (Schematic) Design Review on March 19, 2013 without additional
comment. The Project's Stage II Design subm ission has been reviewed by City staff and evaluated
based on the design standards, guidelines, policies, and intentions of the DSP (Exhibit 2). Staff has
determined the Project is ready for Stage II Final Design consideration by the City Council.

The Centrai+Wilson proposal will be the third in a sequence of transformative buildings on Wilson
Avenue by the same development team. The first and largest project , Brand+Wilson, will occupy

                                                                                                      2
the long-vacant parcel in the middle the Brand Boulevard retail experience, and appropriately will
have the most expressive architectural treatment of the three projects. The second, Orange+
Wilson, is a six-story 166-unit residential-only project, planned for the site occupied by the recently
demolished one-story Joann's House of Fabric building. Centrai+Wilson completes this lineup and
echoes many of the design themes found in the first two buildings.

The Centrai+Wilson building has a basic U-shaped footprint with an east-facing courtyard, which
mirrors and extends the courtyard of the adjacent Orange+Wilson project. As such, the building has
a six-story presence facing the two streets, although the courtyard overlooks Central Avenue
through a two-story high orange portal that punctures the fa9ade. The Central fa9ade has an almost
commercial appearance, designed as a large single mass or "bar" floating above two-story high
storefronts and accented by a strict grid of alternating grey and black projecting balconies as well
as the orange portal. The bar is open-ended at the north and south with expansive floor-to-ceiling
windows, creating a five-story high picture window that echoes a similar design feature on the
Brand+Wilson project. The Wilson fa9ade, in contrast, is more "residential" in character, with the
residential lobby and lounges opening to the sidewalk. Above, the fa9ade is more playful with an
asymmetrical pattern of cantilevered balconies and material finishes, including cement fiber board
siding elements that compliment similar features on the adjacent Orange+Wilson project.

Together, the three +Wilson projects, along with the proposed 172-room Marriott Courtyard Hotel
directly north of the site, will dramatically change the look and functionality of Wilson Avenue.
These projects will bring improved and wider sidewalks, new storefronts uses and additional
population to Wilson , making it the primary pedestrian connections between Brand Boulevard and
Central Avenue and one of the more significant streets in the Downtown.

The project is consistent with the Downtown Specific Plan (" DSP") standards and guidelines, and
identical to the well-developed Stage I design unanimously approved on March 5, 2013. Approval of
the Stage II design is recommended with the following conditions:

1) Balconies overlooking Central Avenue shall be fabricated from architectural metal, alucobond,
   cement panels or a similarly high-quality material as approved by the Principal Urban Designer.

2) Planters along the sidewalk shall be clad in architectural metal, tilework, burnished block,
   finished concrete or a similarly high-quality material as approved by the Principal Urban
   Designer.

DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

Development Agreements are regulated by State statute (Government Code §§65864 through
65869.5). This proposed Development Agreement (DA) is a typical development agreement that
"freezes" and vests zoning and other requirements in order to provide certainty between the
entitlement and building permit phase of a complex development (Exhibit 3).

The Developer is requesting a DA to preserve the Project's entitlements for a 14 year term . The
property is currently occupied by a retail tenant under a lease with two 5 year renewal options. T he
current lease term expires in November 2014, and if the tenant exercises both lease options the
term could end in November 2024. The DA will vest development rights for implementation of the
Project for the lease term (including the option periods) plus two years following expiration the lease
to assure adequate time for plan check review and financing once property becomes vacant.


                                                                                                   3
The DA provides two pre-payment options for payment of the Parks and Library Development
Impact Fees ("Fees"): (i) the Developer may pay 100% of the Fees at the close of escrow on the
property or (ii) the Developer may pay 50% of the Fees within the one year anniversary of the
recording date of the DA with payment of the remaining balance payable at any time after the initial
fee payment but prior to the issuance of building permits. Each 50% payment will be at the rate in
pace at the time of payment. If the Developer chooses to forgo the pre-payment options, the
Developer will be responsible for payment of the Parks and Library Development Impact Fees per
Ordinance 5575 (or as it may be amended by City Council). The early Fees payments will not be
eligible for a refund if the Project is not constructed or if the scope of the Project is reduced.

The DA will provide acknowledgements, agreements and assurances on the part of the Developer
and City. As noted, the DA provides two non-refundable pre-payment options for the Parks and
Development Impact Fees; all other fees, including any future impact fees the City might adopt, are
not fixed by the DA. The Project will be subject to those Building Codes and other uniform codes in
effect at the t ime the Developer applies for building permits.

T he DSP requires that developers utilizing the incentive program enter into either a statutory
development agreement with the City or a covenant. The DA vests the right to proceed with the
Project using the open space incentive for the term of the DA. The DA incorporates the incentive
permitting an increase in FAR, the Stage II Final Design, and a scope of development assuring the
incentive is only applicable to the Project as approved by the City Council.

As required by State statute, the Planning Commission reviewed the proposed Development
Agreement on June 5, 2013 and voted to recommend its approval to City Council.

CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA) REVIEW

An addendum has been prepared to the previously certified Downtown Specific Plan Environmental
Impact Report (Exhibit 4). The addendum states that Project does not result in any new adverse
impacts, nor does it increase the severity of any impacts identified in the EIR adopted by City
Council in October 2006.

PUBLIC NOTICE

The Code requires publication of public notices of when the Council considers approval of
entitlements such as design review. Staff has published all required notices in the Glendale News
Press and has mailed copies of the notices to all property owners and occupants within the 500' of
the project. A public notice has also been posted on-site.

FISCAL IMPACT

The fiscal impact of the Project is consistent with other high density residential projects. When
completed, the Project will generate new property taxes and fees.

The Developer estimates a Project value of $23.8M. The City receives 17.76% of the property tax.
Based on the estimated value, the Project would generate an estimated $42,300 annually in property
tax to the General Fund. Additionally, the Project will also pay an in lieu Art Fee of approximately
$238,000, Parks and Library Development Impact Fees of $1,106,000 (if paid by December 151), school
fees in the amount of $505,600, and approximately $388,000 in building permit/plan check fees. There
will be an undetermined cost associated with the increased public service delivery to the Project.
                                                                                                    4
A summary of the anticipated Project generated revenue is estimated below:

       Property Tax (annual)                               $42,300
       In Lieu Art Fee                                    $238,000
       Park and Library Impact Fee                      $1,106,000
       Permit/Plan Check Fees                             $388,000
       School Fee                                         $505,600

       Re:    Stage 2- Design Development Review for 130 North Central Avenue
              Central + Wilson Project by Holland Partners


The following is an evaluation of the above project against the design standards, guidelines,
policies and intentions of the Downtown Specific Plan based on drawings prepared by Carrier
Johnson, Inc. , dated April29, 2013. Summary comments are provided on the final page of this
memo.

Context

The project is located at the southeast corner of Central and Wilson Avenues in the Broadway
Center District of the Downtown Specific Plan (DSP), directly west of the Orange+Wilson and
Brand+Wilson projects by the same development team. Across the street to the north is the site
of the proposed 11-story 172-room Marriott Courtyard Hotel and to the south is a multi-story
office building fronting Broadway. With the completion of these surrounding development
proposals, the DSP's vision for this area of downtown will essentially be complete, with the
exception of the low-scale retail properties across Centra l Avenue to the west. Under the DSP,
the west side of Central could be developed with 6-story mixed-use buildings, similar to the
proposed project and its neighbors.

Both Wilson and Central Avenues as they front the site are identified by the DSP as "Secondary
Frontage Streets. " This designation imposes some design and use restrictions for the ground
floor, but allows for residential stoops, live-work units, as well as retail uses and storefront
designs.

Project Description

· Land Use (see DSP Chapter 3)- The project is a 6-story, mixed-use building that includes
  153 residential units and either 4 ,900 sf of commercial space (Option A) or five llve-work
  spaces (Option B) fronting Central Avenue . These uses are permitted within the DSP
  Broadway Center (Subarea A) district.
                                                                                                    Council Stage 2- Design Development Review for 160 North Central Avenue
                                                                                                                                                              June 23, 2013


Project Design I Design Review Analysis

Existing Buildings, Adaptive Reuse, and/or Historic Preservation

· Existing Buildings (see DSP Section 4.2.2)- The project site currently features two, one-story
  retail buildings: Big 5 Sporting Goods and Sit 'n Sleep. Both businesses will be relocated and
  the buildings will be demolished as part of this project.

Overall Site Plan

· Site Plan- The building has a basic U or C shaped plan, with a central courtyard opening to
   the east facing the Orange+Wilson project across an existing dead-end alley. The applicant
   proposes to vacate this alley to increase the total project site to 41 ,7 46 square feet. However,
   the vacated alley will still serve as primary vehicle access for the residents. A secondary
   driveway for commercial patrons and loading vehicles is located off Central Avenue and is
   intended for right-in I right-out traffic. The parking structure is obscured from the public
   sidewalks by the residential lobby, lounges, and storefronts that face the streets . Pedestrian
   access from the garage to the sidewalk is provided through an elegant passage that leads to
   the project's public plaza open space at the street corner. The project features a courtyard for
   the residents on the second floor that will connect with and extend the courtyard of the
 . Orange+Wilson project. Mitigating the sense claustrophobia the two mirrored courtyards
   might create is the break between the two buildings created by the vacated alley, and a two-
   story, cut-through hole or portal in the center of the Central elevation that visually connects
   the courtyards to the street.

· Setbacks (see DSP Section 4.2.7)- All projects in the DSP are required to maintain an
  average 12 foot setback from the curb to the ground floor building face. Although the
  proposed building occupies the majority of the site area, the facade is set back the required
  distance from the curb, with wide sidewalks on Central and landscaped parkways and
  planters on Wilson. The project features a larger setback at the corner of Central and Wilson
  creating a public plaza area that is a reflective nod to the approved hotel common plaza area
  directly north across Wilson Avenue.                 ·

· Open Space and Landscape (see DSP Chapter 5)- The DSP requires 10 percent of the
  gross site area be dedicated for open space, with an additional 140 square feet for each
  residential unit. Of this open space, an area equal to five percent of the gross site should be
  usable and accessible to the general public. This may be provided by additional sidewalk
  area , outdoor cafes, lobby forecourts, or public gardens. The remaining open space may be
  comprised of individual balconies, private courtyards, roof decks, or street patios . As detailed
  in the following chart, the project exceeds these basic numerical standards .
                                                                                          . ..................................... """""!""""""""""""' .................................. .......................- ..................._ ,,,,,_ _ .......- .........,_

     The public open space is comprised of a plaza adjacent to the lobby at the north-east corner
     of the lot (tucked under the building and connecting the garage to the sidewalk), a patio area
     outside the residents' lobby/lounge, and the setbacks along the Central and Wilson facades.
     As indicated in the diagrams and calculations on page A 1.1 of the submission , the public
     open space area exceeds the minimum limit by 1,169 sf or 2.8%. Therefore , the project is
     eligible for a height and density bonus according to the standards of Chapter 7 in the DSP.

     Common open space for building residents is located on two elevated courtyard levels and
     within three amenity rooms. There is a 4,650 sf courtyard on the mezzanine level along the
     east property line which will connect with the recently approved mezzanine courtyard deck of
     the Orange +Wilson project to create a combined courtyard. The mezzanine level also
     includes a pair of amenity rooms to augment the ground level lounge. At the second level in
     the center of the U-shaped building is an open east-west courtyard (4,962 sf). The project
     also provides 8,042 sf of private balconies in addition to the above shared common spaces
     (for a total open space of 14,881 sf). Note: The open space calculations presume Option B,
     with 153 residential units and five live-work units, for a total of 158 units at 140 sf per unit. If
     Option A is developed, the project exceeds the requirement by 700 sf

        The proposal includes a detailed landscape plan, which illustrates street-level planters and
        enhanced sidewalk paving, as well as planters, seating, cabanas, and a pool on the courtyard
        levels.

Mass and Scale

· Height and Massing (see DSP Sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4 and 4 .2.5)- As detailed in the following
  chart, the Broadway Center district of DSP has two different height and density thresholds,
  depending on whether project participates in the voluntary incentive program outline in
  Chapter 7 of the DSP. The project is being submitted at 6 stories I 84 ft high with a 4.4 FAR.

        The proposed building has a basic U-shaped footprint, with an east-facing courtyard that
        mirrors and extends the courtyard of the adjacent Orange + Wilson project. As such, the
        building has a six-story presence facing the two streets; however, the courtyard overlooks
        Central Avenue through a two-story high orange portal that punctures the fa<;:ade. The Central
        fa<;:ade is designed as a large single mass or "bar" floating above two-story high storefronts
        and is accented with alternating grey and black projecting balconies, as well as the orange
        portal. The bar is open-ended at the north and south with expansive floor-to-ceiling windows,
        creating a five-story high picture window that echoes a similar design feature on the
        Brand+Wilson project. As the building turns the corner to face Wilson Avenue, the massing is
        broken up by continuous bands and balconies, in addition to various vertical elements that
        compliment similar features on the adjacent Orange+Wilson project.

· Landmark Architectural Features (see DSP Section 4.2.6)- The DSP does not identify this
  location for landmark architectural features, and the proposal accordingly does not include
  any distinctive "iconic" design elements.

· Frontage and Faqade Design (see DSP Section 4.2.8)- Central and Wilson Avenues are
  designated Secondary Frontage Street by the DSP. This designation places an emphasis on
  a quality sidewalk environment for the pedestrian, but is fairly flexible regarding ground level
  uses (in contrast to Primary Frontage Streets, such as Brand Boulevard, which require retail
  or restaurant uses). Consistent with this designation, the building has an almost commercial
  appearance facing Central, with glazed commercial spaces or live-work units fronting the
  sidewalks and a defined "street wall" elevation organized into a strict grid of windows and
  projecting balconies. The Wilson fac;ade, in contrast, is more "residential" in character, with
  the residential lobby and lounges opening to the sidewalk. Above, the fac;ade is more playful
  with an asymmetrical pattern of cantilevered balconies and material finishes, including
  cement fiber board siding.

Building Design and Detailing

· Materials and Colors (see DSP Section 4.2.8)- This building is designed in a similar palette
  of materials, colors and details to the developer's previous two proposals east on Wilson
  Avenue. The exterior finishes are predominately sand-finish plaster and cement siding with
  painted metal railings, dual-pane insulated glass windows and doors at all apartment units,
  single-pane clear storefront with anodized aluminum frames, and brushed aluminum light
  fixtures and signage as accent materials. Whereas the Central Avenue fac;ade is
  predominately plaster with windows and balconies, the other three elevations include cement
  fiber board panels and plaster walls above the aluminum storefront window systems and tile
  cladding along the ground floor level. At the "corner joint" between ground floor
  commercial/live-work unit along Central Avenue and the residential lobby and leasing office
  along Wilson Avenue two portions of the building, the residential lobby is highlighted with a
  tile or stone-veneer finish.

  However, material call-outs are missing on some key details, such as the balconies
  overlooking Central Avenue and the planters at the sidewalk level. To ensure that these
  features will offer a meaningful contrast to the plaster and cement siding, these elements
  should be fabricated from architectural metals, alcuobond panels, burnished block or other
  high-quality materials.

· Lighting and Signs- The package includes lighting plans illustrating various decorative sconces
  and linear light fixtures accenting the building's key architectural features. The proposal
  suggests Central Avenue storefronts will utilize free-standing letters mounted on the long
  marquee canopy that shades the glass; should the ground floor be occupied later with multiple
  tenants, the building may require a sign program.

· Public Art (see DSP Section 5.5)- There is no public art proposed for the project. The
  applicant intends to pay the in-lieu fee equivalent to one percent of the value of the project.

Mobility

· Mobility (see DSP Chapter 6) -The DSP designates Central Avenue as a Vehicular Priority
  Street with primary emphasis on moving automobile traffic to regional freeway networks and
  other communities. The project complies with this requirement in that the driveway entrance


                                                                                              Page 4 of 6

                                                                                                                                                 June 23, 2013

         is located at the farthest point possible away from the Central and Wilson intersection.
         Meanwhile, DSP designates Wilson Avenue as a Pedestrian Priority Street with primary
         emphasis on creating excellent conditions for pedestrians. The arrangement of residential
         lobby, leasing office and amenity rooms facing the Wilson sidewalk promotes this desired
         pedestrian activity, as does the covered plaza where these ground level uses turn the corner
         to the Central Avenue storefronts. The project will also have to comply with the Trip
         Reduction and Tr~vel Demand Measures set out in the Zoning Code (GMC 30.32.171) for
         Tier 1 projects, accommodating a minimum of 1 short-term bicycle parking space per 20 units
         and a minimum of 1 long-term bicycle storage space per 4 units. According to the submitted
         plans, the Project will provide 16 short-term bicycle parking spaces and 40 long-term spaces,
         based on a total of 158 units (including the five live-work units).

Incentives

Incentives for Additional Height and Density (see DSP Chapter 7)- Projects in the Broadway
Center District (Subarea A) may utilize any combination of incentives to increase the permitted
height from 6 stories to 12 stories, and from 3.00 FAR to 5.20 FAR. The project employs the
"Public Open Space" incentive as defined in the DSP, Section 7.2.2 and based on the following:
the project provides 3256 square feet of open space located at the ground level and accessible
to the general public, approximately 1418 square feet in excess of the required 2088 square
feet.

Summary Comments, Recommendations and Draft Record of Decision

The Central+W ilson proposal will be the third in a sequence of transformative buildings on
Wilson Avenue by the same development team. The first and largest project, Brand+Wilson, will
occupy the long-vacant parcel in the middle the Brand Boulevard retail experience, and
appropriately will have the most expressive architectural treatment of the three projects. The
second, Orange +Wilson, is a six-story 166-unit residential-only project, planned for the site
occupied by the recently demolished one-story Joann's House of Fabric building.
Centrai+Wilson completes this lineup and echoes many of the design themes found in the first
two buildings.

The Centrai+Wilson building has a basic U-shaped footprint with an east-facing courtyard,
which mirrors and extends the courtyard of the adjacent Orange+Wilson project. As such , the
building has a six-story presence facing the two streets, although the courtyard overlooks
Central Avenue through a two-story high orange portal that punctures the fac;;ade. The Central
fac;;ade has an almost commercial appearance, designed as a large single mass or "bar" floating
above two-story high storefronts and accented by a strict grid of alternating grey and black
projecting balconies as well as the orange portal. The bar is open-ended at the north and south
with expansive floor-to-ceiling windows , creating a five-story high picture window that echoes a
similar design feature on the Brand+Wilson project. The Wilson fat;ade, in contrast, is more
"residential" in character, with the residential lobby and lounges opening to the sidewalk. Above,
the fat;ade is more playful with an asymmetrical pattern of cantilevered balconies and material
finishes, including cement fiber board siding elements that compliment similar features on the
adjacent Orange+Wilson project.

Together, the three +Wilson projects, along with the proposed 172-room Marriott Courtyard
Hotel directly north of the site, will dramatically change the look and functionality of Wilson
Avenue. These projects will bring improved and wider sidewalks, new storefronts uses and
additional population to Wilson, making it the primary pedestrian connections between Brand
Boulevard and Central Avenue and one of the more significant streets in the Downtown.

The project is consistent with the Downtown Specific Plan standards and guidelines, and
identical to the well-developed Stage I design unanimously approved on March 5, 2013.
Approval of the Stage II design is recommended with the following conditions:

1) Balconies overlooking Central Avenue shall be fabricated from architectural metal,
   alucobond, cement panels or a similarly high-quality material as approved by the Principal
   Urban Designer.

2) Planters along the sidewalk shall be clad in architectural metal, tilework, burnished block,
   finished concrete or a similarly high-quality material as approved by the Principal Urban
   Designer.

                                   DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

        This Development Agreement ("Agreement") is made in Los Angeles County, California
as of                20 13, by and between the CITY OF GLENDALE, a municipal corporation
and charter city (the "City"), and GFC Glendale Associates, LLC, a California Limited Liability
Company ("Developer"). Together, the City and the Developer shall be referred to as the
"Parties."

       1.       Recitals. This Agreement is made with respect to the following facts and for the
following purposes, each of which is acknowledged as true and correct by the Parties and each of
which is fully incorporated and made part of the Agreement:

       (a)    The City is authorized, pursuant to Govenunent Code §§65864 through 65869.5
("Development Agreement Statutes"), and under its authority as a charter city to enter into
binding agreements with persons or entities having legal or equitable interests in real property for
the development of such property in order to establish certainty in the development process;

        (b)    Developer is the cunent ovmer of real property, consisting of an approximate
41,746 square foot project site (including a vacated adjacent alley), located at 130 North Central
Avenue, and surrounded by North Central Avenue to the west, 225 West Broadway, 200 West
Wilson Avenue to the east, and West Wilson Avenue to the north, in the City of Glendale (the
"Property"). The Property is depicted in Exhibit A ("Project Site") and legally defined in Exhibit
B ("Legal Description"), both of which are attached hereto and incorporated by reference.
Developer and City acknowledge and agree that Developer is in the process of selling the
Property to HPG Central+ Wilson, LLC, a Washington limited liability corporation (''HPG''),
and that Developer intends on assigning this Agreement in its entirety to HPG upon notice to
City as Close of Escrow as defined in Section 2 herein below. Developer has authorized HPG to
seek entitlements for the Property. City and Developer agree that should the escrow on the
conveyance of the Property to HPG fail to close, then this Agreement shall be automatically
terminated and of no further force and effect, and City shall cooperate in removing this
Agreement from title to the Property.

        (c)     On                , Developer received approval from the City to construct a 6-
story, 85 foot high mixed-use residential conunercial project consisting of 153 multi-family
rental units and approximately 4,900 square feet of ground floor commercial space [or five (5)
live-work units] and related amenities with underground and above grade on-site parking (the
"Project"), commonly referred to as "Central+ Wilson."

       (d)     The Project is located in the "Broadway Center" District, Subarea A of the
Downtown Specific Plan ("DSP"). The DSP encourages certain uses or development types by
providing additional stories, height and density for such uses. In exchange for providing
additional publically accessible open space the DSP allows an increase in density from 3.0 to 5.2
FAR in the Broadway Center District. The Project's approved design incorporates an additional


                                                  2

1,300 square feet of publically accessible open space over the minimum 2,087 square feet
required for this Project in order to qualify for the DSP Open Space Incentive, in this case an
increase in FAR from 3.0 to 4.4 FAR.

        (e)     DSP Chapter 7, "Incentives and Bonuses" requires applicants using the bonuses
and/or incentives to enter into either a statutory development agreement or a covenant with the
City in order to ensure the City receives the benefit of the chosen incentive. Developer has
chosen to enter into tllis Agreement to comply with the DSP requirements in order to use the
Public Open Space Incentive for the Project.

       (f)     Developer has also sought to enter into this Agreement to preserve Land Use
Entitlements, as defined in Section 2 herein below, for a fourteen (14) year period.

        (g)     Pursuant to Government Code §65867.5, the City Council of the City of Glendale
("City Council") finds that: (1) this Agreement, the Applicable Rules and any Future Approvals
(as defined herein) ofthe Project implement the goals and policies of the City of Glendale's

to the public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the City and the surrounding

Agreement is being entered into pursuant to and in compliance with the requirements of
Government Code §65867;

        (h)  Significant public benefits will be provided by Developer and the Project to the
entire community, including but not limited to the following direct and indirect public benefits:

                 (1)     Payment ofthe first half of the Parks and Library Development Impact

In order to effectuate the provisions of this Agreement, and in consideration for the Parties
entering this Agreement and obligating themselves to cany out the covenants and conditions set
forth in the preceding Section of this Agreement, the Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that:

                 (a)      Agreement and Assurances on the Part of Developer.

                         (1)     Developer agrees to use good faith efforts to submit plans for Plan
                 Check and pay Plan Check fees pursuant to the Land Use Entitlements within four
                 (4) years of Tenant's vacation of the Property. Developer's failure to submit
                 plans for Plan Check and pay Plan Check fees pursuant to the Land Use
                 Entitlements within the four (4) year period specified in this Section 8(a)(t) shall
                 result in termination of this Agreement. Provided, however, that nothing in this
                 Agreement shall obligate Developer to develop, construct or operate the Project
                 if, in Developer's reasonable business judgment, it is not feasible to do so.

                         (2)     In connection with the construction of the Project Developer shall
                 comply with all Applicable Rules, including without limitation any Mitigation
                 Measures and Conditions of Approval. Developer agrees that the City has
                 sufficient legal authority to adopt and require Developer's compliance with the
                 Mitigation Measures and Conditions of Approval, and Developer agrees that it
                 will not challenge the City's right to require Developer's compliance with the
                 Mitigation Measures and Conditions of Approval.


                 (b)    Administrative Changes and Amendments. Notwithstanding Section
l l(g) hereof, the Parties acknowledge that further planning and development of the Project may
demonstrate that refinements and changes are appropriate with respect to the details and
performance of the Pmties under this Agreement. The Parties desire to retain a certain degree of
flexibility with respect to the details of the Project development and with respect to those items
covered in general terms under this Agreement. If and when the parties mutually agree that
"Minor Changes", as herein defined, are necessary or appropriate, they may, unless otherwise
required by law, be effectuated through administrative amendments executed by the Developer
and the City Manager or his or her designee, pursuant to the processes established through the


                                                  10

modifications or adjustments, which are consistent with the Applicable Rules, and which do not
materially alter the overall nature, scope, or design of the Project, including, without limitation,
minor changes in locations of the building, or streets, infrastructure, the configuration and size of
the parcel or lot (including lot line adjustments), or development of the infrastructure. Minor
Changes to the design shall substantially comply with the Design Review Approval, and unless
the parties otherwise agree, any proposed modifications to design shall only require materials
that are substantially the same or comparable to the materials approved in the Design Review
Approval. Minor Changes shall not be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement under
Section ll{g) of this Agreement or under Government Code Section 65868, and unless otherwise
required by law, no such administrative amendments shall require prior notice or hearing by the
Planning Commission or City Council.

Developer or Developer's ownership, development, use, or operation of the Project Site or any
portion thereof excepting those liabilities which are caused by the Indemnitees' (or any of them)

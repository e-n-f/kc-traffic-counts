       Along the streetside multi-use trail system, a minimum number of 5 seating areas will be
       provided within abutting common area accessible to the trail.

Neighborhood Meeting:
The applicant conducted a neighborhood meeting on September 30, 2013. The report is attached.

2030 LAND USE MAP:
The 2030 Land Use Map identifies the proposed site for Rural Density and Low Density Residential.
The applicant is requesting an amendment to the 2030 Land Use Map to Low Density Residential with
the PUD condition that the overall density is not to exceed 1.5 units an acre.

APEX TRANSPORTATION PLAN:
The proposed PUD is consistent with the Apex Transportation Plan and the proposed Apex
Transportation Plan amendment to add a major collector road connecting across the subject property
from Horton Road to the eastern property boundary; future development would be required to
extend the road from the subject property to New Hill Olive Chapel Road.

ACCESS AND CIRCULATION:
Apex staff concurs with the applicant providing a major collector road connecting to Horton Road and
stubbing to the eastern property boundary in addition to providing the primary site access on Old US 1 to
allow up to 440 single family homes. Staff recommends future completion of the major collector street
to New Hill Olive Chapel Road by others as part of off site development yet to be determined.

Apex staff concur with all the recommendations in the Traffic Impact Analysis and those are included in
the Jordan Pointe PD Plan:
a. 75-foot westbound right turn lane on Old US 1 at Horton Road
b. Traffic signal for the intersection of Old US 1 at New Hill Olive Chapel Road/New Hill Holleman Road
c. 50-foot eastbound left turn lane & 125-foot westbound right turn lane for the site driveway at Old US 1


                                                                     Prepared by: Lauren Simmons, Planner II

STAFF REPORT
Jordan Pointe PUD-#13CZ30 and 2030 Land Use Map Amendment
March 18, 2014 Town Council Meeting


See the attached full summary from Traffic Engineer Russell Dalton, PE.

UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE:
The proposed Jordan Pointe PD Plan is in compliance with the standards provided in the UDO.

PARKS, RECREATION AND CULTURAL RESOURCES ADVISORY COMMISSION:
The Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Advisory Commission reviewed this project on October
30, 2013 and recommended the following:

Fee: $1,381, 591.20 (440X $3,139.98)
Land: 14.46 acres

 "The first preference of the Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Resources Advisory Commission is that
 the developers of Jordan Pointe pursue a partnership with other developers in the area that will
 result in a regional park facility consistent with the Town's Parks Recreation, Greenways, and Open
 Space Master Plan. In the event that such a regional facility/ partnership is not accomplished to the
 Town's satisfaction by the time the first plat is submitted for Jordan Pointe, the developer shall be
 required to pay a fee in lieu for the project with the caveat that the Town and developer could elect
 to continue seeking a regional park facility at their discretion if sufficient progress is being made
 towards land acquisition".

STAFF RECOMMENDATION:
Staff is not opposed to the applicant's request to amend the 2030 Land Use Map from Rural Density
Residential to Low Density Residential given the PUD-CZ zoning condition limiting density to 1.5 units
per acre. If the 2030 Land Use Map amendment is approved by Town Council, Staff recommends
approval of the Jordan Pointe PD Plan, rezoning #13CZ30 with the conditions as agreed to by the
applicant.

PLANNING BOARD RECOMMENDATION:
The Planning Board heard this at their March 10, 2014 meeting and unanimously recommended
approval of the 2030 Land Use Map Amendment and rezone #13CZ30.

ANALYSIS STATEMENT OF THE REASONABLENESS OF THE PROPOSED REZONING:
This proposed rezoning of PUD-CZ is in keeping with the low density and residential nature of the area
and increased demand for housing in Apex.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT AND CONDITIONAL ZONING STANDARDS:
The Town Council shall find the PUD-CZ designation demonstrates compliance with the following standards.
2.3.3 (F)(1):



                                                                        Prepared by: Lauren Simmons, Planner II

Jordan Pointe PUD-#13CZ30 and 2030 Land Use Map Amendment
March 18, 2014 Town Council Meeting


  Standards
  In return for greater flexibility in site design requirements, Planned Developments (PD) Districts are
  expected to deliver exceptional quality community designs that preserve critical environmental resources;
  provide high quality community amenities; incorporate creative design in the layout of buildings, Resource
  Conservation Area and circulation; ensure compatibility with surrounding land uses and neighborhood
  character; provide high quality architecture; and provide greater efficiency in the layout and provision of
  roads, utilities, and other infrastructure. The Planned Development (PD) Districts shall not be used as a
  means of circumventing the Town's adopted land development regulations for routine developments.

   1) Planned Unit Development (PUD-CZ) District
   In approving a Planned Development (PD) Zoning District designation for a PUD-CZ, the Town Council shall
   find the PUD-CZ district designation and PD Plan for PUD-CZ demonstrates compliance with the following
   standards:

         a)    Development parameters
               (i)    The uses proposed to be developed in the PD Plan for PUD-CZ are those uses permitted
                      in Sec. 4.2.2, Use Table.

               (ii)    The uses proposed in the PD Plan for PUD-CZ can be entirely residential, entirely non-
                       residential, or a mix of residential and non-residential uses. The location of uses
                       proposed by the PUD-CZ must be shown in the PD Plan with a maximum density for
                       each type of residential use and a maximum square footage for each type of non-
                       residential use.

               (iii)   The dimensional standards in Sec. 5.1.3, Table of Intensity and Dimensional Standards,
                       Planned Development Districts may be varied in the PD Plan for PUD-CZ. In no case
                       shall the minimum side setback for single-family and modular residential be less than
                       five (5) feet. The PUD-CZ shall demonstrate compliance with all other dimensional
                       standards of the UDO, North Carolina Building Code, and North Carolina Fire Code.

               (iv)    The development proposed in the PD Plan for PUD-CZ encourages cluster and compact
                       development to the greatest extent possible that is interrelated and linked by
                       pedestrian ways, bikeways and other transportation systems. At a minimum, the PD
                       Plan must show sidewalk improvements as required by the Apex Transportation Plan
                       and the Town of Apex Standard Specifications and Standard Details, and greenway
                       improvements as required by the Town of Apex Parks, Recreation, Greenways, and
                       Open Space Plan and the Apex Transportation Plan.

               (v)     The design of development in the PD Plan for PUD-CZ results in land use patterns that
                       promote and expand opportunities for walkability, connectivity, public transportation,
                       and an efficient compact network of streets. Cul-de-sacs shall be avoided unless the
                       design of the subdivision and the existing or proposed street system in the surrounding
                       area indicate that a through street is not essential in the location of the proposed cul-
                       de-sac, or where sensitive environmental areas such as streams, floodplains, and

                                                                          Prepared by: Lauren Simmons, Planner II

                       wetlands would be substantially disturbed by making road connections.

               (vi)    The development proposed in the PD Plan for PUD-CZ is compatible with the character
                       of surrounding land uses and maintains and enhances the value of surrounding
                       properties.

         b)    Off-street parking and loading. The PD Plan for PUD-CZ shall demonstrate compliance with the
               standards of Sec. 8.3, Off-Street Parking and Loading, except that variations from these
               standards may be permitted if a comprehensive parking and loading plan for the PUD-CZ is
               submitted as part of the PD Plan that is determined to be suitable for the PUD-CZ, and generally
               consistent with the intent and purpose of the off-street parking and loading standards.

         c)    RCA. The PD Plan for PUD-CZ shall demonstrate compliance with Sec. 8.1.2, Resource
               Conservation Area, except that the percentage of RCA required under Sec. 8.1.2 may be
               reduced by the Town Council by no more than two (2%) percent.

         d)    Landscaping. The PD Plan for PUD-CZ shall demonstrate compliance with the standards of Sec.
               8.2, Landscaping, Buffering and Screening, except that variations from these standards may be
               permitted where it is demonstrated that the proposed landscaping sufficiently buffers uses
               from each other, ensures compatibility with land uses on surrounding properties, creates
               attractive streetscapes and parking areas and is consistent with the character of the area. In no
               case shall a buffer be less than one half of the width required by Sec. 8.2 or ten (10) feet in
               width, whichever is greater.

         e)    Signs. Signage in the PD Plan for PUD-CZ shall demonstrate compliance with Sec. 8.7, Signs,
               except that the standards can be varied as follows if a master signage plan is submitted for
               review and approval concurrent with the PD plan:

                      The square footage of all permitted permanent ground and wall signage shall be allowed
                      to be increased by ten (10%) percent of the calculated allowable square footage.

                      The names of up to two (2) tenants are allowed per ground sign provided that the name
                      of the overall development is listed first and is a minimum of fifty (50%) percent larger
                      than the tenant name(s).

         f)    Public facilities. The improvements standards and guarantees applicable to the public facilities
               that will serve the site shall comply with Article 7: Subdivision.

               (i)     The PD Plan for PUD-CZ demonstrates a safe and adequate on-site transportation
                       circulation system. The on-site transportation circulation system shall be integrated
                       with the off-site transportation circulation system of the Town. The PD Plan for PUD-CZ
                       shall be consistent with the Apex Transportation Plan and the Town of Apex Standard
                       Specifications and Standard Details and show required right-of-way widths and road
                       sections. A Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) shall be required per Sec. 13.19.

                                                                           Prepared by: Lauren Simmons, Planner II

                       water and wastewater lines that can accommodate the proposed development, and
                       are efficiently integrated into off-site potable water and wastewater public
                       improvement plans. The PD Plan shall include a proposed water and wastewater plan.

March 18, 2014 Town Council Meeting


        Legislative Considerations
        The applicant shall propose site-specific standards and conditions that take into account the following
        considerations, which are considerations that are relevant to the legislative determination of whether
        or not the proposed conditional zoning district rezoning request is in the public interest. These
        considerations do not exclude the legislative consideration of any other factor that is relevant to the
        public interest.
        1) Consistency with 2030 Land Use Map. The proposed Conditional Zoning (CZ) District use's
        appropriateness for its proposed location and consistency with the purposes, goals, objectives, and
        policies of the 2030 Land Use Map.
        2) Compatibility. The proposed Conditional Zoning (CZ) District use's appropriateness for its proposed

              10/2/13

Mr. Horn:

Please review the following comments and recommendations. You may schedule a
meeting with me and your client to discuss at your convenience.

Study Area

       The subdivision is located on the north side of Old US 1 between New Hill Olive
       Chapel Road and Horton Road with frontage on Old US 1 and on Horton Road.
       The study includes the stop controlled intersections of Old US 1 at Horton Road
       and Old US 1 at New Hill Olive Chapel Road/New Hill Holleman Road.

Trip Generation and Distribution

The TIA assumes 440 single family homes and is anticipated to generate 80 inbound
trips and 238 outbound trips in the a.m. peak hour, 251 inbound trips and 148 outbound
trips in the p.m. peak hour, and 4,104 trips on a typical weekday. The distribution is as
follows:

       48% of trips to/from the south on New Hill Holleman Road (interchange at US 1)
       30% to/from the east on Old US 1 (interchange at NC 540)
       20% to/from the north on New Hill Olive Chapel Road with primary intersections at
       Olive Chapel Road and at US 64/NC 751
       2% to/from the west on Old US 1
Site Access (includes review of layout plan)

       There is one point of access along Old US 1 proposed 0.27 miles east of Horton
       Road.
       There are two points of access proposed along Horton Road, one located 0.34
       miles north of Old US 1 and the second one located 0.44 miles further north. All
       three points are proposed as full movement.

Traffic Capacity Analysis

       The Horton Road approach to Old US 1 is anticipated to operate with short delays for
       build-out in 2016.
       The approaches of New Hill Olive Chapel Road and New Hill Holleman Road are
       anticipated to operate with long delays under stop control but the intersection is
       anticipated to operate at LOS B with a traffic signal in the peak hours for build-out in
       2016.
       All proposed points of access for the site are anticipated to operate with short delays.


Recommendations

   1. The TIA recommends a 75 foot westbound right turn lane on Old US 1 at Horton
       Road. Apex staff concurs with the recommendation.

   2. The TIA recommends a traffic signal for the intersection of Old US 1 at New Hill
       Olive Chapel Road/New Hill Holleman Road. Apex staff concurs with the
       recommendation.

   3. The TIA recommends a 50 foot eastbound left turn lane and 125 foot westbound
      right turn lane for the site driveway at Old US 1. Apex staff concurs with the
      recommendations.

   4. The TIA recommends no exclusive turning lanes for the site driveways along
      Horton Road. Apex staff concurs with the recommendation.

   5. The PUD plan and TIA propose the aforementioned points of access for up to 440
      single family homes. Apex staff recommend that the site be limited to 300
      dwelling units until a second point of access along a dedicated public route is
      provided to New Hill Olive Chapel Road.




                                                                                                  2
NCDOT maintains Old US 1, Horton Road, New Hill Olive Chapel Road, and New Hill
Holleman Road. I welcome the opportunity to discuss any recommendations pertaining
to state-maintained roads and encourage discussions with NCDOT as early as possible
prior to review by Town Council.

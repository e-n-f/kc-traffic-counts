                                              Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. (VHB) has completed a detailed Traffic Impact and
                                              Access Study to evaluate the traffic impacts associated with the development of a
                                              proposed Cumberland Farms Convenience Store with Gasoline Sales on an
                                              approximate 1.17 acre site. The site is located on the southwest corner of the
                                              intersection of Southampton Road (Route 10/202) at North Road (Route 202) in the
                                              City of Westfield, Massachusetts. The site location can be seen on Figure 1. The site
                                              is currently zoned Commercial.

                                              VHB has evaluated existing traffic operations in the area, assessed the impacts of this
                                              development, and identified transportation improvements necessary to
                                              accommodate this redevelopment and potential traffic growth in this area.




Project Description
                                              The project site is currently undeveloped, and is primarily wooded. The proposed
                                              project consists of a Cumberland Farms convenience store and fueling facility with 5
                                              gasoline pumps (10 vehicle fueling positions) as well as a convenience store. The
                                              proposed Cumberland Farms convenience store is approximately 4,513 ± square feet.

                                              Access to the site will be provided via three access points; a full-access driveway and
                                              an entrance-only driveway located off Southampton Road (approximately 225 feet
                                              and 50 feet south of the intersection with North Road, respectively), and one full-
                                              access driveway located off North Road (approximately 115 feet west of the
                                              intersection with Southampton Road).




Study Methodology
                                              This traffic assessment has been conducted in the following manner. First, VHB
                                              assessed the existing traffic conditions within the project area including an inventory
                                              of existing roadway geometry, observations of traffic flow, peak period traffic
                                              counts, and a review of traffic safety in the area.

                                              Then, the framework for evaluating the transportation impacts of the proposed
                                              project was established. Specific travel demand forecasts for the project were
                                              assessed along with future traffic demands on the study area roadways due to
                                              projected background traffic growth and other proposed area development that will
                                              occur independent of the proposed development. This traffic impact and access
                                              study has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines for traffic impact analysis
                                              set forth by the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EOEEA),
                                              Executive Office of Transportation and Public Works (EOTPW) and the
                                              Massachusetts Highway Department (MassDOT). In accordance with these
                                              guidelines, the year 2018 (a five-year time horizon), was selected as the design year
                                              for analysis. The traffic analysis conducted identified both existing and projected
                                              future roadway capacities and demands.

                                              study area. Existing transportation conditions in the study area include roadway
                                              geometry, traffic controls, traffic flow, and traffic safety data. Each of these elements
                                              is described in detail below.



Study Area
                                              To effectively evaluate the transportation impacts associated with the proposed
                                              development, it is necessary to review the existing roadway system in the vicinity of
                                              the site. The study area for this analysis includes the following intersection:

                                                              ¾ Southampton Road (Route 10/202) at North Road (signalized);


                                              The existing conditions analysis consisted of an inventory of the traffic controls,
                                              roadway, driveway and intersection geometrics in the study area, the collection of
                                              peak hour traffic volumes, and a review of recent crash history.

                                              two travel lanes (1 lane per direction) with exclusive turning lanes at key
                                              intersections and wide shoulders. In front of the site the pavement width varies
                                              between 45 feet and 50 feet, carrying one travel lane in each direction. The posted
                                              speed limit along Southampton Road is 40 mph in the vicinity of the site. No
                                              sidewalks or pedestrian accommodations are provided along this section of
                                              Southampton Road. The abutting land uses along Southampton Road are a mix of
                                              commercial, institutional, and residential, as well as several large distribution
                                              facilities. Barnes Air National Guard Base is located off the opposite side of
                                              Southampton Road, in the vicinity of the site.



North Road (Route 202)

                                              North Road (Route 202) is an east-west roadway providing connection to Interstate
                                              91 to the east. North Road is a minor collector roadway. North Road to the east of
                                              Southampton Road is designated as Route 202, while North Road to the west of
                                              Southampton Road does not carry a designation. North Road has a cross section
                                              consisting of two travel lanes (1 per direction), without shoulders adjacent to the site.
                                              The pavement width is approximately 30 feet in the vicinity of the project site. The
                                              abutting land use along North Road in the study area is predominantly residential,
                                              minor commercial and institutional. The posted speed limit is 40 mph in the vicinity
                                              of the site. No sidewalks or pedestrian accommodations are provided along North
                                              Road.



Intersections



Southampton Road (Rte 10 & 202) at North Road (Rte 202)

                                              North Road intersects Southampton Road from the east and west to form this four-
                                              way signalized intersection. The North Road eastbound and westbound approaches
                                              both consist of a single multi-purpose lane, however, vehicles were observed
                                              forming multiple lanes along the westbound approach. The northbound and
                                              southbound Southampton Road approaches each provide a single multi-purpose
                                              lane, however, vehicles were observed forming multiple lanes along the both of these
                                              approaches as well. The project site is located on the southwest corner of the
                                              intersection. Land uses in the vicinity of the intersection consist of a residential
                                              home on the northeast corner, 7B's Grill and Bar, a convenience store, a hair salon,
                                              and a drive-through ATM on the northwest corner, and wooded area and a large
                                              distribution center on the southeast corner. Movements at the intersection are
                                              controlled by a 2-phase actuated-uncoordinated traffic signal.

Traffic Volumes
                                              Peak hour turning movement and classification (TMC) counts were collected on a
                                              typical weekday evening from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM and on a typical Saturday from
                                              11:00 AM to 1:00 PM at the study area intersection on January 24, 2013 (Thursday)
                                              and January 26, 2013 (Saturday).

                                              Based on the TMC data, the peak hours of traffic operations for the study area
                                              intersections were determined to be 4:15 PM to 5:15 PM on a typical weekday
                                              evening, and 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM on a typical Saturday midday.

                                              Automatic traffic recorder counts were also conducted January 25th through January
                                              26th, 2013 along Southampton Road in front of the project site. Table 1 summarizes

Seasonal Adjustment
                                              The traffic volume data collected for this project were obtained during the month of
                                              January. To quantify the seasonal variation of traffic volumes in the area, historic
                                              traffic data available from MassDOT were reviewed. This data indicates that traffic
                                              volumes in January are typically lower than the yearly average conditions.
                                              Therefore, a seasonal adjustment of 1.02% was applied to the traffic volumes in order
                                              to provide a conservative analysis. Figure 2 illustrates the resulting 2013 Existing

Crash History
                                              To identify accident trends and/or roadway deficiencies in the study area, crash data
                                              for the study area intersections were obtained from MassDOT for the most recently
                                              available three-year period (2008-2010). MassDOT reports vehicle crashes with
                                              damage greater than $1,000 or personal injury occurrences, which can give a good
                                              indication of safety along the study corridor.

                                              The 2011 MassDOT average crash rates for signalized intersections for District 2 (the
                                              MassDOT district designation for Westfield) is 0.82. As seen in the crash summary
                                              table found in the Appendix, the signalized intersection of Southampton Road
                                              (Route 10/202) at North Road (Route 202) is above the MassDOT District 2 average
                                              crash rate values, with a value of 1.14.

                                              In that report, the signalized intersection experienced a total of twenty two (22)
                                              reported accidents over the three year period. The majority of the reported accidents
                                              were angle and rear-end accidents.

                                              To determine future demands on the roadway network, existing traffic volumes in
                                              the study area were projected to the year 2018, reflecting a five year traffic-planning
                                              horizon. Traffic volumes on the roadway network under future conditions without
                                              the project (2018 No-Build) are assumed to include all existing traffic, any new traffic
                                              due to background traffic growth, and traffic related to any specific development
                                              projects expected to be completed by the horizon year. Anticipated traffic volumes
                                              from the proposed development were added to the No-Build traffic volumes to
                                              reflect conditions with the project in place (2018 Build scenario).



Background Traffic Growth
                                              Traffic growth on area roadways is a function of the expected land development,
                                              economic activity, and changes in demographics. Several methods can be used to
                                              estimate this growth. A procedure frequently employed is to estimate an annual
                                              percentage increase and apply that increase to study area traffic volumes. An
                                              alternative procedure is to identify estimated traffic generated by planned new major
                                              developments that would be expected to impact the project study area roadways.
                                              For the purpose of this assessment, both methods were utilized.


Historic Traffic Growth
                                              Many factors influence regional traffic growth including socio-economic factors such
                                              as population, employment, regional development, and dwelling unit changes. For
                                              the purpose of this study, an annual growth rate of 2-percent per year was applied to
                                              the existing traffic volumes over the 5-year forecast period. Regional traffic growth is
                                              projected by examining historical traffic volumes and other more recent traffic
                                              studies conducted within the area. The existing traffic volumes were grown by
                                              2-percent per year to account for potential future traffic growth.

Site-Specific Growth
                                              Traffic volumes in the area can be affected by other nearby developments. Based on
                                              information provided by the City of Westfield it was identified that while
                                              development opportunities currently exist within the City, they are either located too
                                              far from the study area to have a significant impact, or official applications have not
                                              been filed with the City yet.

                                              One development that has been approved by the City but has been completely
                                              constructed is the Armbrook Senior Living Center, proposed to be located further
                                              west along North Road and provide 122 living units. Construction is currently
                                              underway, with occupancy set for the spring of 2013. Since these types of
                                              developments generate minimal traffic, it can be assumed that the traffic increase is
                                              accounted for as part of the conservative 2 percent per year background growth.

                                              It was assumed that the site specific growth associated with any other potential
                                              developments can also be accounted for as part of the historic 2 percent per year
                                              background growth. The 2018 No-Build traffic volumes are shown on Figure 3.



Future Roadway Conditions
                                              In assessing future traffic conditions, proposed roadway improvements within the
                                              study area were considered. Based on discussions with the City of Westfield, there
                                              are currently no improvement plans that would alter the roadway cross section or
                                              characteristics. One project that is currently planned is the construction of a new
                                              water and/or sewer main, but this project is not expected to impact traffic volumes
                                              or patterns in the vicinity of the site.


Trip Generation
                                              To estimate the trip-generating characteristics for the proposed development, traffic
                                              projections were derived from trip generation rates published by the Institute of
                                              Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation1 For the proposed gas station with
                                              convenience store, it was determined that ITE trip generation rates for gas/service
                                              station with convenience store (land use code 945) were the most appropriate rates to
                                              use. Saturday daily trips were estimated using a ratio of Saturday daily to Saturday
                                              midday peak hour estimates for LUC 820 (Shopping Center) for a corresponding
                                              square footage with trip generation similar to the Saturday midday peak hour. As
                                              noted earlier, the proposed gas station will consist of 10 vehicle fueling positions.
                                              A summary of the Cumberland Farms convenience store and fueling facility trip
                                              generation is detailed in Table 2.

                                              In addition, not all of the net new traffic generated by the site will be new traffic on
                                              the study area roadways. Given the nature of a fueling facility, the demand is
                                              generally a function of the adjacent street traffic volumes, and typically consists of
                                              primarily drive-by traffic. Drive-by traffic is defined as vehicles already on the
                                              roadway network who decide to stop at the fueling facility prior to proceeding to
                                              their original destination. ITE data suggests that approximately 62 percent of the
                                              traffic generated by a gas station with convenience store could be pass-by traffic.
                                              However, to be consistent with EOEA/EOT Guidelines for Traffic Impact
                                              Assessments and to provide a conservative analysis, only 25 percent of the traffic
                                              generated by the site was assumed to be pass-by trips. The resulting trip generation
                                              is presented in Table 2.

                                              As shown in Table 2, the site is not expected to generate a significant amount of trips

Trip Distribution and Assignment
                                              The regional trip distribution of site generated traffic due to the proposed development
                                              is expected to reflect the vehicle patterns of existing vehicle trips accessing the site.
                                              Table 3 illustrates the trip distribution along the study area approaches.

                                              As illustrated in Table 3, the majority of site generated traffic is expected to approach
                                              the site from the south on Southampton Road (Route 10/202). This accounts for
                                              approximately 42 percent and 39 percent of the peak hour traffic during the weekday
                                              evening and Saturday midday peak hours, respectively. Using these assumptions
                                              and the distribution of traffic to/from the site; traffic was assigned to the driveways.

                                              By using the existing traffic volumes, the anticipated Trip Generation Increase
                                              numbers from Table 2, and the trip distribution percentages, the anticipated increase
                                              in traffic volumes along each leg of the surrounding roadway network can be
                                              estimated. For example, on a daily basis, Southampton Road (Route 10/202) carries
                                              approximately 12,500 vehicles per day south of North Road. The trip distribution
                                              exercise that was done shows that approximately 42% of site traffic comes from and
                                              returns to the south along Southampton Road during the weekday evening peak
                                              hour. The total estimated daily increase in traffic volumes is 1,220 as shown in Table
                                              2. From this information, it can be calculated that Southampton Road is estimated to
                                              carry approximately 510 (42% of 1,220 total vehicles per day) more vehicles per day,
                                              representing only a 4% increase over existing conditions.

                                              During the weekday evening peak hour, Southampton Road (Route 10/202) south of
                                              North Road currently carries 1,090 vehicles per hour (approximately 18 vehicles
                                              every minute). The total trips during the weekday evening peak hour that this site is
                                              proposed to generate is approximately 100 trips per hour (from Table 2). Of the 100
                                              new trips per hour, approximately 42 (42% of 100) will travel along Southampton
                                              Road (Route 10/202) south of North Road, which represents a minimal increase of
                                              less than 1 new vehicle per minute.

Site Driveways and Circulation
                                              As currently proposed, the Cumberland Farms convenience store and fueling facility
                                              will be adequately served by three site driveways, one full access driveway on
                                              Southampton Road (Route 10/202) and one full access driveway on North Road, as
                                              well as an entrance only driveway along Southampton Road located closer to the
                                              signalized intersection of Southampton Road (Route 10/202) at North Road (Route
                                              202). The two new full-access driveways will be located further away from the
                                              signalized intersection to help avoid conflicts with traffic at the intersection.

                                              The proposed West Site Driveway intersects North Road from the south to form an
                                              unsignalized intersection. North Road is proposed to continue operating freely,
                                              while the site driveway approach is to operate under "STOP" control. The driveway
                                              approach will provide a shared right/left turn lane. The proposed site driveway is
                                              located approximately 115 feet west of the signalized intersection.

                                              The proposed South Site Driveway intersects Southampton Road (Route 10/202) from
                                              the west and forms a three-legged unsignalized intersection. Southampton Road is
                                              proposed to continue operating freely, while the site driveway approach is to operate
                                              under "STOP" control. The driveway approach will provide a shared right/left turn
                                              lane. This proposed site driveway is located approximately 225 feet south of the
                                              signalized intersection.

                                              The proposed North Site Driveway intersects Southampton Road (Route 10/202) from
                                              the west and forms a three-legged unsignalized intersection. Southampton Road is
                                              proposed to continue operating freely, while the site driveway is an entrance only
                                              driveway, not allowing vehicles to exit. This proposed site driveway is located
                                              approximately 50 feet south of the signalized intersection.

                                              The location of the site driveways allow for full use of the site from a vehicle
                                              circulation perspective. At fueling facilities it is ideal to allow multiple access and
                                              egress points so that traffic does not become congested on site. If vehicles are
                                              allowed to access the site and pull into a site driveway without conflict, it minimizes
                                              the chances of impacting the adjacent roadways.


Build Traffic Volumes
                                              Design year 2018 Build traffic volumes for study area roadways were determined by
                                              estimating site-generated traffic volumes and distributing these volumes over the
                                              study area roadways. These site-generated volumes were added to the 2018
                                              No-Build traffic volumes to create the year 2018 Build traffic volume networks. The
                                              2018 Build weekday evening and Saturday midday peak hour traffic volumes are
                                              illustrated on Figures 4 and 5, respectively.

                                              Measuring existing traffic volumes and projecting future traffic volumes quantifies
                                              traffic flow within the study area. To assess quality of flow, roadway capacity
                                              analyses were conducted with respect to Existing, projected No-Build, and Build
                                              traffic volume conditions. Capacity analyses provide an indication of how well the
                                              roadway facilities serve the traffic demands placed upon them. Roadway operating
                                              conditions are classified by calculated levels of service.



Level-Of-Service Criteria
                                              The evaluation criteria used to analyze area intersections in this traffic study are
                                              based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)2. The term `Level of service'
                                              (LOS) is used to denote the different operating conditions that occur on a given
                                              roadway segment under various traffic volume loads. It is a qualitative measure that
                                              considers a number of factors including roadway geometry, speed, travel delay and
                                              freedom to maneuver. Level of service provides an index to the operational qualities
                                              of a roadway segment or an intersection. Level-of-service designations range from A
                                              to F, with LOS A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F representing
                                              the worst operating conditions.

                                              In addition to LOS, two other measures of effectiveness (MOEs) are typically used to
                                              quantify the traffic operations at intersections; volume-to-capacity ratio (v/c) and
                                              delay (expressed in seconds per vehicle). For example, an existing v/c ratio of 0.9 for
                                              an intersection indicates that the intersection is operating at 90 percent of its
                                              available capacity. A delay of 15 seconds for a particular vehicular movement or
                                              approach indicates that vehicles on the movement or approach will experience an
                                              average additional travel time of 15 seconds. It should be noted that v/c and delay
                                              could have a range of values for a given LOS letter designation. Comparison of
                                              intersection capacity results therefore requires that, in addition to the LOS, the other
                                              MOEs should also be considered.

                                              The level-of-service designations, which are based on delay, are reported differently
                                              for signalized and unsignalized intersections. For signalized intersections, the
                                              analysis considers the operation of all traffic entering the intersection and the

                                              LOS designation is for overall conditions at the intersection. For unsignalized
                                              intersections, however, the analysis assumes that traffic on the mainline is not
                                              affected by traffic on the side streets. Thus, the LOS designation is for the critical
                                              movement exiting the side street, which is generally the left turn out of the side street
                                              or site driveway. Table 4 shows the level of service criteria for both signalized
                                              intersections and unsignalized intersections.

                                              It should be noted that the analytical methodologies typically used for the analysis of
                                              unsignalized intersections use conservative analysis parameters, such as long critical
                                              gaps. Actual field observations indicate that drivers on minor streets generally
                                              accept shorter gaps in traffic than those used in the analysis procedures and
                                              therefore experience less delay than reported by the analysis software. The analysis
                                              methodologies also do not fully take into account the beneficial grouping effects
                                              caused by nearby signalized intersections. The net effect of these analysis
                                              procedures is the over-estimation of calculated delays at unsignalized intersections
                                              in the study area. Cautious judgment should therefore be exercised when
                                              interpreting the capacity analysis results at unsignalized intersections.

                                               intersection of Southampton Road (Route 10/202) at North Road (Route 202) is not

                                               weekday evening peak hour. Furthermore, the intersection is expected to operate at
                                               acceptable levels of service during the Build conditions, with slight increases in

 Unsignalized Intersection Capacity Analysis
                                               Three unsignalized site driveways were analyzed for the 2018 Build conditions. The
                                               results of the analyses are shown in Table 6.

                                               Table 6 shows that during the 2018 Build conditions the two full access site
                                               driveways are expected to operate at an acceptable LOS during both the peak hours.

                                              This study has been prepared to evaluate the traffic impacts associated with the
                                              construction of a proposed Cumberland Farms Convenience Store with Gasoline
                                              Sales (10 vehicle fueling positions) to be located on the southwestern corner of the
                                              intersection of Southampton Road (Route 10/202) at North Road (route 202) in the
                                              City of Westfield, Massachusetts. The following is a summary of study findings:

                                                      x      The proposed redevelopment is expected to generate approximately 135 (70
                                                             enter, 65 exit) total vehicle trips during the weekday afternoon peak hour,
                                                             and 175 (90 enter, 85 exit) total vehicle trips during the Saturday midday
                                                             peak hour. Given the nature of a fueling facility, the demand is generally a
                                                             function of the adjacent street traffic volumes, and typically consists of
                                                             primarily drive-by traffic. For this type of development, approximately 62
                                                             percent of the site-generated traffic could be drive-by traffic or traffic that is
                                                             already on the roadway. However, because the project abuts State Highway,
                                                             traffic guidelines set by the State and MassDOT only allow a 25 percent pass-
                                                             by credit when conducting a traffic study. Therefore, this traffic study
                                                             utilized a conservative methodology.

                                                      x       The Cumberland Farms convenience store and fueling facility will be
                                                              adequately served by three site driveways, one full access driveway on
                                                              Southampton Road (Route 10/202) and one full access driveway on North
                                                              Road, as well as an entrance only driveway along Southampton Road. The
                                                              location of the site driveways allow for full use of the site from a vehicle
                                                              circulation perspective. At fueling facilities it is ideal to allow multiple access
                                                              points so that traffic does not impact the adjacent roadways, and so that
                                                              traffic can circulate the site in a more efficient manner.

                                                      x       The results of this study (as shown in Tables 5 and 6) indicate that the study
                                                              area intersection and roadways are not expected to be significantly impacted
                                                              by the proposed project, and there is sufficient capacity to accommodate the
                                                              conservative increase in traffic that has been projected.

                                              In summary, it is the finding of this traffic impact and access study is that the study
                                              area intersections and roadways are not expected to be significantly impacted by the
                                              addition of the anticipated traffic generated by the proposed development.

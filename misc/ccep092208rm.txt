City Manager's Proposed Action:

Recognize and commend Jasmin Korman and Zeljko Veric for their actions at Kensington Place Apartments.

Overview:

On Thursday, August 28, 2008, at 7:29 p.m., the Brooklyn Park Fire Department responded to a reported
apartment fire at 8316 Zane Avenue North. First-arriving units found heavy black smoke coming from the rear
of the building.

The fire was started by a gas leak in an apartment. It extended out the patio door and up to the third floor.
There were three apartments with heavy fire damage, and another three with some fire damage.

An Award of Commendation is being presented to Jasmin Korman and Zeljko Veric for admirable actions
rendered which ultimately contributed to the protection of life and property at Kensington Place Apartments.

City Manager's Proposed Action:

MOTION __________, SECOND ___________, TO WAIVE THE READING AND ADOPT RESOLUTION
#2008- _______ REQUESTING THAT THE STATE OF MINNESOTA CHARITABLE GAMBLING
CONTROL BOARD APPROVE THE ISSUANCE OF A LAWFUL GAMBLING PREMISE PERMIT FOR
THE BROOKLYN PARK LIONS AT RUM RUNNER'S BAR & RIVER GRILL, 9510 WEST RIVER ROAD
N, BROOKLYN PARK.

Overview:

The Brooklyn Park Lions has submitted a completed application for a Lawful Gambling Premise Permit to
conduct lawful gambling at Rum Runner's Bar & River Grill, 9510 West River Rd N. The Gambling Control
Board requires a resolution approving the application for the premise permit for the lawful gambling license.
The completed application and adopted resolution will be sent to the Gambling Control Board for final action.
The Brooklyn Park Lions currently conducts lawful gambling at Grand Rios - Ramada, 6900 Lakeland Ave N.

On the June 23, 2008 RFCA for the on-sale intoxicating liquor license for Rum Runner's Bar & Grill, it was
indicated that the new owner stated permits will be submitted within 60 days to replace the roof. This permit
was finally issued on September 5, 2008. Upon receiving the request for the lawful gambling premise permit,
the information was forwarded to the Community Development Department for their review. A compliance
notice was sent to Mr. Tony Okafor, 9510 West River Road, for some outstanding issues. They are waiting for
a letter from Mr. Okafor regarding compliance of the outstanding issues.

Based upon previous council actions reflecting a concern of operating this establishment in a residential area,
staff recommends that the hours of gambling be restricted to 10:00 a.m. until 12:30 a.m. to coincide with the
Conditional Use Permit which restricts the hours of the liquor license.

City Manager's Proposed Action:

MOTION ___________, SECOND ___________, TO WAIVE THE READING AND ADOPT RESOLUTION
#2008-______ TO APPROVE COMMITMENT TO A COMPREHENSIVE RECYCLING AND YARD
WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND APPROVE THE 2008-10 MUNICIPAL RECYCLING GRANT
AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HENNEPIN COUNTY RECYCLING FUNDING POLICY.

Overview:

The City of Brooklyn Park provides all single family separate entry households with contracted collection of
recyclables, and centralized collection of recyclables for all common entry multi-family households. There is
also a contracted drop-off site for yard waste and brush, a twice annual four-city drop-off for special materials
such as tires, motor oil, appliances, electronic devices, scrap metal, and a Spruce Up the Park bulky waste
curbside collection of general household junk, appliances, and scrap metal, which rotates throughout the City
covering approximately 1/5 of the City each year. The City is also committed to a comprehensive public
information/education program, distributes a Recycling and Materials Management Guide, recycling calendar,
and updates information in newsletters and websites for the cities of Brooklyn Park, Brooklyn Center, Crystal,
and New Hope.

In 1994 Brooklyn Park entered into a cooperative administrative contract with the Hennepin Recycling Group
(HRG) cities of Brooklyn Center, Crystal, and New Hope for joint administration of both recycling programs,
administered out of the Brooklyn Park O & M Department administration offices, sharing both the recycling
program manager and support staff. This collaborative effort is both cost effective and efficient and serves over
42,000 households, which is the third largest program in the state, with a high level of customer service and
meets all State, County and local laws and ordinances.

It is the responsibility of the city to ensure that everyone has waste collection every week, which is provided by
licensed haulers under private contracts, and is responsible to ensure source separation of recyclable materials
from waste, with convenient separate service collection.

Hennepin County partners with cities to assist in funding the recycling program by distributing a portion of the
State of Minnesota "SCORE" recycling monies the County receives. The money is distributed based on each
                                                                                                      4.3 Page 2

City's share of the total number of households in the County. In 2008, Brooklyn Park's recycling grant is
$174,603. Similar amounts are anticipated for 2009 and 2010.

The recycling utility fee charged on each curbside account is $2.60 per household per month which has, when
combined with revenues received from the County, paid for the curbside program, yard waste site operations,
"Special Materials" and all administrative and education expenses.

Primary issues/alternatives to consider:

      ·   Should the Council approve the Municipal Recycling Grant Agreement and commitment to a
          comprehensive recycling and yard waste program in accordance with the Hennepin County Recycling
          Funding Policy?

          The grant funding is necessary to provide the comprehensive recycling program required by State statute
          and Hennepin County Ordinance, at a reduced cost.

      ·   The Council has the following alternatives:

          1.     Approve the Agreement as recommended.
          2.     Do nothing.

Budgetary/Fiscal Issues:

If the Agreement is approved, the 2008 Hennepin County Recycling Grant to the City is $174,603. If the
Agreement is not approved, these funds will be forfeited and the City would need to increase residents'
recycling service utility charge approximately $0.70 per household per month to cover budget and contractual
commitments, which would bring the charge from $2.60 to $3.30 per household per month.

                          RESIDENTIAL RECYCLING GRANT AGREEMENT


      This Agreement is between the COUNTY OF HENNEPIN, STATE OF MINNESOTA (the
"COUNTY") A-2300 Government Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55487, on behalf of the Hennepin County
Department of Environmental Services, 417 North Fifth Street, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401-1397
("DEPARTMENT") and the CITY OF BROOKLYN PARK, 8300 Noble Avenue North, Brooklyn Park,
Minnesota 55443 ("CITY").

                                                WITNESSETH:

       WHEREAS, the County Board, by Resolution No. 07-539, adopted on November 27, 2007, approved
the Hennepin County Residential Recycling Funding Policy for the period January 1, 2008, through December
31, 2010, and authorized grant funding for municipal recycling programs consistent with said policy; and

       WHEREAS, the CITY operates a municipal curbside residential recycling program and other waste
reduction and recycling activities (the Recycling Program) as described in their grant application referred to in
Section 2 below; and

       WHEREAS, said Recycling Program is consistent with Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 115A; the Office of
Environmental Assistance Solid Waste Management Policy Plan; Hennepin County's Solid Waste Management
Master Plan; and Hennepin County's Residential Recycling Funding Policy.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual undertakings and agreements hereinafter set forth,
the COUNTY, on behalf of the DEPARTMENT, and the CITY agree as follows:

1.     TERM AND COST OF THE AGREEMENT

               a.      This Agreement shall commence upon execution and terminate on December 31, 2010.

       b.      The initial grant payment for the year 2008 shall be equal to one hundred seventy-four thousand
               six hundred three dollars ($174,603). Grant payments for subsequent years shall be calculated as
               set forth in Section 3.

2.     SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED

       a.      The CITY will operate its Recycling Program as more fully described in the Grant Application
               that was submitted by the CITY and kept on file with the COUNTY. The CITY agrees to submit
               an updated Grant Application each year of the term of this Agreement in order to be eligible for
               future grant funds. The terms of the Grant Application, as updated each year, are incorporated
               herein by reference.

       b.      In addition to the services referred to above, the CITY agrees as follows:

               1.      On an annual basis, the CITY must demonstrate that the average pounds of recyclables
                       collected from households participating in their curbside residential recycling program
                                                                                     4.3 Page 6

     must equal or surpass the 2007 base year figure. The base year figure is determined by
     dividing total pounds of recyclables collected in 2007 by the total number of households
     participating in the curbside recycling program in 2007. Failure to achieve this annual
     goal will result in the requirement that a plan be submitted for COUNTY approval that
     specifies the efforts the CITY will undertake to increase the recycling percentage within
     90 days of the submittal of the municipal year-end report. The CITY may also be
     required to participate in COUNTY sponsored waste and recycling sorts to identify
     recovery levels of various recyclables in their community and to participate in efforts to
     increase recovery of target select recyclable materials being discarded in significant
     quantities. If the average pounds per household in any given year decreases from the
     base year by more than ten percent (10%), the COUNTY reserves the right to withhold
     the CITY's grant funds until the COUNTY is satisfied that reasonable efforts have been
     made to maintain the base year pounds per household.

2.   At a minimum, the CITY shall collect the following materials at curbside:

     a.     Newspaper and inserts;
     b.     Cardboard boxes;
     c.     Glass food and beverage containers;
     d.     Metal food and beverage containers;
     e.     All plastic bottles, except bottles that previously contained hazardous materials or
            motor oil;
     f.     Magazines and catalogs;
     g.     Cereal, cracker, pasta, cake mix, shoe , gift, and electronics boxes;
     h.     Boxes from toothpaste, medications, and other toiletries; and
     i.     Mail, office, and school papers.

3.   The CITY must estimate its participation rate in the curbside recycling program during
     the month of October of each year. Methodology for measuring participation must be
     approved by the COUNTY.

4.   The CITY shall submit, on forms provided by the COUNTY, a Final 2008 Report by
     February 15, 2009; a Final 2009 Report by February 15, 2010; and a Final 2010 Report
     by February 15, 2011. The CITY shall submit an updated Grant Application by February
     15 of each year.

5.   All grant funds accepted by the CITY from the COUNTY pursuant to this Agreement
     shall be used to operate its Recycling Program, including capital and operating expenses
     related thereto, in the year granted. The CITY shall not retain any grant funds in excess
     of actual Recycling Program expenses.

6.   The CITY may not charge its residents through property tax, utility fees, or any other
     method for that portion of the costs of its Recycling Program that is funded by COUNTY
     grant funds.

7.   The CITY shall establish a separate accounting mechanism, such as a project number,
     activity number, cost center, or fund that will separate recycling and waste reduction
     revenues and expenditures from all other municipal activities, including solid waste and
     yard waste activities.
                                                                                                    4.3 Page 7

            8.      Recycling and waste reduction activities, revenues, and expenditures are subject to audit
                    by the COUNTY.

            9.      If the CITY does not contract for curbside services, the CITY will receive grant funds
                    provided that at least ninety percent (90%) of the grant funds are credited back to
                    residents and the CITY meets all minimum program requirements. The additional ten
                    percent (10%) of grant funds may be used for CITY administrative and promotional
                    expenses.

3.   METHOD OF PAYMENT

     a.     The COUNTY will distribute grant funds annually only to the extent the COUNTY has received
            SCORE funds from the State of Minnesota. SCORE funds are based on revenue received by the
            State of Minnesota from a sales tax on garbage collection and disposal fees and are subject to
            change based on revenue received and allocated by the State. The CITY will receive grant funds
            per the formula below:

             # of Households
             Serviced Curbside by       Total SCORE                    Grant Funds
             CITY                       Revenue
             _________________        X Received by               =    Distributed to
                                        COUNTY from State              CITY
                                        of Minnesota
             Total # of
             Households Serviced
             Curbside in
             COUNTY

     b.     Under no circumstances will the COUNTY's distribution of grant funds exceed the CITY's
            proportion of SCORE fund revenues received by the COUNTY.

     c.     The initial grant fund payment will be forwarded after the County Board receives and approves
            this Agreement signed by an authorized official of the CITY. Provided the CITY is otherwise in
            compliance with the terms of this Agreement, future grant fund payments will be made after
            submittal by the CITY and approval by the COUNTY of the updated Grant Application and
            Final Report as described in Section 2 and receipt by the COUNTY of SCORE funds from the
            State of Minnesota.

4.   INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

     CITY shall select the means, method, and manner of performing the services. Nothing is intended or
     should be construed as creating or establishing the relationship of co-partners between the parties or as
     constituting CITY as the agent, representative, or employee of the COUNTY for any purpose. CITY is
     and shall remain an independent contractor for all services performed under this Agreement. CITY shall
     secure at its own expense all personnel required in performing services under this Agreement. Any
     personnel of CITY or other persons while engaged in the performance of any work or services required
     by CITY will have no contractual relationship with the COUNTY and will not be considered employees
     of the COUNTY. The COUNTY shall not be responsible for any claims that arise out of employment or
     alleged employment under the Minnesota Economic Security Law or the Workers' Compensation Act of
     the State of Minnesota on behalf of any personnel, including, without limitation, claims of
                                                                                                     4.3 Page 8

     discrimination against CITY, its officers, agents, contractors, or employees. CITY shall defend,
     indemnify, and hold harmless the COUNTY, its officials, officers, agents, volunteers, and employees
     from all such claims irrespective of any determination of any pertinent tribunal, agency, board,
     commission, or court. Such personnel or other persons shall neither require nor be entitled to any
     compensation, rights, or benefits of any kind from the COUNTY, including, without limitation, tenure
     rights, medical and hospital care, sick and vacation leave, Workers' Compensation, Re-employment
     Compensation, disability, severance pay, and retirement benefits.

5.   INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     A.     CITY agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the COUNTY, its officials, officers,
            agents, volunteers and employees from any liability, claims, causes of action, judgments,
            damages, losses, costs, or expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, resulting directly or
            indirectly from any act or omission of CITY, a subcontractor, anyone directly or indirectly
            employed by them, and/or anyone for whose acts and/or omissions they may be liable in the
            performance of the services required by this Agreement, and against all loss by reason of the
            failure of CITY to perform any obligation under this Agreement.

     B.     In order to protect CITY and those listed above under the indemnification provision, CITY
            agrees at all times during the term of this Agreement, and beyond such term when so required, to
            have and keep in force the following insurance, either under a self-insurance program or
            insurance policies as follows:

                                                                                 Limits
            1.     Commercial General Liability on an occurrence
                   basis with contractual liability coverage:

                   General Aggregate                                         $2,000,000
                   Products--Completed Operations Aggregate                   2,000,000
                   Personal and Advertising Injury                            1,000,000
                   Each Occurrence--Combined Bodily
                   Injury and Property Damage                                 1,000,000

            2.     Workers' Compensation and Employer's Liability:

                   Workers' Compensation                                   Statutory
                   If CITY is based outside the State of Minnesota, coverage must
                   apply to Minnesota law. In accordance with Minnesota law, if
                   CITY is a sole proprietor, it is exempted from the above
                   Workers' Compensation requirements. In the event that CITY
                   should hire employees or subcontract this work, CITY shall
                   obtain the required insurance.

                   Employer's Liability. Bodily injury by:
                     Accident--Each Accident                                    500,000
                     Disease--Policy Limit                                      500,000

     C.     An umbrella or excess policy over primary liability insurance coverages is an acceptable method
            to provide the required insurance limits.
                                                                                                    4.3 Page 9

            The above establishes minimum insurance requirements. Upon written request, CITY shall
            promptly submit copies of insurance policies to the COUNTY.

6.   DATA PRACTICES

     CITY, its officers, agents, owners, partners, employees, volunteers and subcontractors shall abide by the
     provisions of the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 13 (MGDPA),
     the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and implementing regulations, if applicable, and
     all other applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations and orders relating to data privacy or
     confidentiality. CITY agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the COUNTY, its officials,
     officers, agents, employees, and volunteers from any claims resulting from CITY's officers', agents',
     owners', partners', employees', volunteers', assignees' or subcontractors' unlawful disclosure and/or use
     of such protected data, or other noncompliance with the requirements of this section. CITY agrees to
     promptly notify the COUNTY if it becomes aware of any potential claims, or facts giving rise to such
     claims, under the MGDPA. The terms of this section shall survive the cancellation or termination of this
     Agreement.

7.   RECORDS ­ AVAILABILITY/ACCESS

     Subject to the requirements of Minnesota Statutes Section 16C.05, Subd. 5, CITY agrees that the
     COUNTY, the State Auditor, the Legislative Auditor or any of their authorized representatives, at any
     time during normal business hours, and as often as they may reasonably deem necessary, shall have
     access to and the right to examine, audit, excerpt, and transcribe any books, documents, papers, records,
     etc., which are pertinent to the accounting practices and procedures of CITY and involve transactions
     relating to this Agreement. CITY shall maintain these materials and allow access during the period of
     this Agreement and for six (6) years after its termination or cancellation.

8.   SUCCESSORS, SUBCONTRACTING AND ASSIGNMENTS

     A.     CITY binds itself, its partners, successors, assigns and legal representatives to the COUNTY for
            all covenants, agreements and obligations contained in the contract documents.

     B.     CITY shall not assign, transfer or pledge this Agreement and/or the services to be performed,
            whether in whole or in part, nor assign any monies due or to become due to it without the prior
            written consent of the COUNTY. A consent to assign shall be subject to such conditions and
            provisions as the COUNTY may deem necessary, accomplished by execution of a form prepared
            by the COUNTY and signed by CITY, the assignee and the COUNTY. Permission to assign,
            however, shall under no circumstances relieve CITY of its liabilities and obligations under the
            Agreement.

     C.     CITY shall not subcontract this Agreement and/or the services to be performed, whether in
            whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the COUNTY. Permission to subcontract,
            however, shall under no circumstances relieve CITY of its liabilities and obligations under the
            Agreement. Further, CITY shall be fully responsible for the acts, omissions, and failure of its
            subcontractors in the performance of the specified contractual services, and of person(s) directly
            or indirectly employed by subcontractors. Contracts between CITY and each subcontractor shall
            require that the subcontractor's services be performed in accordance with the terms and
            conditions specified.
                                                                                                   4.3 Page 10

9.    MERGER AND MODIFICATION

      A.   It is understood and agreed that the entire Agreement between the parties is contained herein and
           that this Agreement supersedes all oral agreements and negotiations between the parties relating
           to the subject matter. All items that are referenced or that are attached are incorporated and
           made a part of this Agreement. If there is any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and
           referenced or attached items, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.

      B.   Any alterations, variations, modifications, or waivers of provisions of this Agreement shall only
           be valid when they have been reduced to writing as an amendment to this Agreement signed by
           the parties.

10.   DEFAULT AND CANCELLATION

      A.   If CITY fails to perform any of the provisions of this Agreement or so fails to administer the
           work as to endanger the performance of the Agreement, it shall be in default. Unless CITY's
           default is excused by the COUNTY, the COUNTY may upon written notice immediately cancel
           this Agreement in its entirety. Additionally, failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement
           shall be just cause for the COUNTY to delay payment until CITY's compliance. In the event of
           a decision to withhold payment, the COUNTY shall furnish prior written notice to CITY.

      B.   Upon early termination or cancellation of this Agreement, the CITY shall itemize any and all
           grant funds expenditures up to the date of termination or cancellation and return such grant funds
           not yet expended.

      C.   Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, CITY shall remain liable to the
           COUNTY for damages sustained by the COUNTY by virtue of any breach of this Agreement by
           CITY. Upon notice to CITY of the claimed breach and the amount of the claimed damage, the
           COUNTY may withhold any payments to CITY for the purpose of set-off until such time as the
           exact amount of damages due the COUNTY from CITY is determined. Following notice from
           the COUNTY of the claimed breach and damage, CITY and the COUNTY shall attempt to
           resolve the dispute in good faith.

      D.   The above remedies shall be in addition to any other right or remedy available to the COUNTY
           under this Agreement, law, statute, rule, and/or equity.

      E.   The COUNTY's failure to insist upon strict performance of any provision or to exercise any
           right under this Agreement shall not be deemed a relinquishment or waiver of the same, unless
           consented to in writing. Such consent shall not constitute a general waiver or relinquishment
           throughout the entire term of the Agreement.

      F.   This Agreement may be canceled with or without cause by either party upon thirty (30) day
           written notice.

      G.   In the event the COUNTY does not receive any SCORE funds, this Agreement will be
           terminated upon written notice by the COUNTY.

      H.   Provisions that by their nature are intended to survive the term, cancellation or termination of
           this Agreement include but are not limited to: INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR;
           INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE; DATA PRACTICES; RECORDS-

    Hennepin County, Minnesota




   Residential Recycling
     Funding Policy
January 1, 2008 ­December 31, 2010




         Hennepin County

         Department of Environmental Services
                                                                                                        4.3 Page 14

I.      Policy Description
The Hennepin County Board of Commissioners has determined that curbside collection of recyclables from
Hennepin County residents is an effective strategy to prevent unnecessary disposal of valuable resources,
maximize existing processing and minimize landfilling of waste. Therefore, Hennepin County has adopted the
Residential Recycling Funding Policy to distribute all SCORE funds received by the County to municipalities
for curbside collection of residential recyclables.

Length of Residential Recycling Funding Policy

Hennepin County is committed to implement this policy and continue distributing SCORE funds for the
purpose of funding curbside residential recycling programs from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010.
In the event that SCORE funds are eliminated from the State budget or significantly reduced, the County will
consult with municipalities at that time and develop a subsequent recommendation to the County Board on
continuation of this policy and future funding of curbside recycling programs.

Fund Distribution

The County will distribute to Hennepin County municipalities one hundred percent (100%) of SCORE funds
that the county receives from the state. SCORE funds are based on revenue received by the State of Minnesota
from a sales tax on garbage collection and disposal fees. SCORE funds are subject to change based on revenue
received and allocated by the legislature. Funds distributed to municipalities for the current calendar year will
be based on SCORE funds received by the County in the State's corresponding fiscal year.

Each municipality will receive SCORE funds proportional to the number of eligible residential housing units in
its curbside collection program on January 1 of each funding year relative to the total number of eligible
residential housing units in the county that are served by curbside recycling service. The following formula will
be utilized to determine a City's SCORE grant for each year.

      # of Households Served                    Total SCORE

        Curbside by CITY             X        Revenue Received        =        SCORE Funds
     Total # of Households                    by COUNTY from                 Distributed to CITY
 Served Curbside in COUNTY                    State of Minnesota

The funds can be used for all recycling program expenses including capital and operating costs. Eligible
residential housing units are defined as single family through eight-plex residential buildings or other residential
buildings where each housing unit sets out their own refuse and recycling container for curbside collection.

II.     Responsibilities of Municipalities

Application for Funding
Each municipality or consortium must complete an application and forward it to Hennepin County by February
15th to receive funding for that year. The application must be accompanied by a resolution authorizing submittal
of the application.
                                                                                                         4.3 Page 15

Grant Agreement
Each municipality or consortium will enter into a Recycling Grant Agreement with the County. The Grant
Agreement will be conveyed to the municipality or consortium after Board approval of their 2008 application
and grant amount for a term concurrent with the expiration of this policy, December 31, 2010.

Minimum Program Requirements
1. Recycling Performance. On an annual basis, municipal recycling programs must demonstrate that a
   reasonable effort has been made to maintain and increase the average pounds per household of recyclables
   collected from their curbside residential recycling program in the base year of 2007. The base year pounds
   per household will be determined by dividing the total pounds of recyclables collected in 2007 by the total
   number of households participating in the curbside recycling program in 2007. Failure to achieve this
   annual goal will result in the requirement that a plan be submitted for Hennepin County approval that
   specifies the efforts the recycling program will undertake to increase the recycling percentage within 90
   days of the submittal of the municipal or consortium year-end report. The municipality may also be
   required to participate in County sponsored waste and recycling sorts to identify recovery levels of various
   recyclables in their community and to participate in efforts to increase recovery of target select recyclable
   materials being discarded in significant quantities. If the average pounds per household in any given year
   decreases from the base year by more than ten percent, the County reserves the right to withhold that
   municipality's or consortium's grant funds until the County is satisfied that reasonable efforts have been
   made to maintain the base year pounds per household. Reasonable efforts will generally be considered as
   at least twice annual promotion of that municipality's or consortium's recycling program through
   educational vehicles such as an article in city newsletters, direct mailings, utility bill inserts, flyers hung on
   waste carts or placed in recycling containers, and distribution of program information at community events.
2. Materials to be Collected. At a minimum, the following materials must be collected at curbside:
   a.     newspaper and inserts;
   b.     cardboard boxes;
   c.     glass food and beverage containers;
   d.     metal food and beverage cans;
   e.     all plastic bottles except bottles that previously contained hazardous materials or motor oil;
   f.     magazines and catalogs;
   g.     Cereal, cracker, pasta, cake mix, shoe, gift, and electronics boxes;
   h.     Boxes from toothpaste, medications and other toiletries; and
   i.     Mail, office and school papers.
3. Participation Rates. The municipality or consortium must estimate its participation rate in the curbside
   recycling program during the month of October. Methodology for measuring participation must be
   approved by the county prior to execution of a grant agreement.
4. Reporting Requirements. A final report must be submitted electronically to the County utilizing the Retrac
   web based reporting system by February 15 of each year. If a municipality or consortium is unable to
   access the Retrac system, the County must be contacted by February 1 to make arrangements for alternative
   filing of the required report.
5. Use of Funds.
   a. All grant funds accepted from the county must be used for waste reduction and recycling capital and
       operating expenses in the year granted. Recycling programs will not be reimbursed any funds in excess
       of actual expenses.
   b. A municipality or township may not charge its residents through property tax, utility fees or any other
       method for that portion of the costs of its recycling program funded by county grant funds.
                                                                                                      4.3 Page 16

   c.   The municipality or consortium must establish a separate accounting mechanism, such as a project
        number, activity number, or fund that will separate recycling revenues and expenditures from other
        municipal activities, including solid waste and yard waste activities.
   d.   Recycling and waste reduction activities, revenues, and expenditures are subject to audit.
   e.   Municipalities that do not contract for curbside recycling services will receive grant funds provided that
        at least ninety percent (90%) of the grant funds are credited back to residents and the city meets all
        minimum program requirements. The additional ten percent (10%) may be used for municipal
        administrative and promotional expenses.

Partnership
The partnership between the County and municipalities and consortiums has been highly effective in educating
and motivating behavior of residents resulting in significant amounts of waste being reduced and recycled. In
order to continue this partnership and increase these efforts, educational and promotional activities of
municipalities and consortiums should be coordinated with County and regional efforts. The region through the
Solid Waste Management Coordinating Board has made significant efforts as part of the RETHINK
RECYCLING campaign to develop consistent terminology for use in residential recycling communication
pieces. It is expected that municipalities and consortiums will use the terminology developed in this campaign
in development of educational pieces for their residents as well as other elements of the RETHINK
RECYCLING campaign.

Municipal representatives are required to attend quarterly recycling coordinator meetings in order to facilitate
coordination of efforts. Municipalities will work with the County to coordinate and conduct educational and
promotional activities at least once per year to target high volume materials in the waste stream that could be
reduced, reused or captured for recycling and include information about recycling and targeted materials on
their web site, if the municipality has a web site.

III. Responsibilities Of Hennepin County

Application Form
Hennepin County will develop and mail an application/final report form by January 15 that each municipality or
consortium will use to report on their recycling program and request grant fund for that respective year.

Payments
Grant payments will be made to a municipality or consortium in the initial year of this policy upon execution of
a grant agreement. In subsequent years, grant payments will be made upon submittal of an approved final
report.

 Item:                    Oxbow Commons Updated Alternative Urban Area-Wide Review

City Manager's Proposed Action:

MOTION _________, SECOND _________, TO WAIVE THE READING AND ADOPT RESOLUTION
#2008-______ APPROVING THE OXBOW COMMONS UPDATED ALTERNATIVE URBAN AREA-
WIDE REVIEW.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff recommends approving the Updated AUAR.

Overview:
In 2002, the City Council approved the Alternative Urban Area-Wide Review (AUAR) for the Oxbow
Commons master-planned community north of Highway 610 between Regent and Zane Avenues. Since its
approval, Columbia Park Medical Center, Oakwood at Oxbow Commons, Villas at Oxbow Lake, Lakeside at
Oxbow Commons, and St. Therese of Oxbow Lake were approved and constructed. Several acres of
commercial, office, and medium-density residential land remain undeveloped. Environmental Quality Board
(EQB) rules state that an update to the AUAR must be made to a project if it is not completed within five years.

The Updated AUAR includes analysis of the original predictions, including the portions that were actually
constructed, and the completed infrastructure. Since its 2002 adoption, Oak Grove Parkway (old 97th Avenue)
and several of the local internal streets were constructed and Zane, Regent, and 101st Avenues were
reconstructed.

In order for additional development to occur in Oxbow Commons, the update of the AUAR must be approved
by the City. All future development will be subject to our regular master planning/site plan review process and
is also subject to the Oxbow C.

Budgetary/Fiscal Issues: N/A

Alternatives to consider:
1. Approve the AUAR.
2. Request additional information.
3. Deny the AUAR based on certain findings.

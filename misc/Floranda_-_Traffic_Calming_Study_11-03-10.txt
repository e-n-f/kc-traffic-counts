                                   INTRODUCTION



As a subconsultant to Craven Thompson and Associates, Inc., Traf Tech Engineering,
Inc. was retained by the City of Oakland Park to conduct the following three tasks:


   1. Determine the potential speed reduction along Floranda Road between Federal
       Highway and Dixie Highway as a result of implementing traffic-calming devices
       along the subject east-west collector street.     Additionally, the impacts these
       traffic-calming devices may have on the surrounding neighborhood are also
       addressed in this report.


   2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the traffic calming devices implemented within the
       residential neighborhood (Central Corals) located south of Floranda Road
       between Federal Highway and Dixie Highway. The need for additional traffic
       calming devices was also evaluated as part of this task.

   3. Evaluate the operation of the intersection of Floranda Road and NE 18th Avenue
       to determine if a median with an entrance feature can be implemented on
       Floranda Road just west of the subject intersection.




                                            1                     Floranda Road ­ Traffic Calming
                FLORANDA ROAD TRAFFIC CALMING DEVICES


The City of Oakland Park is proposing several traffic calming devices along Floranda
Road between Dixie Highway and Federal Highway. The proposed traffic calming
devices include two traffic roundabouts, two traffic chokers, and a potential median with
an entrance feature. The traffic circles are proposed at NE 13th Avenue and at NE 16th
Avenue (east segment of NE 16th Avenue). The two traffic chokers are proposed west of
NE 15th Avenue and east of NE 15th Terrace. The median with an entrance feature is
planned to be located west of NE 18th Avenue (prior to the eastbound left-turn lane).
Figure 1 on the following page depicts the location of the proposed traffic calming
devices.


Based on Broward County records, Floranda Road is currently operating at a deficient
level of service due to the amount of traffic using this east-west collector street. In order
to evaluate the benefits associated with the implementation of the traffic calming devices
described above, the potential speed reduction along Floranda Road between Dixie
Highway and Federal Highway was determined. A comparison between the existing and
future operating speeds along Floranda Road was undertaken using the CORSIM micro-
simulation software.


For the CORSIM analyses, PM peak hour traffic volumes (worse peak period) were used.
In addition to the input of traffic volumes, existing and future traffic control devices were
coded to replicate traffic conditions within the study area. Once the model runs were
completed, the animated simulations were viewed to assess reasonableness of the traffic
flow throughout the study area.


Since CORSIM is a stochastic model that randomly assigns vehicles to the roadway
network prior to the beginning of the simulation time period, CORSIM should be run
multiple times using different initial network loadings and the model output should be
averaged to eliminate the potential for obtaining skewed (biased) results.

However, due to the linear nature of the study area, different seed numbers yielded
almost identical results and therefore, multiple runs using different random seed numbers
were not considered necessary for purposes of this analysis.


The results of the CORSIM analyses are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. As indicated in
Tables 1 and 2, even though the overall average speed along Floranda Road is not
significantly reduced as a result of the traffic calming devices, traffic speeds are
significantly lower at and near the traffic calming devices, especially the traffic
roundabouts. Therefore, safety is improved as a result of implementing the two traffic
roundabouts and the traffic chokers. The lower speeds near the traffic calming devices
will benefit traffic entering Floranda Road from the residential neighborhoods located
north and south of the subject east-west collector street.

                        TRAFFIC CALMING EVALUATION


Traf Tech Engineering, Inc. evaluated traffic conditions within the residential
neighborhood (Central Corals) bounded by Floranda Road on the north, NE 38th Street on
the south, Federal Highway on the east, and Dixie Highway on the west. For this
evaluation, the following tasks were undertaken:


   1. Reviewed previous speed-volume data recorded within the subject residential
       community


   2. Conducted new speed-volume data in order to determine the effects caused by the
       recently-installed traffic calming devices (speed humps) along NE 16th Avenue


   3. Collected 6-hour intersection turning movement counts in order to determine if
       outside traffic is cutting-through the subject residential neighborhood


Previous Speed-Volume Traffic Counts
Speed-volume traffic counts were collected by the City of Oakland Park in October 2007,
prior to the implementation of traffic calming devices (speed humps) along NE 16th
Avenue. The 2007 speed-volume traffic counts were recorded along NE 15th Avenue,
NE 16th Avenue, and along NE 16th Terrace. Tables 3 through 5 summarize the results of
the speed-volume traffic counts collected within the Central Corals Neighborhood.

As indicated in Tables 3 through 5, a speeding problem existed in 2007 along the three
north-south study facilities. Even though the posted speed limit is 25 miles per hour, the
actual recorded speeds ranged between 32.9 mph and 37.9 mph. Therefore, traffic
calming is warranted along NE 15th Avenue, NE 16th Avenue, and NE 16th Terrace based
on the travel speeds recorded in October 2007.


According to the Institute of Transportation Engineers, traffic volumes on residential
streets should not exceed 1,200 vehicles per day in order to have acceptable living
conditions. As indicated in the above three tables, NE 15th Avenue and NE 16th Terrace
have traffic volumes well below the 1,200-vehicle threshold. However, NE 16th Avenue
carried well over 2,000 vehicles per day in 2007. Hence, traffic calming devices were
warranted along NE 16th Avenue in 2007.


The speed-volume data recorded by the City of Oakland Park in 2007 within the Central
Corals Neighborhood is contained in Appendix B.

Updated Speed-Volume Traffic Counts
Traf Tech Engineering, Inc., in association with Genesis Transportation Engineering,
Inc., collected speed-volume traffic counts along NE 15th Avenue and NE 16th Avenue.
The new speed-volume traffic count data was recorded in September 2010, after the
speed humps were installed along NE 16th Avenue. The new speed-volume count data
indicates that:


    o Traffic volumes have remained constant along NE 15th Avenue (a comparison
        between 2007 and 2010 traffic data)


    o Speeds have remained relatively constant (speeding problem) along NE 15th
        Avenue between 2007 and 2010

    o The implementation of the speed humps along NE 16th Avenue have significantly
        reduced speeds (from 35 mph to 28 mph near NE 38th Street and from 36 mph to
        25 mph near Floranda Road) within the Central Corals neighborhood

    o The recently-collected traffic counts along NE 16th Avenue indicate that
        significantly less traffic is using NE 16th Avenue since the implementation of the
        traffic calming devices (speed humps).


Tables 6 and 7 document the results of the September 2010 speed-volume traffic counts.

Based on the results of the speed-volume traffic counts, before and after the
implementation of the speed humps along NE 16th Avenue, it is recommended that speed
humps be implemented along NE 15th Avenue and along NE 16th Terrace.


Appendix C contains the results of the 2010 speed-volume traffic counts.


Six-Hour Intersection Turning Movement Counts
Six-hour intersection turning movement counts were collected at the following two
intersections:


    1. Floranda Road and NE 16th Avenue
    2. NE 38th Street and NE 16th Avenue


The 6-hour intersection turning movement counts were recorded on Wednesday,
September 15, 2010 during the typical morning and afternoon rush hours, and the midday
peak period. The purpose of intersection turning movement counts was to determine if
cut-through traffic is likely occurring within the Central Corals residential neighborhood.
The results of the 6-hour intersection turning movement counts are presented in Figure 2.


Appendix D contains the 6-hour intersection turning movement counts, as recorded in the
field.

ENGINEERING, INC.                            (Wednesday, September 15, 2010)                                                                             Oakland Park, Florida
Based on a review of the 6-hour intersection turning movement counts, as depicted in
Figure 2, the following conclusions are reached:


   o Several vehicles were recorded making an illegal left-turn at the intersection of
       Floranda Road and NE 16th Avenue (the northbound left-turn movement is
       prohibited at this location). However, based on the current traffic levels recorded
       at this intersection and at the intersection of NE 38th Street/NE 16th Avenue, the
       subject turn restriction could be eliminated.


   o A significant amount of northbound and southbound through traffic was recorded
       at the intersection of NE 38th Street and NE 16th Avenue. Since NE 16th Avenue
       continues south and connects with Oakland Park Boulevard, this north-south
       roadway is used for north-south mobility within this area.

   o The traffic counts suggest that NE 16th Avenue is currently not being utilized as a
       short-cut route between NE 38th Street and Floranda Road.

                     FLORANDA ROAD AND NE 18th AVENUE


The signalized intersection of Floranda Road and NE 18th Avenue was evaluated in order
to determine if a raised median (traffic calming device) can be implemented on Floranda
Road just west of NE 18th Avenue. The subject intersection is a four-legged intersection
with an offset (jog) between the north and south legs of the intersection. The north leg is
located approximately 70 feet east of the sough leg. The current lane geometry of the
Floranda Road/NE 18th Avenue intersection is as follows:


Northbound Approach
   o One approach lane


Southbound Approach
   o One approach lane. However, the southbound single lane widens at Floranda
       Road to a width that permits two stopped vehicles side by side.


Eastbound Approach
   o One left-turn lane with a storage capacity of approximately 50 feet
   o One shared through/right-turn lane


Westbound Approach
   o One approach lane


In order to evaluate the intersection of Floranda Road and NE 18th Avenue, the following
tasks were undertaken:


   1. Intersection Turning Movement Counts
   2. Development of Future Traffic Volumes
   3. Capacity/Level of Service Analyses

Intersection Turning Movement Counts
Traf Tech Engineering, Inc., in association with Genesis Transportation Engineering,
Inc., collected intersection turning movement counts on Tuesday, September 14, 2010
from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM at the signalized intersection of
Floranda Road and NE 18th Avenue.


The results of the intersection turning movement counts undertaken during the AM and
PM peak hours are summarized below:




As indicated in the traffic counts depicted above, there is a significant amount of
eastbound left-turning traffic (east Floranda Road to north NE 18th Avenue) at the subject
intersection.   The amount of eastbound left-turn traffic recorded suggests that an
eastbound left-turn lane with adequate storage length is warranted at this location.
Moreover, the southbound approach has many vehicles turning left and right during the
morning peak period.




                                           12                  Floranda Road ­ Traffic Calming
Based on the above traffic counts, two southbound approach lanes should be considered
at this location (one for left-turning vehicles and one for right-turning traffic).
Appendix E contains the intersection turning movement counts, as collected in the field.


The signalized intersection of Floranda Road and NE 18th Avenue is controlled by
Broward County's signal system. The current signal timing plan was provided by the
County and is also contained in Appendix E.

Development of Future Traffic Volumes
In order to develop future-year traffic volumes for the intersection of Floranda Road and
NE 18th venue, the existing AM and PM peak hour traffic counts collected in the field
during the month of September were increased to reflect average peak season conditions.
Based on FDOT's Peak Season Factor Category report, a factor of 1.09 is required to
convert traffic counts collected in the second week of September to average peak season
conditions (refer to Appendix F). The future traffic calculations to reflect average peak
season adjustments for the study intersection are contained in Appendix G in tabular
format.


Level of Service Analyses
Intersection capacity analyses were performed for the study intersection of Floranda
Road and NE 18th Avenue. The analyses were undertaken following the capacity/level of
service procedures outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual.           The results of the
intersection analyses are summarized in Table 8. Appendix H contains the computer
printouts of the intersection capacity analyses.

As indicated in Table 8, the southbound approach of the intersection is operating
deficiently during both the AM and PM peak hours. This deficiency can be corrected by
providing two southbound approach lanes (one for left-turning vehicles and one for right-
turning traffic). Based on a field inspection conducted at the intersection, it appears there
is sufficient right-of-way to implement the two southbound approach lanes at the
intersection of Floranda Road and NE 18th Avenue.


Additionally, the eastbound left-turn traffic queues require approximately 240 feet of
storage capacity in order to avoid blockage of the eastbound through lane on Floranda
Road by the heavy eastbound left-turning vehicles. Therefore, it is recommended that the
storage capacity of the eastbound left-turn lane be lengthened to at least 240 feet.
Additionally, if a raised median is implemented on Floranda Road, west of NE 18th
Avenue, it should be located at least 300 feet west of the western segment of NE 18th
Avenue (west of the lengthened eastbound left-turn lane).

                                   CONCLUSIONS


As a subconsultant to Craven Thompson and Associates, Inc., Traf Tech Engineering,
Inc. was retained by the City of Oakland Park to determine the potential benefits of
implementing traffic-calming devices along Floranda Road, evaluate the effectiveness of
recently-installed speed humps within the Central Corals residential neighborhood, and to
determine if a raised median with an entrance feature can be implemented on Floranda
Road west of NE 18th Avenue. Additionally, the impacts the proposed traffic-calming
devices may have on the surrounding neighborhood are also addressed in this report. The
conclusions of the traffic study are summarized below:


   o Safety is improved along Floranda Road by implementing the two proposed
       traffic circles and the two planned traffic chokers. The lower speeds near the
       traffic calming devices will benefit traffic entering Floranda Road from the
       Central Corals and North Corals residential neighborhoods.            Hence, it is
       recommended that the proposed traffic calming devices (two traffic circles and
       two traffic chokers) be implemented on Floranda Road. The Floranda Road
       traffic calming devices will not have negative impacts to the neighborhood streets.


   o A speeding problem existed in 2007 within the Central Corals residential
       neighborhood (i.e., along NE 15th Avenue, NE 16th Avenue, and NE 16th Terrace).
       Therefore, traffic calming is warranted along the subject three north-south
       residential streets, regardless of any traffic calming devices installed on Floranda
       Road.

   o Recently-collected (September 2010) speed-volume traffic counts within the
       Central Corals residential neighborhood indicate that:

       -    Traffic volumes have remained constant along NE 15th Avenue




                                           15                   Floranda Road ­ Traffic Calming
   -    Speeds have remained relatively constant (speeding problem) along NE 15th
        Avenue between 2007 and 2010

   -    The implementation of the speed humps along NE 16th Avenue have
        significantly reduced speeds (from 35 mph to 28 mph near NE 38th Street and
        from 36 mph to 25 mph near Floranda Road) within the Central Corals
        neighborhood

   -    The recently-collected traffic counts along NE 16th Avenue indicate that
        significantly less traffic is using NE 16th Avenue since the implementation of
        the traffic calming devices (speed humps). The traffic that is no longer using
        NE 16th Avenue has not been diverted to NE 15th Avenue.

o Based on the preceding four sub-bullets, speed humps should be implemented
   along NE 15th Avenue and NE 16th Terrace.


o The existing "No Left-Turn" restriction at the intersection of Floranda Road and
   NE 16th Avenue could be eliminated.

o The traffic counts suggest that NE 16th Avenue is currently not being utilized as a
   short-cut route between NE 38th Street and Floranda Road.

o The storage capacity of the existing eastbound left-turn lane at the signalized
   intersection of Floranda Road and NE 16th Avenue should be lengthened to at
   least 240 feet.

o If a median with an entrance feature is implemented on Floranda Road, west of
   NE 18th Avenue, it should be located at least 300 feet west of the western segment
   of NE 18th Avenue (west of the lengthened eastbound left-turn lane).

DESIGN OF AN INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENT FOR SPALDING DR AT CHAMBLEE-
DUNWOODY RD

Sealed Proposals for Purchasing RFP 13-03 Design of an Intersection Improvement for Spalding
Drive at Chamblee-Dunwoody Road will be received by the City of Dunwoody, hereinafter
called "City." Service providers whose proposals meet the criteria established in the Request for
Proposals, at the sole discretion of the City, may be considered for Contract award. The City
may, by direct negotiation, finalize terms with the service provider who is selected for award
based on proposals. The City reserves the right to reject any or all responses for any reason.
Clarification of information may be requested by the City.

Work is to commence on or about September 1, 2013.

The City, at its sole discretion, may short-list firms that are deemed to best meet the Cit y's
requirements, taking into consideration all criteria listed in the RFP. Negotiations will be
conducted and may take place in person or via telephone with the most qualified firm as
identified by the City or, if short-listing occurs, with all of the short-listed proposers. Proposers
that participate in the negotiations may be given an opportunity to submit their best and final
offers. The City of Dunwoody requires pricing to remain firm for the duration of the contract.
Failure to hold firm pricing for the duration of the contract will be sufficient cause for the City to
declare a proposal non-responsive.

electronic copy in PDF of the technical proposals shall be submitted no later than 2:00pm,
Monday July 29, 2013. One copy of the cost proposal should be submitted in a separate,
sealed envelope from the technical proposal. (Proposals will not be submitted by facsimile or e-
mail). [Failure to submit the cost proposal in a separate, sealed envelope may result in your
proposal being deemed non-responsive.] At which time noted, all proposals received will be
publicly opened and read. Any proposal received after the time and date specified for the
opening of the proposals will not be considered, but will be returned unopened.

Questions regarding proposals should be directed to purchasing@dunwoodyga.gov no later
than 2:00pm July 16, 2013. Proposals are legal and binding when submitted.

(or subsequently rescheduled) for proposal opening.
RFP 13-03    Page 3 of 47



The City's staff will review all proposals submitted. After reviewing the proposals, staff may, at
its discretion, request formal presentations from one or more of the proposers (at proposer's
expense at the City's site) whose proposals appear to best meet the City's requirements. If
presentations are requested they will be scheduled for Monday, August 5, 2013.

The proposer awarded the Contract must provide proof of liability insurance in the amount of
one million dollars ($1,000,000.00), along with any other required insurance coverage and
evidence of business or occupational license, as outlined in the Proposal Documents.

The City reserves the right to waive any informalities or irregularities of proposals, to request
clarification or information submitted in any proposal, to request additional information from
any proposer, or to reject any or all proposals, and to re-advertise for proposals. The City also
reserves the right to extend the date or time scheduled for the opening of proposals.

Award, if made, will be to the responsible and responsive proposer submitting the proposal
which is deemed by the City, in the sole discretion, to be the most advantageous to the City,
price and other factors being considered.

To ensure the proper and fair evaluation of proposals, the City highly discourages any
communication initiated by a proposer or its agent to an employee of the City evaluating or
considering the proposal during the period of time following the issuance of the RFP, the
opening of proposals and prior to the time a decision has been made with respect to the Contract
award. An appropriate Purchasing employee of the City may initiate communication with a
proposer in order to obtain information or clarification needed to develop a proper and accurate
evaluation of the proposal. Any communication initiated by proposer during evaluation should
be submitted in writing and delivered to the City of Dunwoody, Purchasing Office, 41 Perimeter
Center East, Suite 250, Dunwoody, Georgia 30346, or by e-mail to
purchasing@dunwoodyga.gov or facsimile to (678) 533-0712. Unauthorized communication by
the proposer may disqualify the proposer from consideration.

1.   PART ONE - BACKGROUND

1.1. In March 2011, the City of Dunwoody adopted its first Comprehensive Transportation Plan
     which outlines the community's transportation objectives and funding priorities. The plan
     identifies improvements to the intersection of Spalding Drive at Chamblee-Dunwoody
     Road to be a high priority project. Classified as urban minor arterials, these are key
     roadways to the City. Based on accident reports through 2009, their intersection
     experiences the second highest total crash rate and the highest injury crash rate within the
     City of Dunwoody.

     This intersection is the northern terminus of Chamblee-Dunwoody Road, which is aligned
     to Spalding Drive at a skew that is less than 45°. The current roadway layout and striping
     configuration do not appropriately distinguish the direction of travel along Spalding Road
     and have been shown to confuse unfamiliar drivers traveling south who are unable to
     determine the path of Spalding Road. The intersection is further complicated by two local
     roads, Spencer Trace and Spalding Club Court, which also tie in to this intersection for a
     total of five roadway legs.

     The goal of the project is to improve the operation and safety of the intersection. To follow
     the Transportation Master Plan, bicycle and pedestrian facilities will also be incorporated
     into the limits of the project along both sides Spalding Drive and Chamblee-Dunwoody
     Road.

     This intersection has been assessed in the past by the City of Sandy Springs. However, the
     City of Dunwoody never took an official position on the alternatives developed by Sandy
     Springs. A copy of the assessment is attached as Appendix C of this Request For Proposals
     for background information purposes.

1.2. The total project construction cost is roughly estimated to be $750,000-$1,000,000. The
     project is expected to be funded locally.

2.   PART TWO - GENERAL SCOPE OF WORK

2.2. It shall be the Consultant's responsibility to design, prepare, assemble and coordinate the
     necessary bid and construction documents to complete the project. The completed design
     must comply with all applicable local, state, and federal environmental laws and
     regulations.

2.3. The design must comply with the latest Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
     requirements

2.4. At a minimum, the latest editions and applicable addenda of the following standards shall
     be utilized for the project:

       Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) Design Policy Manual
       Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) Standards and Specifications
RFP 13-03    Page 6 of 47

RFP 13-03      Page 9 of 47



         and the resources brought to bear (including costs and/or hourly rates) should be
         provided.

5.      PART FIVE - EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS

         The City's staff will review all proposals submitted. After reviewing the proposals, staff
         may, at its discretion, invite to interview and demonstrate performance (at proposer's
         expense at the City's site) one or more of the proposers whose proposals appear to best
         meet the City's requirements. The purpose of such an interview would be for all
         proposers to elaborate upon their proposal before a recommendation for ranking of the
         proposals is made. Interview responses, and performance, along with the written
         proposal and samples (if any), will become part of proposer's submission to be evaluated
         pursuant to the evaluation criteria. The City reserves the right to short-list proposers for
         further consideration.

  5.1    The City, in its discretion, may award the Contract to the responsible and responsive
         proposer submitting the proposal which is deemed to be the most advantageous to the
         City, price and other factors being considered. The following are the evaluation criteria
         the City will consider in determining which proposal is most advantageous to the City:

  5.1.1 Project Understanding and Approach: Describe the consultant's understanding of the
         proposed project as described in the Request for Proposals. Demonstrate an
         understanding of the magnitude of the task, the constraints and the desired outcomes for
         the project.

  5.1.2 Scope of Work: Include sufficient detail to determine how each task shall be
        accomplished. The work plan will describe how the consultant proposes to complete the
        project. The work plan must be sufficiently detailed for staff to determine the
        effectiveness of the proposal and should spell out how this work can be performed in a
        cost effective manner.

  5.1.3 Schedule: Include a schedule for timely completion of the scope of work. Include
         information on the amount of time for each task.

     5.1.4 Project Personnel: Provide information on personnel to be assigned to this project.
           Personnel should have experience from similar projects and in fields necessary to
           complete this proposed work.

  5.1.5 Similar Experience: List and describe your firm's projects worked on in the past five
        years that best match the scope and design of this project. Identify unique constraints or
        challenges associated with those projects and how you addressed those in order to deliver
        a successful project. The City may request samples of comparable work during the
        proposal review process.

  5.1.6 Pricing: After consideration of the above criteria, the value of each proposal will be
        compared against the other qualified proposals. The City is more interested in obtaining
RFP 13-03     Page 10 of 47



       proposals that provide good value, demonstrate an understanding of the city's needs and
       provide a scope that meets or exceeds the requirements of this RFP than proposals that
       have scopes tailored to fit within the stated budget

5.2   The evaluation criteria do not have any specific predetermined relative weight, nor will a
      weighing scale be developed at a later date. The consideration of individual criterion is
      merely a tool to assist the City in determining which Proposal is most advantageous, as a
      whole, to the City, price and other factors being considered. The relative advantages of a
      Proposer's responses with respect to one criterion may outweigh shortcomings of that
      Proposer's responses in one or more other criterion, depending on the relative disparities in
      the qualities of the responses in each criterion and the relative importance of certain criteria
      to each other, as determined in the exclusive discretion of the City.

notice to the Consultant of the Consultant's default in the performance of any term of this agreement.
Such termination shall be without prejudice to any of the City's rights or remedies by law.

INSTRUCTIONS TO PROPOSERS
1. INTENT
It is the intent of these Instructions to establish guidelines for the proper completion of the
Proposal Forms. These Instructions to Proposers provide guidance and explanation for
subsequent Proposal Forms and Contract Documents. Please read all Instruction paragraphs.

2. GENERAL
2.1 The City's goal is that all the terms and conditions stated in the Proposal Documents will
constitute the terms of the final Contract between the City and the successful Proposer, without
significant or material change to such terms or conditions. Exceptions to any of the terms of the
agreement to which a Proposer will not or does not agree must be presented by the proposer in
writing as provided in this section and directed to: purchasing@dunwoodyga.gov. Such
exceptions must be specific, and the Proposer must state a reason for each exception and propose
alternative language, if appropriate. The purpose of the exception process is to permit the City to
correct, prior to the opening of the proposals, any technical or contractual requirement,
provision, ambiguity or conflict in the solicitation and related documents, which may be
unlawful, improvident, unduly restrictive of competition or otherwise inappropriate. Any
corrections will be made via an addendum issued prior to the submission deadline. Unless timely
submitted as an exception and amended with an addendum, any such ambiguity, conflict or
problem shall be resolved in favor of the City of Dunwoody. Proposers shall not substitute entire
agreements or sets of terms and conditions but discuss separately each term or condition that
they take exception to or desire to change.

2.2 The Contract work shall not be divisible, and shall be awarded, if an award is made, to a
single Proposer. The City will award only one contract for the services required under this
solicitation. If the successful Proposer intends to provide any services through another company,
the successful Proposer must serve as the City's prime Contractor and shall have full
responsibility to the City for all obligations under the Contract.

2.3 A Proposer's Proposal prices shall remain firm for 180 days from the submission deadline.
Any anticipated increases in Proposer's costs during the initial term of the Contract must be
reflected in its prices set forth in its Proposal. The City shall not be obligated to renegotiate or
increase any price for any work during the initial term of the Contract based on a Proposer's
mistake or miscalculation of prices, underestimation of costs, or for any other reason. All of the
Proposer's overhead costs, including, but not limited to, costs of travel and the required bonds
and insurance coverage, shall be included in such Proposer's prices listed in its Proposal.

2.4 The Contract, if awarded, shall not be construed to create unto the Contractor any exclusive
rights with respect to any of the City's requirements. The City may in its sole discretion award
any additional or similar services to any third party, or if the Contract is for the provision of
services, the City may elect to perform all or a portion of the services by its own employees.

2.5 There shall be no reimbursables or travel expenses associated with this project regarding any
category or term. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all of the Proposer's overhead
costs related to travel shall be included in such Proposer's prices in its Proposal.
RFP 13-03    Page 16 of 47



2.6 The City will contract with the successful Proposer to provide services indicated in the
Specifications throughout the duration of the Contract at the price submitted. The City will not
price a contract for hourly rates.

3. ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
The City of Dunwoody is committed to environmental sustainability. The City believes we have
a unique opportunity to further expand our leadership in the area of environmentally preferable
purchasing, and through our actions, elicit changes in the marketplace. By further incorporating
environmental considerations into public purchasing, the City of Dunwoody will positively
impact human health and the environment, remove unnecessary hazards from its operations,
reduce costs and liabilities, and improve the environmental quality of the region. As such the
City encourages the incorporation of environmental sustainability into proposals.

4. EXAMINATION OF PROPOSAL/CONTRACT DOCUMENTS
All prospective Proposers shall thoroughly examine and become familiar with the Proposal
package and carefully note the items which must be submitted with the Proposal. (These
Instructions to Proposers, the Request for Proposal, the Proposal Forms, the Contract, the
General Conditions, and the Specifications are referred to herein as the "Proposal Documents" or
the "Contract Documents.") Submission of a Proposal shall constitute an acknowledgment that
the Proposer has read and understands the Proposal Documents. The failure or neglect of a
Proposer to receive or examine any Proposal Document shall in no way relieve it from any
obligations under its Proposal or the Contract. No claim for additional compensation will be
allowed which is based upon a lack of knowledge or understanding of any of the Contract
Documents or the scope of work.

5. ADDENDUM(S)-CHANGES WHILE PROPOSING
Other than during the Pre-Proposal Conference, the City shall not be required to provide to any
Proposer verbal interpretations as to the meaning of any portion of the Proposal Documents.
Requests for interpretation, clarification or correction of Proposal Documents, forms or other
material in this Proposal Package should be made in writing and delivered to the City,
Purchasing Office, 41 Perimeter Center East, Suite 250, Dunwoody, Georgia 30346, or by e-mail
to purchasing@dunwoodyga.gov or facsimile to (678)533-0712 at least five (5) business days
before the date and time announced for the Proposal opening. Any response by City to a request
by a Proposer for clarification or correction will be made in the form of a written Addendum. All
parties to whom the Proposal packages have been issued will be sent a notification of the
issuance of an Addendum either by e-mail and/or by facsimile. The Addendum may be
electronically downloaded by visiting the City web site at http://www.dunwoodyga.gov.
However, prior to submitting its response, it shall be the responsibility of each Proposer to visit
the City website to determine if addendum(s) were issued and, if so, to obtain such addendum(s).

6. PREPARATION OF PROPOSALS
6.1 Proposals shall be submitted on reproduced copies of the attached Proposal Forms including
any revised or additional Proposal Forms supplied by Addendum(s). If an award is made, the
completed Proposal Forms shall constitute a part of the Contract Documents and will be
incorporated in the final Contract between the City and the successful Proposer. All blank spaces
in the Proposal Forms should be filled in legibly and correctly in ink or type.
RFP 13-03     Page 17 of 47




6.2 All Proposals shall contain the name and business address of the individual, firm,
corporation, or other business entity submitting the Proposal and shall be subscribed by either the
individual, a general partner, a member of a member-managed LLC, a manager of a manager-
managed LLC, or an authorized officer or agent of a Corporation or business entity, and should
be properly witnessed or attested. If any officer or agent other than the signatories described in
the preceding sentence shall sign any Contract Document on behalf of the Proposer, the City
should be furnished with satisfactory evidence of such officer's or agent's authority to bind the
Proposer with respect to the contents of the subject Proposal Documents so signed by him or her.
If the Proposer is an LLC, the Proposer should submit with its Proposal its Articles of
Organization or other evidence satisfactory to the City, indicating whether the LLC is member-
managed or manager-managed, and indicating that the person executing the Proposal is
authorized to bind the LLC.

6.3 If the Proposer is a partnership, joint venture, or sole proprietorship, the City, reserves the
right to require the Proposer to submit to the City at any time the name and business address of
each owner, principal, partner, or member of the Proposer having an ownership or management
position with the Proposer.

6.4 If the Proposer is a corporation or other state-chartered business entity, the City reserves the
right to require the Proposer to submit to the City at any time, the name and business address of
each officer, director and holder of 10% or more of the stock or other ownership interests of such
corporation or other business entity. If the Proposer is a corporation, the Proposal should have
the corporate seal affixed and include the name of the State in which it was incorporated. If the
Proposer is a foreign corporation or other state-chartered business entity and is the successful
Proposer, the Proposer will be required to submit evidence prior to the execution of the Contract,
if awarded, that the corporation or other state-chartered business entity is authorized to do
business in the State of Georgia and the City. If the Proposer elects to use a fictitious name in its
Proposal, a copy of the Proposer's fictitious name registration should be provided to City.

7. PROPOSAL GUARANTY
A Proposal Guaranty shall not be required for this Contract.

8. DELIVERY OF PROPOSALS
8.1 All Proposals shall be submitted in sealed envelopes bearing on the outside the name of the
Proposer, address, and the Purchasing Proposal #. Each Proposal shall consist of (i) an executed
copy of the Proposal Form, along with all other documents or information required to be
submitted pursuant to the terms of the Proposal Documents (together, the "Proposal"). The
documents comprising the Proposal must be completed and signed on the forms provided herein,
or on exact reproductions thereof.

8.2 All Proposals shall be submitted pursuant to the terms outlined in these Instructions to
Proposers. Any Proposals received after the time and date specified in the solicitation document
for the opening of the Proposals will not be considered, but will be returned unopened.

Proposer shall have no right or claim against the City for costs, damages, loss of profits, or to
RFP 13-03     Page 18 of 47



recover such costs, damages, or expenses in the event the City exercises its right to reject any or
all Proposals or to cancel an award pursuant to a provision hereof for any reason.

8.4 Submission of a Proposal shall constitute authorization for the City and its representatives
and agents to make such copies of the Proposal or portions thereof and to distribute such copies
as may be necessary or desirable to carry out the City's objectives or requirements.

9. COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS
To ensure the proper and fair evaluation of Proposals, the City highly discourages any oral
communication initiated by a Proposer or its agent to an employee of the City evaluating or
considering the Proposal during the period of time following the issuance of the solicitation
document, the opening of Proposals and prior to the time a decision has been made with respect
to the Contract award. An appropriate Purchasing employee of the City may initiate
communication with a Proposer in order to obtain information or clarification needed to develop
a proper and accurate evaluation of the Proposal. Any communication initiated by Proposer
during evaluation should be submitted in writing and delivered to the City of Dunwoody,
Purchasing Office, 41 Perimeter Center East, Suite 250, Dunwoody, Georgia 30346, or by e-mail
to purchasing@dunwoodyga.gov or facsimile to (678) 533-0712. Unauthorized communication
by the Proposer may disqualify the Proposer from consideration.

10. WITHDRAWAL OF PROPOSALS
No Proposal may be withdrawn after it is submitted unless the Proposer makes a request in
writing and such request is confirmed as received prior to the time set for opening of Proposals.
No Proposal may be withdrawn after the scheduled Proposal opening time for a period of one
hundred and eighty (180) days. Any Proposer withdrawing or attempting to withdraw its
Proposal prior to the expiration of the one hundred and eighty (180) day period shall be obligated
to reimburse the City for all its costs incurred in connection with such withdrawal or attempted
withdrawal including, without limitation, any increased costs for procuring the goods or services
from another Proposer or all costs of advertising and re-procuring the goods or services, and all
attorneys' fees, in addition to payment of City's other damages. A Proposer's submission of a
Proposal shall be deemed the Proposer's acknowledgment of and agreement to the provisions of
this Section.

11. DISQUALIFICATION OF PROPOSERS
11.1         Any of the following causes may be considered as sufficient for the disqualification
of a Proposer and the rejection of its Proposal:
11.1.1       Submission of more than one Proposal for the same work, or participation in more
than one Proposal for the same work as a partner or principal of the Proposer, by an individual,
firm, partnership or corporation, under the same or different names, or by Proposers which are
affiliates, either at the time of submittal, or at the time of award. For purposes of this section, the
term "affiliates" means firms, partnerships, corporations or other entities under common control;
11.1.2       Evidence of collusion between or among Proposers;
11.1.3       Evidence, in the opinion of the City, of Proposer(s) attempting to manipulate the
Proposal pricing for its own benefit (e.g. pricing resulting in a failure of the City's ability to
enforce the Contract or impose the remedies intended following breach by Contractor);
RFP 13-03     Page 19 of 47



11.1.4      Being in arrears on any of its existing contracts with the City or in litigation with the
City or having defaulted on a previous contract with the City;
11.1.5      Poor, defective or otherwise unsatisfactory performance of work for the City or any
other party on prior projects which, in the City's judgment and sole discretion, raises doubts as to
Proposer's ability to properly perform the work; or
11.1.6      Any other cause which, in the City's judgment and sole discretion, is sufficient to
justify disqualification of Proposer or the rejection of its Proposal.

11.2        The City has adopted a policy which addresses, among other things, the obligations of
the City's employees with respect to interest in business entities, unauthorized compensation and
acceptance of gifts. Please be aware that any act by a Proposer that could cause a City employee
to violate the policy is sufficient cause for the denial of the right of the Proposer to propose on
any contract or sell any materials, supplies, equipment, or services to the City for a period of
time that is determined by the City Manager.

12. REJECTION OF IRREGULAR PROPOSALS
A Proposal may be considered irregular and may be rejected if it is improperly executed, shows
omissions, alterations of form, additions not called for, unauthorized conditions, or limitations,
or unauthorized alternate Proposals, fails to include the proper Proposal Guaranty, Contract
references, other certificates, affidavits, statements, or information required to be included with
Proposals, including, but not limited to, the Proposer's prices, or contains other irregularities of
any kind.

13. NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD CONTRACT
Unless all Proposals are rejected, a Notice of Intent to Award is anticipated to be provided within
ninety (90) days from the opening of Proposals to the responsible and responsive Proposer
submitting the Proposal deemed to be most advantageous to the City, price and other factors
being considered. For all procurements, the City reserves the right to reject any or all Proposals
and to cancel the procurement or to solicit new Proposals.

14. RESPONSIBILITY OF PROPOSERS
14.1        City reserves the right, to aid it in determining a Proposer's responsibility, to require a
Proposer to submit such evidence of Proposer's qualifications as the City may deem necessary,
and may consider any evidence available to the City of the financial, technical, and other
qualifications and abilities of a Proposer, including past performance (experience) with the City
and others. The City shall be the final authority in the award of any and all Proposals.

14.2       All Proposers shall furnish the City with the company name, address, contact person,
and telephone number of at least three (3) entities (preferably a firm other than the City) for
which they have supplied similar services as requested in this Proposal during the past three (3)
years. The information should be submitted on the provided Contract References page with the
knowledge that the City will use the data for reference purposes. The City does check all
references and requires the Proposer to notify the reference, verify contract information, and
obtain permission from the reference before completing the form.
RFP 13-03     Page 20 of 47

Proposer must provide verifiable evidence, through references or otherwise, that the Proposer is
an individual, a firm, a corporation, or other entity that is currently employed or otherwise
engaged in providing similar services and, taking into account the activities of a related

documents and information must be furnished and the Contract Documents executed by
Proposer, and delivered to the City, before the Contract will be executed by the City.

17.2         A Proposer's failure to timely fulfill its obligations under this section shall be just
cause for withdrawal of such Notice of Intent to Award. In such case, a Notice of Intent to
Award may then be issued to the next ranked Proposer or all Proposals may be rejected and the
Contract re-advertised. In such event, the City shall be entitled to receive its damages and costs,
including, but not limited to, its attorneys' fees caused by or in connection with a Proposer's
failure to fulfill its obligations under this paragraph. A Proposer's liability for failing to timely
fulfill the obligations stated in this paragraph shall be the same as for withdrawing its Proposal
(see Section 10).

17.3       The Contract shall not be binding upon the City until it has been executed by the City
and a copy of such fully executed Contract is delivered to the Contractor. The City reserves the
right to cancel the award without liability to any Proposer at any time before the Contract has
been fully executed by the City and delivered to the Contractor. Accordingly, the Contractor is
hereby warned that it should not commence performance or incur costs or expenses in
connection with the Contract obligations until it has been delivered a final, fully executed copy
of the Contract.

for a municipality. No purchase made by any entity is qualified to be exempt other than those

consumer in connection with the fulfillment of its Contract obligations, and the City shall have
no liability for such taxes.

contractual relationship between any subcontractor and the City.

Contractor is liable to the City for acts and omissions of persons directly employed by it.

State and local laws, ordinances, codes, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the

remedies, in the City's sole discretion, result in a termination of the Contract for cause pursuant
to the termination provisions of the General Conditions.

same, after contract award. The City cannot protect proprietary data submitted in vendor
proposals unless provided for under the open records law. In the event, the proposer deems
certain information to be exempt from the disclosure requirements, the proposal must specify
what content is considered exempt and site the applicable provision of the law to support that
assessment. In the event such information is requested under the open records law, the proposer's
assessment will be examined by the City Attorney who will make a determination. The decision
to withhold or release the information will be at the City's sole discretion.

indemnification obligation of the Contractor under this Section 14 shall not be limited in any

for the Contractor or any subcontractor under Workers' Compensation Acts, disability benefit
acts or other employee benefit acts.

all solicitations either by competitive proposing or negotiation made by the Contractor for work

each potential subcontractor or supplier shall be notified by the Contractor of the Contractor's
obligations under this Contract and the Regulations relative to nondiscrimination on the grounds
of race, color or national origin.

22.1.4     Information and Reports. The Contractor shall provide all information and reports
required by the Regulations or directives issued pursuant thereto and shall permit access to its
books, records, accounts, other sources or information, and its facilities as may be determined by
the City to be pertinent to ascertain compliance with such Regulations, orders and instructions.
Where any information required of the Contractor is in the exclusive possession of another who
fails or refuses to furnish this information, the Contractor shall so certify to the City, as
appropriate, and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.

direct as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance. Provided,
however, that in the event the Contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation
with a subcontractor or supplier as a result of such direction, the Contractor may request the City
to enter into such litigation to protect the interest of the City and, in addition, the Contractor may
request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.

22.2       The Contractor assures the City that it will comply with the pertinent statutes,
Executive Orders and such rules as are promulgated to assure that no person shall, on the
grounds of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, marital status, or handicap be excluded
from participating in any activity conducted with or benefiting from Federal assistance. This
provision shall bind the Contractor from the period beginning with the initial solicitation through

Contractor shall not be relieved of any obligation hereunder on account of its failure to perform
by reason of any strike, lockout, or other labor disturbance.

24.9        If the City shall, without any fault, be made a party to any litigation commenced
between the Contractor and a third party arising out of the Contractor's operations and activities
at the premises, then the Contractor shall pay all costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by
or imposed upon the City in connection with such litigation for all trial and appellate
proceedings. The City shall give prompt notice to the Contractor of any claim or suit instituted

expenses incurred in enforcing the provisions of this Contract including, but not limited to, (1)

24.12       The Contractor shall be required, during the term of the Contract, at no additional cost
to the City, to take such reasonable security precautions with respect to its operations at City Hall

all regulations, rules and policies of any governmental authority, including the City, relating to
security issues.

24.13       The City may, but shall not be obligated to, cure, at any time, upon five (5) days
written notice to the Contractor (provided, however, that in any emergency situation the City
shall be required to give only such notice as is reasonable in light of all the circumstances), any
default by the Contractor under this Contract; whenever the City so cures a default by the
Contractor, all costs and expenses incurred by the City in curing the default, including, but not
limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, shall be paid by the Contractor to the City on demand.

24.14      The City shall, in its discretion, be entitled to deduct from the compensation to which

twenty-four (24) hours by the City Manager, in his or her exclusive discretion.

24.15       The Contractor is an independent contractor and nothing contained herein shall be
construed as making the Contractor an employee, agent, partner or legal representative of the
City for any purpose whatsoever. The Contractor acknowledges that it does not have any
authority to incur any obligations or responsibilities on behalf of the City, and agrees not to hold
itself out as having any such authority. Nothing contained in this Contract shall be construed to
create a joint employer relationship between the City and the Contractor with respect to any
employee of the Contractor or of its subcontractors.

24.16       The Contractor and its subcontractors, if any, shall maintain complete and accurate
books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently
applied, and shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the City Manager or designee. The
Contractor and its subcontractors shall account for all expenses of any nature related to
transactions in connection with this Contract in a manner which segregates in detail those
transactions from other transactions of the Contractor and subcontractors and which support the
amounts reported and/or invoiced to the City. At a minimum, the Contractor's and
subcontractor's accounting for such expenses and transactions shall include such records in the
form of electronic media compatible with or convertible to a format compatible with computers
utilized by the City at its offices; a computer run hard copy; or legible microfilm or microfiche,

review of the general input, processing, and output controls of information systems, using read
RFP 13-03     Page 46 of 47



only access, for all computerized applications used to record financial transactions and
information. The Contractor and subcontractor shall freely lend its own assistance in a timely
manner in making such inspection, examination, audit, or copying and, if such records are
maintained in electronic and other machine readable format, shall provide the City and/or its
representative such assistance as may be required to allow complete access to such records. The
City Manager may require the Contractor and subcontractors to provide other records the City
Manager, in his or her sole discretion, deems necessary to enable the City to perform an accurate
inspection, examination or audit of expenses incurred in and transactions related to performance
of this Contract. Such records shall be provided within thirty (30) days of request thereof. In the
event that expenses incurred or reimbursed are found by such inspection, examination, or audit to
have been overpaid, the Contractor and its subcontractors agree that such amounts shall be
payable to the City. If, prior to the expiration of the above-stated four (4) year record retention
period, any audit or investigation is commenced by the City, or any claim is made or litigation
commenced relating to this Contract by the City, the Contractor, or a third party, the Contractor
shall continue to maintain all such records, and the City shall continue to have the right to inspect
such records in the manner stated above, until the inspection, examination, audit, claim, or
litigation is finally resolved (including the determination of any and all appeals or the expiration
of time for an appeal). This provision shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this
Contract. In the event of any conflict between any provision of this Contract and generally
accepted accounting principles or generally accepted auditing standards, the provisions of this
Contract shall control even where this Contract references such provisions or standards. In
particular, without limitation, the Contractor and subcontractors shall maintain all records
required under this Contract to the full extent required hereunder, even if some or all such
records would not be required under such generally accepted accounting principles or auditing
standards. If as a result of an inspection, examination or audit, it is established that amounts are
due from the Contractor to the City, the Contractor shall forthwith, upon written demand from
the City, pay the City such amount, together with interest on the amount due at the rate of
eighteen (18%) percent per annum, or if less, the maximum rate of interest allowed by law, from
the date such additional amounts were overpaid by the City. Further if such inspection,
examination or audit establishes that the Contractor has over billed such amounts for any
Contract period by two (2%) percent or more, then the entire expense of such inspection,
examination or audit shall be paid by the Contractor.

24.17       The Contractor and subcontractors shall prepare and provide the City with all detailed
reports as required under the Contract on a timely basis. The City reserves the right to modify the
reporting procedures or the form and content of any report as it deems necessary.

24.18      There are no third party beneficiaries to this Contract and nothing contained herein
shall be construed to create such.

24.19      Time is of the essence for the performance of each of the Contractor's obligations
under this Contract.

24.20      In computing any period of time established under this Contract, except as otherwise
specified herein the word "days," when referring to a period of time that is ten (10) days or less
means business days, and when referring to a period of time that is more than ten (10) days
RFP 13-03     Page 47 of 47



means calendar days. The day of the event, from which the designated period of time begins to
run shall not be included. A business day is any day other than Saturday, Sunday, or Federal,
State of Georgia or City holidays.

24.21     The Contractor agrees to perform all acts and execute all supplementary instruments
or documents which may be reasonably necessary to carry out or complete the transaction(s)
contemplated by this Contract.

24.22       The City reserves the right to further develop, improve, repair and alter the facilities
and all roadways, and parking areas, as it may reasonably see fit, free from any and all liability to
the Contractor for loss of business or damages of any nature whatsoever to the Contractor
occasioned during the making of such improvements, repairs, alterations and additions,
including, but not limited to, any damages resulting from negligence of the City or its employees,
agents or contractors.

24.23       The Contractor and the City hereby mutually waive any claim against each other and
their respective members, officials, officers, agents and employees for damages (including
damages for loss of anticipated profits) caused by any suit or proceedings brought by either of
them or by any third party directly or indirectly attacking the validity of this Contract or any part
thereof, or any addendum or amendment hereto, or the manner in which this Contract was
solicited, awarded or negotiated, or arising out of any judgment or award in any suit or
proceeding declaring this Contract, or any addendum or amendment hereto, null, void or
voidable or delaying the same, or any part thereof, from being carried out.

24.24      At the option of the Contractor, the products and/or services provided under the
Contract resulting from this solicitation may be provided to other governmental agencies,
including the State of Georgia, its agencies, political subdivisions, counties and cities under the
same terms and conditions, including price, as such products and/or services are provided under
this Contract. Each governmental agency allowed by the Contractor to purchase products and/or
services in connection with this Contract shall do so independent of the City or any other
governmental entity. Each agency shall be responsible for its own purchases and shall be liable
only for goods and services ordered, received and accepted by it. The City shall have no liability
to the Contractor or any governmental agency resulting from the purchase by that agency of
products and/or services from the Contractor in connection with this Contract.

24.25       Contractor must adhere to the City's Travel Policy.

Spalding Dr @ Chamblee-Dunwoody Rd ­ Spender Tr ­ Spalding Club Ct




Executive Summary

The intersection of Spalding Drive with Chamblee-Dunwoody Road, Spender Trace, and
Spalding Club Court has some significant challenges. Citizens of both the City of Dunwoody and
the City of Sandy Springs have expressed concerns about the safety of the southbound left turn
from Spalding Drive onto Chamblee-Dunwoody Road.

Several alternatives have been evaluated to improve the safety of the intersection. As outlined
in the study below, diverting the traffic to another intersection and closing Chamblee-Dunwoody
Road (Alternative F) should provide the most benefit for the cost. Providing a southbound left
turn signal phase (Alternative C) is the next most cost effective option, but does not fully resolve
the southbound left turn concerns.

Overview

This intersection is currently a five-leg signalized intersection. Spalding Drive is the main street
and the two neighborhood streets are split phased from one another. Chamblee-Dunwoody
Road operates as an exclusive phase. This intersection has no turn lanes or pedestrian
facilities.

The intersection operates in a less than optimal fashion. The split phase operation on the
neighborhood streets introduces delay which is particularly realized when there are detection
failures. The southbound left turn from Spalding Drive to Chamblee-Dunwoody Rd has no left
turn lane and tight visibility. Modifications are worth considering for the benefit of both the Cities
of Dunwoody and Sandy Springs.
         APPENDIX C- SANDY SPRINGS' STAFF OPERATIONAL ASSESSMENT

Options Under Consideration

We are reviewing many different options for this location as follows:

   1.   Existing Conditions
   2.   ALT A: Removal of the neighborhood split-phase operation
   3.   ALT B: Split-phase operation for Spalding Dr
   4.   ALT C: Left turn phase on Spalding Dr without left turn lane
   5.   ALT D: Left turn phase on Spalding Dr with left turn lane
   6.   ALT E: Roundabout
   7.   ALT F: Road closure and diversion of traffic to Auden
   8.   ALT G: Regrade hills to provide greater sight distance

Both morning and evening peak hours were analyzed.

General Considerations

Pedestrian facilities should be considered with any significant modifications to this intersection.
There are currently no pedestrian crossing facilities at this location.

The current cabinet and controller would allow us to accommodate any of the considered
upgrades to the signalized operation.
ALT A: Removal of the neighborhood split-phase operation

It would be worth considering making the neighborhood streets run concurrently, particularly if
pedestrian facilities are to be installed in the near future. The neighborhood streets align fairly
well, and visibility to the other neighborhood is clear and in a good cone of visibility. If these side
streets are changed from split-phase operation to run concurrently, a "left turn yield on green
ball" sign should be considered for each approach. Putting these together would not provide us
a large operational benefit without the consideration of providing time for pedestrians to cross. I
would not recommend this improvement alone, as many customers are not likely to realize the
benefit. However, this split-phase removal should be implemented with every retiming
consideration.

ALT B: Split-phase operation for Spalding Dr

This option considers the removal of the neighborhood split phase operation while splitting the
operation of northbound and southbound Spalding Drive. The signal would serve Chamblee-
Dunwoody Road, then Spalding Dr northbound, the Spalding Dr southbound, then the
neighborhood streets. This corrects the concerns about conflicts with the southbound left turning
vehicles at the cost of efficiency derived from concurrent operation.

ALT C: Left turn phase on Spalding Dr without left turn lane
ALT D: Left turn phase on Spalding Dr with left turn lane

With regards to the southbound left turn from Spalding Dr to Chamblee-Dunwoody Rd, we have
several options. Installing a "left turn yield on green ball" sign would provide some guidance, but
may not resolve the larger issues. Installation of a left turn phase would help operations in the
evening peak hour and remove some of the left turners from conflict. However, installation of
this phase without a left turn lane suppresses much of the benefit. It would operate similar to the
split phase while allowing some concurrent operation. The benefit is diminished by southbound
         APPENDIX C- SANDY SPRINGS' STAFF OPERATIONAL ASSESSMENT

left turning vehicles arriving after the arrow has finished serving. It would be safer that the
current condition, but not necessarily operate better. It would be less safe than the split-phase
operation, but likely operate better.

Construction of a left turn lane in addition to the left turn phase was considered. This option
would provide greater operational benefit than ALT C, but would require some right of way and
easement acquisition.

ALT E: Roundabout




Another construction option for this intersection is a roundabout. The right of way requirements
would likely have a similar impact as the left turn lane solutions and would provide a better level
of service and good safety performance.

ALT F: Road closure and diversion of traffic to Auden

A larger solution would remove Chamblee-Dunwoody from the intersection and redirect the
traffic to the next intersection to the west (Auden Trl and Dunwoody Rd). A traffic shift of this
nature would require coordination between Sandy Springs and Dunwoody. Sight distances will
need to be considered at all impacted intersections and corrected as feasible.

This alternative would relocate the traffic signal from the Dunwoody intersection and relocate it
to the Sandy Springs intersection. The Auden Trl intersection leaves much to be desired (with
"Vehicle Approaching when Flashing" beacons due to substandard sight distance), which would
be mitigated through the installation of a traffic signal. This conversion takes us from one
signalized five-leg intersection and a partially signalized four-leg signal to one signalized four-
leg intersection and one unsignalized four-leg intersection.

Chamblee-Dunwoody Road could be closed back to Oakpointe Place, and the remainder of the
road could be converted to a pedestrian area or a pocket park. Sight distances out of Spender
Tr and Spalding Club Ct should be adequate to be converted to side street stop control. Impact
         APPENDIX C- SANDY SPRINGS' STAFF OPERATIONAL ASSESSMENT

to Spender Tr would be low, as all the residents of that neighborhood would still have access to
a signalized intersection at Auden Trail. Spalding Club Ct would no longer have access to a
signalized intersection, but delay should not significantly increase. The overall delay on
Spalding Club Ct should be a wash, as the ability to find gaps should be good and the signal
delay will be removed.




Minor adjustments may need to be made to the intersection of Dunwoody Road and Chamblee-
Dunwoody Road, particularly with pavement markings to redirect the primary flow of traffic.
Alternately, minor alignment changes could be made to bring the former main street into more of
a side-street configuration.

Road renaming could also be considered. Dunwoody Road could be renamed Chamblee-
Dunwoody Road, and the segment of Chamblee Dunwoody Road north of Dunwoody Road
could be renamed Oakpointe Place.

The only road access to Chamblee Dunwoody Road between Spalding Dr and Dunwoody Rd is
Oakpointe Place. There are no driveways on this segment. No roads and a single property
access Dunwoody Road between Spalding Drive and Chamblee-Dunwoody Rd.

ALT G: Regrade hills to provide greater sight distance

If the vertical curves in the road were regraded, adequate sight distance should be attainable so
that southbound left turning drivers can determine adequate gaps. Regrading alone will not
provide significant operational benefits, so it would be worth considering other construction
options, such as a left turn lane on Spalding Drive concurrent to this work. The incremental
additional cost would be worthwhile to bundle with the land acquisition and regrading work.

For analysis purposed, the side street split phase was removed, but no additional lanes were
constructed.

Operational Analysis

Synchro was used to evaluate the operation of each of the alternatives with the methodology set
forth in the Highway Capacity Manual. Each alternative was optimized so that the operational
comparison is as fair as possible. The table includes Level of Service (LOS) as well as volume
to capacity ratios (v/c).

                Scenario                 AM LOS       v/c      PM LOS       v/c
                Existing Conditions        B          0.72       B          0.74

                ALT B: Split-phase         F          4.36       D          0.88
                ALT C: Left turn phase     B          0.69       B          0.67
                ALT D: Left turn lane      B          0.57       B          0.64
                ALT E: Roundabout          D*         0.59       D*         0.42
                ALT F: Traffic diversion   B          0.87       B          0.79
                ALT G: Regrading           B          0.71       B          0.68

Alternative E data on the table should be used with caution, as roundabouts and traffic signals
are evaluated for operation based on different criteria. Volume to capacity ratios were included
to assist with a comparison, but the letter grades are estimates using a methodology other than
that published in the HCM. Alternative F shows the signalized operation of the new signalized
intersection of Auden Trail ­ Dunwoody Road. The unsignalized intersection of Spalding Club Ct
and Spender Trace would operate at an overall level of service A, with insignificant delays on
the neighborhood streets.

Comparative Analysis

This table identifies the safety benefit of the southbound left turn and crosses it with the
operational benefit and the construction needs.

ALT G: Regrading           Minor Benefit        Major                High      Land + Easem't

The four options that fully correct the southbound left turn problem are alternatives B, E, F, and
G. The only option not recommended for operational reasons is alternative B; the remaining
alternatives are better or not significantly worse. Alternatives D, E, F, and G require significant
construction, but alternative F should not require any land or easements.

Alternative F should provide the most benefit for the cost. Alternative C is the next most cost
effective option, but does not fully resolve the southbound left turn concerns.

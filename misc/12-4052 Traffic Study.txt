INTRODUCTION   Peters & Associates Engineers, Inc., has conducted a traffic
               engineering study relating to Park Green, a proposed ap-
               proximate 656 bed residential student apartment develop-
               ment in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Park Green is proposed to
               be located approximately 600 feet south of Martin Luther
               King Jr. Boulevard (also Sixth Street and Highway 180) at
               the south end of Paris Avenue, on the south side of Rochier
               Street. A reduced copy of the site plan is included in the Ap-
               pendix for reference.

               This is a report of methodology and findings relating to a
               traffic engineering study undertaken to:

               ·   Evaluate existing traffic conditions at the traffic signal
                   controlled intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Boule-
                   vard and Garland Avenue / Paris Avenue. Garland Ave-
                   nue is the north leg of this intersection.

               ·   Determine projected traffic volumes entering and exiting
                   the proposed development at the nearby study intersec-
                   tion and the main access drive (Drive A) intersection
                   proposed to serve the site for projected analysis condi-
                   tions.

               ·   Identify the effects on traffic operations for existing traf-
                   fic in combination with site-generated traffic associated
                   with the development as proposed.

               ·   Evaluate traffic operations for the study intersection of
                   Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Garland Avenue /
                   Paris Avenue and the new main access drive intersection
                   of Rochier Street and Paris Avenue / Drive A proposed
                   to serve the site and make recommendations for mitiga-
                   tive improvements which may be necessary and appro-
                   priate for acceptable traffic operations.

               In the following sections of this traffic study report are traf-
               fic data, study methods, findings and recommendations. The
               study is technical in nature. Analysis techniques employed

                                                                    Page 1
           are those most commonly used in the traffic engineering pro-
           fession for traffic impact analysis. Certain data and calcula-
           tions relative to traffic operational analysis are referenced in
           the report. Complete calculations and data are included in the
           Appendix of the report.



THE SITE   The proposed development is on a vacant tract within the
           city limits of Fayetteville in Washington County, Arkansas.
           Park Green is proposed to be located approximately 600 feet
           south of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (also Sixth Street
           and Highway 180) at the south end of Paris Avenue, on the
           south side of Rochier Street. The proposed development site
           location and vicinity are shown on Figures 1 and 2, which
           follow.

           Access to Park Green will be provided via three proposed
           access drives intersecting Rochier Street. The middle site
           access drive (Drive A) is proposed to serve as the south leg
           of the existing intersection of Paris Avenue and Rochier
           Street, approximately 600 feet south of Martin Luther King
           Jr. Boulevard. The westernmost site access drive (Drive B)
           is proposed to intersect Rochier Street approximately 450
           feet west of Paris Avenue / Drive A. The easternmost site
           access drive is proposed to intersect Rochier Street approxi-
           mately 200 feet east of Paris Avenue / Drive A. All three
           access drives are proposed to consist of an outbound lane
           and an inbound lane.

           This development, as shown on the attached site plan, calls
           for the construction of the residential buildings, parking and
           access drives proposed to serve the site.

PROJECTIONS           (ITE) and The Trip Generation Software (Version 6 by Mi-
                      crotrans), were utilized in calculating the magnitude of traf-
                      fic volumes expected to be generated by the proposed land-
                      use of Park Green development. These are reliable sources
                      for this information and are universally used in the traffic
                      engineering profession.

                      Using the selected trip generation rates, calculations were
                      made as a part of this study to provide a reliable estimate of
                      traffic volumes that can be expected to be associated with the
                      development as proposed. Applying the appropriate trip-
                      generation rates to the land use proposed for the develop-
                      ment makes these calculations. Results of these calculation
                      are summarized on Table 1, "Park Green - Summary of Trip-
                      Generation."

                      Since Park Green is proposed to house primarily University
                      of Arkansas students, the number of residents is typically
                      used as the trip-generation independent variable
                      (approximately 656 beds or residents) for this type of land-
                      use. Additionally, since this development will consist pri-
                      marily of student housing, it is assumed that a large number
                      of these residents will utilize public transit or walk/bike to
                      campus destinations in reasonable close proximity. This site
                      is along the existing Razorback Transit route.

                      A study at Auburn University was conducted (by others) to
                      determine an estimate of reduction in vehicular trip-
                      generation reasonable to expect for pedestrian and transit
                      usage when housing is intended primarily for students and
                      has access to the public transit. This provides a reduction
                      factor to apply to estimates of vehicle traffic entering and
                      exiting the development during AM and PM peak traffic
                      times. A copy of this study is included in the Appendix of
                      this report for reference. It was found in the referenced Au-
                      burn University study that there is an approximate 40 percent
                      reduction in vehicle traffic during the AM peak hour and an

TRAFFIC VOLUME   Once projected traffic was estimated for the site, directional
ASSIGNMENTS      distributions were made to reflect the percent of left and
                 right-turns at the study intersections and site access drives.
                 Directional distribution percentages used in this report are
                 shown on Figure 4, "Directional Distribution - Site Traffic."
                 The directional distribution percentages for the site have
                 been equated to percentage turns for each movement at the
                 study intersections. These values are shown on:

                 ·   Figure 5, "Entering Traffic Percentage Turns"
                 ·   Figure 6, "Exiting Traffic Percentage Turns."

                 The projected traffic volumes shown on Figure 7, "Site-
                 Generated Traffic Volumes - AM and PM Peak Hours," and
                 on Figure 7A, "Site-Generated Traffic Volumes - School PM
                 Peak Hour," result from applying the projected entering and
                 exiting percentages shown on Figures 5 and 6 to the corre-
                 sponding projected site-generated traffic volumes summa-
                 rized on Table 1, "Park Green - Summary of Trip-
                 Generation."

                 The site-generated traffic volumes shown on Figures 7 and
                 7A and existing background traffic volumes shown on Fig-
                 ures 3 and 3A have been combined and the results are de-
                 picted on Figure 8, "Projected Traffic Volumes - AM and
                 PM Peak Hours," and Figure 8A, "Projected Traffic Vol-
                 umes - School PM Peak Hour."

                 Traffic volumes shown on Figures 8 and 8A are the values
                 used in capacity and level of service calculations conducted
                 as a part of this study for projected traffic conditions. The
                 effect of existing background traffic (i.e. the adjacent street
                 non-site traffic which exists) and projected traffic associated
                 with the developments has thus been accounted for in this
                 analysis.




                                                                    Page 10
CAPACITY and       Generally, the "capacity" of a street is a measure of its ability
LEVEL OF SERVICE   to accommodate a certain magnitude of moving vehicles. It
                   is a rate as opposed to a quantity, measured in terms of vehi-
                   cles per hour. More specifically, street capacity refers to the
                   maximum number of vehicles that a street element (e.g. an
                   intersection) can be expected to accommodate in a given
                   time period under the prevailing roadway and traffic condi-
                   tions.

                   The measure of operation of intersections is the average
                   length of time an approaching vehicle is delayed before it
                   can proceed through an intersection when compared to free
                   flowing conditions. The delay is measured in seconds per
                   vehicle. Intersection Level of Service (LOS) is represented
                   by the letter grades A (best) through F (worst). The LOS at
                   an intersection as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual
                   is shown in the following table:




                   Traffic operational calculations were performed as a part of
                   this study for traffic operating conditions of existing and pro-
                   jected traffic for the study intersections. This analysis was
                   performed using Synchro Version 6, 2003. This computer
                   program has been proven to be reliable when used to analyze
                   capacity and levels of traffic service under various operating
                   conditions. Detailed results for all capacity calculations are
                   included in the Appendix. The adjacent street AM, school
                   PM and typical PM peak traffic periods were used for these
                   calculations. Factors included in the analysis are as follows:

FINDINGS and      Findings of this study are summarized as follows:
RECOMMENDATIONS
                  ·   Approximately 1,520 vehicle trips (combined in and out) per
                      average weekday are projected to be generated by the proposed
                      residential student housing land use on this site. Of this total,
                      approximately 109 vehicle trips are estimated during the traffic
                      conditions of the AM peak hour, approximately 122 vehicle trips
                      are estimated during the traffic conditions of the school PM peak
                      hour and approximately 212 vehicle trips are estimated during
                      the traffic conditions of the PM peak hour.

                  ·   Capacity and LOS analysis results for existing traffic conditions

                      movements for existing traffic conditions at the study intersec-
                      tion presently operate at what calculates as an acceptable LOS
                      "C" or better for the AM, school PM and typical PM peak hours.

                      fic conditions for the AM, school PM and typical PM peak hours
                      for the study intersections indicate vehicle movements at the
                      study intersections are expected to operate at what calculates as
                      an acceptable LOS "C" or better for the worst-case AM, school
                      PM and typical PM peak hours.

                  Recommendations of this study are summarized as follows:

                  ·   It is recommended to widen Paris Avenue, south of Martin Lu-
                      ther King Jr. Boulevard to the two-lane local street standards
                      coincident with the site development.

                  ·   It is recommended to construct the site access drives along Ro-
                      chier Street to consist of an inbound lane and an outbound lane.

                  ·   The new access drive intersections along Rochier Street and
                      widening of Paris Avenue must conform City of Fayetteville de-
                      sign standards and will require approval by the City.

4.0 TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES
4.1      TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY REQUIREMENTS
The City has established Traffic Impact Study (TIS) requirements for the purpose of
ensuring that both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of traffic circulation impact on
the citizens, neighborhoods and businesses of the City are considered and properly
mitigated. Application of these standards is intended to appropriately regulate and balance
the increased traffic flow generated by development with the need to reasonably preserve
the quality of life and the environment within our community and to reasonably ensure
pedestrian and bicycle safety as alternate modes of transportation.

4.1.1    General
The transportation impact report shall identify the traffic impacts and potential problems to
be generated by a proposed use, and improvements required to insure safe ingress and
egress from a proposed development, maintain street capacity, and eliminate hazardous
conditions. The following requirements have been established for the preparation of TIS for
development proposals of all land use types. These policies exist to ensure consistent and
proper traffic planning and engineering practices are followed when land use actions are
being considered. The requirements provide a standard process, set of assumptions, set of
analytic techniques, and a presentation format to be used in the preparation of the TIS.

4.1.2    Applicability
Developers and/or property owners shall be required to conduct TIS, as described herein,
for all proposed development that meet any or all of the following:

             When traffic generated by the proposed development would cause the daily or
             peak hour traffic volumes on adjacent streets that serve as access for the
             development to exceed the limits outlined in this Manual in Section 5.0
             "Roadway Design" in Table 5.1 "Maximum Roadway Volumes by
             Classification";

             When a development proposes to access a collector or arterial roadway and the
             proposed development is larger than the thresholds shown in Table 4.1 "Traffic
             Impact Study Thresholds by Land Use". The threshold shall be determined by
             the full buildout of the project, not by individual phases of the project. If a
             developer completes a project that does not meet the threshold established in
             Table 4.1, and later either builds subsequent phases of that project or builds a
             separate project on an adjacent or contiguous parcel of land to the previous
             project, the combined development size shall be used to determine if a TIS is
             required; or

             When in the opinion of the City Engineer, significant operational deficiencies,
             capacity deficiencies, and/or safety concerns on the surrounding roadways


                                   LATEST REVISION: JUNE 10, 2010                          4-1
                                                                                4. TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES




                  and intersections currently exist or would be created as a result of the
                  development's expected project.

Developers who are proposing projects are strongly encouraged to contact the City to
discuss traffic impact requirements prior to submitting a rezoning application or
subdivision/site plans to determine the TIS requirements for each project.

4.1.3        Applicant Responsibility
The responsibility for conducting a TIS and assessing the traffic impacts associated with an
application for development approval rests with the Applicant. The assessment of these
impacts shall be contained within a TIS report as specified herein. It shall be prepared
under the supervision of, and sealed by, a licensed professional engineer in the State of
Alabama with experience in traffic engineering and transportation planning/engineering.

For all State Highways within the study area, the Applicant is required to meet the
requirements of ALDOT in addition to those of the City.

4.1.4        Capacity and Safety Issues
Development of property has a direct impact on transportation, including vehicular, transit,
bicycle, and pedestrian traffic. In order to meet capacity and safety needs as they relate to
the traffic generated from a particular land use, specific traffic circulation improvements
should be made. The goal of the TIS is to address traffic related issues that result from
development and to determine the improvements required to address and mitigate those
issues such that street maximum capacities are not exceeded and traffic and pedestrian
safety is maintained. The competing objectives of vehicular movement, pedestrians,
bicyclists, and others must be balanced in the development review process. The TIS will
provide information and guidance as plans are developed and decisions made for the
proposed development plan.

  4.1.4.1        Vehicular Traffic Improvements
  Examples of traffic capacity and safety improvements to mitigate development impacts
  include: road widening, turn lanes, deceleration lanes, intersection through lanes, traffic
  signals, stop signs, design speed adjustments, modifications to access points, roundabouts
  and other traffic calming techniques as approved by the City.

  4.1.4.2        Pedestrian Traffic Considerations and Improvements
  Examples of street conditions that promote safe, comfortable and convenient pedestrian
  environments include: short blocks; lower prevailing travel speeds; sidewalks; well-
  defined crosswalks, median refuge areas and islands at street intersections. Walkway
  tunnels and overhead structures are examples of safety improvements that afford
  maximum protection for pedestrians.

4.1.4.3   Bicycle Traffic Improvements
The addition of on-street bicycle lanes or off-street bicycle paths may be needed to achieve
connectivity between the proposed project and the existing bikeway system.

4.2      TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA
The following procedures have been established to outline the manner in which a TIS is to
be conducted in the City.

4.2.1    Scoping Meeting/Telephone Conference
A scoping meeting/telephone conference prior to the submittal of a request for rezoning or
site/development plan will be required and used to determine the study area, study
parameters and documentation requirements for conducting a TIS for specific development
proposals. The parameters determined in the scoping meeting/telephone conference
represent general agreement between the City and the Applicant's consulting engineer, but
they may not be all-inclusive. The City retains the right to require additional information
and/or analysis to complete an evaluation of the proposed development project.

The Applicant is required to contact the City to arrange for a scoping meeting/telephone
conference to discuss the TIS requirements and determine the base assumptions. It is
incumbent upon the Applicant to discuss the following:
            Previous TIS prepared for the site, if any;
            Location of the site;
            Proposed access and its relationship to adjacent properties and their existing/
            proposed access;
            Preliminary estimates of the site's trip generation and trip distribution at build-
            out;
            Identification of proposed year of build-out;
            Anticipated growth in traffic volumes between current and build-out
            conditions;
            Anticipated roadway improvements required to mitigate development impact;
            Phasing plan proposed, if any;
            Special analysis needs; and
            Other developments within the study area.

The scoping meeting/telephone conference shall conclude with the City and Applicant in
mutual agreement with regard to determining the level of detail and extent to which the TIS
will need to address each of the following:
            Study area for the impact analysis;
            Other developments within the study area;
            Existing intersection counts;
            Intersections and roadway segments to be studied in detail;
            Existing traffic volume forecasts;
            Anticipated growth in traffic from existing to build-out conditions;
            Location of the nearest bicycle and pedestrian facilities; and
            Special analysis needs (non traditional peak hour volumes for some uses,
            neighborhood impacts, access management plans, etc.).




                                  LATEST REVISION: JUNE 10, 2010                                   4-4
                                                                               4. TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES




4.2.2    Evaluation Elements
The key elements of the project TIS shall be specified by the City from the following list:
             Conformity with the transportation related policies of the City, including any
             other adopted access plans.
             Peak hour intersection and roadway level of service.
             Appropriateness of access locations;
             Location and requirements for left turn lanes or deceleration lanes at accesses
             or intersections. Taper lengths, storage length and deceleration lengths for turn
             lanes shall be designed as outlined in this Manual in Section 5.0 "Roadway
             Design";
             Sight distance evaluations and recommendations (intersection, stopping,
             passing);
             Continuity and adequacy of pedestrian and bike facilities;
             Recommended traffic control devices for intersections which may include two
             (2) way stop control, four (4) way stop control or yield signs, school flashers,
             school crossing guards, crosswalks, traffic signals or roundabouts.
             Traffic signal and stop sign warrants.
             Other items as requested by the City Engineer and agreed to in the scoping
             meeting/telephone conference.
             Neighborhood and public input issues.
             Classify streets within a development.

4.2.3    Roadway Traffic Volumes/Traffic Counts
Current morning and afternoon commuter peak hour (7-9 A.M. and 4-6 P.M.) traffic counts
as specified by the City Engineer shall be obtained for the roadways and intersections
within the study area for one (1), non-holiday Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Each
peak hour count shall be conducted over the designated hours (or as specified by the City
Engineer) and shall include fifteen (15) minute count data to clearly identify the peak hours.

Weekend counts and/or average daily counts may also be required where appropriate and
when required by the City Engineer. ALDOT Average Weekday Traffic (AWT) counts may
be used when available. Pedestrian counts and bike usage should be obtained. Vehicle
classification counts may be required.

In any case, these volumes shall be no more than one (1) year old (from the date of
application submittal). The source(s) of each of the existing traffic volumes shall be explicitly
stated (ALDOT counts, new counts by Applicant, etc.). Summaries of current traffic counts
shall be provided. The City will require counts while both Auburn University and Auburn
City Schools are in normal school operation. If this cannot be done it must be approved by
the City Engineer. The City will require the use of adjustment factors for data collected
when either of these facilities is not in operation. Adjustment factors proposed for use in any
TIS shall be submitted along with all supportive data to the City Engineer for review and


                                    LATEST REVISION: JUNE 10, 2010                                   4-5
                                                                            4. TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES




approval. If in the opinion of the City Engineer, the proposed adjustment factors will not
accurately reflect traffic conditions that would be in place during school operations, traffic
count data will not be accepted and will require collection during those periods when the
educational facilities are in operation.

In most cases, the actual completion of developments will occur at some time in the future.
As part of the TIS, an annual growth rate of adjacent roadways and intersections will be
developed. Growth rates utilized in the preparation of a TIS must be based on historical
traffic growth, use of a regional travel demand model or other methods as approved by the
City Engineer. Application of traffic growth shall be applied for buildout conditions and
other interim development levels as required and approved by the City Engineer.

4.2.4    Intersection and Approach Level of Service
As a minimum, A.M. and P.M. peak hour intersection and approach Levels of Service (LOS)
shall be determined for the existing signalized and unsignalized intersections at all study
intersections and roadways. Additional intersections should be included in the analysis
where post development conditions are considered by the City to be significant. The
analysis shall use procedures as described in the Highway Capacity Manual, latest edition.
Capacity analyses for intersections shall be based on individual approach LOS whereas
impacts on roadways shall be based on daily traffic volumes and the specific roadway
classification.

4.2.5    Trip Generation Rate
Trip generation rates utilized for conducting TIS in the City should be from the ITE Trip
Generation Manual, latest edition. When data is not available for a proposed land use or for
a land use unique to the Auburn area (University housing served by transit, etc.) is
proposed, the Applicant must conduct a local trip generation study following procedures
prescribed in the ITE Trip Generation Handbook and provide sufficient justification for the
proposed generation rate. This rate must be approved by the City Engineer prior to its use
in the TIS.

Dr. Brian Bowman, a professor at Auburn University, has conducted several studies to
determine trip generation rates based on existing off-campus student housing within the
City. The analysis included counting ingress and egress trips at existing developments and
obtaining information about the ridership of Tiger Transit service to develop rates for
student housing with transit service. The rates for apartment developments with no transit
service were derived from the same developments, based on the assumption that if no
transit service were available each transit rider would generate one (1) trip. The trip
generation rates summarized in Table 4.2 "Trip General Rates for Off-Campus Student
Apartments in Auburn" are based on previous studies from 2001 ­ 2006 and may be used as
trip generation rates for student apartment developments within the City. Trip generation
rates must be approved by the City Engineer prior to use in the TIS.

  * Trip Generation Rates based on number of beds in the Apartment development


If, in the opinion of the City Engineer, trip generation rates found in the ITE Trip Generation
Handbooik, latest edition, or other industry publications accurately reflect the trip generation
characteristics of a particular land use proposed, that trip generation rate may be used in
forecasting traffic to be generated by a development.

The ITE Trip Generation Handbook reports the weighted average rate and minimum and
maximum observed rates, in addition to fitted curve equations for the various land uses.
Typically, either the weighted average rate or the fitted curve equation is utilized. The
development intensity should be compared to the minimum and maximum values to ensure
the data falls within the range of information in the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, latest
edition. The guidance provided by the ITE Trip Generation Handbook (2004) for selecting
between the average rate and equation are summarized below.
  Use the fitted curve equation when:
                   A fitted curve equation is provided;
                   The independent variable is within the range of data; or
                   Either the data plot has at least twenty (20) points or the correlation coefficient
                   R2 is greater than or equal to 0.75, equation falls within the data cluster in the
                   plot, and standard deviation is greater than one hundred ten (110%) percent of
                   the weighted average rate.

  Use the weighted average rate when:
                   There are at least three (3) (preferably six (6)) data points;
                   The independent variable is within the range of data;
                   The standard deviation is less than or equal to one hundred ten (110%) percent
                   of the weighted average rate;
                   R2 is less than 0.75 or no equation is provided; or
                   The weighted average rate falls within the data cluster in the plot.

4.2.6        Preliminary Land Use Assumptions
The trip generation values contained in studies submitted prior to the establishment of a site
development plan shall be based on the maximum number of dwelling units permitted by
the Zoning Ordinance for the approved land uses, and/or the maximum trip generation
rates for the nonresidential development proposed land use action. When a TIS is being


                                                      LATEST REVISION: JUNE 10, 2010                                             4-7
                                                                             4. TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES




developed for a project with an established site development plan, trip generation shall be
based on actual dwelling unit counts and square footage(s) proposed on the final plan.

4.2.7    Trip Generation Table
The Applicant shall prepare a Trip Generation Table, listing at a minimum, each type of
land use within the site at build-out, the size and unit of measure for each land use, trip
generation rates (total daily traffic, A.M. and P.M. peaks), and the resultant total trips
generated.

4.2.8    Trip Distribution
The distribution of site generated traffic must be documented in the TIS. The procedures
and rationale used in determining the trip distributions for proposed developments must be
fully explained and documented. It is recommended the Applicant coordinate with the City
to establish an acceptable distribution pattern.

4.2.9    Requirements for Additional Lanes
Within the study area of a TIS, as established by agreement between the City and the
Applicant, additional lanes may be required on streets where minimum LOS are exceeded
for existing cross sections based on post development conditions. If such additional lanes
are required, as established as part of the TIS, they can include general purpose through
lanes, left turn lanes and right turn lanes. Additional lanes, when determined by a TIS and
in the opinion of the City Engineer of the need for such lanes is established, shall be
provided by the Applicant. Such improvements must be designed and constructed to City
and/or ALDOT standards. Generally, the cost of such improvements will be borne entirely
by the Applicant.

During the design phase of providing additional lanes on public streets and roadways, if it
is determined that additional right-of-way is required to construct such additional lanes, the
Applicant shall provide additional right-of-way along their property frontage as directed by
the City Engineer. If the construction of such additional lanes requires right-of-way beyond
the property frontage of the Applicant, the Applicant shall work with the City to devise a
method to provide the additional right-of-way and related roadway improvements or
modify their development plan to remove the requirement for such additional lanes.

4.2.10 Intersection Delay
An A.M. and P.M. commuter peak hour intersection LOS analysis shall be conducted for
each intersection analyzed in the TIS for existing conditions and those that reflect post
development conditions. This analysis shall be based on procedures specified in the
Highway Capacity Manual, latest edition. In those areas adjacent to or in close proximity to
City schools or Auburn University, additional peak hour analyses shall be conducted for
those afternoon hours which reflect the peaks for those facilities. The intent of this analysis
is to establish the existing and post development intersection delays and related LOS for
comparison and determination of impacts on operations.

4.2.11 Driveway Access
Site driveways shall be analyzed to determine the LOS for each access point. If a driveway
capacity analysis demonstrates a LOS of a "D" or worse, the TIS shall address this issue by
analyzing if a traffic signal is warranted or if an operational change is acceptable (such as a
turn restriction), and whether it will interfere with the adjacent street traffic.

Driveway plan concepts for a development shall be submitted to the City for approval prior
to development of construction plans. An access permit is required on those routes
maintained by ALDOT. The City shall be copied on all ALDOT permit applications within
the City and its planning jurisdiction. Because frequent curb cuts and driveways providing
access to numerous adjoining properties are an impediment to the proper functioning of
major streets, on-site circulation and cross-access agreements between lots are encouraged.
Minimum spacing of driveways and other curb cuts shall conform to the minimum
standards outlined in this Manual in Section 5.0 "Roadway Design".

4.2.12 Traffic Signals
Any traffic signals proposed for installation on City streets shall meet the minimum criteria
as outlined in the MUTCD, latest edition. A signal warrant analysis for potential signal
locations shall consist of a review of the applicable signal warrants contained in the
MUTCD. On roadways controlled by ALDOT, procedures for meeting traffic signal
warrants as established by the Department shall be followed.

Proposed and existing access points, proposed intersections, and existing intersections
effected by the land use that have any potential for traffic signalization will be reviewed and
discussed during the scoping meeting/telephone conference.                During the scoping
meeting/telephone conference, an outline of locations for signal warrant analysis will be
agreed upon. Alternatives to signalization at potential signal locations will be discussed in
the scoping meeting/telephone conference and the TIS report. The alternatives to adding
new intersections would include added access points, limited movements at access points,
frontage roads, joint use access points, roundabouts and other such designs as required
and/or approved by the City.

If any signal timing and/or phasing changes are proposed as a mitigation measure of a TIS,
an appropriate analysis of the intersection where the signal exists shall be conducted to
demonstrate the potential implications of the suggested modifications. Such modifications
to existing traffic signals shall require submittal of a request for such change with
supportive documentation of analysis and findings and shall not be undertaken without
approval from the City Engineer.

Sight distance concerns that are anticipated or observed which may impact driveway,
intersection, or roadway operation and safety need to be discussed in the TIS.
Recommendations regarding stopping sight distance, intersection sight distance, and
passing sight distance needs should be provided by the Applicant's traffic engineer for
detailing on the final development, site plan, or final construction plans. Intersection sight
distance requirements for driveways and intersections shall meet the criteria as set forth in
this Manual in Section 5.0 "Roadway Design".

4.2.13 Mitigation Thresholds and Measures
The City has determined that the daily and peak hour traffic volumes on all streets
designated as a collector, local commercial, local residential or alley shall not have a LOS
below a "C". Arterials shall not have a daily or peak hour LOS below a "D".

When a project's vehicular impacts are determined to exceed the minimum acceptable LOS
standard, the TIS shall include feasible measures which would mitigate the project's
impacts. Additionally, if the analysis included in a TIS establishes the LOS for an
intersection, intersection approach or roadway dropping one (1) level, however, not below
the minimum criteria for a specific roadway classification, mitigation will not be required. If
for any reason, the TIS illustrates the reduction in LOS for an intersection, intersection
approach or roadway dropping two (2) LOS, mitigation will be required. If the TIS indicates
the existing transportation infrastructure is operating at a LOS below the acceptable
thresholds, the TIS shall clearly indicate the traffic mitigation measures required to return
the facility to this existing LOS before the development.

An appropriate measure of traffic mitigation would be the ability of roadway, intersection
and traffic control improvements to maintain acceptable LOS for the impacted facility.
Mitigation measures include the addition of through lanes (roadway widening), left turn
lanes, right turn lanes, improved traffic control, access management and other such
measures as deemed appropriate by analysis and in accordance with the City.

4.2.14 Traffic Signal Operations Improvements
Traffic signal improvements shall include upgrading signals to include additional signal
phases and timing plans, signalization of an unsignalized intersection and/or
implementation of a coordinated traffic system. Signal improvements and/or installations
on City streets must be approved by the City Engineer. Traffic signals recommended to be
installed on ALDOT roadways shall be jointly approved by ALDOT and the City. Generally,
the cost of such improvements will be borne entirely by the Applicant.

4.2.15 Geometric Improvements
Mitigation measures, which include street widening, and other physical improvements
must be demonstrated to be physically feasible and must meet minimum City standards for
both on-site and off-site improvements. As part of the basic TIS analysis, a determination of
the need for left and right turn lanes as a result of development generated traffic should be
undertaken. The analysis techniques utilized shall include procedures and methods outlined
in this Manual in Section 5.0 "Roadway Design" or other methodologies as approved by the
City Engineer.

The needs for turn lanes and other auxiliary lanes shall be determined for each development
access and study intersection included in the TIS. The basis of design for such devices shall
be as outlined in this Manual in Section 5.0 "Roadway Design", AASHTO or ALDOT as
applicable. All proposed project entrances onto arterial and collector streets shall be
evaluated as to whether they require deceleration lanes as outlined in this Manual in Section
5.0 "Roadway Design".

4.2.16 Pedestrian/Bicycle Improvements
If high pedestrian and/or bicycle traffic is expected to be generated by a development, as
determined by the City Engineer, the TIS must consider improvements and connectivity to
existing and proposed facilities. The Highway Capacity Manual contains LOS criteria for
various pedestrian and bicycle facilities. Similar to roadways and intersections, pedestrian
and bicycle facilities shall not have a LOS below a "C". When a project's impacts are
determined to exceed the minimum acceptable LOS standard, the TIS shall include feasible
measures to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety within the study area.

4.3      TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY REPORT CONCLUSIONS
The findings of the TIS should be provided in summary format, including the identification
of any areas of significant impacts and recommended improvements/mitigation measures
to achieve the maximum volume standards for all modes.

4.3.1    Geometric Improvements
The TIS shall include recommendations for all geometric improvements such as pavement
markings, signs, adding through or turn lanes, adding project access and assorted turn lanes
and changes in medians. Sufficient dimensions/data shall be identified to facilitate review.
Anticipated right-of-way needs shall also be identified. This information shall be made
available to the project civil engineer for use in preparing engineering plans.

4.3.2    Responsibility
The TIS shall describe the location, nature and extent of all transportation improvements
required to achieve the required post development LOS within the study area. The
responsibility for implementation of the post development mitigation measures shall rest
with the Applicant.

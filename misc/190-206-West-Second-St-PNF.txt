1.0     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.1     Introduction

This Expanded Project Notification Form ("PNF") is being submitted by Triad Alpha Partners, LLC (the
"Project Proponent") in accordance with the Article 80 Large Project Review requirements of the Boston
Zoning Code. The proposal is for a multi-family residential development with 97 residential units and
4,000 square foot retail space with associated garage parking for 115 spaces to serve these uses (the
"Proposed Project").

The Project Site sits on approximately 49,751 square feet of land (five parcels) located at 181 West First
Street, 185 West First Street, 184 West Second Street, 190 West Second Street and 206 West Second Street
in the South Boston neighborhood of Boston. The Project Site is located within 0.4 miles of the Broadway
MBTA Station and within 1/2 mile to the Boston Convention Center. For purposes of this proposal, the
Project Site will be referred to as 190 West Second Street.

The Proponent will commence "Large Project Review" under Article 80 of the Code with the simultaneous
filing of a Letter of Intent to file an Expanded Project Notification Form and the Expanded PNF. The
Proponent has outreached to City agencies, neighborhood representatives and groups, elected officials, and
other interested parties over the past several months with respect to the Project. The principals of Triad
Alpha Partners LLC have attended and participated in the East & West Street Planning and Zoning process
and look forward to continuing their collaboration throughout the Article 80 review process.


1.2     Proposed Project

        1.2.1    Project Site Description and Context

        The Project Site is located in the South Boston neighborhood of Boston along 1st and 2nd Street
        with close proximity to the Seaport District. As referenced above, the Project Site is bordered by
        West 1st Street (North), C Street (East), West 2nd Street (South), and a City owned property, 174
        West Second Street and 175 West First Street (West). The parcel is 49,751 square feet of land and
        the parcels are currently owned by 184 West Second Street, LLC, 181 West First Street, LLC and
        Second 206 West, LLC. The project Site has approximately 246 feet of frontage on West 1st and
        195 feet of frontage on West 2nd Street and approximately 200 feet of frontage on C Street.

        The parcel currently contains an undistinguished two-story masonry structure (approximately
        22,000 square feet) along the eastern portion of the property and a unpaved parking area along the
        West First Street part of the parcel. The existing building appears to have no architectural
        significance.

        Directly across West 1st Street from the Project Site are commercial warehouse buildings and
        associated parking lots owned and leased by Casey & Hayes Movers, and AMRAMP Corporation.
        The block across West 2nd Street has a number of empty residential lots facing West 2nd Street, and
        three to four and one-half story high residential row houses facing West 2nd Street. To the West of
        the parcel along B Street is the Signal Building, a four story residential building housing 75
        apartments. Facing the C Street side of the Project Site is the West Square project which is in the
        process of being constructed. West Square is a four story residential building containing
        approximately 259 apartment units. Several of these structures have wood clapboard exteriors and
        several have brick and masonry exteriors.

        1.2.2    Surrounding Area

        The Project Site is located 3 blocks north of the West Broadway retail corridor, 2 blocks from
        Flaherty Park and Buckley Lee playground and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center ,
        within ½ mile of the West Broadway MBTA station. The Project Site is located in the South

190 ­ 206 West Second Street                              1                              Expanded PNF
        Boston Neighborhood of the City of Boston within the First Street Neighborhood Development
        Area (NDA).

        The MBTA Red Line Subway - Broadway Station, Bus Routes 9 and 11and 47 bus stop are
        located on West Broadway approximately 1000 feet east of the Site.

        The subway line provides frequent service to South Station (2-minute ride; a regular T-pass is
        accepted), to Park Street, to Downtown Crossing through Cambridge to Alewife, or in the other
        direction thru South Boston and Quincy to Braintree.

        The immediate area is a dense urban neighborhood with gaps in the typical fabric due to various
        degrees of demolition over the years. The existing residential buildings on West Second Street are
        3 to 4-1/2 story multi-family buildings, some of which are accented with bays. The context is
        denser to the south and east of the Site and less dense north and east of the site due to large areas
        of 1 to 2-story industrial warehouses and surface parking. Other amenities in the neighborhood
        include:

            x    Flaherty Park, a neighborhood park 0.2 miles southwest of the Project Site;
            x    Buckley Park and Playground, a neighborhood park 0.25 miles east of the Project Site;
            x    Institute of Contemporary Art and Bank of America Pavilion less than 1 mile from the
                 Project Site;
            x    The Boston Convention and Exhibition Center;
            x    The Arts for Humanity;
            x    South Boston Public Library;
            x    Various churches and schools and;
            x    The West Broadway commercial district with its many stores, restaurants and other
                 services including banks, a super market, clothing stores, theater, pharmacy, health
                 center, insurance agency, travel agency, real estate office, beauty salons and barbershops.

        The immediate site context along West Second and West First Street has seen high level new
        residential development in the last several years. This overall project offers enormous potential for
        a transit-oriented development that can take a major step in weaving back together a more
        sustainable and invigorated neighborhood.

        1.2.3    Project Description

        The Proposed Project calls for the development of 97 residential units and garage parking for 115
        spaces within the building. Six foot setbacks will be provided at West 2nd and C Streets, and a
        continuous eight foot setback along the north end of the site extending the length of West 1st
        Street. Open space for the building residents has been provided in the form of landscape areas
        within the setbacks, an interior courtyard, balconies, terraces and a roof deck. .

        The existing 2-story warehouse building will be demolished to make space for the new three story
        building, and the site will be subject to any necessary remediation.

        The parking garage, level with West 1st Street and facing the industrial side of the neighborhood,
        will be entered from West 1st Street and will accommodate approximately 115 parking spaces and
        a trash/loading zone. There is also a 4,000 square foot retail component at the corner of West 1st
        Street and C Street. In addition, a bike storage area and associated mechanical and storage spaces
        will be provided at the garage level.

        A three-story structure will be built on top of the garage with its entrance and primary accesses
        from West 2nd Street and West 1st Street. The U-shaped building will follow the setbacks of the
        property on the north, east and west streets, and create a courtyard/open air atrium in the middle of
        the property to bring light and air into the interior apartments.

        The building will be equipped with 2 elevators, a one-elevator bank at each lobby entrance on
        West 2nd Street, and a service elevator directly accessible from the West 1st Street for loading,
        trash, and tenant moving. All elevators will be accessible from the parking garage with no more
        than one required for roof deck access. The building will be equipped with addressable fire alarm
        and full sprinkler systems.

1.3     Summary of Project Impacts and Mitigation

        1.3.1    Wind Impacts

        The Project is not expected to have any adverse wind impacts on adjacent buildings or open space
        areas since the proposed building heights are consistent with the buildings within the
        neighborhood. A wind analysis therefore for the proposed Project was not conducted. The
        Proposed Project's Street Elevations are depicted clearly in Figures 3-11 and 3-12.

        1.3.2    Air Quality Impacts

        Given the proposed Project's small scale, no adverse air quality impacts are expected. The
        proximity of the overall Project Site to public transportation and within 1 mile of the Financial
        District further decreases the number of vehicle trips added to the nearby intersections. As
        discussed in Section 5.0 Transportation Component, existing bus and MBTA Commuter Rail line
        capacities are more than sufficient to handle the number of trips expected to be generated by the
        proposed Project.

        1.3.3    Noise Analysis

        The Proposed Project will not have a large-scale noise producing HVAC or other potential noise
        producing equipment. Each unit will be served by high-efficiency HVAC equipment that will fully
        comply with sound level limits set by the DEP Noise Policy and the City of Boston Noise
        Regulations at all times of the day.

        1.3.4    Shadow Impacts

        A shadow impact analysis was conducted to investigate shadow impacts from the proposed
        Project. The study tracked the sun and resulting shadow during three time periods (9:00 am, 12:00
        noon and 5:00 pm) during the vernal equinox (March 21st), summer solstice (June 21st), autumnal
        equinox (September 21st), and three time periods (9:00 am, 12:00 noon and 3:00 pm) during the
        winter solstice (December 21st).

        The shadow analysis presents new shadows from the Project, as well as shadows of the existing
        neighborhood, and illustrates the impact of the Project (see Figures 1-2 to 1-13). The analysis
        primarily focuses on the impact to the surrounding streets as no existing public spaces or major
        pedestrian areas exist adjacent to and in the vicinity of the site. New shadows from the proposed
        Project are generally limited to the streets and sidewalks surrounding the Project site. No new
        shadow is anticipated to be cast on West 2nd Street (south of the Proposed Building) except during
        June after 5:00 pm. Minimal shadow impact from the Project will fall on the fronts of neighboring
        residential buildings.

        During the vernal and autumnal equinox (March 21st and September 21st) net new shadow will
        partially extend on to the City owned lot located at 174 West Second and 175 West First Street to
        the East at 9:00 am. At noon, the shadows will extend onto West 1st Street and a portion of the
        proposed building's internal courtyard. At 5:00 pm in the afternoon, new shadow will extend
        across C Street to the east. No new shadow will be cast on existing open spaces in the vicinity of
        the Project site.

        In June, during the summer solstice, the building's new morning (9:00 am) shadows will partially
        fall across the City owned lot located at 174 West Second and 175 West First Street. At noon,
        when the sun is at its peak, shadows will be contained within a few feet of the project site. By 5:00
        pm, new shadows will reach across C Street as well as into the project's internal courtyard.

        During winter solstice (December 21st) the sun angle is at its lowest and the days are at their
        shortest. Daylight is least, and shadows are at their longest. At 9:00 am, the new shadows will

        cross West 1st Street and impact mostly the industrial buildings across the street. At noon, new
        shadows will be minimal at the two residential sides of the site (C and West 2nd Streets) and again
        cast partial shadows at the north industrial buildings. At 3:00 pm, new shadows will elongate
        across West 2nd Street. No new shadow will be cast on existing open spaces in the vicinity of the
        Project site.

        Typically, each morning the building shadow will fall over the westerly abutters and its sidewalks.
        At noon, the shadow falls across West 1St Street. As the day progresses, the shadow will cross C
        Street.

        1.3.5    Daylight Analysis

        Daylight obstruction is expected to be limited because the Proposed Project is similar in height to
        the buildings along West Second Street, and C Street. Therefore, daylight obstruction will be
        consistent with the area context and the Proposed Project should not have a significant impact on
        daylight in the area

        1.3.6    Stormwater Management and Water Quality Analysis

        The Proposed Project will not affect the water quality in the area. A Stormwater Management
        Plan (also see Section 6.4 Storm Drainage System) will be incorporated in compliance with the
        Department of Environmental Protection's Stormwater's Management Standards prior to being
        discharged on-site or into the Boston Water and Sewer Commission system. The Proposed Project
        will also meet or exceed standards as they relate to erosion control, discharge to sensitive areas,
        and operation and maintenance, to assure a proper functioning system during and post-
        construction.

        1.3.7    Geotechnical and Groundwater Impacts

        The Project's environmental and geotechnical consultant, Wadleigh & Associates and
        Geotechnical Consultants, Inc., has been selected as the environmental and geotechnical
        consultant for the 190 West Second Street project. A site specific boring program and
        accompanying environmental/geotechnical report has been completed prior to this filing, and an
        overview of the overall Project Site has been included in this document. Background information
        regarding the geotechnical characteristics of the Project Site is included in Section 4.2. No
        negative impact to groundwater is anticipated during construction of the Proposed Project.

        1.3.8    Solid and Hazardous Materials

        Section 4.3 contains information on the solid and hazardous materials located on-site. Additional
        environmental remedial work will be conducted under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan
        (MCP) at the Site accommodate this residential development. Excavated soil will require
        characterization to assess its disposition for off-site reuse, disposal, treatment or recycling in
        accordance with MADEP policy and the MCP.

        1.3.9    Construction Impacts

        Section 4.4 describes impacts likely to result from the Proposed Project's construction and steps
        that will be taken to avoid or minimize environmental and transportation-related impacts. The
        Proponent will employ a general contractor that will be responsible for developing a construction
        phasing and staging plan and for coordinating construction activities with all appropriate
        regulatory agencies. The Project's geotechnical consultant, Geotechnical Consulting, Inc., will
        provide consulting services associated with foundation design recommendations, prepare
        geotechnical specifications, and review the construction contractor's proposed procedures.

        The Project Proponent will comply with all applicable state and local regulations governing
        construction of the Proposed Project. The Project Proponent will require that the general
        contractor comply with specific mitigation measures and staging plans to minimize impacts on
        abutters.

        1.3.10   Transportation Impacts

        The Project's transportation consultant, Howard/Stein-Hudson Associates, Inc., completed a
        transportation study (see Section 5.0) for the proposed 190 West Second Street residential-use
        development in accordance with the city of Boston's Transportation Access Plan Guidelines
        (1989). Although the Boston Transportation Department (BTD) has not issued a Transportation

        Access Plan Scope, this report adheres to the general format requested by BTD. The evaluation
        includes the following:

            x    Definition and presentation of existing traffic, including roadway capacities, parking,
                 transit, pedestrian circulation, loading, and Site conditions;
            x    An evaluation of the project's long-term impacts on traffic, including roadway capacities,
                 parking, transit, pedestrian circulation, loading, and Site conditions;
            x    An evaluation of the project's short-term traffic impacts related to construction activity;
                 and
            x    Identification of appropriate measures to mitigate project impacts including but not
                 limited to roadway improvements, pedestrian amenities, a transportation demand
                 management program, and participation in Transportation Management Associations.


        1.3.11   Infrastructure Systems Component

        Section 6.0 describes the existing utility systems servicing the Project area; discusses any probable
        impacts that the Proposed Project may have on the utilities; and identifies mitigation measures to
        address potential impacts of the proposed Project.

        The Project Proponent has initiated contact with those responsible for the area's utility systems,
        including the Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) to understand and evaluate each
        system and design the Proposed Project to prevent disruption of utility services. A BWSC Site
        Plan and General Service Application is required for the proposed new water, sewer and drain
        connections. In addition, a Pollution Prevention Plan will be submitted specifying best
        management measures for protecting the BWSC drainage system during construction. A Drainage
        Discharge permit will also be required prior to discharge of any construction dewatering.

3.0      URBAN DESIGN COMPONENT

3.1      Project Description and Approximate Dimensions

The proposed as-of-right project will be a multi-family residential development to be constructed on
approximately 49,751 square feet of land located at 181 and 185 West First Street and 184, 190 and 206
West Second Street in South Boston, MA. The property has frontage on West First Street, C Street, and
West Second Street.

The existing building on the site is a two-story structure containing approximately 22,000 square feet. The
building was previously used as offices and light manufacturing but is currently being used for storage and
the yard space is currently being used for parking. The existing structure will be demolished to
accommodate the new residential project.

A 246 foot by 200 foot U shaped one story parking garage will be constructed. The parking garage will be
entered from West First Street and will accommodate approximately 115 parking spaces. The floor
elevation of the parking garage will be approximately 12" inches lower than the adjoining West First Street
elevation.

A three story structure will be built on top of the garage; an "U" shaped building creating a court yard in
the middle of the structure and a mid-block semi private garden open to West Second Street.

The planned project will consist of 104 residential units, 4,000 square foot retail space with a total of 115
parking spaces. The proposed building heights will be within the maximum heights required by zoning; on
average 45' and 35' along West 1st and West 2nd respectively. The proposed structure is designed to be at
least approximately 11 feet shorter than West Square project directly across C Street and approximately 11
feet shorter than the Signal Building located at the corner of B Street and West 2nd Street, and within the
context height of buildings along West 2nd.

The buildings will be equipped with addressable fire alarm systems and full sprinkler systems.

Approximate dimensions and unit counts are provided in Table 2.1 in the previous section.

3.2      Building Design

         3.2.1    Facade Design, Fenestration and Entrances

         The design of the three-story brick and metal clad building is compatible with the existing
         industrial and residential urban scale. It will noticeably enhance the neighborhood by
         reconnecting the gaps in the urban fabric and by infilling this portion of the block.

         Facade Design
         The building will be clad with two stories of brick on a masonry base replicating traditional brick
         masonry buildings throughout Boston. The third floor of the building has been designed with a
         metal cladding in order to vary the palette of materials and contribute toward a visually reduced
         scale. The deep roof overhang shelters the third story balconies and adds a strong horizontal effect.
         In addition, recessed third floor balconies around the building are included to break the roofline of
         the building and reduce its massing and scale fronting the streets.

         Fenestration
         The windows of the building vary along the three street elevations to relate to the context fronting
         each street. The elevations incorporate large casement windows with brick perimeter setback trim
         in the masonry facades; and floor to ceiling glass doors and fixed windows in the metal clad bays.
         The east, west, and south elevations include recessed metal panels at the windows extending
         vertically several floors to relate the various materials of the building. The north elevation will
         include protruding balconies and larger glazed openings to be more in relation with the industrial

190 ­ 206 West Second Street                               26                               Expanded PNF
        zone across West First Street. Additional storefront glazing will be incorporated on the north
        elevation street level to bring light into the garage and to create the retain element.

        Entrances
        The primary pedestrian entrance to the building is from 190 West Second Street under a canopy.
        There will be secondary pedestrian entrances to the building is from 184 West Second Street and
        181 West First Street. Along C Street there will be two entrances directly into two townhouse
        units. Vehicular access to the parking garage will be through one garage door on West First Street.
        Trash disposal, service elevator and bicycle storage access will also be from West First; as well as
        fire department access to sprinkler and electrical rooms. Storefront windows and glazed doors
        will activate the retail portion of the building along West First Street. Canopies have been
        designed above the residential and retail entrances.

        3.2.2     Floor Plans

        The residential units are a mix of one and two bedroom units. All units are flats except two which
        are townhouses; typically having the bedrooms defined and an open space living/kitchen/dining
        area. The unit sizes range from 625 square feet to 1,278 square feet with an average of 825 square
        feet. Generally, the units span from the window line of one of the facades to the double loaded
        corridor of the building. Interior facing units have access to light and air through an open atrium
        courtyard. A large number of units will have balconies and terraces to enliven the street
        elevations.

        3.3       Site Design

        3.3.1     Pedestrian Circulation

        The primary entry to the building is directly off the sidewalk of West Second Street. Voluntary
        setbacks are provided on all four sides of the building to provide clearance to neighboring
        buildings, as well as provide street trees and plantings, and seating to enhance the pedestrian
        environment.

        Accessibility has been designed into the site circulation and building by providing entrances and
        elevators at various locations around the perimeter of the Project.

        3.3.2     Open Space

        The open space designed for this development falls into either a private, semi-private, or public
        category:

              x   Private balconies and terraces
              x   Semi-private common courtyard
              x   Large building setbacks on West First, C and West Second Street.
              x   The potential for a public retail seating area along West First Street
              x   A roof deck.

        The common courtyard in the center of the building will be developed into useable open space
        with private terraces and plantings. The courtyard will also provide lighting into many units. A
        roof deck will be created on the roof level accessible to the building occupants and with
        uninterrupted views to downtown Boston.

        3.3.3    Parking and Vehicular Circulation

        Parking for all the residential units is provided in an enclosed parking garage. The vehicle access
        and egress will be onto West First Street and will satisfy all accessibility requirements.

        The garage will have 115 parking spaces with 26 tandem and 89 single parking spaces, a trash and
        recycling room, a loading zone, and a bike storage area. All three elevators will access the garage
        and residential floors.

3.4     Sustainable Design and Energy Conservation Measures

The Project Proponent is committed to the practice of sustainable design as demonstrated by both their
work with the U. S. EPA's EnergyStar program, and the BRA. The Project Team has begun the process of
integrating sustainable strategies throughout the development to minimize building energy use, reduce
emissions, and maintain safe and comfortable indoor environments. At the same time, these strategies will
also assist in reducing maintenance and management costs. The paragraphs below outline the project's
approach to sustainable design, and identify some of the principal proposed strategies.

        3.4.1    Implementation and Evaluation

        The principal instruments for the implementation and evaluation of energy efficient and
        sustainable design practices will be the EnergyStar program.

        EnergyStar
        The U. S. EPA EnergyStar program provides financial incentives and technical assistance to
        encourage the construction of energy efficient buildings, and is overseen in the Boston area by the
        Construction Services Group ("CSG") under contract with the EPA.

        In addition to consulting with the designers on insulation and ventilation strategies to improve
        building envelope performance, the CSG provides information and training to the Contractor(s) on
        means and methods of achieving airtight construction to prevent air infiltration.

        EnergyStar provides rebates for the use of certain items when specified and installed in accordance
        with EnergyStar standards, including:

                 1.         Energy efficient windows;
                 2.         High efficiency boilers and hot water storage tanks;
                 3.         Energy efficient appliances; and
                 4.         Energy efficient light fixtures.

        Perhaps most important, on completion, CSG conducts blower door tests on a number of units and
        in common areas to insure that air leakage is below an allowable maximum value. This test
        verifies that the sealing of all penetrations through exterior wall, floors and roof has been properly
        executed and that the building envelope is performing as specified.

        Sustainable Sites

        Urban Redevelopment Sanborn Maps indicate that the proposed site was previously built upon. A
        one-two story industrial building is the only structure that currently exists on the site. The
        remaining 55% of the site (about 28,000 sq ft) is a unpaved parking/storage lot. The Proposed
        Project will return this vacant site to the more vibrant density of an urban neighborhood.

        Alternative Transportation

        The MBTA Red Line Subway - Broadway Station, Bus Routes 9 and 11and 47 bus stop are
        located on West Broadway approximately 1000 feet east of the Site.

        The subway line provides frequent service to South Station (2-minute ride; a regular T-pass is
        accepted), to Park Street, to Downtown Crossing through Cambridge to Alewife, or in the other
        direction thru South Boston and Quincy to Braintree.

        Please see Section 5.2.6 for further information on buses and the commuter rail.

        The use of bicycles by building residents will be promoted by the installation of a covered, secure
        indoor bicycle storage area within the development.

190 ­ 206 West Second Street                               41                              Expanded PNF
        The Proponent is investigating the possibility of providing a ZipCar parking space at the project's
        garage facility. This ZipCar would accommodate not only the project's residents but would also
        be available to other local residents. In addition, dedicated parking spaces and plug-in charge
        stations will be provided for the use of electric vehicles, as well as preferential parking for
        alternative fuel or high efficiency vehicles.

        Stormwater Management

        The stormwater management system for the Proposed Project will increase on-site recharge and
        improve off water quality through the use of the following measures:

        x   On-site treatment of storm water collected from parking areas and other potentially hazardous
            effluent.

        Water Efficiency

        Water conservation measures that minimize both water use and wastewater production will
        include:

        x   Dual flush toilets that will reduce water usage project-wide, both in residential and non-
            residential areas.

        Energy and Atmosphere

        State-of-the art sustainable technologies and practices to be employed by the Proponent for the
        project's heating, cooling, and ventilation systems include:

        x   High-efficiency gas fired boilers;
        x   Indirect-fired, longer life domestic hot water tanks, with additional heavy insulation to save
            energy;
        x   Variable frequency drives and high-efficiency motors for circulating pumps
        x   Direct digital controls (DDC), also called energy management systems (EMS) with modem
            communication for each boiler plant;
        x   Added insulation for all piping beyond that required by Code;
        x   Carbon Dioxide sensor control for ventilation of community spaces;
        x   High-efficiency lighting that exceeds code requirements;
        x   Daylight and occupancy control options;
        x   Automated light sensing set back thermostats for apartment temperature controls;

        Material and Resources

        Storage and Collection of Recyclables
        A recycling program is planned for the proposed Project. The building will have a recycling
        transfer room within the building. This program will be coordinated with an outside vendor for
        weekly pick up.

        Construction Waste Management
        The Contractor will be required to develop and implement a Waste Management Plan with the
        goal of recycling or salvaging 75% of construction waste in order to divert construction and
        demolition debris from landfill disposal.




190 ­ 206 West Second Street                             42                               Expanded PNF
        Regional Materials
        The Project Team has established as a goal the specification and installation of materials such that
        5% of all materials used in the project will be manufactured regionally within a radius of 500
        miles.

        Indoor Environmental Quality

        Construction Indoor Air Quality Management
        The contractor will be required to develop and implement an Indoor Air Quality Management
        Plan, to prevent indoor air quality problems resulting from the construction process.

        Low-Emitting Materials
        Adhesives, sealants, paints and carpets will be specified with low/no VOC content to reduce the
        quantity of indoor air contaminants

        Daylight and Views

        The building orientation, fenestration and exterior articulation will work in concert to both
        maximize daylighting and control solar heat gain. All buildings are designed to have significant
        solar access throughout the day. Larger windows will be incorporated in the facades that best
        capture and control daylight.

        Dwelling units will have large, high windows to maximize daylighting in the living spaces.

        Residential common spaces are designed to rely largely on natural light for daytime hours.




190 ­ 206 West Second Street                              43                              Expanded PNF
4.0      ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMPONENT

This section of the PNF evaluates potential environmental impacts related to the Proposed Project in the
subject areas of water quality and stormwater management, geotechnical and groundwater conditions, solid
and hazardous waste, and construction related impacts. Since the Project Site is within the existing zoning
height allowance and is generally consistent with the residential character in the surrounding neighborhood,
the Project is not expected to have significant impact on surrounding wind patterns and pedestrian comfort
levels, or daylight impacts in the Project Site vicinity. Therefore, these specific evaluations were not
included in this PNF.

4.1      Water Quality/Stormwater Management

The project will install a subsurface stormwater infiltration system (SSI) along West First Street. Building
roof and storm drains will be directed to the SSI system with overflows being directed to the municipal
storm drain system.

The Proposed Project will not affect the water quality in the area. A Stormwater Management Plan will be
incorporated in compliance with the Department of Environmental Protection's Stormwater Management
Standards providing pretreatment of the stormwater prior to being discharged on-site or into the Boston
Water and Sewer Commission system. The Proposed Project will also meet or exceed standards as they
relate to erosion control, discharge to sensitive areas, and operation and maintenance to assure a proper
functioning system during and post-construction.

The project will yield a decrease in peak discharge rates and volumes of runoff and improve groundwater
recharge. This is accomplished primarily by installing the SSI system.

4.2      Groundwater and Geotechnical Analysis

Wadleigh & Associates and Geotechnical Consultants, Inc. have been selected as the environmental and
geotechnical consultant for the 190 West Second Street project. A site specific boring program and
accompanying environmental report was completed by Wadleigh & Associates prior to this filing.

Based upon a review of the subsurface soils data (boring logs) collected by Wadleigh & Associates, the
overall Project Site is anticipated to contain mainly underlain by glacial outwash or ablation till soils
(predominantly loose-medium dense, fine-medium sands, silts and gravels) over hard basal till. Shallow
depths to bedrock are unlikely, as refusal was encountered at depths of 64 to 68 feet during drilling
activities at the Site, and no bedrock outcrops were observed at the Project Site or within the immediate
Site vicinity.

4.3      Flood Zones and ACECS

Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the City of
Boston (Community Panel 25025C0083G, updated September 2009) was reviewed to determine if the
project site lies within the 100-year flood plain. The site falls within a Zone C, defined by FEMA as "an
area of minimal flooding." Thus, the project will not lead to an increased flood or storm damage risk.

No Areas of Critical Environmental Concern or State Certified Vernal Pools exist within the site. Likewise,
the site is not included on the list of either Priority Habitats for Stated-Listed Rare Species of the list of
Estimated Habitats for Rare Wildlife.

4.4      Solid and Hazardous Waste Analysis

The environmental releases at the Subject Property (Site) historically has been identified by two
MassDEP RTNs:



190 ­ 206 West Second Street                               44                               Expanded PNF
#3-0258                     White Fuels                 West Second & C Streets
#3-0996                     Eastern Index Corp.         206 West Second Street

The Subject Property was identified by the MassDEP as a Location to be Investigated (LTBI) in January
1987 (RTN 3-0258), based on the unresolved report of a spill of miscellaneous oil on September 14, 1984
(assigned MassDEP Spill No. N84-0614). According to the MassDEP online Searchable Site/Reportable
Release database, this RTN was closed on August 1998, when it was linked to RTN 3-0996.

On April 13, 1994, the MassDEP assigned RTN 3-0996 to "petroleum, VOCs, sludge and ash released at a
fuel depot from a fill resulting in a release to soil and a groundwater release." A Notice of Responsibility
(NOR) was issued to Ms Joan Deegan of Eastern Index Corporation, a former tenant of 206 West Second
Street. The NOR cited the Norwood Engineering (1984b) and Haley & Aldrich (1985) reports as evidence
of the release. In June 1997, MassDEP designated the Release Site as classified Default Tier 1B for lack of
response actions on the part of Responsible Parties.

In July 1998, ENSOL, Inc., on behalf of Site owner MMR Realty Trust, prepared a Phase I Initial Site
Investigation Report and Tier Classification submittal, indicating that the Release Site qualified for
classification as Tier 2. The MassDEP accepted this reclassification in August 1998.

On October 9, 1998, MMR Realty Trust received a petition from ten residents of South Boston, requesting
that the Site be designated as a Public Involvement Plan (PIP) Site, pursuant to Section 14(a) of MGL
21E and 310 CMR 40.1404. On November 6, 1998, MMR officially designated the Site as a PIP Site,
submitting a Plan for public involvement on January 29, 1999. Consistent with the MCP, the PIP called
for:

Phase II Comprehensive Site Assessment of the nature and extent of the contamination and
evaluation of the potential risks posed to the nearby public and the environment within two years
of Tier Classification (by July 2000);

Phase III Identification and Selection of Comprehensive Remedial Action Alternatives that will
achieve a permanent solution (cleanup) within two years of Tier Classification (by July 2000);

Phase IV Implementation of the Selected Remedial Action Alternative within three years of Tier
Classification (by July 2001); and

Phase V Operation, Maintenance and/or Monitoring of remedial actions and environmental
conditions at the Site within four years of Tier Classification (by July
2003);

leading to the submittal of a Response Action Outcome (RAO) Statement on or before five years after Tier
Classification (July 2003). During the course of these actions, the PIP Plan required that interested parties
be given the opportunity to comment on Site cleanup decisions and approaches. The MassDEP Northeast
Regional Office, the South Boston Public Library, and ENSOL were designated as repositories for
public access to all Site information.

ENSOL prepared a Phase II Scope of Work in February 2000. In February 2002, ENSOL requested an
extension until August 2002 for completion of the Phase II/III Investigations. In June 2003, Green
Environmental prepared an alternative Phase II Scope of Work.

Between October 30, 2003, and January 26, 2004, Action Environmental Group, Inc., doing business as Avier
Environmental and working for R.W. Crandlemere Associates on behalf of Random Financial
Corporation, conducted ASTM Phase II Environmental Site Assessments at the Subject Property to

190 ­ 206 West Second Street                               45                              Expanded PNF
evaluate the potential financial liabilities associated with acquisition of the Subject Property. The ASTM
Assessments were based partly on the Green Environmental Phase II Scope of Work. During the
assessments, eight new soil borings were drilled at the Site; three of which were converted to groundwater
monitoring wells. Supplemental ASTM Assessments were performed in February 2005 and May 2005,
during which ten additional soil borings were installed at the Site and in West First Street, eight of which
were converted to monitoring wells. First West, LLC, acquired an interest in the Site through its purchase
in February 2004 by Second West, LLC, from MMR Realty Trust; and a Tier II Transfer and Extension was
submitted by First West, LLC, on September 23, 2004, as First West, LLC, assumed responsibility for
response actions at the Site.

Avier Environmental, working for R.W. Crandlemere, LLC, on behalf of First West, LLC, submitted a Phase II
Scope of Work and Revised MCP PIP Plan for public comment on August 25, 2005. No public comment
was received, and the MassDEP logged the submittals as received on October 21, 2005. Phase II activities
were performed between November 30, 2005, and January 19, 2006 -- including the installation of five
additional borings, three of which were converted to monitoring wells; evaluation of aquifer characteristics;
and conduct of a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey to identify potential subsurface structures that could
be continuing contaminant sources.

Avier Environmental submitted the Phase II Comprehensive Site Assessment report for public
comment on June 29, 2006. No public comment was received, and the MassDEP logged the
submittal as received on August 28, 2006. The Phase II Report concluded that contaminant impact to soil
and groundwater at the Site resulted from the releases of coal tar and to a lesser degree releases of
petroleum and from urban fill originating from off-site contaminated areas. Two apparently circular
areas of suspected solid coal tar were identified by GPR south of the foundation of the former garage
building. A diffuse area of attenuation interpreted as petroleum contamination was identified by GPR as
extending under the center of the foundation slab of the former garage building. GPR The vertical extent
of contamination was identified as ranging from the surface to approximately 16 feet below grade. The
horizontal extent of contamination was identified as including most of the Subject Property and at
least to the north side of West First Street. Contaminants were identified as including volatile and
semi-volatile petroleum hydrocarbon compounds (especially naphthalene) and the metals antimony,
arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium, silver, thallium, and zinc. A supporting
Method 1 Risk Assessment determined that a Condition of No Significant Risk of harm to health,
public welfare, and the environmental did not exist at the Site. Therefore, additional Comprehensive
Remedial Actions were determined to be necessary at the Site. First West, LLC, was unable to continue
response actions at that time because of lack of funding.

On September 19, 2006, the MassDEP issued First West, LLC, Notice of Noncompliance (NON) NON-
NE-06-3C010 for failure to submit a Phase III Remedial Action Plan, a Phase IV Remedy Implementation
Plan, and a RAO in timely fashions. The NON established an interim deadline for completion of these
submittals of October 16, 2007.

Avier Environmental submitted the Phase III Remedial Action Plan report for public comment on
November 7, 2006. No public comment was received, and the MassDEP logged the submittal as received
on February 15, 2007. Separate remedial alternatives were evaluated for the coal-tar source area and for the
petroleum-impacted source area. The most cost-effective and feasible remedial action alternative was
determined to be excavation and off-site treatment/recycling (anticipated to be at different facilities for
coal tar and petroleum-impacted materials) followed by groundwater treatment by chemical oxidation.

Loss of First West, LLC's financial partner delayed implementation of the Phase III Plan until 2009. First
West, LLC, opined that additional costs associated with PIP compliance were impeding its ability to
obtain financial backing and to fund the cleanup. On July 23, 2008, Avier Environmental, at the request of
First West, LLC, notified recipients on the PIP List and the MassDEP of the intent of First West, LLC, to
terminate the PIP process for lack of interest (noting that none of the previous submittals had elicited public


190 ­ 206 West Second Street                                46                               Expanded PNF
comment and the at repositories reported no requests for document review). The notice of that intent also
was published in the newspaper with a request for comment. Upon still receiving no comment from any
party, Avier Environmental submitted a notice to the MassDEP on September 4, 2008, requesting that the
Site be removed from further PIP requirements.

On July 1, 2009, Action Boston, Inc., doing business as Action Environmental Boston, acquired the assets
of Avier Environmental and assumed project management for R.W. Crandlemere, LLC, on behalf of First
West, LLC.

On June 2, 2009, Action Environmental, working for R.W. Crandlemere, LLC, on behalf of First West,
LLC, and its new financial partners, submitted a Tier II Extension and began implementation of the Phase
III Plan. Groundwater conditions at the Site were updated during June 2009 monitoring and sampling
activities. On June 29, 2009, the MassDEP issued NON-NE-09-3C022 to First West, LLC, for failure to
submit the Phase IV Remedy Implementation Plan and RAO. The NON established an interim deadline
of July 17, 2010, for returning the Site to compliance.

On July 31, 2009, Action Environmental Boston, working for R.W. Crandlemere, LLC, on behalf of First
West, LLC, submitted a Class C-2 RAO for the Site, which included updated groundwater monitoring
data.

On July 31, 2009, Action Environmental Boston, working for R.W. Crandlemere, LLC, on behalf of First
West, LLC, also submitted a Release Abatement Measure (RAM) Plan for the Site. Pursuant to 310 CMR
40.0446, this report describes the principal elements of that Plan, documents its implementation in 2009
and 2010, and identifies how Plan objectives have been met. An intermediary RAM Status Report was
submitted to the MassDEP on January 6, 2010.

On July 15, 2010, the final requirement of NON-NE-09-3C022 was met with the submittal of a Phase IV
Remedy Implementation Plan (RIP). In July 2010 a RAM Completion Statement was submitted to
MADEP, ongoing response actions at the Site will be performed under the Phase IV RIP.

Therefore, additional environmental remedial work will be conducted under the Massachusetts Contigency
Plan (MCP) at the Site accommodate this residential development. Excavated soil will require
characterization to assess its disposition for off-site reuse, disposal, treatment or recycling in accordance
with MADEP policy and the MCP.

         4.3.1    Construction Period Waste

         The construction contractor will be required to develop and implement a Waste Management Plan
         with the goal of recycling or salvaging 75% of construction waste in order to divert construction
         and demolition debris from landfill disposal.

         4.3.2    Operational Solid Waste

         A development wide recycling program is planned for this project. Each building will have either
         a recycling transfer room within the building or an exterior recycling transfer shed. This program
         will be coordinated with an outside vendor for weekly pick-up.

         4.3.3    Recycled Materials

         The project team has established as a goal the specification and installation of materials such that
         5% of all materials used in the project will be post-consumer recycled.




190 ­ 206 West Second Street                               47                               Expanded PNF
         4.4 Construction Impacts

The following section describes impacts likely to result from the Proposed Project's construction and steps
that will be taken to avoid or minimize environmental and transportation-related impacts. The Project
Proponent will employ a general contractor that will be responsible for developing a construction phasing
and staging plan and for coordinating construction activities with all appropriate regulatory agencies. The
Project's geotechnical consultant, Geotechnical Consulting, will provide consulting services associated
with foundation design recommendations, prepare geotechnical specifications, and review the construction
contractor's proposed procedures.

The Project Proponent will comply with all applicable state and local regulations governing construction of
the proposed project. The proponent will require that the general contractor comply will specific mitigation
measures and staging plans to minimize impacts on abutters.

Proper pre-construction planning with the neighborhood will be essential to the successful construction of
this Project. The Project Proponent will convene neighborhood meetings on the subject of minimizing
adverse construction activity impacts, including at least one prior to the start of construction and at least
two during construction, and more such meetings if feedback from the neighborhood indicates the need for
them. Signage will include general contractor and Project Proponent contact information with emergency
numbers.
          4.4.1   Construction Activity Schedule

         The construction period for his project is expected to be approximately 18-24 months in duration.
         Typical construction hours will be from 7:00 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Monday through Saturday.
         Second shift construction activity is expected to be kept to a minimum.

         The general construction contractor will conduct a pre-construction survey of abutting properties.
         Construction excavation and other construction procedures are to be developed so as to assure that
         this work will not undermine or adversely affect these structures.

         4.4.2    Construction Staging Areas

         The proposed staging plan is designated to isolate the construction while providing safe access for
         pedestrians and automobiles during normal day-to-day activities and emergencies.

         Construction of 190 West Second Street project will be made easier because of the following: the
         Project Site can be accessed from any of the four adjoining streets to allow main thoroughfares to
         be maintained clear; the overall Project Site plan includes open areas outside the building
         footprints which can serve as staging areas during construction. As abutting properties and
         structures are owned by others, care will be taken to minimize construction impacts on all abutters.

         With very rare exceptions, construction vehicles well enter and exit the Project Site from gated
         entrances located along East First Street which are not major thoroughfares for the neighborhood.
         The main access point will be from East First Street. In order to minimize the impact on traffic
         flow along East Second Street, construction vehicles will enter and/or exit from East First Street
         during non-rush hour time periods.

         Gates will be provided at the construction areas to provide both entrance and exit from the overall
         Project Site. All construction activity will be kept within the overall Project Site. Appropriate
         signage will be installed along the pedestrian travel-way. The vehicular lanes on public streets
         will not be obstructed.

         Heavy trucking, such as during concrete placements, will be controlled so as not to impact the
         neighborhood around the overall Project Site more than necessary, and stacking of trucks will be
         kept to a minimum. In the event stacking of trucks does occur, such as with large concrete pours,


190 ­ 206 West Second Street                               48                              Expanded PNF
        the trucks reach the overall Project Site, they will be brought onto the site where materials will be
        off loaded.

        4.4.3    Demolition

        The current Site building (190 West Second Street) will be demolished. Access to the Project Site
        for demolition and disposal vehicles and equipment (for interior demolition debris) will be from
        the gated entrances located along East First Street.

        Demolition/construction debris will be disposed of into dumpsters and trailer dumps, which will
        be located at various locations throughout the overall Project Site. Demolition will be conducted
        so that materials that may be recycled are segregated from those materials not recyclable, to enable
        disposal at an approved solid waste facility. The Proponent will take an active role with regard to
        the processing and recycling of demolition and construction waste. The disposal contract will
        include specific requirements that will ensure that construction procedures allow for the necessary
        segregation, processing, reuse and recycling of materials. For those materials that cannot be
        recycled, solid waste will be transported in covered trucks to an approved solid waste facility, per
        DEP's Regulations for Solid Waste Facilities, 310 CMR 16.00.

        4.4.4    Excavation

        Shoring will be used during excavation to the extent required due to proximity to the sidewalk or
        abutting structures. Setbacks from most side and rear lot lines are such that there will probably be
        sufficient room to slope the sides of excavations at an angle that does not require shoring at these
        locations. Excavated material which is not to be reused on-site will be transported in covered
        trucks to an approved landfill or processing site.

        4.4.5    Dewatering

        Dewatering will be such that all construction operations are conducted in the dry. Sump pits and
        pumps will be maintained inside the limits of excavation to collect and discharge water. Operation
        of the dewatering systems will:

            x    Result in no damage to adjacent buildings, properties, structures, utilities and completed
                 work.
            x    Prevent and remove any water accumulating in the excavation.
            x    Collect and discharge surface water, seepage, groundwater, and other water which may
                 enter excavations.
            x    Develop dry undisturbed excavation subgrades for execution of subsequent construction
                 operations in the dry.
            x    Maintain and control the water level in backfill to minimum of two (2) feet below the top
                 of backfill placement and compaction operations.
            x    Maintain existing groundwater levels outside the excavation limits.

        4.4.6    Construction Waste

        Normal construction debris will be disposed of into dumpsters, which will be located at various
        locations throughout the overall Project Site.

        4.4.7    Construction Traffic Impacts

        Because the construction workers will arrive and depart prior to peak traffic periods, the
        construction trips are not expected to impact traffic conditions. The general contractor and its
        subcontractor will be required to recruit workers from the neighborhood to the maximum feasible



190 ­ 206 West Second Street                              49                               Expanded PNF
        extent. In addition to other benefits, employing workers who live nearby will reduce the number
        of personal vehicles driving to the site.

        4.4.8    Construction Air Quality

        Impacts associated with construction activities may generate fugitive dust, which will result in
        localized increase in airborne particle levels. Fugitive dust emissions from construction activities
        will depend on such factors as the properties of the emitting surfaces (e.g., moisture content and
        volume of spills), meteorological and variables and construction practices employed.

        To reduce emissions of fugitive dust and minimize impacts on the local environment, the
        construction contractor will adhere to a number of strictly enforced mitigation measures. These
        include:

            x    Wetting agents will be used regularly to control and suppress dust that may come from
                 the construction materials and from demolition;
            x    All trucks for transportation of construction debris will be fully covered;
            x    Storage of construction debris on-site will be kept to a minimum
            x    Actual construction practices will be monitored to ensure those unnecessary transfers and
                 mechanical disturbances of loose materials are minimized and to ensure that any
                 emissions of dust are negligible; and
            x    A wheel wash area will be established to minimize dust and mud accumulations in City
                 streets, or periods street sweeping may be utilized to maintain an acceptable
                 street/sidewalk condition.

        4.4.9    Construction Noise

        The construction/renovation of 190 West Second Street project will require the use of equipment
        that can be heard from off-site locations. Construction is expected to commence on September 1,
        2014 and be completed in August 31, 2016 ­ approximately a 24-month duration. The Proposed
        Project is committed to mitigate noise impacts of the construction of the project. Increased
        community sound levels, however, are an inherent consequence of construction activities. The
        area currently has significant ambient noise due to urban activities including traffic noise from
        West Second Street, West First Street and C Street, building, mechanical equipment, and aircraft
        flying overhead. Noise from construction will be kept within applicable regulations regarding
        time of the day and level.

        Construction will occur during the daytime hours as defined by the Boston Noise Regulation. In
        some instances, weekend and second shifts may be required. When these events arise, all required
        permits will be in place.

        4.4.10   Construction Noise Mitigation

        Every reasonable effort will be made to minimize the noise impact of construction activities.
        Mitigation measures will include:

            x    Scheduling of work during daytime hours;
            x    Using appropriate mufflers on all equipment and providing ongoing maintenance of
                 intake and exhaust mufflers;
            x    Maintaining muffling enclosures on continuously operating equipment, such as air
                 compressors and welding generators;
            x    Replacing specific construction operations and techniques by less noisy ones where
                 feasible ­ e.g. using vibration pile driving instead of impact driving if practical;

         4.4.11   Rodent Control

         The City of Boston has declared that the infestation of rodents in the City is a serious problem. In
         order to control this infestation, the City enforces the requirements established under the
         Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, Chapter 11, 105 CMR 410.550 and the State Building Code,
         Section 108..6. Policy Number 87-4 (City of Boston) established that extermination of rodents
         shall be required for issuance of permits of demolition, excavation, foundation and basement
         rehabilitation. The Proposed Project will develop a rodent control program prior to its
         construction start. During construction, rodent control service visits will be made by a certified
         rodent control firm to monitor the situation.

         4.4.12   Utilities

         The construction process should not affect the existing utilities. Connections to the existing
         services will be performed following approval and survey by the Boston Water and Sewer
         Commission, Nstar and Keyspan. Police details will be utilized to control traffic during street
         excavations.

4.5      Sustainability

The Project will reduce energy use across systems with strategies such as energy efficient equipment and
appropriate insulation in a tight building envelope. No chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) will be used in cooling
equipment. Instead, refrigerants with low ozone depleting/global warming potential will be prioritized.

The Project will achieve compliance with Article 37 of the Boston Zoning Code by being LEED Certifiable
under the LEED NC (New Construction) rating system (see Appendix C).

Sustainable highlights of the Project include:
Redevelopment of a currently underutilized transit-oriented site. The Project is in a dense urban area, close
to regional and local public transportation. The new residential building will be located proximate to public
transportation on the MBTA's Broadway Station - Red line and Bus Routes 9, 11 and 47, encouraging
minimal vehicle use.

The Project will embody urban principles encouraging public transportation and pedestrian activity. The
use of cars at this site is expected to be minimal in comparison to the public transportation and pedestrian
trips. Other transportation related characteristics include:
     x The development team will have discussions with Zipcar to potentially include shared-car
          facilities within the building.
     x The Proponent will include two electric car charging stations in the parking garage.
     x One bicycle parking space will be included for each residential unit; the majority will be covered.

4.7       Historic Resources Component

The existing building on the project site was constructed circa 1888 according to Boston Inspectional
Service's building records. Since that time, it has been used for storage, vehicle storage, warehousing,
and office uses.

The overall Project Site does not contain any historical structures and is not within a nationally or locally
designated historic district. According to historical records at the Massachusetts Historical Commission and
the Massachusetts Cultural Resource Information System (MACRIS), the Project Site (190 West Second
Street) currently contains no building of historic significance.

Other architecturally historical buildings remaining listed by MACRIS within the immediate Project Site
vicinity include the following: The Signal Building built in 1912, (154 West Second Street); William R
Lawrence Row Houses built in 1852 (161, 163, 165 and 167 West Second Street) and the former Hersey
Brothers Machinery Manufacturing Co building from c1899 (314-330 West Second Street). The Proposed
Project will not adversely impact any historical structures or districts.

5.0     TRANSPORTATION


5.1     Introduction

        Howard/Stein-Hudson Associates, Inc. (HSH) has conducted an evaluation of the transportation
        impacts of the proposed mixed-use development containing residential and retail uses to be
        located at 190-206 West Second Street in South Boston (the "Project" and/or the "Site"). This
        transportation study adheres to the Boston Transportation Department (BTD) Transportation
        Access Plan Guidelines and Article 80 development review process. This study includes an
        evaluation of existing conditions, future conditions with and without the Project, projected parking
        demand, loading operations, transit services, and pedestrian activity.

5.1.1   Project Description

        The Project Site is located at 190-206 West Second Street in South Boston and is bounded by C
        Street to the east, West Second Street to the south, West First Street to the north, and the a vacant
        lot and the Signal Building to the west as shown in Figure 5.1. The Site also surrounds three sides
        of an existing commercial property located at 188 West Second Street.


        The Site currently contains mostly vacant industrial uses and areas of open space. The Project will
        replace the existing uses and will include 97 rental apartment units and approximately 5,010
        square feet (sf) of ground floor commercial space located along the West First Street frontage. A
        total of 115 parking spaces will be provided on-site in a ground-level garage. The parking will be
        provided for the residents of the Project. No additional parking will be provided for the
        commercial uses. On-site storage will also be provided for approximately 80 bicycles in the
        garage.


        Vehicular access to the garage will be provided by a single driveway along West First Street,
        approximately 250 feet west of C Street. Primary pedestrian access to the residential component
        will be provided by two entrances along C Street, an entrance along West First Street, and an
        entrance along West Second Street along with additional access through the parking garage.
        Loading, deliveries, and trash pick-up will take place curbside along West First Street.

5.1.2   Study Area

        The study area consists of the following four intersections, also shown on Figure 5.1:


            C Street/West First Street;

            C Street/West Second Street;

            D Street/West First Street; and

            A Street/West Second Street.

        The intersection of B Street/West Second Street is also located in proximity to the Site but was not
        included in the analysis study area due to the lack of vehicular conflicts at the intersection.

5.1.3   Study Methodology

        This transportation study and supporting analyses were conducted in accordance with BTD
        guidelines and is described below.


        The existing conditions analysis includes an inventory of the existing (2013) transportation
        conditions such as traffic characteristics, parking and curb usage, transit, pedestrian circulation,
        bicycle facilities, loading, and site conditions. Existing counts for vehicles, bicycles, and
        pedestrians were collected in April and October 2013 at the study area intersections. The traffic
        counts form the basis for the transportation analysis conducted as part of this evaluation.


        The future transportation conditions analysis evaluates potential transportation impacts associated
        with the Project. Long-term impacts are evaluated for the year 2018, based on a five-year horizon
        from the existing year (2013).          Expected roadway, parking, transit, pedestrian, bicycle
        accommodation, and loading capabilities and deficiencies are identified. This section includes the
        following scenarios:


            The 2018 No-Build conditions scenario includes both general background traffic growth and
            traffic growth associated with specific developments and transportation improvements that are
            planned in the vicinity of the Project Site.

            The 2018 Build conditions scenario includes Project-generated traffic volume estimates added
            to the traffic volumes developed as part of the 2018 No-Build conditions scenario.

        The final part of the transportation study identifies measures to mitigate Project-related impacts
        and to address any traffic, pedestrian, bicycle, transit, safety, or construction related issues that are
        necessary to accommodate the Project.


        An evaluation of short-term traffic impacts associated with construction activities is also provided.

5.2.3   Existing Traffic Conditions

        Traffic movement data was collected at the intersection of A Street/West Second Street in April
        2013 and at the remainder of the intersections in October 2013. Manual turning movement counts
        (TMCs) and vehicle classification counts were conducted during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
        periods (7:00-9:00 a.m. and 4:00-6:00 p.m., respectively) for the study area intersections.


        The vehicle classification counts included car, truck, pedestrian, and bicycle movements. Based
        on the TMCs, the peak hours of vehicular traffic throughout the study area are 7:45-8:45 a.m. and
        5:00-6:00 p.m. The detailed traffic counts are provided in the Appendix.

Seasonal Adjustment
        In order to account for seasonal variation in traffic volumes throughout the year, data provided by
        the MassDOT were reviewed. Typically, nearby continuous traffic count stations are used to
        determine monthly fluctuations in traffic volumes. The most recent (2011) MassDOT Weekday
        Seasonal Factors were used to determine the need for seasonal adjustments to the September 2013
        TMCs. The 2011 seasonal adjustment factor for April and October for roadways similar to the
        study area is 0.92, which indicates that average month traffic volumes are approximately 92
        percent of typical April and October traffic volumes. The traffic counts were not adjusted to
        reflect average month conditions. The 2013 Existing weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic
        volumes are shown in Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3, respectively.

        5.2.4       Existing Traffic Operations

        The criterion for evaluating traffic operations is level of service (LOS), which is determined by
        assessing average delay incurred by vehicles at intersections and along intersection approaches.
        Trafficware's Synchro (version 6) software package was used to calculate average delay and
        associated LOS at the study area intersections. This software is based on the traffic operational
        analysis methodology of the Transportation Research Board's 2000 Highway Capacity Manual
        (HCM).


        The volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio is a measure of congestion at an intersection approach. A v/c
        ratio of one or greater indicates that the traffic volume on the intersection approach exceeds
        capacity.


        The 50th percentile queue length, measured in feet, represents the maximum queue length during a
        cycle of the traffic signal with typical (or median) entering traffic volumes.


        The 95th percentile queue length, measured in feet, represents the farthest extent of the vehicle
        queue (to the last stopped vehicle) upstream from the stop line during 5 percent of all signal
        cycles. The 95th percentile queue will not be seen during each cycle. The queue would be this
        long only 5 percent of the time and would typically not occur during off-peak hours.


        Field observations were performed by HSH to collect intersection geometry such as number of
        turning lanes, lane length, and lane width.


        LOS designations are based on average delay per vehicle for all vehicles entering an intersection.
        Table 5-1 displays the intersection level of service criteria. LOS A indicates the most favorable
        condition, with minimum traffic delay, while LOS F represents the worst (unacceptable)
        condition, with significant traffic delay. LOS D or better is typically considered acceptable in an
        urban area. However, LOS E or F is often typical for a stop controlled minor street that intersects
        a major roadway.

        Table 5-2 and Table 5-3 present the 2013 Existing conditions operational analysis for the study
        area intersections during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, respectively. The detailed analysis sheets
        are provided in the Appendix.


        As shown in Table 5-2, the signalized intersections in the study area currently operate at LOS C
        or better, with all movements at the intersections operating at LOS D or better during the a.m.
        peak hour. The unsignalized intersections in the study area currently operate at LOS B or better,
        with minimal delay and queuing during the a.m. peak hour. The longest queues at the study area
        intersections occur along the A Street northbound approach to West Second Street and the D
        Street northbound approach to West First Street and range from approximately 150 to 180 feet
        (approximately 6-8 vehicles).


        As shown in Table 5-3, the signalized intersections in the study area currently operate at LOS B,
        with all movements at the intersections operating at LOS D or better during the p.m. peak hour.
        The unsignalized intersections in the study area currently operate at LOS B or better, with minimal
        delay and queuing during the p.m. peak hour. The longest queues at the study area intersections
        occur along the A Street southbound approach to West Second Street and the D Street southbound
        approach to West First Street and range from 250 to 300 feet (approximately 10 to 12 vehicles).


        Based on the existing conditions traffic operational analysis, the intersections operate under
        capacity with no apparent operational issues during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

5.2.7   Existing Pedestrian Conditions

        The Project Site is located adjacent to C Street, West First Street, and West Second Street in South
        Boston. Sidewalks are provided along all streets within the study area. The sidewalks along West
        Second Street are generally in good condition and supply more than adequate capacity. The
        sidewalks along C Street and West First Street are generally in fair to poor condition along the Site
        frontage. Crosswalks are also provided at the study area intersections with the exception of C
        Street/West First Street. It is anticipated that residents and visitors of the Site will primarily use C
        Street and West Second Street to walk to the public transportation and commercial businesses at
        Broadway Station and along West Broadway and Dorchester Avenue.


        To estimate the amount of pedestrian activity within the study area, pedestrian counts were
        conducted concurrent with the TMCs at the study area intersections and are presented in
        Figure 5.6. The pedestrian activity within the study area is heaviest along A Street, West Second
        Street, and D Street.



5.2.8   Existing Bicycle Facilities

        In recent years, bicycle use has increased dramatically throughout the City of Boston. The South
        Bay Harbor Trail is located to the west of the Project Site and is a multi-use path that will
        ultimately connect the Fort Point district of Boston to the Southwest Corridor Park. Along with the
        South Bay Harbor Trail, the following roadways within the study area are designated bicycle
        routes on the City of Boston's "Bike Routes of Boston" map:


            Dorchester Avenue and West Broadway are designated as advanced routes suitable for
            traffic-condient cyclists with on-road experience.

            West First Street, West Second Street, A Street, and D Street are designated as
            intermediate routes suitable for riders with some on-road experience.

        Bicycle counts were conducted concurrent with the vehicular TMCs and are presented in
        Figure 5.7. As shown in Figure 5.7, bicycle volumes are generally light around the Project Site,
        with the heaviest movements along A Street, D Street, and West Second Street.


        Hubway is a bicycle sharing system in the Boston area, which was launched in 2011 and consists
        of over 100 stations and 1,000 bicycles. There are two Hubway stations in close proximity to the
        Project Site, also shown in Figure 5.8:


            Boston Convention & Exhibition Center (BCEC) ­ Located along Summer Street near the
            BCEC, this Hubway station has an overall capacity of 19 bicycles.

            Dorchester Avenue at Gillette Park ­ Located along Dorchester Avenue near West Second
            Street, this Hubway station has an overall capacity of 15 bicycles.

5.2.9   Car Sharing Services

        Car sharing, predominantly served by Zipcar in the Boston area, provides easy access to short term
        vehicular transportation. Vehicles are rented on an hourly or daily, and all vehicle costs (gas,

5.3     Future Conditions

        For transportation impact analyses, it is standard practice to evaluate two future conditions: No-
        Build conditions (without the proposed project) and Build conditions (with the proposed project).
        In accordance with BTD guidelines, these conditions are projected to a future date five years from
        the Existing conditions year. For this evaluation of this Project, 2018 was selected as the horizon
        year for the future conditions analyses.


        This section presents a description of the 2018 future conditions scenarios and includes an
        evaluation of the transportation facilities under the No-Build and Build conditions.

5.3.1   No Build Conditions

        The No-Build conditions reflect a future scenario that incorporates any anticipated traffic volume
        changes independent of the Project and any planned infrastructure improvements that will affect
        travel patterns throughout the study area. Infrastructure improvements include roadway, public
        transportation, pedestrian and bicycle improvements. Traffic volume changes are based on two
        factors: an annual growth rate and growth associated with specific developments near the Project.

Background Traffic Growth
        The methodology to account for future traffic growth, independent of the Project, consists of two
        parts. The first part of the methodology accounts for general background traffic growth that may
        be affected by changes in demographics, automobile usage, and automobile ownership. Based on a
        review of recent traffic studies conducted for nearby projects and to account for any additional
        unforeseen traffic growth, a one-percent per year annual traffic growth rate was used to develop
        the future conditions traffic volumes.


        The second part of the methodology identifies any specific planned developments that are
        expected to affect traffic patterns throughout the study area within the future analysis time
        horizon. The following projects are located in the vicinity of the study area and traffic volumes
        associated with these projects were specifically accounted for in the future conditions scenarios:


            South Boston Boutique Hotel ­ This project is located at the corner of West Broadway and
            Dorchester Avenue and consists of the construction of a 156-room hotel with ancillary retail
            uses. This project is currently under review by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA).

            One Channel Center ­ This project will consist of the construction of 525,000 sf of office
            space, a new parking garage containing 970 spaces and two new open spare areas totaling
            approximately 78,000 sf to be located off A Street. This project has been approved by the
            BRA and is currently under construction.

            West Square ­ This project is located at 320 D Street and consists of approximately 259
            residential units and 143 parking spaces. This project has been approved by the BRA and is
            currently under construction.

            11 West Broadway ­ This project is adjacent to Broadway Station and consists of 50
            residential units, 8,000 sf of retail space, and underground parking. Construction of this
            project was recently completed.

            D Street Development ­ This project is located at 371-401 D Street and consists of a 250-
            room limited service hotel, a 250-room extended stay hotel, approximately 26,300 sf of
            ground-floor retail, and a 1,350 car parking garage. This project has been approved by the
            BRA.

            411 D Street ­ This project consists of the construction of 197 residential rental units and 129
            parking spaces. This project has been approved by the BRA and is currently under
            construction.


        The following projects are also in the vicinity of the Project Site, but are only expected to add
        minimal traffic to the study area intersections. Traffic volumes for these projects were assumed to
        be accounted for in the general background growth rate.


            22-26 West Broadway ­ This project consists of the construction of a 6-story building
            containing 31 rental apartment units and 3,834 sf of retail space. This project has been
            approved by the BRA.

            339 D Street ­ This project consists of the construction of a 24-unit residential development
            with 30 parking spaces. This project is currently under construction.

Proposed Infrastructure Improvements
        A review of planned improvements to roadway, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities was
        conducted to determine if there are any nearby projects in the vicinity of the study area. Based on
        this review, the following improvements are proposed within the study area:


        West Second Street/A Street ­ Improvements are proposed at this intersection as part of the
        Channel Center development. New traffic signal equipment, signage, and pavement markings will
        be provided at the intersection. Pedestrian signal equipment will also be added at the intersection.

No-Build Conditions Traffic Operations
        The 2018 No-Build conditions scenario analysis uses the same methodology as the 2013 Existing
        conditions scenario analysis. Table 5-4 presents the 2018 No-Build conditions operations analysis
        for the a.m. and p.m. peak hours. The detailed analysis sheets are provided in the Appendix.

        As shown in Table 5-4, the signalized intersections in the study area will continue to operate at
        LOS C or better, with all movements at the intersections operating at LOS D or better during the
        a.m. peak hour under the 2018 No-Build conditions. The unsignalized intersections in the study
        area will continue to operate at LOS B or better, with minimal delay and queuing during the a.m.
        peak hour under the 2018 No-Build conditions. The longest queues at the study area intersections
        will continue to occur along the A Street northbound approach to West Second Street and the D
        Street northbound approach to West First Street and range from approximately 200 to 225 feet
        (approximately 8-9 vehicles).


        As shown in Table 5-3, the signalized intersections in the study area will continue to operate at
        LOS B, with all movements at the intersections operating at LOS D or better during the p.m. peak
        hour. The unsignalized intersections in the study area will continue to operate at LOS B or better,
        with minimal delay and queuing during the p.m. peak hour. The longest queues at the study area
        intersections occur along the A Street southbound approach to West Second Street and the D
        Street southbound approach to West First Street and range from 290 to 540 feet (approximately 12
        to 22 vehicles).


        Based on the 2018 No-Build conditions traffic operational analysis, the study area intersections
        have the capacity to accommodate the additional traffic growth expected in the area.



5.3.2   Build Conditions

        As previously summarized, the Project will consist of 97 residential apartment units and
        approximately 5,010 sf of ground floor commercial space. A total of 115 parking spaces will be
        provided on-site in a ground level garage accessed off of West First Street for the residents. No
        additional parking will be provided for the commercial uses on the Site. Secure storage for
        approximately 80 bicycles will also be provided on the Site.

Site Access and Circulation
        As previously shown in the Project Site plan in Figure 3.1, access will be provided to a parking
        garage by a single driveway located along West First Street, approximately 250 west of C Street.
        The parking garage will be located at ground-level and will contain 105 parking spaces for the
        residential uses on the Site.


        Loading and service, including trash, recycling, and deliveries will occur along the curb on West
        First Street. It is anticipated that a change in curb-use regulation along West First Street will be
        necessary to accommodate loading, delivery, and trash operations. A loading dock will not be
        provided on the Project Site.


        Primary pedestrian access to the residential component will be provided by two entrances along C
        Street, an entrance along West First Street, and an entrance along West Second Street along with



190 ­ 206 West Second Street                             86                              Expanded PNF
          access through the parking garage. Pedestrian access to the retail portion of the Site will be
          provided by a single entrance off of West First Street.

Trip Generation Methodology
          Trip generation is a complex, multi-step process that produces an estimate of vehicle trips, transit
          trips, walk trips, and bicycle trips associated with a proposed development and a specific land use
          program. A project's location and proximity to different travel modes determines how people will
          travel to and from the Project Site.


          To estimate the number of trips expected to be generated by the Project, data published by the
          Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in the Trip Generation Manual 1 were used. ITE
          provides data to estimate the total number of unadjusted vehicular trips associated with the
          Project. In an urban setting well-served by transit, adjustments are necessary to account for other
          travel mode shares such as walking, bicycling, and transit.


          To estimate the unadjusted number of vehicular trips for the Project, the following ITE land use
          codes (LUCs) were used:


          LUC 220 ­ Apartment. The apartment land use is defined as rental dwellings located within the
          same building with at least three other dwelling units. Trip generation estimates are based on
          average vehicle rates per unit.


          LUC 820 ­ Shopping Center. The shopping center land use is defined as an integrated group of
          commercial establishments that is planned, developed, owned and managed as one unit. Trip
          generation estimates are based on average vehicular rates per 1,000 sf of gross leasable area. This
          land use was used to develop the trip generation characteristics of the commercial space on the
          Site.

Mode Share
          The BTD publishes vehicle, transit, and walking/bicycling mode split rates for different areas of
          Boston. The Project Site is located within BTD's designated Area 8. The unadjusted vehicular
          trips were converted to person trips by using vehicle occupancy rates published by the Federal
          Highway Administration (FHWA) 2. The BTD's travel mode share data for Area 8 are shown in
          Table 5-6.

Trip Generation
        The mode share percentages shown in Table 5-6 were applied to the number of person trips to
        develop walk/bicycle, transit, and vehicle trip generation estimates. The existing uses on the
        Project Site currently generate minimal traffic volumes and were not accounted for in the trip
        generation estimates. The trip generation for the Project by mode is shown in Table 5-7. The
        detailed trip generation information is provided in the Appendix.

Vehicle Trip Generation
        To develop the overall trip generation characteristics, the adjusted vehicular trips associated with
        the Project were estimated. The Project-generated new vehicle trips are summarized in Table 5-8,
        with the detailed trip generation information provided in the Appendix.

        As shown in Table 5-8, the Project is expected to generate approximately 494 new daily vehicle
        trips (247 entering and 247 exiting), with 27 new vehicle trips (7 entering and 20 exiting) during
        the a.m. peak hour and 40 new vehicle trips (23 entering and 17 exiting) during the p.m. peak
        hour.

Trip Distribution
        The trip distribution identifies the various travel paths for vehicles arriving and leaving the Project
        Site. Trip distribution patterns for the Project were based on BTD's origin-destination data for
        Area 8 and trip distribution patterns presented in traffic studies for nearby projects. The trip
        distribution patterns for the Project are illustrated in Figure 5.11.


        The Project-generated vehicle trips were assigned to the study area roadway network based on the
        trip distribution patterns shown in Figure 5.11 and are shown in Figure 5.12 and Figure 5.13 for
        the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, respectively. The Project-generated trips were added to the 2018
        No-Build conditions traffic volumes to develop the 2018 Build conditions peak hour traffic
        volume networks and are shown in Figure 5.14 and Figure 5.15 for the a.m. and p.m. peak hours,
        respectively.

Build Conditions Traffic Operations
          The 2018 Build conditions scenario analyses use the same methodology as the 2013 Existing and
          2018 No-Build conditions scenario analyses. The results of the 2018 Build condition traffic
          analysis at study area intersections are presented in Table 5-9 and Table 5-10 for the a.m. and
          p.m. peak hours, respectively. The detailed analysis sheets are provided in the Appendix.

          As shown in Table 5-9, the signalized intersections in the study area will continue to operate at
          LOS C or better, with all movements at the intersections operating at LOS D or better during the
          a.m. peak hour under the 2018 Build conditions. The unsignalized intersections in the study area
          will continue to operate at LOS B or better, with minimal delay and queuing during the a.m. peak
          hour under the 2018 No-Build conditions.


          As shown in Table 5-10, the signalized intersections in the study area will continue to operate at
          LOS B, with all movements at the intersections operating at LOS D or better during the p.m. peak
          hour. The unsignalized intersections in the study area will continue to operate at LOS B or better,
          with minimal delay queuing during the p.m. peak hour.


          Based on the 2018 Build conditions traffic operational analysis, the Project will have minimal
          impact at the study area intersections. The study area is shown to have adequate capacity to


190 ­ 206 West Second Street                                        97                          Expanded PNF
          accommodate the additional Project related traffic volumes. No additional capacity of operational
          improvements are needed at the study area intersections or along the study area roadways to
          accommodate the vehicular trips generated by the Project.

Parking
          This section presents the Project's parking supply and an evaluation of the Project's parking
          demand. The Project will provide a total of 105 parking spaces on the Site in a street level garage
          for a parking ratio of 1.01 spaces per unit. This parking ratio is consistent with the district-based
          parking goals developed by the BTD for South Boston (0.75-1.25 parking spaces per unit for
          developments near an MBTA station).


          The parking demand for the commercial/retail component of the Project is expected to be minimal.
          Parking will not be provided on-site for the commercial/retail component and will occur on the
          surrounding roadway network, if at all.

          peak hour and 24 new trips (14 alighting and 10 boarding) will occur during the p.m. peak hour.


          The transit trips will be accommodated by the MBTA Red Line at Broadway Station and the
          MBTA bus routes that run along West Broadway, A Street, and Dorchester Avenue.

        Over the course of a day, the Project will generate an estimated 248 new pedestrian trips and an
        additional 222 new transit trips that will require a walk to or from the Site. This results in an
        additional 470 new pedestrian trips per day. Approximately 19 new pedestrian trips will occur
        during the a.m. peak hour and 31 new pedestrian trips will occur during the p.m. peak hour in
        addition to the transit trips that will also require a walk from the Site. The pedestrian facilities
        surrounding the Site will have adequate capacity to accommodate the pedestrian trips generated by
        the Project.

Bicycle Accommodations
        BTD has established guidelines requiring projects subject to Transportation Access Plan
        Agreements to provide secure covered bicycle parking for residents and employees and short-term
        bicycle racks for visitors. The Project will provide approximately 80 covered and secure bicycle
        storage spaces on-site. Additional storage will be provided by outdoor bicycle racks accessible to
        visitors to the Site in accordance with BTD guidelines.


        All bicycle racks, signs, and parking areas will conform to BTD guidelines and will be located in
        safe, secure locations. The Proponent will work with BTD to identify the most appropriate
        quantity and location for bicycle racks on the Project Site as part of the Transportation Access
        Plan Agreement (TAPA) process.

Loading and Service Activity
        Loading and service operations will occur curbside along West First Street. All trash truck activity
        and residential move-in/move-out activity will also take place along West First Street.


        A summary of anticipated loading/service activity by land use is presented in Table 5-11; the
        sources of the assumptions are presented below. Delivery trip estimates were based on data


190 ­ 206 West Second Street                             99                              Expanded PNF
           provided in the Truck Trip Generation Rates by Land Use in the Central Artery/Tunnel Project
           Study Area report 3. Deliveries to the Project Site will be mostly limited to SU-36 trucks and
           smaller delivery vehicles.


           Residential. Residential units primarily generate delivery trips related to small packages and
           prepared food. Based on the CTPS report, residential uses generate approximately 0.01 light truck
           trips per 1,000 sf of gross floor area and 0.001 medium/heavy truck trips per 1,000 sf of gross
           floor area.


           Commecial/Retail. Retail depend on more frequent deliveries from smaller trucks. Based on the
           CTPS report, retail uses generate approximately 0.15 light truck trips per 1,000 sf of floor area and
           0.15 medium/heavy truck trips per 1,000 sf of gross floor area.

        Commercial/Retail             2         70% between 7:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.
        Total                         3         20% after 1:00 p.m.


        The Project is expected to generate approximately 3 deliveries per day. It is anticipated that the
        majority of these deliveries will occur between 7:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. These numbers do not
        include trash truck trips. For this area, trash truck trips generally occur between 5:00 a.m. and
        7:00 a.m. and do not coincide with the regular delivery activities. The low number of anticipated
        deliveries will have minimal impact on the vehicular operations along West First Street.

5.4     Transportation Mitigation Measures

        While the traffic impacts associated with the new trips are minimal, the Proponent will continue to
        work with the City of Boston to create a Project that efficiently serves vehicle trips, improves the
        pedestrian environment, and encourages transit and bicycle use. As part of the Project, the
        Proponent will bring all abutting sidewalks and pedestrian ramps to the City of Boston standards
        in accordance with the Boston Complete Streets design guidelines. This will include the
        reconstruction and widening of the sidewalks, the installation of new, accessible ramps, the
        planting of trees, and providing bicycle storage racks surrounding the site, where appropriate. The
        Proponent is also requesting that parking along West First Street be signed as resident permit
        parking between B Street and C Street.


        The Proponent is responsible for preparation of the Transportation Access Plan Agreement
        (TAPA), a formal legal agreement between the Proponent and the BTD. The TAPA formalizes
        the findings of the transportation study, mitigation commitments, elements of access and physical
        design, travel demand management measures, and any other responsibilities that are agreed to by
        both the Proponent and the BTD. Because the TAPA must incorporate the results of the technical
        analysis, it must be executed after these other processes have been completed. The Proponent will
        work closely with BTD to determine the level of transportation mitigation that will be necessary to
        accommodate the Project. Any transportation improvements to be undertaken as part of this
        Project will be defined and documented in the TAPA.


        The Proponent will also produce a Construction Management Plan (CMP) for review and approval
        by BTD. The CMP will detail the schedule, staging, parking, delivery, and other associated
        impacts of the construction of the Project.

5.5     Transportation Demand Management

        The Proponent is committed to implementing Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
        measures to minimize automobile usage and Project related traffic impacts. TDM will be
        facilitated by the nature of the Project (which does not generate significant peak hour trips) and its
        proximity to numerous public transit alternatives.


        On-site management will keep a supply of transit information (schedules, maps, and fare
        information) to be made available to the residents and patrons of the Site. The Proponent will
        work with the City to develop a TDM program appropriate to the Project and consistent with its
        level of impact.


        The Proponent is prepared to take advantage of good transit access in marketing the site to future
        residents by working with them to implement the following demand management measures to
        encourage the use of non-vehicular modes of travel.


        The TDM measures for the Project may include but are not limited to the following:


            Orientation Packets: The Proponent will provide orientation packets to new residents and
            tenants containing information on available transportation choices, including transit
            routes/schedules and nearby Zipcar locations. On-site management will work with residents
            and tenants as they move in to help facilitate transportation for new arrivals.

            Bicycle Accommodation: The Proponent will provide bicycle storage in secure, sheltered
            areas for residents. Secure bicycle storage will also be made available to employees to
            encourage bicycling as an alternative mode of transportation. Subject to necessary approvals,
            public use bicycle racks for visitors will be placed near building entrances.

            Transportation Coordinator: The Proponent will designate a transportation coordinator to
            oversee transportation issues, including parking, service and loading, and deliveries and will
            work with residents as they move in to raise awareness of public transportation, bicycling, and
            walking opportunities.

            Project Web Site: The web site will include transportation-related information for residents,
            workers, and visitors.

            Electric Charging Stations: The Proponent will provide a total of two electric charging
            stations on the Site.




190 ­ 206 West Second Street                              103                                 Expanded PNF
5.6     Evaluation of Short-term Construction Impacts

        Details of the overall construction schedule, working hours, number of construction workers,
        worker transportation and parking, number of construction vehicles, and routes will be addressed
        in detail in a Construction Management Plan (CMP) to be filed with BTD in accordance with the
        City's transportation maintenance plan requirements. The CMP will also address the need for
        pedestrian detours, lane closures, and/or parking restrictions, if necessary to accommodate a safe
        and secure work zone.

        To minimize transportation impacts during the construction period, the following measures will be
        considered for the CMP:

            Construction workers will be encouraged to use public transportation and/or carpool;

            A subsidy for MBTA passes will be considered for full-time employees; and

            Secure spaces will be provided on-site for workers' supplies and tools so they do not have to
            be brought to the Site each day.

        The CMP will be executed with the City prior to commencement of construction and will
        document all committed measures.

6.0      INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS COMPONENT

6.1      Introduction

The following analysis describes the existing utility systems servicing the Project area, discusses any
probable impacts that the Proposed Project may have on the utilities, and identifies mitigation measures to
address potential impacts of the Proposed Project.

The Proponent has initiated contact with those responsible for the area's utility systems, including the
Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) to understand and evaluate each system and design the
Proposed Project to prevent disruption of utility services. A BWSC Site Plan and General Service
Application is required for the proposed new water, sewer and drain connections. In addition, a Pollution
Prevention Plan will be submitted specifying best management measures for protecting the BWSC drainage
system during construction. A Drainage Discharge permit will also be required prior to discharge of any
construction dewatering.

Meetings will be scheduled as necessary during building design and permitting processes. Updated design
information on the proposed utility connections, as appropriate, will be provided as the project plans
develop. Sewer, water, storm drainage, and electric utilities are discussed below.

6.2      Sanitary Sewer System

         6.2.1    Existing Sewer System

         The BWSC owns, operates and maintains the sewer system in the vicinity of the overall Project
         Site. 190 West Second Street is presently served by a 36 x 48-inch combined sewer/drain line in
         West Second Street and a 36 x 48-inch combined sewer/drain line in West First Street which flow
         in a westerly direction from the Project Site (see Figure 6-1). The sanitary sewage system
         ultimately connects to the MWRA system where it is treated at the MWRA Deer Island Treatment
         Plant.

         6.2.2    Project-Generated Sewage Flow

         The Proposed Project's sanitary sewage system will connect to the area's existing BWSC sanitary
         sewage system. The Proposed Project will generate an estimated flow in gallons per day (gpd) as
         calculated below. This calculation was based on 314 CMR 7.15 (Sewer System Connection and
         Extension Permit Program), which provides design flow parameters for various building uses.

         Table 6-1         Estimated Daily Sewage Discharges

                                    Estimated Daily Sewage Discharges
            Type of Unit       # Units    # Bedrooms           Sewage Generation (gpd)
             1 Bedroom           71            1                       7,810
             2 Bedroom           26            2                       5,720
                                                TOTAL                  13,530

         6.2.3    Sanitary Sewage Connection

         Sanitary sewage connections from the project sites will be made to the existing combined sewers
         in West Second and West First Street which currently service those areas. A Massachusetts
         Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Sewer Connection Permit will not be required for
         any of these sites since the calculated sewage flow is below 50,000 gpd. In order to obtain service
         approval, the Proponent will submit a General Service Application and Site Plan to the BWSC for
         review and approval.



190 ­ 206 West Second Street                             105                              Expanded PNF
        6.2.4   Sewer System Mitigation

        To help conserve water and reduce the amount of wastewater generated by the Proposed Project,
        the landscaping will be designed to not require permanent irrigation systems. An additional
        reduction to 30% will be achieved with 1.28 gallon per flush toilets, 1.0 gallon per minute
        lavatories and 1.75 gallon per minute showers. Additionally, the sewage collection system will be
        constructed and operated in compliance will all applicable regulations.

6.3     Water System

        6.3.1   Existing Water Service

        The BWSC provides water service to the City of Boston through a well-developed network of
        pipes which is supplied by the MWRA transmission system. There are three existing water mains
        in the vicinity of the Project Site. There is a 16-inch low service main in West First Street and
        West Second Street and a 12-inch low service main in C Street. Service to the Project Site will
        most likely come from the low service main in C Street.

        6.3.2   Project Generated Water Demand

        Water demand generated by the Project has been estimated based on the projected sewage
        generation, and adding 10% to account for system losses and consumption. The heating and
        cooling systems for the building have not yet been designed; however, air conditioning make-up
        water requirements are anticipated to be minimal. The projected water demand for the Project is
        therefore 110% X 13,530 gpd = 14,883 gpd.

        Based on conversations with BWSC, the Proponent's civil engineer is confident that the existing
        water distribution system can provide the required flow to the proposed Project.

        6.3.3   Proposed Water Service

        Domestic water and fire service will be provided from the existing 12-inch low service water main
        in C Street.

        Discussions with BWSC have indicated more than adequate capacity in the water supply system to
        serve the Proposed Project. Flow tests will be performed for final design of the proposed building
        fire suppression system during the detailed design phases.

        Water service to the building will be metered in accordance with the Commission's Site Plan
        Requirements. The Project Proponent will provide for the connection of the meter to the
        Commission's automatic meter reading system consistent with current BWSC policy. Backflow
        prevention devices will be installed on all fire services where required to protect from cross-
        connection hazards. Water supply systems servicing the Project will be gated so as to minimize
        public hazard or inconvenience in the event of a water main break. The Proponent will also
        submit a General Service Application and Site Plan to the BWSC for review and approval.

        6.3.4   Water Supply System Mitigation

        The State Building Code requires the use of water conserving fixtures. Water conservation
        measures such as low flow water closets and restricted flow shower heads will help reduce the
        domestic water demand on the existing distribution system. These systems will be installed
        consistent with the code requirements.

6.4     Storm Drainage System

        6.4.1    Existing Storm Drainage System

        Storm drainage for the Project Site is provided by an existing 36 x 48-inch combined sewer/drain
        line in West First Street and a 36 x 48-inch combined sewer/drain line in West Second Street
        which flow in a westerly direction from the Project Site. (see Figure 6-1).

        6.4.2    Proposed Storm Drainage

        The overall Project site consists mostly of impervious surfaces, with some areas of planting, and
        the proposed building redevelopment is not expected to result in any significant increase in runoff
        from the overall Project Site. The Existing conditions of the project sites do not currently provide
        any meaningful recharge of runoff. The Site will be evaluated during the detailed design phase of
        the project. The Site will have connections to the existing combined sewer in West First and West
        Second Street.

        Any new drainage structures on the overall Project Site will be fitted with standard BWSC Type 5
        catch basin. These basins are fitted with sediment sumps and oil/gas traps. Existing structures to
        remain will be cleaned of debris and retrofitted with oil/gas traps where not already existing.
        Oil/gas traps will be permitted through BWSC and MWRA. If not already in place, BWSC
        plaques will be installed at storm drains that bear the warning "Don't Dump ­ Drains to Boston
        Harbor".

        Any sewer and drain connections that are terminated will be cut and capped in accordance with
        BWSC standards. The Proponent will also submit a General Service Application and Site Plan to
        the BWSC for review and approval.

        6.4.3    Mass DEP Stormwater Management Policy Standards

        In February of 2008, the Mass DEP revised their Stormwater Management Standards to better
        address water quality and water quantity issues associated with project sites. The revisions
        promote increased stormwater recharge, treatment of more runoff from polluting land uses, low
        impact development (LID) techniques, pollution prevention, the removal of illicit discharges, and
        improved operation and maintenance of stormwater best management practices (BMPs).

        A brief explanation of each Standard and the system compliance is provided below:

        Standard #1: No new stormwater conveyances (e.g., outfalls) may discharge untreated
        stormwater directly to or cause erosion in wetlands or waters of the Commonwealth.

        Compliance: The proposed design will comply with this Standard. No new untreated stormwater
        will be directly discharged to, nor will erosion be caused to wetlands or waters of the
        Commonwealth as a result of stormwater discharges related to the proposed Project.

        Standard #2: Stormwater management systems must be designed so that post-development
        peak discharge rates do not exceed pre-development peak discharge rates.

        Compliance: The proposed design will not increase the impervious area compared to the
        pre-development condition. Therefore, there will be no detention system needed to
        mitigate the peak rate of runoff from the site.

        Standard #3: Loss of annual recharge to ground water shall be eliminated or minimized through
        the use of infiltration measures including environmentally sensitive site design, low impact
        development techniques, stormwater best management practices, and good operation and
        maintenance. At a minimum, the annual recharge from the post development site shall

190 ­ 206 West Second Street                             108                              Expanded PNF
        approximate the annual recharge from pre-development conditions based on soil type. This
        Standard is met when the stormwater management system is designed to infiltrate the required
        recharge volume as determined in accordance with the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook.

        Compliance: The Project will meet and exceed this standard by complying with the Boston
        Redevelopment Authority's requirement of recharging 1-inch of stormwater over the entire
        new impervious area.

        Standard #4: Stormwater management systems shall be designed to remove 80% of the average
        annual post-construction load of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). This standard is met when:
        a) Suitable practices for source control and pollution prevention are identified in a long-term
        pollution prevention plan, and thereafter are implemented and maintained;
        b) Structural stormwater best management practices are sized to capture the required water quality
        volume as determined in accordance with the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook; and
        c) Pretreatment is provided in accordance with the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook.

        Compliance: The Project will meet or exceed all standards.

        Standard #5: For land uses with higher potential pollutant loads, source control and pollution
        prevention shall be implemented in accordance with the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook to
        eliminate or reduce the discharge of stormwater runoff from such land uses to the maximum extent
        practicable. If through source control and/or pollution prevention, all land uses with potential
        pollutant loads cannot be completely protected from exposure to rain, snow, snow melt and
        stormwater runoff, the proponent shall use the specific structural stormwater BMPs determined by
        the Department to be suitable for such uses as provided in the Massachusetts Stormwater
        Handbook. Stormwater discharges from land uses with higher potential pollutant loads shall also
        comply with the requirements of the Massachusetts Clean Waters Act, M.G.L. c. 21, §§ 26-53 and
        the regulations promulgated thereunder at 314 CMR 3.00, 314 CMR 4.00 and 314 CMR 5.00.

        Compliance: The Project is not associated with Higher Potential Pollutant Loads (per the Policy,
        Volume I, page 1-8). This Project complies with this standard.

        Standard #6: Stormwater discharges within the Zone II or Interim Wellhead Protection Area of a
        public water supply and stormwater discharges near or to any other critical area require the use of
        the specific source control and pollution prevention measures and the specific structural
        stormwater best management practices determined by the Department to be suitable for managing
        discharges to such areas as provided in the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook. A discharge is
        near a critical area if there is a strong likelihood of a significant impact occurring to said area,
        taking into account site specific factors. Stormwater discharges to Outstanding Resource Waters
        and Special Resource Waters shall be removed and set back from the receiving water or wetland
        and receive the highest and best practical method of treatment. A "storm water discharge" as
        defined in 314 CMR 3.04(2)(a)1 or (b) to an Outstanding Resource Water or Special Resource
        Water shall comply with 314 CMR 3.00 and 314 CMR 4.00.5 Stormwater discharges to a Zone I
        or Zone A are prohibited unless essential to the operation of the public water supply.

        Compliance: The Project will not discharge untreated stormwater to a sensitive area or any
        other area.

        Standard #7: A redevelopment project is required to meet the following Stormwater Management
        Standards only to the maximum extent practicable: Standard 2, Standard 3, and the pretreatment
        and structural stormwater best management practice requirements of Standards 4, 5, and 6.
        Existing stormwater discharges shall comply with Standard 1 only to the maximum extent
        practicable. A redevelopment project shall also comply with all other requirements of the
        Stormwater Management Standards and improve existing conditions.

        Compliance: The Project will meet or exceed all standards.

         Standard #8: A plan to control construction related impacts, including erosion, sedimentation, and
         other pollutant sources during construction and land disturbance activities (construction period
         erosion, sedimentation, and pollution prevention plan) shall be developed and implemented.

         Compliance: The Project will comply with this standard. Sedimentation and erosion
         controls will be incorporated as part of the design of this Project and employed during site
         construction.

         Standard #9: A long Term Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Plan shall be developed and
         implemented to ensure that stormwater management systems function as designed.

         Compliance: A long Term Operations and Maintenance Plan shall be developed and
         maintained for this Project.

         Standard #10: All illicit discharges to the stormwater management system are prohibited.

         Compliance: There will be no illicit discharges associated with this Project.


6.5      Electric Systems

         6.5.1 Existing Electric Systems

         NSTAR provides electric service within the City of Boston. It is anticipated there are existing
         electric lines along West Second Street and West First Street. In addition, existing street light
         conduits and streetlights are owned, operated and maintained by the Boston Public Works
         Department, Street Lighting Division. The Proponent will coordinate any modifications to the
         street light system with the Boston Public Works Department.

         6.5.2 Proposed Electric Connections

         The electrical space heating and energy systems for the proposed project have not yet been
         designed, however, it is expected that the project will require service consistent with housing units
         of this size and will not impose any excessive load burden on the existing available electrical
         system. In addition, appropriate energy-saving measures will be incorporated into the building
         design and construction.

6.6      Telephone Systems

Verizon New England provides telephone service to the Project area and the Project Site. Telephone
service is provided to the Project Site via overhead wires. It is expected that the Project will require service
consistent with housing units of this size and will not impose any excessive load burden on the existing
system.

6.7      Cable Systems

Comcast and RCN provide cable service in this area and it is anticipated to be available for the Project Site.
The Project will not impose any excessive load burden on the existing system. Any upgrades required to
the service will be coordinated with the service provider.

6.8      Steam Systems

Steam services have not been identified in this area and it is not proposed that steam be used to service this
facility.

6.9      Gas Systems

         6.9.1 Existing Natural Gas Systems

         National Grid provides natural gas service in the project area. Discussions with National Grid
         Energy Delivery will occur during the detailed design phase to confirm that there is adequate
         natural gas for this project.

         6.9.2 Proposed Natural Gas Connections

         The space heating system for the Proposed Project has not yet been designed. However, it is not
         expected that the Project would require excessive amounts of gas. In addition, energy-saving
         measures will be incorporated into the building design and construction.

6.10     Utility Protection During Construction

During construction, infrastructure will be protected using sheeting and shoring, temporary relocations, and
construction staging as required. The contractor will be required to coordinate all protection measures,
temporary supports, and temporary shutdowns of all utilities with the appropriate utility owners and/or
agencies. The contractor will also be required to provide adequate notification to the utility owner prior to
any work commencing on their utility. Also, in the event a utility cannot be maintained in service during
switchover to a temporary or permanent system, the contractor will be required to coordinate the shutdown
with the utility owners and Project abusers to minimize impacts and inconveniences accordingly.

Re:     Letter of Intent (LOI) to File Expanded Project Notification Form (PNF)
        Article 80-Large Project Review
        For 181-185 West First Street & 184, 190 & 206 West Second Street, South Boston, MA

Dear Mr. Meade,

I am writing to notify the Boston Redevelopment Authority of the intent of Triad Alpha Partners LLC
(TRIAD) to file an Expanded Project Notification Form ("PNF") with the BRA under Article 80-Large
Project Review requirements of the Boston Zoning Code. The proposal is for a multi-family residential
development with 104 residential units and 4,000 square foot retail space with associated garage parking
for 115 spaces to serve these uses (the "Project").

The site sits on approximately 49,751 square feet of land (five parcels) located at 181 West First Street,
185 West First Street, 184 West Second Street, 190 West Second Street and 206 West Second Street in
the South Boston neighborhood of Boston. The Project Site is located within 0.4 mile of the Broadway
MBTA Stations and within 1/2 mile to the Boston Convention Center. The existing use as a warehouse
and storage yard will be demolished in order to make space for the new three story multi-family
residential building.

The Project site is located within the First Street Neighborhood Development Area (NDA) of South
Boston, per Article 68 Section 39 Table B, and will be built as-of-right. The Project will meet the zoning
dimensional requirements of the Boston Zoning Code (Article 68 and Table E) and we will not be looking
for any variances or conditional uses.

The Proponent would like to commence "Large Project Review" under Article 80 of the Code with the
filing this Letter of Intent. The Expanded Project Notification Form (PNF) will be filed within the next
couple of weeks. The project proponent is looking forward to conducting an outreach program to City
agencies, neighborhood representatives and groups, elected officials, and other interested parties over the
next couple of months with respect to the Project. The principals of TRIAD have attended and
participated in the East & West Street Planning and Zoning process and look forward to continuing their
collaboration throughout the Article 80 review process.

We look forward to continuing to meet with you and your staff in the coming weeks on what we feel is a
beneficial project to the South Boston neighborhood and meets the new zoning requirements implemented
recently during the East & West Street Planning and Zoning process.

Sincerely,
Triad Alpha Partners LLC

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The River Edge Colorado development is located in Garfield County. It is west of State Highway (SH) 82
approximately six miles south of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. The project site encompasses
approximately 160 acres. The development is planned to be mostly residential and is proposed to
include 366 Residential units comprised of single family homes plus a neighborhood center and a water
treatment and maintenance facility.
Transportation impacts on SH 82 were assessed for the years 2018 and 2030 with and without the
development. Analysis was conducted based upon CDOT criteria and the existing roadway category.
Analysis included intersection Level of Service (LOS), signal warrant analysis, and signal progression
analysis.
Three intersections were analyzed during the AM, PM, and Saturday peak hours. The intersections
included:
             SH 82 at Cattle Creek Road
             SH 82 at Marand Road
             SH 82 at Spring Valley Road
Spring Valley Road is the closest signalized intersection to the proposed development and is north of the
development.
2018 Background
Traffic volumes along State Highway 82 are expected to increase by a compounded growth factor of
1.11 into 2018.
The following mitigation efforts will be needed without the project in order to maintain efficient
operations along the corridor:
             Spring Valley Road at SH 82 - Re-timing improvements in order to maintain acceptable LOS
             operations during the peak hours. This improvement will allow for LOS D or better during all
             peak hours.
             Cattle Creek Road at SH 82 ­ The westbound right turn should be separated
Although Cattle Creek Road and Marand Road side-street approaches notice delay at the stop controlled
intersections, it is not expected that the side street volumes will be high enough to warrant a signal
without the project. The suggested mitigation efforts are not necessitated by the project.
2030 Background
Traffic volumes along State Highway 82 are expected to increase by a compounded growth factor of
1.31 into 2030.
The following mitigation efforts will be needed without the project in order to maintain efficient
operations along the corridor:
             Spring Valley Road at SH 82 ­ The eastbound and westbound turn movements should be
             separated from the through movements. This mitigation will allow for LOS D or better
             during all peak hours.

                                                                                                       1

             Cattle Creek Road at SH 82 ­ This intersection will need to be signalized in 2030 due to
             background growth. Peak hour signal warrants are expected to be met in the AM and PM
             peak hours. This improvement will allow for LOS C or better during all peak hours.
Although Marand Road side-street approaches notice delay at the stop controlled intersection, it is not
expected that the side street volumes will be high enough to warrant a signal. The suggested mitigation
efforts are not necessitated by the project.
2018 Plus Project
All River Edge Colorado development traffic will access SH 82 at Cattle Creek Road in the year 2018.
The following mitigation efforts will be needed with the project in order to maintain efficient operations
along the corridor:
             Cattle Creek Road at SH 82 - A signal will be needed at Cattle Creek Road and SH 82 upon
             buildout. With a signal at Cattle Creek Road, the intersection is shown to operate at a LOS B
             or better during all peak hours. The westbound right turn will not need to be separated if a
             signal is present.
The mitigation efforts are necessitated by the project traffic. The project does not significantly impact
Marand Road at SH 82 or Spring Valley Road at SH 82.
Peak hour signal warrants were conducted for the intersection of Cattle Creek Road at SH 82. Cattle
Creek Road is expected to meet the peak hour warrants in 2018 with the project.
2030 Plus Project
Similar to 2018 all River Edge Colorado development traffic will access SH 82 at Cattle Creek Road in the
year 2030. The mitigation efforts are necessitated by the project traffic. The project does not
significantly impact Marand Road at SH 82 or Spring Valley Road at SH 82.
No additional mitigation efforts are recommended.
Highway Access Requirements
SH 82 is currently a Category E-X roadway. According to the Access Code, direct access service to
abutting land is subordinate to providing service to through traffic movements. The following
requirements will be necessary to gain improved access:
         The spacing of Cattle Creek Road is such that a signal will be appropriate based upon the
         approximate 1 mile spacing to Spring Valley Road.
         Auxiliary left turn lanes are required at Cattle Creek Road. The transition taper length will be
         included with the required storage and deceleration length.
         A right turn deceleration lane with taper is required for southbound traffic turning onto Cattle
         Creek Road
Bicycle and Pedestrian Improvements
To accommodate recreational bicycle activity in the area, a bicycle connection to the RFTA trail near the
main entrance should be requested and bicycle traffic internal to the site be considered in the design.
Adequate facilities are recommended within the development to accommodate pedestrian traffic
throughout the development and to facilitate safe pedestrian crossings at SH 82.
                                                                                                            2

CHAPTER 1.              INTRODUCTION

1.1 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The River Edge Colorado development is located in Garfield County. It is west of State Highway (SH) 82
approximately six miles south of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. The project site encompasses
approximately 160 acres. The Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) runs along the east edge of
the property, somewhat parallel to SH 82. The Roaring Fork River runs along the west side of the
property. Figure 1 shows the site vicinity. Current access to the site exists on SH 82 at Cattle Creek
Road.

The development is planned to be residential in and is proposed to include 366 Residential units
comprised of single family homes plus a neighborhood center and a water treatment and maintenance
facility.

Figure 2 shows the internal roadway layout and general site layout.

1.2 STUDY OBJECTIVES

1.3 STUDY CONDITIONS

This traffic impact analysis has been compiled in order to determine what impacts the proposed
development will have on the infrastructure system.

The AM peak hour, PM peak hour, and Saturday peak hour were included in the study to provide an
evaluation of the potential impact of the development during the weekday morning and evening peak
hour commuter traffic as well as the weekend peak. The following three conditions were analyzed in
this study with the corresponding volumes and network configurations as indicated. These study
conditions are consistent with CDOTs Traffic Impact Study guidelines.

Existing Conditions
Analysis of the existing conditions in the study area were based on turning movement volumes collected
in May 2010 and the existing roadway, intersection geometry, and traffic control as observed in the
field. The counts were adjusted to reflect summer conditions. Analysis included existing summer peak
season, peak hour traffic operations, and an assessment of intersection delay and level of service
performance. The existing conditions provide a baseline for the future analysis.
2018 Background Conditions

Analysis of the 2018 background traffic was conducted to evaluate the impact of background traffic to
the study intersections. The analysis of this condition represents volumes associated with traffic growth
in the region based upon CDOTs growth rates.

2030 Background Conditions

Analysis of the 2030 background traffic was conducted to evaluate the impact of background traffic to
the study intersections. The analysis of this condition represents volumes associated with traffic growth
in the region based upon CDOTs growth rates.

2018 Background Plus Project Conditions

Analysis of the 2018 background traffic plus project traffic was conducted to evaluate the impact of the
project in 2018. This includes full build out of the development. The volumes include the existing
counts with the background growth rate applied to year 2018 along SH 82, combined with the site-
generated trips for all land uses.

Project access to SH 82 is via one intersection located at Cattle Creek Road for 2018.

2030 Background Plus Project Conditions

Analysis of the 2030 background traffic plus project traffic was conducted to evaluate the impact of the
project in 2030. The volumes include the existing counts with the background growth rate applied to
year 2030 along SH 82, combined with the site-generated trips for all land uses.

Project access to SH 82 is via one intersection located at Cattle Creek Road for 2030.

 1.4 INTERSECTION ANALYSIS METHOD

 The traffic operations analysis addressed unsignalized and signalized intersection operations using the
 procedures and methodologies contained in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 (HCM), Transportation
 Research Board, 2000 for the weekday AM and PM peak hour and weekend peak hour traffic
 operations. Study intersection operations were evaluated using level of service calculations as analyzed
 in the Synchro software version 7.

 Level of Service Criteria

 To measure and describe the operational status of the local roadway network and corresponding
 intersections, transportation engineers and planners commonly use a grading system called level of
 service (LOS). LOS is a description of an intersection's operation, ranging from LOS A (indicating free
 flow traffic conditions with little or no delay) to LOS F (representing over-saturated conditions where
 traffic flows exceed design capacity, resulting in long queues and delays).
 Signalized Intersections
 At signalized intersections, traffic conditions were evaluated using procedures and methodologies
 contained in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 (HCM), Transportation Research Board, 2000. The
 operation analysis uses various intersection characteristics (such as traffic volumes, lane geometry, and
 signal phasing) to estimate the intersection's volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio. For signalized intersections
 the HCM defines the level of service as the average delay per vehicle for the overall intersection.
 Table 1 summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for signalized intersections.


Table 1. Signalized Intersection Level of Service Criteria


 Level of Service      Average Stopped Delay      Description
                         (seconds/vehicle)
        A                       < 10              Very low delay. Most vehicles do not stop.


        B                    10.1 to 20           Generally good progression of vehicles. Slight delays.


        C                    20.1 to 35           Fair progression. Increased number of stopped vehicles.


        D                    35.1 to 55           Noticeable congestion. Large portion of vehicles stopped.


        E                    55.1 to 80           Poor progression. High delays and frequent cycle failure.


        F                       > 80              Oversaturation. Forced flow. Extensive queuing.

 Unsignalized Intersections
 For unsignalized (all-way stop-controlled and side-street stop-controlled) intersections,
 the Transportation Research Board's 2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology for unsignalized
 intersections was utilized. With this methodology, operations are defined by the average control delay
 per vehicle (measured in seconds) for each stop-controlled movement. The method incorporates delay
 associated with deceleration, acceleration, stopping, and moving up in the queue. For all-way stop-
 controlled intersections the HCM defines the level of service as the average delay per vehicle for the
 overall intersection. For side street stop-controlled intersections, LOS is reported for the worst
 approach. Table 2 summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections.

 Significance Criteria
 Minimum Acceptable Levels of Service: Garfield County Traffic Study guidelines indicate that all county
 roads must maintain an overall Level of Service C while intersections should operate at an overall Level
 of Service D or better. Colorado Department of Transportation minimum design criteria indicate
 intersections operate at an overall Level of Service D or better.

Significant Impact Criteria: A project typically is considered to have a significant impact at a study
intersection when one of the following criteria is satisfied:
For Signalized Intersections:
When the added project traffic causes an intersection to exceed the Level of Service standard; or when
the background traffic conditions (without project traffic) exceeds the established Level of Service
standards, and the project traffic causes more than a 20 percent increase in the intersection delay.
For Unsignalized Intersections:
Queuing of traffic to adjacent intersections would create impeded traffic flows; or excessive delays are
determined to create potential safety problems. It is typical for an unsignalized intersection to notice
delay higher than 35 seconds (LOS e) for a single approach without meeting signal warrants. Therefore
LOS e or better for a single movement at an unsignalized intersection is typically tolerated.

CHAPTER 2.              EXISTING CONDITIONS

An assessment of the existing transportation system surrounding the project site was conducted.
This provides a clear picture of the system today and sets a baseline for future analysis.

2.1 ROADWAY SYSTEM

SH 82 is a regional highway connecting
Interstate 70 (I-70) to the north with Highway 24
to the south and east. The speed limit along the
highway varies from 55 to 65 miles per hour.
Within the vicinity of the River Edge Colorado
Development, the roadway is a median divided
rural highway with two lanes in each direction.
Auxiliary turn lanes exist at full movement
intersections as well as acceleration and
deceleration lanes.      SH 82 is classified as an
Expressway, Category E-X by CDOT.
                                                            SH82 at Marand Road, Looking North
North of the site is the intersection of Spring
Valley Road. The intersection is signalized at SH 82. On the west side of the intersection is a small
park­n-ride lot for the transit stop that is located at the intersection. East of the intersection are
industrial and commercial uses.

Marand Road is located north of the site and is a local 2 lane access roadway on the east side of
the highway, providing access to industrial and commercial uses. Access exists to a former
restaurant site which is currently vacant on the west side of the highway directly across from
Marand Road. The access is unsignalized and full movement.

Cattle Creek Road intersects CR 110 and the frontage road prior to intersecting SH 82 on the east
side of Highway 82. Commercial uses exist along CR 110. West of SH 82, the land is currently
undeveloped. The intersection is a full movement access.

2.2 TRANSIT, PEDESTRIAN, AND BICYCLE
    FACILITIES

Transit Facilities
The Roaring Fork Transit Authority currently
operates along SH 82 between Glenwood Springs
and Aspen. Valley fare buses operate as Local "L"
and Express "X" buses. Both L and X busses stop at
the intersection of Spring Valley Road and SH 82 on
the near side of the intersection.
                                                             Bus Shelter at Spring Valley Road

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
The Rio Grande Trail
is a multi-use trail
system that travels
from I-70 to the
north to Aspen and
runs parallel to SH 82
on the west side of
the highway in the
vicinity of the site.
This trail was built
within the former rail
corridor     of    the
Denver     and     Rio
Grande        Western
Railroad    (D&RGW)
Aspen Branch. In 1997, the rail corridor and track were purchased using a combination of funding
from local governments, Great Outdoors Colorado, the Colorado Department of Transportation,
and Pitkin County Open Space and Trails. This purchase presented an opportunity to explore
transportation alternatives to SH 82 congestion and the challenge of creating recreation
connectivity in the Roaring Fork Valley. The Roaring Fork Transit Authority manages and
maintains the Rio Grande Trail with the Roaring Fork Valley.

Popular recreational bicycle routes in the area
include loops on Cattle Creek Road and Spring
Valley Road east of Highway 82 to the RFTA trail.
The photo to the right shows the "mapmyride"
routes in the area.

The roadways in the area have limited to no
sidewalks.

CHAPTER 3.             PROJECT TRIP GENERATION

The vehicle trips associated with the River Edge Colorado project were calculated using the ITE
Trip Generation Manual, Eighth Edition. Trip generation forecasts were developed for full build-
out of the property.

The ITE method consists of choosing an appropriate independent variable for each land use for a
particular time of day. The value of the independent variable is multiplied by a weighted average
rate or inserted into a regression equation to calculate the trips generated by each land use. The
ITE land uses planned for development are Single Family Housing (210) and Recreation Center
(495)

Table 3 shows the proposed project trip generation. The notes following the table indicate the
regression equation used to generate trips.

CHAPTER 4.              TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT

Trip distribution was based upon existing traffic patterns.
In general, 65% of the traffic along SH 82 travels south towards Carbondale in the AM peak, leaving 35%
to travel north. In the evening the traffic shifts so that 35% travels south and 65% travels north.
Saturday peak hour traffic is more evenly split between northbound and southbound traffic at 50% to
50%.
Figure 3 shows the external trip distribution.
Traffic was assigned based upon:
         One access point onto SH 82 at Cattle Creek Road in 2018
         One access point onto SH 82 at Cattle Creek Road in 2030
Figure 4 shows the project trips as assigned.

CHAPTER 5.              EXISTING AND PROJECTED TRAFFIC

5.1 EXISTING INTERSECTION OPERATIONS

Existing Traffic counts were conducted in May 2010 by All Traffic Data for AM, PM and Saturday peak
hours. These counts were adjusted to reflect summer peak traffic. According to CDOT records, May
traffic is 0.8 times the average annual traffic. Summer peaks are noticed in July along SH 82 and are 1.25
of the average annual traffic. The counts were factored up by 1.56 to reflect the summer peak. Figure 5
shows the adjusted, existing counts along SH 82 and the intersection lane configuration. Appendix A
contains the unadjusted traffic count data.

5.2 2018 PROJECTED TRAFFIC AND INTERSECTION OPERATIONS

Background traffic projections were developed for year 2018. Background traffic is the traffic that is
expected to travel along SH 82 irrespective of the development. Traffic volumes on SH 82 can be
expected to increase in accordance with historical growth rates, and "background" traffic, without the
development can be estimated using annualized rates of growth developed from the Colorado
Department of Transportation 20-year growth factor for this segment of SH 82. Calculations based on
the CDOT 20-year growth factor produced an eight-year composite growth factor (2010 to 2018) of 1.11.
These volumes provide the baseline conditions for comparative purposes with the total traffic
projections including the project.

Figure 6 shows the projected 2018 background peak hour volumes at each of the study intersections.

5.3 2030 PROJECTED TRAFFIC AND INTERSECTION OPERATIONS

Background traffic projections were developed for year 2030. Background traffic is the traffic that is
expected to travel along SH 82 irrespective of the development. Traffic volumes on SH 82 can be
expected to increase in accordance with historical growth rates, and "background" traffic, without the
development can be estimated using annualized rates of growth developed from the Colorado
Department of Transportation 20-year growth factor for this segment of SH 82. The CDOT 20-year
growth factor is 1.31. These volumes provide the baseline conditions for comparative purposes with the
total traffic projections including the project.

Figure 7 shows the projected 2030 background peak hour volumes at each of the study intersections.

CHAPTER 6.               ACCESS CODE HIGHWAYS IMPROVEMENTS

According to the State Highway Access Code Direct access from a subdivision to the highway shall be
permitted only if the proposed access meets the purposes and requirements of the Code. Local traffic
from a subdivision abutting a state highway shall be served by an internal street system of adequate
capacity, intersecting and connecting with state highways in a manner that is safe as well as consistent
with the assigned access category (Code Section Three) and design requirements (Code Section Four).
SH 82 is designated as an Expressway (Category E-X).
This category is appropriate for use on highways that have the capacity for high speed and relatively
high traffic volumes in an efficient and safe manner. They provide for interstate, interregional, intra-
regional, and intercity travel needs and to a lesser degree, some intracity travel needs. Direct access
service to abutting land is subordinate to providing service to through traffic movements.
Typical spacing of intersecting streets, roads and highways shall be planned on intervals of one mile and
normally based upon section lines where appropriate. One-half mile spacing of public ways may be
permitted to the highway only when no reasonable alternative access to the general street system
exists.
No access to private property may be permitted unless reasonable access cannot be obtained from the
general street system. When private access is permitted, left turns may be allowed if in the opinion of
the department such left turns can be reasonably accomplished and it is not a divided highway. When
direct private access is permitted, appropriate terms and conditions shall be included in the permit to
achieve the following criteria; a) the access should be closed when other reasonable access to a lower
functional street, road or highway is reasonably available, b) the access permit should specify under
what circumstances the closure may be required, and c) if known, the future access location and the
date the closure may occur.
The following lists the auxiliary requirements based upon the Expressway (Category E-X) requirements:
         A left turn deceleration lane will be required for Cattle Creek Road left turn pocket. The
         transition taper length will be included within the required deceleration length.
         A right turn lane with deceleration and taper lengths will be required for Cattle Creek Road for
         the southbound right turning traffic.
         Signal progression analysis must indicate a 40 percent efficiency or better or shall not degrade
         the existing progression. (See Chapter 8)
         Signals at intersections with major cross streets or roads of equal importance may be
         programmed to optimize traffic on both streets equally. Cross-streets of lesser importance

As shown in Table 5, Marand Road continues to notice significant side street delay during the PM peak
hour. Cattle Creek Road notices significant side street delay during AM and PM peak hours.

Marand Road at SH 82 is not expected to meet peak hour warrants.

Partial mitigation at Cattle Creek Road includes separating the westbound left turn and right turn
movements. The AM peak hour warrant is expected to be met, however the PM peak hour warrant is
not expected to be met, full signal warrants are not expected to be met and delay will continue to be
noticed.

The signalized intersection of Spring Valley Road notices overall delay in the PM peak. Mitigation at this
intersection would require adjustment of the signal timing at the intersection. Refer to Chapter 8 for
further discussion regarding signal warrant analysis.

As shown in Table 7, the intersection of Marand Road continues to notice significant delay during the
PM peak hour due to the westbound approach delay. Cattle Creek Road at SH 82 also continues to
notice significant delay. Analysis assumes geometry based upon existing conditions

To mitigate the excessive delay at Cattle Creek Road, a signal is needed. A signal at this intersection is
expected to meet AM and PM peak hour warrants. A signal warrant and progression analysis was
completed and is described in Chapter 8.

The Marand Road intersection is not expected to meet peak hour warrants in 2018. Delay at this
intersection will continue to be noticed. Refer to Chapter 8 for further discussion regarding signal
warrant analysis.

As shown in Table 9, Spring Valley Road intersection notices significant delay during the PM peak hour.
Marand Road continues to notice significant side street delay during the PM peak hour. Cattle Creek
Road notices significant side street delay during AM and PM peak hours.

In order to mitigate the delay at Spring Valley Road, the westbound and eastbound turning movements
need to be separated from the through movements.

Marand Road at SH 82 is not expected to meet peak hour warrants.

Mitigation at Cattle Creek Road includes signalizing the intersection. Both AM and PM peak hour
warrants are expected to be met. Refer to Chapter 8 for further discussion regarding signal warrant
analysis.

CHAPTER 8. SIGNAL WARRANT AND PROGRESSION
  ANALYSIS

8.1 SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS

A signal warrant analysis was performed on the two side-street stop-controlled intersections that
operated with high levels of delay: Marand Road/ SH 82 and Cattle Creek Road/ SH 82. The warrants
identified in the Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)
were used for the analysis. The Peak Hour Volume Warrant, the Four-hour Volume Warrant, and other
relevant factors were considered in evaluating the addition of signal operations at these intersections.
Appendix D contains the signal warrant analysis worksheets.

Peak Hour Warrant

The Peak Hour Warrant, which compares the volumes at an intersection during the peak hour of
operation to the warrant requirements for the major street and minor street traffic, was evaluated for
the scenario in the 2018 and 2030 plus project conditions. The rural warrants were used for both
intersections.

2018

Cattle Creek Road/ SH 82 was considered for signalization as a mitigation measure. Cattle Creek Road is
expected to meet the AM peak hour warrants without the project. Both AM and PM peak hour warrants
are expected to be met with the project in 2018. Marand Road is not expected to meet the peak hour
warrants in 2018. If project build-out happens prior to 2018, signal warrants will most likely be met by
that time.

2030

Peak hour warrants were run in 2030 without the project in the case the project was not built. Without
the project, Cattle Creek Road meets both AM and PM peak hour warrants. Marand Road is not
expected to meet the peak hour warrants in 2030 with or without the project.




                                                                                                     33

8.2 PROGRESSION ANALYSIS

A signal progression analysis was completed to ensure SH 82 will operate with the appropriate
efficiently based upon the existing category of the highway. CDOT requires an efficiency of at least 40.
Efficiency represents the proportion of all green time that is in progression along a corridor. As a
guideline, efficiency below 12% is considered poor, efficiency between 13% to 24% is considered fair,
and efficiency between 25 to 36% is good. Great progression is anything over 36%. Table 12 provides
the 90th percentile arterial bandwidths on SH 82 the AM and PM peak hours for horizon year 2018 and
2030 plus project.

As shown in Table 12, both 2018 and 2030 scenarios with the project meet the minimum 40% efficiency
for the highway.

CHAPTER 9. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

2018 Background
Traffic volumes along State Highway 82 are expected to increase by a compounded growth factor of
1.11 into 2018.
The following mitigation efforts will be needed without the project in order to maintain efficient
operations along the corridor:
             Spring Valley Road at SH 82 - Re-timing improvements in order to maintain acceptable LOS
             operations during the peak hours. This improvement will allow for LOS D or better during all
             peak hours.
             Cattle Creek Road at SH 82 ­ The westbound right turn should be separated
Although Cattle Creek Road and Marand Road side-street approaches notice delay at the stop controlled
intersections, it is not expected that the side street volumes will be high enough to warrant a signal
without the project. The suggested mitigation efforts are not necessitated by the project.
2030 Background
Traffic volumes along State Highway 82 are expected to increase by a compounded growth factor of
1.31 into 2030.
The following mitigation efforts will be needed without the project in order to maintain efficient
operations along the corridor:
             Spring Valley Road at SH 82 ­ The eastbound and westbound turn movements should be
             separated from the through movements. This mitigation will allow for LOS D or better
             during all peak hours.
             Cattle Creek Road at SH 82 ­ This intersection will need to be signalized in 2030 due to
             background growth. Peak hour signal warrants are expected to be met in the AM and PM
             peak hours. This improvement will allow for LOS C or better during all peak hours.
Although Marand Road side-street approaches notice delay at the stop controlled intersection, it is not
expected that the side street volumes will be high enough to warrant a signal. The suggested mitigation
efforts are not necessitated by the project.
2018 Plus Project
All River Edge Colorado development traffic will access SH 82 at Cattle Creek Road in the year 2018.
The following mitigation efforts will be needed with the project in order to maintain efficient operations
along the corridor:
             Cattle Creek Road at SH 82 - A signal will be needed at Cattle Creek Road and SH 82 upon
             buildout. With a signal at Cattle Creek Road, the intersection is shown to operate at a LOS B
             or better during all peak hours. The westbound right turn will not need to be separated if a
             signal is present.




                                                                                                       35
                                                                                                         App. M-40

The mitigation efforts are necessitated by the project traffic. The project does not significantly impact
Marand Road at SH 82 or Spring Valley Road at SH 82.
Peak hour signal warrants were conducted for the intersection of Cattle Creek Road at SH 82. Cattle
Creek Road is expected to meet the peak hour warrants in 2018 with the project.
2030 Plus Project
Similar to 2018 all River Edge Colorado development traffic will access SH 82 at Cattle Creek Road in the
year 2030. The mitigation efforts are necessitated by the project traffic. The project does not
significantly impact Marand Road at SH 82 or Spring Valley Road at SH 82.
No additional mitigation efforts are recommended.
Highway Access Requirements
SH 82 is currently a Category E-X roadway. According to the Access Code, direct access service to
abutting land is subordinate to providing service to through traffic movements. The following
requirements will be necessary to gain improved access:
         The spacing of Cattle Creek Road is such that a signal will be appropriate based upon the
         approximate 1 mile spacing to Spring Valley Road.
         Auxiliary left turn lanes are required at Cattle Creek Road. The transition taper length will be
         included with the required storage and deceleration length.
         A right turn deceleration lane with taper is required for southbound traffic turning onto Cattle
         Creek Road
Bicycle and Pedestrian Improvements
To accommodate recreational bicycle activity in the area, a bicycle connection to the RFTA trail near the
main entrance should be requested and bicycle traffic internal to the site be considered in the design.
Adequate facilities are recommended within the development to accommodate pedestrian traffic
throughout the development and to facilitate safe pedestrian crossings at SH 82.

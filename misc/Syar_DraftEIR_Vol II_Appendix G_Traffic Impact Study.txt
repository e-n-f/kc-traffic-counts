EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a traffic impact analysis for the proposed Syar Napa Quarry
Expansion project (project) in the County of Napa, California. The purpose of this study is to
evaluate traffic impacts to the proposed project. The study evaluated localized traffic conditions
that could potentially be impacted by the proposed project. This study and the recommendations
within will be used in the Syar Napa Quarry Expansion Environmental Impact Report.

Eight intersections were evaluated in this study. These intersections are:

       1.   SR 221 and Magnolia Drive/James Demer Drive,
       2.   SR 221 and Streblow Drive,
       3.   SR 221 and Basalt Road,
       4.   SR 221 and Kaiser Road,
       5.   SR 221 and Napa Valley Corporate Way,
       6.   SR 221 and SR 12/29,
       7.   SR 221 and Imola Avenue, and
       8.   SR 29 and SR 12/SR121 (west of project).

This traffic study evaluates the following scenarios:

       1.   Existing
       2.   Existing Plus Project
       3.   Future
       4.   Future Plus Project

Conditions at the study intersections utilize the existing roadway network. LOS calculations
were performed for the intersections in these scenarios.

Winzler & Kelly performed mid-week traffic counts for the eight study intersections in
September and October 2009. The highest volume counts were used for the LOS analysis.

Trip Generation and Distribution
Winzler & Kelly developed site-specific trip generation rates for the project based on projections
of tons of aggregate sold and the corresponding trip information from Syar Industries, Inc. for
the years on record from 2004 through 2009, peak day of sales data during those five years, and
Quarry exit weigh scale tickets during September 29, 2009 and October 7, 2009. Project trip
generation rates and corresponding trip generation is shown in Table ES-1.

Project trip distribution follows current truck travel patterns. All truck traffic uses California
Department of Transportation (Caltrans) established truck network along SR 12, SR 29, and SR
221. These state routes are classified Terminal Networks (STAA) in the latest California Truck
Network Map (August 2007).

Study Results
The potential impacts of the proposed project were evaluated using the standards and
methodologies set forth by the County of Napa. The study analyzed eight intersections for the
AM and PM peak hour traffic.

Based on the intersection level of service analysis results, the Project was found to have a
significant impact on one study intersection in both the Existing Plus Project and Future Plus
Project conditions. Significant impacts were addressed and feasible mitigations were proposed
to alleviate Project impacts.

Drawing from the results of the traffic impact analysis, it is concluded that:

       1. The proposed Project significantly impacts study Intersection No. 3 during Existing Plus
          Project scenario, but with mitigation (transportation demand management or limitations
          on sales activities), the impact can be reduced to less-than-significant.
       2. The proposed Project significantly impacts study Intersection No. 3 during Future Plus
          Project scenario, but with mitigation (transportation demand management or limitations
          on sales activities), the impact can be reduced to less-than-significant.

The proposed Project mitigations for the Existing Plus Project and Future Plus Project Condition
are:

       1. The project applicant (Syar) shall operate their sales activities to limit the number of new
          truck trips entering and exiting the quarry during the AM peak hour to no more than 50.

       A dedicated Syar staff coordinator would be required to implement and monitor truck
       trips in accordance with this limit and report to the county annually regarding
       compliance. Additionally, it is recommended that permanent traffic count and classifiers
       be installed within the public right-of-way so that reported trip information can be
       verified.

       It should be noted that the use of either limitation on sales activities or the TDM measure
       noted above would result in less than significant project impacts during both the Existing
       Plus Project and Future Plus Project Conditions.

1.0      INTRODUCTION

Winzler & Kelly has evaluated localized traffic conditions that could potentially be impacted by
the proposed Syar Napa Quarry Expansion project (project). This report presents the results of
this traffic impact analysis. This chapter includes a description of the study scope, the
intersections analyzed and the scenarios that were evaluated.

1.1      Project Description and Scope of Study
The Syar Industries, Inc. (Syar) Napa Quarry (Quarry) is located in southern Napa County,
approximately two miles south of the City of Napa on the east side of SR 221 (Napa-Vallejo
Highway) at its intersection with Basalt Road. Primary access to the Quarry is provided by
Basalt Road off of SR 221.

Syar proposes to expand the existing Quarry and extend the term of its current Use Permit (UP)
until approximately 2048. Specifically, this project proposes to:

      1. Continue to allow surface mining and reclamation activities for aggregate processing,
         aggregate product manufacturing, and aggregate/aggregate product sales at the existing
         quarry for an additional 35 years commencing at the time of issuance of the new Use
         Permit (estimated to occur in 2011).
      2. Expand the boundaries of the permitted mining and reclamation area to include an
         additional 124 acres.
      3. Increase the annual saleable aggregate product from 1.0 million tons to 2.0 million tons.
      4. Increase the depth of the existing quarry from the current 150 feet above mean sea level
         (msl) to approximately 50 feet above msl.

This Traffic Impact Study (TIS) was conducted with the intent of identifying potential
transportation impacts associated with the corresponding increase in product sales and associated
truck trips to haul materials from the Quarry to various locations throughout the region, and to
determine measures necessary to mitigate significant impacts. The traffic analysis is based on
peak-hour levels of service for signalized and unsignalized intersections in the project study area.

Additionally, the TIS will review and discuss roadway adequacy for the project, site distance and
safety at intersections, public transportation opportunities, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities.
This includes a review of historical crash records and recommendations for measures to address
any existing or potential safety issues.

1.1.1 Study Intersections
In consultation with County of Napa (County), City of Napa (City), Napa County Transportation
Planning Agency (NCTPA), and the California Department of Transportation District 4
(Caltrans), eight intersections were identified for analysis in this study. Comments on the Traffic
Impact Study scope were received from most agencies contacted, and are included in Appendix
H. A project vicinity and location map with intersection locations are illustrated in Figure 1-1.
The intersections analyzed in this study are listed below, along with control type. Intersections
have been numbered for ease of reference in the remainder of this report.

Intersection No. 7 and No. 8 are located within the City of Napa limits. All other study
intersections are located within the County of Napa. All study intersections are located on State
highway facilities under the jurisdiction of Caltrans.

Intersection No. 3 ­ SR 221 and Basalt Road is the project access/egress from SR221. This
unsignalized intersection includes channelization for both ingress and egress movements,
including:

    ·   Westbound right-turn (onto northbound SR221) acceleration lane
    ·   Westbound left-turn (onto southbound SR221) acceleration lane
    ·   Southbound left-turn (onto Basalt Rd.) deceleration and storage lane
    ·   Northbound right-turn (onto Basalt Rd.) deceleration lane.

The posted speed on SR221 is 50 mph. Lane width, taper lengths, deceleration and storage lane
lengths of the left and right turn channelization appear to meet the minimum design element
requirement of Chapter 400 Intersections at Grade, of the Caltrans Highway Design Manual
(Caltrans, 2012).

The study includes an analysis of seven signalized and one side street stop-controlled
intersection. All intersections are located within the County of Napa or City of Napa. Traffic
conditions at the intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours of traffic.
The AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM, and the PM peak hour is
generally between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the most congested traffic
conditions occur on an average day.

1.1.2 Study Scenarios
The analysis of the following study scenarios was conducted in conformance with the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Four scenarios were evaluated as part of this project:

        Scenario 1:   Existing Condition. Existing conditions were represented by existing peak
                      hour traffic volumes at the study intersections that were obtained from
                      recent traffic counts (September 2009) collected by Winzler & Kelly. The
                      existing counts were adjusted to approximate the number of truck trips
                      normally generated during the AM and PM peak hours of adjacent street
                      traffic. The methodology followed to develop the truck trips is described

                     requirements to mid-week (Thursday) in August.

       Scenario 2:   Existing Plus Project Condition. Existing plus project conditions were
                     represented by Existing traffic volumes on the roadway network in
                     addition to traffic volumes generated from the project for 2.0 million tons
                     of saleable product annually.

       Scenario 3:   Future Condition. Future conditions were represented by cumulative
                     growth traffic volumes on the existing roadway network. Future traffic
                     conditions were estimated using the cumulative analysis from the Napa
                     Pipe Draft EIR (County of Napa, 2009), which utilized growth projections
                     from the Napa Solano Travel Demand Model for the year 2030.

       Scenario 4:   Future Plus Project Condition. Future plus project conditions were
                     represented by future traffic volumes on the roadway network in addition
                     to traffic volumes associated with the project for 2.0 million tons of
                     saleable product annually.

2.0       METHODOLOGY

This chapter describes the methods used in performing the traffic impact analysis for each
scenario described in Chapter 1. It includes a discussion of the data requirements, analysis
methodologies, and level of service standards. Due to potential project impacts across several
jurisdictional boundaries, including the County of Napa, City of Napa, Napa County
Transportation and Planning Agency and Caltrans, this chapter includes a discussion of the
relevant policy guidelines adopted by those jurisdictions.

2.1       Data Requirements
The data requirements for the traffic impact analysis include:

      ·   Existing traffic volumes; including turning movement counts
      ·   Intersection geometry and lane configuration
      ·   Signal timing and phasing
      ·   Planned and approved developments
      ·   Napa-Solano Travel Demand Model (TDM) Outputs from Solano Transportation
          Authority (STA)

Winzler & Kelly's traffic data collection subcontractor, All Traffic Data, Inc. (ATD) collected
existing traffic counts at the study intersections. Intersection turning movement counts can be
found in Appendix A. Winzler & Kelly collected intersection geometries in the field. Caltrans
provided signal timing and phasing for the existing signalized intersections, and the TDM model
outputs were received from STA.

2.2       Analysis Methodology and Level of Service Standards
Traffic operating conditions for the study intersections were analyzed using level of service
methodology from the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2000),
referred to hereafter as the HCM2000. Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative description of
operating conditions ranging from LOS "A," or free-flow conditions with little or no delay, to
LOS "F," or over-saturated ("jammed") conditions with excessive delays. The various analysis
methods are described in the following sections.

2.2.1 Napa County
The Napa County General Plan 2030 (Napa County, 2008) was adopted on June 3, 2008. In
addition, Napa County provides Traffic Impact Study Policies (Napa County), which include the
following LOS standards for roads and intersections being evaluated:

      ·   The County shall seek to maintain an arterial LOS D or better on all county roadways,
          except where maintaining this desired LOS would require the installation of more travel
          lanes shown on the Circulation Map (page 127 of the General Plan).
      ·   The County shall seek to maintain a LOS D or better at all signalized intersections,
          except where the LOS already exceeds this standard and where increased intersection
          capacity is not feasible without substantial additional right-of-way.
      ·   No single LOS is appropriate for un-signalized intersections, which shall be evaluated on
          a case-by-case basis to determine if signal warrants are met.

2.2.2 City of Napa
Envision Napa 2020 (General Plan) (City of Napa, 2009) was originally adopted on December 1,
1998 and has had subsequent adopted amendments with the latest being adopted in September,
2009. Consistent with the General Plan, the City of Napa provides additional guidance and
requirements for the preparation of traffic impact studies in the document Policy Guidelines:
Traffic Level of Service (LOS) Criteria for Private Development Review (City of Napa, 2004).
This document provides the following LOS criteria:

    ·   The City shall ensure that traffic LOS will not exceed midrange LOS D at all signalized
        intersections on arterial and collector streets with some exceptions where LOS E or LOS
        F will be permitted.
    ·   For traffic signals on State highway facilities, the following criteria shall be used in a
        collaborative effort between the City of Napa and Caltrans District 4:
        o Caltrans has indicated that "Caltrans endeavors to maintain a target LOS at the
            transition between LOS C and LOS D...on State highway facilities; however,
            Caltrans acknowledges that this may not always be feasible and recommends that the
            lead agency consult with Caltrans to determine the appropriate target LOS. Through
            the use of the Napa TMP Traffic Model, which was co-sponsored by the City of
            Napa, Caltrans, NCTPA, and NCFCWCD, the State highway intersections operating
            at less than appropriate target LOS per Caltrans criteria have been identified as a
            preliminary reference (from Exhibit C: State Highway Intersections with LOS E &
            F):
             Intersection No. 6: Hwy 12-29 / Napa Vallejo Hwy ­ permitted LOS F
             Intersection No. 7: Hwy 121-Imola Ave / Soscol Ave. ­ permitted LOS F
             Intersection No. 8: Hwy 12-121 / Hwy 29 ­ permitted LOS F
    ·   The City shall ensure that all new development and redevelopment will meet adopted
        service levels (LOS) for transportation facilities unless findings are made that achieve
        other specific public goals.
    ·   The City shall focus on signalized intersections when evaluating street system LOS.
    ·   When reviewing projects, the City shall monitor stop controlled intersections using LOS
        and the HCM2000 criterion as a guideline, applying Caltrans signal warrant evaluation
        as indicated, and requiring mitigation as necessary.
    ·   For unsignalized intersections, the minimum LOS recommended by the Draft Policy
        Document is midrange LOS E.
    ·   For unsignalized intersections, a low-volume movement may have delays that yield LOS
        E or F but may still be considered as having "acceptable operation" by considering both
        total delay and LOS (defined in terms of average control delay). An intersection traffic
        movement at a stop-controlled approach can be deemed to have acceptable operation
        under the following conditions:
        o Total delay less than 4.0 vehicle-hours for single lane movement with low volume
        o Total delay less than 5.0 vehicle-hours for multilane movement with low volume

This document also provides the following guidelines for determination of significant impacts:

    ·   When a signalized intersection operates at LOS "F" (a violation of the General Plan LOS
        policy) under existing or future baseline conditions, the addition of more than 50 peak
        hour project trips contributes to the continuing operational failure at the intersection. The
        project mitigation should bring the facility to pre-project conditions.
    ·   When a freeway mainline, freeway ramp, or arterial corridor operates at LOS "F" under
        existing, future, or cumulative baseline conditions, the addition of more than 50 peak
        hour project trips contributes to the continuing operational failure at the segment. The
        project mitigation should bring the facility to the pre-project conditions.

2.2.3 Caltrans
Caltrans is responsible for the maintenance and operation of state routes and highways. Within
the project study area, Caltrans' facilities include:

        ·   SR 221 ­ Napa Vallejo Highway
        ·   SR 121 ­ Imola Avenue
        ·   SR 29
        ·   SR 12

Caltrans maintains a volume monitoring program and reviews local agencies' planning
documents to assist in its forecasting of future volumes and congestion points. The Guide for the
Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies (Caltrans, 2002) is intended to provide a consistent basis
for evaluating traffic impacts to State facilities. Caltrans strives to maintain service levels
between LOS C and LOS D. In cases where this LOS is not feasible the lead agency should
consult with Caltrans to establish an appropriate LOS threshold. If an existing state highway
facility is operating worse than the appropriate target LOS, the existing Measure of Effectiveness
(MOE) should be maintained. Three intersections in the study area have agreed upon LOS
standards that are less than the normal LOS standards, which is explained in Section 2.2.2.

2.2.4 Napa County Transportation and Planning Agency
The NCTPA serves the entire countywide transportation planning community. Their primary
role is to work with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) to prepare the Napa
County portion of the Regional Transportation Plan for allocation of state and federal
transportation funds. During the development of this study scope, NCTPA conveyed that their
primary concern for this TIS is the adequacy of the modeling used to project future traffic
patterns, including trip generation and distribution, particularly that any such modeling be
consistent with the Napa-Solano Travel Demand model. The NCTPA also recently completed
development of the County Wide Bicycle Plan (NCTPA, 2012), which was reviewed and is
referenced later in this study.

2.2.5 Measures of Effectiveness
Napa County, the City of Napa and Caltrans each maintain jurisdiction over their respective
roadways and intersections in the study area. Each use measures of effectiveness (MOEs) to

describe the measures best suited for analyzing roadway facilities. Table 2-1 summarizes the
MOEs by facility type used in this study.

 Unsignalized Intersections                Average Control Delay per Vehicle (sec/veh)


2.3    Thresholds of Significance
The County of Napa and City of Napa endeavor to maintain LOS "D" or better on all county
roadways and signalized intersections, except where the LOS already exceeds this standard and
at the intersections indicated in Section 2.2.2.

Caltrans endeavors to maintain a target LOS at the transition between LOS "C" and LOS "D" on
State highway facilities. If an existing State highway facility is operating at less than the
appropriate target LOS, the existing MOE should be maintained, except where the LOS already
exceeds this standard and at the intersections indicated in Section 2.2.2.

To avoid the complexities and confusion associated with using slightly different significance
criteria for each jurisdiction, Napa County, in conjunction with the City of Napa, developed the
following significance criteria for the Napa Pipe project as a derivation of the County General
Plan combined with the City of Napa standards in consideration of the urban nature of the
proposed project. These same intersection significance criteria are used on the Napa Quarry
analysis (County of Napa 2009). For the purpose of this environmental impact report, impacts
would be significant if they result in any of the following:

1. Traffic/Intersection Impacts
    · At a signalized intersection, degrade the AM or PM peak hour level of service from an
        acceptable LOS D or better to LOS E or F.
    · At a signalized intersection, increase traffic volumes at an intersection already operating
        at LOS E or F by more than 50 vehicles per hour in the AM or PM peak hour.
    · At an unsignalized intersection, degrade the AM or PM peak hour level of service from
        an acceptable LOS D or better to LOS E or F and the worst-case approach would
        experience total delay of more than 4.0 vehicle- hours (for a single lane approach) or
        more than 5.0 vehicle hours (for a multi-lane approach);
    · At an unsignalized intersection, increase traffic volumes at an intersection already
        operating at LOS E or F by more than 50 vehicles per hour in the AM or PM peak hour.

An intersection can be mitigated to a less-than-significant level if an infrastructure improvement
or traffic volume reduction results in the intersection operating at an acceptable LOS D or better.

than-significant classification by reducing delay or trips or improving LOS as described in the
above significance criteria.

2.4      Intersection Level of Service Standards and Methodologies
Traffic operating conditions for the study intersections were analyzed using intersection delay-
based methodology. Delay is defined as the total elapsed time from when a vehicle stops at the
stop line of an intersection or behind a queue until the vehicle leaves from the stop line. In the
case a vehicle is in a queue, the total delay time includes the time required for the vehicle to
travel from the last queue position to the stop line. Average total control delay is a function of
the intersection geometry, capacity of the approach in question, and the volume of conflicting
approaches.

The efficiency of motor vehicle operations at signalized and unsignalized intersection is
measured in terms of the LOS of the intersection. The LOS concept is a measure of average
operating conditions at intersections during a span of an hour, and is based on measurements of
the average vehicular delay in number of seconds per vehicle.
Table 2-2 summarizes the ranges of delay associated with the various levels of service for
signalized and unsignalized intersections as defined by the HCM2000.

The vehicular LOS was analyzed for one-way stop-controlled (OWSC) intersections and
signalized intersections. The relationship between average control delay and level of service for
vehicles at signalized and unsignalized intersections as defined in the HCM2000 is shown in
Table 2-2. All signalized and unsignalized intersection level of service analysis was performed
using Synchro 7 software and HCM2000 methodology.

In this study, intersections are evaluated for LOS for motor vehicles. Motor vehicles include all
classes of vehicles (i.e., passenger cars, buses, delivery vans and trucks, recreational vehicles,
semi trucks, and motorcycles). For the purpose of this study, it is assumed that bicycles also
follow the same queuing, yielding, and tuning rules at intersections as motor vehicles.

2.4.1 Unsignalized Intersections
The methodology used to evaluate the LOS for OWSC intersections considers geometry, type of
control, traffic volumes, number of lanes, turning movements, and opposing and conflicting
traffic volumes. At an OWSC intersection, stop signs or yield signs are used to control vehicle
movements on the minor street approach. The intersection approaches that are not controlled by
stop signs are referred to as the major street approaches. Average control delay is defined for
each minor movement and for left-turn conflicting major movements. The movement with the
highest level of delay is presented as the worst case LOS. The correlation between average
control delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections is shown in
Table 2-2.

2.4.2 Signalized Intersections
The LOS methodology for signalized intersections is based on many factors including geometry,
traffic volumes, cycle length and green time for each movement, signal coordination, heavy
vehicle traffic, and pedestrians and bicyclists. The average stop delay in seconds per vehicle is
determined for each lane group and aggregated for each approach and for the intersection as a
whole. The average intersection LOS is reported for signalized intersections. The correlation
between average control delay and LOS for signalized intersections is shown in
Table 2-2.

Peak hour factors were assumed to be 0.92 (Existing Condition), and 1.0 (Cumulative
Conditions). Heavy vehicle percentages were assumed to be two percent. Signal timing charts
for signalized intersections were obtained from Caltrans.

3.0     TRIP GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION

This Chapter discusses the methods and analysis conducted in developing site-specific trip
generation rates for the Syar Napa Quarry (Quarry), due to the unavailability of standard Institute
of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation 8th Edition (ITE, 2008) rates for the project
land use type (quarry).

3.1     Trip Generation
For the analysis of potential project-related traffic impacts site-specific trip generation rates were
developed for the Quarry entrance using historical sales and truck traffic data. This analysis
focuses on truck trips related to aggregate products sold, since peak hour trips related to
employee traffic, deliveries and other non-sale related traffic is expected to remain the same with
the project.

Winzler & Kelly obtained annual sales totals and the corresponding truck trip information from
Syar Industries, Inc. for the years 2004 through 2008, as well as the peak day of sales during
those five years. In addition, aggregate product sales data was provided by Syar Industries Inc.
for the peak sales day in 2009, as well as for September 29, 2009 and October 7, 2009, which
corresponds to the dates turning movement traffic volumes were collected at the study
intersections. All of this data was reviewed and considered in developing the site trip generation
rates. Trip generation rates are rounded to two decimal places, which is in accordance with the
industry standard of care and consistent with rates reported by ITE (2008).

3.1.1   Annual Average Sales Analysis and Corresponding Average Daily Trip Generation
         Rate (2004-2008 historical data provided by Syar)
Between 2004 and 2008 (period of record) the Quarry's annual average sales was approximately
810,000 tons, or 81 percent of the current permitted maximum. During this period the Quarry
averaged approximately 177,000 total one-way trips (sum of entering and exiting vehicles) per
year. This site total average number of trips per year includes trucks hauling aggregate
materials, asphalt concrete (AC), recycled pavement, sand, asphalt oil and fuel delivery trucks,
Fed Ex and UPS delivery trucks, law enforcement vehicles, employee traffic and other outside
contractors such as refuse disposal and non-quarry related activities. Of the site total annual
average trips, there are approximately 100,000 total one-way truck trips per year related directly
to aggregate, asphalt or concrete hauling ingress/egress (truck trips). The remaining trips are
associated with asphalt oil and fuel delivery trucks, Fed Ex and UPS delivery trucks, law
enforcement vehicles, employee traffic and other outside contractors. The annual average
number of truck trips represents approximately 8.1 tons of material per truck trip, or 16.2 tons of
material in each truck leaving the Quarry. The Quarry generally operates for approximately 10
hours per day for 250 working days per year, depending on orders placed. For the 5-year period
of record, the Quarry sold an average of approximately 3,241 tons/day of aggregate materials.
Therefore, on average the Quarry sold approximately 324 tons/hour and generates approximately
40 truck trips/hour. The equivalent daily average truck trip generation rate based on average
quarry sales is 0.12 trips/ton (entering and exiting). The results of this trip generation analysis
are displayed in Table 3-1, below.

3.1.2    Peak Day Sales Analysis and Corresponding Peak Day Trip Generation Rates
         (historical peak day data)
Syar provided all truck weigh tickets and ticket times for the purposes of determining
representative trip generation rate for the daily and AM and PM peak hours of adjacent street
traffic. For adjacent street traffic, the AM peak hour generally occurs between 7:00 AM and
9:00 AM and the PM peak hour generally occurs between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM during the
average day.

The peak day of sales between 2004 and 2009 occurred on July 13, 2009, with approximately
10,400 tons sold. During this day, there were approximately 978 truck trips, of which 138 truck
trips (transporting 1,458 tons) occurred during the hours of 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM and there
were no trips during the hours of 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM. The daily average truck trips represent
10.65 tons/trip, or 21.3 tons of material in each truck leaving the Quarry. On this day, the
Quarry operated for 17.7 hours, from approximately 6:15 AM to 11:58 PM, with a break from
3:30 PM to 7:00 PM. The results of this trip generation analysis are summarized in Table 3-2,
below.

3.1.3   Peak Hour Trip Generation Rate Analysis (using historical aggregate sales data for
         September 29, 2009 and October 7, 2009)
To determine the trip generation rates for the AM and PM peak hours of adjacent street traffic,
truck trips, tonnages and weigh scale tickets and times were obtained from Syar Industries, Inc.
for the traffic count dates of September 29, 2009 and October 7, 2009. This data was analyzed to
determine the quarry sales for these dates and to calculate the truck trip generation rates for the
AM and PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic for these dates. The total sales and
corresponding truck trips based on weigh scale tickets are summarized below:

3.1.4   Project Trip Generation Rates and Trip Generation for the AM and PM Peak Hour of
         Adjacent Street Traffic
Comparing the trip generation rates determined in this analysis, as presented in Table 3-1, Table
3-2 and Table 3-3, shows that the trip generation rates for the Quarry for the AM and PM peak
hours of adjacent street traffic are similar. In addition, the rate and sales for the Quarry
corresponding to the PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic was found to be very small. This
fact was discussed and confirmed with Syar Industries, Inc. The Quarry does not generally send
trucks loaded with material out of the site during the PM peak traffic period because contractors
do not place orders for aggregate deliveries at the end of a typical work day. Contractors also
generally avoid ordering aggregate materials during the PM peak hour due to potential
congestion-related delivery delays. Sales can increase after the PM peak hour, from time to time,
for orders related to night construction work, such as on the peak day of sales.

The representative trip generation rates for the project were determined by comparing the annual
average daily sales for 2004 to 2008, and peak sale day and the daily sales from the traffic count
dates in 2009. It is noted that the daily average sales for the days when traffic counts occurred
was 4,116 tons, which is approximately 27 percent greater than the annual average daily sales of
3,241 tons. On these days, the Quarry sold an average of approximately 420 tons/hour. For the
period of record (2004 to 2008), the Quarry sold an average of approximately 324 tons/hour. A
conservative estimate of hourly sales during the AM peak hour of adjacent street traffic is
generally between the annual average 324 tons/hour to the peak day 587 tons/hour. The rate and
sales for the quarry corresponding to the PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic was found to be

very small, and therefore a conservative estimate for the trip generation rate would be between
zero and 55 tons/hour.

Table 3-4 summarizes the selected truck trip generation rates and Quarry sales levels that were
developed for use in this traffic study. These rates are based on the results of this rate analysis
and discussions with Syar Industries, Inc. staff. Project sales amounts were scaled proportional to
the proposed increase in saleable aggregate product for the project. The project trip generation
and sales levels assume that a maximum of 1.9 million tons of aggregate product per year would
be transported by trucks. The remaining 100,000 tons of aggregate product per year would be
transported by rail. Truck trips associated with the transport of aggregate product by rail would
not enter the roadway network and intersections analyzed in this study. These truck trips travel
on Basalt Road under SR 221 from the Quarry to Syar's rail and barge loading facilities off
Kaiser Road and adjacent to the Napa River. The analysis also assumes truck trips generated by
the project have a directional distribution of 45 percent entering and 55 percent exiting the
project site, which generally corresponds to the entering and exiting splits found during the
turning movement count taken at Intersection No. 3 ­ SR 221 and Basalt Road. It is important to
note that the peak hour trip generation rate for the site may not correspond to the peak hour of
adjacent street traffic. For the purpose of this analysis and compliance with the CEQA
Guidelines, this traffic study addresses potential impacts associated with the peak hour of
adjacent street traffic, which is the generally accepted time period when the greatest impacts to
the transportation system occur.

3.2       Trip Distribution
The distribution of the project generated trips follows the existing truck trip distribution patterns.
Caltrans has established SR 121, SR 221, SR 29, and SR 12 as Terminal Access (STAA) Truck
Networks (truck routes) providing access to all parts of Napa County, west to Sonoma County,
and east to I-80 access from the Napa Quarry. Currently, the majority of truck trips travel south

on SR 221 to SR 29 south to SR 12 (Jameson Canyon Road) and access to I-80 or further south
to American Canyon and deliver aggregate materials throughout the Bay Area. In discussion
with Syar Industries, Inc. this travel pattern is expected to continue in the future.

All truck trips travel to and from the quarry via Basalt Road to SR 221. Those traveling north
are mainly accessing delivery locations within Napa County and in most instances those
traveling south are accessing SR 29 and SR 12 for deliveries to other counties within the Bay
Area. Trip distribution percentages are show in Figure 3-1 and project trips assigned to each
intersection are shown graphically in Figure 3-2.

4.0    EXISTING CONDITION

This chapter describes the existing conditions analysis at the study intersections during both the
AM and PM peak hours based on the peak 15-minute traffic conditions. Also included is a
discussion of transportation facilities in the project area, including the roadway network, transit
services, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

4.1    Existing Roadway Network
The roadways analyzed in this study are functionally classified by both the Napa County General
Plan and the City of Napa General Plan: Envision Napa 2020 (General Plan) (City of Napa,
2009), as adopted June 3, 2008 and December 1, 1998 (with January 1, 2007 amendments),
respectively. These classifications are as follows:

County of Napa:

       Rural Throughways ­ Two to six-through-lane roadways such as Highway 221, designed
       primarily for longer-distance travel between major centers of activity and built with fewer
       or more gentle curves, wider shoulders and limited driveway access. These roadways are
       often referred to as "arterials."

       Rural Collectors ­ Two- to four-through-lane roadways designed primarily to link locally
       important activity centers and provide a collection system for the local roads. Typically
       designed for slower travel speeds than Rural Throughways and may incorporate shaper
       curves, narrower pavement widths, and other features consistent with slower vehicle
       speeds.

       Local Roadways ­ Provide access to individual homes and businesses.

City of Napa:

       Arterials (Major/Minor) ­ Collect and distribute traffic from freeways and to collector
       streets and vice versa. Major arterials consist of four to six lanes and provide a left-turn
       median. Minor arterials have two travel lanes. Can handle up to 40,000 vehicles per day
       and have typical intersection spacing of ½-to 1 mile.

       Collectors ­ Serve as connectors between local and arterial streets and provides direct
       access to parcels. Collectors carry two lanes of traffic, usually without a left turn median
       and can carry up to 12,000 vehicles per day. Typical intersection spacing is a ¼-mile.

       Local Streets ­ Provide access to parcels.

State Route (SR) 221 (also known as Napa Vallejo Highway) is a four-lane Rural Throughway
which extends in a north-south direction, from Imola Ave. and the northern limits of the project
study area to SR 29 south. SR 221 is characterized by higher speeds, standard 12-foot wide

lanes, no bicycle lanes, ample shoulders and a divided median through most of its length. The
posted speed limit ranges from 35 miles per hour (mph) to 55 mph.

State Route 29 is primarily a two- to four-lane Rural Throughway that stretches through Napa
County in a generally north-south direction (County of Napa, 2009). State Route 29 varies
greatly in character as it traverses the County (County of Napa, 2009). South of its intersection
with State Route 37 in Vallejo, this road becomes Sonoma Boulevard. Between Vallejo and State
Route 121 West, State Route 29 is a four-lane Rural Throughway (County of Napa, 2009). North
of State Route 121 West and south of Trancas Street, just west of the project site, a portion of
State Route 29 is designated as a freeway (see above) (County of Napa, 2009). Between Trancas
Street and the town of Yountville, State Route 29 reverts to a four-lane divided Rural
Throughway. North of Yountville, State Route 29 becomes an undivided two-lane road (County
of Napa, 2009). The posted speed limit ranges between 45 and 60 mph (County of Napa, 2009).
SR 12 is primarily a two-lane rural throughway; with a section that is four-lane at the intersection
of SR 29. It extends east-west, connecting Sonoma and Napa counties and is characterized by
higher speeds and standard 12-foot wide lanes. The posted speed limit in the project study area
is 45 mph.

Imola Avenue is a rural collector that has four lanes, with sidewalks and Class II bicycle facilities
along some segments. The posted speed limit on Imola Avenue is 35 mph. The City of Napa
characterizes this roadway as a "crucial corridor," which are defined as major corridors that
provide community-wide circulation. The City of Napa policy for this type of facility is to limit
development with direct access to these streets to uses generating less than 520 trips/day/acre.

Magnolia Drive / James Demer Drive are local roadways that provide access to the Napa State
Hospital and Napa Valley College, respectively.

Streblow Drive is a two lane local roadway that serves as the primary access for Napa Valley
College, John F. Kennedy Park and golf course and the Napa River.

Basalt Road is a private roadway that connects to SR 221 provides primary access to the Quarry
(the project site). Basalt Rd. is a two-lane road which extends in an east-west direction. Basalt
Road becomes Syar Industrial Way as it extends underneath SR 221 and heads west: Syar
Industrial Way ultimately connects to Kaiser Road (described below) at approximately the
western terminus of Kaiser Road. A 40 foot wide median break is in place at the intersection of
the project site entrance/driveway and SR 221. This median break allows vehicles exiting Basalt
Road to access to southbound SR 221 and vehicles travelling southbound on SR 221 to access
Basalt Road. On southbound SR 221, an approximate 400 350 foot- long acceleration lane is
provided for vehicles exiting Basalt Road and an approximate 33250- foot- long left turn laned is
provided for vehicles entering Basalt Road. On northbound SR221 an approximate 200- foot-
long acceleration lane is provided for vehicles exiting Basalt Road and an approximate 100- foot-
long deceleration lane is provided for vehicles entering Basalt Road.

Syar Way is a local roadway that connects Kaiser Road and Syar Industrial Way on the west side
of SR 221.

Kaiser Road connects to SR 221 south of Basalt Road. Between SR 221 and Basalt Road,
Kaiser Road travels in an east-west direction and provides four lanes and center left-turn lanes
and provides access to a number of light industrial and office uses.

Napa Valley Corporate Way is a north-south four-lane local roadway with landscaped median
and left-turn lanes at intersections which provides access to industrial and office uses. There are
Class II bicycle facilities but no sidewalks. The posted speed limit is 40 mph.

4.2       Existing Transit Service
The VINE is Napa Valley's fixed-route bus system, which provides service within the County
between the Cities of Calistoga, St. Helena, Yountville, Napa and American Canyon. The closest
bus stops to the Quarry are located approximately 0.9 miles to the north on James Demer Drive
for Routes 5 and 10. Route 5 service hours at Magnolia Drive and James Demer Drive are
approximately between 7:30 AM and 7:00 PM. Route 10 service hours at Magnolia Drive and
James Demer Drive are approximately between 6:30 AM and 9:00 PM.

The project site is also located near the Union Pacific Rail line. This rail line is used for heavy-
rail freight that services industrial land uses.

4.3       Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Bicycle and pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, crosswalks and multi-use trails. The
circulation element of the Napa County General Plan 2030 (Napa County, 2008) defines the
following bicycle facilities:

      ·   Class I Bike Paths are facilities specifically designated for the exclusive use of bicycles
          and pedestrians. Class I paths are separate from streets, but may cross roadways.
      ·   Class II Bike Paths are striped lanes on a street or highway designated for use by bicycles
          and typically designed using standards for pavement markings and signage. Vehicle
          parking and vehicle pedestrian cross-flows are permitted at designated locations.
      ·   Class III Bike Routes are usually designated by signs to indicate the use of bicycles
          within the vehicular travel lane of a roadway.

Both bicycle and pedestrian facilities are limited in the project study area. Bicycles and
pedestrians are prohibited along SR 29 and SR 12 between State Route 29/12/221/Soscol Ferry
Road intersection and the State Route 29/12 intersection and then continuing north along State
Route 29. There are no existing bicycle facilities on SR 221, however striped shoulders are
present on SR 221 throughout the study area, which are used by bicyclists. This route is planned
for future conversion to a Regional Bicycle Route with Class II bicycle lanes as described in the
Napa County Transportation & Planning Agency (NCTPA) County Wide Bicycle Plan (NCTPA,
2012). Class II bicycle lanes exist along Napa Valley Corporate Drive and Kaiser Road.
Sidewalks exist at most cross streets along SR 221 and at most intersections; however, very few
signalized intersections have pedestrian phases, with the exception of:

Winzler & Kelly's subcontractor, ATD, performed peak AM and PM traffic counts at the study
intersections on Tuesday, September 29, 2009. Traffic counts distinguished between vehicle
classes (passenger vehicles and heavy vehicles), bicycles, and pedestrians.
Table 4-1 summarizes bicycle and pedestrian volumes entering study intersections by approach
during the AM and PM peak hours, with pedestrian movements in parentheses. As indicated in
the table, there are very few bicyclists and pedestrians using the study intersections during the
peak hours.

4.4       Existing Sight Distance, Intersection Safety and Circulation
Intersection sight distance is the measurement of the clear line of sight between the driver of a
vehicle waiting at the crossroad and the driver of an approaching vehicle. The design standards
for intersection corner sight distance and decision sight distance applicable to this study are
provided in the Caltrans Highway Design Manual (Caltrans, 2006) and are summarized in Table
4-2 and Table 4-3, respectively.

The values for sight distance given above were applied at all signalized and unsignalized
intersections whenever possible. At intersections where a State Route turns or crosses another
State Route, the decision sight distance values given in Table 4-3 should be used. At all other
intersections, the intersection corner sight distance applies. Unanticipated vehicle conflicts can
occur due to signal malfunctions, violations of signals, right turns on red, and right of way
failures. Existing sight distance at all study intersections is acceptable.

Study intersection collision records were obtained from the California Highway Patrol (CHP)
Information Services Unit for the years 2004 through provisional 2008. The collisions were
compiled, analyzed and compared against the Basic Average Accident Rate for Intersections
(2007 Collision Data on California State Highways (road miles, travel, collisions, collisions
rates), (Caltrans, 2007). The collision rates are based on collisions per million entering vehicles
(MEV) for intersections based on control type and area. Average Daily Traffic (ADT) was
estimated based on ten percent of the peak hour, for the study intersections. The findings of this
analysis indicate that all study intersections collision rates are at or below the state average for
collisions within the intersections for the years 2004 through 2008, with exception of Intersection
No. 6 during the year 2006, which was slightly above the state average. For additional
information, the collision analysis is included in Appendix B.

The entrance to the Syar Quarry at Intersection No. 3 has had several improvements completed
to improve overall intersection safety, reduce the potential for collisions, and reduce the potential
for delays on SR 221 from trucks entering and exiting the Quarry near Basalt Road. These
improvements include a southbound left turn lane and northbound acceleration and deceleration

lanes on SR 221 at Basalt Road. These intersection geometrics allow trucks entering and exiting
the Quarry to move out of the main flow of traffic, improving safety and reducing delays. Figure
4-2 shows the details of Quarry entrance at Intersection No. 3.

4.5    Existing Intersection Configurations
The Existing lane configurations at the study intersections were obtained by observations in the
field and are shown on Figure 4-1. Detailed lane geometrics and control at Intersection No. 3,
which is the Syar Quarry entrance at SR 221 and Basalt Road, are shown on Figure 4-2.

4.6       Existing Traffic Volumes
Winzler & Kelly's subcontractor, ATD, performed peak AM and PM traffic counts at the study
intersections on Tuesday September 29, 2009 and on Wednesday October 7, 2009. Turning
movement counts distinguished between vehicle classes (passenger vehicles and heavy vehicles),
bicycles, and pedestrians. The traffic counts were conducted during a non-holiday week with
acceptable weather conditions, however the Quarry experienced higher than average production
for the day based on truck weigh scale tickets for this day compared with annual average data,
which was discussed in Chapter 3. The highest volume counts were used for the LOS analysis.

From the trip generation analysis discussed in Chapter 3, the selected trip generation rate for the
Quarry is based on production of approximately 3,350 tons/day, which generates 40 entering and
exiting trips during the AM peak hour of adjacent street traffic and two entering and exiting trips
during the PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic. The Quarry's sales during the day of the
intersection turning movement counts were approximately 4,469 tons/day and indicated that
there were 59 total entering and exiting trips during the AM peak hour (7:30 AM to 8:30 AM) if
adjacent street traffic and five entering and exiting trips during the PM peak hour (4:30 PM to
5:50 PM) of adjacent street traffic. Therefore, to normalize the existing traffic volumes for the
current average sales level, a net of 19 truck trips were removed from the AM peak hour existing
traffic volumes and three truck trips were removed from the PM peak hour existing traffic
volumes. Truck trips were assigned the same trip distribution percentages as those for the
project trips, which are shown in Figure 3-1.

The City of Napa Policy Guidelines: Traffic Level of Service (LOS) Criteria for Private
Development Review (City of Napa, 2004) requires that traffic counts reflect worst case mid-
week conditions during the month of August. The City provides multiplier factors for both day
of the week and month of the year to adjust counts to this condition. The traffic count utilized
for the TIS was conducted on Tuesday, September 29, 2009. The following factors were
multiplied by the count volumes to adjust the existing intersection volumes to mid-week in
August conditions:

      ·   Tuesday = 1.020
      ·   September = 1.037
      ·   Total Factor = 1.020 * 1.037 = 1.05774

The AM and PM peak hour intersection volumes at the study intersections are shown in Figure
4-3. The traffic count data is included in Appendix A of this report.

4.7       Existing Intersection Level of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under Existing conditions are summarized
in Table 4-4. The results show that, measured against the study thresholds of significance, all
study intersections currently operate at an acceptable LOS C or better during the AM and PM
peak hours with the exception of:

       ·   Int. No. 8 ­ SR 29/SR 12/SR 121 (AM Peak Hour/LOS F)

Although Intersection No. 6, 7 and 8 operate at LOS E or worse under existing conditions,
Caltrans and the City of Napa permit these intersections to operate at LOS F, as discussed in
Section 2.2.2.

Peak hour signal warrants are reviewed in the next section to evaluate if a signal is justified for
this intersection. Detailed calculation sheets for the Existing LOS for the study intersections are
found in Appendix C of this report.

4.8      Peak Hour Signal Warrant 3 for Intersection No. 3
Traffic Signal Warrant 3 for the peak hour of traffic is based on the California Manual of
Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CAMUTCD) (Caltrans, 2006). The Warrant has two Parts, A
and B that must both be met to justify the potential need for a signal based on the peak hour.
Part A contains three conditions, which are:

      1. The total delay experience by traffic on one minor street approach (one direction only)
         controlled by a STOP sign equals or exceeds four vehicle-hours for one-lane approach,
         or five vehicle-hours for a two-lane approach; AND
      2. The volume on the same minor street approach (one direction only) equals or exceeds
         100 vph for one moving lane of traffic or 150 vph for two moving lanes; AND
      3. The total entering volume serviced during the hour equals or exceeds 800 vph for
         intersections with four or more approaches or 650 vph for intersections with three
         approaches.

Part B of the traffic Signal Warrant 3 contains figures that plot minor street versus major street
approaches for urban and rural areas. The entire Signal Warrant 3 is included in Appendix D.

Based on a review of Signal Warrant 3 for the existing peak hour volumes, Intersection No. 3
does not meet Condition Part A, Number 1 of this signal warrant. However, this intersection
may meet other Signal Warrants, which would require further study to find if these Warrants are
met. The satisfaction of a traffic signal warrant or warrants does not in itself require the
installation of a traffic signal.

5.0    EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITION
This chapter describes the Existing Plus Project condition, potential significant impacts, and
recommended mitigation measures at the study intersections during the AM and PM peak hours.
Traffic volumes for this condition comprise volumes from Existing conditions with the addition
of traffic volumes generated from the project.

5.1    Existing Plus Project Intersection Configurations
It is assumed in this study that the transportation network under Existing Plus Project conditions
is the same as that used in the Existing conditions.

5.2    Existing Plus Project Traffic Volumes
Existing Plus Project volumes are represented by adding the project truck trips, shown in Table
3-4, to the Existing volumes. The Existing Plus Project traffic volumes are shown graphically on
Figure 5-1.

5.3    Existing Plus Project Intersection Level of Service
The Existing Plus Project condition intersection LOS results are summarized in Table 5-1. The
results show that, measured against the study thresholds of significance presented in Section
2.2.2, all study intersections would operate at an acceptable LOS C or better during the AM and
PM peak hours, with the exception of Intersection Nos. 3, 6, 7 and 8.
Traffic impacts are identified based on the projected LOS and average control delay for each
study intersection, as shown in Table 5-1. The minimum acceptable LOS thresholds for the study
intersections are discussed in Section 2.2.
Intersection No. 3 operates at an LOS E under existing conditions. The project contributes 51
trips to Intersection No.3 during the AM peak hour. This increase in traffic is a significant
impact.
The project is expected to contribute fewer than 50 peak hour trips to the existing LOS F
conditions in the AM and PM peak hours (45 AM peak hour trips and 3 PM peak hour trips) at
Intersection Nos. 6, 7 and 8. Because the project contributes fewer than 50 trips to these
intersections, there is no significant impact.

Detailed calculation sheets for the Existing Plus Project LOS for the study intersections are
found in Appendix E of this report.

5.4        Peak Hour Signal Warrant 3 for Intersection No. 3
Traffic Signal Warrant 3 for the peak hour of traffic was described in Section 4.8. Based on a
review of Signal Warrant 3 for the Existing Plus Project AM and PM peak hour volumes,
Intersection No. 3 meets this signal warrant. The satisfaction of a traffic signal warrant or
warrants does not in itself require the installation of a traffic signal.

Safety at Intersection No. 3 was reviewed and discussed in Section 4.4. The findings showed
that the intersection collision rates are at or below the state average for collisions in similar
intersections for the years 2004 through 2008.

5.5        Existing Plus Project Traffic Impact Mitigation
The project applicant (Syar) shall operate their sales activities to limit the number of new truck
trips entering and exiting the quarry during the AM peak hour to no more than 50.

A dedicated Syar staff coordinator would be required to implement and monitor truck trips in
accordance with this limit and report to the county annually regarding compliance. Additionally,
it is recommended that permanent traffic count and classifiers be installed within the public
right-of-way so that reported trip information can be verified.

Limiting the number of new truck trips entering and exiting the quarry at Intersection No. 3 by
limiting sales activities during the AM peak hour to, limit the number of new truck trips leaving
the quarry at Intersection No. 3 during the AM peak hour to 50 or fewer trips would reduce the
impact to less-than-significant based on the LOS thresholds for the study intersections discussed
in Section 2.2.

6.0    FUTURE CONDITION

This Chapter describes the Future (cumulative) conditions at the study intersections during the
AM and PM peak hours. Traffic volumes for this condition comprise volumes adjusted for
planned growth to the year 2030. Future conditions account for increases in traffic due to
General Plan build-out and regional growth.

6.1    Future Intersection Configurations
It is assumed in this study that the transportation network under Future conditions is the same as
that used in the Existing condition and is representative of the existing roadway network under
Existing Plus Project conditions.

6.2    Future Traffic Volumes
Future peak hour traffic volumes were estimated using the cumulative condition traffic analysis
conducted for the Napa Pipe project in the Napa Pipe Draft EIR (County of Napa, 2009). This
analysis was conducted using the Solano Transportation Authority (STA) Napa-Solano Travel
Demand Model. The model has been validated for the Counties of Napa and Solano, is
consistent with NCTPA requirements, and is used to project future travel demands on the
roadway network. The Napa Pipe project cumulative analysis was used, along with the Napa
Pipe project trip generation, to maintain consistency between the two project environmental
documents.

From discussions with the Napa Pipe EIR Traffic Impact Study consultant the traffic forecasts
for the Napa Pipe TIS cumulative analyses included a total of 50 additional peak hour truck trips
associated with the Syar Napa Quarry operations. In this TIS these peak hour truck trips were
removed from the Napa Pipe TIS cumulative traffic volumes, based on the project trip
distribution shown in Figure 3-1, resulting in the cumulative (future) volumes without the Napa
Syar Quarry project.

Mitigation Measure PS-3 of the Napa Pipe EIR Supplement (County of Napa, 2010) reserves a
10-acre site within the Napa Pipe project area for a future Napa Valley Unified School District
(NVUSD) elementary school. The number and impact of vehicle trips expected to and from the
Napa Pipe site are analyzed in Chapter 4.3 of the 2009 DEIR, and included trips associated with
children going to and from school outside of the Napa Pipe project area, as well as parents
picking up and dropping off their children. The 2009 DEIR analysis already included trip
generation associated with school-related trips, and assumes those trips are disbursed throughout
the street network, rather than concentrated (for elementary school children) at the school site.
The reservation of a new school site within the Napa Pipe project area could have the effect of
terminating elementary school-related trips close to the Napa Pipe project site, lessening their
effect on other parts of the road network. In the event NVUSD decides to acquire the site for
development as a school, NVUSD would perform site specific analysis of the traffic impacts
associated with the proposed school. Therefore, traffic and transportation impacts would be as
described in the Napa Pipe DEIR analysis.

Future traffic volumes are shown on Figure 6-1.

6.3         Future Intersection Level of Service
Future condition intersection LOS results are summarized in Table 6-1. The results show that,
measured against the study thresholds of significance, all study intersections operate at an
unacceptable LOS during the future AM and PM peak hours.

Most study intersections operate an unacceptable LOS F during the Future Condition, which
indicates that additional operating capacity is needed. As discussed in Section 2.2.2, the City of
Napa and Caltrans permit Intersection No. 6, 7 and 8 to operate at an LOS F. The study roadway
network consists of State Routes, and requires project initiation documents to formalize an
investigation of the operational deficiencies of the intersections, and perhaps the corridor as a
whole, which is outside of the scope of this analysis. Currently, there are no programmed or
funded capacity improvements scheduled for implementation along the SR 221 corridor, with
exception to the southbound left-turn fly over at Intersection No. 6. The flyover ramp provides a
direct route for the traffic traveling from southbound SR 221 (Napa-Vallejo Highway) to
southbound SR 12/SR 29. This improvement has been contemplated previously by the County
and Caltrans, and will likely be needed with or without the project.

The detailed calculation sheets for the Future LOS for the study intersections are found in
Appendix F of this report.

7.0    FUTURE PLUS PROJECT CONDITION

This Chapter describes the Future Plus Project conditions, potentially significant impacts, and
recommended mitigation measures for the study intersections during the AM and PM peak
hours. This scenario is representative of traffic conditions expected at the year 2030 with the
addition of project generated trips. Future Plus Project conditions also include future increases
in traffic due to General Plan build-out and regional growth.

7.1    Future Plus Project Intersection Configurations
It is assumed in this study that the transportation network under Future Plus Project conditions is
the same as that used in Future conditions and is representative of the existing roadway network
under Existing Plus Project conditions.

7.2    Future Plus Project Traffic Volumes
Future Plus Project volumes are represented by adding the project truck trips, shown in Table
3-4, to the Future volumes. The Future Plus Project traffic volumes are shown on Figure 7-1.

7.3    Future Plus Project Intersection Level of Service
Future Plus Project condition intersection LOS results are summarized in Table 7-1. The results
show that, measured against the study thresholds of significance, all study intersections operate
at an unacceptable LOS E or worse during the AM and PM peak hours.

Traffic impacts are identified based on the projected LOS and average control delay for each
study intersection, as shown in Table 7-1. The minimum acceptable LOS thresholds for the study
intersections are described in Section 2.2.2.

The AM peak hour LOS at all intersections was unacceptable during Future conditions, as
described in Chapter 6, and remains unacceptable under Future Plus Project conditions. Future
impacts to which the project contributes considerable traffic volumes are identified, and
mitigations are recommended, where feasible, to reduce future impacts to less than significant
levels.

Intersection No. 3 operates at an LOS F under future conditions. The project contributes 51 trips
to Intersection No. 3 during the AM peak hour. This increase in traffic volumes is a significant
impact. The project is expected to contribute fewer than 50 peak hour trips to the future LOS F
conditions in the AM and PM peak hours at all other study intersections. Because the project
contributes fewer than 50 trips to these intersections, there is no significant impact.

Detailed calculation sheets for the Future Plus Project LOS for the study intersections are found
in Appendix G of this report.

7.4      Future Plus Project Traffic Impact Mitigation
The project applicant (Syar) shall operate their sales activities to limit the number of new truck
trips entering and exiting the quarry during the AM peak hour to no more than 50.

A dedicated Syar staff coordinator would be required to implement and monitor truck trips in
accordance with this limit and report to the county annually regarding compliance. Additionally,
it is recommended that permanent traffic count and classifiers be installed within the public
right-of-way so that reported trip information can be verified.

Limiting the number of new truck trips entering and exiting the quarry at Intersection No. 3 by
limiting sales activities during the AM peak hour to, limit the number of new truck trips leaving
the quarry at Intersection No. 3 during the AM peak hour to 50 or fewer trips would reduce the
impact to less-than-significant based on the LOS thresholds for the study intersections discussed
in Section 2.2.

8.0    CONCLUSIONS

The potential impacts of the proposed project were evaluated using the standards and
methodologies set forth by the County of Napa, the City of Napa and Caltrans. The study
analyzed eight intersections for the AM and PM peak hour traffic. The results of the intersection
level of service analysis for the study scenarios are summarized in Table 8-1.

Based on the intersection level of service analysis results, the project was found to have a
significant impact on study Intersection No. 3 in the Existing Plus Project and Future Plus
Project conditions.

The project applicant (Syar Industries, Inc.) shall operate their sales activities to limit the number
of new truck trips entering and exiting the quarry during the AM peak hour to no more than 50.

Alternatively, the project applicant could establish a transportation demand management (TDM)
program which limits the number of new truck trips leaving the quarry at Intersection No. 3
during the AM peak hour to no more than 50.

Limiting the number of new truck trips entering and exiting the quarry at Intersection No. 3 by
limiting sales activities during the AM peak hour, or implementation of a TDM program which
would limit the number of new truck trips leaving the quarry at Intersection No. 3 during the AM
peak hour to 50 or fewer trips would reduce the impact to less-than-significant based on the LOS
thresholds for the study intersections discussed in Section 2.2.

The intersection will continue to function poorly in the Future Plus Project (cumulative)
scenario, but Syar's contribution would be addressed by the above project-specific mitigation. If
the County locates a proposed jail adjacent to the quarry site, the jail would share a common
driveway with the quarry and add additional traffic to Intersection No. 3. As a result, the jail
project would implement mitigation in the form of intersection signalization. If the jail project
and Intersection No. 3 signalization occurs, the project-specific mitigation measure discussed
above for the quarry would no longer be needed and the impact would be reduced to less-than-
significant.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

OVERVIEW
The purpose of this report is to identify the potential traffic impact associated with
development of University Commons in the Town of Allegany, Cattaraugus County,
New York. This report investigates the existing and projects the future weekday PM and
Saturday Midday peak hour travel conditions at the site access drives and adjacent
intersections affected by the development for Full Development conditions. The
operating characteristics of the access points and impacts to the adjacent roadway
network are identified.

The proposed site is currently occupied by primarily vacant buildings, such as: motel,
movie theatre, and restaurants. There are six residential houses that will be removed as
part of the proposed development. All existing and vacant uses on the site will be razed
under the current proposal. St. Bonaventure University is on the south side of Route
417 across from the development, and there are some residential houses bordering the
site to the east and north. The site is currently zoned commercial, with the exception
of the six existing residential houses.

The study area consists of five existing intersections. A comprehensive inventory of the
existing roadway network operations was developed and peak period traffic volume
data were obtained by SRF & Associates (SRF).

The Town of Allegany was contacted to discuss current projects within the project
study area that are under construction and/or approved developments. No projects
within or adjacent to the study area were identified. A background growth rate was
derived based on current development in the area as well as historical growth rates
determined using historical NYSDOT traffic volume information.

Site generated traffic volumes for the proposed development are projected and
distributed to the network based on existing travel patterns, population centers, and
existing highway conditions.

The operating characteristics of the proposed access points and impacts to the adjacent
roadway network are identified and mitigating measures are provided to minimize any
capacity or safety concerns.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report addresses the traffic impact that can be expected from the University
Commons development in the Town of Allegany as described in this report. It has been
shown that upon completion of recommended mitigation measures, the transportation
network can adequately accommodate the projected traffic volumes and resulting
impacts to study area intersections, without significant adverse impacts to traffic
operations

The following list details specific recommendations to be considered as a result of this
development:

   1. Provide an eastbound left turn lane on Route 417 at the westerly site driveway
      by re-striping the existing two-way left turn lane. The turn lane should be
      constructed to 305' in length (230' of storage plus a 75' bay taper).

   2. Provide an eastbound left turn lane on Route 417 at the proposed middle site
      driveway by re-striping the existing two-way left turn lane. The turn lane should
      be constructed to 305' in length (230' of storage plus a 75' bay taper).

   3. Construct a westbound right turn lane at the proposed middle site driveway on
      Route 417. The turn lane should be constructed to 305' in length (230' of
      storage plus a 75' bay taper).

   4. Install a 3 color, two-phase traffic signal at the proposed middle site drive
      intersection with Route 417.

   5. The proposed west site drive on Route 417 should be constructed with two
      lanes exiting and one lane entering to accommodate the appropriate design
      vehicle, and be stop sign controlled.

   6. The proposed middle site drive on Route 417 should be constructed with two
      lanes exiting (a left turn lane and one shared through/right turn lane) and one
      lane entering to accommodate the appropriate design vehicle.

   7. The proposed east site drive on Route 417 should be constructed with one lane
      exiting and one lane entering to accommodate appropriate design vehicle, and be
      stop sign controlled.

   8. All recommended roadway and intersection improvements along Route 417 are
      subject to review and approval by the New York State Department of
      Transportation (NYSDOT).

I.     INTRODUCTION

       The purpose of this report is to identify the potential traffic impact associated
       with the proposed University Commons development in the Town of Allegany,
       Cattaraugus County, New York. The operating characteristics of the proposed
       access points and impacts to the adjacent roadway network are identified.

       In an effort to define traffic impact, this analysis determines the extent of existing
       traffic conditions, projects background traffic flow including area growth, and
       projects changes in traffic flow due to operation of the proposed development.

II.    PROJECT LOCATION AND STUDY AREA

       The proposed site is located on the north side of NY Route 417, west of Willard
       Road, east of Constitution Avenue, and directly opposite Francis Drive. The site
       is currently occupied by various buildings, some of which are vacant. The site
       location and study area are illustrated in Figure 1 ­ Site Location and Study
       Area (all figures are included in Section XII. at the end of this report).

       The study area consists of five existing intersections surrounding the project site.
       St. Bonaventure University is on the south side of Route 417 across from the
       development, and there are some residential houses bordering the site to the
       east and north. The site is currently zoned commercial, with the exception of
       the six existing residential houses.

III.   EXISTING HIGHWAY SYSTEM

       Five existing intersections are studied in detail in this Report; they include the
       following:

           ·   Cranberry Road / Constitution Avenue
           ·   Constitution Avenue ­ St. Bonaventure driveway / NY Route 417
           ·   NY Route 417 / Francis Drive
           ·   NY Route 417 / Willard Street
           ·   NY Route 417 / WalMart plaza driveway ­ Gargoyle Park Road

       Route 417, also known as West State Street within the vicinity of the project, is
       an east-west principal arterial type highway with a posted speed limit of 35 MPH.
       The highway section consists of one 12-foot wide traffic lane in each direction
       with a two-way center lane. The intersections of Route 417 with WalËMart and
       Constitution Avenue are controlled by traffic signals. According to the most
       recent volume data collected by the New York State Department of
       Transportation (NYSDOT) in 2001, the annual average daily traffic (AADT)
       along Route 417 between County Route 19 and the Olean West city line was
       11,200 and projected to be 11,300 vehicles per day (vpd) in 2003.


                                            1                                   August 2005
Traffic Impact Study             University Commons                Town of Allegany, NY


       Constitution Avenue is a Town road that extends from Route 417 on the west
       to Buffalo Street on the east. Constitution Avenue serves as a bypass to Route
       417 on the west side of Olean. The roadway consists of one lane in each
       direction and a posted speed limit of 35 MPH within the Town of Allegany and
       30 MPH within the City of Olean.

IV.    EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

       A.     Peak Intervals for Analysis

              Given the functional characteristics of the corridor and the land use
              proposed for the site (primarily retail/commercial development), the peak
              hours selected for analysis are the weekday PM and Saturday midday
              peaks. The combination of site traffic and adjacent through traffic
              produces the greatest demand during these time periods.

       B.     Existing Traffic Volume Data
              Weekday PM (3:30-5:30pm) and Saturday midday (11:30am-1:30pm) peak
              traffic counts were obtained by SRF & Associates (SRF) at the study area
              intersections identified above.

              Existing count data was collected by SRF at the study area intersections
              on Friday April 8, 2005 and Saturday April 9, 2005, with the exception of
              the Francis drive / NY Route 417 intersection. Turning movement
              counts in and out of the drive were estimated based on the facilities on
              the St. Bonaventure campus and traffic volumes at adjacent intersections.
              Data was not collected at this intersection due to modifications to the
              proposed site plan. When it was determined that Francis Drive
              intersection needed to be counted, classes at the university were already
              out for the summer. The peak hour traffic periods generally occurred
              between 3:30 to 4:30 PM and 12:00 to 1:00 PM. The existing peak hour
              volumes are depicted in Figure 2.

              All turning movement count data was collected on typical
              weekdays/weekends while St. Bonaventure University had classes in
              session. All traffic volumes were reviewed to confirm the accuracy and
              relative balance of the collective traffic counts. All traffic volumes were
              found to balance within the network within reasonable and expected
              variations.

       C.     Field Observations at Study Area Intersections

              All intersections included in the project area were observed during peak
              intervals to assess existing traffic operating conditions at each
              intersection. Signal timing information was collected, at the previously


                                          2                                 August 2005
Traffic Impact Study              University Commons                 Town of Allegany, NY


              identified signalized intersections, to determine peak hour phasing plans
              and phase durations during each interval. This information was used to
              support and/or calibrate capacity analysis models described in detail later
              in this report.

       D.     Existing Operational Analysis

              Capacity analysis is used for estimating the traffic carrying ability of
              facilities over a range of pre-determined operational conditions. The main
              objective of the analysis is to estimate the maximum number of persons
              or vehicles that a facility (intersection or roadway segment) can
              accommodate during a specific time period.

              Intersecting roadways generally provide the initial constraint on a facilities
              capacity. Efficiency at the intersections becomes the critical constraint for
              capacity. Vehicle interactions at these points must therefore be analyzed
              to assess the projected capacity levels. The standard procedure for
              capacity analysis of unsignalized intersections is outlined in the 2000
              Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2000) published by the Transportation
              Research Board. Traffic analysis software, Synchro 6, which is based on
              procedures and methodologies contained in the HCM 2000, was used to
              analyze operating conditions at study area intersections. The procedure
              yields a Level of Service (LOS) based on the HCM 2000 as an indicator of
              how well intersections operate. Level of Service is a quality measure
              describing operational conditions in terms of service measures such as
              freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort, convenience, speed,
              and travel time.

              The concept of Level of Service is defined as a qualitative measure
              describing operating conditions within a traffic stream, and their
              perception by motorists and/or passengers. Six Levels of Service are
              defined for analysis purposes. They are assigned letter designations, from
              "A" to "F", with LOS "A" representing the best conditions and LOS "F"
              the most amount of delay. Suggested ranges of service capacity and an
              explanation of Levels of Service are included in the attachment to this
              letter. The following Levels of Service (LOS) resulted from this analysis:

        E.      Existing Accident Investigation

                Accident reports for the intersections along Route 417 and Constitution
                Avenue were investigated to assess the safety history. The accidents
                included in the current review occurred during a three-year time period
                from June 1, 1999 through March 31, 2005. This is the most recent
                accident data available, as provided by NYSDOT, Village of Allegany, and
                Cattaraugus County Sheriff. During this period, 16 accidents were
                documented at the intersections along Route 417 and Constitution
                Avenue included in the study area.

                The accident history was further investigated to identify high incident
                areas and possible trends/causes of the accidents. Table II summarizes
                accidents occurring at each intersection. Based on the number of
                accidents at each intersection, accident rates were calculated and
                compared to the statewide average for similar facilities. The calculated
                rates and comparison to statewide averages are also summarized in Table
                II. Accident rate calculations are included in the Appendix. Intersection
                rates are listed as accidents per million entering vehicles (ACC/MEV).

                All of the intersections included in the accident investigation are less than
                the state wide average accident rate, as shown above, therefore no
                further investigation is necessary.

V.      FUTURE AREA DEVELOPMENT AND LOCAL GROWTH

        Construction of the proposed development is anticipated within two years
        (2007). Town of Allegany officials were contacted to discuss current projects
        within the town and project study area that are currently approved and/or under
        construction. No nearby developments were identified.



                                             5                                  August 2005
Traffic Impact Study              University Commons                 Town of Allegany, NY


       To account for normal increases in background traffic growth, including any
       unforeseen developments in the project study area, a growth rate of 1.0% has
       been applied to the existing traffic volumes along Route 417 for the two year
       build-out period. The background traffic volumes are depicted in Figure 3.
       Supporting documentation is included in the appendix of this report.

VI.    PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

       A.     Description
              The proposed site is currently occupied by primarily vacant buildings,
              such as: motel, movie theatre, and restaurants. There are six residential
              houses that will be removed as part of the proposed development. All
              existing and vacant uses on the site will be razed under the current
              proposal.

              The proposed development consists of a mix of uses including retail,
              office, residential, and restaurants. The sizes of proposed uses on site
              are as follows:

                  ·    Office ­ 54,900 square feet
                  ·    Retail ­ 126,460 square feet
                  ·    Restaurants ­ 4 @ 6,000 square feet each
                  ·    Apartments ­ 20 units

              Access to the site will be provided via three proposed driveways; all on
              NY Route 417. The main site drive will form a four way intersection
              with Francis Drive. It is expected that the proposed eastern site drive on
              NY Route 417 will be used primarily by delivery trucks to the rear of the
              proposed buildings.

              The access for the proposed 20 unit apartment building is from Castle
              Road. No connection is proposed from the main development along
              Route 417 to Castle Road.

       B.     Site Traffic Generation
              The next step in the evaluation is to determine the additional traffic
              attributable to the development as defined, vehicle trips entering and
              exiting the site. Trip Generation, 7th Edition, published by the Institute of
              Transportation Engineers (ITE), is used as a reference for this
              information. The trip rate for the peak hour of the generator may or may
              not coincide in time or volume with the trip rate for the peak hour of
              adjacent street traffic. Volumes generated during the peak hour of
              adjacent street traffic, in this case, the PM and Saturday peaks, represent



                                           6                                  August 2005
Traffic Impact Study              University Commons                Town of Allegany, NY


              a more critical volume when analyzing the capacity of the system; those
              intervals will provide the basis of this analysis.

              The volume of traffic generated by a site is dependent on the intended
              land use and size of the development. Trip generation can be defined as
              an estimate of the number of trips generated by a specific building or land
              use. These trips represent the volume of new traffic added to the
              roadways due to the proposed development as well as traffic diverted
              from the existing traffic stream and other on-site land uses.

              The volume of site-generated traffic at the proposed access drives has
              been estimated based on data contained in the Trip Generation, 7th
              Edition manual. All trip generation information has been included in the
              appendix to illustrate the different uses.

       C.     Determination of Multi-use Trips
              Inherent in the trip generation estimate for the proposed development, is
              the "multi-use" traffic component of traffic entering and exiting the site.
              According to the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation
              Handbook, 2001, "...a multi-use development is typically a single real-
              estate project that consists of two or more ITE land use classifications
              between which trips can be made without using the off-site road system.
              Because of the nature of these land uses, the trip-making characteristics
              are interrelated, and some trips are made among the on-site uses. This
              capture of trips internal to the site has the net effect of reducing vehicle
              trip generation between the overall development site and the external
              street system (compared to the total number of trips generated by
              comparable, stand alone sites)." "In some multi-use developments, these
              internal trips can be made by walking or by vehicle entirely on internal
              pathways or internal roadways without using streets external to the site."

              The ITE Trip Generation Handbook indicates internal capture rates for
              trips within a multi-use development to be 20% between two retail uses
              during the PM peak hour. Given the area in which this site is located, and
              interconnection between adjacent parcels, multi-use (or multiple
              purpose) trips are likely to occur. Therefore it is estimated, based on
              methods in ITE Trip Generation Handbook, that an 11% (7%) reduction
              in total trip generation for the site will occur for the PM (SAT) peak
              hours, respectively.

       D.     Determination of Pass-by Trips
              For certain types of developments, the total number of trips generated is
              different from the amount of new traffic added to the adjacent highway
              network by the generator. Retail-oriented developments (such as
              shopping centers, discount stores, restaurants, banks, service stations,

                                          7                                  August 2005
Traffic Impact Study               University Commons                  Town of Allegany, NY


              and convenience markets) often locate adjacent to busy streets in order
              to attract the motorists already passing the site on the adjacent street.
              These sites attract a portion of their trips from traffic passing the site.

              Trips generated by a retail-type use can be broken down into two
              categories: pass-by trips and primary trips. The "pass-by" traffic refers to
              the amount of existing traffic already on the roadway adjacent to the site
              (in this case NYS Route 417) that, as it "passes by" the site, will enter the
              site driveways to patronize the project site. That portion of the
              generated traffic attracted to the site would pass on the adjacent street
              system (Route 417) whether or not the site is developed and thus
              produces no new traffic at study area intersections other than the site
              driveways.

              ITE data indicates that pass-by rates for shopping centers can vary from
              10% to as high as 80% during the PM peak hour. Given the nature of the
              surrounding area and considering the location of the site on Route 417,
              pass-by rates of 30% and 20% were used during the PM and Saturday
              peak periods, respectively, for analysis purposes in this report.

              The percentage reduction for multi-use trips was applied to the total site
              generated traffic resulting in the total driveway traffic (i.e. traffic that will
              actually enter and exit the site). Pass-by trip reductions were then applied
              to the driveway trips. Table III shows the total site generated trips, multi-
              use trips, driveway trips, pass-by trips, and resulting primary trips that are
              added to the existing highway system for full development of the project.

              The trip generation volumes for the proposed apartments have been
              shown separately in the following table because there is no proposed
              connection between the apartments and the main development area
              along Route 417.

       E.        Site Traffic Distribution
                 The cumulative effect of site traffic on the transportation network is
                 dependent on the origins and destinations of that traffic and the location
                 of the access drives serving the site.

                 The proposed arrival/departure distribution of traffic to be generated at
                 this site is considered a function of several parameters, including the
                 following:

                               Population centers in the area
                               Existing highway network
                               Existing traffic conditions and controls
                               Site access drive locations

                 Figure 4 shows the anticipated trip distribution pattern percentages for
                 full build-out of the main development area of the proposed site along
                 Route 417. Figure 5 shows the anticipated trip generation pattern for
                 the proposed apartment building along Castle Road. Figure 6 shows the
                 resulting total site generated traffic (including pass-by trips and residential
                 trips) as assigned to the site driveways and study area intersections for


                                                   9                                August 2005
Traffic Impact Study             University Commons               Town of Allegany, NY


              full build-out (including the apartments) weekday PM and Saturday
              midday peak hour periods.

       F.     Projected Future Traffic Volumes
              The projected design hour traffic volumes for the development were
              created for each peak by combining background conditions (Figure 3)
              with the projected site generated volumes (Figure 6) to yield the traffic
              conditions under full development conditions. Figure 7 shows the total
              weekday PM and Saturday midday peak hour volumes anticipated for the
              proposed development at full build out conditions.

VII.   OPERATIONAL ANALYSES
       The background and future traffic conditions generated by the proposed
       development were analyzed to assess the operations of the access drives, and
       adjacent roadway network contained in the study area. The intersection capacity
       results are shown in Table IV. The discussion following the tables summarizes
       the background and proposed capacity conditions.

       "C" or better during both background and full development conditions for both
       PM and Saturday periods studied. The Saturday full development levels of
       service reflect revised signal timings that are within the parameters of the
       existing actuated traffic signal. Therefore, no mitigation is required at this
       intersection as a result of the proposed project.

       Route 417 / Constitution Avenue
       Although the overall intersection LOS decreases from "B" to "C" from
       background to full development conditions under PM peak conditions, the
       intersection will operate at LOS "C" or better on all approaches during both PM
       and Saturday peak periods for background and full development conditions.
       Therefore, no mitigation is required at this intersection as a result of the
       proposed project.

       Cranberry Road / Constitution Avenue
       All approach levels of service are shown to be LOS "B" or better during
       background and full development conditions for PM and Saturday peak periods
       studied.

       SITE ACCESS DRIVES

       Route 417 / Main site drive ­ Francis Drive
       The southbound approach will operate at LOS "E" and "F" under PM and
       Saturday, respectively, for full development conditions with a stop sign on the
       main site drive. This condition could be mitigated with the installation of a traffic
       signal, which would increase the levels of service to "B" or better during the PM
       and Saturday conditions. The warrants for a traffic signal are studied in detail in
       the following sections of this report.

       Route 417 / West site drive
       The proposed site drive intersection with Route 417 will operate as LOS "D" on
       the southbound approach for vehicles exiting the development. Delays of this
       magnitude are common on the minor street approach at unsignalized
       intersections along Route 417. Although signalization of this intersection would
       provide a protected vehicular right-of-way movement for the minor street
       approach, it would not be appropriate at these locations for the following
       reasons:

           ·   It is unlikely that minor approach (site drive) traffic volumes would meet
               minimum required volume and delay warrants,
           ·   Additional significant delay would be incurred to east and westbound
               motorists on the major street (Route 417),
           ·   New traffic signal at the proposed main site driveway-Francis Drive on
               Route 417 will create gaps for vehicles exiting the west site drive

        It is recommended that the existing two-way left turn lane be re-striped to an
        exclusive left turn lane entering the proposed west site drive. The warrants for
        an exclusive turn lane are discussed in the following sections of this report.

        Route 417 / East site drive
        The proposed site drive intersection is shown to operate at LOS "C" or better
        during the PM and Saturday peak periods.

VIII.   SIGHT DISTANCE INVESTIGATION

        Sight distances were investigated along Route 417 at the proposed access
        intersections. Sight distance is provided at intersections to allow drivers to
        perceive the presence of potentially conflicting vehicles. This should occur in
        sufficient time for a motorist to stop or adjust their speed, as appropriate, to
        avoid a collision at the intersection. Sight distance is also provided at
        intersections to allow the drivers of stopped vehicles a sufficient view of the
        intersecting highway to anticipate and avoid potential incidents. If the available
        sight distance for an entering or crossing vehicle is at least equal to the
        appropriate stopping sight distance for the major road, then drivers have
        sufficient sight distance to anticipate and avoid collisions. To enhance traffic
        operations, intersection sight distances that exceed stopping sight distances are
        desirable along the major road.

        The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials'
        (AASHTO) 2004 A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets was
        used as a reference to establish the required stopping sight distance and
        desirable intersection sight distance for the site access drive(s) intersections with
        Route 417.

        Required stopping distances and desirable intersection sight distances are based
        on the design speed for a given section of roadway, generally the design speed is
        the posted speed limit + 5 MPH. In this case, the posted speed limit along Route
        417 is 35MPH. NYSDOT performed a speed study along Route 417 within the
        project site in August 2004 and found the 85th percentile speed to be 39.9 MPH
        in the eastbound direction and 40.7 MPH in the westbound direction. Hence the
        design speed of 40 MPH was used along Route 417. The required stopping
        distance and desirable intersection sight distance based on the design speed is
        shown in Table V.




                                            13                                  August 2005

@ Route 417

              The available sight distances to the left and right are in excess of the
              desirable requirements for the proposed site drive intersections as
              shown in the table above.

IX.    AUXILIARY TURN LANE EVALUATION
       A.     LEFT TURN LANES

              Volume warrants for eastbound left turn lanes at the proposed site drives
              along Route 417 were investigated for full development conditions using
              the Transportation Research Board's National Cooperative Highway
              Research Program (NCHRP) Report 279, Intersection Channelization
              Design Guide, 1985. The maximum critical volumes projected under full
              development conditions are contained in the appendix of this report.

              Provisions for left turn lane facilities should be established where traffic
              volumes are high enough and safety considerations are sufficient to
              warrant the additional lane. The combination of projected volumes
              turning left into the new access drives suggests that a left turn lane is
              warranted under the full development conditions at all three proposed
              driveways.     Due to the existing two-way left turn lane present along
              Route 417 in front of the site, it is recommended that the two-way left
              turn lane be re-striped as an exclusive left turn lane at the westerly and
              middle site drives. Although the warrants for a left turn lane are met at
              the easterly site drive, it is recommended that the existing two-way left
              turn lane should remain as is, due to the projected low turning volume
              into that drive.

              Therefore, it is recommended that a 305' (230' storage and 75' taper)
              eastbound left turn lane be installed on Route 417 at the west and middle
              site driveway.     The recommended dimensions will accommodate
              deceleration based on an approach speed of 40 MPH.

                                           14                                  August 2005
Traffic Impact Study                University Commons               Town of Allegany, NY




       B.     RIGHT TURN LANES

              Volume warrants for westbound right turn lanes at the proposed site
              drives along Route 417 were investigated using the Transportation
              Research Board's NCHRP Report 279, Intersection Channelization
              Design Guide, 1985. The maximum critical volumes projected under full
              development conditions are contained in the appendix of this report.

              The combination of projected volumes on Route 417 under full
              development conditions suggest that a westbound right turn lane is
              warranted at the main site drive intersection. As such, it is recommended
              that a 305' (230' storage and 75' taper) westbound right turn lane be
              installed on Route 417. The recommended dimensions will accommodate
              deceleration based on an approach speed of 40 MPH.

              Warrants for a right turn lane at the west and easterly site drive are not
              met during full development conditions. As such, a westbound right turn
              lane at these intersections is not recommended.

X.     TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANT INVESTIGATION

       A potential capacity deficiency has been identified on the southbound approach
       at the proposed new site driveway (opposite Francis Drive) intersection with
       Route 417 during both peak hours during full development conditions as noted
       in the previous section of the report. A traffic signal could mitigate the
       deficiency; a detailed signal warrant investigation was performed to identify if
       threshold values are met.

       The need for a traffic signal is determined by comprehensive investigation of
       existing and projected traffic conditions and physical characteristics at the
       location. The New York State Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices
       (MUTCD) has set forth warrants to investigate the need for a traffic control
       signal. The eleven warrants are as follows:

                       Warrant 1      Minimum vehicular volume
                       Warrant 2      Interruption of continuous traffic
                       Warrant 3      Minimum pedestrian volumes
                       Warrant 4      School crossing
                       Warrant 5      Progressive movement
                       Warrant 6      Accident experience
                       Warrant 7      Systems warrant
                       Warrant 8      Combination of warrants
                       Warrant 9      Four hour volumes
                       Warrant 10     Peak hour delay
                       Warrant 11     Peak hour volume

                                           15                                August 2005
Traffic Impact Study              University Commons                 Town of Allegany, NY




       These warrants and their criteria are fully explained in the MUTCD. The
       investigation will first focus on all warrants that are based exclusively on traffic
       volumes.

       Warrants 1 and 2 are satisfied when, for each of any eight hours of an average
       day, anticipated volumes on the artery and side road are in excess of the
       minimum values presented in the MUTCD. Hourly traffic volumes expected
       under full development conditions along Route 417 at the site drive intersection
       were projected based on the actual hourly traffic distribution measured by
       NYSDOT along Route 417 in the vicinity of the proposed project. Hourly traffic
       volumes expected to exit the site drive were projected based on the typical
       hourly distribution of similar retail facilities. Based upon these calculations,
       Warrants 1 and 2 are met. Detailed signal warrant calculations are attached.

       Warrant 9 stipulates that for any four hours of a day, minimum threshold
       volumes are met on the artery and side road. Based on the projected hourly
       traffic volumes, this warrant will be met under full development conditions.

       Warrant 10 is intended for application where minor street traffic suffers undue
       delay in entering or crossing the major street for one hour of the day. This
       warrant is satisfied when the following conditions exist for one hour of an
       average week day with a two-lane side road approach: 1) Total delay on the side
       road approach equals or exceeds five vehicle hours, 2) The volume on the same
       side road approach equals or exceeds 150 vph, and 3) The total entering volume
       serviced during the hour equals or exceeds 800 vph. It is impossible to predict
       delay at the intersection in question as the volumes are projected. It is clear that
       both of the minimum threshold volumes will be exceeded based on the
       projected traffic volumes.

       Warrant 11 is also intended for application where minor street traffic suffers
       undue delay in entering or crossing the major street for one hour of the day. It
       stipulates that for one hour of a day, minimum threshold volumes are met on the
       artery and side road. Both conditions are satisfied during the PM peak interval
       under full development conditions.

       The results of the traffic signal warrant investigation are summarized in Table VI
       below, and detailed signal warrant analyses are included in the appendix.

       Based on the traffic signal warrant investigation, the five traffic signal warrants
       that deal strictly with vehicular volumes are met. Given the projected level of
       service on the site driveway and the high turning traffic volumes, signalization of
       this intersection is recommended.

XI.     CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

        This report addresses the traffic impact that can be expected from the
        University Commons development in the Town of Allegany as described in this
        report. It has been shown that upon completion of recommended mitigation
        measures, the transportation network can adequately accommodate the
        projected traffic volumes and resulting impacts to study area intersections,
        without significant adverse impacts to traffic operations

        The following list details specific recommendations to be considered as a result
        of this development:

              1. Provide an eastbound left turn lane on Route 417 at the westerly site
                 driveway by re-striping the existing two-way left turn lane. The turn lane
                 should be constructed to 305' in length (230' of storage plus a 75' bay
                 taper).

              2. Provide an eastbound left turn lane on Route 417 at the proposed middle
                 site driveway by re-striping the existing two-way left turn lane. The turn
                 lane should be constructed to 305' in length (230' of storage plus a 75'
                 bay taper).

              3. Construct a westbound right turn lane at the proposed middle site
                 driveway on Route 417. The turn lane should be constructed to 305' in
                 length (230' of storage plus a 75' bay taper).

              4. Install a 3 color, two-phase traffic signal at the proposed middle site drive
                 intersection with Route 417.

           5. The proposed west site drive on Route 417 should be constructed with
              two lanes exiting and one lane entering to accommodate the appropriate
              design vehicle, and be stop sign controlled.

           6. The proposed middle site drive on Route 417 should be constructed with
              two lanes exiting (a left turn lane and one shared through/right turn lane)
              and one lane entering to accommodate the appropriate design vehicle.

           7. The proposed east site drive on Route 417 should be constructed with
              one lane exiting and one lane entering to accommodate appropriate
              design vehicle, and be stop sign controlled.

           8. All recommended roadway and intersection improvements along Route
              417 are subject to review and approval by the New York State
              Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).

    Level of Service:
Criteria and Definitions
        Level of Service Criteria
           Highway Capacity Manual 2000
SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Level of Service is a qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic
stream, based on service measures such as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver,
traffic interruptions, comfort, and convenience. Level of Service for signalized
intersections is defined in terms of delay specifically, average total delay per vehicle for a
15 minute analysis period. The ranges are as follows:


                                  Level     Control Delay
                                   of        per vehicle
                                 Service      (seconds)
                                    A            < 10
                                    B           10 ­ 20
                                    C           20 ­ 35
                                    D           35 ­ 55
                                    E           55 ­ 80
                                    F            >80



UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Level of Service for unsignalized intersections is also defined in terms of delay.
However, the delay criteria are different from a signalized intersection. The primary
reason for this is driver expectation that a signalized intersection is designed to carry
higher volumes than an unsignalized intersection. The total delay threshold for any given
Level of Service is less for an unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection.
The ranges are as follows:

                                  Level     Control Delay
                                   of        per vehicle
                                 Service      (seconds)
                                    A            < 10
                                    B           10 ­ 15
                                    C           15 ­ 25
                                    D           25 ­ 35
                                    E           35 - 50
                                    F            >50

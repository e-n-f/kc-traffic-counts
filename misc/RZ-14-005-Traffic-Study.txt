INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the traffic impact that will result from the proposed
mixed-use development located in the southwest corner of the intersection at SR 141 (Medlock
Bridge Road) @ Old Alabama Road in Johns Creek, Georgia. The proposed development will
consist of:
   x 28,000 s.f. Supermarket
   x 4,000 s.f. Drive-in Bank
   x 14,000 s.f. High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant
   x 20,000 s.f. Shopping Center
   x 44 units Residential Condominium/Townhouse
   x 182 apartment units
The location of the proposed development and the surrounding roadway network is shown in
Figure 1.

The evaluation includes a proposed GDOT widening project (PI #752660) that will be
constructed around the same time as the proposed development (2015). The GDOT project
consists of widening Old Alabama Road to add an additional (second) westbound lane between
Buice Road and SR 141. The widening project also includes modifications to the SR 141 @ Old
Alabama Road intersection that will result in dual left turn lanes on northbound SR 141 (turning
left onto Old Alabama).

The development is proposed to have one full access driveway along Old Alabama Road and two
right-in / right-out driveways along SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road). The site will also have
access to the traffic signal on SR 141 at Bobby Jones Drive via an interparcel connection. In this
study, the AM and PM peak hours have been analyzed. This study includes the evaluation of the
existing, base and future traffic operations at the intersections of
    x State Bridge Road @ SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road)
    x Medlock Crossing Parkway @ SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road)
    x Old Alabama Road @ SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road)
    x Bobby Jones Drive @ SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road)
    x Old Alabama Road @ Buice Road

The site driveways have also been evaluated for the future condition. Recommendations to
improve traffic operations have been identified, where appropriate.

STUDY METHODOLOGY
In this study, the methodology used for evaluating traffic operations at each of the subject
intersections is based on the criteria set forth in the Transportation Research Board's Highway
Capacity Manual, 2000 edition (HCM 2000). Synchro software, which utilizes the HCM 2000
methodology, was used for the analysis. The following is a description of the methodology
employed for the analysis of unsignalized and signalized intersections.

Unsignalized Intersections

For unsignalized intersections at which the side street or minor street is controlled by a stop sign,
the criteria for evaluating traffic operations are the level of service (LOS) for the turning
movements at the intersection and the level of service for the overall intersection. Level of
service is based on the average controlled delay incurred at the intersection. Controlled delay for
unsignalized intersections includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped
delay, and final acceleration delay. Several factors affect the controlled delay for unsignalized
intersections, such as the availability and distribution of gaps in the conflicting traffic stream,
critical gaps, and follow-up time for a vehicle in the queue.

Level of service is assigned a letter designation from A through F. Level of service A indicates
excellent operations with little delay to motorists, while level of service F exists when there are
insufficient gaps of acceptable size to allow vehicles on the side street to cross safely, resulting
in extremely long total delays and long queues. The level of service criteria for two-way stop-
controlled and all-way stop-controlled (unsignalized) intersections is given in Table 1.

Signalized Intersections

For signalized intersections, it is necessary to evaluate both capacity and level of service in order
to evaluate the overall operation of the intersection. The capacity analysis of an intersection is
performed by comparing the volume of traffic using the various lane groups at the intersection to
the capacity of those lane groups. This results in a volume/capacity (v/c) ratio for each lane
group. A v/c ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that the volume of traffic has exceeded the capacity
available, resulting in a temporary excess of demand. Although the capacity of the entire
intersection is not defined, a composite v/c ratio for the sum of the critical lane groups within the
intersection is computed. This composite v/c ratio is an indication of the overall intersection
sufficiency.

Level of service for a signalized intersection is defined in terms of average controlled delay per
vehicle, which is composed of initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and
final acceleration delay. The levels of service criteria for signalized intersections, based on
average controlled delay, are shown in Table 2. Level of service A indicates operations with very
low controlled delay, while level of service F describes operations with extremely high average
controlled delay. Level of service E is typically considered to be the limit of acceptable delay,
and level of service F is considered unacceptable by most drivers.

EXISTING TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
Existing peak hour traffic counts and intersection geometric data were collected at the study
intersections on Thursday, January 9, 2014. All turning movement counts were recorded during
the AM and PM peak hours between 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.,
respectively. The four consecutive 15-minute interval volumes that summed to produce the
highest volume at the intersections were then determined. These volumes make up the peak hour
traffic volumes for the intersections counted and are shown in Figure 2 for morning and evening
peak hours.

Existing traffic operations were analyzed at the study intersections in accordance with the HCM
methodology. The results of the analyses are shown in Table 3. The existing traffic control and
lane geometry for the intersections are shown in Figure 3.

Results are based on optimized timing with a known 180 second cycle length along SR 141.
Delays are seen along the SR 141 corridor at the State Bridge Road and Old Alabama Road
signals in each peak hour. Additionally, the Medlock Crossing Pkwy signal also sees delays in
the evening peak.

BASE 2015 TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
In order to evaluate Base 2015 traffic operations in this area, a projection was made of future
growth of traffic through the study network. The Base traffic volumes are made up of the
Existing traffic volumes added to expected growth in the area. The Georgia Department of
Transportation recorded average daily traffic volumes at several locations in the vicinity of the
site. Reviewing the growth over the last several years revealed growth of approximately 1.5% in
the area. This growth factor was applied to the Existing traffic volumes on the roadways to
estimate the Base 2015 (No Build) condition with the proposed GDOT widening plans
completed, but without any added site traffic. The Base (no build) traffic volumes for 2015 are
shown in Figure 4.

Traffic operation analysis was evaluated for the Base 2015 traffic (with the proposed lane
geometry from the widening project) prior to the addition of traffic from the proposed
development. The results of the analysis are shown in Table 4. The Base traffic control and lane
geometry for the intersections is shown in Figure 5.

With the proposed GDOT widening of Old Alabama Road and added left turn lane from SR 141,
improvements will be seen at the intersection and (to some extent) along the SR 141 corridor,
with regular growth in traffic through the study network.

PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
The proposed residential development will consist of:
    x 28,000 s.f. Supermarket
    x 4,000 s.f. Drive-in Bank
    x 14,000 s.f. High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant
    x 20,000 s.f. Shopping Center
    x 44 units Residential Condominium/Townhouse
    x 182 apartment units
The proposed development will have one full access driveway along Old Alabama Road and two
right-in / right-out driveways along SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road). The site will also have
access via interparcel connection to a traffic signal at the SR 141 @ Bobby Jones Drive
intersection. A site plan is shown in Figure 6.

Trip Generation
Trip generation estimates for the project were based on the rates and equations published in the
8th edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation report. This
reference contains traffic volume count data collected at similar facilities nationwide. The trip
generation was based on the following ITE Land Use:
    x 850 ­ Supermarket
    x 912 ­ Drive-in Bank
    x 820 ­ Shopping Center
    x 932 ­ High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant
    x 220 ­ Apartment
    x 230 ­ Residential Condominium/Townhouse

The calculated trip generation for the site is shown in Table 5.

Trip Distribution

The trip distribution describes how traffic arrives and departs from the site. An overall trip
distribution was developed for the site based on a review of the existing travel patterns in the
area and the locations of major roadways and highways that will serve the development. This
distribution is shown in Figure 7. The site-generated traffic volumes, shown in Table 5, were
assigned to the study area intersections based on this distribution. The AM and PM peak hour
traffic generated by the site is shown in Figure 8.




                                                                                A&R Engineering Inc.

FUTURE 2015 TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
In order to evaluate future traffic operations in this area, the site generated traffic volumes
(shown in Figure 8) were added to the Base 2015 traffic volumes (shown in Figure 4) to
calculate the future traffic volumes. Pass-by trips for the proposed site were also assigned
(calculations provided in the Volumes Worksheets in the Appendix). The resulting traffic
volumes, shown in Figure 9, were used to analyze future traffic operations at all the study
intersections. In this condition, the resulting total future peak hour volumes were analyzed with
the following changes from the existing conditions:
    x Improvements along Old Alabama Road from the GDOT widening project (discussed in
        the Base 2015 Traffic Operations section of the report)
    x A signal is proposed at the site driveway on Old Alabama Road, which is planned to be
        constructed as a Continuous Green T-Intersection ("Florida T") that will provide a
        continuous green phase for the westbound approach (similar to the Buice Road signal
        configuration)
The results of the future traffic operation analysis are shown in Table 6.

Moderate increases in delays are anticipated at the Medlock Bridge Rd @ Old Alabama Road
intersection as a result of the added traffic from the proposed site, which brings operations back
to near the same levels-of-service existing conditions along Old Alabama Road, with minor
increases at other study intersections along SR 141. There are no major delays anticipated at the
site driveway locations. Queues for the Old Alabama Road @ SR 141 intersection and added site
driveways are shown below.

The queuing analysis shows that the eastbound approach on Old Alabama Road towards the
signal at SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road) will occasionally extend beyond the site driveway,
primarily for those turning right (south) onto SR 141. MUTCD sign R10-7 (Do Not Block
Intersection) should be placed on this approach. Queuing for all other entering and existing
movements at site driveway locations are shown to be within the provided storage lengths. The
recommended configurations and storages at the site driveway locations are provided in the
Conclusions and Recommendations section of this report.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Traffic impacts were evaluated due to the proposed Overlook at Johns Creek mixed-use
development in the southwest corner of the intersection at SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road) @
Old Alabama Road in Johns Creek, Georgia. Existing, Base (no build) and Future (build) traffic
operations were evaluated at the intersections of:
   x SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road) @ State Bridge Road
   x SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road) @ Medlock Crossing Parkway
   x SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road) @ Old Alabama Road
   x SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road) @ Bobby Jones Drive / Proposed Site Access
   x Old Alabama Road @ Buice Road
The proposed site driveways have also been evaluated for the future condition:
   x Proposed Signalized Driveway @ Old Alabama Road
   x Proposed Right-In / Right-Out Driveway @ SR 141
   x Proposed Right-In / Right-Out Bank Driveway @ SR 141

The evaluation includes improvements to Old Alabama Road from a future GDOT widening
project (PI #752660) that will be constructed around the same time as the proposed development
(2015). The GDOT project consists of widening Old Alabama Road to add an additional
(second) westbound lane between Buice Road and SR 141. The GDOT project also includes
modifications at the SR 141 / Old Alabama Road that will result in dual left turn lanes on
northbound SR 141 (turning left onto Old Alabama).

The results of the analysis are described below:

When accounting for the GDOT improvements on Old Alabama Road, intersections along Old
Alabama Road (including at SR 141) will operate at similar levels-of-service as the existing
(2014) conditions with minor increases at other study intersections along SR 141.

The queuing analysis shows that the eastbound approach on Old Alabama Road towards the
signal at SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road) will occasionally extend beyond the site driveway,
primarily for those turning right (south) onto SR 141. MUTCD sign R10-7 (Do Not Block
Intersection) should be placed on this approach. Queuing for all other entering and existing
movements at site driveway locations are shown to be within the provided storage lengths. The
following configurations and storages are recommended at the site driveway locations:




                                                                     A&R Engineering Inc.

Site Drwy on Old Alabama Road:
The site driveway has been analyzed as a signalized intersection with the configuration of a
Continuous Green T-Intersection (also known as "Florida T"). The intersection would provide a
continuous green signal for westbound traffic, with site traffic being required to merge upon
turning left out from the site driveway. A concept of this configuration is shown below.




   x   GDOT and Johns Creek criteria requires a deceleration lane on Old Alabama Road at the
       site driveway due to the daily right-turn volume and ADT on Old Alabama Road. In
       discussions with Johns Creek and GDOT, it was desirable to maximize spacing between
       the driveway and SR 141 by shifting the driveway to the west end of the property.
       Therefore, a deceleration lane will not be feasible without additional right-of-way from
       the adjacent property owner.
   x   A left turn lane should be provided in the space between the site driveway and the left
       turn lane for the Old Alabama Road @ SR 141 intersection. This lane is estimated to
       provide 221' of storage.
   x   The site driveway approach to the intersection should have a separate lane for left and
       right turns, with 175' of left turn storage and 125' of right turn storage for exiting traffic.

                    RIRO Driveway on SR 141
                      x GDOT criteria requires a deceleration lane on SR 141 at the site
                        driveway due to the daily right-turn volume and ADT on SR 141.
                        The standard length is 175' of storage with a 100' taper.

                    RIRO Bank Driveway on SR 141
                      x GDOT criteria requires a deceleration lane on SR 141 at the site
                        driveway due to the daily right-turn volume and ADT on SR 141.
                        The standard length is 175' of storage with a 100' taper.

                     SR 141 @ Bobby Jones Drive / Site Access
                     There are anticipated to be minimal right-turns at this access point;
                     however, left turns are likely as this is the only left-in / left-out access point
                     from SR 141 without diverting to Old Alabama Road. Left and right turn
                     lanes are currently in-place on SR 141 at the traffic signal. Left turn phases
                     are also provided on SR 141 in both directions. No further improvements
                     are needed to accommodate the additional site traffic at this intersection.

                                                                           A&R Engineering Inc.

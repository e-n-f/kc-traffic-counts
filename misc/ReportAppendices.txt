NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study



Existing Conditions Overview
The NC-54 corridor is major arterial providing access to southwest Durham County and the
Town of Chapel Hill. It is characterized by heavy congestion, especially during the peak hours,
mainly because no other major east-west routes exist within the surrounding area and it draws
commuting demand from a wide market area seeking access to the University of North Carolina
and its medical center, as well as office, hotel and retail destinations located along NC 54
between I-40 and Fordham Road.

There are multiple competing travel needs within the corridor. Nearby residents use the corridor
for local trips and face congestion throughout much of the day. Residents from Durham County,
Chatham County and areas served by I-40 commute to Chapel Hill, where the university and
medical center are major regional employment centers. Transit service is heavily used within the
corridor, and the Friday Center park-and-ride lot is a popular facility for commuters traveling to
Chapel Hill. Pedestrians and bicyclists use the corridor for both recreational and limited
transportation purposes, but the high-speed nature of the roadway, separated land use and limited
facilities conspire to curtail bicycle and pedestrian activity. In addition, a passenger rail system
has long been discussed and planned to serve this corridor as part of a larger regional system.
Local and express buses serve the corridor, further exacerbating the issue of competing scales of
travel. Local residents want more bus stops within the corridor for better accessibility to
destination along the corridor; commuters want to minimize the number of stops to travel
through the corridor quickly. It is the lack of alternate routes, both local and regional, that
concentrates congestion on this corridor, and ultimately inhibits the mobility of all trips along the
corridor.

The land use and urban form pattern generally solely accommodates the automobile as a means
of transportation, as evidenced by low densities and large parking lots; however, this is not the
case through the entire corridor. The Meadowmont development and portions of the corridor in
Chapel Hill have features that provide for safe, if isolated pedestrian accessibility. Pedestrian
mobility is especially challenging on the east side of the corridor in Durham County, although
pedestrian and bicyclist safety is an issue throughout the corridor.

The area around the NC-54 corridor has poor connectivity with very little distributed networks.
Because of the heavy traffic volume within the area, any connected street that provides an
alternate route would likely face increasing levels of high-speed cut through traffic. Pedestrians
and bicyclists also experience poor connectivity and lack comfortable places to walk or ride
along the corridor. Transit connectivity is also challenging, as the Durham and Chapel Hill
transit systems' services end at the city/town limits, creating gaps in service that do not match
the needs of many existing and potential riders in the corridor. Triangle Transit does provide an
overlap to connect these two systems, but the service has limitations.

The park-and-ride at the Friday Center has been a huge success in the corridor, serving the UNC
main campus and UNC medical complex. Many people use the transit system to avoid driving
and parking in downtown Chapel Hill or on the UNC campus; existing transit ridership along the
NC 54 corridor exceeds 5,000 passengers per day and includes standing loads during the peak
commuting periods. People living along the corridor without good transit service appear to drive

the short distance to the Friday Center to use transit to access the UNC campus, thus limiting the
parking spaces available to longer distance commuters. While this strategy has been successful at
displacing many commuter trips, the corridor remains one of the most congested corridors in the
region, in part because even those who use transit must travel through the key choke point at I-40
and Farrington Road to reach the park-and-ride lot.

There are several areas of opportunity for the study area that could help the corridor to serve
these multiple travel needs more effectively. Many people rely on the transit systems and the
park-and-ride lots to access UNC main campus, UNC medical complex, the Town of Chapel Hill
and other destinations along the corridor. Continuing to invest and provide services for transit
and park-and-ride lots in the vicinity of I-40 could help mitigate automobile travel demand in the
corridor. Providing better transportation network connectivity and safe access can also help to
provide alternate routes for local trips, and encourage pedestrian and bicycle activity. Providing
pedestrian infrastructure, including pavement markings and design features, at intersections will
help to make the corridor safer for pedestrians and transit riders.

In planning for the planned future rail system, encouraging transit-oriented development near the
planned transit stations will help to shorten trip lengths in the near future, and will provide the
density and diversity of land uses to help attract federal funding while making the rail link more
viable to capture trips when it is implemented. Planning transit-oriented development in nodes
or station areas along the corridor can also support local transit, bicycling and walking trips in
the near-term.

These challenges and opportunities will be further explored through a scenario planning process
that envisions possible futures for the NC 54/I-40 corridor sub-area as a basis for establishing a
transportation-land use blueprint to guide future investments and policies. This corridor profile
establishes baseline conditions as a starting point for creating and evaluating the corridor
scenarios.

NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study



Background
Introduction
The City of Durham and the Town of Chapel Hill are neighboring communities in the Central
Piedmont area of North Carolina. The University of North Carolina resides within the Town of
Chapel Hill, and is a major employment center and an area attraction for educational, social and
recreational activities. Two major north-south routes exist between the Town of Chapel Hill and
Durham County: US Route 15/501 and Interstate 40. NC Route 54 provides a critical link
between Durham and Chapel Hill, as well as to major activity centers in southwest Durham
County, the Research Triangle Park, Carrboro and beyond. Today it is characterized as a heavily
congested arterial; the NC-54 and I-40 interchange has consistently ranked as the top congested
location in the Triangle region.

The area is facing development pressure because of the demand for medical, commercial and
residential land uses near complementary destinations like UNC and its growing medical
complex. Environmental and development constraints limit east-west travel options, forcing a
large amount of regional and local traffic to use NC 54. Inadequate capacity to meet this demand,
as well as barriers and gaps for non-auto travel alternatives, conspire to create a serious
congestion problem that threatens the economic vitality and community livability of one of the
region's most economically important corridors. There is intense regional and multi-
jurisdictional interest in the NC-54 corridor from daily commuters, the City of Durham, the
Town of Chapel Hill, UNC, local businesses and residents, and the development community.

Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study is to prepare a Transportation ­ Land Use Master Plan (aka
"Blueprint") for the NC-54 and I-40 study area. The study area boundaries generally encompass
NC-54 from US 15/501 in Chapel Hill to just east of I-40, and I-40 from the Farrington Road
overpass to the NC-54 interchange, including adjacent neighborhoods and feeder and parallel
roadway networks located north and south of this arterial corridor.

Through a comprehensive public involvement process and technical analyses, up to three
feasible land use-transportation scenarios for the future will be indentified and evaluated to
determine the best framework for well-planned growth and improved mobility within the study
area. Each scenario will entail a distinct combination of land use and transportation strategies to
address corridor issues and needs. The outcome of the study entails selection of a preferred
scenario and detailed master plan blueprint to guide orderly growth and development that
sustains economic vitality, increases personal mobility, protects environmental resources and
enhances community livability into the future.

Recommendations for short-term and long range integrated land-use and multimodal
transportation strategies will be developed, including recommendations for transportation
improvements and land-use policies.

This technical memorandum summarizes the data and information compiled during the first two
tasks of the study (Project Initiation and Corridor/Sub-Area Profile). The completion of these
tasks required coordination with the Steering Committee, collection of traffic data, compiling an
inventory of existing infrastructure, reviewing previous planning documents and studies, traffic
analysis and modeling, assembling environmental data, and conducting a land development
capacity analysis. This information and analyses are essential preparation for the next phases of
the project.

History of the Communities
The area now incorporated as the City of Durham was home to the Eno and Occaneechi tribes
before the Europeans arrived in the early 1700s. The Native Americans traced transportation
routes through the area, including the Great Indian Trading Path. Early European settlers worked
the land and built gristmills. After the Revolutionary War, large plantations were established,
and in 1849, Dr. Barlett Durham provided land for a railroad station, leading to the success of the
tobacco industry and others. Known for its medical education institutions, the City of Durham
boasts Duke University and North Carolina Central University as its most prized assets.

The Town of Chapel Hill was created to serve the University of North Carolina, founded in
1793. The UNC Board of Trustees named a committee to lay out the town in 1798, and it
consisted of 30 parcel and six streets. Until the 1940s the town remained a small relatively rural
village. In 1952, the UNC Hospital opened (then called the North Carolina Memorial Hospital),
and the partnership between UNC Hospitals and the School of Medicine began. Especially in the
last 35 years, the University has continued to grow, and the UNC Medical Center has become the
state's leading public medical facility. Because of the recent growth and change in the
University, it has transformed into a thriving cosmopolitan university city. The UNC Medical
Center is a statewide research and treatment center that is driving the growth in the study area
more than any other single entity.

Regional Context
As shown in Figure 1, the NC-54 and I-40 corridors are significant components of the regional
and local transportation network within the Triangle region. These two corridors serve the
Chapel Hill and Durham communities, linking to major travel routes (US 15/501, US 70, and I-
85) and the following nearby centers: Raleigh-Durham International Airport (12 miles east),
Cary (20 miles southeast), Raleigh (30 miles southeast), Wake Forest (35 miles east), Apex (20
miles southeast), and Greensboro (50 miles west). While the I-40 corridor provides primarily
high-speed freeway travel for regional and commuting trips, the NC-54 corridor serves many
roles. It is a regional arterial for commuters, a gateway to the areas' cultural historical and
recreational attractions, and a primary commercial/retail corridor. The NC 54 corridor also
experiences demand from through traffic from southern Orange County and northern Chatham
County to destinations in Durham and Wake Counties, including the Research Triangle Park.

Many commuters from mostly rural Chatham County and other areas in the Triangle use I-40
and NC-54 to access employment opportunities. Partly because of the constraints on
development in Chapel Hill, growth is occurring throughout the region in previously rural or
agricultural areas, and many commuters must use NC-54 to access jobs.

NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study



What did the NC-54 corridor look like in the past, and how
has it grown?
Environmental Constraints
The natural features of the area were the first influential factors in the development of the
corridor. The rolling topography in the study area creates highly desirable views from residential
properties. The settlement in this area was initially very low density residential homes on larger
lots. In the 1970s through 1990s residential subdivisions were the predominant development
patterns.

Steep slopes present very minimal constraints in the study area as most are evident on large
parcels zoned for low density housing. Moderate slopes are attractive to development providing
broad views over the surrounding landscape and require minimal earthwork. Figure 2 shows the
slope intensities within the study area.

Floodplains and wetlands are two of the primary limitations to development in the study area, as
shown in Figure 3. At the same time they create a very attractive open space framework for
development in the corridor and could provide a foil for dense development of unconstrained
parcels. Most of the vacant constrained parcels are currently in public or quasi-public
ownership, and thus should not create hazardous conditions for future development. The open
space framework they create could become a major community asset.

The floodplain boundaries are protected areas within the study area, owned by the Army Corps
of Engineers. Jordan Lake, a drinking water reservoir for Cary and Chatham County is another
protected area to the south. Development pressures are present for the Jordan Lake area, where
Durham's Board of County Commissioners has recently voted to move the protective buffer
boundaries to make room for more development. Jordan Lake could soon become a drinking
water source for Durham County residents too.

NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study



Historical Development patterns
The corridor's main function has always been to provide a link from the Town of Chapel Hill
and the University of North Carolina from Durham County and points east. The direct
connection with I-40 encourages regional trips through the corridor, especially from the
southeast.

The corridor initially developed to serve the regional traffic with highway strip commercial
development and a few residential subdivisions. Many older homes still exist in the
neighborhoods around Finley Golf Course.

Within the past few decades, development has grown especially around either ends of the
corridor because of the interchanges with I-40 and US 15/501. Historically, this has been a
prime location for regional employment centers and for interstate exit service land uses, the
"drive-up" or "drive thru" developments. For example, the Quadrant and Carolina Point
employment centers exist yards away from the I-40 interchange, and within a one-minute drive
of the Bank of America, Hardee's fast food restaurant, Shell gas station, and Holiday Inn
Express.

Development pressures have continued and more residential subdivisions have started to "fill in"
in the middle of the corridor. Most of these residential communities are the sprawling
unconnected subdivisions common in suburban and exurban areas built before the 1990s, built
on the south side of the NC-54 corridor.

More recently, the Meadowmont development, a traditional neighborhood development, is an
exception in the corridor, and may form the basis of a new trend. This development provides
housing units for mixed incomes, has a walkable town center with retail and recreation, provides
connectivity within the development and provides a safe paved path for bicyclists and
pedestrians that connects to the existing sidewalk network. However, Meadowmont is still
largely a "drive-to" activity center because of the barrier NC-54 represents in linking the bicycle
and pedestrian network to other residential areas. The unsubmitted Leigh Village master plan
could be a smaller, more compact version of the Meadowmont development. The 54 East
project within the corridor is another example of the shifting trend in development patterns and is
an example of transit-oriented development. This project is approved and nearing completion
under construction in Chapel Hill. A vision plan with clear development guidelines for the
corridor would further support this type of development.

Traffic Patterns1
The historical patterns of development have continued to encourage personal vehicle use on NC-
54. The traffic demand has also intensified because no other east-west arterial exists within close
proximity to distribute trips.

NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study


Over the past 10 years, the corridor has seen an increase in traffic of about 30 percent averaging
a growth rate of about three percent per year. In 1997, the annual daily traffic (ADT) on NC-54
within the study area averaged about 35,000 vehicles per day. As of 2007, NC-54 services an
average of 45,000 vehicles per day. The segments of I-40 within the study area have also seen a
slightly higher rate of growth. In 1997 the I-40 ADT averaged 58,300 vehicles per day west of
the NC-54 interchange. As of 2007 it was 83,000 vehicles per day, averaging about 40 percent
growth in one decade. East of the NC 54 interchange, traffic on I-40 has grown from 82,400 to
108,000 in the past decade, averaging 30 percent growth in 10 years. The volume increase on I-
40 was essentially enabled by a one-lane widening in each direction.

The areas with the greatest concentrations of recent growth have been those around Farrington
Road and Barbee Chapel Road. These two roads have nearly doubled their daily traffic within
the past decade (90-100% growth from 1997 to 2007). Whereas Chapel Hill had higher traffic
volumes than Durham in the past, Durham now sees approximately the same volumes as Chapel
Hill due to the increased growth around Farrington Road and Barbee Chapel Road.

NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study



How does the corridor function today?
Existing Traffic Conditions
To understand the existing traffic conditions, current data were collected from several sources.
Turning movement counts (TMCs) were collected and compiled at 10 intersections along the
NC-54 corridor.2 Annual daily traffic (ADT) counts were also collected at 16 locations within
the study area.3 See Figure 4 for a map of the data collection effort. Seasonal adjustment was
not necessary for the ADT counts, as would be necessary for the beach and mountain areas to
account for the high variation in traffic related to the tourist seasons.

The NC-54 corridor sees extremely heavy traffic and long queues during the morning and
evening commute hours. Generally, the morning peak hour for the corridor is 7:30-8:30 AM,
and the evening peak hour is 5:00-6:00 PM. The I-40 ramps and Farington Road intersections
have a slightly later morning peak hour (7:45-8:45 AM for Farrington Road; 8:00-9:00 AM for I-
40 ramps). The Leigh Farm Road/Quadrangle Drive intersection has a slightly earlier PM peak
hour (4:15-5:15 PM), which may be due to the work hours of the large employment complex.

Queues for eastbound and westbound through traffic at intersection cans stretch over 1000 feet
back from the intersection (over 25 cars or 0.2 miles). A field review revealed that the eastbound
traffic in the PM peak hour at Farrington Road can stretch almost a half-mile back from the
intersection. The modeled queue lengths of each intersection approach can be found in the
Synchro printouts compiled in the Traffic Technical Appendix. Observations at this intersection
have validated the model's outputs.

It is this heavy east-west traffic that prompts traffic signals to have long cycle lengths (150-200
seconds). A large proportion of the cycle time is allocated to the east and west through
movements. Although the side-street traffic and left-turns must wait a long time, the east/west
through traffic receives a low (good) level of service (LOS). As shown in Table 1, most of the
signalized intersections along the corridor are operating at overall LOS D or better. While the
average side-street vehicle may wait minutes at the intersection, the main through movements on
NC-54 generally experience an average wait of 20 seconds or less.

  Turning movement counts for the intersections within the Town of Chapel Hill were conducted in September 2009
as part of the UNC data collection effort. Counts at the intersection of NC 54 with Farrington Road and the I-40
ramps were provided by the City of Durham. The intersection of NC 54 and Huntingridge Road was counted in
October 2009 by Data Collection Group.

  Average annual daily traffic counts on I-40 were taken from NCDOT's 2008 AADT Traffic maps. AADTs for all
other locations were collected in September 2009 by Data Collection Group.

*Synchro analysis indicates Huntingridge operates at LOS C in the AM peak, as it generally reflects lower delays in super-saturated conditions as compared to
HCM.


Level of service is a general term that describes the overall operating conditions of an
intersection as a measure of travel time. It is directly based on the amount of time vehicles are
delayed at an intersection. Level of service "A" is the best condition (where the average vehicle
waits 10 seconds or less at an intersection), and "F" is the worst (where the average vehicle waits
80 seconds or more at a signalized intersection, or 50 seconds or more at an unsignalized
intersection). Generally, transportation engineers strive for LOS D or better in suburban
environments. This standard changes as environments become more urban and transportation
options increase. Level of service is one of several measures that should be considered in this
increasingly complex and evolving corridor.

Farrington Road and the I-40 ramps operate at overall LOS E or F. These intersections are by far
the most congested in the study area. The intersections are also extremely close to each other;
Farrington Road and the I-40 eastbound ramps are only about 300 feet apart. Seven lanes of
traffic, heavy delays for all approaches and long queues make these intersections difficult for
commuters during rush hours. Analysis indicates that most of the movements at these
intersections operate at LOS F, experiencing delays of over two minutes, up to six minutes of
delay in the case of vehicles waiting at the northbound approach of Farrington to make a right
turn in the PM peak hour. Arguably the most problematic traffic movement in the corridor is
turning left at Farrington Road immediately after exiting the I-40 eastbound off ramp. These
vehicles have less than 300 feet to cross over three lanes in extremely congested situations.

The volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) is another standard measure of the operating conditions at an
intersection. This ratio measures the amount of traffic at an intersection against the "available
capacity" or the maximum total number of vehicles that the intersection could handle. Values
above 1.0 indicate that the intersection is operating at or above capacity, that there is no more
"room" for additional demand on the intersection. The intersections at Farrington Road and the
I-40 Eastbound ramps have V/C ratios well above 1.0 in both AM and PM peak periods. This
leads to a condition of "peak spreading," in which the excessive demand causes travelers to alter
their arrival and departure times to reduce delay. With excessive demand, this merely expands

the peak beyond traditional rush hours, making congestion a lingering experience on typical
weekdays.

Figures 5 and 6 show typical conditions around the Farrington Road intersection and I-40
interchange in the PM peak hour. These images are screenshots of the SimTraffic simulation
model.

Several segments of the study area were analyzed using the Florida Department of
Transportation's (FDOT) generalized level of service tables, which provide a solid planning
level indication of the operation of roadways based upon several factors like number of lanes,
medians, left turn lanes, frequency of signals and roadway classification among other factors.
The thresholds for the different levels of service vary depending on the classifications and
characteristics of the roadway. These tables, which are based on the Highway Capacity Manual,
are provided in the Traffic Technical Appendix. The FDOT generalized tables establish basic
planning level estimates for traffic conditions. In the future analysis, the NCLOS software will
be utilized to determine more specific levels of service, volume-to-capacity ratios, and necessary
road improvements for the projected future volumes.

The NC-54 corridor generally functions at LOS F, because of the high volumes on the corridor
and the frequency of traffic signals in the Orange County portion and near the I-40 interchange,
with a few exceptions. The segment near the Meadowmont development operates at LOS E for
several reasons. The daily volume is about 6,000 vehicles less than the area around the US
15/501 interchange. This segment of the road has six travel lanes, whereas the portions in
Durham County have only four travel lanes. The area east of Quadrangle Drive and the I-40
interchange operates at LOS D because the volume of traffic is significantly reduced by the I-40
interchange. Generally, the other road segments within the study area operate at an acceptable
level of service, with the exception of US 15/501.

The existing conditions traffic analyses are graphically summarized in Figure 7.

NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study



Transit Use and Service
Because of the increasing congestion, severely constrained parking on the UNC campus and
growing demand on the NC-54 corridor, transit use has grown as a viable means of
transportation, especially for commuters from Durham to the Town of Chapel Hill and the
University of North Carolina. Chapel Hill Transit and Triangle Transit offer multiple local and
express bus routes through the corridor.

Triangle Transit operates three routes along the corridor, carrying about 900 passengers daily.4
Route 550/500 is an express service connecting downtown Chapel Hill to downtown Raleigh.
This route does not stop along the corridor, but does travel through the corridor every 30
minutes. Route 412/413 and Route 402/403 provide service to stops along the corridor. Both
routes provide service every 30 minutes. Their schedules are staggered roughly 12 minutes so as
to prevent simultaneous arrival of both routes. As a result, a Triangle Transit bus arrives roughly
every 15 minutes. These two routes also serve the same general areas, connecting downtown
Chapel Hill, Durham and the Triangle Transit Regional Transit Center at Slater Road in
Durham's Imperial Center, adjacent to the Research Triangle Park. A majority of Triangle
Transit service focuses on regional trips connecting Durham, Raleigh and UNC, providing a link
between the local transit service providers operating in the Triangle region.

Chapel Hill Transit operates five routes along the corridor (Routes HU, G, S, V, and FCX).
These services focus on providing local connections between destinations along the corridor to
downtown Chapel Hill, where transit users can connect with other parts of Chapel Hill. Route G
only serves the northwest portion of the study area, mainly the Glen Lennox residential area and
Glen Lennox Shopping Center. This route provides service every 35 minutes in both directions
during peak hours. Route S and V provide service to various stops connecting adjacent
commercial and residential uses. During peak hours, Route S provides service every 10 to 15
minutes and Route V provides service every 30 minutes. Routes HU and FCX are express
services, with stops made at the Friday Center Park-n-Ride lot and downtown. Both routes
provide service every 10 minutes during the peak hours. Combined, these five routes serve about
5,000 passengers who board or alight at a stop within the corridor every day.5 These figures
represent the number of passenger-trips daily; a commuter using transit to and from the Town of
Chapel Hill would account for two trips.

Although the surrounding area is served by three different transit agencies, gaps in transit service
along the corridor exist and inhibit potential ridership. Most notably, the eastern end of the NC-
54 corridor in Durham has no service. Chapel Hill Transit service ends at Barbee Chapel Road
and the Friday Center park-and-ride lot; Triangle Transit only travels through the corridor; it
does not stop within the corridor; and the Durham Area Transit Authority service ends east of I-
40 at Route 751. Residents in the eastern portion of the corridor must drive to the Friday Center
park-and-ride lot to access transit to the UNC campus or downtown Chapel Hill.

The success of the Friday Center park-and-ride lot is a testament to the demand for alternative
modes of transportation. From field observations, many commuters use the Friday Center park-
and-ride to commute in to the Town of Chapel Hill. In the PM peak, full bus loads of passengers
depart at the Friday Center; many eastbound buses on the corridor are full, and westbound buses
are empty. The park-and-ride lots are usually near capacity on any typical weekday.

Town of Chapel Hill. Figure 9 displays the existing transit service routes within the study area.

NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study



Pedestrian and Bicycle Use
From field observations, pedestrians and bicyclists rarely travel along NC-54, with the exception
of recreational use along the shared use path serving the Meadowmont development to the
western end of the corridor at Burning Tree Drive. The corridor lacks many crucial pedestrian
features, compromising the safety of nearby residents who want to walk or bike to local shopping
or other destinations along the corridor.

The Chapel Hill portion of the corridor has adequate pedestrian infrastructure (a wide multi-use
path safely set back from the high-speed traffic). It was observed that this path is used mostly
for exercise activities; it is not primarily used as a travel way for trips to or from a destination;
however, Meadowmont and other neighborhood residents may use the multi-use paths for trips to
work, school and nearby services. This multi-use path connects to the recently constructed
Meadowmont development and provides a safe underpass below NC-54.

The Durham portion of the corridor lacks pedestrian infrastructure. Leigh Farm Road is the only
intersection with crosswalks and pedestrian signals.

As the NC-54 corridor is a high-speed heavily-traveled congested arterial with four to seven
lanes of traffic, it is not conducive to pedestrian or bicycle use. The surrounding development is
geared towards automobiles: it is not dense enough to generate substantial numbers of
pedestrian trips within the corridor traveling between land uses. Typically, development patterns
where complementary origins and destinations are located within a ¼ mile encourage pedestrian
activity.

Table 3 summarizes the pedestrian infrastructure and generalizes the condition of pedestrian
safety.

There are no bicycle lanes or wide outside lanes to accommodate bicyclists within the corridor.
The paved shoulders on NC 54 are only approximately 2-feet wide, whereas an adequate bicycle
lane should be 4 to 5 feet in width. The narrow section through the wetland on the Durham side
of the corridor is particularly dangerous for bicyclists with narrow lanes, no shoulders, and steep
banks on either side. The many lanes and high-speed travel particularly discourage bicycling as
a safe means of travel through the corridor. The speed differential is a major challenge for on-
road cycling; even experienced cyclists are often uncomfortable riding in environments where
the average speed is 20 or more miles per hour greater than the cycling speed. The lack of lower
speed parallel or interconnecting streets reduces the viability of bicycling in the study area.
Ephesus Church Road, with limited room for cyclists but offering lower speeds and fewer lanes
of traffic, provides the only real continuous east-west option for bicyclists. Several bicycle
commuters will travel routes that are five miles or 20 minutes out of their way to avoid NC 54.
North-south links are similarly limited, meaning that potential cyclists likely opt to travel by car
or transit for their transportation purposes instead.

Figures 10 and 11 show the pedestrian and bicycle facilities within the study area.

Several potential bicycle routes exist within the corridor. In particular, the multi-use path for
pedestrians and bicyclists will be extended to the Town of Chapel Hill limits in the near term and
further east in the longer term.

NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study



Crash History6
Within the past three years, 271 crashes have occurred within this corridor. Most of these (82%)
have been within 600 feet of an intersection. About 60 percent were rear-end crashes, which are
likely effects of congestion at traffic signals. Only one crash was a fatality, which occurred at
the intersection of West Barbee Chapel Road in 2007.

Figure 12 displays the relative concentrations of crashes in the corridor within the past three
years. The NCDOT Traffic Engineering Accident Analysis System reports total crash rates of
194 and 166 crashes per 100 million vehicle miles in the Orange and Durham County portions,
respectively. As shown in Table 4, these rates are slightly lower than the 2005-2007 North
Carolina average crash rates for state routes with similar characteristics. The first two lines of
Table 4 show the crash rates within the NC 54 corridor; the bottom line is a basis for
comparison.

The Farrington Road intersection has the greatest number of crashes in the corridor, with 41
crashes within the past three years. The intersection of NC 54 with West Barbee Chapel Road
also has a disproportionately high number of crashes, with 30 in the past three years. Residents
have noted that the intersection at Hamilton Road is also dangerous because of sight distance and
driveways close to the intersection.

NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study



What can we expect in the future?
Previous Studies
From a review of relevant planning documents, it is clear that the City of Durham, the Town of
Chapel Hill, and the Durham ­ Chapel Hill ­ Carrboro MPO acknowledge that improvements
must be made to the NC-54 corridor. Congestion within the area is a major problem.

The DCHC MPO Long Range Transportation Plan for 2035 lists several specific roadway
improvement projects within the study area including:

       ·   Widening NC-54 from 4 to 6 lanes from I-40 to Barbee Chapel Road (2025)

       ·   Constructing SW Durham Drive from Meadowmont Drive to I-40 (2025)

       ·   Implementing I-40 HOV lanes from US 15/501 to the Wake County line (2035)

These major road improvements may continue to encourage auto traffic as it will provide
additional roadway capacity for the anticipated population and job growth within the corridor
and surrounding area.

In addition to the road improvements, there is a growing focus on transit and alternative
transportation modes in many of the reviewed planning documents and studies. The
community's need and desire for a light rail system was identified in 1995 with the Triangle
Fixed Guideway Study (1995), which examined several alternatives for a transit system. This
study refined a composite alternative and developed recommendations for a Regional Transit
Plan. The US 15-501 Major Investment Study (1998-2001) ultimately resulted in the selection of
a preliminary alignment for the fixed guideway. The DCHC MPO later modified the alignment,
and all parties agree this rail system is necessary for the area. The MPO's Long Range
Transportation Plan envisions completion of the rail system by 2025, subject to voter approval of
a future funding source and federal funding commitments.

Recently, the Chapel Hill Transit Master Plan (2009) identified NC-54 between I-40 and
Fordham Boulevard (US 15/501) as one of six main corridors for use by commuters to access the
Chapel Hill-Carrboro community, and shows the proposed light rail guideway and Friday Center
park-and-ride lot as instrumental in intercepting travelers entering Chapel Hill with enhanced bus
service. The plan also generally recommends other transit-supportive concepts, such as
improved local bus service for connectivity, connections to regional transit, transit-supportive
development along the six "gateway" corridors, transit supportive land use policies, and parking
policies.

Focus on alternative transportation investments throughout the area is evident in several other
studies. The I-40 HOV Study (2000-2002) identified HOV lanes, rail and regional bus
improvements and travel demand management (TDM) strategies to improve the vehicle-carrying
capacity of I-40 in the Triangle region. The Airport Rail Link Study (2003) reaffirmed the need
for a rail link between Triangle Transit Authority's rail system and the Raleigh-Durham Airport


12/16/2009                                                                              27

(RDU). The DCHC MPO LRTP (2009) identifies a focus on transit station area development, as
well as access management, complete streets and context-sensitive design. It also recommends
enhanced bus service in Durham and Chapel Hill and regional bicycle facilities in the NC-54
study area.

The construction of collector routes is another common theme in several of the area's planning
documents. The DCHC Urban Thoroughfare Plan (1991) proposed a minor highway extending
from Barbee Chapel Road north to the Farrington Road bridge over I-40, identifying an early
need for a more connected roadway network in that area. The Collector Street Plan (2006)
continued to reinforce the community vision for a collector street system, and although the
proposed alignment was controversial, created a collector street map including Southwest
Durham Drive. After revisions to the maps, the approved collector street network was adopted
in 2007. The DCHC MPO LRTP (2009) lists the construction of SW Durham Drive on its
priority Road Projects List.

A review of several impact studies for developments within and near the corridor reveals that
development pressure still exists for the corridor, despite the growing congestion. While the
recent economic downturn may have slowed some development projects, it is likely that in the
rebound, development along the corridor and surrounding area will continue. While this list may
be incomplete, the following development projects have been proposed along the corridor:

       ·   751 Development (2009)­ Three development projects are located within the
           corridor's vicinity, near Barbee Chapel Road. These consist of approximately 200
           total new residential units.

       ·   Leigh Village Traffic Impact Study (2008) ­ This large mixed-use development would
           be located in the northwest quadrant of the I-40 interchange, consisting of
           approximately 2,000 residential units, a 76,000 s.f. hotel, 470,000 s.f. of general
           office space, 50,000 s.f. of medical office space, 200,000 s.f. of general commercial
           space, and a 52,000 s.f. grocery store. This study states that the Leigh Village site has
           been designated as a high density transit hub and includes a dedicated public transit
           corridor. The building of Leigh Village could stimulate a significant amount of
           additional development in the immediate area, especially if the development
           establishes access to NC 54.

       ·   Woodmont Traffic Impact Study (2007) ­ The first phase of this development includes
           90,000 s.f. of office space and 60 residential units. The development would be
           located south of NC-54 between Barbee Chapel Road and Little John Road.

       ·   Gateway Bank Traffic Impact Study (2007) ­ At the intersection of NC-54 and Barbee
           Chapel Road, the construction of a 13,000 s.f. banking facility was proposed.

Existing and Future Land Uses
Predominant Existing Land Uses

The existing land uses in the corridor are mostly typical of a suburban environment. On the west
end of the corridor near the US 15/501 interchange, strip malls front the road, and residential
subdivisions with single-family homes and townhouses are located behind on the north side. The
Finley Golf Course is located on the south side of the corridor behind the fronting businesses.

In the middle of the corridor, the Meadowmont development, an expansive mixed-use
development is located on the north side. This development contains a range of housing options,
and a "village center" with shops, restaurants and other uses for the residents. Churches and
schools are also present north of the corridor. The Friday Center park-and-ride lot is located
opposite the Meadowmont development on the south side, with a number of other large office
complexes. Just east of the Friday Center is a residential subdivision with a variety of medium
density housing.

The environmentally sensitive land on the Durham side of the corridor has prevented
development within the floodplain areas, although development pressure continues. There is a
large amount of environmentally sensitive land throughout the study area, 2,825 acres in total, or
49 percent of the land within the study area. The Army Corps of Engineers land accounts for
1,366 acres, approximately 50 percent of the total area of environmentally sensitive land.

Residential subdivisions are present to the east of the floodplains. Near the I-40 interchange,
highway commercial and service uses are present, including hotels, banks, fast food restaurants,
gas stations. Businesses front the corridor in strip development patterns. Large office complexes
exist on either side of the road just east of I-40. The proposed Leigh Village mixed use
development on the north side could provide housing, office space, commercial space, and a
hotel and grocery store if developed. Leigh Farm Park is located further to the north.

Predominant Land Ownership

In general, institutional uses account for a significant portion of the land uses within the corridor.
The University of North Carolina owns approximately 750 acres within the study area, or about
13 percent. Other institutional uses include the Town of Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill/Carrboro
School District and various other State and non-profit entities.

Patterns of Development

Almost half of the land in the corridor is in some form of public ownership. Much of this land is
constrained by floodplain or wetlands, but a considerable portion is under University of North
Carolina ownership. While publicly owned land is generally considered unlikely to be available
for development in this instance it must be studied in more detail as the University has often
proven to be an active developer. Figure 13 shows the areas of publicly owned land within the
study area.

NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study



Non-public existing land uses within the corridor are dominated by single-family residential
development which utilizes approximately 80 percent of the developed land. Non-residential
uses, including industrial, commercial and office, accounts for approximately 10 percent of the
land with the remainder in open space or recreational uses. Zoning on the remaining vacant land
follows a similar pattern, although there is capacity for a much larger proportion of employment
if the land develops at anticipated densities.

Development Pattern Prototypes for CorPlan Analysis

To analyze the effects of the land development patterns and uses, 12 prototypical development
patterns were developed for the land use modeling and scenario planning analysis. Under the
future scenarios, each parcel of vacant land and areas of potential can be designated as one of
these 12 development patterns. Each type has a distinct combination of household units per acre
and employees per acres, reflecting the land use characteristics of that development area, as
shown in Figures 14-17.

Within the study area, neither county currently has future land use designations that fully support
light rail transit. Each jurisdiction, however, has within its boundaries, zoning of sufficient
intensity to create vibrant station areas. Increasing the zoning intensities in future station areas
could promote transit supportive development to ensure the success of the rail service once
implemented. In particular, the transit supportive village residential and mixed-use development
patterns could help ensure the success of enhanced bus service and possible light rail service in
the future.

Each future scenario will entail allocating some or all of the prototypical development patterns to
the defined areas of potential change and vacant land, as explained in the following section. The
CorPlan model, in conjunction with the regional demand model can then predict new
transportation patterns and mode splits that evolve based on the different combinations and
proximities of development types. In the future scenarios, areas within the study area can change
development types to reflect the themes and predicted patterns of each scenario.

     Land Development Capacity Analysis
     Population and Employment

     The Triangle Travel Demand Model predicts the growth in population and jobs for the Triangle
     region by county. The model uses the latest planning assumptions as approved and adopted in
     documents such as the DCHC MPO 2035 Long Range Transportation Plan, the Durham
     Comprehensive Plan and the Orange County Comprehensive Plan. These planning assumptions
     are taken as input to the model in the form of land use forecasts (population, households,
     employment, etc) and transportation infrastructure (highway and transit). Different land uses
     exhibit different travel behaviors. The model forecasts traffic volumes on the roadways based on
     travel behavior of travelers in the region, including trip generation rates, origin destination
     patterns, modal split, and trip route choices. The model was calibrated and validated to represent
     these travel behaviors as accurately as possible.

     These predictions can be used to analyze whether the current zoning within the study area can
     accommodate the expected job and household growth. Forecasts are presented by county. The
     Town of Chapel Hill is included in the Orange County forecasts. Similarly, the City of Durham
     is included in the Durham County forecasts.

     Currently there are 1,862 and 2,420 households and 1,606 and 1,627 jobs with the Orange and
     Durham County portions of the study area, respectively.

     The Triangle Travel Demand Model predicts the Orange County portion of the study area will
     grow by 727 employees and 762 households from 2005 to 2035. Durham County will grow by
     8,698 employees and 3,698 households in the same time.

     By 2035, the study area will have a total of 8,742 households and 12,658 employees. Figure 18
     shows the comparison of jobs and population growth by county.

Vacant Buildable Land ­ Unconstrained Developable Land

To determine whether the expected growth in households and jobs can be accommodated within
the study area, the amount of vacant land within the study area was calculated, and the portion
within designated floodplain areas was subtracted from the total. Assuming that the remaining
developable land would be developed at the densities specified in the Orange County
Comprehensive Plan and Durham Future Land Use Plan, the number of jobs and households that
would be accommodated at these densities was then calculated.

The portion of the study area within Orange County, including the study area within the Town of
Chapel Hill limits, has about 330 acres of vacant land remaining of which about 225 (70%) is not
constrained by floodplains. Assuming that development of the vacant parcels will occur within
the densities specified in the Comprehensive Plan adopted in 2002, The current zoning
classifications could accommodate up to 1,444 new jobs and 482 new households
(approximately 1,109 people) within the Orange County portion of the study area. This area is
expected to grow by 727 jobs and 762 households from 2005 to 2035. The vacant land under its
current zoning appears to be somewhat inadequate to accommodate the forecast households and
is more than sufficient for the forecast employment. Several developments under construction
such as the 54 East project and recently constructed housing developments in the Meadowmont
neighborhood were not counted as vacant land, although these areas may be able to absorb some
of the forecast household growth. Tables 5 and 6 show the employment and household
capacities for Orange County within the study area.

In Orange County a significant portion of the remaining vacant land is under public ownership.
This ownership is dominated by the University of North Carolina and UNC Endowment. Other
owners include the Town of Chapel Hill, school district and public utilities. For the purposes of
capacity, the UNC owned properties were included under their current zoning designations.

The portion of the study area within Durham County, including the study area within the City of
Durham limits, has about 375 acres of vacant land in the study area, all of which is fully
buildable. Under current future land use designations, this land could accommodate up to 3,475
new jobs and 3,125 new households (about 7,188 people) within the Durham County portion of
the study area. This area is expected to grow by 12,658 jobs and 8,742 households from 2005 to
2035. The area falls short in land supply for the forecast households and employment. Full
buildout of the study area would at current designations would only accommodate 36 percent of
the forecast households and 27 percent of the forecast jobs. While there are several
developments under construction that were not accounted for in the land capacity analysis, most
jobs and households could not be accommodated with the current future land use designations.
One alternative to accommodate the growth is infill development on underutilized land or
redevelopment. Tables 7 and 8 show the employment and household capacities on vacant land
for Durham County within the study area. Development densities are from the Future Land Use
Plan and are calculated on both the high and low end of each range, providing a minimum and
maximum capacity depending on the individual site plans proposed for each parcel.

Potential Redevelopment - Underutilized Commercial & Aging Multi-Family development

In addition to vacant land, areas of potential redevelopment could also accommodate future
growth within the study area. Parcels of non-residential land and single-family residential
parcels greater than five acres were identified as areas of potential redevelopment. Large lot
residential uses are often displaced by more intensive transit-supportive development over time
in areas with high expected growth rates, such as this study area. These large lot single-family

NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study


residential parcels were not used in determining capacity, but are flagged for consideration in the
future scenarios.

Other parcels have been included as areas for potential change, as identified by the steering
committee members based on their local knowledge of activities in the area. Several residential
parcels, while usually not considered as having redevelopment potential, were included as areas
of potential change because of the noted land assembly activities likely to expand the land
capacity in the study area.

Both Orange and Durham Counties have capacity for redevelopment in the study area with great
potential to emerge as significant employment or mixed-use sites. Many of these will be served
by the proposed rail transit system which could help to support more intensive development.
Over time this transit investment could expand potential redevelopment beyond the identified
parcels. Often a major public infrastructure investment will first affect the most accessible land,
but, over time, will also extend its impact to land beyond the immediate vicinity.

Committed and Constrained - Single-Family, Designated Open Space, Floodplain

One of the primary natural constraints in the study area is the extensive floodplains that dissect
the landscape. Many of these are publicly owned and have no future development potential.
Suburban style single-family developments are apparent in the upland strands. These
subdivisions, with their cul-de-sac style development, are a constraint on street connectivity
through the area.

Households, population and employment forecast, and jobs/housing balance

Households in the study area are anticipated to double over the forecast period with Durham
County increasing by 150 percent and Orange by 50 percent At the same time employment will
more than triple with the vast majority allocated to Durham County (increasing by 500%) and
the smaller share to Orange County, again increasing by about 50 percent This is due in part to
the discrepancies in zoning intensity between the jurisdictions, but is also due to the difference in
the utilization of land in the study area. Under the current zoning and forecast Durham County
will, essentially, build out all land in the corridor while Orange County will retain some potential
for future development.

Conclusions of Capacity Analysis

Under current zoning the remaining vacant land in the study area will support all of the forecast
housing and the majority of employment and land that is currently under development in Durham
County will possibly fill the gap in employment. Infill of underutilized sites and some strategic
redevelopment or rezoning in Durham County could prove adequate to close the employment
gap, but without redevelopment, maximum capacity will be reached within the forecast horizon.

potential change, and vacant land within the study area.

Traffic Forecasts from Triangle Travel Demand Model

The land use and traffic analyses used the same assumptions from the Triangle Travel Demand
Model, as indicated in Table 9 below.

The DCHC MPO travel demand model was employed to forecast annual daily traffic (ADT)
volumes for the study area for the mid-term (year 2015) and long-term future (year 2035) to
provide a preliminary idea of what traffic may look like in the next 25 years. The forecasted
volumes and their corresponding levels of service are shown in Table 10. The model's base year
is 2005. In some instances, the 2009 ADT is larger than the forecast 2015 ADT, where the
actual growth rate has exceeded the expected growth rate. The travel demand model that
forecasted these preliminary volumes does not include many of the collector streets proposed for
construction in the future. As this corridor study moves forward, the development of alternative
scenarios will dictate possible proposed land uses, densities and alterations to the roadway
network. Any additional streets added to the travel demand model will relieve the existing
streets to some degree, particularly Farrington Road, George King Road and others within the
vicinity. The forecasts below reflect the current modeling tool available, and will change as the
model is tweaked for each future scenario. For the future scenarios, a more in-depth analysis of
historical traffic volumes and comparison of the base year volumes with the will inform a more
comprehensive future

The forecast levels of service were determined with the planning level FDOT generalized LOS
tables. The analysis for the refined future scenarios will include NCLOS for a detailed and
comprehensive level of service and capacity analysis.

The roadway improvements within the study area from the DCHC MPO 2035 Long Range
Transportation Plan were included in future analyses. By 2035, the portion of NC-54 from
Barbee Chapel Road to the I-40 interchange is planned to be widened to 6 lanes, NC-54 east of
the Leigh Farm Road/ Quadrangle Drive is planned to be widened to 4 lanes, and the I-40 HOV
lanes will be constructed and in operation.

In general, traffic volumes along NC-54 are expected to grow at an annual rate around two
percent per year (in the past 10 years traffic on this corridor has grown at a rate of about three
percent per year). Currently, ADT volumes range from 44,300 to 50,000 vehicles per day on
NC-54 between I-40 and US 15/501. In 2015, these volumes are projected to range from 48,100
to 55,100. In 2035, these volumes are projected to range from 66,500 to 83,100.

On I-40 the current daily volume of traffic north of the NC-54 interchange is 78,000. South of
the NC-54 interchange, the volume is 105,000. By 2015, these volumes are expected to grow to
91,500 and 121,500, respectively. By 2035, the I-40 HOV lanes should be implemented, and the
travel demand model projects that the ADT on this interstate will be 121,900 north of the NC-54
interchange, and 161,600 south of the NC-54 interchange. This equates to an annual growth of
about 1.5 percent per year (in the past 10 years, traffic on I-40 has grown by about three percent
per year enabled by the widening of the freeway from four to six lanes).

Farrington Road north of NC-54 is expected to have a very high growth rate of about 3.5 percent
per year (in the past 10 years Farrington Road has grown by about seven percent per year).
Within the next 26 years, the traffic on this road will more than double from 10,700 vehicles per
day to 26,300 vehicles per day. Farrington Road south of NC-54 is expected to grow at a similar
rate, about three percent per year.

Southwest Durham Drive is expected to be constructed by 2025, and in 2035 it is projected to
carry about 8,500 vehicles per day.

NC-54 / I-40 Corridor Study


The `Trend' Scenario
Based on the review of past development patterns, projected growth and the focus areas
identified in the adopted planning documents, the Trend Scenario can be characterized by:

       ·   Continued development to accommodate the projected growth in population and
           employment along the corridor serviced primarily by personal auto transportation and
           bus transit.

       ·   Development of land at the lower end of allowable zoning densities

       ·   Consumption of most vacant land in the corridor following the same pattern of
           disconnected roadways

       ·   Transportation improvements to the existing roadway, that will in turn encourage
           more auto traffic

Meadowmont, a recent development in the corridor, sets a pattern that conforms more closely to
traditional neighborhood development and may set a trend for future development in the region.
The development of Leigh Village may continue that trend, but it should be noted that there are
no remaining large parcels in the study area that will accommodate such a complete mixed-use
development without significant effort to assemble smaller parcels into a consolidated plan. In
the absence of an overall plan for the corridor it is more likely that development will continue to
be piecemeal efforts by individual developers resulting in similar patterns that already exist in
the corridor. Thus it is anticipated that the available land under the Trend Scenario would be
built at the lower end of densities allowable under current zoning. This will accommodate the
current forecast, but in the process will consume all available vacant land in the study area. The
result will most likely be a development pattern that is not supportive of the proposed transit
system.

Resistance to changes by existing residents is a common occurrence in suburban areas such as
this. The tendency is to conform to neighboring development patterns rather than risk the ire of
local residents.

Land Use and Transportation Integration
The future land use of the vacant and redevelopable land within the study area can support the
projected growth within the corridor. However, the transportation infrastructure will not be able
to support the traffic growth if current transportation and development trends continue, as the
roads and intersections are already operation at failing levels of service.

If land use and transportation trends do not change, the economic vitality of the corridor will
decline. The congestion will drive away many prospective businesses, and new residents will be
hesitant to relocate to an area where they must face heavy congestion everyday. This directly
affects the ability of major employers, including the UNC medical center, to attract and retain
employees, and create an environment that is supportive of its mission to provide quality health
care for all North Carolinians. Increased congestion will also affect the environmental quality of

the area. As vehicles spend more time idling in traffic, the air quality will decline. Continuing
to provide surface parking will increase surface runoff, attributing to a host of other
environmental problems such as soil pollution and water quality issues, especially critical given
the wetlands and floodplains in the area.

Future Scenarios
Given the development pressures, environmental constraints and established neighborhoods that
exist within the NC-54 corridor, there are several possible alternate scenarios to the trend that
could warrant further consideration and evaluation.

In planning for the continuation of transit service and the construction of the light rail system,
channeling development towards future station areas to preserve the capacity of the corridor
could be one possible scenario. The UNC Medical Center is already a huge force in the future of
this corridor. The continued development of medical offices, complexes and workforce housing
could have an effect on the corridor. If correctly channeled to future station areas, this
development could help the future transit systems be very successful. Relocating the park-and-
ride facilities off the corridor could streamline transit service through the corridor.

Prioritizing environmental stewardship and utilizing the corridor's natural features to connect
and promote alternative transportation is another future concept worth noting. Using smaller
scale development to encourage pedestrian trips, and preserving and enhancing a greenway
system with off-road commuter bike trails and could transform the corridor's character.

Because the turning movement counts were compiled from several sources, the volumes
did not balance across the corridor. Volumes between intersections differed by hundreds
of vehicles. Ideally, the volumes could be slightly adjusted to balance exactly. However,
adjusting volumes beyond 10-15% of the original count is unacceptable.

Using the collected ADT volumes as a guide, we adjusted the turning movement volumes
to ensure that the volumes balanced on the Chapel Hill side of the corridor, particularly
between East Barbee Chapel Road and Burning Tree Drive. We also adjusted volumes to
balance between Farrington Road and the Leigh Farm Road/ Quadrangle Drive
intersection.

The turning movement counts at the Farrington Road and I-40 ramps were surprisingly
high (approximately 500 to 700 vehicles higher than the adjacent intersection at Leigh
Farm Road). It would be against professional engineering judgment to adjust the
volumes more than 20% from the original counts. This discrepancy occurs between the
intersections of Farrington Road and Huntingridge Road. In the future conditions
analysis, the volume projections will be balanced throughout the corridor.

To analyze the existing traffic conditions, we utilized Synchro Version 7 software with
the existing coordinated signal timing plans. Within the Durham city limits, the four
traffic signals between Leigh Farm Road and Farrington Road change timing plans within
the AM and PM peak hours.

The available turning movement count data indicates that the AM peak hour is between
7:45 and 8:45 AM at the Farrington Road intersection and between 8:00 and 9:00 AM at
both I-40 ramp intersections. The time of day based coordinated signal timing plans
currently implements two different signal timing plans within this peak time. From 7:00
AM to 8:30 AM a very high cycle length plan is implemented (200 second cycle length at
Farrington Rd and I-40) and a different plan then runs at 8:30 with a 150 second cycle
length.

The available turning movement count data indicates that the PM peak hour is between
5:00 and 6:00 PM. The same timing plan coordination strategy occurs during the PM
peak hour, with a 150 second cycle length plan implemented from 3:30 to 5:20 PM and
then a 200 second cycle length plan starting at 5:20 PM.

After discussion, the NC 54 stakeholders and select steering committee members reached
a decision to analyze existing conditions with a modification to how the peak hour traffic
volumes are utilized. The peak hour volume entry would actually be the peak 15 minutes
multiplied by four, and combined with a peak hour factor (PHF) of 1 as well as the higher
cycle length timing plan (which operates during the heaviest traffic flow) the model
would actually simulate the peak 15 minutes. The count data that is currently available
does not specifically identify the peak 15 minutes; however, the peak 15 minutes can be
calculated utilizing the related peak hour factor (PHF) data. This does assume that the
peak 15 minutes is the same for each direction at each intersection and that the higher
cycle length plan operates during the peak 15 minutes (which is reasonable as the higher
volume would be the reason for a higher cycle length). The resulting Synchro model
would then reflect the peak 15 minutes of the corridor.

As a test, this option was modeled in a mini Synchro model to include the I-40
interchange area and Farrington Road. The queuing in the area as reported by Synchro
compared favorably to observed traffic conditions.

The turning movement counts, balanced volume network, and Synchro model outputs are
included in the rest of the Traffic Technical Appendix. Electronic versions of the
Synchro model have been included in the submission of the Community Profile
document.

- Note that there was a rear end crash just east of the intersection. The incident closed the right most lane from approximately 4:55 to 5:03. After that, the vehicles were moved off the road.

- Note that there were large queues observed in the EB direction in the PM peak. Approaching Huntingridge, the EB queue (after the EB phase turned red) was regularly 200 - 300 vehicles from the start
of the count at 4PM until 4:30PM. From 4:30P until the crash at 4:55P the queue was much smaller and cleared every cycle. For approximately 15 minutes after the crash cleared the road, the queue
was 400 vehicles plus. From 5:30PM to about 5:40 PM and again from 6:05P to 6:15PM, the EB queue from downstream backed up into the Huntingride intersection. The EB queue approaching
Huntingridge was regularly 200 - 300 vehicles until the end of the count at 6:30P.

    Values shown are presented as two-way annual average daily volumes for levels of service and are for the automobile/truck modes unless specifically stated. Although presented as
    daily volumes, they actually represent peak hour direction conditions with applicable K and D factors applied. This table does not constitute a standard and should be used only for
    general planning applications. The computer models from which this table is derived should be used for more specific planning applications. The table and deriving computer models
    should not be used for corridor or intersection design, where more refined techniques exist. Calculations are based on planning applications of the Highway Capacity Manual, Bicycle
    LOS Model, Pedestrian LOS Model and Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, respectively for the automobile/truck, bicycle, pedestrian and bus modes.
2
    Level of service for the bicycle and pedestrian modes in this table is based on number of motorized vehicles,
    not number of bicyclists or pedestrians using the facility.
3
    Buses per hour shown are only for the peak hour in the single direction of the higher traffic flow.
    * For oversaturated conditions during peak hour, subtract 10% from the LOS E (capacity volumes).
     This number becomes the new maximum service volume for LOS D, and LOS E cannot be achieved.

*** Not applicable for that level of service letter grade. For the automobile mode, volumes greater than level of service D
 become F because intersection capacities have been reached. For the bicycle mode, the level of service letter grade (including              605 Suwannee Street, MS 19

    Values shown are presented as two-way annual average daily volumes for levels of service and are for the automobile/truck modes unless specifically stated. Although presented as daily
    volumes, they actually represent peak hour direction conditions with applicable K and D factors applied. This table does not constitute a standard and should be used only for general
    planning applications. The computer models from which this table is derived should be used for more specific planning applications. The table and deriving computer models should not
    be used for corridor or intersection design, where more refined techniques exist. Calculations are based on planning applications of the Highway Capacity Manual, Bicycle LOS Model,
    Pedestrian LOS Model and Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, respectively for the automobile/truck, bicycle, pedestrian and bus modes.

    Level of service for the bicycle and pedestrian modes in this table is based on number of motorized vehicles, not number of
    bicyclists or pedestrians using the facility.

*** Not applicable for that level of service letter grade. For the automobile mode, volumes greater than level of service D
 become F because intersection capacities have been reached. For the bicycle mode, the level of service letter grade (including         605 Suwannee Street, MS 19
 F) is not achievable because there is no maximum vehicle volume threshold using table input value defaults.                            Tallahassee, FL 32399-0450

  Values shown are presented as hourly two-way volumes for levels of service and are for the automobile/truck modes unless specifically stated. Although presented as peak hour two-
way volumes, they actually represent peak hour peak direction conditions with an applicable D factor applied. This table does not constitute a standard and should be used only for
general planning applications. The computer models from which this table is derived should be used for more specific planning applications. The table and deriving computer models
should not be used for corridor or intersection design, where more refined techniques exist. Calculations are based on planning applications of the Highway Capacity Manual, Bicycle
LOS Model, Pedestrian LOS Model and Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, respectively for the automobile/truck, bicycle, pedestrian and bus modes.
2
  Level of service for the bicycle and pedestrian modes in this table is based on number of motorized vehicles, not number of
bicyclists or pedestrians using the facility.
3
    Buses per hour shown are only for the peak hour in the single direction of the higher traffic flow.
* For oversaturated conditions during peak hour, subtract 10% from the LOS E (capacity volumes).
 This number becomes the new maximum service volume for LOS D, and LOS E cannot be achieved.                                                 Source:

    Multiply the corresponding two-directional volumes in this table by 0.6.


1
  Values shown are presented as hourly two-way volumes for levels of service and are for the automobile/truck modes unless specifically stated. Although presented as peak hour two-
way volumes, they actually represent peak hour direction conditions with an applicable D factor applied. This table does not constitute a standard and should be used only for general
planning applications. The computer models from which this table is derived should be used for more specific planning applications. The table and deriving computer models should not
be used for corridor or intersection design, where more refined techniques exist. Calculations are based on planning applications of the Highway Capacity Manual, Bicycle LOS Model,
Pedestrian LOS Model and Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, respectively for the automobile/truck, bicycle, pedestrian and bus modes.
2
  Level of service for the bicycle and pedestrian modes in this table is based on number of motorized vehicles, not number of
bicyclists or pedestrians using the facility.
3
    Buses per hour shown are only for the peak hour in the single direction of the higher traffic flow.                                      Source:

  Values shown are presented as hourly directional volumes for levels of service and are for the automobile/truck modes unless specifically stated. To convert to annual average daily
traffic volumes, these volumes must be divided by appropriate D and K factors. This table does not constitute a standard and should be used only for general planning applications. The
computer models from which this table is derived should be used for more specific planning applications. The table and deriving computer models should not be used for corridor or
intersection design, where more refined techniques exist. Calculations are based on planning applications of the Highway Capacity Manual, Bicycle LOS Model, Pedestrian LOS Model
and Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, respectively for the automobile/truck, bicycle, pedestrian and bus modes.
2
    Level of service for the bicycle and pedestrian modes in this table is based on number of motorized vehicles,
    not number of bicyclists or pedestrians using the facility.
3
    Buses per hour shown are only for the peak hour in the single direction of the higher traffic flow.
* For oversaturated conditions during peak hour, subtract 10% from the LOS E (capacity volumes).
  This number becomes the new maximum service volume for LOS D, and LOS E cannot be achieved.

*** Not applicable for that level of service letter grade. For the automobile mode, volumes greater than level of service D
 become F because intersection capacities have been reached. For the bicycle mode, the level of service letter grade (including               605 Suwannee Street, MS 19
 F) is not achievable because there is no maximum vehicle volume threshold using table input value defaults.                                  Tallahassee, FL 32399-0450

1
   Values shown are presented as hourly directional volumes for levels of service and are for the automobile/truck modes unless specifically stated. To convert to annual average daily
traffic volumes, these volumes must be divided by appropriate D and K factors. This table does not constitute a standard and should be used only for general planning applications. The
computer models from which this table is derived should be used for more specific planning applications. The table and deriving computer models should not be used for corridor or
intersection design, where more refined techniques exist. Calculations are based on planning applications of the Highway Capacity Manual, Bicycle LOS Model, Pedestrian LOS Model
and Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, respectively for the automobile/truck, bicycle, pedestrian and bus modes.
2
  Level of service for the bicycle and pedestrian modes in this table is based on number of motorized vehicles, not number of
bicyclists or pedestrians using the facility.
3
    Buses per hour shown are only for the peak hour in the single direction of the higher traffic flow.

*** Not applicable for that level of service letter grade. For the automobile mode, volumes greater than level of service D
 become F because intersection capacities have been reached. For the bicycle mode, the level of service letter grade (including             605 Suwannee Street, MS 19
 F) is not achievable because there is no maximum vehicle volume threshold using table input value defaults.                                Tallahassee, FL 32399-0450

Center and Neighborhood Center and are described in
further detail below.


Community Center Station Area
Community centers function as local centers for economic
and community activity including urban and town centers
served by a variety of primary and secondary transit
services. Residential densities are usually lower than
residential densities in regional centers, but the mixture
of uses is more balanced between residential and
employment uses. Intensity of development in community
centers tends to be focused within walking distance of
the transit station or stop. The development patterns in
community centers range from urban to suburban with
moderate block sizes, lot coverage, and intensity/density.
Parking is typically structured closer to the transit station
or stop.

projects that exhibit land use characteristics within the
ranges described in the place type tables would likely
receive a favorable land use rating by FTA's standards.

Calibrating to Local Conditions
The placetypes described in this guidebook represent
prototypical conditions. Therefore, when applied to
existing conditions across Florida communities, the station
area level guidance requires calibration to the local
context. This calibration process should be iterative in
nature and should follow the following steps:

Existing Conditions Assessment
The existing conditions assessment entails evaluation of
the proposed station area to assess existing population
and employment density, productions and attractions/
activity centers, and land development (availability,
assembly, and use). This assessment provides the baseline
for determining how transit-ready existing conditions may
already be, or how much change is required within the
station area to achieve more transit supportive conditions
as defined by the range of station area placetypes.

Placetype Selection
In addition to the existing conditions assessment, selecting
the desired station area placetype should also be driven
by a local visioning process or other means whereby the
future development potential/desires are defined. This
combination of existing conditions and future development
visioning is essential to aligning community goals with
station area design.

Neighborhood Center - Illustrative Examples
The Neighborhood Center station areas are also mixed
use places, but are characterized by a higher residential
mix than employment. They have a local-serving mixed-
use and relatively dense housing stock. These include
townhouses, apartment/condo and small lot single-family
residences. The street network is connected with relatively
small blocks. This retains the ease of walking through the
district. The examples shown here illustrate some building
types and development patterns that are appropriate to
reach the desired built form and intensity for Neighborhood

Access Management
Access management is a comprehensive approach for
controlling the location, spacing, design and operation
of entrances, street intersections, median openings, and                                                  Top:

down, disrupting the flow of traffic. As the number of
conflict points increase, so does traffic congestion and
traffic crashes affecting the traffic carrying capacity of
the road. Access management should be used to minimize
unnecessary driveway connections and to encourage
                                                                                                         Bottom:
shared and cross-access between adjacent parcels. When                                                10 entrances,
applied, access management can reduce the number of full                                               29 parcels
access points and include median separators, thus helping
to create a refuge for pedestrian crossings at mid-block
locations. Managing access, therefore, seeks to limit and
separate entrances, intersections, median openings, and
traffic signals in order to maintain and improve the flow of
traffic and enhance public safety. The benefits include:

  · Less traffic congestion.
  · Lower fuel consumption and air pollution.
  · Fewer and less severe traffic crashes.
  · More efficient movement of people and goods
    that promotes economic development by
    expanding the market area and labor market
    for businesses.
  · Preserving highway traffic carrying capacity to
    avoid having to widen them or build new ones.

Connectivity and Block Size
Connectivity
Interconnected transportation networks can provide
advantages such as enhanced vehicular and pedestrian
access, reduced traffic congestion, and enable emergency
vehicles to respond in a more timely manner. Well-connected
areas promote pedestrian activity and encourage walking in
place of driving for local trips.



                                                                  encouraged

Block Size
Smaller scaled blocks help promote walkability and
mixed-use development by:

·   Creating an increased sense of location and direction
·   Decreasing and breaking down the distance between
    intersections and destinations
·   Promoting a diversity of building types within closer
    proximity
·   Providing increased visibility for businesses and
    offices                                                   encouraged

Recommended block sizes range from 200' - 800' in length,
with the average length recommended at 400'.

Streets Types
Streets and corridors provide the framework for Transit
Oriented Development. Effective street design is critical
to the success of a mixed-use activity center. Streets
must provide an efficient and interconnected network for
vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. Street function and
appearance must be in balance with the built environment
and create a pleasant and safe experience for travelers
and residents with homes and/or businesses facing the
street.

To ensure a lively street setting, street networks must avoid
concentrating travel on a few large roads. A more diverse
roadway fabric provides multiple routes of access and
evenly distributes activity to create a more energized urban
environment. The dispersal of vehicle loads allows streets
to be narrower and treated at a human scale. Streetscape
elements provide a softened appearance and enhance the
quality and appeal for pedestrians. On-street parking
and street trees help define a comfortable pedestrian
realm buffered from vehicular traffic. Narrow road widths
naturally reduce travel speeds and give greater spatial
enclosure to the street environment. Enclosure allows the
streetscape to be experienced as an `urban room,' a space
that attracts pedestrians and jump-starts activity.

Multimodal Infrastructure
Design buildings, streetscape, with multimodal infrastructure
interconnect to produce a high-quality, pedestrian-
oriented environment. Narrow streets help to calm traffic
and reduce pedestrian crossing distances. Bicycle lanes,
on-street parking, transit easements, and streetscaping
elements such as landscaping and light posts, help provide
a comforting barrier between vehicle traffic and sidewalk
activity. With buildings fronting directly onto the sidewalk
and parking relegated to the rear, pedestrians have direct
access to shops, dining, services, entertainment, or other
daily activities. Bus shelters and sidewalk furniture allow
for passengers to comfortably wait or pedestrians to rest
and relax. Bicycle parking located near transit stops and
building entrances provides convenient transfer access to
cyclists. The remainder of this section on Complete Streets
and Multimodal Features describes in greater detail
different elements and features to be considered in design
and development.

Sidewalks
The sidewalk is one of a variety of design elements
that together contribute to an active and vibrant
streetscape. Promoting a walkable environment
requires safe, accessible, and connected sidewalks
that unite the pedestrian with a desired destination
or activity.

Public sidewalks should be provided on both sides
of all urban roadways. Sidewalks should be wide
enough to comfortably serve the volume and type of
pedestrian traffic expected in a particular area. For
example, certain urban core areas may benefit from
a sidewalk wide enough to accommodate heavy
pedestrian traffic in addition to outdoor dining or
retail display. All sidewalks should be designed
to have a minimum width of five feet. Sidewalks
and pedestrian facilities should meet or exceed
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations to

the elderly and persons with disabilities throughout
the pedestrian network. Curb ramps should be
included at all intersections and pedestrian crossings.
Pedestrian pads at transit stops create a paved link
from the sidewalk to the curb, making it easier for
wheelchairs to get on the bus.

Sidewalks should maintain a 3' minimum separation
between the road and the paved sidewalk. This
zone provides a buffer between pedestrians and
vehicular traffic.

Street trees are recommended to provide shade
for pedestrians and are also an effective way to
ensure a comfortable pedestrian zone protected
from moving traffic. This 3' separation may be used
as a planting strip for street shade trees with a
caliper of 2.5" to 3", spaced one for every 35' of
street frontage. Lighting and other amenities such as
benches or trash cans should be located either in the
"furnishings zone" between the street and sidewalk
or "frontage zone" next to the buildings and should
not obstruct visibility at intersections.

Pedestrian Crossings
Pedestrian crossings are a critical element of the pedestrian
network. Safe and convenient crosswalks make a sidewalk
system usable and appealing, encouraging pedestrian activity.
Ensuring that people can cross streets safely and conveniently
to access destinations is essential to creating an effective
transportation network. People who are traveling by other
modes will also need to cross streets; those who arrive by transit
or car may need to cross the street to access a destination
after getting off at a bus stop or parking, for example. People
need to be able to cross streets at intersections and mid-block
locations, at controlled (signals, stop signs, etc.) and uncontrolled
locations, on major streets and on minor streets. Getting across
the street can be one of the primary barriers to achieving true
accessibility and mobility, and every effort should be made to
accommodate efficient pedestrian crossings.

Crosswalks are needed to provide higher visibility to pedestrians
at logical crossing points. Basic crosswalks consist of reflective
white striping, although crosswalks with higher visibility, traffic
calming measures (raised crosswalks), or those that are more
aesthetically pleasing (colored concrete or brick crossings) are
more appropriate in commercial areas or locations with high
pedestrian volumes. To ensure safety and usability, crossing
distances should not exceed 50'. Care should be used so that
the surface does not impede wheelchair access or provide
a hazard for the visually impaired or elderly. Crosswalk
lighting should be provided at least to the level of general
street illumination, although higher luminance should be used
at key pedestrian crossings. Countdown pedestrian signals               Cross-walks and bulbouts provide higher visibility,

Bicycle Facilities
The selection of appropriate streets for bicycle lanes is
very important for the safety and the continuity of the
bicycle system. Streets that provide the most direct and
safest route to popular destinations such as, business
districts, schools, parks, etc., and trail heads should be
primary choices for inclusion on the on-street bicycle
system. Bicycle lanes should be provided on both sides
of the street. An exception may be made for multi-use
paths, where travel can move in both directions. Bicycle
facilities should provide continuous access from origin to
destination. To provide bicycle facilities in rural areas,
consider designating paved shoulders for shared use.
                                                                Designated Bike Lane with On-Street
Designated Bicycle Lanes                                                      Parking
A designated bicycle lane is a portion of the roadway
designated by striping, signing, and special pavement
markings for the exclusive use of bicyclists. For safety
purposes, sidewalks are not encouraged as substitutes for
bicycle lanes. Regulatory bike lane signs inform motorists
and bicyclists of this condition and are supplemented
with pavement markings, including striping. Bike lanes
are one-way facilities where the bike traffic moves in
the same direction as the adjacent vehicular movement.
In circumstances where on-street parking occurs, the bike
lane should be located between the parking area and the
travel way. Bike lanes should never be placed between
the parking lanes and the curb, and parking lanes should
be clearly marked with striping markings. The minimum
bike lane width for curb and gutter roadways should be
four feet. When on-street parking is present, the bike lane
width should be five feet wide. At intersections with right
turn lanes, the bicycle lane should continue adjacent to
the through lane between the through lane and the right
turn only lane. Advancing the stop bar in the bicycle lane       Designated Bike Lane w/o On-Street
                                                                              Parking
ahead of the stop bar for cars creates a queue area for
cyclists and increases their visibility to drivers.

Undesignated Bicycle Lanes (Paved Shoulders)
An undesignated bicycle lane, or paved shoulder, is open
to motorized traffic. The use of "Share the Road" signage
is useful to alert motorists to the likely and legitimate
presence of bicyclists and to encourage cooperation
between motorists and bicyclists.

Bicycle Sensitive Signals
Bicycle sensitive signals provide added incentive and
convenience for bicycle travel. Bicycle sensitive signals are
commonly used when bicycle lanes are located between
the through- and right-turning traffic lanes. The signal
sensors must be well-marked on the pavement with nearby
posted signs indicating that "X" marks the proper spot for
bicycles to trigger the traffic signals.                            Undesignated Bicycle Lane

Multi-Use Path
Like bicycle trails and sidewalks, multi-use trails can play
an integral role in completing the bicycle and pedestrian
network. Multi-use trails should be paved, with the
exception of those in environmentally sensitive areas
where pervious surfaces are recommended, and adhere
to the same lighting standards as pedestrian sidewalks.
Where adjacent to roadways, trails can replace sidewalks.
Trails should be clearly marked and easily accessible to
pedestrian and bicycle traffic. Center striping should be
considered to allow for free-flowing 2-way traffic.

Bicycle Parking
Secure, conveniently located bicycle parking is necessary
to encourage bicycle use as an alternative mode of
transportation. The bicycle parking area should be as
close or closer than the nearest parking space and located
in proximity to the building entrance to ensure visibility
and accessibility. Large, distant, or hidden bicycle parking
areas serving multiple buildings are discouraged. Smaller,
more convenient racks provide greater accessibility and
security for cyclists. The bicycle parking area location should
not inhibit pedestrian or vehicular flows. Additionally, the
area should provide aisles separating individual racks.
The minimum aisle width between each row of parked
bicycles should be 48 inches. Wider aisles should be
used to accommodate areas with heavy bicycle traffic. A
sheltered rack area located adjacent to a building wall
or an awning is preferred to protect bicycles and riders
from the elements. Effective bicycle racks should support
the bicycle upright by its frame in two places. This allows       An ample amount of bicycle parking located close
for the bicycle to be secured in two places and prevents          the building entrance encourages bicycle activity.
the bicycle from tipping over. The rack must be anchored
and resistant to metal cutting tools to prevent vandalism.

Bicycle lockers are recommended for extremely high
traffic, high turnover areas where bicycles are often
parked for extended periods. A locker box should provide
a sturdy, secure, and weather proof place to store a
bicycle, equipment, and additional personal items. Parking
garages, railroad and bus stations, and other transit hubs
are examples of locations that should have bicycle lockers
available in addition to bicycle racks. Lockers should be
located in an area that is monitored to provide security. As a
minimum standard for commercial and retail development,
one bicycle parking space should be provided for every
four motor vehicle spaces. Multi-family residential uses and
public institutional uses, such as community schools, should
provide one bike space per three vehicle spaces.

Medians

Medians are raised barriers in the center portion of
the street or roadway that can serve as a landing
place for pedestrians who cross a street mid-block or
at an intersection location, storing or restricting left-turn
vehicles, managing access, and providing an attractive
landscaping or streetscaping treatment.               Raised
medians are most useful on high-volume roadways. They
manage access and reduce conflict points thus serving
the dual purpose of preserving roadway capacity and
safety. They should be designed to provide tactile cues
for pedestrians with visual impairments to indicate the
border between the pedestrian refuge area and the
motorized vehicle roadway. Medians installed to serve
as pedestrian refuges should ideally be 8' in width, with
6' being the recommended minimum. Median widths to
accommodate left turn lanes, should allow 16-18', and
larger than 18' should only be used in more suburban
or rural areas. The raised medians serve multiple
improvement functions including:

     Separation of opposing traffic movements
     Manage motor vehicle traffic and provide com-
     fortable left-hand turning pockets
     Provide a landing for pedestrians crossing the
     street

Buildings and Frontages
Building frontages are the interface between the public street
and the building interior. Treatment of building fronts should
reflect the building use. Retail frontage is intended to draw the
public inside. Residential frontage protects the privacy of the
interior, yet allows the residents to observe and engage with
neighbors and passersby.

The ground level should always be given the most careful
consideration. Ground floor heights, facade articulation, setbacks,
and entry design have a critical impact on the overall street
environment. The typical progression from street to building
includes vehicular traffic, on-street parking, landscaping elements
and street trees, sidewalk, and building entry. The dimensions
and relationships between elements vary depending upon building types and uses, vehicle traffic, and pedestrian
traffic. Minimum ground floor heights ensure that the civic nature of the streetscape is maintained.

Building Recommendations
Orientation
Buildings should be sited to complement the existing built
environment, while recognizing the characteristics of the
specific project site. Building placement must respect
important existing features of the site, such as natural
elements or historical structures. Building orientation should
balance the combined impacts to building occupants,
pedestrians, and open space users. Building entries                      encouraged            discouraged

should border main streets and public thoroughfares
to foster vibrant, walkable streetscapes and allow for
clear pedestrian access and circulation. When possible,
principles of passive solar design, such as screening the
south elevation to avoid daytime heat gain, should help
orient buildings. Parking and building service equipment
should be placed at the rear of the building lot, visually
removed from the streetscape.

Massing
Massing describes the physical form of a building or group
of buildings. To maintain a comfortable scale, building
massing must be carefully considered in building design.
                                                                 encouraged
Massing should be compatible with surrounding buildings
to create a streetscape that maintains a consistent scale,
while allowing unique articulation between buildings. A
single, uniform building mass should be avoided. Variations
in height and horizontal divisions may be used to create
facade articulation. Visual aspects of larger buildings must
be detailed to maintain a sense of human scale, particularly
at the pedestrian level. Varying window treatments and
facade materials help break the mass of a building. Facade
elements should highlight primary entrances and different
building uses. Roof equipment should be screened from
view using setbacks and parapets.

Blueprint for Mobility



Floor Articulation
In multiple story buildings, floors should have distinctive
changes in exterior material, texture, ornamentation, and
color. Floor articulation is especially important for mixed-
use buildings. Facade treatment should reflect different
interior uses, combining larger degrees of transparency
for retail space and smaller openings for residential use.
Typically, the first one or two stories of multiple story
buildings are an architectural base meant to complement
human scale and movement. The increased floor height of
the base and covered walkways tie the building to the
pedestrian environment. Prominent facade treatments
at ground level highlight public entrances. Upper stories
may be slightly setback from the base and treated with
different materials and colors, particularly useful for
mixed-use development.
Entries
Building entry treatment should vary by use. Retail,
office, and residential entries have different purposes and
priorities. Retail space should have a ground-floor entry
fronting the public thoroughfare and visible to pedestrians.
The entrance should incorporate transparent areas that
integrate the interior space with street activity. Signage
may be incorporated into the building facade or covered
walkway. Often, offices require more private interiors.
Office entries should also front public thoroughfares to
ensure visibility. Residential entries, when part of a dense
area, are set to the side or rear of the building. Often,
significant entries are located along the street edge, but
side and rear options handle routine traffic. In less dense
areas, single-family residence entries are set back from
the street right-of-way. Covered porches and stoops are
suggested to make visual and spatial connections between
the house and street.
Transparency
Transparent building façades generate interest for
the pedestrian and improve security through enhanced
visibility. For non-residential uses, storefront windows and   encouraged
doors help create an inviting environment for pedestrians.
Shop windows break the monotony of a street wall and
welcome pedestrians in off the sidewalk. Additionally,
where facades create a continuous street wall, maximizing
street-front fenestration will provide the best opportunity
for natural interior lighting. Despite following the general
design principles of articulation and massing, the building
to the right remains unwelcoming to the pedestrian because
it lacks appropriate fenestration. Awnings, typically used
to highlight entryways or windows, appear out of place
when not part of a window or door.

Arcade Front
Retail and Mixed Use
An arcade is a series of arches or piers often used to support
an overhead covering, creating a partially enclosed and
protected walkway. Arcade fronts draw the building to
the edge of the right-of-way, integrating the sidewalk with
the built space. The shared arcade space provides shade
and weather protection. Ground floor retail functions can
expand into the arcade space. The covered space is an
ideal setting for outdoor cafe and restaurant seating.

Stoop Front
Retail and Mixed Use
A stoop front provides a comfortable interface between
the public streetscape and residential units. Elevating
the entrance above sidewalk grade helps minimize the
building setback. The `stoop' should be oriented towards
the street to encourage interaction between residents,
neighbors, and passersby. Stoop fronts may mix with shop
fronts on a street.

Dooryard Front
Residential and Mixed Use
A dooryard front includes a paved or landscaped surface
between the right-of-way and front facade line and
provides gradual transition from sidewalk to building. The
large transitional space and elevated entrance allow the
building to negotiate significant elevational changes. The
open surface can be enclosed as a porch or retained as
outdoor space.

Plaza
The most formal public space, a plaza, is generally less
than half the size of a block and located at the intersection
of important thoroughfares. It is devoted to civic uses and
commercial activity and surrounded by buildings on all
sides. Its landscape is composed primarily of durable
pavement and formally planted trees. Features such as
fountains, statues, and other vertical elements help mark
the civic prominence of the plaza. These architectural
features are most successful when planned in accordance
with a strong visual axis, allowing the plaza to be read
from a distance.




Urban Park
An urban park occupies at least a full downtown block.
Its landscape consists of lawns, paved walks, and shade
trees. Formal fountains and statues are also often
incorporated. Landscape elements can help to organize
the park into a series of smaller spaces that offer diverse
qualities and uses. Urban parks may be surrounded by
civic buildings and residential uses. In certain instances,
civic buildings can accompany the park on a shared
block. Urban parks may establish Farmers' Markets as a
potential use to promote economic development activity
in the area. Urban parks provide an excellent terminus
for greenways and bicycle routes originating outside the
core. In most cases, it is appropriate to frame the park
within a visual axis.

Pocket Park
A pocket park is a small park that often occupies a `left
over' space between buildings. Typically no longer than
100' of frontage, pocket parks provide vegetation,
shade, and open space within densely built areas. Due
to their small scale, pocket parks predominantly serve
immediately adjacent buildings and thoroughfares. These
small, informal breaks in the dense urban fabric provide
alternatives to more prominent civic spaces such as urban
parks and plazas. Pocket parks may have Farmers;
Markets to promote activity and economic development
activity in the area.




Neighborhood Park
A neighborhood park is an open public space serving
a residential area. The space may be used for civic
gatherings and recreation. Neighborhood parks provide
a safe open area free from moving traffic for children
and neighborhood residents. Neighborhood parks may
be bound by residences or small-scale institutional or
civic buildings to form a common green. These parks are
intended to serve the local area, unlike recreational parks,
which serve a larger residential population.

Recreational Park
Recreational parks are open public space, ranging from
three to ten acres, reserved for civic gatherings and
recreation. Often, recreational parks are designed
around existing natural features. Its landscape consists
primarily of grassy areas, paved or unpaved walks, and
shade trees. Formal playing fields may be established to
serve community needs. The park should be surrounded
by a mix of residential, commercial, and civic buildings.
Recreational parks may also serve nearby institutions.
Parking needs and other necessary facilities must also be
considered.




Stormwater
Planning for stormwater detention is essential to
maintaining an ecological balance. Stormwater detention
prevents flooding and helps decrease the amount of
sediment and other pollutants that flow into other bodies
of water. Stormwater ponds should not disturb wetlands,
as wetlands natural stormwater retention areas. The use
of shared stormwater retention systems for multiple sites
is recommended.

Stormwater ponds and drainage swales should be
developed as aesthetic amenities, with regard for the
surrounding landscape and buildings. In urban settings,
ponds may become formal pools with retaining walls,
integrated into the dense fabric as a attractive public
elements. Open space ponds should incorporate gradual
side slopes and landscaped vegetation to create a natural
setting. Gradual slopes reduce erosion and operate
as safety features, eliminating the need for fencing.
Stormwater ponds that must be enclosed should be located

of stormwater for site irrigation is encouraged.

Greenways
Greenways can range in form from narrow urban
trail corridors to winding river corridors to very wide,
wilderness-like landscape linkages. The diversity of
greenway types and forms, combined with geographic
differences, means that different kinds of greenways
should function differently, both ecologically and
socially.

Ecologically, greenways can protect natural areas
and diminish the isolating, disruptive effects of habitat
fragmentation on wildlife and water resources. From
a social perspective, greenways provide places for
recreation and help maintain the scenic quality of
landscapes. For transportation mobility and access, it
is important for greenways to function by connecting
places where people want to go, such as neighborhoods,
business centers, shopping areas, schools and parks.

Typically, greenways that traverse environmentally
sensitive lands can be considered "rural greenways"
and corridors surrounding roadway networks can be
considered "urban greenways." Multi-use trails will
incorporate bicycle and pedestrian supportive design
elements. The intersection of each greenway and multi-
use trail should create a sense of place through pocket
parks or a commercial node.

Reducing minimum off-street parking requirements and
setting average-usage standards instead of peak-
usage standards make additional land available for
development. Allowing developers to count on-street
parking towards their requirement helps alleviate off-
street parking needs. Shared parking allows activities
and functions with different peak hours to use the same
spaces, significantly cutting down the total number of
spaces.

Structured parking is appropriate in high-density areas.
Garages reduce the total amount of paved area and can
fit well into an urban area, maintaining scale and facade
articulation.     Wrapping structured parking around
the perimeter with liner buildings allows a seamless
integration into the urban setting and maximizes the
property's revenue potential.




On-street Parking
On-street parking provides parking spaces within the
thoroughfare right-of-way. It contributes to the street
environment, helping to buffer pedestrian space from
vehicular traffic. Spaces are distributed evenly along the
street edge, helping to maintain the visual consistency and
appeal of downtown areas.

Structured Parking
Structured parking allows for an efficient use of space
in high density areas. Garages eliminate the need for
extensive surface parking and help maintain a consistent
density within downtown areas. Garages should be
located within block interiors wrapped by perimeter liner
buildings, or as stand alone structures. They should have
facades that reflect proportion, rhythm and massing of
surrounding buildings.
   Recommended Standards


   Parking space dimensions - 9' x 19'

   Maximum ramp slope - 5%
   Minimum Vert. Clearance - 8'2"-10'6"
   Access is provided by mid-block alley




Surface Parking
Landscaping is required to break the visual blight of
large paved areas. Lots should be placed in the rear of
buildings or in block interiors to minimize visual impact.
Trees provide screening and noise reduction to help ease
disruption. Plantings within parking lots also help to reduce
storm water runoff, filter air, provide shade, and maintain
property values.
   Recommended Standards


   Parking space dimensions - 9' x 19'

This document summarizes the process and assumptions used to develop
alternative forecasts for the NC 54 corridor study. This study evaluates several
socioeconomic scenarios along with incremental increases in transportation
system investments for the horizon year 2035. This study's forecasting approach
uses the version TCv4-2008 Triangle Regional Travel Demand Model (TRM)
developed by the Triangle Regional Model Service Bureau. Demand estimates
and performance measures were developed for the purpose of comparing the
relative impacts of the different socioeconomic and transportation system
alternatives. Transportation performance measures were developed for AM and
PM peak periods in addition to the 24-hr daily time period.
The TRM is an advanced four step travel demand model incorporating trip
generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and trip assignment. The modeled
area incorporates both the Durham-Chapel Hill-Carrboro MPO (DCHCMPO) and
the Capital Area MPO (CAMPO). The model was developed using survey data,
2000 Census data, and traffic counts throughout the Triangle Region. An
overview of the model is available in the Research Triangle Region 2035 Long
Range Transportation Plan1, as well as the Triangle Regional Travel Demand
Model User's Guide2. For more detailed information on the model development
and calibration, see the Triangle Regional Model 2006 Documentation3. The
2005 TRM was used as the base year for this study.
The study area being evaluated surrounds NC 54 between US15-501 to the west
and areas along I-40 to the east. In 2005, the study area contained 4,282
households and 3,233 employees. Model results in the study area were

compared to 2005 traffic counts. The model estimates approximately 6.8% more
traffic on NC 54 compared to the counts and approximately 2.5% more traffic on
I-40. This comparison indicated that no adjustments to the model were
necessary. Table 1 below shows characteristics of NC 54 in the study area and
daily performance measures for the 2005 Base year model. In the base year,
over 70% of the vehicle miles of travel (VMT) are comprised of trips traveling
through the study area on NC 54.

As seen in Table 2, the heaviest congestion occurs during the PM peak period
with delay accounting for nearly half of the travel time in the westbound direction.

Future 2035 analysis was based on the evaluation of 4 scenarios designated
Trend Scenario A, Trend Scenario B, Alternative Scenario 1, and Alternative
Scenario 2. The model networks were based on the 2035 Long Range
Transportation Plan (LRTP). For each of the 2035 scenarios, non-motorized trip
percentages were estimated outside the TRM and adjustments were made to the
trip productions and attractions prior to the trip distribution process.

Trend Scenario A

For Trend Scenario A, socioeconomic assumptions are based on historical
trends with minimum to mid-range densities and with land uses as specified in
future land use plans rather than basing assumptions on the LRTP. These
assumptions resulted in 7,751 households and 7,557 employees within the study


                                                                                                        Page 2

area. The transportation network was modified to expand NC 54 to 6 lanes and
include HOV lanes on I-40. This network did not include any improvements to
the collector street network and eliminated the extension of light rail transit (LRT)
through the study area to the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.

In Trend Scenario A, VMT and VHT4 increase by approximately 80% over the
base year as shown in Table 3. With the increase in the number of lanes on NC
54 the travel times and delay, in Table 4, remain roughly the same. For the
entire study area, average daily delay accounts for 31% of total travel time.
Through traffic on NC 54 becomes a smaller percentage of the overall traffic,
accounting for 57% of trips eastbound and 68% of trips westbound; down from
76% eastbound and 72% westbound in the base year.

Table 5 shows the percentage of trips originating from zones in the study area for
each mode of travel represented in the model. With adequate access to transit
services throughout the study area and the availability of HOV lanes on I-40,
transit and carpooling account for 42% of travel in Trend Scenario A.

Trend Scenario B

The same socioeconomic assumptions used for Trend Scenario A were applied
to Trend Scenario B. The transportation network was modified to expand NC 54
to 6 lanes and include HOV lanes on I-40.              This network did include
improvements to the collector street network in the Leigh Village vicinity. This
scenario also did not include the extension of LRT through the study area.

Improvements to the collector street system provide some relief to traffic on NC
54, with daily VMT only 68% more than in 2005 and VHT only 63% more, as
compared to an approximate 80% increase in Trend Scenario A. In Table 7,
travel times and delay are only slightly improved when compared to Trend
Scenario A. Average daily delay accounts for 35% of total travel time in the
study area. Through traffic on NC 54 also makes up a similar percentage of
traffic as seen in Trend Scenario A.

Alternative Scenario 1 ­ LRTP Policy Scenario ­ Light Rail Transit Moderate
Forecast

Socioeconomic assumptions for Alternative Scenario 1 are based on policies
specified in the LRTP. In this scenario, the study area contains an estimated
9,764 households and 15,070 employees. As in the previous scenarios, the
transportation network was modified to expand NC 54 to 6 lanes and include
HOV lanes on I-40. This network also includes improvements to the collector
street system as in Trend Scenario B. In Alternative Scenario 1 the LRT is built
and functioning with stops at Gateway Center, Leigh Village, Meadowmont,
Friday Center, and UNC-Chapel Hill. The Friday Center station includes park-
and-ride access. Additionally, the local Chapel Hill BRT service is extended
along the corridor to Leigh Village.

While the roadway system is the same as Trend Scenario B, the increase in
households and jobs results in an increase over Trend Scenario B in daily VMT
and VHT along NC 54, shown in Table 9 at 74% and 79% respectively when
compared to 2005. As shown in Table 10, travel time and delay on NC 54 are
comparable to Trend Scenario A. For the study area as a whole, delay only
accounts for 28% of travel time; an improvement compared to the previous
scenarios. Through trips, on NC 54, account for 52% of eastbound traffic and
63% of westbound traffic, slightly less than Trend Scenario A.

Alternative Scenario 1 includes the extension of LRT service through the study
area based mainly on specifications included in the LRTP. This alignment
includes station locations that are also served by multiple Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT) and local bus lines. While the speed and frequency of LRT are
competitive when compared to other services, the inclusion of fares does not
enable LRT to compete favorably with BRT which is free. The pricing policies for
transit services affect travel throughout the model region and as such it was not
practical to change the relative pricing of modes in the model for this study. It is
anticipated that if this were done for future analysis of transit in the corridor, LRT
would have a higher percentage of mode share than currently shown in Table 11.
In addition, it is important to note that the mode share of transit is representative
of the entire study area, parts of which do not provide easy walk access/egress
for transit, thus localized shares may be higher.

Further evaluation and adjustments made to the model to enhance walk access
in areas around major transit stations, such as Friday Center which will
incorporate transit oriented development, indicate that mode shares of
approximately 20% can be achieved in adjacent zones. Overall, with LRT and
expanded Chapel Hill bus service, transit shares increase compared to Trend
Scenarios A and B.

Alternative Scenario 2 ­ Transit Focused High-Growth

For Alternative Scenario 2, socioeconomic assumptions are based on
maximizing transit oriented development along the LRT corridor. In this scenario
the study area contains an estimated 16,415 households and 21,261 employees.
In addition to HOV lanes on I-40 as in Alternative Scenario 1, a full interchange
on I-40 was added at Farrington Road. However, NC 54 remains at 4 lanes to the
east of Farrington Road. This network also includes improvements to the
collector street system as in Trend Scenario B. The LRT extension is included
along with expanded BRT service along NC 54 to the east of I-40 as well as BRT
service along US 15-501 to I-40. While the park-and-ride at Friday Center is
removed, three new park-and-ride lots are implemented at Gateway Center,
Leigh Village, and east of the study area near the NC 751 interchange on I-40.

Despite having more jobs and households, with less capacity on NC 54, Table 12
shows that daily VMT is reduced compared to Alternative Scenario 1; VHT on the
other hand increases. Compared to 2005 levels, VMT is 63% higher and VHT is
117% higher. Table 13 shows the increased travel time and delay, compared to
Alternative Scenario 1, which contribute to the higher VHT on NC 54. With
increased congestion, through trips on NC 54 are reduced at 45% eastbound and
53% in the westbound direction. While delay on NC 54 has increased compared
to Alternative Scenario 1, delay for the study area as a whole decreases to 27%
of travel time for Alternative Scenario 2.

While land use in Alternative Scenario 2 was configured to maximize transit
ridership, Table 14 shows a slight decrease in transit share compared to
Alternative Scenario 1. In fact transit trips have increased by more than 1,000
daily trips over Alternative Scenario 1, however at the same time, non-motorized
and auto trips have also increased.

Preferred Scenario

Following the evaluation of the preliminary scenarios by the steering committee,
the study team devised the input assumptions for the Preferred Scenario. The
socioeconomic assumptions are based on a combination of elements from
Alternative Scenarios 1 and 2 and yield 16,059 households and 20,782
employees in the study area. The highway network for the Preferred Scenario
retains the improvements made for Alternative Scenario 1. Turn movement
restrictions were added at intersections along NC 54 consistent with the
"Superstreet"5 intersection concept and to restrict movements across NC 54 at
Farrington Road.

With 6 lanes on NC 54 and jobs and households comparable to Alternative
Scenario 2, the VMT and VHT in Table 15 Table 15: NC 54 Traffic (2035
Preferred Scenario)are higher than the previous scenarios. VMT is 92% higher
and VHT is 142% higher, compared to 2005 levels. However with more capacity
on NC 54, travel time and delay shown in Table 16 are slightly better than
Alternative Scenario 2. Conversely, travel delay for the study area as a whole
increases to 37% of total travel time. While there are more through trips on NC
54 compared to the previous scenarios, they constitute a smaller percentage of
the traffic overall at 38% eastbound and 48 % westbound. In total, through trips
account for 43% of VMT on NC 54.

Transit Comments
      1) Lots of discussion about mode share and why it was low. They asked if we
         tested the sensitivity of the fare for LRT versus free BRT and local bus.
         What change would result from no fare on LRT? I don't think this was
         done, but may be worth bouncing it off Baker to get their observations.
         The sensitivity of LRT to fares was not evaluated as part of this study.
         Besides the inclusion of fares for LRT compared to free BRT, the
         representation of the LRT in terms of the location of stations in the study
         area and frequency of service is comparable to BRT. It is anticipated that
         if no fare were charged for LRT, the LRT would capture a larger share of
         transit trips along its corridor proportionate to the size of the markets being
         served within the Triangle Region.


      2) Need to discuss the insensitivity of the model relative to parking costs and
         constraints as a predictor of travel behavior. They tried to address this in
         the TTA model and supposedly have a new version coming out in
         December to address this issue.

         Like many travel demand models which include a mode choice
         component, park and ride lot costs and zonal parking costs are some of
         the variables used to estimate the cost of using transit relative to other
         modes of transportation. Because mode choice is determined by a
         multitude of socioeconomic, performance and cost variables, parking cost
         alone is not a major factor in determining the usage of transit. For this
         study it was found that zones associated with park and ride lots along the
                                                           NC54-I40 Corridor Study




   LRT corridor did not incur a parking cost however the zones near UNC do
   have an associated parking cost. In addition to parking cost, the model
   assigns terminal times to zones based on parking restrictions. Zones with
   more severe parking restrictions essentially incur a time penalty which
   would make driving to these zones more onerous.


3) Did we have a summary of bus & LRT ridership at the Friday Center?
   Right now we just show LRT and the boardings/alightings are pathetically
   low. Suspicion is there is lots of bus riders not using the LRT due to cost
   and access.
   Currently Baker has only produced a boardings/alightings summary for
   LRT ridership in the study area. We agree with your suspicion that many
   bus riders are not using LRT due to the cost of LRT. The model indicates
   that in 2005 approximately 2,600 transit trips are produced in the study
   area while for the preferred scenario in 2035, there are approximately
   11,100 transit productions.


4) How well does the validated model in the base year match existing bus
   ridership? Baker reports how the base model matches counts on 54 and I-
   40, but it might be useful to know how much it differs from existing
   ridership in the study area.
   The documentation for the Triangle Regional Model development and
   validation prepared in 2006 does not provide any validation statistics for
   transit assignment.


5) How much higher would mode share need to be to keep volumes below
   the threshold for further capacity expansion in Orange County
   (maintaining six lanes)?
   In order to answer this question we would need to determine all the areas
   within the Triangle region which contribute to the traffic on NC 54. We
   could then test different values of mode share for these origins and
   destinations to determine the threshold for capacity expansion.


6) Leta suggested that we look into the model documentation to address how
   the model handles park and ride use. Is it summarized as an auto trip or
   transit trip? In the study area, these really function as long auto trips and


                                                                            Page 2
                                                          NC54-I40 Corridor Study




   short transit trips, unlike most places in the world. How are P&R trips
   captured/summarized in the model? A procedure was developed for the
   current model and this has been documented. She suggested calling the
   service bureau (Joe Huegy).

   The Triangle Regional Model incorporates a unique process that models
   trips where the automobile is used for the main portion of the trip to a
   parking lot near the destination and then a shuttle bus is used to complete
   the journey. These trips are referred to as auto-intercept trips in the
   model. Auto-intercept trips are assigned to both the auto and transit
   networks for their respective portions of the trip. The model separately
   estimates traditional park and ride trips where transit is used for the main
   portion of the trip. Both the auto-intercept trips and traditional park and
   ride trips are included in the transit mode share portion of the mode share
   summary.


7) What does TTC mean in the UNC-TTC table (slide 20)? They were unsure
   what destination/stop that represented for the LRT.
   TTC refers to the Triangle Town Center. UNC-TTC is the name of the
   LRT line used in the model.


8) Same question for Student Union in the boardings summary. That stop
   isn't actually at the Union.
   The stop is coded at the intersection of Manning Dr and Ridge Rd/Skipper
   Bowles Dr. It was named Student Union based on its proximity to the
   Student Union BRT stop.


9) For the VMT slide that 70% of the traffic is passing through the corridor
   today, Mickey Hopkins made a good point that if we draw a one- to two-
   mile radius around the study area and included that in the definition of
   "local" traffic, the 70% would go down dramatically. He wanted us to make
   the case that the improvements we're talking about are not for "outsiders;"
   they are for local people in the nearby vicinity.
   Expanding the definition of local traffic approximately 1 mile to the east
   and 2 miles to the west beyond the study area indicates that external



                                                                           Page 3

traffic would account for 14% of VMT in the eastbound direction and 68%
of VMT in the westbound direction, or 42% of total VMT.

Focus Group Summary
A series of focus group meetings were held with representatives of various community
and interest groups on October 12 and 13, 2009, to identify issues and concerns within
the study corridor, and to guide the development of initial planning materials to be
presented at a public workshop on November 18, 2009. Six groups were identified for
the focus group process: commuters, businesses and developers, neighborhoods and
environmental groups, policymakers, bicycle/pedestrian advocates, and transit
users/advocates. The focus group session for commuters was held at the UNC
Transportation Forum held on October 8, 2009, at the UNC Student Union. A table was
set up in the exhibit/information area of the forum for people to provide comments on the
NC 54 corridor study. During the other stakeholder meetings, separate meetings were
held at the Courtyard by Marriot hotel near the UNC Friday Center on October 12 and
13. The project team also held a meeting with a select group of UNC representatives.

Some comments were recurring across different focus groups. For example, participants
noted the intersection of NC 54 and Farrington Road as a traffic problem in several focus
groups. Another common theme was the need for improved bicycle and pedestrian
facilities and connections along NC 54 and improved local and regional transit service in
the corridor. Opinions varied on the topic of development, with common participant
comments including a desire for high-density development focused around transit stops
and a focus on high-quality design and context-sensitivity. The location of the park-and-
ride lots at the Friday Center was also noted as a contributing factor to congestion in the
corridor in several focus groups--several participants recommended moving the park-
and-ride lots closer to Interstate 40, and possibly providing direct access from the
Interstate to the lots.


Workshop 1 Summary
On November 18, 2009, a public workshop was held at the Friday Center in Chapel Hill
to gather input regarding the overall vision for land use and transportation in the NC 54
corridor. Over 100 people attended the first workshop; 111 signed the attendance sheet
and several more arrived later in the presentation.


NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study Public Involvement Summary   7/8/10                               1
The session began with an informal open house that allowed meeting participants to
review and discuss the information that had been gathered as part of the initial corridor
scan. After a brief introduction to start the formal part of the workshop, members of the
public were invited to participate in the first activity of the evening. Each person was
given three post-it notes on which to write three items that represented their vision for
what the NC 54 corridor should be. These were posted on large boards in the meeting
room, and were organized into broad themes, which were reported back to attendees later
in the workshop. The following broad themes were evident in the vision elements noted
by workshop participants:

   ·   Safety is a major concern of many participants, with a special emphasis on safety
       at intersections and safer access for pedestrians.
   ·   Many participants noted a desire to improve intersections in the corridor,
       particularly those at Farrington Road and Interstate 40.
   ·   There is a desire for the corridor to be multi-modal.
   ·   There is strong interest in light rail transit in the corridor, as well as some interest
       in increased bus service and bus rapid transit (BRT).
   ·   There is strong interest in improved bicycle and pedestrian accessibility in the
       corridor.
   ·   Participants showed interest in decreasing environmental impacts in terms of air,
       water, and noise.
   ·   Many participants noted a desire to preserve green space as a visually-pleasing
       gateway feature and buffer between NC 54 and surrounding neighborhoods.
   ·   Many participants noted a desire for improved traffic flow and less congestion.
       Several ideas were noted for how this might be done, including: increased
       capacity on NC 54, greater connectivity between neighborhood streets, and the
       development of a new road that would connect the US 15-501 and Interstate 40
       corridors south of the NC 54 corridor.
   ·   The greatest degree of disagreement between participants was evident in the land
       use comments. Most comments were generally in favor of more residential
       development in the corridor. Several people would prefer mixed-use
       development, and several more are in favor of high-density development, to
       support transit improvements. However, another group of participants noted a
       preference for low-density development, similar to what is currently there.

The vision exercise was followed by a brief PowerPoint presentation on the activity
completed to date and the goals for the workshop. A second participant exercise
followed the presentation. In this exercise, participants were invited to work together
with the other people sitting at their tables to mark up two maps. One map was marked-
up with a land use and transportation scenario (or scenarios), while the other was marked-
up with general comments, issues, and opportunities. At the end of the exercise, each
table was provided with a sheet on which to record the main ideas discussed at the table
for reporting back to the larger group.

Workshop 2 Summary
On Thursday, February 25, 2010, a second public workshop was held. The purpose of
this workshop was to present information to the public on the land use and transportation
scenarios that had been developed and tested for the corridor, and to collect feedback on
these scenarios, including direction on the development of a preferred land use and
transportation scenario. The meeting was well-attended, with about 120 participants (109
signed-in).

The workshop opened with a brief PowerPoint presentation summarizing the work that
had preceded the meeting, including the results of the first public workshop (held in
November 2009) and the technical work conducted by the consultant team. Workshop
attendees were seated at 15 tables around the room, and each table was provided with a
large blueprint-sized workbook consisting of maps, data tables, questions, and comment
areas. Following the initial background presentation, each table was invited to open up
its workbook and begin on the first exercise of the evening--a review of the three land
use and transportation scenarios that were developed by the consultant team, based on
input from the November workshop.

The three scenarios presented at the workshop consisted of a "trend" scenario and two
potential policy-driven scenarios. The trend scenario (essentially `business-as-usual')
assumed primarily low-density residential growth and traditional roadway capacity-
adding transportation improvements. Scenario 1 assumed a mid-range of increased
development density, a limited amount of redevelopment in some areas, and the provision
of light rail in the corridor, in addition to roadway widening on NC 54. Scenario 2
assumed a higher density of development in the corridor, focused around the light rail
stations, significant redevelopment of several areas, including Glen Lennox and the
Friday Center area, the shift of park and ride facilities to the proposed Leigh Village area,
a new interchange on I-40 to directly serve the new park-and-ride facility, and no
roadway widening on NC 54. The scenarios were developed to be intentionally different,
so the varying aspects of each could be modeled and the performance measures of each
compared and presented at the workshop.

In the workbooks at each table, a map and written description were provided for each of
the three scenarios, and the participants were asked to answer a series of questions
regarding these scenarios. The questions were the same for each scenario, and are listed
below:

   1.   Does this scenario address the visioning issues from Workshop 1?
   2.   How is the land use and development in this scenario?
   3.   How is the density in this scenario?
   4.   Do the transportation improvements fit the scenario?
   5.   Is the growth assumption reasonable?
   6.   What did you like and dislike about the scenario?

The responses recorded at each table are presented in the full report that follows this
summary.


NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study Public Involvement Summary   7/8/10                              3
After spending about 45 minutes going through each of the scenarios individually and
recording comments, there was a brief presentation on the results of the analysis
conducted on the three scenarios. Various performance measures were highlighted in this
presentation, including:

          Traffic volume shift
          Mode split
          Percent delay
          Congested speed
          Jobs and households within ¼ mile of transit stops
          New development in walkable areas
          Light Rail boardings

The workshop participants were invited to fill out a large matrix with comments on the
comparisons between the three scenarios, particularly with regard to the identified
performance measures. The goal of this exercise was to collect information on
participants' preferences with regard to each scenario, to provide guidance in the
development of a preferred scenario for additional testing and refinement. The
participants were also asked to clearly identify those comments that were consensus items
among participants (by recording these in a different color), while still allowing
individual comments to also be recorded.

Focus Group with Business and Developers
In order to test the draft Blueprint concepts in a real-world context, a follow-up focus
group was held with members of the real estate, development, and design community on
May 4, 2010. In addition to detailed questions on elements of the draft Blueprint plan,
suggestions included requiring minimum densities and managed parking structures
around transit stations, using a TIFF for financing infrastructure, concerns about a
realistic mix of residential, retail and office development, and a desire for more specific
details on the proposed NC-54 superstreet improvements.

Workshop 3
On Tuesday, May 11, the NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study project team held the third and final
public involvement workshop and presented the preferred scenario. Attendance at the
meeting showed the public continued to be interested; 71 people signed the sign-in sheet
and several more joined the workshop later. The presentation including a quick summary
of the background and past events of the project and then went into detail about the
preferred scenario. The scenario included land use designations, transit centers, bicycle
and pedestrian improvements, and a "superstreet concept" for NC-54.

The project team focused the workshop participants on various aspects of the scenario,
starting with the land use, moving to the transit-oriented development phasing example,
followed by transit, bicycle and pedestrian, and connectivity changes and improvements,
and ending with the new "superstreet" concept. Following the conclusion of Workshop 3,
participants were encouraged to complete a Comment Sheet, which included eight

statements about the land use, transit, bicycle and pedestrian, and roadway improvements
presented in the preferred scenario. Participants scaled their level of agreement with the
statements, which helped the project team assess the public's opinion about various
elements of the preferred scenario. The workshop participants were also encouraged to
submit their comments in response to the elements in the preferred scenario. The range of
comments was then used to refine the Blueprint Master Plan.

Public Workshop # 1 Summary                                                 12/16/09

       corridor.
   ·   The greatest degree of disagreement between participants was evident in the land use
       comments. Most comments were generally in favor of more residential development in
       the corridor. Several people would prefer mixed-use development, and several more are
       in favor of high-density development, to support transit improvements. However,
       another group of participants noted a preference for low-density development, similar to
       what is currently there.

The vision exercise was followed by a brief PowerPoint presentation on the activity completed to
date and the goals for the workshop. A second participant exercise followed the presentation.
In this exercise, participants were invited to work together with the other people sitting at their
tables to mark up two maps. One map was marked-up with a land use and transportation
scenario (or scenarios), while the other was marked-up with general comments, issues, and
opportunities. At the end of the exercise, each table was provided with a sheet on which to
record the main ideas discussed (and largely agreed to) at each table for reporting back to the
larger group. The table below shows the priority comment summary presented by each table.
The section after the table shows complete comments from each table (summary presentation
and comments made on maps).

Table 8    ·   Create outer loop from Jack Bennett Road to I-40
           ·   Run rail along NC 54 ­ rail is essential
           ·   Preserve NC 54 and Farrington's full access
           ·   Consider sound barriers for residential areas along NC 54
           ·   Consider 4 lanes for NC 54 from I-40 to 751
Table 9    ·   Build out George King Road to NC 54 before projected housing build. Do not
               collapse Meadowmont Lane and Barbee Chapel Road intersections (as was
               done to Farrington Road).
           ·   Move transit station closer to Farrington Road/I-40 for ingress/egress to I-40.
               This makes access easier to a park and ride at I-40/NC 54.
           ·   Make transit line parallel to NC 54 to gain economies of scale in bridge system
               over creek and Corps land on the way to Meadowmont station
           ·   Connect bike/ped trails between the neighborhoods: the Oaks, Meadowmont,
               Downing Creek, Falconbridge
Table 10   ·   Reduce number of cars on NC 54 with a park and ride lot closer to I-40 ­ have
               commuters exit off I-40 straight into the lot. This lot can also be a
               commercial/housing center as well.
           ·   Need 0.6 miles of pedestrian/bicycle crossing over the wetland
           ·   NC 54 as a "complete street" from at least Meadowmont to 15-501 (unclear

           ·   Developers should pay for redirecting traffic, or development should be
               contingent on them to fund this
           ·   Some additional bike/ped paths
Table 12   ·   Preserve and protect Eastwood Park as a residential neighborhood. Add
               landscaping/walls/berms/whatever to isolate the neighborhood from NC 54.
           ·   Move the drainage ditch from between Celeste Circle and the NC 54 service
               road to the other side of NC 54

           ·   Make NC 54 bike/ped friendly
           ·   Locate park and ride lot outside of the corridor (e.g. near 751 and I-40)
           ·   "Do not block intersection" sign eastbound on NC 54 at Huntingridge Road
           ·   Double-T intersection at Crossland/Huntingridge Road
Table 13   ·   Try to get traffic off NC 54 instead of accommodating it on NC 54
           ·   Dense development near transit nodes: employment closer to the university,
               residential further out
           ·   Take Carolina North into consideration ­ make sure it is rail/transit accessible
           ·   No new interchange at Farrington Road ­ maintain low density residential
               there. Keep in mind that neighborhood is environmentally sensitive, historic,
               area where change is not anticipated (LDR), Creekside School, interchanges
               are points of congestion, transit node moved to south
           ·   Continuous bike lanes along NC 54 and a north-south connection
           ·   Usable green spaces by Leigh Farm Park, with some noise abatement

NC 54 Workshop 1 Summary                 12-18-09                                     4
- Bypass from Southern Village to 751 on Fayetteville Road.
Issues and Opportunities Map
- New exit ramp to I-40 from Farrington Road.
- Widen NC-54 (east of I-40) from two lanes.
- Widen NC-54, just off of I-40 exit. Need to double.
- The existing NC-54 bridge over I-40 should be widened.
- On southern end of study area, need a new east-west connector between 15-501 and I-40 and
between I-40 and 751. Barbee Chapel Road can be improved to divert traffic from NC-54 to 751.
- fix map: NC-54 at Barbee Chapel is prone to accidents and should be included in the
"High Crash Areas" circle.
- Transit Station 1 is a potential center of new employment and should be a top priority.
Workshop Basemap
- The collector plan is not considered in the Pedestrian Facilities Map. We've identified where
there should be bike/ped lanes. Bike/ped along Farrington Road and NC-54. The bike/ped lane
along Farrington Road should be safe enough for elementary students.
- Need a bike/ped bridge across I-40 to Farrington Road.
- At Transit Station 1, consider having a bicycle parking facility.
- Along NC-54, provide wheelchair access to cross over NC-54 in several places.

- Add trails in the floodplain to connect Downing Creek and Falconbridge neighborhoods.
- Alternate more-southern route from Chatham to RTP.

Table #4 Main Points
- Connect neighborhoods to reduce traffic.
- Relocate UNC Hospital to I-40/NC-54 intersection (near Transit Station 1).
- Expand and complete network of off-road greenways and bike paths from "inner" NC-54
out to I-40.
- Build southern east/west connector road to funnel Chatham traffic to I-40 ­ somewhere
south of this project's study area.
Issues and Opportunities Map
- High density, mixed-use development on either side of 15-501 at Willow Drive (near Estes and
Ephesus Church Road).
- Need several transit bus stops along NC-54, from I-40 to 15-501.
- Redevelop the Quadrangle complex to a park and ride garage.
- Pedestrian/Bike Bridge or sidewalk across wetlands along NC-54 east of I-40.
- Bike/Ped bath along outside of Phase Opportunities 2, 3, and 4; connecting to Barbee Chapel
Road and NC-54.
- New Road from 15-501/Mason Farm down south (as an East-West corridor) that connects 15-
501 to I-40.
- In Phase Opportunity 1, HC with VCH and VCL development on the edges and a park on the
southwest end. Move hospital from campus.
- In Phase Opportunity 2, have a park on the east end and HC on the southern end bordering NC-
54 and Barbee Chapel Road.
Workshop Basemap
- At Transit Station 1, inner circle is UNC Hospital; in outer circle, the development north of
Celeste Circle neighborhood is VCH.
- At Transit Station 2, inner circle is VCH, outer circle has one area of HC and one area at the
Barbee Chapel and NC-54 intersection is VCL.
- Along NC-54, time lights both ways.
- At Burning Tree/Finley Golf Course and NC-54 and at Hamilton and NC-54, have a 4-way stop
intersection, with "no right turn on red" to facilitate heave bike/ped traffic.
- Close Farrington Road.
- Make the bus stop at Celeste Circle a "real" place to wait for the bus.
- Local bus along NC-54.
- New tunnel below NC-54 east of Barbee Chapel.
- Roundabout at NC-54 and Barbee Chapel intersection.

Table #5 Main Points
- Increase road Capacity and add access points (an exit off I-40 to Ephesus Church Road,
Change Barbee Chapel Road to 4 lanes to take traffic off NC-54 heading into Chapel Hill).
- Develop east side (Farrington Road side) of NC-54 with low density.
- Use express bus instead of rail. When relocating stops, use existing roads, don't build new
tracks.
- Improve pedestrian/bike safety, perhaps by adding a lane?

NC 54 Workshop 1 Summary                12-18-09                                       6
- Development close to UNC campus should be more mixed-use.
Issues and Opportunities
- The traffic on Farrington is due to huge development in Chatham County. They must be linked
to I-40 to cut down on traffic.
- Additional interchange off I-40 at Farrington Road intersection.
- Co-locate shopping, dining, and park and ride north of the I-40 exit (exit 273B).
- Need 2 left turn lanes at NC-54 and Farrington.
- Extra merge lane off I-40 onto NC-54.
- Remove median on NC-54.
- Synchronized stop lights on NC-54.
- Reversible lane ability.
- Do not expand Meadowmont lane.
- NC-54 is 6 lanes at Meadowmont. Maybe make it 6 lanes from I-40 and use "lane change"
arrows to help steady flow of traffic from UNC workers and on UNC game days. Incorporate
bike/ped lanes.
- No rail. It would bring more people in and make NC-54 more congested. We do not need more
density and ruined greenways with a train. Aesthetically unpleasing.
- Over the road pedestrian bride across NC-54 at Hamilton. School children and Glenwood
shoppers cross this 6-lane road and it is very dangerous.
- To access 15-501, additional north/south exit lanes.
Workshop Basemap
- BRT along NC-54
- Bus station and park and ride lot on the east side of the I-40 exit ramp, to divert traffic away
from Farrington side of I-40.
- Transit station 1 is considered not possible as an express bus stop.
- There should be a connection from Chatham County to I-40.
- Solar housing is good at the acreage near Stagecoach and Farrington.
- Need a stoplight at Barbee Chapel and Stagecoach.
- Pedestrian bridge across NC-54 near Glen Lennox.
- At Transit Station 2, expand current VCH. This stop is a possible priority bus stop.

Table #6 Main Points
- Separate bike lanes from traffic lanes on NC-54 and connect the bike lanes to
Meadowmont and beyond.
- HOV/Express bus lanes added to NC-54 and I-40.
- Village Center High Density around Transit in ¼ mile ­ Village Center Low Density in ½
mile
- Hospital Center near golf course transit stop.
- Town Center near elementary school/15-501 and NC-54.
- Park and ride garages right off I-40.
- More bike racks on buses and trains and connect bike lanes to transit stops.
- If increase road capacity, then transit will be less likely.
Issues and Opportunities Map
- Bike lane along NC-54, 751, Barbee Chapel (to Southpoint), through Meadowmont, up to
Easttowne.
- Rapid bus lanes/Commuter bus lanes along NC-54 and to Cary
- Add HOV lanes on NC-54, each way.

NC 54 Workshop 1 Summary                  12-18-09                                           7
Workshop Basemap
- More bike capacity on bus and rail.
- Better bus connection from Chapel Hill transit to Durham, Cary, and Raleigh.
- Bike lane along Farrington Road (south of I-540 and NC-54) to Amberly.
- Bus route along Farrington Road (south of I-540 and NC-54) to Amberly.
- Bike lanes down NC-54.
- Connected bike route along Barbee Chapel, through Meadowmont, to Ephesus Church Road
and Easttowne.
- Bus lanes and HOV lanes, inbound and outbound, a
- HOV lanes and priority bus lanes on I-40.
- Along NC-54, traffic too heavy for WOL, need separated bike lane.
- No interchange at the Farrington Road and I-40 intersection (north of NC-54).
- Park and Ride lot at Ephesus Church Road and Farrington Road, with a dedicated bus route
taking commuters down George King Road.
- Park and Ride lot at Celeste Circle neighborhood.
- Neighborhood at the Barbee Chapel and NC-54 intersection is marked VRL.
- Glen Lennox neighborhood is marked TC.
- At Transit Station 1, inner circle is VCH, outer circle is VCL.
- At Transit Station 2, inner circle is HC.
- At Transit Station 3, inner circle is VCH.

Table #7 Main Points
- Density and mixed used at transit stops.
- Create neighborhoods and employment centers ­ places rather than stops.
- Hospital Campus at the Friday Center and Barbee Chapel Road.
- More East 54-type development at NC-54/15-501 Bypass.
- Develop SW Durham Parkway/George King Rd.
Issues and Opportunities Map
- Extend rail down I-40 to Triangle Metro Center.
Workshop Basemap
No comments on map, everything was colored and labeled.

Table #8 Main Points
- Create outerloop from Jack Bennett Road to I-40.
- Run rail along NC-54 ­ rail is essential.
- Preserve NC-54 and Farrington's full access.
- Consider sound barriers for residential areas along NC-54.
- Consider 4 lanes for NC-54 from I-40 to 751.
Issues and Opportunities
- Need 751 to 15-501 loop north and south of NC-54. This outer loop will take congestion off of
I-40, NC-54, and 15-501. The more cars coming from Pittsboro and Raleigh that use the outer
loop, the less on NC-54 and 15-501.
- Preserve full access at I-40/NC-54 intersection. Do other things to address congestion.
- Support transit, but consider transit impacts on NC-54.
- Near Transit Stations 2 and 3, have sound barriers for residential areas?



NC 54 Workshop 1 Summary                12-18-09                                       8
Workshop Basemap
- Transit line should follow NC-54 and I-40, not go through residential property that has already
been established.
- School should preclude congested transit.

Table #9 Main Points
- Build out George King Road to NC-54 before projected housing build. Do not collapse
Meadowmont Lane and Barbee Chapel Road intersections (as was done to Farrington
Road).
- Move transit station closer to Farrington Road/I-40 for ingress/egress to I-40. This makes
access easier to a park and ride at I-40/NC-54.
- Make transit line parallel to NC-54 to gain economies of scale, in bridge system over creek
and Corps land on the way to Meadowmont station.
- Connect bike/ped trails between the neighborhoods: the Oaks/Meadowmont/Downing
Creek/Falconbridge.
Issues and Opportunities Map
- Bus shelter needed on both sides of NC-54 near Celeste Circle neighborhood.
- Need bike/ped path connecting Downing Creek and Falconbridge neighborhoods and
eventually connect bike path along NC-54 across I-40 to the American Tobacco Trail. This path
would easily and safely create a whole bike network. Existing bike/ped tunnel allows connect for
all of Falconbridge and Meadowmont if connection across wetlands is fixed.
- Planned rail corridor is in a terrible place. Should renegotiate with core folks to put rail
easement along NC-54. Reasons are as stands: 1. economy of scale of building over creek, 2.
access over creek as NC-54 develops, and 3. closer to NC-54 for easier park and ride access.
System should come down Farrington Road to NC-54.
- Preserve Glen Lennox.

Table #10 Main Points
- Reduce number of cars on NC-54 with a park and ride lot closer to I-40 ­ have
commuters exit off I-40 straight into the lot. This lot can also be a commercial/housing
center as well.
- Need 0.6 miles of pedestrian/bike crossing over the wetland.
- NC-54 as a "complete street" from at least Meadowmont to 15-501 (unclear step down I-
40 to Medowmont).
- Protect the ability of residents of north neighborhoods to get through.
- Fix the I-40/NC-54 intersection.
- Need bike/ped crossing over NC-54 near Farrington Road.
- Need bus stops at the rusty signs on NC-54 at Falconbridge.
Issues and Opportunities Map
- At Creekside School, traffic safety capacity.
- Disagree on: staging transit vs. no public transit and pay for improvements vs. no
combined governments (Durham and Chapel Hill).
- Water problem in the floodplain area north of NC-54.
Workshop Basemap
- Crosswalk-bridge across NC-54 by Celeste Circle neighborhood and by Glen Lennox.
- Bike/ped path alongside NC-54.
- Keep NC-54 light.
NC 54 Workshop 1 Summary                 12-18-09                                        9
- Boulevard quality bridge across NC-54 by Glen Lennox ­ wide sidewalks or "Long Bridge"
(shops along overpass).

Table #11 Main Points
- Traffic through corridor is mainly off map.
- Alternate route from 15-501 to I-540 and RTP besides NC-54.
- Connect roads through area for locals, so they can avoid NC-54.
- Light rail is in the wrong place. It should go to Raleigh/RTP to relieve congestion.
- Funnel I-40 traffic off NC-54 using extra lanes, maybe toll roads, and clover leaf
intersection.
- Developers should pay for redirecting traffic, or development should be contingent on
them to fund this.
- Some additional bike/ped paths.
Issues and Opportunities
- Study should be expanding to Garrett Road/751.
- Need safe bike/ped crossing on I-40.
- Cloverleaf intersection at I-40 and NC-54.
- Farrington Road and NC-54 must be a grade-separated interchange.
- Park and ride lot off I-40 near Farrington.
- Express frontage roads to/from I-40.
- Bikes and sidewalks along NC-54.
- Grade separated bike/ped paths across NC-54 (bridge or tunnel) at various places.
- Reduce congestion by route to RTP to I-540
- Make the connection between Farrington Road and Barbee Chapel Road.
- Road improvement on Stagecoach Road and Barbee Chapel Road.
Workshop Basemap
- No left turn lane on I-40 exit ramp.
- Jordan Lake/Colvard Farms needs to pay for NC-54 improvements to mitigate their traffic
impact.
- Need traffic signal at Farrington and Stagecoach and Farrington and Barbee Chapel and
Farrington Mill Road.
- Light rail wrong route to RTP and Raleigh. Relieve traffic.
- Take watershed into development plan.
- Development should pay for any road expansion.
- No further development until alternate roads/paths are done. Then, have low density with green
space.

Table #12 Main Points
- Preserve and protect Eastwood Park as a residential neighborhood. Add
landscaping/walls/berms/whatever to isolate the neighborhood from NC-54.
- Move the drainage ditch from between Celeste Circle and the NC-54 service road to the
other side of NC-54.
- Complete SW Durham Drive through Meadowmont Lane.
- Make NC-54 bike/ped friendly.
- Locate park and ride lot outside of the corridor (e.g., near 751 and I-40).
- "Do not block intersection" sign eastbound on NC-54 at Huntingridge Road.
- Double-T intersection at Crossland/Huntingridge Road.

Issues and Opportunities Map
- Move Friday Center park and ride lot somewhere else, for example, on 751 near I-40.
- Need more frequent TTA buses, especially around lunch.
- Rail stations are good.
- Add a "Do Not Block Intersection" sign at the exit-bound lane of Huntingridge Road and NC-
54.
Workshop Basemap
- The tunnel under NC-54 is great. Need more ways like that to cross NC-54.
- Keep Celeste Circle neighborhood residential.
- At Transit Station 1, mixed use is ok in inner circle, mostly near I-40 and the transit center.
- Put in I-40/Farrington Road interchange and have a UNC park and ride.
- Do make the SW Durham Drive connection.
- Need to make NC-54 pedestrian/bike friendly.
- Protect Eastwood Park. Between the service road and NC-54, put vegetation/walls/earth beams
to isolate Eastwood Park from NC-54. Close access between light at Huntingridge and the
service road, making a T-intersection. The collector street plan calls for a nearby intersection of
Crossland Drive with NC-54. This intersection will forms a "Double-T" intersection which, with
lights timed appropriately, functions as a single light.
- The Farrington Mall parking lot drainage goes under NC-54 to a ditch between Celeste Circle
and NC-54 service road. The volume of running water and mosquitoes are dangerous. It is a
failed engineering project. A modern storm drainage system is needed, preferably on the
Farrington Road side of NC-54.
- Need a bus shelter at the bus stop in front of Celeste Circle.
- Need an "outer loop" to connect 15-501 with I-40.

Table #13 Main Points
- Try to get traffic off NC-54 instead of accommodating it on NC-54.
- Dense development near transit nodes: employment closer to University, residential
further out.
- Take Carolina North into consideration ­ make sure it is rail/transit accessible.
- No new interchange at Farrington Road ­ maintain low density residential there. Keep in
mind that neighborhood is environmentally sensitive, historic, area where change is not
anticipated (LDR), Creekside School, interchanges are points of congestion, transit node
moved to south.
- Continuous bike lanes along NC-54 and a north-south connection.
- Usable green spaces by Leigh Farm Park, with some noise abatement.
- Accommodate Chatham County development and commuter traffic.
Issues and Opportunities
- Re-route I-40 between Raleigh and Greensboro, bypassing the Triangle to the south.
- No interchange at I-40 and Farrington Road.
- Noise abatement wall for Leigh Farm and residents.
- Along NC-54, bike lane/green way.
- At I-40/NC-54 interchange, improve exit flow.
- Outside of Transit Station 1, maintain low-density.
- Along NC-54, need safe pedestrian crossing facilities.
- Pave George King Road and make it a viable artery.
- Need a southern connection between 15-501 and 751 to ease pressure off NC-54.
- Take into account Chatham County development.

Workshop Basemap
- Along NC-54, bike lane.
- White parcels of areas of potential change east of I-40 and way north of NC-54 will not change
because it is owned by Durham County, not town of Chapel Hill.
- Along Farrington Road, maintain low density residential.
- Noise abatement wall for Leigh Farm.
- Have some sort of north-south bike connection along Farrington Road, to Meadowmont.

The majority were additional follow-up comments from focus group Invitees and public
workshop participants, although several were from people who were nota able o attend the
workshop.


Traffic Issues
I-40/NC-54/Farrington Road intersection:
-   The left hand turn problem from westbound NC-54 into southbound Farrington Road
    remains, in my mind, the most difficult situation to resolve. Diverting some of that traffic
    elsewhere seems to be an absolute imperative. Some traffic coming off of I-40 cannot find a
    space in the left hand lane and is coming down to the traffic light at Huntingridge Road and
    making a 180-degree turn to get back to Farrington Road.
-   Difficulty with left hand turn onto Falconbridge Road from westbound NC-54 during rush
    hours (eastbound traffic is backed up and blocks the lane despite DO NOT BLOCK
    INTERSECTION signs.)
-   Much concern about possible increase in cut through traffic onto Huntingridge Road due to
    backup problems on NC-54. At present this mostly occurs during rush hours but can occur
    at other times due to congestion on NC-54.
-   What do the I-40 / NC-751, I-40 / 15-501, I-40 / NC-86 interchanges look like during rush
    times? Could there be ways to make these interchanges more appealing that would take
    pressure off the NC-54 situation? One thing that differentiates the NC-54 interchange from I-
    40 west bound when compared to 751, 15-501, and 86 is that 54 is the only without a traffic
    light bounded left turn at the end of the exit ramp. Comparing 54 to 15-501, during non-
    traffic times, 54 seems like a faster drive to UNC than 15-501 when starting from their
    respective exit ramps. Obviously, the most important question is, where is everyone taking
    their cars such that slow downs and unsafe situations are being caused by back-ups. For
    example, if many of them are going to the Friday Center to park and ride to UNC then
    working with the 751 route (via Stage Coach and Barbee Chapel) to the Friday Center would
    likely be more helpful than others.
-   Adding lanes and an interchange at Farrington Rd. would only funnel more traffic to the
    already abysmally dysfunctional intersection of Farrington Rd., NC 54 and I-40.
    Interchanges CREATE slowdowns and congestion; they do not relieve them. Open stretches
    of interstate highway allow for free flowing traffic; interchanges gum up the works. There is
    a logical reason why federal guidelines stipulate that interchanges should be 2 miles apart;
    that principle is violated here. Interchanges also bring tremendous pressure for dense, intense
    land use changes...simply not appropriate along this low-density residential portion
    of Farrington Rd. That decision was affirmed by the removal of a transit stop from the area
    (near Creekside School).
-   Creekside School would be negatively impacted by the congestion accompanying an
    interchange.
-   Pressure for an interchange is coming from Chapel Hill; Durham needs to say no to the
    continual push of development and congestion out of Chapel Hill and into SW Durham.
NC 54 Workshop 1 Summary                 12-18-09                                        13
    That process began by pushing Chapel Hill's outer belt loop, the Laurel Hill Parkway, from
    Sage Rd. to Pope Rd. to Farrington Rd. in an ever eastward progression. The name is now
    Southwest Durham Drive!
-   While at first blush, an I-40 interchange at Farrington Road might seem like a good idea,
    upon appropriate examination, the negative consequences of such an interchange will again
    be realized. Last year such a proposal was put before the Transportation Advisory
    Committee. It was removed from ANY further consideration. An interchange at I-40 and
    Farrington Road would put our children at risk, threaten the historic Leigh Farm and
    environmentally sensitive Water Fowl Federal Lands, and violate the graves of those laid to
    rest at Markham Memorial Gardens cemetery.
-   Specific land uses in the vicinity of Farrington and I-40 include the Prescott Place, Glenview
    Park and Trenton neighborhoods, the Markham Memorial Gardens cemetery and Leigh
    Farm Park, 86 acres of open space protected over the last 20 years by a public private
    partnership including the Jr. League of Durham and Orange Counties, Triangle Land
    Conservancy, the State Dept. of Cultural and Natural Resources, DUTAG, DOST, Historic
    Preservation of Durham, Durham Parks and Rec, SEEDS and Piedmont Wildlife. There
    is literally no room for an interchange without destroying something of great value (homes,
    graves, park land).
-   Farrington Rd. is a low-density residential greenbelt with 5 sites on the Durham Inventory of
    Cultural and Natural Resources. Leigh Farm Park in particular is a gem of open space
    and anchor to the New Hope Creek Corridor trail system. It should be protected, not
    drowned in asphalt and congestion.
-   As the director of Piedmont Wildlife Center, a nonprofit that actively uses Leigh Farm Park
    to teach children and adults the importance of protecting wildlife and our natural resources, I
    believe that Leigh Farm Park and the surrounding New Hope Creek watershed would be
    severely damaged by any increase in traffic brought on by an interchange at Farrington Road
    and I-40. The wetlands in Leigh Farm Park are already being damaged by runoff from I-40
    and any additional impact could kill the wildlife and plants that protect our watershed.
    Please fight to protect the future of our environment!
-   I live in the Trenton neighborhood. Several residents have been very vocal in their
    opposition to an interchange at I-40 and Farrington Road. I am not one of them. I would
    welcome easy access to I-40, and the ability to avoid the very busy and sometimes
    dangerous intersection at Farrington and 54.
Increased Congestion:
-   Concerns about increased congestion from possible UNC medical facilities going into two
    buildings recently vacated on NW corner of NC-54 and Farrington Road. Egress from that
    site onto Farrington Road very difficult because entrance is only 30 to 40 feet from NC-54.
Other Traffic Issues:
-   Is there a plan for a crossover at Hwy 54/Hamilton due to 54 East/Walking Traffic/schools?
-   George King Road is re-routed to make a T-junction with NC54 via Crossland Drive, which
    is in our neighborhood. The Leigh Village map proposes to seal off and thus prevent access
    of our neighborhood to NC54 via the light at Huntingridge Road which leads from NC54
    into the Falconbridge neighborhood. Thus, remaining would be a "double T" arrangement
    of George King and Huntingridge Roads which the developer thought were close enough so
    that the signals would be timed so that they functioned as a single light. Importantly also,
NC 54 Workshop 1 Summary                 12-18-09                                        14
    the Service Road and Celeste Circle access to NC54 would be via Leigh Village. To exit our
    neighborhood we would have to drive into Leigh Village and circle around to get to NC54.
    The neighbors that I have spoken with like this plan. It would make commercial
    development on the Service Road and Celeste Circle unattractive since access to NC54
    would be inconvenient and there would be more plantings between the Service Road and
    NC54 which would make our neighborhood less visible.
-   George King Rd. should be paved and the Meadowmont Connector built as planned.
-   A Southern connector joining 15-501 and 751 should be investigated as an alternative
    route to help relieve congestion on NC 54.
-   Another concept to investigate: Existing I-40 could become business I-40 (as with I-85
    in Greensboro and I-40 in Winston-Salem) with a new I-40 bypassing the Triangle to the
    south.
Alternative Transportation
-   Funding for transit may never materialize; exploding densities (based on the presupposition
    of transit corridors) could be a serious mistake, destroying the very character that makes
    North Carolina more attractive than New Jersey.
-   The issue of a lack of good public transportation along the corridor was raised. Whether our
    residents in significant numbers would use it is questionable.
-   Epcon senior citizen neighborhood is in full-swing (wrt construction), and these residents
    should have public transport as well. Stats show that with increase in age (past retirement)
    comes an increase in automobile accident incidents, and many older people no longer have a
    valid driver's license.
Public Bus Stops:
-   3 separate comments about getting a Durham public bus stop within walking distance of
    Creekside Elementary, as well as the Epcon Senior Citizen Neighborhood:
          1. Creekside Elementary currently is the only school (of which we are aware) that
             has no public bus stop within walking distance. Creekside is a beautifully diverse
             school, in terms of ethnicity and socio-economics, but this comes with its
             challenges. I have been involved in the School Improvement Plan, and the great
             disparity between low income students and mid-high income students was a
             subject of most serious concern. We have a tremendous number of bus riders, a
             large number of whose parents do not have personal transportation. This hinders
             their involvement and our ability to provide services/workshops/etc. for them at
             Creekside. At the very least, these low income families need reliable
             transportation outside of school bus hours in order to participate fully in the
             programs available to them at the school. Lack of public transport was also seen
             as an impediment to the involvement of 'Families and Community,' which is a
             goal upon which Creekside and all schools are judged. The fact that public bus
             transportation does not extend to Creekside was seen as the biggest problem with
             engaging the community and the parents.
          2. Any after-school (or before-school activities) must necessarily involve private
             transportation -- adding to traffic in this area. The lack of public transportation
             serving our school's area limits family and community involvement at our
             school. The bus stop would enable parents to come to school for parent-teacher
NC 54 Workshop 1 Summary                12-18-09                                        15
               conferences, math/literacy nights, family socials, PTA meetings, movie nights,
               etc.
           3. I have contacted the Durham school board about this, and have been told they
              would support a public bus stop here. However, the city has not been as
              encouraging. It would help if you all recommended to the city that a public bus
              stop be put in this area to facilitate school transportation (particularly
              extracurricular transportation), and possible connection to public transport to
              Chapel Hill from Durham. If you could also involve the Durham Public School
              Board, that would help too!
Strong interest in biking, but safety is a concern:
-   I live in Southern Village on the southern part of Chapel Hill and work in RTP. I love to
    cycle but have to extend my cycling path to commute to work via Stage Couch Rd, Massey
    Chapel, etc. as the 54 corridor is not negotiable safely. That extends my bicycle commute to
    ~75min one way which would likely be ~55min if I could safely go straight on 54.
-   In my opinion an express bus or rail system to RTP as a center of gravity for employment
    would already reduce contention on this corridor significantly.
-   Though I strongly lobby for off-road bike paths the impact to contention during rush hour
    will likely be limited. Other alternatives will need to consider alternative corridors going in
    parallel. Further widening of the current road falls short of increasing capacity as the
    intersections are and stay the bottleneck. Even with 4 lanes on 54 most people will have to
    turn right onto I-40 and thus funnel into one lane which will continue to gate the capacity. If
    higher vehicle capacity along this direction is required it will require alternative corridors
    connecting to I-40 further south/east in parallel to 54. Hopefully that can be avoided by
    improvement in public transportation and connections of bike and pedestrian facilities to
    enable people to get to bus and rail stops.
-   I am concerned about 54 as one of the few routes between Chapel Hill and Durham which is
    extremely unfriendly to cyclists. The narrow section through the wetland has no shoulder
    and steep banks on either side. Riders have been pushed off the road and down the
    embankment through the blackberry bushes. One concept program that has the right idea is
    the complete streets program. The link is: http://www.completestreets.org/resources/new-
    pedestrian-safety-ranking-calls-for-complete-streets/.
-   From my perspective, equal safe access for all modes of travel is a civil rights issue, just like
    the Americans with Disabilities act requires public ways and buildings be handicapped
    accessible, shopping centers, post offices, banks, government centers, churches, etc all need
    to be accessible by walking or bike, too. Pedestrians and cyclists are essentially fenced in by
    uncrossable highways. Whole most peds and cyclists travel locally, some do want to go to
    Durham. There are not any comfortable ways of getting there. While crossing Estes Drive
    during dusk, inside a crosswalk and with a crossing light, this commenter was almost hit by
    a car whose driver did not see her ­ and this has happened several times. Each time, she
    reports to the town of Chapel Hill that something needs to be done to improve safety. I have
    written to the town traffic people suggesting more light at this intersection, to paint the
    crosswalks solid white so a body silhouette is visible to drivers at dusk, and that there be
    rumple strips place a few seconds on approach to any crosswalk to alert the driver physically
    that a crosswalk is ahead.
Development Issues

NC 54 Workshop 1 Summary                  12-18-09                                         16
-   Eastwood Park neighborhood would like to avoid commercial development in their
    neighborhood and protect it from the hostile environment of NC-54 through the use of
    landscaping and vegetative/earth barriers. The proposed Leigh Village development shows a
    good way to incorporate commercial development while leaving the Eastwood Park
    neighborhood residential.
-   To blame the UNC park and ride lots for the traffic on Highway 54 ignores the development
    along the corridor, the fact that housing in Chapel Hill has become less and less available for
    people who work in the Town and therefore have to travel to work, and the fact that more
    businesses are there now than in the past. It is unfortunate that the focus group organizers
    did not invite UNC representatives to come to the meetings with, for example developers, so
    that this could be clarified. The UNC park and ride lots are just one of many reasons for the
    high traffic counts on the highway, and on a given day make up a small percentage of the
    total traffic on the roadway.
-   The development of Carolina North must be taken into account when studying future traffic
    needs in this area.
Other Issues
-   Farrington Rd. is a low-density residential greenbelt with 5 sites on the Durham Inventory of
    Cultural and Natural Resources. Leigh Farm Park in particular is a gem of open space
    and anchor to the New Hope Creek Corridor trail system. Preservation, not more pavement,
    is our watchword.
-   When a small turn in lane was added for eastbound traffic to turn into Huntingridge Road
    they made it very sharp so they did not have to move existing storm drain. This is a problem
    for many of our residents.
-   Speed limit should be enforced. On the 54 corridor described, it goes through a wetland, so
    any expansion of the road immediately presents water displacement issues for the
    surrounding buildings. For this reason, the only way to add is to build a long bridge. If you
    do build a bike-ped path, make it far enough away so the traffic noise doesn't make the
    cyclists deaf. I am convinced that my husband's hearing issues are from years of traffic noise
    as he ran or biked on the street. I measured the traffic noise beside 15-501 to be over 80 dB
    with my sound meter.
-   I am confused and concerned that all of the scheduled workshops are in Orange Co. and the
    majority of the proposed activity and destruction is in Durham Co. for the benefit of the
    people that live or commute to Orange Co.. Why are Durham residents being excluded or at
    least inconvenienced by you holding all workshops in Chapel Hill/Orange Co.? I also
    understand Carrboro has declared hands off and they will not be part of a "regional solution"
    to problems created by their continued lack of infrastructure improvements.

NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study: Public Workshop 2 Comments                      3/05/10

Executive Summary
On Thursday, February 25, 2010, a second public workshop was held for the NC
54/Interstate 40 Corridor Study. The purpose of this workshop was to present
information to the public on the land use and transportation scenarios that had
been developed and tested for the corridor, and to collect feedback on these
scenarios, including direction on the development of a preferred land use and
transportation scenario. The meeting was well-attended, with about 120
participants (109 signed-in).

The workshop opened with a brief PowerPoint presentation summarizing the
work that had preceded the meeting, including the results of the first public
workshop (held in November 2009) and the technical work conducted by the
consultant team. Workshop attendees were seated at 15 tables around the
room, and each table was provided with a large blueprint-sized workbook
consisting of maps, data tables, questions, and comment areas. Following the
initial background presentation, each table was invited to open up its workbook
and begin on the first exercise of the evening--a review of the three land use and
transportation scenarios that were developed by the consultant team, based on
input from the November workshop.

The three scenarios presented at the workshop consisted of a "trend" scenario
and two potential policy-driven scenarios. The trend scenario (essentially
`business-as-usual') assumed primarily low-density residential growth and
traditional roadway capacity-adding transportation improvements. Scenario 1
assumed a mid-range of increased development density, a limited amount of
redevelopment in some areas, and the provision of light rail in the corridor, in
addition to roadway widening on NC 54. Scenario 2 assumed a higher density of
development in the corridor, focused around the light rail stations, significant
redevelopment of several areas, including Glen Lennox and the Friday Center
area, the shift of park and ride facilities to the proposed Leigh Village area, a new
interchange on I-40 to directly serve the new park-and-ride facility, and no
roadway widening on NC 54. The scenarios were developed to be intentionally
different, so the varying aspects of each could be modeled and the performance
measures of each compared and presented at the workshop.

In the workbooks at each table, a map and written description were provided for
each of the three scenarios, and the participants were asked to answer a series
of questions regarding these scenarios. The questions were the same for each
scenario, and are listed below:

   1.   Does this scenario address the visioning issues from Workshop 1?
   2.   How is the land use and development in this scenario?
   3.   How is the density in this scenario?
   4.   Do the transportation improvements fit the scenario?
   5.   Is the growth assumption reasonable?
   6.   What did you like and dislike about the scenario?
The responses recorded at each table are presented in the full report that follows
this summary.

After spending about 45 minutes going through each of the scenarios individually
and recording comments, there was a brief presentation on the results of the
analysis conducted on the three scenarios. Various performance measures were
highlighted in this presentation, including:

·   Traffic volume shift            ·   Jobs and households within ¼ mile of
·   Mode split                          transit stops
·   Percent delay                   ·   New development in walkable areas
·   Congested speed                 ·   Light-rail boardings

The workshop participants were invited to fill out a large matrix with comments on
the comparisons between the three scenarios, particularly with regard to the
identified performance measures. The goal of this exercise was to collect
information on participants' preferences with regard to each scenario, to provide
guidance in the development of a preferred scenario for additional testing and
refinement. The participants were also asked to clearly identify those comments
that were consensus items among participants (by recording these in a different
color), while still allowing individual comments to also be recorded. The
responses recorded at each table are presented in the full report that follows this
summary.

As might be expected, there was a diversity of opinion among the participants in
the workshop. Relatively few tables noted any single one of the three scenarios
as their preferred scenario, although a few did--more commonly, the participants
noted aspects of all three scenarios that they liked or disliked. Some tables were
able to arrive at consensus conclusions, while others were divided on many
issues. The comments from Group 11 provide an excellent example of a divided
group, where some participants preferred low-growth and others preferred high-
density in support of transit. While there was not a unanimous consensus
direction provided by the participants' comments, there are several themes that
arise in many of the comments, including:

·   Several comments are in favor of a new interchange on I-40 to serve the
    Leigh Village area and a re-located park-and-ride lot; however, almost all of
    them also note that this interchange should not be built in a way that would
    impact Leigh Farm Park. There are also several comments against a new
    interchange, due to the impact it would have on traffic and development in
    that area, and the potential impacts to the park.
·   One common theme is that increased density could be problematic if light rail
    is not constructed; suggestions provided on how to address this include
    keeping development densities low, widening NC 54 in all alternatives,
    implementing improved bus service, and constructing an alternate route to
    serve Chatham County-to-RTP traffic. Some comments also acknowledge

NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study Public Workshop 2 comments                             2
    that additional density and worsened congestion conditions could help
    promote transit ridership.
·   Several participants noted the need to address bottleneck intersections, such
    as those at I-40, Farrington Road, and US 15-501.
·   Several participants noted that the proposed light-rail system should serve
    Research Triangle Park, RDU Airport, and other points to the east. There was
    not consensus on whether the light-rail route should go through
    Meadowmont, as currently proposed, or should go along 54.
·   Several comments were provided in favor of creating additional satellite park-
    and-ride lots at locations such as Leigh Village, Gateway Center, and
    Southpoint Mall.
·   Many commenters were in favor of widening NC 54 to six lanes, some even
    thought it was needed for Scenario 2. However, some commenters were
    against widening NC 54, citing either the increased density it would bring or
    the need to improve other alternatives first.
·   Multi-modal accessibility concerns were prevalent, whether it was for support
    of regional light rail, BRT, an improved bus regional service, or the need to
    incorporate a bike/ped system that would adequately serve those users.
·   Several commenters favored the collector street network, but some voiced an
    opinion against the Meadowmont Lane portion due to the close proximity to a
    school. An equal number supported improving travel options through that
    area.

The following sections of this report present the comments that were provided by
the workshop participants, as recorded on their group workbooks.

Group Workbook Comments
Participants in the workshop were seated at one of fifteen tables, and each table
was provided with a group workbook. In the first section of the workbook, the
groups were asked to generally comment on the transportation and land use
scenarios that were developed for the workshop, and were provided with a list of
six questions to address for each scenario. These comments were not limited to
group consensus comments, and could include individual comments. In the
second section, participants were provided with a large matrix, where they could
make comments regarding elements of each of the scenarios that they liked and
disliked, comparing the scenarios to each other, and providing guidance on their
preferred scenarios. In this second section, individuals were still welcome to
write comments, but group consensus items were also noted, by highlighting
these in a different color in the workbooks--in the tables below, these consensus
items are noted with bold font.

Additional Post-Workshop Comments (as of 3/5/10)
At the end of the summary from each table group, we added several comments
that were received after the workshop, organized by topic.

Group 1
Comments on           1. We don't feel this scenario addresses Workshop 1 issues because all it does is widen the
Trend                 highway. It doesn't address alternate transportation, and is a stopgap measure.
                      2. The land use ­ especially the predominance of single-family ­ is good. Too much
                      commercial use would only add to the traffic. However, it also depends on the commercial type
                      ­ if you have more residential, grocery-type/support stores, that means people need to drive
                      more.
                      3. Growth in Orange County, which is slow, does not support the building of more offices.
                      4. We are not in favor of widening the highway because the gridlock is at the endpoints (15-501
                      and 40) and not on 54. Suggest bus "pull-offs" for loading/unloading on 54.
                      5. The amount of growth assumed in this scenario seems reasonable.
                      6. Like lower density. Dislike widening of highway idea.
Comments on           1. Concerned that light rail can't go through this area due to topography.
Scenario 1
                      2. Need more vegetation, especially in the mixed-use areas.
                      3. Keep higher density, smaller footprint around the transit hub.
                      4. BRT focus needed ­ concerned funding for light rail doesn't happen. The bus to light-rail
                      linkage needs to be spelled out, other people won't be incentivized to use the light rail. Is there
                      going to be any parking available at both ends of the light rail system? There needs to be.
                      What does making 54 wider "do" in this scenario? BRT should be able to move the people,
                      mitigating need for such a wide 54.
                      5. The growth assumptions aren't reasonable if there isn't money for light rail. However, light
                      rail is the future, so if the planning doesn't "allow" for it, the region could lose out in the future.
                      6. Like mixed use. Dislike widening 54. Logical place for light rail is from Carrboro to Durham.
                      Would rather keep development small around the base, not spread out.
Comments on           1. Add bike lanes and ped crossings/paths concept to plans.
Scenario 2
                      2. If BRT is fully developed, redeveloping close to the road makes sense.
                      4. Need to see how well the HOV lanes are used before expanding them. Need to clarify that
                      there is direct access off I-40 to proposed Leigh Village park-and-ride for all vehicles ­ HOV
                      lane and regular lane.
                      6. Like that park-and-ride traffic will bypass the 54/I-40 intersection, but not at the expense of
                      any parking. Put a park-and-ride lot right off I-40 and connect it to light rail transit. Dislike taking
                      any part of Leigh Farm Park for development. Dislike road widening because of pedestrian
                      crossing impact. Want bike lanes as well as BRT.

Group 2
Comments on           1. This scenario does address workshop 1 issues. 6 lanes from Barbee to 40 going west is ok.
Trend
                      2. Prefer density development in downtown Chapel Hill rather than at Leigh Station or along
                      the corridor.
                      3. More housing.
                      4. What are the transportation improvements in downtown Chapel Hill?
                      5. The growth assumptions are probably too low.
                      6. Widening 54 to 6 lanes will result in the loss of a significant part of Oaks Condominium
                      property. This scenario stops at the Durham County line? Potential bottleneck at Chapel
                      Hill/Orange County line.
Comments on           1. Any express bus stop along the corridor?
Scenario 1
                      2. The land use and development patterns in this corridor are reasonable and likely.
                      3. Density seems appropriate. Concerned about increasing density along this already over-
                      used corridor.
                      4. Want light rail into downtown Chapel Hill, to DPAC, Durham Bulls Stadium, American
                      Tobacco, Duke, RDU, Central University
                      5. Growth assumptions are reasonable.
                      6. Like collector street network. Dislike widening 54 to 6 lanes ­ need clarify about flow of
                      traffic through the corridor. Dislike light rail through Meadowmont ­ realign along 54. If you do
                      this, will you still need to widen 54?
Comments on           1. To increase density to increase light rail, consider downtown Chapel Hill in the mix.
Scenario 2
                      2. Concerns about the safety of a light rail terminal so close to Glenwood School. Keep Glen
                      Lennox residential.
                      3. High density development should only be allowed with the guarantee of light rail.
                      4. Like collector street plan. Like additional exit off I-40. Want 6 lane 54 even with light rail.
                      5. Move light rail realignment along 54/George King ­ not Meadowmont Lane. (not everyone
                      agrees)
                      6. Like 3 new park-and-rides to disperse traffic. Like Leigh Park interchange, but preserve park
                      if possible. Concerns with additional development at Friday Center.

                      3. More commercial, especially in Orange County.
                      4. Bus system needs to match LRTP. Grade separation along 54.
                      5. All scenarios too low in population and jobs.
                      6. Doesn't fix Farrington Road to I-40 funnel. Six lanes on 54 won't solve problem. 54 grade
                      separation might be a solution for some scenarios.
Comments on           1. This scenario is best of the three. Move ramp from east side of I-40 to west side, at
Scenario 2            proposed Leigh Village. Avoid sensitive area.
                      2. Free up Finley Golf Course for other uses. Modest density, mixed use, transport.
                      3. Utilize 2010 census in future plans, or amend plan once census data is available.
                      4. Match bus system to LRP stop. Consider grade variances on 54. Consider overhead and
                      underground ramps north-south 54 (i.e., Meadowmont)
                      4. HOV flyover ramp makes sense.
                      5. Most reasonable growth scenario ­ still probably too low.
                      6. Like ramp to/from I-40. Move ramp (HOV only) north or south or to other side of I-40 if
                      necessary to preserve park. Consider schools in park. Make park more accessible.

Group 4
Comments on           Need on ramp at I-40 and Leigh Village.
Trend
                      1. Does not address workshop 1 issues at all. Removes some traffic off 54 but, increases
                      volume on 54 to accommodate growth and may move congestion to other hot points.
                      2. Low density may be desired, but as a long-term solution, it's impractical.
Comments on           3. Utilize vertical mixed use along 54 corridor. Higher density along 54 and lower away from it.
Scenario 1            Better balance than trend scenario. A lot of green pockets to hide high density growth.
                      4. Still need new southern transit routes (North Chatham/Southern Orange). Early and late
                      schedules are needed or rail/bus will not help UNC Hospital needs. Transportation
                      improvement don't fit scenario. 75% of traffic on 54 is transit (passing through). There must be
                      no increase in traffic lights. Focus on bottlenecks (40 and Farrington). Coordinate traffic lights.
                      5. Growth assumptions on Durham side seem reasonable. On Chapel Hill side, there is more
                      high density not reflected in the study area (i.e., Carolina North).
                      6. Like light rail and may allow non-drivers to move in or access UNC/businesses, etc. Dislike
                      that it changes the complexion of the neighborhoods/area.
Comments on           2. Mixed use at Meadowmont too far from transit station.
Scenario 2
                      3. Vertical mixed use/high density is good. Force mixed use.
                      4. No new interchange at designated location (ridiculous). No interchange period ­ utilize
                      existing 54 and 15-501 efficiency. Move interchange to Farrington Road. Need southern
                      access to 40 from south Orange County/north Chatham county.
                      5. Growth assumptions reasonable fro Durham. More growth expected in Chapel Hill outside
                      study area.
                      6. Dislike that it negatively changes complexion of community neighborhoods.

Group 5
Comments on         Maintain tree canopy and existing roads in Glen Lennox.
Trend
                    1. Present infrastructure ignored by current collector street proposal. Will infrastructure be
                    moved to fit Leigh Village? It appears proposed collector streets are there to accommodate
                    Leigh Village.
                    2. Many "yellow" areas will be much denser ­ not realistic.
                    3. Celeste Circle should be commercial.
                    4. Collector streets don't connect well to 54. Where will the lights be? Too many to work?
                    These transportation improvements do nothing to fix double left turn lanes at Friday Center
                    (which are underutilized). Traffic from Barbee Chapel left to Chapel Hill is not addressed.
                    Consider extra lane on Barbee Chapel for Chatham traffic. Widen Farrington? Why not route
                    Falconbridge homeowners over to Farrington Road?
                    5. Several single family areas likely to be much lighter density than shown on plan (i.e., much
                    shown as single family is currently commercial).
                    6. Don't understand what's really changing. Dislike that it's not an accurate starting point.
                    Bradford Place is residential condos, not office. Yellow spot on Barbee Chapel is already
                    rezoned for townhouses, not single family.
Comments on         1. Existing infrastructure ignored (traffic lights, etc).
Scenario 1
                    2. Hamilton Road construction area a mess. It should remain residential.
                    3. Land use types are more realistic than trend, but no consensus in group whether this is good
                    or bad. Glen Lennox as mixed-use is inconsistent with probable designation as NCD.
                    4. No good access from built up Hamilton Road area. 4 lanes on Barbee Chapel to support
                    higher density. Can we handle peak load? Collector road connections to 54 still not
                    addressed.
                    5. Some like high density growth assumptions along 54. Others will like Woodmont will be the
                    final straw in traffic failure on 54.
                    6. How to get to transit stop at Leigh Village. Need to pull park-and-ride off 54.
Comments on         1. With Woodmont increasing traffic, you are not addressing traffic issue between 40 and
Scenario 2          Barbee Chapel. But still need to widen 54 to 6 lanes. Collectors to 54 continue to ignore
                    existing infrastructure.
                    2. Sherwood Forest is not likely to sell out any time soon. Glen Lennox as apartment/condo is
                    overdevelopment that is inconsistent with probable designation as NCD.
                    4. School traffic is challenging with HOV placement, although additional I-40 access is a good
                    idea between exits 270 and 273 towards Farrington Bridge.

                        redistribution of park-and-ride with express bus service. Dislike that Meadowmont's density is
                        not enough for a light rail stop.

Comments on              1. Pretty well, but even this option is too dense.
Trend
                         2. Eliminate commercial development at Farrington/I-40 bridge near Ephesus Church Road.
                         3. More low density residential.
                         4. Transportation improvements fit the scenario. Do not like connector from Farrington to
                         Nottingham. HOV and 54 widening are enough; HOV is actually overkill.
                         5. Growth assumptions are reasonable.
                         6. Like lower densities and no negative impact on Leigh Farm Park. Dislike major sites of
                         community importance, like Creekside School and Leigh Farm Park are not noted on the map.
Comments on              1. Not well, light rail requires densities that are inappropriate. If light rail occurs, it should follow
Scenario 1               15-501, between Durham and Chapel Hill.
                         2. Land use and development patterns are too dense.
                         3. Land use types are too dense.
                         4. Eliminate light rail.
                         5. Growth assumptions are overly high for an environmentally sensitive area.
                         6. Dislike impact of Chapel Hill-driven agenda that is forcing high densities onto Durham and
                         that Leigh Farm Park and Creekside School are not noted on map.
Comments on              1. Doesn't address workshop 1 issues at all.
Scenario 2
                         2. Land use and development patterns too dense in the extreme.
                         3. Land use types too dense.
                         4. Scenario is inappropriate.
                         5. Growth assumptions far overblown.
                         6. Dislike that Leigh Farm Park not noted and the interchange on top of Leigh Farm Park.

Trend
                         2. Concerns about Southwest Drive. Land use and development patterns not optimal because
                         goes through existing development. Development is big enough to support investment, but
                         must ensure infrastructure.
                         3. Some mixed use in undeveloped areas.
                         4. Invariably more cars.
                         5. Some say growth assumptions are reasonable, others say not.
                         6. Like single family density. Dislike lack of mixed use.
Comments on              1. Does not address thru traffic from Chatham County. Rail works for UNC and Duke,
Scenario 1               but not east-west to RTP. None of the themes, issues, and opportunities from
                         Workshop 1.
                         2. Soft edit for high density development "density gradient" ­ concern with impact on lakes.
                         Disagreement on whether high density can protect water quality. Concern about low price
                         housing.

                         6. Dislike interchange's Leigh Farm impact. Protect New Hope Corridor ­ Ephesus
                         Church to Jordan High School is not safe. Additional park-and-ride lots are good.

Trend
                         5. Growth assumptions, as minimal growth, are reasonable.
Comments on              1. This alternative fairly addresses workshop 1 issues.
Scenario 1
                         2. Land use and development patterns viewed as favorable. Would like to see slow growth.

                         5. I would prefer to have low density single family housing. We want density to support light
                         rail.
                         6. Like that scenario supports light rail.

Scenario 2               it should not.
                         2. Land use and development patterns fit with transit community. Land use and development
                         patterns are too much development.
                         2. Too much park areas. Too much development.
                         3. Some think density is too high.
                         4. Without 54 widening, the improvements do not fit the scenario.
                         5. Disagreement on whether growth assumptions are reasonable.

Comments on              1. Would prefer 54 to stay 4 lanes to reduce VMT and to encourage development of light rail.
Trend
                         3. Offices on Farrington Road will exacerbate traffic problems at the intersection with 54.
                         4. Fits every scenario like SW Durham Drive and other Durham connectors. What provisions
                         are made to make the roads acceptable for public transportation/buses?
                         5. I think this is on the low end for 2035.
                         6. Like that it keeps Eastwood Park residential. Leaves congestion at stoplights, especially
                         around Falconbridge Road and I-40.
Comments on              2. Intense development makes 54/I-40 interchange worse. Traffic lights increase congestion.
Scenario 1
                         4. Transportation improvements help, but traffic will still get worse, especially at intersections
                         (54-Farrington-40).
                         5. Growth should be predicated upon first constructing the traffic infrastructure.
                         6. Like commercial near light rail station in Leigh Village and like Meadowmont lane. Dislike
                         that Eastwood Park becomes commercial; it should stay residential. Need park-and-ride on
                         751 near I-40/54
Comments on              3. Place commercial around light rail rather than around 54 to encourage use of rail vs. more
Scenario 2               strip malls and drive-thrus.
                         4. The transportation improvements help but still will probably have traffic congestion,
                         especially at intersections. Need to improve intersections.
                         5. Would like to have road/rail infrastructure first, then if there is capacity, development.
                         6. Like satellite parking-and-ride, especially at 751. Dislike Eastwood Park as commercial,
                         keep residential.

Comments on           2. This is a "business-as-usual" vision. Does not take advantage of the strategic location of
Trend                 Leigh Village to accommodate growth in the area between Durham and Chapel Hill.
                      3. Seems like there are more jobs being added via mixed-use development. Development
                      likely to be very slow due to the high cost of infrastructure (Water and sewer) with little
                      incentive, if there's low density residential.
                      4. Improvements come short ­ already have problems at I-40/54 interchange. 54 and
                      Farrington Foad will not handle increased commuter traffic and the intersection of Farrington,
                      54, and I-40 are currently inadequate for increased commuter traffic.
                      5. Scale of growth is unreasonable ­ numbers are too conservative.
                      6. Like low density and residential vision.
Comments on           2. Like the walkable, small grid around the light rail nodes.
Scenario 1
                      3. Mixed use center on both sides of 54 should be better integrated into light rail path.
                      4. Need to figure out southern connection to Farrington Road across 54. Currently, it appears
                      to route through residential streets. Meadowmont Lane extension could become dangerous
                      due to increased traffic through the residential area. New collector streets through
                      Meadowmont will become very burdened by traffic from light rail node traffic moving toward
                      Chapel Hill. Widening 54 is a necessity, especially if collector streets are dumping traffic onto
                      54. If Farrington Road is still a major artery (collector streets dumping traffic onto it), then the
                      Farrington/54 intersection must be improved. A second access from Farrington to 40 is needed
                      close to Trenton Ro. Seems this scenario is trying to use both rail transit and improve highways
                      for cars and buses ­ in which case, highways will win and rail will be under-utilized.
                      5. Growth assumptions are reasonable. Population density may not be such that it would justify
                      rail transit unless at the high end.
                      6. Like path of light rail.
Comments on           3. Near Leigh Village, more density towards the transit station, so greenspace can be
Scenario 2            preserved. Potential for more high-tech businesses, medical facilities.
                      4. Not happy with I-40 flyover and cloverleaf (half). Do not want Leigh Park land used for this.
                      Extension of Meadowmont to SW Durham Drive will reroute traffic from I-40 through
                      Meadowmont, past school, in order to avoid congestion on 54 (especially when only 4 lanes).
                      Creating a new interchange opens up more problems than it solves. What about transit access
                      near the Friday Center? A second intersection of Farrington Rd and 40 at Trenton Road would
                      really help relieve traffic on 54, especially if you keep 54 at 4 lanes. More park-and-rides are
                      good, especially close to the transit station, but it could be north of the transit station and
                      accessible from both Farrington/54 intersection and my proposed new intersection at Trenton
                      Rd. This may eliminate the need for fly-over access and reduce impact on Leigh Park.

Appendix ­ Email comments received since Public Workshop 1
         Traffic Issues
         I-40/NC-54/Farrington Road Solutions:
         -   At the Farrington Road ­ NC 54 intersection, approaching the intersection
             South bound on Farrington Road:
                    a) Lengthen the right turn only lane to 300 to 400 yards back from the
                       intersection.
                    b) Widen Farrington Road to provide 2 left hand turn lanes with the
                       left most turn lane for either NC 54 East bound and/or I 40 East
                       bound and the second left turn only lane dedicated solely to I 40
                       East Bound.
                    c) Extend the all turn lanes an additional 300 yards north of the
                       intersection.
                    d) Item (b) immediately above would probably also require a re-
                       working of the entrance to I 40 East Bound to lengthen the merge
                       lanes.
         -   Lengthen the left turn only lane on East bound NC 54 at Farrington Road
             back to the Falconbridge Road. It is too short now and cars turning left end
             up blocking car proceeding east bound on NC 54 through the Farrington
             Road intersection.
         -   North bound on Farrington Road at the NC 54 intersection:
                    a) Widen and lengthen the left turn lane, and add a second left turn
                       lane.
                    b) Lengthen the right turn only lane.
         -   Install a "DO NOT BLOCK INTERSECTION" sign at Little John Road East
             bound on NC 54.
         -   To facilitate the flow of traffic on NC 54, into to Chapel Hill in the morning and
             exiting Chapel Hill in the evening rush hour, arrange all the traffic lights in
             both directions on NC 54 in sequence.
         -   Barbee Chapel Road north bound at NC 54:
                    a) Widen to 3 lanes to include a right turn only lane.
                    b) Extend multiple lanes back to almost the Finley Forest entrance.
         -   Widen NC 54 to 4 lanes between Farrington Road and NC 751.
         -   Provide a direct access to I 40 from Farrington Mill Road to accommodate the
             hundreds of cars driving from Chatham County to I 40 at Farrington Road.
             Or in the alternative, provide direct access from Farrington Mill Road to
             Stagecoach Road so Chatham County driver could access I 40 at NC 751.
         -   Install traffic signals at the Stagecoach Road - Farrington Road intersection.
         -   Install traffic signals where Farrington Mill Road "T" intersects with Farrington
             Road/Barbee Chapel Road.

-   Widen Stagecoach Road at Farrington Road to provide both left and right
    turn lanes.
-   Longer term, widen both Farrington Road and Barbee Chapel Road to 4
    lanes.
I-40/NC-54/Farrington Road intersection comments:
-   I live in the Trenton neighborhood. Several residents have been very vocal in
    their opposition to an interchange at I-40 and Farrington Road. I am not one
    of them. I would welcome easy access to I-40, and the ability to avoid the
    very busy and sometimes dangerous intersection at Farrington and 54.
-   Adding lanes and an interchange at Farrington Rd. would only funnel more
    traffic to the already abysmally dysfunctional intersection of Farrington Rd.,
    NC 54 and I-40. Interchanges CREATE slowdowns and congestion; they do
    not relieve them. Open stretches of interstate highway allow for free flowing
    traffic; interchanges gum up the works. There is a logical reason why federal
    guidelines stipulate that interchanges should be 2 miles apart; that principle is
    violated here. Interchanges also bring tremendous pressure for dense,
    intense land use changes...simply not appropriate along this low-density
    residential portion of Farrington Rd. That decision was affirmed by the
    removal of a transit stop from the area (near Creekside School).
-   We are strongly opposed to the proposed interchange at Farrington Road
    and I-40. When I attended the initial hearing held in September of 2008 a
    great many people both through writing and in person expressed their
    concern with this proposed exit. The committee as well expressed their
    strong opposition to this proposal. This being said I am unclear how a
    proposal with such strong opposition from the public and from elected
    officials from multiple towns, cities and counties could become part of the
    preferred option transportation plan. I find it necessary, therefore, to reiterate
    the objections expressed during that meeting. They are as follows:
           a) Federal highway guidelines state that interchanges on interstate
              highways must be 2 miles apart. Creating one at Farrington Road
              would mean that there would be 3 interchanges within 2 miles.
              The proposed exit would therefore, violate federal law.
           b) Farrington Road is zoned as a low density residential greenbelt
              and is home to five sites on the Durham Inventory of Cultural and
              Natural Resources. Creating a interchange here would, therefore,
              violate the zoning ordinances.
           c) Durham planning documents state that activity centers should be
              at least a mile apart. Adding an interchange at Farrington Road
              would create an additional activity center less than a mile from the
              one at 54 and Farrington Road. The proposed exit, therefore,
              violates Durham public policy.
           d) The creation of the additional interchange in this low density area
              would create dangerous congestion for the numerous residents in
              the area and for the children attending both public and private


NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study Public Workshop 2 comments                                34
               schools in the immediate vicinity. This proposed interchange
               would be within feet of a large cemetary, within yards of the newly
               constructed Creekside elementary school and within a couple of
               miles of Githens Middle School. The addition of this exit would,
               therefore, create adverse and possibly perilous situations for the
               residents of Durham and Chapel Hill and their children.
-   Pressure for an interchange is coming from Chapel Hill; Durham needs to say
    no to the continual push of development and congestion out of Chapel Hill
    and into SW Durham. That process began by pushing Chapel Hill's outer
    belt loop, the Laurel Hill Parkway, from Sage Rd. to Pope Rd. to Farrington
    Rd. in an ever eastward progression. The name is now Southwest Durham
    Drive!
-   An interchange at I-40 and Farrington Road would put our children at risk,
    threaten the historic Leigh Farm and environmentally sensitive Water Fowl
    Federal Lands, and violate the graves of those laid to rest at Markham
    Memorial Gardens cemetery.
-   Specific land uses in the vicinity of Farrington and I-40 include the Prescott
    Place, Glenview Park and Trenton neighborhoods, the Markham Memorial
    Gardens cemetery and Leigh Farm Park, 86 acres of open space protected
    over the last 20 years by a public private partnership including the Jr. League
    of Durham and Orange Counties, Triangle Land Conservancy, the State
    Dept. of Cultural and Natural Resources, DUTAG, DOST, Historic
    Preservation of Durham, Durham Parks and Rec, SEEDS and Piedmont
    Wildlife. There is literally no room for an interchange without destroying
    something of great value (homes, graves, park land).
-   Farrington Rd. is a low-density residential greenbelt with 5 sites on the
    Durham Inventory of Cultural and Natural Resources. Leigh Farm Park in
    particular is a gem of open space and anchor to the New Hope Creek
    Corridor trail system. It should be protected, not drowned in asphalt and
    congestion.
Collector Street Plan:
-   Current proposed collector roads which run along Celeste Circle and
    Crossland Drive will adversely impact the access to and from the homes
    located within Eastwood Park. The homeowners of Eastwood Park proposed
    a new collector road which would utilize the current infrastructure located at
    NC54. The proposal utilizes an existing stoplight at the intersection of
    Highway 54 which is used by the homeowners of Eastwood Park and
    Falconbridge as well as the businesses located along the service road on
    Highway 54. The homeowners of Eastwood Park propose that the land
    located within Eastwood Park be allocated as Highway Commercial and
    Office Development.
-   George King Rd. should be paved and the Meadowmont Connector built as
    planned.

Other Traffic Issues:
-   A Southern connector joining 15-501 and 751 should be investigated as an
    alternative route to help relieve congestion on NC 54.
-   Another concept to investigate: Existing I-40 could become business I-40
    (as with I-85 in Greensboro and I-40 in Winston-Salem) with a new I-40
    bypassing the Triangle to the south.
-   Given that the reason that the location of Creekside Elementary School is
    why the study area extends as far north as it does -- per my direct request to
    MPO staff in an early discussion at the MPO -- it should shown on maps.
    School traffic leaving for other parts of its massive attendance zone, creates
    a stand-alone peak of about 30 minutes duration, almost all of it loading into
    south-bound Farrington Road and thence into the east-bound single left turn
    lane. There have been days when the left-turn wait itself approached the full
    30 minutes of the peak period. That is to say, someone coming from the
    north (e.g., this writer) would have had to wait 30 minutes to get onto NC 54.
    I always U-turned and found another route to the RTP, or Raleigh, the latter
    trip taking hardly more than 30 minutes by itself. I have been told that
    adjustment of the signal cycle is not feasible for that stand-alone peak period
    because it is separated from the "normal" peak hour. Given that this turning
    movement is at LOS F for 6-8 hours a day, I have to wonder.
Alternative/Multi-Modal Transportation
-   Funding for transit may never materialize; exploding densities (based on
    the presupposition of transit corridors) could be a serious mistake, destroying
    the very character that makes North Carolina more attractive than New
    Jersey.
-   Safe passage through the I-40/NC54/exit 273 gauntlet. The interchange, with
    its one-leaf clover, is a deathtrap for cyclists and pedestrians heading west
    on NC54, especially since NCDOT widened the ramp into a double lane
    racetrack. Better options, in order of safety preference:
           a) Bike-ped bridge over (or tunnel under) I-40, just north of NC54,
              connecting with future light rail corridor
           b) Stoplight on the cloverleaf that bike-ped commuters can activate
              by push button
           c) 12', two-way bike-ped sidepath on south side of NC54
-   The Exit 273 interchange area is generally considered the most dangerous
    section of surface street for 'cyclists in Durham and Orange Counties. We've
    never had a fatality on that part of NC 54 -- although have had another well-
    known one to the west -- probably because we simply avoid it.
-   There is a 10-foot sidepath on the north and south sides of NC 54 for the
    entire length of the Meadowmont community. The sides are connected with a
    reconstructed cattle tunnel in Meadowmont. All other connections are at-

    grade at signals, and I find them difficult because of the briefness of the
    available signal cycle.
-   As a new Triangle Transit trustee, I am not aware of any use proposed within
    the 50-foot wide light rail corridor besides the 28-foot wide dual-track
    alignment. The TT Board of Trustees voted yesterday to initiate the NEPA
    process via an Alternatives Analysis, and additional use of the corridor may
    come up in that process. The heavily-used Libba Cotten trail is in an
    abandoned rail ROW.
-   Rail-WITH-TRAIL, if light rail ever ventures into reality, should be
    incorporated into each and every design model. Plenty of working examples
    of RWT exist in the U.S., including the Libba Cotten Trail in Carrboro.
Development/Greenspace Issues
-   The development of Carolina North must be taken into account when
    studying future traffic needs in this area.
-   Farrington Rd. is a low-density residential greenbelt with 5 sites on the
    Durham Inventory of Cultural and Natural Resources. Leigh Farm Park in
    particular is a gem of open space and anchor to the New Hope Creek
    Corridor trail system. Preservation, not more pavement, is our watchword.

                              Level of Agreement Responses

On Tuesday, May 11, the NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study project team held the third and final
public involvement workshop and presented the preferred scenario. The scenario
included land use designations, transit centers, bicycle and pedestrian improvements, and
a "superstreet concept" for NC-54. Following the conclusion of Workshop 3, participants
were encouraged to complete a Comment Sheet, which included eight statements about
the land use, transit, bicycle and pedestrian, and roadway improvements presented in the
preferred scenario. Participants scaled their level of agreement with the statements, which
will help the project team assess the public's opinion about various elements of the
preferred scenario.

Each of the eight statements below are accompanied by a bar chart illustrating each
respondent's level of agreement, the count of the number of respondents who chose each
level of agreement, the percent of respondents who chose each level of agreement, and
the combined percent of respondents who were generally opposed to or in agreement
with the statement.

Note: The number of respondents varies because not all respondents provided a response
for all eight statements. The percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number, so
they may not add up to exactly 100%.

The number of respondents was low, compared to the actual number of participants who
attended the third workshop. Generally, these level of agreement responses are skewed
towards "strongly opposed" and "opposed," but three statements were especially
weighted in opposition: #5 - bicycle and pedestrian improvements will solve critical
problems, #6 - the roadway improvement strategy will improve vehicle travel, and #8 -
the roadway modifications support traffic growth.

Also, while the number of participants who "agreed" or "strongly agreed" was generally
in the 26-31% range for most statements, only 13% of respondents "agreed" or "strongly
agreed" with the statement about bicycle and pedestrian improvements solving critical
problems (#5).

                                        Comments

The workshop participants were also encouraged to submit their comments in response to
the elements in the preferred scenario. Below is the summary of comments submitted on
comment cards, comments submitted by email, and verbal comments made during the
workshop.

Light Rail Transit
Summary of written comments submitted on comment cards and by email:
Many participants advocated moving the light rail transit line out of the environmentally
sensitive area when it leaves Leigh Village and heads to 54. They all suggest running the
line parallel to NC-54. Several others did not want the LRT line to run through
Meadowmont, based on the proposed development and park and ride lot locations. Many
commenters indicated that light rail must be in place before the density developments
could start construction. One commenter saw the light rail as promoting growth in the
area, which that commenter did not want. Participants stressed the need to connect the
LRT line for Chapel Hill, Durham, RTP and RDU Airport.

Verbal comments made during the workshop:
One commenter asked if safety along the transit line was considered for the transit
centers, since density was going to be so high and the goal was to make it very walkable.
Another commenter was concerned with the current proposed alignment of the light rail
because it runs through ecologically sensitive area. That person wondered if the light rail
could run along 54. A last comment questioned if light rail was contingent on Wake
County, Orange County, and Durham County all giving their approval.

Mass Transit and Park and Ride Lots
Summary of written comments submitted on comment cards and by email:
Many commenters were against the proposed park and ride lot near the Falconbridge
neighborhood, at the wastewater plant, stating that it could cause dangerous traffic issues
in that neighborhood and would exacerbate traffic problems at the NC-54/Farrington Rd
intersection. One wondered why a park and ride was proposed on Farrington Rd, when
the superstreet concept would essentially close Farrington Rd at the NC-54 intersection ­
suggesting that people would be motivated to cut through the Falconbridge neighborhood
rather than back track around Barbee Chapel in order to go to points east or to gain access
to I-40.Another commenter believes Farrington Road would become more congested
with a park and ride, as well as with the addition of a transfer station in the Falconbridge
Shopping Center. While the intention would be for commuters to park in the Park &
Ride, the commenter thinks commuters will opt to park closer ­ in the shopping center at
the corner of NC-54 and Farrington Road and on the streets in the neighborhood. They
will cut through the neighborhood to reduce congested areas, and to avoid the traffic
patterns created by the Super Streets. Commenters suggested locating the park and ride
lots east of I-40 and NC-54, along the highway, and out of the corridor. One commenter
included the caveat that shuttle service be provided and coordinated to serve both Chapel
Hill and Durham. Other suggested locations included Southpoint Mall and New Hope
Commons. This suggestion was supported by a commenter who felt the proposed park

                             Workshop 3 Public Comments
and ride lot at Leigh Village would only serve to benefit UNC and would actually hinder
traffic flow because, regardless of how commuters accessed that park and ride, the traffic
into the park and ride would create a bottleneck because it would be coming off I-40. One
commenter stated that the proposed NC-751 park and ride lot would not logically serve
Chapel Hill. In general, participants recognized the need for a more robust transit system
that would serve Chapel Hill, Durham, RTP and RDU Airport, among other locations.

One commenter suggested installing bus-only lanes on NC-54 to improve traffic flow
during rush hour in the morning and evening.

Verbal comments made during the workshop:
Participants focused mostly on the park and ride lots proposed on Farrington and near
751. One commenter thought the Farrington park and ride would cause a lot more traffic
issues on NC-54 and another asked whether impacts of the increased traffic on Farrington
Road had been analyzed and accounted for. The comment about the park and ride lot near
751 supported it, believing that it would relieve some of the traffic heading to 54.
However, another commenter said that people would not use that park and ride because
they would not want to travel out of their way instead of heading straight into Chapel
Hill.

Bicycle and Pedestrian
Summary of written comments submitted on comment cards and by email:
Participants were divided over the proposed bicycle and pedestrian system. While many
supported the enhancements and felt they addressed the needs of the bike/ped
community, others felt that the improvements were not enough, and still others did not
believe there are enough users to support enhancing the system.

Safety was a major concern on all fronts. Participants took issue against the proposed
separated bike lane dividing the right turn lane and through lane near the 15-501
interchange, stating safety concerns. Others advocated for bike lanes or paved lanes
separate from the main road or wider and "protected" lanes. One commenter supported
the bike lanes and their enhancement to safety, especially on the eastern side of the
corridor.

Several comments asked to link the bike trail to the American Tobacco Trail in Durham
and RTP. Others suggested a trail to connect Eastwood Park with the nearby proposed
transit center. Another requested bike routes along Barbee Chapel, Farrington,
Stagecoach, NC-751, Scott King, and Massey Chapel roads because of the number of
commuters who bike that path from Chapel Hill to RTP.

Verbal comments made during the workshop:
There was opposition against the dedicated bike lane near the 54/15-501 intersection.
People believed it would not be safe for bikers and would not be used. People do use the
underpass to cross 54 near Meadowmont. Before major changes are made on the road to
facilitate pedestrian crossings, commenters encouraged study on the use of the underpass.
A commenter stated that the bike/ped path proposed to University Mall may not work

because that path is very wet. Another commenter asked if the bike/ped path in Little
Creek will connect to the American Tobacco Trail.

Roadway Enhancement/Superstreet Concept/NC-54
Summary of written comments submitted on comment cards and by email:
There were numerous concerns about the "superstreet concept," including accessibility
issues, impacts to neighborhoods, and lack of addressing congestion problems.
Commenters referred to the existing superstreet at 15-501/Erwin Road and mentioned
how it did not improve traffic conditions and has made it worse at times. Commenters
were skeptical of how it would improve vehicle travel along the corridor and how it
would support future traffic growth. Commenters were concerned with the impacts on
access to neighborhoods and retail areas along NC-54. One commenter was concerned
with the impacts on safety to bicyclists and pedestrians traveling along NC-54 Many
participants who were against the superstreet concept advocated the use of flyovers
instead. The fact that it would be an interim or short-term solution designed to be a cheap
alternative to the long-term solution was also a point on contest.

Some commenters did support the "superstreet concept" and believed it would alleviate
some of the congestion issues in the corridor. Support was shown for the proposed
designs at major intersections. One commenter stated the need for dedicated merge lanes
at the U-turn areas for the concept to succeed. Another commenter suggested looking at
allowing vehicles to go straight across 54 from any of the side streets, but continue
forcing left turns to U-turn.

Some commenters stated the need to widen 54, even up to eight lanes. However, one
commenter stated that the problem is "peak time" travel problems, where the congestion
only occurs during morning and evening rush hours. This commenter believed travel
demand management strategies, not road widening, would address congestion issues.
This commenter was also concerned with the environmental impacts from widening NC-
54. This commenter provided several alternatives solutions: including 1) add one HOT
lane in either direction for carpoolers (charge SOVs for use of the lane); 2) work with
UNC to stagger employees' shifts so that employees enter and exit the corridor at
different times; and 3) increase parking fees at UNC campus

Verbal comments made during the workshop:
There were diverse comments about the superstreet proposal. There were several
concerns related to the actual learning curve, whether the superstreet actually reduces
wait time, if it was worth spending money on that improvement instead of other
alternatives, and if that improvement would actually encourage even more traffic on the
corridor. One person commented on their positive experience with the superstreet at
Erwin Road. One commenter suggested making the superstreet U-turn a dedicated lane
for easy merging and so signals can be eliminated. Another solution was to have
dedicated lanes on 54 straight to 40 for cars that want to travel straight through the
corridor and a dedicated lane for cars that need to access side streets.

I-40/NC-54/Farrington Interchange



                                          7 of 12
                                                                  NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study
                               Workshop 3 Public Comments
Summary of written comments submitted on comment cards and by email:
Commenters provided suggestions to improve the interchange and varied widely. One
commenter suggested routing traffic via NC-751 to enter Chapel Hill; another suggested
a new I-40 exit at Ephesus Church Road or a new I-40 exit directly to the Leigh Village
park and ride lot; and another commenter stated the need for "overpasses or interchanges
to go north-south across I-40 from Farrington Road." Some commenters believed the
superstreet concept at this interchange in particular will not address or solve the traffic
issues and might bring economic harm to businesses at the intersection. Commenters did
agree that some kind of improvement was needed, and sooner rather than later. This
might be one of the first things to address in the corridor.

Regarding the proposed changes at this intersection, one commenter had this statement.
"The rerouted Farrington Road traffic will travel along a segment of what is now Celeste
Circle and will utilize the current Celeste Circle/NC54 intersection. Placement of the
rerouted road and widening of the Celeste Circle segment will require the removal of
several homes in Eastwood Park and an adjacent neighborhood. A prior developer of
Leigh Village believed that four houses would need to be removed. Remaining homes in
Eastwood Park would be adversely affected. For example, a couple of homes will end up
with a major road in their front yard and will be physically separated from the rest of the
neighborhood. Two reasons not to reroute Farrington Road are suggested here:
        - First, if the superstreet plan proposed by the corridor study is accepted, the
        current Farrington Road intersection will be largely atrophied, and the adverse
        effects of this intersection on traffic flow will be greatly reduced.
        - Second, there is an alternative to locating the road through Eastwood Park. It
        should be possible to move the planned intersection about fifty yards to the
        northeast. This would put the rerouted Farrington Road behind the northeastern-
        most houses on Celeste Circle, instead of in front of them. The exact location of
        this road is as follows. As one exits NC-54 and enters Celeste Circle, the first
        building on the right (on the corner of the Service Road and Celeste Circle) is the
        Dermatology Center/Urgent Health Clinic. To the right of this Dermatology
        Building is a space where the proposed road would be located. The next object
        past this space is the Carolina Crossing Building. Thus as one travels on the
        Service Road from Celeste Circle towards Farrington Road, one encounters the
        Dermatology Clinic, the space for a road, the Carolina Crossing Building (a
        commercial establishment), then other commercial/office buildings, and then
        Farrington Road. Although moving the rerouted Farrington Road several yards
        closer to the northeast decreases its planned distance from the interstate, it is still
        much further from the interstate than the current Farrington Road and seems a
        reasonable compromise considering the insult to Eastwood Park that would be
        avoided. This newly proposed path for a rerouted Farrington Road makes sense in
        the context of the superstreet proposal. It is noted that currently across NC-54
        from Celeste Circle is Falconbridge Road. In the superstreet proposal, traffic
        originating on the rerouted Farrington and Falconbridge roads is allowed to turn
        left or right onto NC54, and no left turns are allowed off of NC54 onto rerouted
        Farrington or Falconbridge Roads. Consequently, it is not necessary for the
        rerouted Farrington and Falconbridge Roads to be aligned "head to head". The

                             Workshop 3 Public Comments
       rerouted Farrington and Falconbridge Roads would be offset slightly (about 50
       yards), but would be so close that they would constitute a double T arrangement
       and stop lights at each intersection could readily be synchronized with one
       another. In order for the rerouting of Falconbridge Road proposed here to work, it
       would make sense to atrophy the current Celeste Circle/NC54 intersection, by
       completely blocking direct access between Celeste Circle and NC54. To
       recapitulate, the plan for rerouting Farrington Road proposed here will not require
       loss of residences or serious adverse effects upon residences in or adjacent to
       Eastwood Park. The only structure in the path of the route proposed here is an
       unused small distribution warehouse. In the context of the superstreet, the adverse
       effects of present and anticipated Farrington Road traffic on the Corridor would
       be mitigated by a combination of two mechanisms, the first being the partial
       atrophy of the current Farrington Road and second, the additional connection of
       the rerouted Farrington road which would allow left turns onto NC54 at a location
       significantly further from the interstate than the current Farrington Road/NC54
       intersection. The eastern end of the NC54 Corridor under study is challenging
       with respect to heavy traffic demands and the well being of local communities,
       and the Farrington Road plan proposed here is a reasonable compromise."

A business owner was particularly concerned with the traffic flow and economic impacts
to the shopping center off Farrington Road on the north side of NC-54. The business
owner stated that the additional lane on NC-54 to get onto I-40 greatly improved traffic
flow at that intersection, even on Saturday game days. A resident located off Farrington
Road echoed the traffic flow sentiments and was also concerned about the increase of
traffic on safety. That commenter said the community clubhouse and swimming pool are
adjacent to Farmington Rd, which is the street that wraps around the back side of the
shopping center. Members walk and bike to the clubhouse, so the increase in traffic can
have a major impact on local residents' accessibility to the clubhouse and swimming
pool.

A few commenters were concerned that these drastic changes were first presented at the
latest workshop and that there was no prior indication that major changes were going to
be proposed for the intersection. Commenters worried that the proposed changes were
made without any public input.

Collector Street Plan and other connecting streets
Summary of written comments submitted on comment cards and by email:
Comments were generally supportive of the Collector Street Plan and wanted it
implemented soon. There were several comments of opposition to the currently-planned
alignment of Southwest Durham Drive via Meadowmont Lane, mostly because of its
close proximity to a school and a senior center. Instead, commenters stated that SW
Durham Drive should be connected to George King Road. However, one commenter
stated he heard from Meadowmont residents who attended the Collector Street Plan
Meetings that those residents felt that the Southwest Durham Drive connection to
Meadowmont Lane would be a plus in enhancing their choices for access to/egress from
their community. The commenter believed it would also provide an alternative for

pedestrian and bicycle traffic which might otherwise pass through the region of the Corps
of Engineers Land. The commenter also stated that, at the Chapel Hill town hall meeting,
the Transportation Department representative responded to a question by stating that
Meadowmont Lane had been constructed properly to serve its function as the southern
end of Southwest Durham Drive; thus this commenter believes this intersection, which is
about 9 lanes wide by 6 lanes wide would be a good intersection to use.

A direct connection to 54 from George King Road, and not through Crossland Drive, was
proposed by several commenters.

Commenters advocated that the Collector Street Plan preserve neighborhoods and not
channel traffic through them and deteriorate the neighborhoods. One commenter was
concerned about traffic impacts from funneling traffic down Farrington Road and
requested additional traffic studies to assess how that would affect traffic, access, and the
businesses. Another commenter proposed two alternative solutions: 1) Target the area
near the former Ecko warehouse; or 2) reroute Farrington Road through George King
Road, currently a gravel road at the end of the Celeste Circle neighborhood.

One commenter focused on the area east of 15-501 Morgan Creek-Kings Mill and
suggested "moving the big roads below the ground" because the commenter was
concerned that the proposed addition lanes on NC-54 would "lock residents of the
neighborhood in."

Verbal comments made during the workshop:
Regarding the collector street system, participants had a few comments for specific
streets. The participants noted that the collector street designation from George King
Road straight down to NC-54 is wrong. (The project team will correct the alignment.)
There was major concern with one of the proposed connector roads behind the shopping
center ­ participants said that area was a neighborhood and a community pool and should
not be a connector street and attract vehicles because it currently serves many children
and pedestrians. One commenter questioned whether the SW Durham arterial road is
coming to Meadowmont Lane and if it shouldn't connect to George King Road instead,
because near future development will be closer to George King Road. There were many
concerns expressed about traffic on Meadowmont Lane in the future and the impacts it
would have on the walkability of the community. A last comment urged consideration of
traffic impacts because of Chapel Hill's close proximity to RTP and the travel patterns
between the two areas.

Development
Summary of written comments submitted on comment cards and by email:
There were several comments about the Leigh Village development, possibly because the
workshop group used the Leigh Village location to illustrate a possible high-density
transit center development. Commenters were concerned that Leigh Village was designed
solely to support light rail and that it would increase congestion. It was also seen as
unrealistic and encouraging unwanted growth in the corridor.

                             Workshop 3 Public Comments
Land Use Designations
Summary of written comments submitted on comment cards and by email:
In general, commenters believed the land use designations were too dense and showed
high growth that the residential community does not support. The proposed density was
seen as unsustainable (especially at the Leigh Village development), only there to support
light rail transit, and unrealistic, and having adverse environmental impacts. There were
concerns about development near Farrington Road and how it might impact the senior
assisted-living facility in the area. However, some participants did support the transit-
supportive development and feel it will address future needs.

Another commenter felt the mixed use (tall buildings and retail on the ground floor) will
not necessarily bring foot traffic or the vibrancy that is described when located on vast
wide highways. Much of the area along 54 is low lying and adjacent to Jordan Lake, a
major drinking water resource and the residents in this area depend on surface water for
their water supply. Chapel Hill and Durham should not be encouraging major increases in
building intensities so near buffer areas of Jordan Lake, a drinking water supply for the
region.

A number of participants wanted Eastwood Park to be designated low density residential
and did not want to see any new roads introduced into the neighborhood. Another wanted
to see Eastwood Park incorporated into Leigh Village and yet another suggested turning
Eastwood Park into a parking garage and office complex to siphon some traffic off the
corridor earlier. One commenter added the necessity to consider the ecological sensitivity
of the Waterfowl Impoundment Area at the southern end of George King Road.

Verbal comments made during the workshop:
The participants did not have major comments about the land use designations, but there
were differences in opinion on the density. One commenter was opposed to the dense,
mixed-use development because those would bring more cars and congestion to the
corridor. Another commenter supported high density but believed the community needed
education about the positive aspects of high density and also needs to develop a concise
vision to guide development. Another commenter suggested that, besides density, access,
time, and distance should also be considered when developing the ¼ and ½ mile radius
transit centers.

Other
Summary of written comments submitted on comment cards and by email:
Participants submitted comments unrelated to the above topics. One commenter was
concerned that this plan covers two counties and the implications of that for economic
development. The commenter was particularly concerned with the tax burden on
residents for non-residents to use the park and ride and free bus transportation. Another
commenter continued to advocate for an alternative southern route around Chapel Hill to
alleviate traffic coming from Chatham County, where development is occurring rapidly
and from where a significant amount of traffic is entering the corridor. A comment was
made that the proposed scenario seems to favor the needs of UNC over the residents
living along the corridor, and another echoed that sentiment, stating the need for someone

                              Workshop 3 Public Comments
to advocate the needs of Durham residents. Another commenter stressed that the
assumptions guiding the study were made by "outsiders" and not submitted by residents
in the corridor.

One commenter suggested lowering the speed limit to 35 mph on NC-54 to reduce the
regional utility of the Corridor (thus reducing traffic) and would, to some degree, address
safety concerns.

One commenter made this statement: "I would be very interested in knowing not only
about congestion in general but I would be especially interested to know the duration of
rush "hour" under the various scenarios that were considered and how they compare with
the scenario that they decided upon in the third Workshop, with the superstreet
arrangement. I hope that when the final scenario is presented to the governing bodies and
the TAC, these interesting data will be made available. I would expect others with a more
pragmatic view, including those underwriting the Study, the local citizens and the
commuters also to be interested in what congestion will look like in the future, and how
the Study plan will address this issue. In summary, how long will rush hour last with the
superstreet plan and how will it compare with the duration of rush hour associated with
the other plans considered? I honestly feel totally out of the loop as far as what to expect
from these plans and sense that a catastrophe is within the realm of possibility.
Consequently, to protect the folks who live near the Corridor and those who use the
Corridor, it seems appropriate that the final Corridor Study plan should include a
moratorium under which there will be no development in the Corridor until after proven
capacity for handling the increase in associated traffic is made available."

Another commenter stated, "What does one experience as they exit the interstate and
enter Chapel Hill? With exceptions at the strip malls, for the most part, there is a relaxed,
comfortable rural feel. This helps keep down the road rage which can at times be aroused
by the traffic. Along the Corridor, there are numerous neighborhoods and offices close to
NC54, but for the most part they are screened by landscaping. A noticeably different
view is presented by my neighborhood, Eastwood Park. There is no effective barrier
between Eastwood Park and NC54, and with the widening of NC54, the highway will be
quite close to homes there. A theme universally utilized in all kinds of design, be it
interior, landscaping, architecture or whatever, is continuity. There needs to be an
effective level of landscaping/hardscaping between Eastwood Park and NC54 to confer a
sense of continuity to the corridor. This is one of the few areas of the corridor where
utility wires on telephone poles are prominently displayed. These wires/poles are not
attractive, and the landscaping should be "beefy" enough to hide these from view. Aside
from the esoteric contribution, a consistent background (that is, landscaping such as that
seen across the highway, at Falconbridge), would make it less distracting for NC54 traffic
maneuvering through intersections or a superstreet."

This Appendix incorporates the full set of public comments received during the NC-54/I-
40 Corridor Study project. They include the comments recorded from the focus groups
conducted at the beginning of the process, comments recorded from each of the three
public workshop activities, a follow-up development focus group, and comments emailed
to the project team throughout the process.

    Creekside Elementary brings in commuters from several areas of the state and is the
    cause of some traffic problems in that area.
    One participant asked if 54 East is designed to connect to the rest of the region. The
    project team responded that it was developed at a planned regional transit station.
    A participant noted that another transit station is planned at the Meadowmont/Friday
    Center location on NC-54.
    UNC stated that the school provides less than 50% parking for its employees and less
    than 10% parking for its students. The University is very focused on sustainable
    growth and development and believes in sustainability as one of its driving forces.
    UNC acknowledged that the Friday Center park-and-ride lot needs to be pushed back
    to the I-40 interchange and that the rail and transit infrastructure needs to be
    developed and strengthened.
    UNC stated that it's not the student population that drives growth, but research and
    research funding. This most often happens in the medical fields, which is why
    providing parking or access for UNC employees is crucial to the University.
    The project team should look at the University's 1999 Master Plan.
    One participant stated that there is not consensus on where the rail line from RTP
    should be extended first ­ Durham or Chapel Hill.
    SW Durham Drive should be a focus point in the study area because it will be the
    next big development. The study should consider any impacts 54 will have on that
    development, as well as potential impacts on the 54 corridor when SW Durham
    Drive is developed.
    Durham did a charette of the Leigh Village area. The study should take a look at
    those results.
    NCDOT did a study of the I-40 interchange about 6 years ago. Contact Jim Dunlop
    for that study.
    Talk to UNC's MAB for the geocode and other origin and destination analyses.

   From a healthcare patient's perspective, it's important to understand that hospital
   staff commute from all over the region; that access and parking are major deterrents
   to staff hiring and to patients going to the hospital; that the hospital has good parking
   and transit; that roadway and interchanges are improved; and that emergency
   vehicles have easy access through traffic, especially to SW Durham.
   Jordan High School's location has posed many traffic problems, especially for
   neighborhood residents in the area.
   15-501 is really bad and UNC can't relieve some of the traffic issues by putting a
   park-and-ride on 15-501
   Any transit near the I-40 interchange needs to have direct access off the highway,
   probably in the Leigh Village area.
   One problem route is UNC employees leaving the campus, picking up students at
   Creekside Elementary, and then trying to get onto I-40.
   You should take a complete streets approach to 54.
   You should provide viable recommendations that are fundable ­ have a good
   financial plan.
   You should have short- and long-term roadway improvements, such as turn lanes and
   signalization.
   You should raise the level of education on what the long range plan for the corridor
   is and provide a really good map.
   You need to connect Chapel Hill transit with the rest of the regional transit systems
   and provide the steps we need to take to get here.
   I want to see improved traffic flow and transit opportunities along 54.
   You should provide a phased plan that viable economically.
   The plan shouldn't just consider people entering into Chapel Hill, but also account
   for the best ways to get people out of Chapel Hill.

Neighborhood/Environment Focus Group

   Farrington/NC-54 intersection is a big traffic problem. Coming from I-40, turning
   left onto Farrington is very hard. The left-turn lane is short and it's hard to cross over
   2 lanes after getting off I-40 to get into that lane. The problem is the worst in the
   evening, during rush-hour. The alternative route is 751 Stagecoach, however, there is
   a lot of traffic and congestion on that road since there are no traffic lights to control
   the traffic. One suggestion for traffic control on Stagecoach may be a roundabout at
   Farrington at Stagecoach.
   You need to look at routing traffic onto 751 Stagecoach and off of NC-54.
   Now, people are going through the Falconbridge neighborhood instead of going onto
   751 Stagecoach. Thus the neighborhood receives continual traffic. While the



                                             2
NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study   Compilation of Public Comments                          7/08/10


   neighborhood is mostly empty-nesters and there are few children, the traffic speed is
   still a concern. The neighborhood will probably need speedbumps in the future.
   If you figure out some traffic calming methods for the neighborhoods, we would be
   willing to maintain some accesses, for example Rogerson Road near Glen Lennox.
   The group thinks that roundabouts, while they are hard to get used to in the
   beginning, are a really great solution. However, size is important. The Pittsboro
   Courthouse is a good example of a successful roundabout. The Erwin and 751
   Roundabout is an example where a roundabout doesn't work well.
   Connections were supported by residents as something they would like in order to
   stay in their neighborhoods and stay off of NC-54. Falconbridge neighborhood
   voiced concerns about connections in light of future development around their
   neighborhood and the fact that they are landlocked in other surroundings.
   It's interesting to note that development on Farrington has all occurred in the past 15
   years, but the Farrington/I-40 intersection has not changed at all.
   If there were bike lanes into UNC, people would bike/walk more. Same into Durham.
   Sidewalks right up on the road are a safety issue, the sidewalks need a green buffer.
   Underground access is an important option to consider. In Portland, there are several
   bike routes underground.
   Biosoils
   Participants voiced sewer drainage concerns. For example, storm water from Friday
   Center side of 54 is drained into the Celeste Circle neighborhood on the other side of
   54. Want to see stormwater run-off controls.
   Instead of taking wetlands mitigation elsewhere, keep it in this area.
   The problem with speed bumps is the wear and tear on tires and the constant speed
   change.
   2-lane streets, on street parking, and winding roads is the best way to control traffic
   within neighborhoods. Glen Lennox is a good example of this strategy.
   Other traffic calming technologies are speed tables or green zones where, if you drive
   a specific speed limit, drivers will hit all green lights.
   Need more one-way streets.
   Towns keep okaying development in isolation, but there is no aggregate through over
   time. The infinite reservoir theory needs to be applied to the roads. There is a
   saturation point in Chapel Hill.
   Need to constrain traffic on 54 to the airport. There are many commuters on 54
   heading to the airport who could use transit instead.
   Another strategy to accommodate bike/ped users is having lights at intersections turn
   red all ways ­ such as at C and C.
   Would like to see a TTA rep at the workshop.

   Would like to see enhanced bus or BRT along the corridor.
   Can you do a cost-benefit analysis of having park-and-ride lots off I-40 and buses
   running along 54 that service those lots?
   One participant does not think people would tolerate bus and HOV lanes along 54
   because most people commuting into UNC are from Orange County and Orange
   County is very rural and get little bus access.
   Need a park-and-ride lot somewhere on I-40 along the rail line.
   Carolina North will change the dynamics of 86.
   Need a dedicated ramp off I-40 to a parking deck.
   Don't need to do much to 54.
   Need buffer space somewhere near golf course.
   Chapel Hill doesn't want to widen roads.
   Shared parking with shopping centers has been discussed but has not been well
   received.
   Connecting SW Durham Drive from South Hills Mall in Durham to 54 would reduce
   traffic on I-40 and 15-501
   Density-focused development talks should also consider water availability. However,
   one participant noted that OWASA would have the capacity to support several high-
   density developments.
   We want to see design conditions spelled out, such as the need for sidewalks, trees,
   buffers, etc. We do not want any "in lieu of" language. The design conditions must
   be required, not optional.
   One idea is to morph the 15-501/54 intersection to a more street-centered design and
   then, moving down 54, change the design. The corridor does not have to have the
   same look and feel the entire way down.
   The most important issues to tackle are the ramps from NC-54 onto I-40 and 15-501.
   Air Quality is an issue to look at.
   There is no currently-planned rail connection from UNC main campus to North
   Campus. Rail connection is important between these two campuses and should be
   there.
   The transit circulation should not just focus on transportation people to Downtown
   Chapel Hill or UNC, but also to other UNC places.

Transit Focus Group

   A political will is necessary in order to tie down the details of the corridor legally.
   Then, leaders need to definitively say where the transit stops will be and need to take
   a stand to say that development will only happen when it supports transit.

   Transit operators and previous studies have spoken and the results are out there.
   HOV study has been done. The balance is when new technology is introduced too
   soon and is premature to the system.
   We should build the high-density infrastructure, let people incur the problem of
   traffic until they realize transit is the answer. We can't hold off on high-density just
   because the transportation support isn't there just yet.
   Developers have said they are willing to have dedicated transit as an interim solution.
   The problem with the traffic on the corridor is that it stems fro ma variety of trip
   destinations. Any transit network solutions has to be wider, and not just for the
   corridor.
   You should consider the job opportunities along the corridor and the entertainment
   options. Things like sporting events will impact how you develop the transit
   infrastructure. It needs to respond to the ever-changing schedule due to the
   University's game-day and other special events schedules, such as extending service
   routes and times.
   Walkable centers make sense.
   Land use is an issue, especially in surrounding areas such as RTP. If RTP becomes a
   little more residential and less commercial, it will impact the trips to and from Chapel
   Hill.
   Now is a good time to engage the transit system boards, but these boards are more
   advisory groups, not decision makers. The actual decision makers are the city
   councils, so it's important to get them on board.
   Currently, there is some coordination between the area's transit systems, but it could
   be better.
   One idea for coordination is some kind of transportation smart card system that
   allows people to use the same payment source for all area buses.
   Steve Spade is the director for a program currently underway to coordinate the TTA,
   CAT, Chapel Hill Transit, DATA, and Robertson buses ­ the schedules, the
   payments, and the routes.
   To encourage transit and attract choice riders, the system needs to be frequent and
   reliable.
   A measure of good frequency is to go between Durham and Chapel Hill in 30
   minutes.
   Other important destinations are the airport and RTP.
   Express service between Durham and Chapel Hill is very important for the
   commuter, but transit service also needs to provide for stops along the way for
   residents and local travel. Both types of services are needed.
   70% of people working in Chapel Hill are coming from Durham, thus a Durham
   connection is crucial.

   The new transit station in Durham is the ideal stop in Durham for the Durham
   connection.
   Express lanes for buses are a good idea.
   Besides service and routes, transit considerations must include the condition of the
   buses and the services offered on the buses.
   Density development should be part of the plane.
   Sidewalk infrastructure needs to be improved.
   The 54 corridor needs a connected bicycle/pedestrian path all the way down.
   Crossing 54 is difficult, and there are a few places where pedestrians may wish to
   cross: Barbee Chapel, Downing Creek, Falconbridge.
   Other structures for pedestrians may be bridges or underground passes.
   We need to determine what the ultimate character of the street is.
   You need to plan in sound barriers for when traffic increases.
   We are open to the idea of 54 changing character from one end to the other. It makes
   sense. And the floodplains and drainage swamps provide natural separation barriers
   for the change.
   54 has to have mixed-used density in order to grow successfully.
   If you create a design that accommodates bike/ped where the path is set back from
   the road, it creates an aesthetic view.
   Consider bike park stops, separate from bus stops, to help bicyclers on long rides.
   Parks and Rec might be a good group to work with, because they might have ideas
   and funding for some of the bike/ped infrastructure.
   If you put the focus more on the connector roads and less on the one major arterial
   (54), you may open up more places for bike/ped to get around within the corridor.
   One participant brought up crime-rate issues with high-density development and
   asked if anyone else had mentioned it. The project team replied that no one had
   brought up crime.
   One participant said that another important issue is pinpointing which agency will
   have responsibility for roadway maintenance for express bus lanes.

Bicycle/Pedestrian Focus Group

   People would love to ride bikes from Durham to Chapel Hill if they were provided
   safe access.
   NCDOT does not speak willingly about bike/ped and has not embraced urban streets
   and bike lanes. The agency needs to acknowledge that streets are different and need
   to accommodate a wide variety of transportation vehicles.

   The 15-501 and NC-54 intersection is very dangerous and is not accommodating to
   bicyclists and pedestrians.
   One avid cyclist would rather go through other connector roads than try to bike along
   54.
   The issue is how to get different modes to co-exist because each mode feels it is
   entitled to the right-of-way. The participant does not believe the modes can co-exist
   and feels that any bike path should be separate from the road.
   Need to look at the adopted trails and bike plan.
   Get Meadowmont trail system connected.
   I-40/NC-54 interchange is a huge problem.
   There is no road going north-south that is a good bike path unless you weave through
   the neighborhood roads.
   The neighborhood roads are very wide and feel safe. They would probably still feel
   safe even if traffic increased.
   With higher density along the corridor, one participant expressed concerns for transit
   service along 54.
   Have shoulders on secondary roads.
   Improve bike infrastructure with bike locks at stores and facilities or along the routes
   near transit stops.
   There is a concern that any widening of lanes brings increased speed and
   environmental impacts.
   The group agreed the corridor is not suitable for seniors because it is not a walkable
   area. While it may not be a problem for future centers to be walkable between one
   another, the centers themselves should be walkable.
   Need grade separated crossings (tunnels, overpasses, etc) and at-grade facilities.
   The pavement surface is an issue. Coming down 54 away from UNC, bikes have a
   difficult time riding on the road because of the sewer drains.
   Take the American Tobacco Trail and use that as a connector for bike ped, instead of
   trying to bring it down NC-54.
   Improve the bike/ped and transit connections ­ several neighborhoods are within 0.5
   miles of the Friday Center, but because there isn't any transit service to those
   neighborhoods and NC-54 is too dangerous to bike/walk down, people drive that
   short distance to park at the Friday Center, thus contributing to the congestion on 54.
   Need a connection to Durham across I-40.

Business/Developer Focus Group

Travel on NC-54 Corridor:
 There have been lots of improvements to the NC-54 and Farrington intersection. It is
   now a lot easier getting in and out of the shopping center with the Shell gas station.
    However, further down NC-54, the traffic is very bad, especially the rush-hour traffic
    in the afternoon.
    The Barbee Chapel and Farrington Road alternative is popular, but the traffic there
    will get worse as more people use that alternative to 54.
    The roads parallel to 54 do not seem to impact the businesses at all ­ they just serve
    the neighborhoods.
    The park-and-ride lots, such as the one at the Friday Center, are part of the
    congestion problem on 54. Commuters using those park-and-ride lots are clogging up
    those arteries because they are still accessing 54. The park-and-ride lots keep traffic
    away from downtown and the University, but bring traffic onto 54. Especially in the
    afternoons, you see cars turning right out of the Friday Center, heading toward I-40 ­
    this is where a huge bottleneck is. There should be park-and-ride lots for commuters
    coming from Durham, on 15-501, and perhaps even down I-40. This would reduce a
    lot of the traffic using the I-40/NC-54 intersection.

Development in the area:
 Any development down Farrington Road is going to impact 54. This should be
   considered in the scenarios.
    The study must pay attention to sites of high impact, such as the Glen Lennox
    development. The developers of Glen Lennox are open to different development
    ideas and would like to see what alternatives are developed.
    A concern is shopping centers and businesses maintaining direct access onto 54.
    When developing future scenarios, you cannot get rid of access to 54, like from
    Farrington Road.
    You should look at previous instances where development close to the main road
    hasn't reduced the amount of traffic on the road, but actually is creating more traffic
    problems. One example is the development at Barbee Chapel and NC-54.
    There is a market for walkable, mixed-used development in this area, according to
    some, but not all the developers.
    Glen Lennox developers are looking into a multi-modal development, although some
    developers feel it will not reduce the traffic impacts on 54, but increase them.
    To move toward multi-modal development, the area would need a strong mass transit
    system. Light rail might not be the answer, but definitely a bus system.
    Participants agreed that there is a significant market for age-friendly developments.
    However, there are barriers to overcome. Down Barbee Chapel, in the Downing
    Creek neighborhood, there is interest in non-automobile trips, but there is no bus

    service down that neighborhood. Same with Greenbridge and downtown Carrboro.
    Furthermore, in an East-54 development, realtors and developers are having
    problems because the age-friendly developments are priced higher than "normal"
    development. To really have age-friendly developments, you need more reasonable
    prices and a good transportation system in place.
    There needs to be education about density-filled development. Teach citizens about
    examples like Detroit and ??

Alternative forms of transportation:
 Any light rail stations will impact 54.
    There is a lack of awareness about carpooling. Perhaps if HOV lanes were
    introduced, either on I-40 or even NC-54, people would be more aware of the
    benefits to carpooling.
    Participants agreed that an HOV lane of 54 might be well received by people.
    Area businesses have employees commuting from all over, including Hillsborough
    and Clayton. Employees may be more receptive to carpooling, but on a personal
    level, the commenter likes having her car available should emergencies arise.
    While some places are very bicycle-friendly, in other places in Chapel Hill, it is just
    not safe to bike or walk on the roads. This discrepancy across the area is not
    conducive to promoting bikability or walkability.
    Studies by a developer group has found that coupling trips with retail does not
    happen as much. The most obvious focus for transit should be work to home trips.
    The same developer has found that there is a big benefit to co-occupation parking in
    mixed-used developments.
    Erwin Road is now a very busy, straight road. It used to be frequented by bicycler
    commuters coming from Durham into Chapel Hill, but it is too dangerous to ride
    bikes on that road now. It needs a bike lane.

Funding Comments:
 One of the challenges to the area planning organizations and governments is how to
   connect and fund connections between Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill.
    There is a bill being pushed in the General Assembly that would authorize a local
    half-cent sales tax dedicated to bus and rail service (HB 148 and SB 151). Several
    different organizations (asphalt folks, Sierra Club, Durham Chambers) were all
    behind the bill.
    You should get buy-in from the Home Builders Association for private road
    development because it's difficult and time-consuming to obtain funding from DOT
    or the state.
    Chapel Hill is heavily taxed, so any additional taxes will be a hard sell.

Miscellaneous Comments:
 It's hard to talk about impacts or the future if there isn't a plan to respond to.
    One option may be to force alternative transportation or restrict vehicular traffic to
    wean people off of driving.
    The study should who is using 54, is it mostly local residents or is it commuters?
    This may impact how development goes. If private roads are designed to discourage
    travel on NC-54, you may find pushback from neighborhoods who do not want thru-
    traffic on their streets.
    Is it possible to get another ramp onto I-40?
    At the intersection of 15-501 and NC-54, it's one lane. This makes traffic difficult in
    that area, which may be why so many people use 54 instead of continuing on 15-501.
    Perhaps if the lane was widened, more people would use 15-501.
    Cedars neighborhood across from Meadowmont is interested in pedestrian
    development.
    There is a limit to what you can require developers to do. One developer was
    required to put in a pedestrian bridge between a neighborhood and a shopping center
    and has not seen any use of the bridge. The developer does not feel that particular
    requirement was useful. However, if careful community input is considered and
    planning done to determine the most useful pedestrian crossing sites, developers may
    be open to them.
    Look at what the public tax-base benefits are. Money talks.
    Do an Origin and Destination study.
    Will you look at the air quality implications?
    Why has Triangle Transit reduced the number of stops? Has it also reduced the
    number of routes it offers?

UNC Commuter Forum            (October 8, 2009)

    How can we get people to use TTA buses to reach Chapel Hill instead of filling up
    all the CHT and UNC Park & Ride lots? The NC 54 lot in particular is full by 7 or
    7:30 most mornings (and the UNC Friday Center lots fill up shortly thereafter).
    Many of the people using these lots on 54 are coming from the 15-501 corridor
    (Durham), and would be better served by better transit service in that corridor.
    Building more park and ride lots is not necessarily the answer.
    Can try to divert some park and ride trips to the Eubanks Rd and Chatham County
    lots (which are less full). Peak hour headways on MLK bus routes are comparable to
    those on NC 54 (every 10 minutes)
    Chapel Hill Transit recently completed a 2035 Transit Plan ­ they are looking at the
    possibilities of improved bus service (perhaps even BRT) between UNC main
    campus and Carolina North ­ are there possibilities for this type of improvement in
    other corridors?

Workshop 1 Comments                                         November 18, 2009
During Workshop 1, eight to 10 participants sat at each table. Following the presentation
and map exercise, the participants were encouraged to discuss what they saw as priority
issues, and develop a quick summary of the main issues that the study needed to address.
The table below shows the summary priorities recorded by each table.

Table 1     ·   Limited amount can be accomplished by improving NC 54
            ·   Future conditions and development outside the corridor (e.g. Carolina
                North) will determine the future of the corridor
            ·   Think about more I-40 interchanges
            ·   Park and rides should be away from interchange or there should be more
                lots
Table 2     ·   Bicycle/pedestrian/scooter/wheelchair lane from Farrington Road along
                collector lane to Meadowmont and into Chapel Hill
            ·   Safe all-purpose crossings along NC 54, from Farrington Road to 15-501
            ·   Shopping street along "New Farrington"
            ·   "Town Center" along north side of NC 54 between existing Farrington
                and George King
            ·   Widen NC 54, but in balance with non-car uses
            ·   Exit to I-40 from existing north bridge
            ·   Bypass from Southern Village to 751 or Fayetteville Road
Table 3     ·   Green space near NC 54
            ·   Alternate east-west routes both north and south of NC 54/I-40
            ·   Employment near Barbee Chapel Road/NC 54, with shuttle to nearby
                transit stops
            ·   High-density residential around Leigh Village transit stop
            ·   Maximize pedestrian and bike access and trails
            ·   Additional access to I-40 between NC 54 and 15-501
            ·   HOV on I-40 and lanes that change directions at peak times
Table 4     ·   Connect neighborhoods to reduce traffic
            ·   Relocate UNC Hospital to I-40/NC 54 intersection (near Transit Station
                1)
            ·   Expand and complete network of off-road greenways and bike paths from
                "inner" NC 54 out to I-40
            ·   Build southern east/west connector road to funnel Chatham traffic to I-40
                ­ somewhere south of this project's study area
Table 5     ·   Increase road capacity and add access points (an exit off I-40 to Ephesus
                Church Road, change Barbee Chapel Road to 4 lane to take traffic off NC
                54 heading into Chapel Hill)
            ·   Develop east side (Farrington Road side) of NC 54 with low density
            ·   Use express bus instead of rail. When relocating stops, use existing roads
                ­ don't build new tracks
            ·   Improve pedestrian/bike safety, perhaps by adding a lane?
            ·   Development close to UNC campus should be more mixed-use
Table 6     ·   Separate bike lanes from traffic lanes on NC 54 and connect the bike
                lanes to Meadowmont and beyond

           ·   More bike racks on buses and trains and connect bike lanes to transit
               stops
           ·   If there is increase in road capacity, then transit will be less likely
Table 7    ·   Density and mixed use at transit stops
           ·   Create neighborhoods and employment centers ­ places rather than stops
           ·   Hospital campus at the Friday Center and Barbee Chapel Road
           ·   More East 54-type development at NC 54/15-501 Bypass

           ·   Run rail along NC 54 ­ rail is essential
           ·   Preserve NC 54 and Farrington's full access
           ·   Consider sound barriers for residential areas along NC 54
           ·   Consider 4 lanes for NC 54 from I-40 to 751
Table 9    ·   Build out George King Road to NC 54 before projected housing build.
               Do not collapse Meadowmont Lane and Barbee Chapel Road
               intersections (as was done to Farrington Road).
           ·   Move transit station closer to Farrington Road/I-40 for ingress/egress to
               I-40. This makes access easier to a park and ride at I-40/NC 54.
           ·   Make transit line parallel to NC 54 to gain economies of scale in bridge
               system over creek and Corps land on the way to Meadowmont station
           ·   Connect bike/ped trails between the neighborhoods: the Oaks,
               Meadowmont, Downing Creek, Falconbridge
Table 10   ·   Reduce number of cars on NC 54 with a park and ride lot closer to I-40 ­
               have commuters exit off I-40 straight into the lot. This lot can also be a

           ·   Fix the I-40/NC 54 intersection
           ·   Need bike/ped crossing over NC 54 near Farrington Road
           ·   Need bus stops at the rusty signs on NC 54 at Falconbridge
Table 11   ·   Traffic through corridor is mainly off map
           ·   Alternate route from 15-501 to I-540 and RTP besides NC 54
           ·   Connect roads through area for locals, so they can avoid NC 54
           ·   Light rail is in the wrong place ­ it should go to Raleigh/RTP to relieve
               congestion
           ·   Funnel I-40 traffic off NC 54 using extra lanes, maybe toll roads, and
               cloverleaf intersection

Workshop 2 Comments                                                 February 25, 2010
The following sections summarize the comments that were provided by the workshop
participants, as recorded on their group workbooks, which were given to each table and
included a map and written description for each of the three scenarios and a list of
questions for the participants to answer.

As might be expected, there was a diversity of opinion among the participants in the
workshop. Relatively few tables noted any single one of the three scenarios as their
preferred scenario, although a few did--more commonly, the participants noted aspects
of all three scenarios that they liked or disliked. Some tables were able to arrive at
consensus conclusions, while others were divided on many issues. The comments from
Group 11 provide an excellent example of a divided group, where some participants
preferred low-growth and others preferred high-density in support of transit. While there
was not a unanimous consensus direction provided by the participants' comments, there
are several themes that arise in many of the comments, including:

    Several comments are in favor of a new interchange on I-40 to serve the Leigh
    Village area and a re-located park-and-ride lot; however, almost all of them also note
    that this interchange should not be built in a way that would impact Leigh Farm Park.
    There are also several comments against a new interchange, due to the impact it
    would have on traffic and development in that area, and the potential impacts to the
    park.
    One common theme is that increased density could be problematic if light rail is not
    constructed; suggestions provided on how to address this include keeping
    development densities low, widening NC 54 in all alternatives, implementing
    improved bus service, and constructing an alternate route to serve Chatham County-
    to-RTP traffic. Some comments also acknowledge that additional density and
    worsened congestion conditions could help promote transit ridership.
    Several participants noted the need to address bottleneck intersections, such as those
    at I-40, Farrington Road, and US 15-501.
    Several participants noted that the proposed light rail system should serve Research
    Triangle Park, RDU Airport, and other points to the east. There was not consensus on
    whether the light-rail route should go through Meadowmont, as currently proposed,
    or should go along 54.
    Several comments were provided in favor of creating additional satellite park-and-
    ride lots at locations such as Leigh Village, Gateway Center, and Southpoint Mall.
    Many commenters were in favor of widening NC 54 to six lanes, some even thought
    it was needed for Scenario 2. However, some commenters were against widening
    NC 54, citing either the increased density it would bring or the need to improve other
    alternatives first.
    Multimodal accessibility concerns were prevalent, whether it was for support of
    regional light rail, BRT, an improved bus regional service, or the need to incorporate
    a bike/ped system that would adequately serve those users.

    Several commenters favored the collector street network, but some voiced an opinion
    against the Meadowmont Lane portion due to the close proximity to a school. An
    equal number supported improving travel options through that area.

Group Workbook Comments
Participants in the workshop were seated at one of fifteen tables, and each table was
provided with a group workbook. In the first section of the workbook, the groups were
asked to generally comment on the transportation and land use scenarios that were
developed for the workshop, and were provided with a list of six questions to address for
each scenario. These comments were not limited to group consensus comments, and
could include individual comments. In the second section, participants were provided
with a large matrix, where they could make comments regarding elements of each of the
scenarios that they liked and disliked, comparing the scenarios to each other, and
providing guidance on their preferred scenarios. In this second section, individuals were
still welcome to write comments, but group consensus items were also noted, by
highlighting these in a different color in the workbooks--in the tables below, these
consensus items are noted with bold font.

Group 1
Comments on              1. We don't feel this scenario addresses Workshop 1 issues because all it does is widen the highway. It
Trend                    doesn't address alternate transportation, and is a stopgap measure.
                         2. The land use ­ especially the predominance of single-family ­ is good. Too much commercial use
                         would only add to the traffic. However, it also depends on the commercial type ­ if you have more
                         residential, grocery-type/support stores, that means people need to drive more.
                         3. Growth in Orange County, which is slow, does not support the building of more offices.
                         4. We are not in favor of widening the highway because the gridlock is at the endpoints (15-501 and 40)
                         and not on 54. Suggest bus "pull-offs" for loading/unloading on 54.
                         5. The amount of growth assumed in this scenario seems reasonable.
                         6. Like lower density. Dislike widening of highway idea.
Comments on              1. Concerned that light rail can't go through this area due to topography.
Scenario 1
                         2. Need more vegetation, especially in the mixed-use areas.
                         3. Keep higher density, smaller footprint around the transit hub.
                         4. BRT focus needed ­ concerned funding for light rail doesn't happen. The bus to light-rail linkage
                         needs to be spelled out, other people won't be incentivized to use the light rail. Is there going to be any
                         parking available at both ends of the light rail system? There needs to be. What does making 54 wider
                         "do" in this scenario? BRT should be able to move the people, mitigating need for such a wide 54.
                         5. The growth assumptions aren't reasonable if there isn't money for light rail. However, light rail is the
                         future, so if the planning doesn't "allow" for it, the region could lose out in the future.
                         6. Like mixed use. Dislike widening 54. Logical place for light rail is from Carrboro to Durham. Would
                         rather keep development small around the base, not spread out.
Comments on              1. Add bike lanes and ped crossings/paths concept to plans.
Scenario 2
                         2. If BRT is fully developed, redeveloping close to the road makes sense.
                         4. Need to see how well the HOV lanes are used before expanding them. Need to clarify that there is
                         direct access off I-40 to proposed Leigh Village park-and-ride for all vehicles ­ HOV lane and regular
                         lane.
                         6. Like that park-and-ride traffic will bypass the 54/I-40 intersection, but not at the expense of any
                         parking. Put a park-and-ride lot right off I-40 and connect it to light rail transit. Dislike taking any part of
                         Leigh Farm Park for development. Dislike road widening because of pedestrian crossing impact. Want
                         bike lanes as well as BRT.

Group 2
Comments on              1. This scenario does address workshop 1 issues. 6 lanes from Barbee to 40 going west is ok.
Trend
                         2. Prefer density development in downtown Chapel Hill rather than at Leigh Station or along the
                         corridor.
                         3. More housing.
                         4. What are the transportation improvements in downtown Chapel Hill?
                         5. The growth assumptions are probably too low.
                         6. Widening 54 to 6 lanes will result in the loss of a significant part of Oaks Condominium property.
                         This scenario stops at the Durham County line? Potential bottleneck at Chapel Hill/Orange County line.
Comments on              1. Any express bus stop along the corridor?
Scenario 1
                         2. The land use and development patterns in this corridor are reasonable and likely.
                         3. Density seems appropriate. Concerned about increasing density along this already over-used corridor.
                         4. Want light rail into downtown Chapel Hill, to DPAC, Durham Bulls Stadium, American Tobacco,
                         Duke, RDU, Central University
                         5. Growth assumptions are reasonable.
                         6. Like collector street network. Dislike widening 54 to 6 lanes ­ need clarify about flow of traffic
                         through the corridor. Dislike light rail through Meadowmont ­ realign along 54. If you do this, will you
                         still need to widen 54?
Comments on              1. To increase density to increase light rail, consider downtown Chapel Hill in the mix.
Scenario 2
                         2. Concerns about the safety of a light rail terminal so close to Glenwood School. Keep Glen Lennox
                         residential.
                         3. High density development should only be allowed with the guarantee of light rail.
                         4. Like collector street plan. Like additional exit off I-40. Want 6 lane 54 even with light rail.
                         5. Move light rail realignment along 54/George King ­ not Meadowmont Lane. (not everyone agrees)
                         6. Like 3 new park-and-rides to disperse traffic. Like Leigh Park interchange, but preserve park if
                         possible. Concerns with additional development at Friday Center.

Group 3
Comments on           1. Does not address: safety issues along 54, zoning land use, funnel-flow not on Farrington and exits
Trend                 273A and B, tax base increase or change in Orange County (i.e. maintains status quo).
                      2. More commercial in Orange County. Not realistic land use and development patterns.
                      3. Need higher density.
                      4. Transportation improvements don't fit scenario.
                      5. Growth assumptions are not reasonable.
                      6. Not a realistic scenario.
Comments on           1. Better than trend. Does not address: congestion at 273A and B off I-40 (suggest ramp from I-40 exit
Scenario 1            273A over I-40 and straight to park-and-ride at Leigh Village and suggest vertical separation of BRT at
                      54 intersection) and bringing enough commercial development to Chapel Hill (increase mixed use and
                      density).
                      2. Not dense enough in this area. Move Finley Golf Course to Carolina North and turn into walkable
                      dense use ­ "mixed" and green space.
                      3. More commercial, especially in Orange County.
                      4. Bus system needs to match LRTP. Grade separation along 54.
                      5. All scenarios too low in population and jobs.
                      6. Doesn't fix Farrington Road to I-40 funnel. Six lanes on 54 won't solve problem. 54 grade separation
                      might be a solution for some scenarios.
Comments on           1. This scenario is best of the three. Move ramp from east side of I-40 to west side, at proposed Leigh
Scenario 2            Village. Avoid sensitive area.
                      2. Free up Finley Golf Course for other uses. Modest density, mixed use, transport.
                      3. Utilize 2010 census in future plans, or amend plan once census data is available.
                      4. Match bus system to LRP stop. Consider grade variances on 54. Consider overhead and underground
                      ramps north-south 54 (i.e., Meadowmont)
                      4. HOV flyover ramp makes sense.
                      5. Most reasonable growth scenario ­ still probably too low.
                      6. Like ramp to/from I-40. Move ramp (HOV only) north or south or to other side of I-40 if necessary to
                      preserve park. Consider schools in park. Make park more accessible.

Group 4
Comments on           Need on ramp at I-40 and Leigh Village.
Trend
                      1. Does not address workshop 1 issues at all. Removes some traffic off 54 but, increases volume on 54
                      to accommodate growth and may move congestion to other hot points.
                      2. Low density may be desired, but as a long-term solution, it's impractical.
Comments on           3. Utilize vertical mixed use along 54 corridor. Higher density along 54 and lower away from it. Better
Scenario 1            balance than trend scenario. A lot of green pockets to hide high density growth.
                      4. Still need new southern transit routes (North Chatham/Southern Orange). Early and late schedules are
                      needed or rail/bus will not help UNC Hospital needs. Transportation improvement don't fit scenario.
                      75% of traffic on 54 is transit (passing through). There must be no increase in traffic lights. Focus on
                      bottlenecks (40 and Farrington). Coordinate traffic lights.
                      5. Growth assumptions on Durham side seem reasonable. On Chapel Hill side, there is more high density
                      not reflected in the study area (i.e., Carolina North).
                      6. Like light rail and may allow non-drivers to move in or access UNC/businesses, etc. Dislike that it
                      changes the complexion of the neighborhoods/area.
Comments on           2. Mixed use at Meadowmont too far from transit station.
Scenario 2
                      3. Vertical mixed use/high density is good. Force mixed use.
                      4. No new interchange at designated location (ridiculous). No interchange period ­ utilize existing 54
                      and 15-501 efficiency. Move interchange to Farrington Road. Need southern access to 40 from south
                      Orange County/north Chatham county.
                      5. Growth assumptions reasonable fro Durham. More growth expected in Chapel Hill outside study area.
                      6. Dislike that it negatively changes complexion of community neighborhoods.

Group 5
Comments on        Maintain tree canopy and existing roads in Glen Lennox.
Trend
                   1. Present infrastructure ignored by current collector street proposal. Will infrastructure be moved to fit
                   Leigh Village? It appears proposed collector streets are there to accommodate Leigh Village.
                   2. Many "yellow" areas will be much denser ­ not realistic.
                   3. Celeste Circle should be commercial.
                   4. Collector streets don't connect well to 54. Where will the lights be? Too many to work? These
                   transportation improvements do nothing to fix double left turn lanes at Friday Center (which are
                   underutilized). Traffic from Barbee Chapel left to Chapel Hill is not addressed. Consider extra lane on
                   Barbee Chapel for Chatham traffic. Widen Farrington? Why not route Falconbridge homeowners over to
                   Farrington Road?
                   5. Several single family areas likely to be much lighter density than shown on plan (i.e., much shown as
                   single family is currently commercial).
                   6. Don't understand what's really changing. Dislike that it's not an accurate starting point. Bradford
                   Place is residential condos, not office. Yellow spot on Barbee Chapel is already rezoned for townhouses,
                   not single family.
Comments on        1. Existing infrastructure ignored (traffic lights, etc).
Scenario 1
                   2. Hamilton Road construction area a mess. It should remain residential.
                   3. Land use types are more realistic than trend, but no consensus in group whether this is good or bad.
                   Glen Lennox as mixed-use is inconsistent with probable designation as NCD.
                   4. No good access from built up Hamilton Road area. 4 lanes on Barbee Chapel to support higher
                   density. Can we handle peak load? Collector road connections to 54 still not addressed.
                   5. Some like high density growth assumptions along 54. Others will like Woodmont will be the final
                   straw in traffic failure on 54.
                   6. How to get to transit stop at Leigh Village. Need to pull park-and-ride off 54.
Comments on        1. With Woodmont increasing traffic, you are not addressing traffic issue between 40 and Barbee
Scenario 2         Chapel. But still need to widen 54 to 6 lanes. Collectors to 54 continue to ignore existing infrastructure.
                   2. Sherwood Forest is not likely to sell out any time soon. Glen Lennox as apartment/condo is
                   overdevelopment that is inconsistent with probable designation as NCD.
                   4. School traffic is challenging with HOV placement, although additional I-40 access is a good idea
                   between exits 270 and 273 towards Farrington Bridge.
                   6. Like park-and-ride relocations, HOV lanes, and new I-40 interchange, but don't impact Leigh Park.
                   Other suggestion: Toll road on 54 with nearby free ride for local traffic and higher toll at peak
                   hours ­to encourage the use of transit and encourage off-set traffic schedules for mixed use areas.

Comments on              2. Makes the 54/I-40 interchange problem worse.
Scenario 1
                         4. Improved transit (light rail and express bus), but no parking facilities to support. Park-and-ride
                         facilities should be available on edge of corridor and east side of I-40. Bus service should be seamless
                         and integrated between Chapel Hill and Durham.
                         6. Like additional busing and light rail. Dislike that the scenario does not adequately reduce congestion
                         at I-40/54 interchange.
Comments on              2. One person does not like high density because it will add to traffic on 54.
Scenario 2
                         6. Concerns about the location of the interchange for I-40. There is a need for additional access to I-40.

Trend                    makes pedestrian safety less likely. Multi-modal, but it makes no apparent improvement.

Comments on              1. Pretty well, but even this option is too dense.
Trend
                         2. Eliminate commercial development at Farrington/I-40 bridge near Ephesus Church Road.
                         3. More low density residential.
                         4. Transportation improvements fit the scenario. Do not like connector from Farrington to Nottingham.
                         HOV and 54 widening are enough; HOV is actually overkill.
                         5. Growth assumptions are reasonable.
                         6. Like lower densities and no negative impact on Leigh Farm Park. Dislike major sites of community
                         importance, like Creekside School and Leigh Farm Park are not noted on the map.
Comments on              1. Not well, light rail requires densities that are inappropriate. If light rail occurs, it should follow 15-
Scenario 1               501, between Durham and Chapel Hill.
                         2. Land use and development patterns are too dense.
                         3. Land use types are too dense.
                         4. Eliminate light rail.
                         5. Growth assumptions are overly high for an environmentally sensitive area.
                         6. Dislike impact of Chapel Hill-driven agenda that is forcing high densities onto Durham and that Leigh
                         Farm Park and Creekside School are not noted on map.
Comments on              1. Doesn't address workshop 1 issues at all.
Scenario 2
                         2. Land use and development patterns too dense in the extreme.
                         3. Land use types too dense.
                         4. Scenario is inappropriate.
                         5. Growth assumptions far overblown.
                         6. Dislike that Leigh Farm Park not noted and the interchange on top of Leigh Farm Park.

Comments on              Does not address thru traffic from Chatham County.
Trend
                         2. Concerns about Southwest Drive. Land use and development patterns not optimal because goes
                         through existing development. Development is big enough to support investment, but must ensure
                         infrastructure.
                         3. Some mixed use in undeveloped areas.
                         4. Invariably more cars.
                         5. Some say growth assumptions are reasonable, others say not.
                         6. Like single family density. Dislike lack of mixed use.
Comments on              1. Does not address thru traffic from Chatham County. Rail works for UNC and Duke, but not
Scenario 1               east-west to RTP. None of the themes, issues, and opportunities from Workshop 1.
                         2. Soft edit for high density development "density gradient" ­ concern with impact on lakes.
                         Disagreement on whether high density can protect water quality. Concern about low price housing.
                         4. Bus transportation is good. Concerned about strip development. Transit stops are too close.
Comments on              Does not address thru traffic from Chatham County.
Scenario 2
                         3. Problem with building up to get transit dollars. If we don't get it, then you are stuck in traffic.
                         6. Dislike interchange's Leigh Farm impact. Protect New Hope Corridor ­ Ephesus Church to
                         Jordan High School is not safe. Additional park-and-ride lots are good. Significantly more

Trend

Comments on              1. This alternative fairly addresses workshop 1 issues.
Scenario 1
                         2. Land use and development patterns viewed as favorable. Would like to see slow growth.

Comments on Trend        1. Would prefer 54 to stay 4 lanes to reduce VMT and to encourage development of light rail.
                         3. Offices on Farrington Road will exacerbate traffic problems at the intersection with 54.
                         4. Fits every scenario like SW Durham Drive and other Durham connectors. What provisions are made
                         to make the roads acceptable for public transportation/buses?
                         5. I think this is on the low end for 2035.
                         6. Like that it keeps Eastwood Park residential. Leaves congestion at stoplights, especially around
                         Falconbridge Road and I-40.
Comments on              2. Intense development makes 54/I-40 interchange worse. Traffic lights increase congestion.
Scenario 1
                         4. Transportation improvements help, but traffic will still get worse, especially at intersections (54-
                         Farrington-40).
                         5. Growth should be predicated upon first constructing the traffic infrastructure.
                         6. Like commercial near light rail station in Leigh Village and like Meadowmont lane. Dislike that
                         Eastwood Park becomes commercial; it should stay residential. Need park-and-ride on 751 near I-40/54
Comments on              3. Place commercial around light rail rather than around 54 to encourage use of rail vs. more strip malls
Scenario 2               and drive-thrus.
                         4. The transportation improvements help but still will probably have traffic congestion, especially at
                         intersections. Need to improve intersections.
                         5. Would like to have road/rail infrastructure first, then if there is capacity, development.
                         6. Like satellite parking-and-ride, especially at 751. Dislike Eastwood Park as commercial, keep
                         residential.

Comments on           2. This is a "business-as-usual" vision. Does not take advantage of the strategic location of Leigh Village
Trend                 to accommodate growth in the area between Durham and Chapel Hill.
                      3. Seems like there are more jobs being added via mixed-use development. Development likely to be
                      very slow due to the high cost of infrastructure (Water and sewer) with little incentive, if there's low
                      density residential.
                      4. Improvements come short ­ already have problems at I-40/54 interchange. 54 and Farrington Road
                      will not handle increased commuter traffic and the intersection of Farrington, 54, and I-40 are currently
                      inadequate for increased commuter traffic.
                      5. Scale of growth is unreasonable ­ numbers are too conservative.
                      6. Like low density and residential vision.
Comments on           2. Like the walkable, small grid around the light rail nodes.
Scenario 1
                      3. Mixed use center on both sides of 54 should be better integrated into light rail path.
                      4. Need to figure out southern connection to Farrington Road across 54. Currently, it appears to route
                      through residential streets. Meadowmont Lane extension could become dangerous due to increased
                      traffic through the residential area. New collector streets through Meadowmont will become very
                      burdened by traffic from light rail node traffic moving toward Chapel Hill. Widening 54 is a necessity,
                      especially if collector streets are dumping traffic onto 54. If Farrington Road is still a major artery
                      (collector streets dumping traffic onto it), then the Farrington/54 intersection must be improved. A
                      second access from Farrington to 40 is needed close to Trenton Ro. Seems this scenario is trying to use
                      both rail transit and improve highways for cars and buses ­ in which case, highways will win and rail
                      will be under-utilized.
                      5. Growth assumptions are reasonable. Population density may not be such that it would justify rail
                      transit unless at the high end.
                      6. Like path of light rail.
Comments on           3. Near Leigh Village, more density towards the transit station, so greenspace can be preserved. Potential
Scenario 2            for more high-tech businesses, medical facilities.
                      4. Not happy with I-40 flyover and cloverleaf (half). Do not want Leigh Park land used for this.
                      Extension of Meadowmont to SW Durham Drive will reroute traffic from I-40 through Meadowmont,
                      past school, in order to avoid congestion on 54 (especially when only 4 lanes). Creating a new
                      interchange opens up more problems than it solves. What about transit access near the Friday Center? A
                      second intersection of Farrington Rd and 40 at Trenton Road would really help relieve traffic on 54,
                      especially if you keep 54 at 4 lanes. More park-and-rides are good, especially close to the transit station,
                      but it could be north of the transit station and accessible from both Farrington/54 intersection and my
                      proposed new intersection at Trenton Rd. This may eliminate the need for fly-over access and reduce
                      impact on Leigh Park.

Focus Group with Business and Developers                                       5/4/2010
In order to test the draft Blueprint concepts in a real-world context, a follow-up focus
group was held with members of the real estate, development, and design community.

Q = question
A = answer by project team
S = statement/suggestion

Plan feedback to incorporate
S: You should suggest a minimum threshold for density to ensure that the future
development density supports transit.

S: You need to have interim density ratios. The current guidelines are too low without the
transit infrastructure in place to support that density. Without those interim ratios, you
might actually slow down development. Another solution is to have an agreement in
place that, at the parking lots at the transit stations, once the transit is available, some of
the parking spaces will be available for commuters.

S: You should talk to the people who purchased land around Barbee Chapel Road
because they have a land use plan that is not as supportive of transit as your blueprint.
A: We request that you send us their information so that we can get in touch with them.

Q: By the Farrington transit station, will the parking structure be such that people can go
there and park for long periods?
A: We understand the need for a sizable parking structure at that station; both residents
and the Town of Chapel Hill want structured parking.
S: This is an ideal place to do a TIFF financing plan.
A: We will add a line about TIFF in the Blueprint report.

Q: Are there any changes to the traffic pattern or access to Leigh Village?
A: (There was a lot of discussion and concern around this topic.) We are considering
closing southbound traffic on Farrington from crossing over NC-54 or turning left toward
I-40. Traffic going northbound on Farrington would be able to turn left or right onto NC-
54. If you come off I-40, you will be able to turn right onto Farrington, but to turn left,
you will have to travel down the corridor and make a U-turn. This would be a super street
concept using a diverted diamond interchange strategy. However, we are still considering
other options and may end up proposing two different options and listing the pros and
cons of each.
Several participants were concerned with this solution. They were told that access onto
Farrington would not be affected, but this new solution does that uphold that statement.
Concerns center around access to Harrington Bank and Nantucket Café, specifically,
especially if people are traveling eastbound on NC-54 and are no longer able to turn left
onto Farrington Road. The project team reiterated that the reason for such changes was
to improve congestion and amend for the traffic problems caused by I-40 and Farrington
Road interchanges being too close. The project team also mentioned that, while this
solution might restrict some access, the complete Collector Street plan and any

new/additional development that results from more connected streets means those
business on the north end of Farrington might get business from new developments in the
north.

Q: In the mixed-used slides, why are you not showing more mixing of residential and
office?
A: These pictures are just examples. We are not proposing any specific numbers in the
design.
S: You are overstating the demand for office space; I do not think future demand will be
that high, especially with how flexible employers are about workspace (telecommuting,
extended hours, etc).
S: The Town of Chapel Hill just completed a study about the retail and office needs.
There is still a lot of retail opportunity still available, but office space demand is limited.
A: The project team will include in their statement about mixed-used that the
developments should be flexible in the type of space they offer.

Q: Are you making recommendations toward affordable housing developments?
A: We may produce general guidelines or targets set by other areas. We think it is
important to consider how workforce housing might influence affordable housing.
S: Also, the floor area ratios you are proposing should encourage developers to include
affordable housing in order to meet the ratio numbers.

Q: Are you concerned that the Friday Center and Meadowmont transit stations are too
close together?
A: While the placement is not typical or ideal, we are trying to serve two different
communities that are separated by significant division (NC-54). We might include an
elevated walkway between the two stations or end up combining the stations into one.
However, having only one station in this area makes it difficult for pedestrians to walk to
certain localities.

S: Any architectural guidance in the plan should be more form, not design. It could
include window placement and where parking should be located, but do not tell architects
how to design the buildings because each location has its own character and is very site-
specific.
S: I agree but think that the plan should allow for flexibility in the form. For example,
allow some front-of-the-building parking. Do not try to make everything "one size fits
all."

Other plan feedback
Q: Are the concepts in this plan contingent on getting light rail funded and implemented?
A: While the project team was charged with developing a blueprint that assumes light rail
transit is a given, the opportunities in this plan are possible with other transit alternatives
in place.

Q: Will this plan cause codes to change?

A: The intent of this plan is a blueprint for changing the codes. However, each
jurisdiction will proceed separately and has its own process, which will dictate if any
codes change.

Q: East of I-40 on NC-54, at the Quadrangle Complex, does this plan have them at lower
density?
A: We expect that their density will increase in the future, but we do not have them at
capacity right now.

Q: Are you proposing any transportation changes?
A: We are proposing more lanes to NC-54, possibly as early as 2020/20205.

Q: What about additional access between I-40 and 15-501?
A: Out of the picture ­ the residents are strongly against this.

Q: At the adoption phase of this project, will the approvers be going down to a Master
Plan-type level and look at more specific numbers, concerning traffic counts and
analyses?
A: We think they will lay out key principles and guidance for the area, but will not go
more specific than that.

S: As development begins, you must make sure it is balanced, in terms of placement. If a
residential area is over-developed but there is no retail to support it, the development will
not succeed. You need a balanced mechanism.
A: We are doing a phasing plan, which basically lays out what things need to be in place
before other things can move forward.

The number of respondents was low, compared to the actual number of participants who
attended the third workshop. Generally, these level of agreement responses are skewed
towards "strongly opposed" and "opposed," but three statements were especially
weighted in opposition: #5 - bicycle and pedestrian improvements will solve critical
problems, #6 - the roadway improvement strategy will improve vehicle travel, and #8 -
the roadway modifications support traffic growth.

Also, while the number of participants who "agreed" or "strongly agreed" was generally
in the 26-31% range for most statements, only 13% of respondents "agreed" or "strongly

agreed" with the statement about bicycle and pedestrian improvements solving critical
problems (#5). This highlighted the need to provide more details about recommended
pedestrian and bicycle improvements in the Blueprint master plan.

The workshop participants were also encouraged to submit their comments in response to
the elements in the preferred scenario. Below are the comments participants submitted on
comment cards, comments submitted by email, and spoken comments made during the
workshop.

Light Rail Transit
Summary:
Many commenters advocated moving the light rail transit line out of the environmentally-
sensitive area between the Leigh Village site and Meadowmont. The commenters suggest
running the line parallel to NC-54. Several others did not want the LRT line to run
through Meadowmont, based on the proposed development and park and ride lot
locations. Many comments indicated that light rail must be in place before dense
development should begin. Two commenters saw the light rail as promoting growth in
the area, which those commenters did not want. Commenters stressed the need to connect
the LRT line to Chapel Hill, Durham, RTP and RDU Airport. One commented stated that
the light rail is located in the wrong place to alleviate east-west traffic because I-40 does
not have the capacity for high-speed buses and the FAA has always resisted HOV lanes
or dedicated bus lanes.

Detailed Comments:
- LRT parallel with NC-54 (4)
- introducing rail increases growth; I want less growth
- build light rail from I-40, down 54 through UNC campus ­ this would solve some
congestion.
- move light rail transit line to along NC-54 and out of an environmentally sensitive area
(2)
- need to encourage less traffic and more mass transit in currently non-congested areas
- LRT through Meadowmont doesn't make sense based on proposed development and
park and ride lot locations (3)
- need rapid transit to encompass RTP, Chapel Hill, Durham, Raleigh, etc
- light rail must be under construction before accompanying density can occur (3)
- Here are some alternative solutions to road capacity increases: Obviously, a rail line
down the middle with be fabulous, provided it had connections or at least to a park 'n ride
lot at Interstate 40. But I know how resistant CH has historically been to rail.
- The transit improvements are not adequate to support the new development. This
gateway to Chapel Hill adjacent to I-40 will become impassable to commuters driving
through the area (about 70%) and to the surrounding neighborhoods. The proposed plan
seems to say the situation is bad now, so let's improve it by allowing greater amounts of
development. It is unrealistic to assume that the solutions offered will more than off set
the increased traffic brought by the new development.

- It appears that the light rail is located in the wrong place to alleviate east west traffic. I-
40 does not have the capacity for high speed busses and the FAA has always resisted
HOV lanes or dedicated bus lanes.

Comments from the workshop:
One commenter asked if safety along the transit line was considered for the transit
centers, since density was going to be so high and the goal was to make it very walkable.
Another commenter was concerned with the current proposed alignment of the light rail
because it runs through ecologically sensitive area. That person wondered if the light rail
could run along 54. A last comment questioned if light rail was contingent on Wake
County, Orange County, and Durham County all giving their approval.

Mass Transit and Park and Ride Lots
Summary:
Many commenters were against the proposed park and ride lot near Falconbridge
neighborhood, at the wastewater plant, stating that it could cause dangerous traffic issues
in that neighborhood and would exacerbate traffic problems at the NC-54/Farrington Rd
intersection. One wondered why a park and ride was proposed on Farrington Rd, when
the superstreet concept would essentially close Farrington Rd at the NC-54 intersection ­
suggesting that people would be motivated to cut through the Falconbridge neighborhood
rather than back track around Barbee Chapel in order to go to points east or to gain access
to I-40.Another comment believes Farrington Road would become more congested with a
park and ride, as well as with the addition of a transfer station in the Falconbridge
Shopping Center. While the intention would be for commuters to park in the Park &
Ride, the commenter thinks commuters will opt to park closer ­ in the shopping center at
the corner of NC-54 and Farrington Road and on the streets in my neighborhood. They
will cut through the neighborhood to reduce congested areas, and to avoid the traffic
patterns created by the Super Streets. Commenters suggested locating the park and ride
lots east of I-40 and NC-54, along the highway, and out of the corridor. One commenter
included the caveat that shuttle service be provided and coordinated to serve both Chapel
Hill and Durham. Other suggested locations included Southpoint Mall and New Hope
Comments. This suggestion was supported by a commenter who felt the proposed park
and ride lot at Leigh Village would only serve to benefit UNC and would actually hinder
traffic flow because, regardless of how commuters accessed that park and ride, the traffic
into the park and ride would create a bottleneck because it would be coming off I-40. One
commenter stated that the proposed NC-751 park and ride lot would not logically serve
Chapel Hill. In general, participants recognized the need for a more robust transit system
that would serve Chapel Hill, Durham, RTP and RDU Airport, among other locations.

One commenter suggested installing bus-only lanes on NC-54 to improve traffic flow
during rush hour in the morning and evening.

Detailed Comments:
- charge people to park if they are not from Orange or Durham counties.
- put mass transit facilities/park and ride lots in more strategic areas, such as near
Southpoint Mall and New Hope Commons

NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study    Compilation of Public Comments                         7/08/10


- the 751 park and ride lot is not logical to serve Chapel Hill, maybe it should only serve
Durham
- no park and ride in the Falconbridge neighborhood
- the Friday Center should take care of its own traffic and have a park and ride and its
own bus system. Should consider requiring carpools or at least giving them priority.
- park and ride lot on Farrington is a poor idea. Makes congestion problem worse by
moving traffic to intersection of Farrington and 54. Feeds traffic into Falconbridge to
bypass congestion, which is dangerous for the residents.
- encourage park and ride outside of 54 corridor; what is an incentive for people to
change?
- need more mass transit to RTP and 40
- park and ride lots should be east of I-40 and NC-54 (2), not in Leigh Village or
Farrington
- park and ride on Farrington and the transfer location in the Falconbridge shopping
center will have serious negative impact on the Falconbridge neighborhood and will
exacerbate the traffic problems at Farrington and 54.
- shared parking is a good idea, but need to think about the regional draw required by
certain retail businesses in order to survive
- Install bus only lanes on NC 54 off of the traveled road way for buses to pick-up and
drop off passengers. This would greatly improve the flow of traffic into Chapel Hill
particularly during the morning rush hour. Several additional bus only lanes to pick up or
drop off passengers are also needed on east bound NC 54. (There are actually 2 such bus
only pick-up/discharge lanes East bound on NC 54 now.) So the idea is to get buses off of
the traveled road way when they pick up or discharge passengers.
- Here are some alternative solutions to road capacity increases: Add park and ride lot at
NC54 and Interstate 40 with shuttle to campus from there (would obviously need to be
coordinated with Durham)
- If Farrington Rd is ultimately going to have to be closed at 54, than why put a park and
ride on it? Doing so will surely motivate people to cut through the Falconbridge
neighborhood rather than back track around Barbee Chapel in order to go to points east or
to gain access to I-40.
- The plan appears to locate new park-and-ride lots for UNC employees in Leigh Village.
There were also other lots outside the corridor I believe on route 751 and around
Southpoint Mall. Park-and-ride lots for UNC employees seem to be heavily used and
valuable transportation elements. However, the park-and-ride lots in Leigh Village
would not improve the transportation system and more likely would be an impediment to
improved traffic flow. Why do I say that? Consider a commuter using the park-and-ride
lot at Leigh Village. Consider how they exit and enter NC54 when accessing that lot. It
doesn't matter how they do it, whether it's through the current Farrington Road, or a
rerouted Farrington Road, it is going to be near I-40, which will slow traffic flow near
intersections that need all the help they can get to flow more smoothly. Also, if there is a
superstreet, all of those turns onto and off of NC54 into or out of the superstreet will
challenge its capacity. In summary, why relocate a park-and-ride lot to a location (Leigh
Village) where commuter traffic to and from the lot will pass through a bottleneck? If
park-and ride capacity at the Friday Center must be relocated, it would best be relocated
to somewhere in which traffic does not have to slow and turn in a bottleneck area, such as



                                            54

the vicinity of Southpoint Mall area or route 751, somewhere outside the Corridor to keep
individual commuters outside of the Corridor.
- I live in the Falconbridge neighborhood. All of the recommendations that increase
traffic around the 54/Farrington intersection will, in my opinion, negatively impact my
neighborhood. Farrington Road would become more congested with a park and ride
located on the property owned by the city of Durham, as well as with the addition of a
transfer station in the Falconbridge Shopping Center. While the intention would be for
commuters to park in the Park & Ride, I think they will opt to park closer ­ in the
shopping center and on the streets in my neighborhood. They will cut through the
neighborhood to reduce congested areas, and to avoid the traffic patterns created by the
Super Streets. I've lived in major metropolitan areas close to such transfer hubs, and this
is what occurred. Safety is a major concern. The community clubhouse and swimming
pool is adjacent to Farmington Rd, which is the street that wraps around the back side of
the shopping center. Members walk and bike to the clubhouse. Children bike in. The
traffic patterns will make this unsafe. Ultimately, what I want is for traffic to be caught
about 5 miles before they reach the area, and redirect them through currently
undeveloped areas. I agree with others at the meeting who want traffic funneled AWAY
from the area, rather than into it, exacerbating the traffic issues instead of easing them.
Put the park and ride and the transfer stations off of 751 by the car dealerships where
there is open land.

Comments from the workshop:
Participants focused mostly on the park and ride lots proposed on Farrington and near
751. One commenter thought the Farrington park and ride would cause a lot more traffic
issues on NC-54 and another asked whether impacts of the increased traffic on Farrington
Road had been analyzed and accounted for. The comment about the park and ride lot near
751 supported it, believing that it would relieve some of the traffic heading to 54.
However, another commenter said that people wouldn't use that park and ride because
they would not want to travel out of their way instead of heading straight into Chapel
Hill.

Bicycle and Pedestrian
Summary:
Participants were divided over the proposed bicycle and pedestrian system. While many
supported the enhancements and felt they addressed the needs of the bike/ped
community, others felt that the improvements were not enough, and still others did not
believe there are enough users to support enhancing the system.

Safety was a major concern on all fronts. Participants took issue against the proposed
separated bike lane dividing the right turn lane and through lane near the 15-501
interchange, stating safety concerns. Others advocated for bike lanes or paved lanes
separate from the main road or wider and "protected" lanes. One commenter supported
the bike lanes and their enhancement to safety, especially on the eastern side of the
corridor.

NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study     Compilation of Public Comments                         7/08/10


Several comments asked to link the bike trail to the American Tobacco Trail in Durham
and RTP. Others suggested a trail to connect Eastwood Park with the nearby proposed
transit center. Another requested bike routes along Barbee Chapel, Farrington,
Stagecoach, NC-751, Scott King, and Massey Chapel roads because of the number of
commuters who bike that path from Chapel Hill to RTP.

Detailed Comments:
- link bikeway to American Tobacco Trail to Durham and RTP (3)
- having a bike lane in between the turn land and the thru-lane is a horrible idea
- using bike lanes for traffic calming creates a safety issue
- the bicycle and pedestrian system in the proposed scenario is not adequate or enough to
solve problems at critical locations
- bicycle and pedestrian system improvements are a waste of money because you will not
increase the number of system users
- like the east/west bicycle and pedestrian system improvements, if they preceded
developments
- the north/south bicycle and pedestrian system improvements are very poor
- need overpasses/underpasses, especially over I-40 on both sides of NC-54
- prefer wider and "protected" bicycle lanes
- bike route from Leigh Village to the mall on 15-501 looks great
- proposed bike lanes are very dangerous
- not enough planned to encourage system users and proposed plans are not safe
- improve underpass from Friday Center to Meadowmont and the drainage issue (2)
- 15-501/54 intersection proposal very unsafe. (3) Too much time and effort focused on
bicycle traffic, which benefits very few residents. Adding an extra lane obviously
increases complexity in an already complex area. Removing bicycle drivers from the
traffic flow for a short distance only to attempt to re-integrate them is fraught with
conflicts. The appropriate operational maneuver for bicyclists is to use the full right lane.
Motorists change lanes to pass. This behavior can be encouraged with appropriate signs.
- elevated crossings are not conducive to bikers
- need bicycle/pedestrian walkway from Eastwood Park to the rail station nearby.
- need to be offset from 54
- need bicycle land or paved path on Durham side of 54 (east side)
- trying to accommodate bicycles and sidewalks through the 15-501/54 interchange is a
waste of money.
- if bicycle lanes are added on 54 before traffic issues are addressed, cars will likely use
bicycle lanes ­ a huge safety issue
- protect bike paths using medians or have them off the street in shoulders on both sides
of the road
- I am aware of numerous semi-regular bike commuters who travel to work at FHI from
Chapel Hill. Our current route is via Barbee Chapel / Farrington / Stagecoach / NC 751 /
Scott King/ Massey Chapel. Adding a bike lane or widening the roads would be a major
upgrade to the Chapel Hill system. It is much safer and more pleasant to bike from
Durham to RTP!
- The planned facilities for bicycle and pedestrian traffic within the eastern Corridor
should enhance safety. The last person I know of killed in the corridor was a bicyclist

riding westbound on the shoulder. They were hit in the back of the head by the rear view
mirror of a bus as they traveled in the vicinity of the "Welcome to Chapel Hill" sign.
Currently the shoulder is narrow and dangerous for bicyclists and pedestrians.
- I appreciate the work to look at bicycle connections. The on road bicycle connections
need to be wide enough to be safe from high speed traffic. Many cyclists would not dare
to ride between two traffic lanes as depicted. More attention needs to be paid to how
people will cross these imposing highways.

Comments from the workshop:
There was opposition against the dedicated bike lane near the 54/15-501 intersection.
People believed it would not be safe for bikers and would not be used. People do use the
underpass to cross 54 near Meadowmont. Before major changes are made on the road to
facilitate pedestrian crossings, commenters encouraged study on the use of the underpass.
A commenter stated that the bike/ped path proposed to University Mall may not work
because that path is very wet. Another commenter asked if the bike/ped path in Little
Creek will connect to the American Tobacco Trail.

Roadway Enhancement/Superstreet Concept/NC-54
Summary:
There were numerous concerns about the "superstreet concept", including accessibility
issues, impacts to neighborhoods, and lack of addressing congestion problems.
Commenters referred to the existing superstreet at 15-501/Erwin Road and mentioned
how it did not improve traffic conditions and has made it worse at times. Commenters
were skeptical of how it would improve vehicle travel along the corridor and how it
would support future traffic growth. Commenters were concerned with the impacts on
access to neighborhoods and retail areas along NC-54. One commenter was concerned
with the impacts on safety to bicyclists and pedestrians traveling along NC-54 Many
participants who were against the superstreet concept advocated the use of flyovers
instead. The fact that it would be an interim or short-term solution designed to be a cheap
alternative to the long-term solution was also a point on contest.

Some commenters did support the "superstreet concept" and believed it would alleviate
some of the congestion issues in the corridor. Support was shown for the proposed
designs at major intersections. One commenter stated the need for dedicated merge lanes
at the U-turn areas for the concept to succeed. Another commenter suggested looking at
allowing vehicles to go straight across 54 from any of the side streets, but continue
forcing left turns to U-turn.

Some commenters stated the need to widen 54, even up to 8 lanes. However, one
commenter stated that the problem is "peak time" travel problems, where the congestion
only occurs during morning and evening rush hours. This commenter believed travel
demand management strategies, not road widening, would address congestion issues.
This commenter was also concerned with the environmental impacts from widening NC-
54. This commenter provided several alternatives solutions: including 1) add one HOT
lane in either direction for carpoolers (charge SOVs for use of the lane); 2) work with

UNC to stagger employees' shifts so that employees enter and exit the corridor at
different times; and 3) increase parking fees at UNC campus

Detailed Comments:
- superstreet is insufficient without a dedicated merge lane at U-turn areas.
- roadway improvement strategy will make vehicle travel along the corridor worse
- roadway improvement strategy will not support traffic growth in the corridor
- roadway improvement strategy will create traffic growth
- prefer elevated flyovers, etc to superstreet concept
- unrealistic to what is here now
- are insufficient
- roadway modifications will support traffic growth in the corridor, which is what we
don't want
- cannot be practiced as studied when in actual use
- this concept will kill the retail
- widen 54 (3) to 8 lanes
- need flyovers and not this proposal, which will only postpone the inevitable at a much
higher price
- you can't cut off the south side of 54 with all these superstreets
- not a practical solution; emphasis mass transit and park and ride lots near the highway
- need new grade-separations at 54 intersections and move forward with Collector Street
Plan
- follow superstreet concepts ­ current access to/from on both sides of 54 absolutely
means superstreet concept is correct at the major intersections (15-501/Erwin Road
superstreet concept works fine and is a great improvement) (2)
- proposed expansion is too large for current space
- appears to penalize local existing residents
- use more roundabouts
- will need education
- flyovers do work
- proposed interchanges are unclear
- may have adverse impacts to residential areas of Farrington and Downing Creek
- how long will these changes take?
- superstreet at 15-501/Erwin Road does not work. Commute has increased by 10 minutes
and public transit operators do not understand how to navigate.
- consider another version of the superstreet in which straight across is permitted but left
turns still require U-turn
- The problem on NC54 is a peak travel problem. Notice that during off peak hours both
sides are wide open. Thus, solution is traffic demand management, not road widening. If
you add more lanes, studies show you increase the number of lane changes, thus
accidents. Leave this stretch of sensitive watershed alone. Here are some alternative
solutions to road capacity increases:
         - Add one HOT lane in either direction for carpoolers. (SOVs are charged to use
         it; carpoolers are not)
         - Add park and ride lot at NC54 and Interstate 40 with shuttle to campus from
         there (would obviously need to be coordinated with Durham)



                                            58
NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study     Compilation of Public Comments                          7/08/10


         - Work with UNC to convince them to vary start/ending times more so that there
         isn't a mass entrance/exit at peak time. As it is, everyone gets out at 5 pm and
         thus the jam from UNC to Interstate 40 5-7 pm every weekday evening.
         - Again, this is a peak hour traffic problem. Why spend all that money increasing
         capacity so that it can accommodate 4-6 hrs. of traffic out of 24? Makes no sense.
         Rather, manage the traffic.
         - Obviously, a rail line down the middle with be fabulous, provided it had
         connections or at least to a park 'n ride lot at Interstate 40. But I know how
         resistant CH has historically been to rail.
         - Increase parking fees at UNC campus. Not politically attractive, obviously, but
         studies show that the availability of parking at one's destination is the factor that
         determines what mode a person takes to his/her destination.
- The super street idea does absolutely nothing for any Durham resident. The only thing
the proposed super street concept does is allow a faster flow of traffic in and out of
Chapel Hill for traffic coming from outside the corridor.
- I do have some experience with the superstreet structure in Chapel Hill on 15-501, and
have spoken with Chapel Hill residents about it. Overall from my unscientific survey
there seems to be grudging approval of the superstreet in Chapel Hill, although I doubt
whether a superstreet will be able to substantially mitigate the problems associated with
the traffic volumes on NC54 now and in the future. Consequently I do not see why
money should be wasted on what I would expect to be an infrastructure of modest
effectiveness. The other, long-range improvements presented at the third Workshop
seem to have more promise and money should be saved for these improvements. In
particular the flyover, in which eastbound NC54 traffic passes over the Farrington Road
intersection and then merges with eastbound I-40, seems to be a real solution that will
have a major positive effect towards easing congestion in the Corridor. The scale of the
flyover and its potential seem to match the scale of the late afternoon rush hour problem
which currently exists and will get worse. This long-term solution should be a priority as
it will have much more benefit than widening NC54 or creating a superloop. As
mentioned earlier, a Study such as this should run the numbers and present the data
comparing the benefit of the various possible solutions such as the flyover versus lane
widening etc.
- The proposed solutions are counter productive to the stated goal of increasing walking
and bicycle use. The super street solution is unattractive, would increase air pollution,
and would reduce walkability and bike usage. These unusual turning movements built
into a super street would make it dangerous to walk or ride a bike. If the structured
parking is moved out by I-40 by UNC, this will make it more difficult for commuters to
reach the hospital complex.

Comments from the workshop:
There were diverse comments about the superstreet proposal. There were several
concerns related to the actual learning curve, whether the superstreet actually reduces
wait time, if it was worth spending money on that improvement instead of other
alternatives, and if that improvement would actually encourage even more traffic on the
corridor. One person commented on their positive experience with the superstreet at
Erwin Road. One commenter suggested making the superstreet U-turn a dedicated lane



                                              59
NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study     Compilation of Public Comments                           7/08/10


for easy merging and so signals can be eliminated. Another solution was to have
dedicated lanes on 54 straight to 40 for cars that want to travel straight through the
corridor and a dedicated lane for cars that need to access side streets.

I-40/NC-54/Farrington Interchange
Summary:
Commenters provided suggestions to improve the interchange and varied widely. One
commenter suggested routing traffic via NC-751 to enter Chapel Hill; another suggested
a new I-40 exit at Ephesus Church Road or a new I-40 exit directly to the Leigh Village
park and ride lot; and another commenter stated the need for "overpasses or interchanges
to go north-south across I-40 from Farrington Road." Some commenters believed the
superstreet concept at this interchange in particular will not address or solve the traffic
issues and might bring economic harm to businesses at the intersection. Commenters did
agree that some kind of improvement was needed, and sooner rather than later. This
might be one of the first things to address in the corridor.

Regarding the proposed changes at this intersection, one commenter had this statement.
"The rerouted Farrington Road traffic will travel along a segment of what is now Celeste
Circle and will utilize the current Celeste Circle/NC54 intersection. Placement of the
rerouted road and widening of the Celeste Circle segment will require the removal of
several homes in Eastwood Park and an adjacent neighborhood. A prior developer of
Leigh Village believed that four houses would need to be removed. Remaining homes in
Eastwood Park would be adversely effected. For example, a couple of homes will end up
with a major road in their front yard and will be physically separated from the rest of the
neighborhood. Two reasons not to reroute Farrington Road are suggested here:
        - First, if the superstreet plan proposed by the corridor study is accepted, the
        current Farrington Road intersection will be largely atrophied, and the adverse
        effects of this intersection on traffic flow will be greatly reduced.
        - Second, there is an alternative to locating the road through Eastwood Park. It
        should be possible to move the planned intersection about fifty yards to the
        northeast. This would put the rerouted Farrington Road behind the northeastern-
        most houses on Celeste Circle, instead of in front of them. The exact location of
        this road is as follows. As one exits NC-54 and enters Celeste Circle, the first
        building on the right (on the corner of the Service Road and Celeste Circle) is the
        Dermatology Center/Urgent Health Clinic. To the right of this Dermatology
        Building is a space where the proposed road would be located. The next object
        past this space is the Carolina Crossing Building. Thus as one travels on the
        Service Road from Celeste Circle towards Farrington Road, one encounters the
        Dermatology Clinic, the space for a road, the Carolina Crossing Building (a
        commercial establishment), then other commercial/office buildings, and then
        Farrington Road. Although moving the rerouted Farrington Road several yards
        closer to the northeast decreases its planned distance from the interstate, it is still
        much further from the interstate than the current Farrington Road and seems a
        reasonable compromise considering the insult to Eastwood Park that would be
        avoided. This newly proposed path for a rerouted Farrington Road makes sense in
        the context of the superstreet proposal. It is noted that currently across NC-54

       from Celeste Circle is Falconbridge Road. In the superstreet proposal, traffic
       originating on the rerouted Farrington and Falconbridge roads is allowed to turn
       left or right onto NC54, and no left turns are allowed off of NC54 onto rerouted
       Farrington or Falconbridge Roads. Consequently it is not necessary for the
       rerouted Farrington and Falconbridge Roads to be aligned "head to head". The
       rerouted Farrington and Falconbridge Roads would be offset slightly (about 50
       yards), but would be so close that they would constitute a double T arrangement
       and stop lights at each intersection could readily be synchronized with one
       another. In order for the rerouting of Falconbridge Road proposed here to work, it
       would make sense to atrophy the current Celeste Circle/NC54 intersection, by
       completely blocking direct access between Celeste Circle and NC54. To
       recapitulate, the plan for rerouting Farrington Road proposed here will not require
       loss of residences or serious adverse effects upon residences in or adjacent to
       Eastwood Park. The only structure in the path of the route proposed here is an
       unused small distribution warehouse. In the context of the superstreet, the adverse
       effects of present and anticipated Farrington Road traffic on the Corridor would
       be mitigated by a combination of two mechanisms, the first being the partial
       atrophy of the current Farrington Road and second, the additional connection of
       the rerouted Farrington road which would allow left turns onto NC54 at a location
       significantly further from the interstate than the current Farrington Road/NC54
       intersection. The eastern end of the NC54 Corridor under study is challenging
       with respect to heavy traffic demands and the well being of local communities,
       and the Farrington Road plan proposed here is a reasonable compromise."

A business owner was particularly concerned with the traffic flow and economic impacts
to the shopping center off Farrington Road on the north side of NC-54. The business
owner stated that the additional lane on NC-54 to get onto I-40 greatly improved traffic
flow at that intersection, even on Saturday game days. A resident located off Farrington
Road echoed the traffic flow sentiments and was also concerned about the increase of
traffic on safety. That commenter said the community clubhouse and swimming pool are
adjacent to Farmington Rd, which is the street that wraps around the back side of the
shopping center. Members walk and bike to the clubhouse, so the increase in traffic can
have a major impact on local residents' accessibility to the clubhouse and swimming
pool.

A couple commenters were concerned that these drastic changes were first presented at
the latest workshop and that there was no prior indication that major changes were going
to be proposed fort the intersection. Commenters worried that the proposed changes were
made without any public input.

Detailed Comments:
- an additional interchange from I-40 directly for the park and ride will be required
- moving Farrington Road would help a lot and this strategy should start with that first
- not enough detail; need more from a conceptual standpoint before proposed scenario
can be determined as the solution
- try to get more traffic to enter Chapel Hill using the 751 entrance

NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study     Compilation of Public Comments                         7/08/10


- address this interchange ASAP
- this concept at Farrington will not work. Overpasses/interchanges are needed to get
north-south across I-40.
- superstreet concept will bring economic harm to all businesses at the intersection
- what about a new I-40 exit for Ephesus Church road to access into Chapel Hill
- Skip all of the interim steps that the consultants may come up with and immediately
start planning for and then building a new interchange at NC 54 and I 40. This could
several years, but it would reduce the overall cost to only do one permanent fix for the
problem.
- design and build a relocated interchange for I 40 and NC 54. I believe such a new
interchange could be build off of Farrington Road within 1/2 half mile of NC 54. To do
this you would then have to widen Farrington Road from the new interchange to NC 54.
- My concern about the recommendations are that they would greatly impede my
customers' access to Nantucket Grill & Bar, my employees' job security and my current
successful operation. I am concerned that any realized decrease in revenue would
negatively impact not only my main location at NC-54/I-40, but my entire chain of stores.
The traffic flow at NC-54/I-40 greatly improved with the new lane addition last year.
Traffic flows extremely well on football Saturdays to/from the game and there is rarely a
significant back-up. The daily traffic pattern from UNC has also improved greatly with
that new lane addition on 54. The proposed recommendations are not ones that I support,
as they would be very harmful to my ongoing business operation at NC-54/I-40.
- The rerouted Farrington Road traffic will travel along a segment of what is now Celeste
Circle and will utilize the current Celeste Circle/NC54 intersection. Placement of the
rerouted road and widening of the Celeste Circle segment will require the removal of
several homes in Eastwood Park and an adjacent neighborhood. A prior developer of
Leigh Village believed that four houses would need to be removed. Remaining homes in
Eastwood Park would be adversely effected. For example, a couple of homes will end up
with a major road in their front yard and will be physically separated from the rest of the
neighborhood. The plan to destroy the northeast end of Eastwood Park in this manner
was initiated in the Collector Street Plan several years ago, and has continued so far in
the Corridor Study. The reason that planners could morally justify a plan such as this is
that so far, the planners have considered Eastwood Park to be a place that is expected to
change in the future from a residential area to something else. However, the Corridor
Study, in its third Workshop, revealed for the first time that it believes the long-term land
use for the Eastwood Park area should be residential. Consequently it is imperative to
revisit the current plan to destroy this important part of an established neighborhood. The
reason to relocate the busy Farrington Road/NC54 intersection is to move it away from I-
40. The proximity of the intersection to the interstate restricts global traffic flow in an
area where efficient traffic flow is badly needed. Two reasons not to reroute Farrington
Road are suggested here:
         - First, if the superstreet plan proposed by the corridor study is accepted, the
         current Farrington Road intersection will be largely atrophied, and the adverse
         effects of this intersection on traffic flow will be greatly reduced.
         - Second, there is an alternative to locating the road through Eastwood Park. It
         should be possible to move the planned intersection about fifty yards to the
         northeast. This would put the rerouted Farrington Road behind the northeastern-

NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study     Compilation of Public Comments                           7/08/10


        most houses on Celeste Circle, instead of in front of them. The exact location of
        this road is as follows. As one exits NC54 and enters Celeste Circle, the first
        building on the right (on the corner of the Service Road and Celeste Circle) is the
        Dermatology Center/Urgent Health Clinic. To the right of this Dermatology
        Building is a space where the proposed road would be located. The next object
        past this space is the Carolina Crossing Building. Thus as one travels on the
        Service Road from Celeste Circle towards Farrington Road, one encounters the
        Dermatology Clinic, the space for a road, the Carolina Crossing Building (a
        commercial establishment), then other commercial/office buildings, and then
        Farrington Road. Although moving the rerouted Farrington Road several yards
        closer to the northeast decreases its planned distance from the interstate, it is still
        much further from the interstate than the current Farrington Road and seems a
        reasonable compromise considering the insult to Eastwood Park that would be
        avoided. This newly proposed path for a rerouted Farrington Road makes sense in
        the context of the superstreet proposal. It is noted that currently across NC54
        from Celeste Circle is Falconbridge Road. In the superstreet proposal, traffic
        originating on the rerouted Farrington and Falconbridge roads is allowed to turn
        left or right onto NC54, and no left turns are allowed off of NC54 onto rerouted
        Farrington or Falconbridge Roads. Consequently it is not necessary for the
        rerouted Farrington and Falconbridge Roads to be aligned "head to head". The
        rerouted Farrington and Falconbridge Roads would be offset slightly (about 50
        yards), but would be so close that they would constitute a double T arrangement
        and stop lights at each intersection could readily be synchronized with one
        another. In order for the rerouting of Falconbridge Road proposed here to work, it
        would make sense to atrophy the current Celeste Circle/NC54 intersection, by
        completely blocking direct access between Celeste Circle and NC54. To
        recapitulate, the plan for rerouting Farrington Road proposed here will not require
        loss of residences or serious adverse effects upon residences in or adjacent to
        Eastwood Park. The only structure in the path of the route proposed here is an
        unused small distribution warehouse. In the context of the superstreet, the
        adverse effects of present and anticipated Farrington Road traffic on the Corridor
        would be mitigated by a combination of two mechanisms, the first being the
        partial atrophy of the current Farrington Road and second, the additional
        connection of the rerouted Farrington road which would allow left turns onto
        NC54 at a location significantly further from the interstate than the current
        Farrington Road/NC54 intersection. The eastern end of the NC54 Corridor under
        study is challenging with respect to heavy traffic demands and the well being of
        local communities, and the Farrington Road plan proposed here is a reasonable
        compromise.
- Also, re-routing NC54 traffic to I-40 without crossing Farrington intersection would
help with much of the traffic jam and accidents there at peak times (which are
increasing). This would enable local traffic the convenience of Farrington intersection
and not hurt businesses there, and allow commuters a faster, more efficient way to reach
I-40.

NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study      Compilation of Public Comments                           7/08/10


- Anything you can do to reduce jamming on 54 from Downing Creek to Farrington Road
would be appreciated. Hopefully it can happen without routing lots of traffic through
Celeste Circle.
- I have yet to see how the study partners envision the way westbound NC54 traffic will
get onto Southbound Farrington Road. (a constant need) or northbound Farrington Road
traffic will get to the other side of NC54 to go further north on Farrington. (A U turn on
the eastside of the Interstate Cloverleaf?)
- During the first two workshops there was minimum discussion about a reference to that
intersection and there was no indication prior to the third workshop that there was going
to be a significant realignment of that intersection proposed as part of the draft NC-54/I-
40 Corridor Blueprint for Mobility Master Plan ("Plan"). At the beginning of the third
workshop there were a lot of people and some of the study staff congregated around one
of the posted items that turned out to be the recommendation or proposal for turning this
intersection into a Superstreet Intersection. There were very strong and even intense
feelings and comments about this, basically opposing it. In the previous workshops we
had not made this intersection a major discussion or input focus because there was no
reason to devote everyone's time and energies to this if there was not going to be any
recommendation of any changes to this intersection and certainly not the radical changes
now being proposed. TOPS is very concerned about any part of the Plan that
recommends de-emphasizing the Farrington Road-Highway 54 intersection by removing
existing traffic signals, eliminating movement through the intersection, allowing right
turns only and otherwise re-routing traffic from using that intersection, thereby limiting
access to its store from I-40 and egress to Chapel Hill or otherwise lessening, limiting or
actually restricting access and accessibility and mobility to is facilities at this intersection.
The concern is that such a radical and restrictive reconfiguration of this intersection
would confuse, frustrate or hinder existing customers and potential additional customers
from seeking to use TOPS' products and facilities at this location.


Collector Street Plan and other connecting streets
Summary:
Comments were generally supportive of the Collector Street Plan and wanted it
implemented soon. There were several comments of opposition to the currently-planned
alignment of Southwest Durham Drive via Meadowmont Lane, mostly because of its
close proximity to a school and a senior center. Instead, commenters stated that SW
Durham Drive should be connected to George King Road. However, one commenter
stated he heard from Meadowmont residents who attended the Collector Street Plan
Meetings that those residents felt that the Southwest Durham Drive connection to
Meadowmont Lane would be a plus in enhancing their choices for access to/egress from
their community. The commenter believed it would also provide an alternative for
pedestrian and bicycle traffic which might otherwise pass through the region of the Corps
of Engineers Land. The commenter also stated that, at the Chapel Hill town hall meeting,
the Transportation Department representative responded to a question by stating that
Meadowmont Lane had been constructed properly to serve its function as the southern
end of Southwest Durham Drive; thus this commenter believes this intersection, which is
about 9 lanes wide by 6 lanes wide would be a good intersection to use.

A direct connection to 54 from George King Road, and not through Crossland Drive, was
proposed by several commenters.

Commenters advocated that the Collector Street Plan preserve neighborhoods and not
channel traffic through them and deteriorate the neighborhoods. One commenter was
concerned about traffic impacts from funneling traffic down Farrington Road and
requested additional traffic studies to assess how that would affect traffic, access, and the
businesses. Another commenter proposed two alternative solutions: 1) Target the area
near the former Ecko warehouse ; or 2) reroute Farrington Road through King Highway,
currently a gravel road at the end of the Celeste Circle neighborhood.

One commenter focused on the area east of 15-501 Morgan Creek-Kings Mill and
suggested "moving the big roads below the ground" because the commenter was
concerned that the proposed addition lanes on NC-54 would "lock residents of the
neighborhood in."

Detailed Comments:
- putting an access system via Meadowmont Lane through to Farrington Road directly
interferes with the foundation and integrity of Meadowmont by changing a significant
amount of the area to essentially a convenient bypass for drivers.
- Meadowmont Lane should not be a connector road ­ too much traffic passing a school
and a senior center
- implement Collector Street Plan ASAP (2)
- reroute Farrington Road away from I-40 as a single collector street, not in multiple
portions
- Collector Street Plan should preserve neighborhoods and not channel traffic through
them (2)
- improvements to George King Road must consider traffic impacts to Creekside
Elementary
- SW Durham Freeway should connect to George King Road, not Meadowmont (2)
because 1) it's not built yet, so it can be done right; all new construction is east of Little
Creek, so keep arterial traffic on SW Durham Parkway east of Little Creek on George
King Road
- Crossland/Celeste Circle and 54 Service Road need to be taken out of the Collector
Street Plan, unless you want to buy our property
- Route George King Road directly onto 54. Do not use Crossland Drive. (2)
- keep SW Durham Drive through Meadowmont Lane, not Crossland Drive
- concerned with where traffic being funneled down Farrington will go
- based on proposed scenario, someone coming from Durham on 54 and turning right
onto Farrington Road will need to cut across 4 lanes of existing traffic to access the right
turn ­ this doesn't seem safe
- build George King interchange before superstreet at Farrington
- flyovers at George King Road intersection with arterial traffic from SW Durham
connected to 54

- A neighbor has made me aware of the proposal to re-route Farrington Road through our
neighborhood, specifically through the house two down from me and in front of my yard.
This is highly concerning to me since this would in effect cut me off from the
neighborhood, putting me on the other side of a busy road and isolated between
businesses and a major thoroughfare. Not only would this negatively impact my quality
of living and that of a long time established neighborhood, it would lower my property
value considerably. I do not see the feasibility of this plan when destroying a
neighborhood and homes in the path of the new route. The warehouse behind my house
has seemed to be vacant for some time now (former Ecko warehouse) and this seems to
be an area that could be targeted. Another option might be King Highway (gravel road at
the end of our neighborhood). I know little about traffic options, but I wonder if making
Farrington a bridge over 54 might be more effective than re-routing major roads.
- I am talking about the area east of 15-501 Morgan Creek-Kings Mill. Currently we have
2 lanes each direction, I ride my bicycle and it's doable to cross the road if you are fast -
the town council from Chapel Hill last summer was less courageous crossing the street by
foot. Now we see and hear discussions about adding lanes - meaning we are locked in or
make a big detour adding to more traffic. Thinking about unusual ideas: what would the
consultants think about moving the big roads BELOW the ground - it's a very common
solution in many parts of this country and in other countries. The current stretch of the
road could be developed thereby gaining land?
- It makes no sense to me to route George King Road to Crossland Drive. Why not pave
it all the way to NC54 along the current roadbed?
- During the third workshop, it was suggested by a participant that Southwest Durham
Drive not be connected to Meadowmont Lane, which is the current plan. The consultants
responded by saying essentially that the anticipated traffic on Meadowmont Lane that
would result from the connection would not be that bad. I think that the connection
makes a lot of sense because I learned in the Collector Street Plan Meetings that
enhanced connectivity reduces congestion. In this case the connection would result in
Meadowmont residents traveling less on NC54 and more on Southwest Durham Drive. I
attended the Collector Street Plan Meetings in several locations including a special
meeting held at Chapel Hill Town Hall. At these meetings I heard from a number of
Meadowmont residents who felt that the Southwest Durham Drive connection to
Meadowmont Lane would be a plus in enhancing their choices for access to/egress from
their community. I believe that it would also provide an alternative for pedestrian and
bicycle traffic which might otherwise pass through the region of the Corps of Engineers
Land which seems to be the most dangerous and tick-infested part of the Corridor. At the
Chapel Hill town hall meeting the Transportation Department representative responded to
a question saying that Meadowmont Lane had been constructed properly to serve its
function as the southern end of Southwest Durham Drive. This is easily seen in the
gargantuan intersection at NC54 and Meadowmont Lane, which is about 9 lanes wide by
6 lanes wide. It would be a mistake not to use this intersection.

Comments from the workshop:
Regarding the collector street system, participants had a few comments for specific
streets. The participants noted that the collector street designation from George King
Road straight down to NC-54 is wrong. The project team will correct the alignment.

There was major concern with one of the proposed connector roads behind the shopping
center ­ participants said that area was a neighborhood and a community pool and
shouldn't be a connector street and attract vehicles because it currently serves many
children and pedestrians. One commenter questioned whether the SW Durham arterial
road is coming to Meadowmont Lane and if it shouldn't connect to George King Road
instead, because near future development will be closer to George King Road. There
were many concerns expressed about traffic on Meadowmont Lane in the future and the
impacts it would have on the walkability of the community. A last comment urged
consideration of traffic impacts because of Chapel Hill's close proximity to RTP and the
travel patterns between the two areas.

Development
Summary:
There were several comments about the Leigh Village development, possibly because the
workshop group used the Leigh Village location to illustrate a possible high-density
transit center development. Commenters were concerned that Leigh Village was designed
solely to support light rail and that it would increase congestion. It was also seen as
unrealistic and encouraging unwanted growth in the corridor.

Specific Comments:
- extremely doubtful that Leigh Village will get enough transit to keep traffic manageable
with superstreet and lower-cost road changes, absent huge cost increase in gas.
- why build a community like Leigh Village? Is it only to support light rail, because it
seems like that will only increase congestion.
- why can't Leigh Village be lower density with more greenspace? It would contribute
less to the congestion.
- Leigh Village phasing needs to be tied to building the collector roads
- Leigh Village is unrealistic in the short term
- want slow growth
- developers shouldn't build if the roadways can't handle the traffic that such
developments will bring


Land Use Designations
Summary:
In general, commenters believed the land use designations were too dense and showed
high growth that the residential community does not support. The proposed density was
seen as unsustainable (especially at the Leigh Village development), only there to support
light rail transit, and unrealistic, and having adverse environmental impacts. There were
concerns about development near Farrington Road and how it might impact the senior
assisted-living facility in the area. However, some participants did support the transit-
supportive development and feel it will address future needs.

Another commenter felt the mixed used (tall buildings and retail on the ground floor) do
not necessarily bring foot traffic or the vibrancy that is described when located on vast
wide highways. Much of the area along 54 is low laying and adjacent to Jordan Lake, a



                                            67
NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study     Compilation of Public Comments                        7/08/10


major drinking water resource and the residents in this area depend on surface water for
their water supply. Chapel Hill and Durham should not be encouraging major increases in
building intensities so near buffer areas of Jordan lake, a drinking water supply for the
region.

A number of participants wanted Eastwood Park to be designated low density residential
and did not want to see any new roads introduced into the neighborhood. Another wanted
to see Eastwood Park incorporated into Leigh Village and yet another suggested turning
Eastwood Park into a parking garage and office complex to siphon some traffic off the
corridor earlier. One commenter added the necessity to consider the ecological sensitivity
of the Waterfowl Impoundment Area at the southern end of George King Road.

Specific Comments:
- land use is too dense
- transit improvements aren't enough to justify dense land use
- put Eastwood Park on the corridor study map as low density residential so that it can be
changed in Durham's Comprehensive Plan
- are unrealistic given what already exists
- did you consider environmental impacts, considerations for green construction and land
use, school, fire station, and police station locations?
- what is meant by lower-cost housing?
- Eastwood Park neighborhood should be incorporated into the Leigh Village
development
- maintain Eastwood Park as low density residential and do not introduce any new roads
into the neighborhood (7)
- the proposed scenario is structured for an urban area with a huge population. Any
development, particularly retail, is doomed with this forced approach, especially the
parking per square ft restrictions
- future planning must take into account the Palladian and Quadrangle office
parks/corporate centers that are immediately east of the I-40/54 interchange. Hundreds of
employees work in these locations and future development is anticipated in Palladian
(Leigh Farm Road)
- general correct concepts, but Leigh Village tapering to lower density is a suspect model
- Leigh Village concept is gigantic and not appropriate for Chapel Hill
- growth is currently not there, do not create it. you stated this is market demand for what
"might be desired" ­ but this growth is not desired by residents.
- proposed scenario seems to be forced to accommodate future light railway system.
- proposed density is unsustainable for this area
- need to limit density
- concerned with development near Farrington Road ­ keep senior assisted-living facility
in perspective. Too much development will cause further issues to existing residential
areas such as Downing Creek, unless road access improvements follow.
- transit-oriented communities are very progressive
- do not like the pro-development tone; while there will be some growth, it will never be
enough to support the proposed scenario developments

- turn Eastwood Park into a parking garage and office complex to ease traffic into UNC
and points west
- not enough attention paid to low-lying areas near wildlife impoundment.
- I just wanted to lend my voice to the chorus of support for Chris' proposals below, and a
general vote of support for switching Eastwood Park's future-use policy to residential.
As you know by now, many of the residents of Eastwood Park are committed to
preserving the neighborhood and its quality of life for the medium- and long-term future.
The only consideration I would add to Chris' items is the ecological sensitivity of the
Waterfowl Impoundment Area at the southern end of George King Road. As you are
probably aware, the land along 54 from that area and east to just before 751 was, prior to
human development, a low-lying wetlands akin to a swamp. Though this area has been
deeply compromised through the years, it still exists in enough fragments to support some
vestiges of an important ecosystem and the ensuing biodiversity. Further encroachment
into this remaining area will further crowd out existing species, while likely adding
considerable water runoff problems to existing and future development.
- The great preponderance of mixed use 2 is not justified. Tall buildings and retail on the
ground floor do not necessarily bring foot traffic or the vibrancy that is described when
located on vast wide highways. Much of the area along 54 is low laying and adjacent to
Jordan Lake, a major drinking water resource. We depend on surface water in our region,
not ground water, to serve the water needs of our cities. The Jordan Lake rules offer
some protections, but Chapel Hill and Durham should not be encouraging major
increases in building intensities so near buffer areas of Jordan lake, a drinking water
supply for the region.
- I am in favor of Eastwood Park remaining residential, that I am in agreement with the
alternate collector street route proposed by Chris Selby, and that I would also encourage
Durham to improve the area between Eastwood Park and Highway 54 with plants or
walls to buffer the traffic noise. This would be in keeping with maintaining the area as a
residential neighborhood and would help improve the quality of life in Eastwood Park.

Comments from the workshop:
The participants did not have major comments about the land use designations, but there
was differences in opinion on the density. One commenter was opposed to the dense,
mixed-use development because those would bring more cars and congestion to the
corridor. Another commenter supported high density but believed the community needed
education about the positive aspects of high density and also needs to develop a concise
vision to guide development. Another commenter suggested that, besides density, access,
time, and distance should also be considered when developing the ¼ and ½ mile radius
transit centers.

Other
Summary:
Participants submitted comments unrelated to the above topics. One commenter was
concerned that this plan covers two counties and the implications of that for economic
development. The commenter was particularly concerned with the tax burden on
residents for non-residents to use the park and ride and free bus transportation. Another
commented continued to advocate for an alternative southern route around Chapel Hill to

alleviate traffic coming from Chatham County, where development is occurring rapidly
and from where a significant amount of traffic is entering the corridor. A comment was
made that the proposed scenario seems to favor the needs of UNC over the residents
living along the corridor, and another echoed that sentiment, stating the need for someone
to advocate the needs of Durham residents. Another commenter stressed that the
assumptions guiding the study were made by "outsiders" and not submitted by residents
in the corridor.

One commenter suggested lowering the speed limit to 35 mph on NC-54 to reduce the
regional utility of the Corridor (thus reducing traffic) and would, to some degree, address
safety concerns.

One commenter made this statement: "I would be very interested in knowing not only
about congestion in general but I would be especially interested to know the duration of
rush "hour" under the various scenarios that were considered and how they compare with
the scenario that they decided upon in the third Workshop, with the superstreet
arrangement. I hope that when the final scenario is presented to the governing bodies and
the TAC, these interesting data will be made available. I would expect others with a more
pragmatic view, including those underwriting the Study, the local citizens and the
commuters also to be interested in what congestion will look like in the future, and how
the Study plan will address this issue. In summary, how long will rush hour last with the
superstreet plan and how will it compare with the duration of rush hour associated with
the other plans considered? I honestly feel totally out of the loop as far as what to expect
from these plans and sense that a catastrophe is within the realm of possibility
Consequently, to protect the folks who live near the Corridor and those who use the
Corridor, it seems appropriate that the final Corridor Study plan should include a
moratorium under which there will be no development in the Corridor until after proven
capacity for handling the increase in associated traffic is made available."

Another commenter stated, "What does one experience as they exit the interstate and
enter Chapel Hill? With exceptions at the strip malls, for the most part, there is a relaxed,
comfortable rural feel. This helps keep down the road rage which can at times be aroused
by the traffic. Along the Corridor, there are numerous neighborhoods and offices close to
NC54, but for the most part they are screened by landscaping. A noticeably different
view is presented by my neighborhood, Eastwood Park. There is no effective barrier
between Eastwood Park and NC54, and with the widening of NC54, the highway will be
quite close to homes there. A theme universally utilized in all kinds of design, be it
interior, landscaping, architecture or whatever, is continuity. There needs to be an
effective level of landscaping/hardscaping between Eastwood Park and NC54 to confer a
sense of continuity to the corridor. This is one of the few areas of the corridor where
utility wires on telephone poles are prominently displayed. These wires/poles are not
attractive, and the landscaping should be "beefy" enough to hide these from view. Aside
from the esoteric contribution, a consistent background (that is, landscaping such as that
seen across the highway, at Falconbridge), would make it less distracting for NC54 traffic
maneuvering through intersections or a superstreet."

Detailed Comments:
- concerned about this plan covering 2 counties and the implications for economic
development, especially the county responsible for taxes. People who currently use the
park and ride areas and the free bus transportation are not from Orange County and are
not paying those taxes but should be responsible for some of it as well.
- add a phasing timeline to help keep this scenario logical
- proposed scenario appears to favor UNC over residents who reside along the corridor
- Durham and Chapel Hill would significantly have to change their zoning regulations to
implement your development proposals
- assumptions for this study were made by outsiders who do not know the land and are
"telling us what to do"
- consider impact of RTP and RDU traffic on the corridor. People living in the corridor
travel to RTP as well
- conduct traffic studies on Farrington Road to asses impact of adding more traffic on the
road due to the park and ride or rail station
- still need an alternative southern route around Chapel Hill to alleviate congestion
- rapid development occurring in Chatham County, so commuters from the south funnel
into Chapel Hill through Farrington ­ must consider this
- I came away from the third public session with the impression that all of the
recommendations being finalized by the consultants favor UNC, the UNC Health system
and the Town of Chapel Hill. Therefore, someone has to stand up and fight for Durham
and Durham residents.
- I think that the overall direction for considering improvements within the limited budget
and existing ROW - FOR THE NC 54 SECTION WEST OF THE LITTLE CREEK
BRIDGE (PRIMARILY CHAPEL HILL AREA) is good.
- I would be very interested in knowing not only about congestion in general but I would
be especially interested to know the duration of rush "hour" under the various scenarios
that were considered and how they compare with the scenario that they decided upon in
the third Workshop, with the superstreet arrangement. I hope that when the final scenario
is presented to the governing bodies and the TAC, these interesting data will be made
available. I would expect others with a more pragmatic view, including those
underwriting the Study, the local citizens and the commuters also to be interested in what
congestion will look like in the future, and how the Study plan will address this issue. In
summary, how long will rush hour last with the superstreet plan and how will it compare
with the duration of rush hour associated with the other plans considered? The
consultants offered no information suggesting that there would be substantially increased
capacity for traffic with their plan. Without data to support their plans, and confidence
that travel will be vastly improved when these plans are implemented, it is possible that
their plans will lead to a catastrophic situation. I'm sorry to say something like this which
seems like not a nice thing to say, I don't intend to be mean. I honestly feel totally out of
the loop as far as what to expect from these plans and sense that a catastrophe is within
the realm of possibility Consequently, to protect the folks who live near the Corridor and
those who use the Corridor, it seems appropriate that the final Corridor Study plan
should include a moratorium under which there will be no development in the Corridor
until after proven capacity for handling the increase in associated traffic is made
available.

- During a question and answer session at the third Workshop I suggested that a lowering
of the speed limit to 35 mph on NC54 in the eastern portion of he Corridor would reduce
the regional utility of the Corridor (thus reducing traffic) and would, to some degree,
address safety concerns raised during the meeting. The speaker responded to the effect
that the state of North Carolina has some authority over the issue. There was no
questioning of the validity of the 35 mph idea. In fact this could be a valuable idea in
offering a "low-hanging fruit" (easy and inexpensive) type of contribution to long-term
problems in the corridor. Since the result of the corridor study is to make
recommendations and not replace signs, I believe that such a recommendation could in
fact be made in the final Corridor Study report and would be potentially quite valuable. I
wish to note that people have been and will continue to be killed by traffic in the corridor.
- Aside from the safety and congestion issues is the esoteric value. What does one
experience as they exit the interstate and enter Chapel Hill? With exceptions at the strip
malls, for the most part, there is a relaxed, comfortable rural feel. This helps keep down
the road rage which can at times be aroused by the traffic. Along the Corridor, there are
numerous neighborhoods and offices close to NC54, but for the most part they are
screened by landscaping. A noticeably different view is presented by my neighborhood,
Eastwood Park. There is no effective barrier between Eastwood Park and NC54, and
with the widening of NC54, the highway will be quite close to homes there. A theme
universally utilized in all kinds of design, be it interior, landscaping, architecture or
whatever, is continuity. There needs to be an effective level of landscaping/hardscaping
between Eastwood Park and NC54 to confer a sense of continuity to the corridor. This is
one of the few areas of the corridor where utility wires on telephone poles are
prominently displayed. These wires/poles are not attractive, and the landscaping should
be "beefy" enough to hide these from view. Aside from the esoteric contribution, a
consistent background (that is, landscaping such as that seen across the highway, at
Falconbridge), would make it less distracting for NC54 traffic maneuvering through

Traffic Issues
I-40/NC-54/Farrington Road intersection:
   The left hand turn problem from westbound NC-54 into southbound Farrington Road
   remains, in my mind, the most difficult situation to resolve. Diverting some of that
   traffic elsewhere seems to be an absolute imperative. Some traffic coming off of I-40
   cannot find a space in the left hand lane and is coming down to the traffic light at
   Huntingridge Road and making a 180-degree turn to get back to Farrington Road.
   Difficulty with left hand turn onto Falconbridge Road from westbound NC-54 during
   rush hours (eastbound traffic is backed up and blocks the lane despite DO NOT
   BLOCK INTERSECTION signs.)
   Much concern about possible increase in cut through traffic onto Huntingridge Road
   due to backup problems on NC-54. At present this mostly occurs during rush hours
   but can occur at other times due to congestion on NC-54.
   What do the I-40 / NC-751, I-40 / 15-501, I-40 / NC-86 interchanges look like
   during rush times? Could there be ways to make these interchanges more appealing
   that would take pressure off the NC-54 situation? One thing that differentiates the
   NC-54 interchange from I-40 west bound when compared to 751, 15-501, and 86 is
   that 54 is the only without a traffic light bounded left turn at the end of the exit ramp.
   Comparing 54 to 15-501, during non-traffic times, 54 seems like a faster drive to
   UNC than 15-501 when starting from their respective exit ramps. Obviously, the
   most important question is, where is everyone taking their cars such that slow downs
   and unsafe situations are being caused by back-ups. For example, if many of them
   are going to the Friday Center to park and ride to UNC then working with the 751
   route (via Stage Coach and Barbee Chapel) to the Friday Center would likely be
   more helpful than others.
   Adding lanes and an interchange at Farrington Rd. would only funnel more traffic to
   the already abysmally dysfunctional intersection of Farrington Rd., NC 54 and I-40.
   Interchanges CREATE slowdowns and congestion; they do not relieve them. Open
   stretches of interstate highway allow for free flowing traffic; interchanges gum up the
   works. There is a logical reason why federal guidelines stipulate that interchanges
   should be 2 miles apart; that principle is violated here. Interchanges also bring
   tremendous pressure for dense, intense land use changes...simply not appropriate
   along this low-density residential portion of Farrington Rd. That decision was
   affirmed by the removal of a transit stop from the area (near Creekside School).
   Creekside School would be negatively impacted by the congestion accompanying an
   interchange.
   Given that the reason that the location of Creekside Elementary School is why the
   study area extends as far north as it does -- per my direct request to MPO staff in an
   early discussion at the MPO -- it should show on maps. School traffic leaving for
   other parts of its massive attendance zone, creates a stand-alone peak of about 30
   minutes duration, almost all of it loading into south-bound Farrington Road and


                                            73
NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study   Compilation of Public Comments                        7/08/10


   thence into the east-bound single left turn lane. There have been days when the left-
   turn wait itself approached the full 30 minutes of the peak period. That is to say,
   someone coming from the north (e.g., this writer) would have had to wait 30 minutes
   to get onto NC 54. I always U-turned and found another route to the RTP, or
   Raleigh, the latter trip taking hardly more than 30 minutes by itself. I have been told
   that adjustment of the signal cycle is not feasible for that stand-alone peak period
   because it is separated from the "normal" peak hour. Given that this turning
   movement is at LOS F for 6-8 hours a day, I have to wonder.
   Pressure for an interchange is coming from Chapel Hill; Durham needs to say no to
   the continual push of development and congestion out of Chapel Hill and into SW
   Durham. That process began by pushing Chapel Hill's outer belt loop, the Laurel
   Hill Parkway, from Sage Rd. to Pope Rd. to Farrington Rd. in an ever eastward
   progression. The name is now Southwest Durham Drive!
   While at first blush, an I-40 interchange at Farrington Road might seem like a good
   idea, upon appropriate examination, the negative consequences of such an
   interchange will again be realized. Last year such a proposal was put before the
   Transportation Advisory Committee. It was removed from ANY further
   consideration. An interchange at I-40 and Farrington Road would put our children at
   risk, threaten the historic Leigh Farm and environmentally sensitive Water Fowl
   Federal Lands, and violate the graves of those laid to rest at Markham Memorial
   Gardens cemetery.
   Specific land uses in the vicinity of Farrington and I-40 include the Prescott Place,
   Glenview Park and Trenton neighborhoods, the Markham Memorial Gardens
   cemetery and Leigh Farm Park, 86 acres of open space protected over the last 20
   years by a public private partnership including the Jr. League of Durham and Orange
   Counties, Triangle Land Conservancy, the State Dept. of Cultural and Natural
   Resources, DUTAG, DOST, Historic Preservation of Durham, Durham Parks and
   Rec, SEEDS and Piedmont Wildlife. There is literally no room for an interchange
   without destroying something of great value (homes, graves, park land).
   Farrington Rd. is a low-density residential greenbelt with 5 sites on the Durham
   Inventory of Cultural and Natural Resources. Leigh Farm Park in particular is a gem
   of open space and anchor to the New Hope Creek Corridor trail system. It should be
   protected, not drowned in asphalt and congestion.
   As the director of Piedmont Wildlife Center, a nonprofit that actively uses Leigh
   Farm Park to teach children and adults the importance of protecting wildlife and our
   natural resources, I believe that Leigh Farm Park and the surrounding New Hope
   Creek watershed would be severely damaged by any increase in traffic brought on by
   an interchange at Farrington Road and I-40. The wetlands in Leigh Farm Park are
   already being damaged by runoff from I-40 and any additional impact could kill the
   wildlife and plants that protect our watershed. Please fight to protect the future of
   our environment!
   I live in the Trenton neighborhood. Several residents have been very vocal in their
   opposition to an interchange at I-40 and Farrington Road. I am not one of them. I

   would welcome easy access to I-40, and the ability to avoid the very busy and
   sometimes dangerous intersection at Farrington and 54.
   Lengthen the left turn only lane on East bound NC 54 at Farrington Road back to the
   Falcon Bridge Road. It is too short now and cars turning left end up blocking car
   proceeding east bound on NC 54 through the Farrington Road intersection. Also, at
   the Farrington Road ­ NC 54 intersection, approaching the intersection South bound
   on Farrington Road:
           a) Lengthen the right turn only lane to 300 to 400 yards back from the
              intersection.
           b) Widen Farrington Road to provide 2 left hand turn lanes with the left
              most turn lane for either NC 54 East bound and/or I 40 East bound and
              the second left turn only lane dedicated solely to I 40 East Bound. This
              would probably also require a re-working of the entrance to I 40 East
              Bound to lengthen the merge lanes.
           c) Extend the all turn lanes an additional 300 yards north of the intersection.
   North bound on Farrington Road at the NC 54intersection:
           a) Widen and lengthen the left turn lane, and add a second left turn lane.
           b) Lengthen the right turn only lane.
   The proposal to add a new ramp at NC54 and I-40 so people coming from
   Hillsborough to Durham adds 2 more lanes of people coming off I-40 (and just
   getting off moving at highway speeds) to be crossed by someone coming from
   Durham to get across to turn on Farrington (or the new intersection formed by
   bringing George King Road down to NC54). Note that that "someone" could be a
   student -- that is an inexperience driver -- driving home from Jordan High School.
   Have you modeled what happens when I-40 breaks down? When Old Chapel Hill
   Road breaks down? What alternative routes are people likely to take?
   In the long run, I guess most of the traffic that now goes down Farrington Road
   would swing over to George King, past the school (I hope someone is thinking about
   school traffic mixing with I-40 back-up traffic, and what this means for all of trying
   to walk to Creekside Elementary School).
   I really prefer 1 phase (no signal ) traffic signal solutions. That is the ultimate
   solution, isn't it? I do believe it is feasible if we allow ourselves to be out of box and
   a little bit more innovative.
   This exercise becomes extremely convoluted, expensive and ill-focused. WHY are
   we even contemplating such histrionics to accommodate automobile traffic instead of
   pushing alternatives. Specifically, I refer to park & ride lots at the 54/40 intersection,
   a limited-time HOV lane, and alternate routing to UNC (which is the culprit in all
   this). There is enough vacant land between I-40 and Manning Drive for a NEW
   THOROUGHFARE directly between the two that wouldn't affect existing businesses
   or residences.

Superstreet Concept:
   One commenter expressed big concerns about the "super street" concept, and the
   changes in access. They expressed shock and dismay that we would suggest people
   might not enjoy the same level of direct access in and out of their facilities,
   especially at the Friday Center (restricting NB lefts who leave and are returning to
   Chapel Hill), the new imaging center at Burning Tree Drive, and their remote health
   care facilities at Farrington Road.
           a) They expressed concern about patients being confused about changes in
              access and having to make U-turns or travel out of direction.
           b) They said they've been working toward making a more seamless,
              interconnected network of satellite facilities, and this just undermines all
              that, including their recent $$$million investment in new facilities.
           c) They've located their facilities for the best accessibility, and now we're
              changing that.
   One commenter wanted to see a flyover at Farrington and I-40 instead of the
   superstreet concept that restricts access at Farrington; similarly, they felt a major
   redesign of the I-40 interchange should be in our plan, not just an "interim solution"
   for 2020.
   Going south on Farrington, you could only make a right turn onto NC54. If you want
   to go left, you would go down George King Road (assuming the new intersection
   there got built first), where you could make a left turn. If you wanted to go down
   toward Stagecoach Road, you would need to turn right at George King Road (or at
   Farrington) and go west to a U-turn at Huntingridge (like the new superstreet on 15-
   501) -- or more likely sneak through the neighborhood.
   If you wanted to go down Burning Tree or through Meadowmont to get to the golf
   course (or the Botanical Gardens or Friday Center), you would need to go west
   through how many stop lights before you could make a U-turn?
   During the meeting (Workshop 3), I added one more idea. I called it "SWOLLEN
   solution" during the meeting if you could hear me. I dubbed it SWOLLEN because
   the street might not be straight around this part. The on-going street swerve outward
   to allow to add one lane for U-turn. This lane is solely dedicated to the U-turn
   traffic without any signal light and allows the U-turn traffic merge gracefully to the
   incoming traffic. During our phone conversation, I compared it to how we enter the
   interstate traffic. You pointed out the main difference, instead of merging into the
   traffic from left to right, drivers need to learn to merge from right to left. As we all
   experienced the first time to enter the interstate and got frozen with terror when we
   tried to merge into the non-stopping traffic, this could be a little confusing but every
   average driver will learn it in a day or two. There is first time for everything. In
   Orlando, the exit to Universal Studio theme park from I-4 East bound is not on the
   right side. You need to change to the left most lane to exit. If you miss that exit, you
   need to take the next exit to come back. It was confusing in the first time. If this
   dedicated lane is long enough, it will even reduce this confusion. I didn't have a
   chance to measure the distance for this. We know how to merge from left to right. It


                                            76
NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study   Compilation of Public Comments                         7/08/10


   happens all the time on high way. If the dedicated lane is long enough, after a very
   slow U-turn, cars would have enough time to speed up to speed limit on Hwy 54 and
   merge gracefully to in-coming traffic. The main advantage of having a fly over or
   underground U-turn road is the length required to allow the cars to speed up to the
   speed to safely merge into the traffic. The main disadvantage is the construction cost.
   Alternative solution one (alternative two): merge ahead lane - If necessary, the left
   most lane of the Hwy 54 can be marked as "merge ahead from right, slow down to 40
   mph." Even in this scenario, only the left most lane is subject to this restriction, not
   the rest. The rest lanes enjoy green signal without any speed reduction. Alternative
   solution two : 1 and 1/2 PHASE SUPERSTREET: In case this is the hindrance
   in the implementation, I'd like to present 1 and 1/2 phase superstreet: The idea is
   quite simple. Before Hwy 54 lanes approaches the intersection with the U-turn lane,
   the left most lane is split from the rest of the lanes. This separated left most lane is
   subject to the 2 phase traffic signal to allow the U-turn traffic to flow alternatively.
   The rest of the lane besides the left most will not be disrupted as 1 phase. We can
   expect that most of cars would try to avoid this slow left most-lane by switching the
   lane if the situation allows. the separation of the left most lane can be done with a
   simple construction of median etc. In consideration of the all proposed development
   along Hwy 54, I do believe we need eventually to add more lanes to Hwy 54.
   Without superstreet, adding lanes wouldn't help; however, with the implementation
   of superstreet especially 1 or 1 and 1/2 phase superstreet, adding lane would really
   add the capacity. I'd like to recommend - phase one - super street; phase two -
   adding more lanes to Hwy 54 (long term solution but need to reserve some land
   along Hwy 54).
Increased Congestion:
   Concerns about increased congestion from possible UNC medical facilities going
   into two buildings recently vacated on NW corner of NC-54 and Farrington Road.
   Egress from that site onto Farrington Road very difficult because entrance is only 30
   to 40 feet from NC-54.
Collector Roads:
   Current proposed collector roads which run along Celeste Circle and Crossland Drive
   will adversely impact the access to and from the homes located within Eastwood
   Park. The homeowners of Eastwood Park proposed a new collector road which
   would utilize the current infrastructure located at NC54. The proposal utilizes an
   existing stoplight at the intersection of Highway 54 which is used by the homeowners
   of Eastwood Park and Falconbridge as well as the businesses located along the
   service road on Highway 54. The homeowners of Eastwood Park propose that the
   land located within Eastwood Park be allocated as Highway Commercial and Office
   Development.
George King Road:
   George King Road is re-routed to make a T-junction with NC54 via Crossland Drive,
   which is in our neighborhood. The Leigh Village map proposes to seal off and thus
   prevent access of our neighborhood to NC54 via the light at Huntingridge Road
   which leads from NC54 into the Falconbridge neighborhood. Thus, remaining would


                                           77
NC-54/I-40 Corridor Study    Compilation of Public Comments                         7/08/10


   be a "double T" arrangement of George King and Huntingridge Roads which the
   developer thought were close enough so that the signals would be timed so that they
   functioned as a single light. Importantly also, the Service Road and Celeste Circle
   access to NC54 would be via Leigh Village. To exit our neighborhood we would
   have to drive into Leigh Village and circle around to get to NC54. The neighbors
   that I have spoken with like this plan. It would make commercial development on
   the Service Road and Celeste Circle unattractive since access to NC54 would be
   inconvenient and there would be more plantings between the Service Road and NC54
   which would make our neighborhood less visible.
   George King Rd. should be paved and the Meadowmont Connector built as planned.
   I understand there is discussion about George King and Farrington and how best to
   direct the traffic in the future. My hope would be that George King is left alone,
   gravel and all. It is a wonderful refuge for all of us who live close by for walks,
   retreats, and enjoying the wildlife area. I would hope that it wouldn't change at all
   but I have been told there is not a chance of that happening. I believe there would be
   a significant negative environmental impact to re-route and/or pave George King. I
   actually believe it should be closed to traffic except for the folks who need to access
   their own driveways. Why can't we have one piece of road left that is a refuge for
   wildlife and people who enjoy being near the wildlife.
Other Traffic Issues:
   Is there a plan for a crossover at Hwy 54/Hamilton due to 54 East/Walking
   Traffic/schools?
   A Southern connector joining 15-501 and 751 should be investigated as an
   alternative route to help relieve congestion on NC 54.
   Another concept to investigate: Existing I-40 could become business I-40 (as with I-
   85 in Greensboro and I-40 in Winston-Salem) with a new I-40 bypassing the Triangle
   to the south.
   Install a "DO NOT BLOCK INTERSECTION" sign at Little John Road East bound
   on NC 54.
   To facilitate the flow of traffic on NC 54, into to Chapel Hill in the morning and
   exiting Chapel Hill in the evening rush hour, arrange all the traffic lights in both
   directions on NC 54 in sequence.
   Barbee Chapel Road north bound at NC 54:
           a) Widen to 3 lanes to include a right turn only lane.
           b) Extend multiple lanes back to almost the Finley Forest entrance.
   Widen NC 54 to 4 lanes between Farrington Road and NC 751.
   Provide a direct access to I 40 from Farrington Mill Road to accommodate the
   hundreds of cars driving from Chatham County to I 40 at Farrington Road. Or in the
   alternative, provide direct access from Farrington Mill Road to Stagecoach Road so
   Chatham County driver could access I 40 at NC 751.

   Install traffic signals at the Stagecoach Road - Farrington Road intersection.
   Install traffic signals where Farrington Mill Road "T" intersects with Farrington
   Road/Barbee Chapel Hill Road.
   Widen Stagecoach Road at Farrington Road to provide both left and right turn lanes.
   Longer term, widen both Farrington Road and Barbee Chapel Road to 4 lanes.

   For those of us who already take our lives in our hands (including me & my entire
   neighborhood in Glen Lennox)--and that of children & elders & folks of all ages--
   because we LIVE parallel to NC54 and MUST travel it just to get in/out of our
   neighborhoods & to/from work, schools, church, hospital, veterinarians, grocery
   store & related necessities, & home again, dear Lord help us and save us, AND the
   LAST thing we need is MORE TRAFFIC & anything like these Michigan U-turn
   things or anything else that will ADD to the traffic on THAT road, and PLEASE do
   NOT expand NC 54 to 6 lanes. It is NOT safe now, and adding U-turn things is NOT
   going to make it safer!!
   In fact, there are traffic/safety studies showing that when you add lanes, you increase
   car accidents because of the lane changes that more lanes induce and also because
   speed (temporarily) increases. Then there is induced traffic. De to the phenomenon
   of induced traffic, by adding capacity you will draw more drivers to the area (hence,
   vehicle miles traveled) than would have otherwise used that route had it remained
   with fewer lanes. By increasing capacity we would also, obviously, be adding more
   air pollution from cars and trucks. Oh yeah, more noise pollution, too.
   One entrance to/from Pinehurst, NC has had a traffic-calming, & I believe accident-
   lessening traffic circle for approximately 45 or so--it joins 4 entrances/exits as it joins
   Midland Road coming from Southern Pines to Pinehurst, and Highway 2 &
   Highway 15-501 at one circle that is also very close to the regional hospital and has
   an entrance/exit to the hospital, as well as the entrance/exit to Pinehurst continuing
   Midland Road. If you don't understand how to drive it on it initially, you might find
   yourself circling it a couple of times until you figure it out...however it avoids head-
   on collisions where there were no stop-lights, etc. The round-a-bout on Ephesus/Pope
   Road has increased safety as has what I believe is a similar round-about thing at Pope
   Road & Old Chapel Hill Road. The traffic pattern at Farrington Rd/NC 54/I40 is a
   dangerous take your life in your hands nightmare. I am opposed to anything that will
   deliberately encourage more traffic on NC 54. We need to have less traffic and safer
   way to use that road now and nothing to encourage more traffic on what is already an
   extremely dangerous road. I do not want to see any lanes added, & I just don't see
   how things like those configurations that were added at 15-501 & Erwin or across
   from Environ Way on NC 54 could possibly do anything but make a bad situation
   worse. Adding lanes I believe should be considered not an option, period!!

Alternative Transportation
   Funding for transit may never materialize; exploding densities (based on
   the presupposition of transit corridors) could be a serious mistake, destroying the
   very character that makes North Carolina more attractive than New Jersey.
   The issue of a lack of good public transportation along the corridor was raised.
   Whether our residents in significant numbers would use it is questionable.
   Epcon senior citizen neighborhood is in full-swing (wrt construction), and these
   residents should have public transport as well. Stats show that with increase in age
   (past retirement) comes an increase in automobile accident incidents, and many older
   people no longer have a valid driver's license.
   Rail-WITH-TRAIL, if light rail ever ventures into reality, should be incorporated
   into each and every design model. Plenty of working examples of RWT exist in the
   U.S., including the Libba Cotten Trail in Carrboro.
   As a new Triangle Transit trustee, I am not aware of any use proposed within the 50-
   foot wide light rail corridor besides the 28-foot wide dual-track alignment. The TT
   Board of Trustees voted yesterday to initiate the NEPA process via an Alternatives
   Analysis, and additional use of the corridor may come up in that process. The
   heavily-used Libba Cotten trail is in an abandoned rail ROW.
   Most of UNC's patients will not use transit. They do recognize the need for rail and
   additional bus transit, but not at the expense of improving auto access and mobility.
   UNC suggested that the light rail transit station south of 54 behind the East 54
   development did not make sense given our clustering of development nodes with the
   walkable ¼ to ½ mile circles. They felt we should be joining them in challenging that
   location because of its proximity to a golf course, and the better location was north of
   54 at Glen Lenox. They acknowledged it was outside of our scope, but said we
   should be critiquing that station location. I let them know the AA would address it.
   UNC did not see the value of park and ride lots outside of the corridor, such as at NC
   751 and 15-501. They contend "their" people will not use those lots, and don't see
   them providing value. Most of their park and ride lot users drive a relatively long
   way to the Friday Center, and then take a short bus ride to their destination. There is
   a comfortable mindset knowing that it is UNC-owned property and if they have an
   emergency, the university will take care of them so they aren't stranded. They have a
   unique park and ride profile due to the severe parking limits on campus...unlike
   conventional park and ride users, their folks act more like auto commuters than
   transit riders. The idea that we have different markets being served did not resonate
   with them. They could not fathom someone riding 15-25 minutes on the bus after
   driving to a park and ride lot.
   UNC strongly supports the Leigh Village park and ride, especially if it offers more
   space for commuter lots than they currently have at the Friday Center. UNC is
   moving to restrict Friday Center commuter lot access to non-university faculty, staff
   and patients. They do not see a future for park and ride remaining at the Friday
   Center beyond the near term.

   The parking limits we showed for the ¼ mile area around the stations were a
   problem. Unlike the business/developer group (which indicated those parking ratios
   would be achievable), this group did not think there would be any market value for
   such restrictions on health care-related uses, even in the ¼ mile area (primarily at the
   Friday Center). They said the Meadowmont center is declining because of a lack of
   parking, and will need more parking at the Friday Center station area than we've
   indicated.
Public Bus Transportation:
   I like the idea of the more bus service, but it doesn't help someone like me who
   mostly goes 5-10 miles around southern Durham, and not to a node likely to be on
   multiple bus routes. If I have to take 2-3 different buses to go 5 miles, congestion
   and gas prices would have to get much, much worse to get me out of my car.
   3 separate comments about getting a Durham public bus stop within walking distance
   of Creekside Elementary, as well as the Epcon Senior Citizen Neighborhood:
          1. Creekside Elementary currently is the only school (of which we are aware)
             that has no public bus stop within walking distance. Creekside is a
             beautifully diverse school, in terms of ethnicity and socio-economics, but
             this comes with its challenges. I have been involved in the School
             Improvement Plan, and the great disparity between low income students
             and mid-high income students was a subject of most serious concern. We
             have a tremendous number of bus riders, a large number of whose parents
             do not have personal transportation. This hinders their involvement and
             our ability to provide services/workshops/etc. for them at Creekside. At
             the very least, these low income families need reliable transportation
             outside of school bus hours in order to participate fully in the programs
             available to them at the school. Lack of public transport was also seen as
             an impediment to the involvement of 'Families and Community,' which is
             a goal upon which Creekside and all schools are judged. The fact that
             public bus transportation does not extend to Creekside was seen as the
             biggest problem with engaging the community and the parents.
          2. Any after-school (or before-school activities) must necessarily involve
             private transportation -- adding to traffic in this area. The lack of public
             transportation serving our school's area limits family and community
             involvement at our school. The bus stop would enable parents to come to
             school for parent-teacher conferences, math/literacy nights, family socials,
             PTA meetings, movie nights, etc.
          3. I have contacted the Durham school board about this, and have been told
             they would support a public bus stop here. However, the city has not been
             as encouraging. It would help if you all recommended to the city that a
             public bus stop be put in this area to facilitate school transportation
             (particularly extracurricular transportation), and possible connection to
             public transport to Chapel Hill from Durham. If you could also involve the
             Durham Public School Board, that would help too!

Strong interest in biking, but safety is a concern:
   I live in Southern Village on the southern part of Chapel Hill and work in RTP. I love
   to cycle but have to extend my cycling path to commute to work via Stage Couch Rd,
   Massey Chapel, etc. as the 54 corridor is not negotiable safely. That extends my
   bicycle commute to ~75min one way which would likely be ~55min if I could safely
   go straight on 54.
   In my opinion an express bus or rail system to RTP as a center of gravity for
   employment would already reduce contention on this corridor significantly.
   Though I strongly lobby for off-road bike paths the impact to contention during rush
   hour will likely be limited. Other alternatives will need to consider alternative
   corridors going in parallel. Further widening of the current road falls short of
   increasing capacity as the intersections are and stay the bottleneck. Even with 4 lanes
   on 54 most people will have to turn right onto I-40 and thus funnel into one lane
   which will continue to gate the capacity. If higher vehicle capacity along this
   direction is required it will require alternative corridors connecting to I-40 further
   south/east in parallel to 54. Hopefully that can be avoided by improvement in public
   transportation and connections of bike and pedestrian facilities to enable people to
   get to bus and rail stops.
   I am concerned about 54 as one of the few routes between Chapel Hill and Durham
   which is extremely unfriendly to cyclists. The narrow section through the wetland
   has no shoulder and steep banks on either side. Riders have been pushed off the road
   and down the embankment through the blackberry bushes. One concept program that
   has the right idea is the complete streets program. The link is:
   http://www.completestreets.org/resources/new-pedestrian-safety-ranking-calls-for-
   complete-streets/.
   From my perspective, equal safe access for all modes of travel is a civil rights issue,
   just like the Americans with Disabilities act requires public ways and buildings be
   handicapped accessible, shopping centers, post offices, banks, government centers,
   churches, etc all need to be accessible by walking or bike, too. Pedestrians and
   cyclists are essentially fenced in by uncrossable highways. Whole most peds and
   cyclists travel locally, some do want to go to Durham. There are not any comfortable
   ways of getting there. While crossing Estes Drive during dusk, inside a crosswalk
   and with a crossing light, this commenter was almost hit by a car whose driver did
   not see her ­ and this has happened several times. Each time, she reports to the town
   of Chapel Hill that something needs to be done to improve safety. I have written to
   the town traffic people suggesting more light at this intersection, to paint the
   crosswalks solid white so a body silhouette is visible to drivers at dusk, and that there
   be rumple strips place a few seconds on approach to any crosswalk to alert the driver
   physically that a crosswalk is ahead.
   Safe passage through the I-40/NC54/exit 273 gauntlet. The interchange, with its one-
   leaf clover, is a deathtrap for cyclists and pedestrians heading west on NC54,
   especially since NCDOT widened the ramp into a double lane racetrack. Better
   options, in order of safety preference:

           a) Bike-ped bridge over (or tunnel under) I-40, just north of NC54,
              connecting with future light rail corridor
           b) Stoplight on the cloverleaf that bike-ped commuters can activate by push
              button
           c) 12', two-way bike-ped sidepath on south side of NC54
   The Exit 273 interchange area is generally considered the most dangerous section of
   surface street for 'cyclists in Durham and Orange Counties. We've never had a
   fatality on that part of NC 54 -- although have had another well-known one to the
   west -- probably because we simply avoid it.
   There is a 10-foot sidepath on the north and south sides of NC 54 for the entire length
   of the Meadowmont community. The sides are connected with a reconstructed cattle
   tunnel in Meadowmont. All other connections are at-grade at signals, and I find
   them difficult because of the briefness of the available signal cycle.
Development Issues
   Eastwood Park neighborhood would like to avoid commercial development in their
   neighborhood and protect it from the hostile environment of NC-54 through the use
   of landscaping and vegetative/earth barriers. The proposed Leigh Village
   development shows a good way to incorporate commercial development while
   leaving the Eastwood Park neighborhood residential.
   Celeste Circle resident would like to have the hardscaping barriers and also some
   landscaping put in place to try and offset some of the noise and pollution if there is a
   change that increases noise and pollution.
   To blame the UNC park and ride lots for the traffic on Highway 54 ignores the
   development along the corridor, the fact that housing in Chapel Hill has become less
   and less available for people who work in the Town and therefore have to travel to
   work, and the fact that more businesses are there now than in the past. It is
   unfortunate that the focus group organizers did not invite UNC representatives to
   come to the meetings with, for example developers, so that this could be clarified.
   The UNC park and ride lots are just one of many reasons for the high traffic counts
   on the highway, and on a given day make up a small percentage of the total traffic on
   the roadway.
   The development of Carolina North must be taken into account when studying future
   traffic needs in this area.

Other Issues
   Farrington Rd. is a low-density residential greenbelt with 5 sites on the Durham
   Inventory of Cultural and Natural Resources. Leigh Farm Park in particular is a gem
   of open space and anchor to the New Hope Creek Corridor trail system.
   Preservation, not more pavement, is our watchword.

   When a small turn in lane was added for eastbound traffic to turn into Huntingridge
   Road they made it very sharp so they did not have to move existing storm drain.
   This is a problem for many of our residents.
   Speed limit should be enforced. On the 54 corridor described, it goes through a
   wetland, so any expansion of the road immediately presents water displacement
   issues for the surrounding buildings. For this reason, the only way to add is to build a
   long bridge. If you do build a bike-ped path, make it far enough away so the traffic
   noise doesn't make the cyclists deaf. I am convinced that my husband's hearing issues
   are from years of traffic noise as he ran or biked on the street. I measured the traffic
   noise beside 15-501 to be over 80 dB with my sound meter.
   The concept of staging/phasing is important. It was a bit lost on them at the outset
   that we were talking about changes in the corridor over a 5-10-20 year time frame.
   When we discussed the timing and overall horizon for the plan, they seemed to
   recognize big changes were likely to occur, and were needed.

Future Traffic Projection Methodology

Historical traffic volumes are available for the major roadways within the study area from 1997
through 2007 (and 2008 for I-40). The average historical growth rate for the study area from the
past decade is approximately 3 percent per year, non-compounded. Farrington Road and Barbee
Chapel Road have extremely high historical growth rates of 8 to 10 percent per year.

The Durham ­ Chapel Hill ­ Carrboro Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)'s regional
travel demand model produces traffic forecasts based on the planning policies and programs
from the adopted long range transportation plan (LRTP) with a horizon year of 2035. The traffic
projections from the model have a lower rate of growth than the historical traffic patterns, as
shown in Table 1. The average growth rate of the study area is 2 percent per year.

The study team examined the historical and projected growth rates for the major roads within the

For the most part, the LRTP original travel demand model projections are somewhere in the
middle of the different growth rates. The study team expected that the model results from the
final "most reasonable" scenario, formerly referred to as the preferred scenario, would fall
somewhere near the LRTP original travel demand projections and the projections from the
various scenarios. Using the growth rates from the original travel demand model will produce
the following volumes. These volumes may be slightly different based on the final elements
modeled in the "most recent" scenario, but these volumes provide the study team with a starting
point for the function design of the roadway improvements.

At the 3/11 meeting, steering committee members agreed that using a design year of 2020 would
be the most reasonable for functional design of the transportation improvements, with the intent
that traffic will continue to be monitored for additional improvements after 2020.

The preferred scenario was tested and higher volumes resulted. The projected 2020 preferred
scenario volumes are similar to the 2035 LRTP volumes, averaging about 70,000 to 75,000
vehicles per day on NC 54. Ultimately the development densities within the corridor are
accelerating the travel demand, and the transportation improvements would be needed under the
LRTP scenario in 2035 (due to regional growth) will be needed in 2020 under the preferred
scenario (due to growth within the corridor). The preferred scenario growth projection assumes
a steady rate of development in the corridor and growth in traffic volumes. In reality, the
preferred scenario cannot occur until the light rail system is imminent or in place, and the
demand that the model projects may not actually occur until 2030 or 2035.

The study team proceeded in modeling the 2020 future volumes for the preferred scenario in
Synchro and obtained a recommended solution which was presented at the third public workshop
in May 2010. The Synchro analysis notes and levels of service are found later in this appendix.

Following this workshop, the study team was instructed to recommend a solution for the long-
term 2035 traffic demand, which is about 90,000 to 95,000 vehicles per day on the Chapel Hill
side of the corridor and reaches up to 100,000 vehicles per day near Farrington Road and the I-40
interchange. .

The demand of 70,000 to 75,000 vehicles per day will require significant interchange
improvements and superstreet intersections, as discussed in the Roadway Recommendations
section of the report. Demand in excess of 70,000 to 75,000 vehicles per day will need a new
interchange or a modification to the existing interchange for direct access to Leigh Village in
addition to the superstreet intersections. This improvement, coupled with the other
improvements in transit service, light rail and pedestrian and bicyclist infrastructure will
accommodate the overall travel demand for the corridor.

Future Traffic Projection Methodology ­ Addendum
Phase 2 Traffic Analysis

The draft report for Phase 1 of the NC 54/I-40 Corridor Study was submitted, reviewed,
and released for public comment in August 2010. After the review and comment period,
several supplemental analysis tasks were necessary to refine the study recommendations.

This supplemental analysis included revisions to the land use projections. The upper
density limits of the most intense land use, Mixed Use 1, were scaled back to 60 dwelling
units per acre to be consistent with the City of Durham's suburban transit area
designation. Some of the land currently owned by the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill (UNC) was projected to develop or redevelop into intense employment uses
of up to 175 employees per acre in the Phase 1 report. After speaking with UNC
representatives, it became clear that these areas are not likely to develop or redevelop
within the next 25 years.

With these land use revisions in mind, and the continuity of the economic downturn and
decline in new construction, the volumes used for the 2020 analysis in Phase 1 were
reconsidered. These volumes are not likely to materialize until much later, and should be
conditioned upon development of the light rail system.

The direct access ramps into Leigh Village were removed after the Phase 1 review
period. Phase 2 analyses for the I-40 interchange were conducted to acheive a workable
solution without the direct access ramps. Phase 2 analysis also included analysis of the
US 15-501 interchange with NC 54.

The analysis of the I-40 interchange area contained many iterations. After traffic
operation analysis was complete, the functional design development required refinements
to the final design. These refinements were evaluated through identification of fatal
flaws. Therefore, the final recommended functional design and line drawings presented
in the report are not 100 percent consistent with Synchro analysis reports contained in
this appendix.

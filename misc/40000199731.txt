Re: Hansen Pipe Wetland & Wildlife Habitat Reconnaissance Study
The Watershed Company Reference Number: 130322

Dear Brenda:

This letter presents the findings of a wetland reconnaissance conducted on the
approximately 34-acre Hansen Pipe property located at 4601 South Orchard Street in the
City of Tacoma (Pierce County parcel 0220133949). I visited the site on March 28, 2013
and investigated vegetated areas for the presence of wetlands and streams.

Methods
Public-domain information on the subject properties was reviewed for this delineation
study. These sources include USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service Soil maps,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetland Inventory maps, Washington
Department of Fish and Wildlife interactive mapping programs (PHS on the Web),
Peirce County sensitive areas maps, and Pierce County's online GIS information.

The study area was evaluated for wetlands using methodology from the Regional
Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Western Mountains,
Valleys, and Coast Region Version 2.0 (Regional Supplement). Wetlands are determined on
the basis of an examination of vegetation, soils, and hydrology. These parameters were
sampled at several locations along the wetland boundary to make the determination.

Findings
The parcel is nearly fully developed and in industrial use. Vegetation is limited to a
narrow fringe along property boundaries and a roughly 1.8-acre area in the southeast
corner of the parcel. The adjacent parcel south of the subject parcel is also vegetated and
was investigated. Other adjacent properties are developed mostly for commercial and
industrial use, with some residential development to the south. The nearest
documented wetlands are approximately 550 feet south and 700 feet to the west of the
                                                                             B. Richardson
                                                                             March 29, 2013
                                                                                    Page 2

Hansen Pipe property at their nearest points. These wetlands are too distant from the
subject property to encumber the property with buffers.

The southeast vegetated portion of the property includes scot's broom- and Himalayan
blackberry-dominated disturbed patch at roughly the same grade as the developed part
of the property. The area slopes downward to the south and supports some mid-aged
Douglas-fir, western red cedar, and red alder, with an understory of osoberry,
Himalayan blackberry, and other native and non-native species. A disturbed area with
large tire tracks, cleared of trees and most native vegetation, is in the lowest point (Photo
1 at the end of this report). Some creeping buttercup represents the only species that is
commonly found in wetlands. The species is a very aggressive grower and readily
colonizes disturbed areas in both wetlands and uplands. The area supporting creeping
buttercup does not meet wetland criteria, as it supports primarily non-wetland
vegetation, does not exhibit wetland hydrology, and has upland soils (10YR 4/4 and 10
YR 3/2 very sandy loam in a roughly 50%-50% mixed matrix). No other point within
this area showed any wetland characteristics.

The forested neighboring parcel to the south of the Hansen Pipe property is dominated
by mature Douglas-fir with a red alder component and a dense understory of salal,
osoberry, red elderberry, red huckleberry, low Oregon grape, sword fern, holly,
Himalayan blackberry, and a widespread infestation of English ivy (Photo 2).
Salmonberry is growing in one small area next to an uprooted tree's rootwad. This area
has bright, dry soils (2.5 YR 4/4 sandy loam under an 8-inch duff layer) with no wetland
characteristics.

A "windshield survey" of the surrounding properties revealed no obviously wetlands,
with the exception of the documented offsite wetlands mentioned above. The narrow
strip of vegetation bordering the Hansen Pipe property shows no wetland
characteristics. In conclusion, no wetlands or streams are located on or encumber the
subject property.

I.   INTRODUCTION

This study serves to investigate traffic impacts related to the proposed Orchard Industrial
Center. The main goals of this study focus on the assessment of existing traffic
conditions and intersection congestion, forecasts of newly generated project traffic, and
estimations of future intersection delay. The first task includes the collection of general
roadway information, road improvement information, entering sight distance data, and
peak hour traffic counts. Next, a detailed level of service analysis of the existing volumes
is made to determine the present degree of intersection congestion. Forecasts of future
traffic and dispersion patterns on the surrounding street system are then determined using
established trip generation and distribution techniques. Following this forecast, the future
service levels for the key intersections are investigated. As a final step, appropriate
conclusions and possible off-site mitigation measures are defined.


II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The proposed project is a high-cube/distribution warehouse building with a size of
571,200 square feet. The site is located on the north side of S 48th Street, just east of S
Orchard Street in the City of Tacoma, on Parcel #0220133049. There have recently been
two industrial buildings totaling 149,500 square feet for the Hanson Pipe & Products
operations, however this use has closed down and is undergoing some demolition work.
Access to the site will be provided by a direct connection at the end of S 46th Street as
well as a driveway onto S 48th Street. Surrounding development is generally industrial,
commercial, residential, or undeveloped land. For traffic analysis purposes, the
anticipated buildout and occupancy year for the project is 2015, which was targeted as the
horizon analysis year. Figure 1 on the following page shows the project location and the
local street network. The proposed site plan showing the overall site layout is shown in
Figure 2.


III. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A. Surrounding Roadway System

Roadways serving the proposed site consist mostly of local roads that vary in width,
terrain, and posted speeds. As indicated by their specific arterial designations, these
roadways also vary in their overall function as part of the general network. The key
streets near the site are described on page 6.




                                              3
4
5
S Orchard Street is a north-south, five-lane major arterial that lies to the west of the
project site. The posted speed limit is 35 mph. Paving consists of asphalt concrete and
lane widths are around 11 feet. Shoulders in the area are curbed, with sidewalks on the
east side of the road. A two-way left turn lane is provided.

S 46th Street is an east-west access road that connects to the west side of the project. The
speed limit is not posted but assumed 25 mph. Total width is roughly 30 feet, with
grass/gravel shoulders.

S 48th Street is an east-west local road that borders the south side of the site. The speed
limit is assumed at 25 mph. Pavement surfacing is comprised of asphalt concrete with a
total roadway width of approximately 30 feet. Some speed humps are present. Shoulders
are curb/gutter/sidewalk to the west, and grass/gravel to the east of the site.

B. Existing Peak Hour Volumes

Field data for this study was taken in March of 2013. Traffic counts used in this report
were taken during the evening peak period between the hours of 4 PM and 6 PM. This
specific peak period was targeted for analysis purposes since it generally represents a
worst case scenario for residential and commercial developments with respect to traffic
conditions. This is primarily due to the common 8 AM to 5 PM work schedule. Most
commuters return to their dwellings at the same time of day which translates to a natural
peak in intersection traffic loads, especially when combined with the relatively large
number of personal trips. Figure 3 shows the weekday PM peak volumes for the key
intersections of S Orchard Street & S 46th Street, and S Orchard Street & S 48th Street.
Turning movement data can be found in the appendix.

C. Level of Service

Existing peak hour delays were determined through the use of the 2010 Highway
Capacity Manual. Capacity analysis is used to determine level of service (LOS) which is
an established measure of congestion for transportation facilities. LOS is defined for a
variety of facilities including intersections, freeways, arterials, etc. A complete definition
of level of service and related criteria can be found in the HCM. The methodology for
determining the LOS at signalized intersections strives to determine the volume to
capacity ( /c) ratios for the various intersection movements as well as the average control
delay for those movements. Delay is generally used to measure the degree of driver
discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and lost time. Control delay, in particular,
includes movements at slower speeds and stops on intersection approaches as vehicles




                                              6
                                              6

move up in queue position or slow down upstream of an intersection. Aside from the
overall quantity of traffic, three specific factors influence signalized intersection LOS.
These include the type of signal operation provided, the signal phasing pattern, and the
specific allocation of green time.

The methodology for determining the LOS at unsignalized intersections strives to
determine the potential capacities for the various vehicle movements and ultimately
determines the average total delay for each movement. Potential Capacity represents the
number of additional vehicles that could effectively utilize a particular movement, which
is essentially the equivalent of the difference between the movement capacity and the
existing movement volume. Total delay is described as the elapsed time from when a
vehicle stops at the end of a queue until the vehicle departs from the stop line. Average
total delay is simply the mean total delay over the entire stream. A number of factors
influence potential capacity and total delay including the availability/usefulness of gaps.

The range for intersection level of service is LOS A to LOS F with the former indicating
the best operating conditions with low control delays and the latter indicating the worst
conditions with heavy control delays. Detailed descriptions of intersection LOS are given
in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual. LOS results for the key intersections can be
found in Table 1. Level of service calculations were made through the use of the
automated intersection analysis program known as HCS2010. This program follows
Chapter 17 procedures of the HCM for unsignalized intersection analysis.

As shown in the table, delays are moderate at LOS B to LOS C for existing conditions.

D. Pedestrian and Bicycle Activity

Observations of pedestrian and bicycle activity were made at the key intersections during
traffic counts and site visits. During the evening peak hour, some mild pedestrian
volumes were noted on S Orchard Street and S 48th Street. As noted previously, S
Orchard Street has sidewalks on the east side of the road.

                                              8
E. Public Transit

A review of the Pierce Transit regional bus schedule indicates that transit service is
provided near the project. Routes 51 and 53 provide service on S Orchard Street from
roughly 6:00 AM to 7:30 PM. No project trip reductions were made despite the
availability of transit service.

F. Sight Distance at Access Driveway

A preliminary examination of the proposed site access points was made to determine
whether or not adequate entering sight distance can be provided for inbound and
outbound project traffic. AASHTO Green Book standards require a sight distance of 280
feet for a 25 mph design speed, or 445 feet for a 40 mph design speed. The access onto S
46th Street is a direct connection at the end of the street, with no sight distance issues.
Adequate sight is available for the project connection onto S 48th Street, although there is
a 90 degree turn in the road to the east approximately 230 feet away. Vehicles navigating
this turn would be low, enabling adequate time for entering movements onto S 48th
Street.

Heavy vehicles require more entering sight distance due to longer times to make turning
movements, however they have a higher eye height than passenger vehicles. An
examination of the S 46th Street and S 48th Street connections onto S Orchard Street was
made to ensure adequate entering sight distance is available for heavy vehicles.
AASHTO guidelines indicate an entering sight distance of 718 feet required for a heavy
vehicle left turn movement assuming a 40 mph design speed. Examinations indicate this
minimum is exceeded both to the north and south of both street connections to S Orchard
Street, with over 800 feet of sight available.


IV. FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

A. Trip Generation

Trip generation is used to determine the magnitude of project impacts on the surrounding
street system. This is usually denoted by the quantity or specific number of new trips that
enter and exit a project during a designated time period, such as a specific peak hour or an
entire day. Data presented in this report was taken from the Institute of Transportation
Engineers publication, Trip Generation, 8th Edition. The designated land use for this
project is defined as High Cube Warehouse/Distribution Center (LUC 152) for the
571,200 square feet of building space. ITE average rates were used. Shown in Table 2
are the trip generation values used for this study. Included are the average daily trips, AM

into the analysis and are also not included in the existing conditions turning movement

Data from the ITE Trip Generation Manual indicates that daily, AM, and PM peak hour
heavy vehicle percentages may be in the 23 to 27 percent range. This study assumes a
heavy vehicle percentage of 30 percent, incorporated into the trip assignments and level
of service analysis.

B. Trip Distribution

The pattern by which project trips disperse on the roadway network is highly variable and
largely depends on driver behavior and psychological factors. Based on this information,
general estimations of traffic distribution are made to determine the impacts of a project
on the surrounding street network. Trips generated by the project are expected to follow
the pattern shown in Figure 4 on the following page. Percentages are generally based on
existing traffic patterns and the layout of the nearby roadway network. Of the project
trips traveling to/from S Orchard Street, a split of roughly 70/30 was assumed favoring
the S 46th access over the S 48th access.

Allowance for heavy vehicle usage of S 48th Street is requested. Although actual usage
levels are expected to be low, the allowance of this route for heavy vehicle access onto S
Orchard Street would not be expected to substantially hinder operations. The trip
distribution and analysis assumes this usage in order to show the potential impacts.

C. Roadway Improvements

A review of the most recent City of Tacoma Six-Year Road Transportation Improvement
Program indicates that there are no current city roadway improvements in the immediate
vicinity. A review of the latest City of University Place Transportation Improvement
Program also indicates no planned improvements in the site vicinity.

D. Peak Hour Volumes

For forecasting purposes the anticipated buildout and occupancy year of 2015 was
targeted for future traffic volume estimations. Baseline 2015 peak hour volumes without
the project were derived by applying a 2 percent growth rate to the existing volumes
found in Figure 3. In addition, pipeline volumes from the Orchard Ridge and Woodside
Creek residential developments were included for future estimations. These pipeline
volumes are shown in Figure 5. Note that the pipeline volumes assume a west leg
connection added to the S Orchard Street/S 48th Street intersection. Future 2015 traffic
volumes without the project are given in Figure 6, while 2015 volumes with project
traffic added are shown in Figure 7.

E. Level of Service

A level of service analysis was made of the future peak hour volumes with project
generated trips included. This analysis again involved the use of the HCS2010 program
which is based on specific intersection analysis procedures of the Highway Capacity
Manual. Results for 2015 traffic conditions are shown in Table 3.

As shown in the table, delays at the key intersections would be in the LOS B to LOS D
range with project traffic included.


V. CONCLUSIONS & MITIGATION

The Orchard Industrial Center project proposes to add a 571,200 square foot high
cube/distribution center just east of S Orchard Street at S 46th Street and S 48th Street,
replacing the Hanson Pipe & Products facility that is undergoing demolition work.
Approximately 960 daily trips may be expected, with 63 trips during the AM peak hour
and 69 trips during the PM peak hour. The net increase in trips onto S Orchard Street and

the surrounding road network would be lower due to demolition of the previous
operations on site.

Fairly heavy evening peak hour volumes currently exist along S Orchard Street, with
some mild volumes on the S 46th and S 48th side streets. Sight distance at the access
points is adequate for passenger vehicles and heavy vehicles. Future 2015 delays with
project traffic included are calculated to be in the LOS B to LOS D range, assuming
moderate use of the access to S 48th Street including some heavy vehicle usage for
analysis purposes. Project proponents request that heavy vehicle access to S 48th Street
is not restricted so as to have the option available.

No mitigations are identified at this time.

                                   LEVEL OF SERVICE


The following are excerpts from the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation
Research Board Special Report 209.

Quality of service requires quantitative measures to characterize operational conditions
within a traffic stream. Level of service (LOS) is a quality measure describing
operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally in terms of such service measures
as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and comfort and
convenience.

Six LOS are defined for each type of facility that has analysis procedures available.
Letters designate each level, from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating
conditions and LOS F the worst. Each level of service represents a range of operating
conditions and the driver's perception of those conditions.

Level-of-Service definitions

The following definitions generally define the various levels of service for arterials.

Level of service A represents primarily free-flow operations at average travel speeds,
usually about 90 percent of the free-flow speed for the arterial classification. Vehicles are
seldom impeded in their ability to maneuver in the traffic stream. Delay at signalized
intersections is minimal.

Level of service B represents reasonably unimpeded operations at average travel speeds,
usually about 70 percent of the free-flow speed for the arterial classification. The ability
to maneuver in the traffic stream is only slightly restricted and delays are not bothersome.

Level of service C represents stable operations; however, ability to maneuver and change
lanes in midblock locations may be more restricted than in LOS B, and longer queues,
adverse signal coordination, or both may contribute to lower average travel speeds of
about 50 percent of the average free-flow speed for the arterial classification.

Level of service D borders on a range in which small increases in flow may cause
substantial increases in approach delay and hence decreases in arterial speed. LOS D may
be due to adverse signal progression, inappropriate signal timing, high volumes, or some
combination of these. Average travel speeds are about 40 percent of free-flow speed.

Level of service E is characterized by significant delays and average travel speeds of one-
third the free-flow speed or less. Such operations are caused by some combination of
adverse progression, high signal density, high volumes, extensive delays at critical
intersections, and inappropriate signal timing.




                                             18
                                             18
Level of service F characterizes arterial flow at extremely low speeds, from less than one-
third to one-quarter of the free-flow speed. Intersection congestion is likely at critical
signalized locations, with long delays and extensive queuing.

These definitions are general and conceptual in nature, and they apply primarily to
uninterrupted flow. Levels of service for interrupted flow facilities vary widely in terms
of both the user's perception of service quality and the operational variables used to
describe them.

For each type of facility, levels of service are defined based on one or more operational
parameters that best describe operating quality for the subject facility type. While the
concept of level of service attempts to address a wide range of operating conditions,
limitations on data collection and availability make it impractical to treat the full range of
operational parameters for every type of facility. The parameters selected to define levels
of service for each facility type are called "measures of effectiveness" or "MOE's", and
represent available measures that best describe the quality of operation on the subject
facility type.

Each level of service represents a range of conditions, as defined by a range in the
parameters given. Thus, a level of service is not a discrete condition, but rather a range of
conditions for which boundaries are established.

The following tables describe levels of service for signalized and unsignalized
intersections. Level of service for signalized intersections is defined in terms of average
control delay. Delay is a measure of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption and
lost travel time, as well as time from movements at slower speeds and stops on
intersection approaches as vehicles move up in queue position or slow down upstream of
an intersection. Level of service for unsignalized intersections is determined by the
computed or measured control delay and is determined for each minor movement.

As described in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual, level of service breakpoints for all-
way stop controlled (AWSC) intersections are somewhat different than the criteria used
for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is that drivers expect
different levels of performance from distinct kinds of transportation facilities. The
expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes
than an AWSC intersection. Thus a higher level of control delay is acceptable at a
signalized intersection for the same level of service.

Dear Mr. Blattner:

As requested, we have conducted a geotechnical engineering study for the subject project. The attached report
presents our findings and recommendations for the geotechnical aspects of project design and construction.

Our field exploration indicates the site is underlain by variable fill thicknesses and native glacial till consisting
predominantly of medium dense to very dense, silty sand with gravel. We observed fill overlying native till soils
at 11 of the 21 test pit locations. The fill thicknesses ranged between about 2 feet and 18 feet, with the greatest
thickness observed in the area of the stormwater detention pond in the northern portion of the site. Fill observed
in the proposed building area in the southern portion of the site was generally observed to be dense, and consisted
predominantly of non-organic mineral soil derived from the native till. We observed light to moderate
groundwater seepage in three of the test pits.

Detailed recommendations addressing these issues and other geotechnical design considerations are presented in
the attached report . We trust the information presented is sufficient for your current needs. If you have any
questions or require additional information, please call.

1.0       PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project involves redevelopment of the former Hanson Pipe & Products property with a new industrial
warehouse and supporting infrastructure. A site plan by Innova Architects, dated March 29, 2013 indicates that a
proposed 571 ,200 square-foot warehouse building will occupy the vast majority of the site. The building floor
will be constructed at grade with dock high access shown along the east and west sides of the building. Two 10-
foot high retaining walls are shown along the east site margin, east of the proposed building. Stormwater runoff
from the site will be routed to detention ponds located at the north and south ends of the property.

Building plans are currently not available; however, we expect the structure will be constructed with perimeter
precast concrete wall panels with interior isolated columns supporting the roof structure and a possible
mezzanine level. Based on our experience with similar construction, we expect foundation loading will be light
to moderate with continuous bearing walls caring 6 to 8 kips per foot, and isolated column loadings in the range
of 80 to 200 kips.

The recommendations in the following sections of this report are based on our understanding of the design
features outlined above. We should review design drawings as they become available to verify that our
recommendations have been properly interpreted and to supplement them, if required.


2.0       SCOPE OF WORK

Our work was completed in accordance with our authorized proposal dated March 4, 2013. Using information
obtained from the subsurface investigation and the results of laboratory testing, we performed analyses to
develop geotechnical recommendations for project design and construction. Specifically, this report addresses

                                                                                                   Project No. T-6860


3.0     SITE CONDITIONS


3.1     Surface

The site is an approximately 34.8-acre property located between the right-of-way for South 40th Street and South
48th Street, approximately 600 feet east of South Orchard Street in Tacoma, Washington. The site location is
shown on Figure 1. The site is bordered by the Tacoma Landfill to the north and east, commercial properties to
the west, and South 48th Street and undeveloped property to the south.

Existing site improvements include several large, light industrial buildings and asphalt- and concrete-paved
access and parking areas, gravel-surfaced storage yard areas along the perimeter of the site, and a stonnwater
detention pond in the northwestern corner of the site. A cellular conununications tower occupies a small area
immediately east of the detention pond in the northern portion of the site.

In general, existing site grades are relatively flat, and slope gently down to the north and south from a
topographic high located in the central portion of the site. The elevation of the existing stormwater detention in
the northwestern portion of the site pond is about 15 to 20 feet lower than the adjacent grades to the east and
south. The grade transition between the site and the pond is a slope graded to an inclination of about 2: 1 (H: V).
The northern side of the proposed south detention pond is also an existing fill slope. Based on our observations,
the fill slope appears to be about 10 to 15 feet high with an inclination of about 20 to 35 percent.

Site vegetation is generally limited to young deciduous trees and brush growing at the s ite perimeter; however,
the proposed detention pond area in the southern portion of the site is vegetated with mature coniferous and
deciduous trees and thick brush.


3.2     Soils

The nati ve soils underlying the site are glacial till consisting predominantly of medium dense to very dense, silty
sand with gravel. We observed very dense, unweathered glacial till in 19 of the 21 test pits at depths ranging
from several inches below the ground surface, to about 6 to 17 feet where overlain by fill.

We observed fill overlying native soils at 11 of the test pit locations. The fill thicknesses ranged between about 2
feet and 18 feet, with the greatest thickness observed in Test Pit TP-12 in the northern portion of the site.
Reviews of historical aerial photographs indicate that the 18 feet of fill observed in Test Pit TP-12 is related to
the filling of a ravine that formerly crossed the site. The approximate location of the ravine is shown on Figure 2.
The location of the ravine suggests that much of the existing stormwater detention pond and eastern and southern
pond slopes are constructed in fill.

The fill material generally consists of dense, moist, silty sand with gravel that appears to be derived from the on-
site native soi ls; however, at several test pit locations we observed about two feet to five feet of fi ll consisting of
dense crushed rock. We observed native topsoil underlying the dense fill in several of the test pits in the southern
portion of the site. The thickness of the overlying dense fill at these locations is generally greater than about four
feet.

Review of the Geologic map of the Tacoma South 7.5-Minute Quadrangle, Washington, Troost, K.G. , in review,
and the Geologic map of the Steilacoom 7.5-Minute Quadrangle, Washington, Troost, K.G., Booth, D.B., and
Borden, R.K., in review, show the site consisting of Vashon till (Qvt). This is consistent with our observations.

Detailed descriptions of the conditions observed in our subsurface explorations are presented on the Test Pit Logs
in Appendix A. The approximate locations of the test pits are shown on Figure 2.


3.3        Groundwater

We observed light to moderate groundwater seepage at a depth of approximately 20 feet in Test Pit TP-12, and at
depths of about 5 to 6 feet in Test Pits TP-20 and TP-21 . The seepage is perched above dense to very dense till
in Test Pits TP-20 and TP-21.

The occurrence of perched groundwater is typical for sites underlain by relatively impermeable till and till-like
soils . We expect that perched groundwater levels and flow rates will fluctuate seasonally and will typically reach
their highest levels during and shortly following the wet winter months (October through May). Considering that
our field work was performed during the wet winter months, we do not expect that perched groundwater levels
and flow rates will increase significantly from those observed in the test pits.


3.4        Geologically Hazardous Areas

We evaluated site conditions for the presence of geologic hazards as designated in Section I 3. I 1.710 of the
Tacoma Municipal Code (TMC). The TMC defines geologically hazardous areas as areas susceptible to erosion,
sliding, earthquake, or other geologic events. Geologically hazardous areas include erosion hazard areas,
landslide hazard areas, seismic hazard areas, mine hazard areas, volcanic hazard areas, and tsunami hazard areas.


3.4.1      Erosion Hazard Areas

Section 13. 11.720(1) of the TMC defines erosion hazard areas as areas where the combination of slope and soil
type makes the area susceptible to erosion by water flow, either by precipitation or by water runoff. Erosion
hazard areas include the following:

      I.   Areas w ith high probability of ra pid stream incision, stream bank erosion or coastal erosion, or channel
           migration.
      2.   Areas defined by the Washington Department of Ecology Coastal Zone Atlas as one of the following soil
           areas: Class U (Unstable) includes severe erosion hazards and rapid surface runoff areas, Class Uos
           (Unstable old s lides) includes areas having severe limitations due to s lope, Class Urs (Unstable recent
           slides), and C lass I (Intermed iate).
      3.   Any area characterized by slopes greater than 15 percent; and the following types of geologic units as
           defi ned by draft geologic USGS maps: m (modified land), Af (artificial fill), Qal (alluvium), Qw
           (wetland deposits), Qb (beach deposits), Qtf (tide-flat deposits), Qls (landslide deposits), Qmw (mass-
           wastage deposits), Qf (fan deposits), Qvr and Qvs series of geologic material types (Vashon recessional
           out wash and Steilacoom Gravel), and Qvi (Ice-contact deposits).
      4.   Slopes steeper than 25 percent and a vertical relief of I 0 or more feet.



                                                        Page No. 3
                                                                                                          April 8, 2013
                                                                                                    Project No. T-6860


We did not observe indications of significant erosion on any of the site slopes; however, we observed several
slope areas on-site that appear to be about I 0 feet or more in height and steeper than 25 percent, which meets the
criteria for an erosion hazard area given above in condition number 4. These areas include portions of the cut
slope along the eastern site margin, the south-facing fill slope in the northern portion of the proposed south
detention pond, and the west-facing slope above the east side of the existing north detention pond.

In our opinion, the erosion potential of site soils would be adequately mitigated with proper implementation and
maintenance of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for erosion prevention and sedimentation control in the
planned development area. All BMPs for erosion prevention and sedimentation control will need to be in place
prior to and during site grading activity, and should conform to City of Tacoma requirements.


3.4.2    La11dslide Hazard Areas
Section 13.11.720(2) of the TMC defines lands lide hazard areas as areas potentially subject to landslides based
on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include areas susceptible because of
any combination of bedrock, soil, slope, slope aspect, structure, hydrology, or other factors. Landslide hazard
areas are identified as follows:

    I.   Any area with all three of the following characteristics:
         a.      Slopes steeper than 25 percent and a vertical relief of I 0 or more feet.
         b.      Hillsides intersecting geologic contacts that contain impermeable soils (typically silt and clay)
                 frequently interbedded with permeable granular soils (predominantly sand and gravel) or
                 impermeable soils overla in with penneabl e soils.
         c.      Springs or groundwater seepage.
    2. Any area which has exhibited movement during the Holocene epoch (from 10,000 years ago to present)
       or that are underlain or covered by mass wastage debris of that epoch.
    3. Any area potentially unstable due to rapid stream incision stream bank erosion or undercutting by wave
       action .
    4.   Any area located on an alluvial fan presently subj ect to, or potentially subj ect to, inundati on by debris
         flows or deposition of stream-transported sediments.
    5. Any area where the slope is greater than the angle of repose of the soil.
    6. Any shoreline designated or mapped as Class U, Uos, Urs, or I by the Washington Department of
       Ecology Coastal Zone Atlas .

Conditions meeting the above criteria do not exist at the site.

3.4.3    Seismic Hazard Areas
Section 13.11 .720(3) of the TMC de fines seismic hazard areas as areas subject to severe risk of damage as a
result of seismic- induced settlement, shaking, lateral spreading, surface faulting, slope fail ure, or soil
liquefaction. These conditions occur in "areas underlain by soils of low cohesion or density usually in
association with a sha llow groundwater table. Seismic hazard areas sha ll be as defined by the Washington
Department of Ecology Coastal Zone Atlas (Seismic Hazard Map prepared by GeoEngineers) as: Class U
(Unstable), Class Uos (Unstable old slides), Class Urs (Unstable recent slides), Class I (lntem1ediate), and C lass
M (Modified) as shown in the Seismic I lazard M ap' '.

Based on the soil and groundwater conditions we observed at the site, it is our opinion that there is little to no
risk for damage resulting from soil liquefaction, lateral spreading, or surface faulting. Therefore, in our opinion,
unusual seismic hazard areas do not exist at the site, and design in accordance with local building codes for
determining seismic forces would adequately mitigate impacts associated with ground shaking.


3.4.4   Mine Hazard Areas

Section 13.11.720(4) of the TMC defines mine hazard areas as those areas underlain by or affected by mine
workings such as adits, gangways, tunnels, drifts, or airshafts, and those areas of probable sink holes, gas
releases, or subsidence due to mine workings. Mine workings do not underlie the site.


3.4.5   Volcanic Hazard Areas

Section 13.11.720(5) of the TMC defines volcanic hazard areas as areas subject to pyroclastic flows, lava flows,
debris avalanche, and inundation by debris flows, lahars, mudflows, or related flooding resulting from volcanic
activity. The site is not located in an area that would be impacted by the conditions described above.


3.4.6   Tsunami Hazard Areas

Section 13.11.720(6) of the TMC defines tsunami hazard areas as coastal areas and large lake shoreline areas
susceptible to flooding and inundation as the result of excessive wave action derived from seismic or other
geologic events. The s ite is not located in an area susceptible to tsunamis.


3.5     Seismic Design Parameters

Based on the site soil conditions and our knowledge of the area geology, per C hapter 16 of the 2009 lntem ational
Building Code (IBC), s ite class "C'" should be used in structural design. Based on this site class, in accordance
with the 2009 me, the following parameters should be used in computing seismic forces:

4.0     DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

4.1     General

Based on our study, there are no geotechnical conditions that would preclude the planned development. In our
opinion, the proposed structure can be supported on conventional spread footings bearing on a properly prepared
subgrade consisting of the medium dense to very dense native soils or on structural fill that is placed in
conformance with the recommendations presented in this report. Based on our observations, it is our opinion that
the existing medium dense to dense fill material observed in the southern portion of the site will generally be
suitable for foundation support without significant modification. Floor slabs and pavements can be similarly
supported.

The site soils contain a significant amount of fines and will be difficult to compact as structural fill when too wet
or dry. The ability to use soils from site excavations as structural fill will depend on its moisture content and the
prevailing weather conditions at the time of construction. If grading activities will take place duiing winter or
extended periods of wet weather, the owner should be prepared to import clean granular material for use as
structural fill and backfill. Alternatively, stabi lizing the moisture in the native soil with cement kiln dust (CKD),
cement, or lime can be considered.

Detailed recommendations regarding these issues and other geotechnical design considerations are provided in
the following sections. T hese recommendations should be incorporated into the final design drawings and
construction specifications.


4.2     Site Preparation and Grading

To prepare the site for construction, all vegetation, organic surface soils, and other deleterious materia l should be
stripped and removed from the site. Demolition of existing structures should include removal of existing
foundations, floor slabs, and other buried utilities. Abandoned utility pipes that fall outside of new building areas
can be left in place provided they are sealed to prevent intrusion of groundwater seepage and soil. Given current
site conditions, we expect minimal stripping will be requi red to remove the vegetation.

Once c learing and grubbing operations are complete, cut and fi ll operations to establish desired building
elevations can be initiated. Prior to placing fill , we recommend proofrolling all exposed surfaces to determine if
any isolated soft and yielding areas are present. In addition, we recommend mechanically compacting all
foundation subgrades consisting of the existing fill soi l to assure uniformity of the material as a bearing subgrade.
A representative of Terra Associates, Inc . should examine all bearing surfaces to verify that conditions
encountered are as anticipated and are suitable for placement of structural fill or direct support of building and
pavement elements.

If excessively yielding areas are observed and the subgrade cannot be stabi lized in place by compaction,
additional removal of the existing fill will need to be considered. Alternatively, the use of a geotextile
reinforcing/separation fabric, such as Mirafi 500X or equivalent, can be considered in conjunction with the clean
granular structural fill to limit overexcavation and establish a stable subgrade. The final determination of
appropriate subgrade improvements, if needed, shou ld be based on field conditions observed by the project
geotechnical engineer during construction.

                                                                                                 Project No. T-6860


The native soils and existing mineral soil fills observed at the site contain a sufficient amount of fines (silt and
clay size particles), which will make them difficult to compact as structural fill if they are too wet or too dry.
Accordingly, the ability to use these soils from site excavations as structural fill will depend on their moisture
content and the prevailing weather conditions when site grading activities take place. Soils that are too wet to
properly compact could be dried by aeration during dry weather conditions, or mixed with an additive such as
cement, cement kiln dust (CKD), or lime to stabilize the soil and facilitate compaction. If an additive is used,
additional Best Management Practices (BMPs) for its use will need to be incorporated into the Temporary
Erosion and Sedimentation Control (TESC) plan for the project.

If grading activities are planned during the wet winter months, or if they are initiated during the summer and
extend into fall and winter, the owner should be prepared to import wet weather structural fill. For this purpose,
we recommend importing a granular soil that meets the following grading requirements:

                                U.S. Sieve Size                     Percent Passin2
                                   6 inches                               100
                                     No.4                            75 maximum
                                   No. 200                           5 maximum*

                     *Based on the 3/4-inch fraction.

Prior to use, Terra Associates, Inc. should examine and test all materials imported to the site for use as structural
fil I.

Structural fill should be placed in uniform loose layers not exceeding 12 inches and compacted to a minimum of
95 percent of the soil 's maximum dry density, as determined by American Society for Testing and Material s
(ASTM) Test Designation D-698 (Standard Proctor). The moisture content of the soil at the time of compaction
should be within two percent of its optimum, as determined by this ASTM standard. In nonstructural areas, the
degree of compaction can be reduced to 90 percent.


4.3     Excavation

All excavations at the site associated with confined spaces, such as utility trenches, must be completed in
accordance with local , state, and federal requirements. Based on the Washington State Safety and Health
Administration (WSHA) regulations, the existing fill soils and the medium dense to dense native soils would
typically be classified as Type C soils. The unweathered, dense to very dense ti ll soil would typically be
classified as Type A soil.

Accordingly, for temporary excavations of more than 4 feet and less than 20 feet in depth, the side slopes in Type
C soils should be laid back at a slope inclination of 1.5: 1 (Horizontal:Vertical) or flatter. Temporary excavations
in Type A soils can be laid back al an inclination of0.75:1 or flatter. If there is insufficient room lo complete the
excavations in this manner, using temporary shoring to support the excavations may need lo be considered. A
properly designed and installed shoring trench box can be used to support utility trench excavation s idewalls.

Based on our observations, we do not expect that significant groundwater seepage will be encountered in site
excavations. Based on our experience, it is our opinion that the volume of water and rate of flow into site
excavations should be relatively minor and would not be expected to impact the stability of the excavations when
completed, as described above. Conventional sump pumping procedures along with a system of collection
trenches, if necessary, should be capable of maintaining a relatively dry excavation for constrnction purposes.

This information is provided solely for the benefit of the owner and other design consultants, and should not be
construed to imply that Terra Associates, Inc. assumes responsibility for job site safety. It is understood that job
site safety is the sole responsibility of the project contractor.


4.4     Foundations

In our opinion, the building may be supported on conventional spread footing foundations bearing on subgrades
prepared as recommended in Section 4.2 of this report. Foundations exposed to the weather should bear at a
minimum depth of 1.5 feet below adjacent grades for frost protection. Interior foundations can be supported at
any convenient depth below the floor slab.

We recommend designing foundations for a net allowable bearing capacity of 3,000 psf. For short-term loads,
such as wind and seismic, a one-third increase in this allowable capacity can be used. Total and differential
settlements should not exceed one-inch and one-half inch, respectively. The predicted settlements would be
immediate in nature occurring as building loads are applied.

The potential for some differential settlement exists where foundation support transitions from the very dense
native till to a fill subgrade. This settlement would also occur immediately during load application. In our
opinion, differential settlement resulting from this subgrade condition is not expected to be significant; however,
the potential for this differential settlement to occur can be reduced by stiffening the footings across the area
where the subgrade soils transition.

For designing foundations to resist lateral loads, a base friction coefficient of 0.35 can be used. Passive earth
pressures acting on the sides of the footings can also be considered. We recommend calculating this lateral
resistance using an equivalent fluid weight of 300 pcf. We do not recommend including the upper 12 inches of
soi l in this computation because it can be affected by weather or disturbed by future grading activity. This value
assu mes the fou ndation will be backfilled with structural fill, as described in Section 4.2 of this report. The
values recommended include a safety factor of 1.5.


4.5     Slab-on-Grade Construction

Slab-on-grade floors may be supported on subgrades prepared as recommended in Section 4.2 of this report.
Immediately below the floor slabs, we recommend placing a four-inch thick capillary break layer of clean, free-
draining, coarse sand or fine gravel that has less than three percent passing the No. 200 sieve. This material will
reduce the potential for upward capillary movement of water through the underlying soil and subsequent wetting
of the floor slabs.

                                                                                                     April 8, 2013
                                                                                               Project No. T-6860


The capillary break layer will not prevent moisture intrusion through the slab caused by water vapor
transmission. Where moisture by vapor transmission is undesirable, such as covered floor areas, a common
practice is to place a durable plastic membrane on the capillary break layer and then cover the membrane with a
layer of clean sand or fine gravel to protect it from damage during construction, and aid in uniform curing of the
concrete slab. It should be noted that if the sand or gravel layer overlying the membrane is saturated prior to
pouring the slab, it will be ineffective in assisting uniform curing of the slab, and can actually serve as a water
supply for moisture transmission through the slab and affecting floor coverings. Therefore, in our opinion,
covering the membrane with a layer of sand or gravel should be avoided if floor slab construction occurs during
the wet winter months and the layer cannot be effectively drained. We recommend floor designers and
contractors refer to the 2003 American Concrete Institute (ACI) Manual of Concrete Practice, Part 2, 302.lR-96,
for further information regarding vapor barrier installation below slab-on-grade floors.

We recommend the floors be designed using a subgrade modulus (ks) of 200 pounds per cubic inch (pci).


4.6     Retaining Walls

The magnitude of earth pressure development on retaining walls will partly depend on the quality of the wall
backfill. We recommend placing and compacting wall backfill as structural fill. Below improved areas, such as
pavements or floor slabs, the backfill should be compacted to a minimum of 95 percent of its maximum dry unit
weight, as determined by ASTM Test Designation D-69 8 (Standard Proctor). In unimproved areas, the relative
compaction can be reduced to 90 percent. To guard against hydrostatic pressure development, wall drainage
must also be installed. A typical recommended wall drainage detail is shown on Figure 3.

With wall backfill placed and compacted as recommended and drainage properly installed, we recommend
designing unrestrained walls for an active earth pressure equivalent to a fluid weighing 35 pcf. For restrained
walls, an additional uniform lateral pressure of I 00 psf should be included. These values assume a horizontal
backfill condition and that no other surcharge loading, such as traffic, sloping embankments, or adjacent
buildings, will act on the wall. If such conditions exist, then the imposed loading must be included in the wall
design. Friction at the base of foundations and passive earth pressure will provide resistance to these lateral
loads. Values for these parameters are provided in Section 4.4.

Alternative wall types such as gravity block walls and mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) walls may also be
suitable depending on final design grades and wall locations. We can design or provide soi l design parameters
for a design build approach for these alternative wall systems, if requested.


4.7      Stormwater Detention Ponds

As discussed, stormwater detention ponds are proposed for the northern and southern portions of the site. Pond
elevations and geometry are currently not available; however, based on our observations, we anticipate that the
pond bottoms will consist predominantly of cuts in to the existing site soi ls, with pond side slopes consisting of
both cuts and fill berms.

                                                                                                  Project No. T-6860


The native, dense to very dense till soil observed at the site will typically be suitable for containing stored water;
however, as discussed, we observed about 18 feet of fill in a filled ravine that crosses the proposed north pond
area, and the northern side of the proposed south pond is an approximately 10- to 15-foot high fill slope. Due to
the potential for variations in the consistency and relatively density of the existing fill materials, we recommend
that the geotechnical engineer verify the suitability of pond subgrades consisting of the existing fill material.
Any pond subgrade areas consisting of the existing fill materials should be mechanically compacted in place to
provide uniformity in the relative density of the pond subgrade. If it is determined that existing fill soils exposed
in the pond do not contain at least 20 percent fines, they should be sub-cut at least 18 inches, and sealed with
compacted till having at least 20 percent fines.

If fill berms will be constructed, the berm locations should be stripped of topsoil, duff, and soils containing organic
material prior to the placement of fill. The fill berms should be constructed by placing structural fill in layers no
more than 12 inches thick, compacting each layer to a minimum of 95 percent relative compaction, as determined
by ASTM Test Designation D-1557 (Modified Proctor). Material used to construct pond berms should consist of
predominately granular soils with a maximum size of 3 inches and a minimum of 20 percent fines. The results of
laboratory testing indicate that soils meeting this gradational requirement exist on-site. Regardless, Terra
Associates, Inc. should examine and test all on-site or imported materials proposed for use as berm fill prior to theiI
use.

Because of exposure to fluctuating stored water levels, soils exposed on the interior side slopes of the ponds may
be subject to some risk of periodic shallow instability or sloughing. Establishing interior slopes at a 3: 1 gradient
will significantly reduce or eliminate this potential. Exterior berm slopes and interior slopes above the maximum
water surface should be graded to a finished inclination no steeper than 2: 1. Finished slope faces should be
thoroughly compacted and vegetated to guard against erosion.


4.8       Drainage

Surface

Final exterior grades should promote free and positive drainage away from the building at all times. Water must
not be allowed to pond or collect adjacent to foundations or within the immediate building areas. If a positive
drainage gradient cannot be provided, surface water should be collected adjacent to the structures and disposed to
appropriate storm facilities.


Subsurface

We recommend installing perimeter foundation drains adj acent to shallow foundations where paved surfaces do
not extend to buildi ng perimeter and positive drainage away from the structure is not provided. The drains can be
laid to grade at an invert elevation equivalent to the bottom of footing grade. The drains can consist of four-inch
diameter perforated PVC pipe that is enveloped in washed %-inch gravel sized drainage aggregate. The
aggregate shou ld extend six inches above and to the sides of the pipe. Roof and foundation drains should be
tightlined separately to the stonn drains. All drains should be provided with cleanouts at easily accessible
locations.

4.9        Utilities

Utility pipes should be bedded and backfilled in accordance with American Public Works Association (APWA),
or City of Tacoma specifications. At minimum, trench backfill should be placed and compacted as structural fill,
as described in Section 4.2 of this report. As noted, soils excavated on-site should be suitable for use as backfill
material. However, the vast majority of the site soils are fine grained and moisture sensitive; therefore, moisture
conditioning may be necessary to facilitate proper compaction. If utility construction takes place during the
winter, it may be necessary to import suitable wet weather fill for utility trench backfilling.


4.10       Pavements

Pavement subgrades should be prepared as described in the Section 4.2 of this report. Regardless of the degree
of relative compaction achieved, the subgrade must b e firm and relatively unyielding before paving. The
subgrade should be proofrolled with heavy rubber-tired construction equipment such as a loaded 10-yard dump
truck to verify this condition.

The pavement design section is dependent upon the supporting capability of the subgrade soils and the traffic
conditions to which it will be subjected. We expect that traffic at the facility will consist of cars and light trucks,
along with heavy traffic in the form of tractor-trailer rigs. For design considerations, we have assumed traffic in
parking and in car/light truck access pavement areas can be represented by an 18-kip Equivalent Single Axle
Loading (ESAL) of 50,000 over a 20-year design life. For heavy traffic pavement areas, we have assumed an
ESAL of 300,000 would be representative of the expected loading. These ESALs represent loading
approximately equivalent to 3 and 18, loaded (80,000 pound GVW) tractor-trailer rigs traversing the pavement
daily in each area, respectively.

With a stable subgrade prepared as recommended, we recommend the following pavement sections:

Light Traffic and Parking:

       ·   Two inches of hot mix asphalt (HMA) over four inches of crushed rock base (CRB)

       ·   Two inches of HMA over three inches of asphalt-treated base (ATB)

Heavy Traffic:

       ·   Three inches of HMA over six inches of CRB

       ·   Three inches of I-IMA over three inches of ATB

The paving materials used should confon11 to the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT)
specifications for Yi-inch class HMA, ATB, and CRB.

Long-term pavement performance will depend on surface drainage. A poorly-drained pavement section will be
subject to premature failure as a result of surface water infiltrati ng into the subgrade soils and reducing their
supporting capability. For optimum pavement performance, we recommend surface drainage gradients of at least
two percent. Some degree of longitudinal and transverse cracking of the pavement surface should be expected
over time. Regular maintenance should be planned to seal cracks when they occur.



5.0     ADDITIONAL SERVICES

Terra Associates, Inc. should review the final design drawings and specifications in order to verify that earthwork
and foundation recommendations have been properly interpreted and implemented in project design. We should
also provide geotechnical services during construction to observe compliance with our design concepts,
specifications, and recommendations. This will allow for design changes if subsurface conditions differ from
those anticipated prior to the start of construction.

                           FIELD EXPLORATION AND LABORATORY TESTING

On March 21 and 22, 2013, we investigated subsurface conditions at the site by excavating 21 test pits to depths
ranging from about 4 to 21 feet below existing surface grades using a track-mounted excavator. The test pit
locations are shown on Figure 2. The test pit locations were approximately determined in the field by sighting
and pacing from existing surface features. The Test Pit Logs are presented on Figures A-2 through A-22.

An engineering geologist from our office maintained a Jog of each test pit as it was excavated, classified the soil
conditions encountered, and obtained representative soil samples. All soil samples were visually classified in the
field in accordance with the Unified Soil Classification System. A copy of this classification is presented as
Figure A-1.

Representative soil samples obtained from the test pits were placed in sealed plastic bags and taken to our
laboratory for further examination and testing. The moisture content of each sample was measured and is
reported on the Test Pit Logs. Grain size analyses were performed on four of the soil samples. The results are
shown on Figures A-23 and A-24.

Main Street Traffic Study                             i                                     City of Pine Island
      1. Introduction and Summary
                a. Purpose of Report and Study Objectives
                     Goodhue County commissioned a Traffic Operations Study of Pine
                     Island's Main Street (designated as County State Aid Highway 62)
                     in July 2005. Based on safety and operational deficiencies
                     identified in the Traffic Operations Study, Main Street was
                     reconstructed with a new configuration during the summer/fall of
                     2007. These improvements appeared to have improved the safety
                     and traffic operations along Main Street. However, on March 30,
                     2010 there was a vehicle-pedestrian crash at the Main Street/2nd
                     Street SW intersection.

                     The City of Pine Island has commissioned this traffic study to
                     identify measures that could be taken to improve the safety along
                     Main Street. The study objectives are:
                          i. Document the existing vehicle and pedestrian traffic patterns
                             at the Main Street/2nd Street SW and Main Street/3rd Street
                             SW intersections.
                         ii. Determine if additional levels of traffic control are needed at
                             either study intersection.
                        iii. Identify measures that could be taken at the study
                             intersections to increase pedestrian safety.
                        iv. Recommend improvements.

                b. Executive Summary
                     This study reviewed the traffic operations and pedestrian safety of
                     the Main Street/2nd Street South and Main Street/3rd Street South
                     intersections in Pine Island, MN. It was found the Main Street/2nd
                     Street South and Main Street/3rd Street South intersections
                     currently operate acceptably at Level of Service B or better during
                     the weekday rush hours and they do not meet warrants (per the
                     MnMUTCD) for increased levels of traffic control. Therefore,
                     increases in the level of traffic control are not justified at this time.

                     Crashes have decreased on the corridor since Main Street was
                     reconstructed, however there are two known pedestrian crashes at
                     the Main Street/2nd Street intersection since the reconstruction was
                     completed in 2007. This is a high number of pedestrian crashes for
                     this intersection and safety enhancements are justified.

                     Based on the feasible alternatives analyzed in this report, a
                     combination of the following strategies is recommended:
                         More on-street, centerline pedestrian signs should be
                           installed along Main Street.

                               Bumpout corner extensions should be painted on Main
                               Street at the 2nd Street and 3rd Street intersections. Planters
                               should be placed in the bumpouts to keep vehicles out, but
                               to allow for reasonable snow removal.
                               The southbound right turn lane should be eliminated at the
                               two study intersections.
                               The through lanes should be restriped with 11 foot widths.
                               Rubber medians should be placed at the intersections to
                               provide a four foot median refuge between the through lane
                               and left turn lane. The left turn lane should be 11 feet wide
                               next to the median and 15 feet wide at midblock locations.

                  Pedestrian safety is a difficult thing to quantify, but implementing
                  these recommendations will decrease the amount of time pedestrians
                  spend on the street at crossings, will make them more visible, and
                  will naturally lower vehicle speeds on Main Street. Speed limits
                  should also be strictly enforced along Main Street.

                  The physical environment is only one component of pedestrian
                  safety. An educational and enforcement campaign should be
                  undertaken to make motorists and pedestrians aware of their
                  obligations, however this campaign is outside the scope of this
                  engineering document.

      2. Analysis of Existing Conditions
                a. Transportation Network Characteristics
                     Main Street is designated as County
                     State Aid Highway 62 and has a 30
                     mph speed limit per Minnesota
                     Statute 169.14. Figure 2.1 shows
                     the existing layout of the study
                     corridor. There is currently angled
                     parking on the west side of Main
                     Street and parallel parking on the
                     east side between 2nd Street and 4th
                     Street. Main Street is approximately
                     82 feet wide from curb to curb.

                     The intersection at 3rd Street is
                     controlled with all way stop signs
                     while the intersection at 2nd Street is
                     controlled with stop signs on the side
                     street only. Northbound Main Street
                     has one shared through/right turn
                     lane and a center two-way left turn
                     lane.     Southbound Main Street
                     shares the center two-way left turn
                     lane and has one through lane. A
                     southbound right turn lane is also
                     striped on Main Street as a buffer for
                     vehicles backing out of the angled        Figure 2.1 ­ Existing Conditions
                     parking. No turn lanes are provided
                     on 2nd Street or 3rd Street.

                     City staff members assist students cross the Main Street/3rd Street
                     and Main Street intersections for an hour to an hour and a half each
                     morning and afternoon while school is in session. The staff
                     member at the Main Street/3rd Street intersection also directs traffic
                     for the approximate ten minute vehicle surge before school starts
                     and after school ends.

                     Concrete sidewalks are provided along all of the streets at the
                     study intersections. Crosswalks are provided with colored concrete
                     at the two study intersections. On pavement, centerline "yield to
                     pedestrian" signs are also placed on Main Street near the study
                     intersections.

                b. Capacity Analysis
                     According to Mn/DOT traffic flow maps, Main Street carries an
                     average annual daily traffic volume of 7,700 vehicles per day. The
                     capacity of a three lane roadway such as Main Street (discounting
                     the southbound right turn lane) is approximately 15,000 vehicles
                     per day according to calculations based on the Highway Capacity
                     Manual. The corridor currently has adequate capacity for its traffic
                     volumes.

                     A twelve hour turning movement count was conducted at each
                     study intersection from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, May 6,
                     2010. Vehicles and pedestrians were counted. The data is
                     contained in 15 minute intervals in Appendix A. Appendix A also
                     shows the a.m. and p.m. peak hour turning movement/pedestrian
                     crossing volumes.

                                         An intersection capacity analysis was
                                         conducted for the existing intersections per the
                                         Highway Capacity Manual. Intersections are
                                         assigned a "Level of Service" letter grade for
                                         the peak hour of traffic based on the number of
                                         lanes at the intersection, traffic volumes, and
                                         traffic control. Level of Service A (LOS A)
                                         represents light traffic flow (free flow
                                         conditions) while Level of Service F (LOS F)
                                         represents heavy traffic flow (over capacity
                                         conditions). LOS D at intersections is typically
                                         considered acceptable in Minnesota. Individual
                                         movements are also assigned LOS grades.
                                         One or more individual movements typically
                                         operate at LOS F when the overall intersection
                                         is operating acceptably at LOS D. The pictures
                                         on the left represent some of the LOS grades
                                         (from a signal controlled intersection in San
                                         Jose, CA). These LOS grades represent the
                                         overall intersection operation, not individual
                                         movements.

                     The Main Street/2nd Street intersection operates acceptably at LOS
                     A (LOS C for the worst operating movement) in the a.m. peak hour
                     and LOS A (LOS B for the worst operating movement) in the p.m.
                     peak hour. The Main Street/3rd Street intersection operates
                     acceptably at LOS B (LOS C for the worst operating movement) in
                     both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours. These results are based on the
                     existing traffic control and lane configurations as shown in Figure
                     2.1 along with the existing turning movement volumes (as shown in



Main Street Traffic Study                      4                             City of Pine Island
                     Appendix A). The LOS calculations were done using SYNCHROTM
                     software and the complete LOS calculations, which include grades
                     for individual movements, are included in Appendix B.

                c. Traffic Control Warrant Analysis
                     Installation of traffic control devices is governed in Minnesota by the
                     Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MnMUTCD).
                     A warrant analysis was conducted for each study intersection per
                     the MnMUTCD. These results are based on the existing traffic
                     control and lane configurations as shown in Figure 2.1 along with
                     the existing turning movement volumes (as shown in Appendix A).
                     The complete warrant analyses for each study intersection are
                     contained in Appendix C.

                     Currently, neither intersection meets any of the warrants for all way
                     stop sign control or traffic signal control. Based on the capacity
                     calculations in the preceding section and not meeting warrants, the
                     level of traffic control should not be increased at either intersection.

                     It should be noted a crossing guard/traffic control officer directs
                     traffic for about ten minutes in the morning and afternoon at the
                     Main Street/3rd Street intersection to facilitate traffic to and from the
                     school complex east of the intersection. The all way stop sign
                     control at the intersection facilitates the crossing guard/traffic
                     control officer and should not be removed.

                d. Lighting Analysis
                     A new street lighting system was installed in 2007 as part of the
                     Main Street reconstruction project. The lights were designed by a
                     licensed electrical engineer and are assumed to meet minimum
                     lighting standards. The city may investigate the adequacy of the
                     lighting further, but it is outside the scope of this traffic study.

                e. Parking Analysis
                     City staff has collected parking usage data near the study
                     intersection (see Appendix D). Based on the usage data, the city is
                     implementing two hour parking limits along Main Street from the
                     river north of 2nd Street south to 4th Street. The two hour parking
                     limit will also be implemented on 2nd Street east and west of Main
                     Street, as well as within the parking lots east and west of Main
                     Street between 2nd Street and 3rd Street. An underutilized parking
                     lot on the east side of Main Street, south of 3rd Street will be
                     designated for employee use (employees of the businesses along
                     Main Street as well as City Hall employees). This will free the
                     prime parking stalls on Main Street for patrons and also discourage
                     high school students from parking on Main Street. In order for this



Main Street Traffic Study                        5                               City of Pine Island
                     change to be effective, the City will need to enforce the parking
                     restrictions.

                     The angled parking on the west side of Main Street from 2nd Street
                     to 4th Street is of noteworthy because there have been discussions
                     of converting the angled parking to parallel parking, which would
                     match the parking on the east side of Main Street. Hourly parking
                     data was collected on Thursday, May 20, 2010 and Tuesday, May
                     25, 2010. Figure 2.2. shows the occupied parking stalls from 8:00
                     a.m. to 7:00 p.m. along with the capacity with angled parking (18
                     stalls on each block face) and the capacity with parallel parking (13
                     stalls on each block face). The data in the Appendix shows ample
                     parking capacity within downtown Pine Island, but the angled
                     parking on Main Street between 2nd and 3rd Street was well utilized
                     on Thursday, May 20th.

                f. Crash Analysis
                     Goodhue County commissioned a Traffic Operations Study of Pine
                     Island's Main Street (designated as County State Aid Highway 62)
                     in July 2005. Based on high crash rates identified in that study,
                     Main Street was redesigned with a focus on safety and Main Street
                     was reconstructed during the summer/fall of 2007.

                     Since the reconstruction affected traffic during 2007, comparing
                     crashes from 2006 (before construction) to crashes in 2008 (after
                     construction) provides a valid safety comparison. Also, crash
                     records are not available yet for 2009 or 2010 in the Minnesota
                     Crash Mapping Analysis Tool database.

                     There were no crashes at the Main Street/3rd Street intersection in
                     2006 or 2008, so no change in safety was experienced at that study
                     intersection. In 2006, there were five crashes at the Main Street/2nd
                     Street intersection. In 2008, crashes at the Main Street/2nd Street
                     intersection dropped to three (one rear end crash, one involving a
                     right turning vehicle, and one involving a pedestrian).

                     According to the Minnesota Motor Vehicle Crash Facts, 2008 report
                     prepared by the Minnesota Department of Public Safety there were:
                         79,095 crashes in 2008 with 945 (1.2%) of them involving
                           pedestrians
                         455 people killed in car crashes in 2008 with 25 (5.5%) of
                           them being pedestrians

                     Pedestrian crashes are a rare event in Minnesota since they are
                     involved in about 1% of the overall crashes; however they are
                     significant since they account for more than 5% of the crash
                     fatalities.

                     Crashes are down overall at the study intersections since Main
                     Street's reconstruction, but it is concerning that one of the crashes
                     in 2008 involved a pedestrian and there was another pedestrian
                     crash in March 2010. Measures should be taken on Main Street to
                     enhance pedestrian safety.


      3. Possible Pedestrian Safety Enhancements
           The Transportation Research Board's National Cooperative Highway
           Research Program (NCHRP) Report 500: Guidance for Implementation of
           the AASHTO Strategic Highway Safety Plan Volume 10: A Guide for
           Reducing Collisions Involving Pedestrians provides strategies that can be
           employed to reduce the number of collisions involving pedestrians. The

           strategies are focused on (1) reducing speeds, (2) improving sight lines,
           (3) reducing exposure to traffic, and (4) education/enforcement activities.

           Based on the analyses in the previous sections, the speed limit cannot be
           changed and the current level of traffic control is appropriate. This section
           will focus on physical measures that will address the first three safety
           strategies listed. The city is encouraged to pursue educational and
           enforcement activities, but those strategies are outside the purview of this
           engineering document.

           Pedestrian crashes are rare events and we were not able to identify any
           sources that quantify the effectiveness of measures in reducing pedestrian
           crash rates. This section will identify measures that could enhance safety
           along Main Street and we rank their effectiveness based on our
           experience. We will also rank each measure based on cost and ease of
           implementation. Each criterion will be ranked on a scale of 1 to 5:
               Effectiveness ­ 5 being highly effective, 1 being slightly effective in
                  reducing pedestrian crashes
               Cost ­ 5 being inexpensive (less than $5,000), 1 being expensive
                  (more than $25,000) as ranked per intersection or installation
               Ease of Implementation ­ 5 being a strategy that could be
                  implemented within a month and 1 being a strategy that would take
                  at least six months to implement.

           On Street Pedestrian Signs
           Pine Island already deploys these pedestrian signs on the centerline of
                              Main Street. This strategy would be to also have
                              them installed at the approach to each intersection
                              from the river north of 2nd Street to 4th Street on the
                              south. These signs tighten the feel of the road, which
                              results in drivers typically driving at lower speeds.

           Dynamic Speed Signs
           Dynamic speed signs are typically installed at transition zones from high
           speed environments to low speed environments. They grab the motorists
                              attention and haven proven to lower speeds near the
                              signs. These speeds could be installed at the
                              gateways to downtown ­ on Main Street south of the
                              river for southbound traffic and north of 5th Street for
                              northbound traffic.

           Push Button Activated Pedestrian Crossing Signs
           The beacons on these signs flash when a pedestrian pushes the button on
           the post. This brings attention to the pedestrian and lets the drivers know
           the pedestrian is there. A major drawback is that pedestrians often
                                choose not to push the button, limiting their
                                effectiveness (there are more expensive versions
                                that automatically attempt to detect the pedestrians,
                                but they are not widely used). These signs could be
                                installed at each crosswalk.

           HAWK Pedestrian Signal
           The HAWK crosswalk is a unique system that has proven to be safer and
           more effective than conventional crosswalk designs. Mn/DOT has
           installed a HAWK system in St. Cloud and is currently studying its
           effectiveness. According to the Mn/DOT's website, "The city of Tuscon,
           Arizona currently is operating more than 60 HAWK systems and has found
           this new crossing system to be effective for the motorist, safer for the
           pedestrian and less costly to build than full blown traffic signal systems.
           The systems are also more energy efficient than traditional signal systems
           as the vehicle signal heads go black when the system is not in use. The
           unique double red signal display above a single yellow display gets the
                                                  motorist's attention by the unusual
                                                  shape of the display cluster."

           Speed Table
           Raising the elevation of an intersection a couple of inches (with a safe
           transition up to it) is called a speed table. It is a measure used to slow
                                                   traffic and make motorists aware of
                                                   the transition into an intersection.
                                                   Drainage and pavement markings
                                                   are critical to ensuring a successful
                                                   design.

           Curb Extension ­ Bumpout
           Extending the corner out to the edge of the parking lane is called a bump
           out. This treatment shortens the distance the pedestrians are on the
           street. It also slows traffic by narrowing the road. They are typically part
           of a landscaping/beautification project to take advantage of the extra
                                                       sidewalk space.       Drainage
                                                       needs     to   be     designed
                                                       appropriately and they make
                                                       snow plowing more difficult.

           Painted Bumpout with Planters
           Same concept as the above bumpout, but done with paint and planters.
           Added benefits are it allows you to try out the treatment, is easier for snow
           removal, can provide enhanced beautification, allows the use of the same
           stormwater sewer system, and allows for even narrower lanes because
           you don't need to provide the extra two feet of curb reaction distance as
                                                        required by State Aid design
                                                        rules.

           Median Island
           Adding a median island next to each left turn lane would provide a refuge
           for pedestrians so they could cross half the road, look the other direction,
           and then continue when safe. This provides a safer, two step crossing
           and makes the pedestrian more visible to motorists. Stormwater drainage
           needs to be accounted for in the design. These may inhibit large farm
                                               implements and fire trucks, which may
                                               need to be accommodated on Main
                                               Street.

           Rubber Materials for Islands/Curbing
           Traffic Logix makes rubber products that are fastened to the pavement
           with lag bolts. These can be used as an alternative to permanent
           bumpouts or permanent islands. These are typically cheaper than a
           permanent solution and can be installed so water can flow around them.
           The material cost for the curbing is approximately $17 a lineal foot and
           each rubber median pad is about $60.

           Narrowing Lanes
           11 foot lanes are the minimum allowed by State Aid rules (with two foot
           reaction zones next to curbs). Narrowing driving lanes is proven to slow
           traffic because motorists are less comfortable. They also make the
           crossing distance shorter for pedestrians.

           Eliminating the Southbound Right Turn Lane
           The right turn lane is not needed from a capacity standpoint, but that
           space allows the anlge parked vehicles to back out of the stalls without
           entering the through traffic (a safety consideration). If bumpouts are
           implemented, it would be prudent to eliminate the southbound right turn
           lanes at 2nd and 3rd to reduce the pedestrian crossing distance.


           Converting the Angled Parking to Parallel Parking
           The through lanes on Main Street are offset to the east, which provides a
           wide and asymmetrical corridor. This is not standard and could lead to
           motorist confusion. If bumpouts are implemented and the angled parking
           is converted to parallel parking, a more standard (centered) corridor could
           be implemented. This would allow those crossing Main Street in the
           westbound direction to spend more time in a larger bumpout, making them
           more visible to motorists.

           Street Lighting
           The City is studying the existing lighting to make sure it meets standards.
           If the lighting is found to be substandard, lighting improvements should be
           considered at the intersections.

           Crosswalks
           Colored concrete is installed at the intersections to delineate the
           crosswalks. This should be adequate, but adding painted "zebra" style
           crosswalks over the colored concrete could be considered to increase
           their visibility.

           Summary of Rankings
           Figure 3-1 shows the rankings of each strategy in table form. Items
           receiving a ten or higher are considered good candidates for
           implementation.

             Figure 3.1 ­ Ranking of Pedestrian Enhancement Strategies



      4. Conclusions and Recommendations
           It was found the Main Street/2nd Street South and Main Street/3rd Street
           South intersections currently operate acceptably at Level of Service B or
           better during the weekday rush hours and they do not meet warrants (per
           the MnMUTCD) for increased levels of traffic control.                   Therefore,
           increases in the level of traffic control are not justified at this time.

           Crashes have decreased on the corridor since Main Street was
           reconstructed, however there are two known pedestrian crashes at the
           Main Street/2nd Street intersection since the reconstruction was completed
           in 2007. This is a high number of pedestrian crashes for this intersection
           and safety enhancements are justified.

           Based on the feasible alternatives analyzed in this report, a combination of
           the following strategies is recommended:
               More on-street, centerline pedestrian signs should be installed
                   along Main Street.
               Bumpouts should be painted on Main Street at the 2nd Street and
                   3rd Street intersections. Planters should be placed in the bumpouts
                   to keep vehicles out, but to allow for reasonable snow removal.
               The southbound right turn lane should be eliminated at the two
                   study intersections.
               The through lanes should be restriped with 11 foot widths.
               Rubber medians should be placed at the intersections to provide a
                   four foot median refuge between the through lane and left turn lane.
                   The left turn lane should be 11 feet wide next to the median and 15
                   feet wide at midblock locations.

        Also, an education and enforcement campaign should be undertaken to
        make motorists and pedestrians aware of their obligations. Speed limits
        should also be strictly enforced along Main Street.

    Note - The Highway Capacity Manual methodology                                            does not model all way
    stop intersections with more than two lanes of                                            approach. The south-
    bound approach at the intersection was modeled                                            with two lanes (instead
    of the existing three lanes), which results in                                            a more conservative
    analysis.

    Note - The Highway Capacity Manual methodology                                              does not model all way
    stop intersections with more than two lanes of                                              approach. The south-
    bound approach at the intersection was modeled                                              with two lanes (instead
    of the existing three lanes), which results in                                              a more conservative
    analysis.

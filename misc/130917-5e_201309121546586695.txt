                                                                 Agenda Item No. 5(E)



Date:          September 17, 2013
To:            El Cerrito City Council
From:          Yvetteh Ortiz, Interim Public Works Director / City Engineer
Subject:       Various Traffic and Parking Revisions

ACTION REQUESTED
Adopt three separate resolutions authorizing the Public Works Director/City Engineer
to:

1. Establish all-way stops at the following intersections
       a. Barrett Avenue at Arlington Boulevard
       b. Stockton Avenue at Ashbury Avenue
       c. Central Avenue at Ashbury Avenue
2. Install a stop sign on Curry Avenue at Pomona Avenue
3. Install 40 feet of green curb marking in front of 10422 San Pablo Avenue

DISCUSSION
The Public Works Department has received requests from residents and businesses to
evaluate various traffic control and parking revisions as discussed below.
Establishment of All-Way Stops
All-way (also known as multi-way) stop control can be useful as a safety measure at
intersections if certain traffic conditions exist. The primary purpose of an all-way stop
is to assign right-of-way. All-way stop signs are the most effective when the traffic
volumes on all the approaches to the intersection are near equal. The greater the
difference between the traffic volumes on the major street compared to the traffic
volume on the minor street, the less effective the signs will be. Safety concerns
associated with all-way stops include pedestrians, bicyclists, and all road users expecting
other road users to stop. As such, an intersection must meet one or more specific traffic
criteria established by the State of California, Department of Transportation in the
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for the installation of all-way
stop control. Local jurisdictions may also adopt alternative criteria to incorporate
specific local conditions that are not reflected in the State's criteria. The Public Works
Department is considering potential criteria for residential streets in the City of El
Cerrito.

The State criteria indicates that all-way stop control can be installed where the number
of vehicles approaching the intersection from all directions is approximately equal for
                                                                  Agenda Item No. 5(E)

any eight hours of an average day or where there is a collision problem as indicated by
five or more reported crashes susceptible to correction by an all-way stop. Such crashes
include right- and left-turn collisions as well as right-angle collisions. The potential City
criteria include similar, but reduced thresholds for residential streets. Other criteria that
may be considered in an engineering study include the need to control left-turn conflicts;
the need to control vehicle/pedestrian conflicts near locations that generate high
pedestrian volume; locations where a road user, after stopping, cannot see conflicting
traffic and is not able to safely negotiate the intersection unless conflicting cross traffic
is also required to stop; and an intersection of two residential collector streets of similar
design and operating characteristics where all-way stop control would improve traffic
operational characteristics of the intersection.

Public Works engaged the services of TJKM Transportation Consultants to conduct
engineering studies based on the State criteria for the three intersections described below
because we have received many complaints regarding these intersections over the last
several years. Public Works Staff also reviewed the potential City criteria for
applicability under various conditions.

Barrett Avenue at Arlington Boulevard

The Public Works Department has received complaints concerning the limited visibility,
confusing traffic control and pedestrian safety at the intersection of Barrett Avenue at
Arlington Boulevard. The intersection is located in a residential neighborhood. Both
streets are classified as minor arterials in the El Cerrito General Plan. Both streets are
also designated as pedestrian and bicycle routes in the El Cerrito Circulation Plan for
Bicyclists and Pedestrians.

The T-intersection (intersection with three legs) of Barrett Avenue and Arlington
Boulevard has stop-sign control on the two legs of Arlington Boulevard. Barrett
Avenue, the terminating street, is uncontrolled. This is an unusual configuration
because at T-intersections without stop or yield signs, drivers on the terminating leg of
the intersection must yield to vehicles on the continuing street, which in this case would
be Arlington Boulevard.

TJKM determined that although the traffic volume and collision thresholds were not met
at this intersection, the State criteria based on visibility constraints and traffic
operational improvements were met. Staff determined that the volume thresholds of the
potential City criteria have also been met. Motorists traveling southbound on Arlington
Boulevard have difficulty seeing vehicles traveling on eastbound Barrett Avenue (even
after the limit line was moved southward several years ago) because Barrett Avenue
slopes up and curves as it approaches Arlington Boulevard. In addition, the unusual stop
control at the intersection leads to motorist and pedestrian confusion.

Arlington Boulevard is considered to be the major street at this intersection because it
carries higher traffic volumes than Barrett Avenue. Therefore, stopping the Barrett
Avenue approach along with Arlington Boulevard will improve traffic operations at this




                                           Page 2
                                                                  Agenda Item No. 5(E)

intersection. With the installation of an all-way stop, the intersection will operate at
better levels of service and vehicle queuing will be reduced.

Given these conditions, TJKM recommended establishment of an all-way stop at the
intersection of Barrett Avenue and Arlington Boulevard. The installation of an all-way
stop is expected to improve pedestrian safety and traffic operations at this intersection.
Based on these factors, Public Works Staff is proposing installation of a stop sign along
with associated warning signs and pavement markings on the eastbound approach of
Barrett Avenue to establish an all-way stop at the intersection. Crosswalks will also be
marked on all three legs of the intersection.

Stockton Avenue at Ashbury Avenue

The Public Works Department has also received complaints concerning the limited
visibility, confusing traffic control and pedestrian safety, at the five-leg intersection of
Stockton Avenue and Ashbury Avenue with its fifth leg being Albemarle Street. The
intersection is located in a mostly residential neighborhood with the Stockton Avenue
commercial area located just to the west of the intersection. Both streets are classified as
collectors in the El Cerrito General Plan and are also designated as pedestrian and
bicycle routes in the El Cerrito Circulation Plan for Bicyclists and Pedestrians. Ashbury
Avenue and Stockton Avenue serve as important links between various destinations in
the City including four schools (El Cerrito High School, Fairmount Elementary School,
Portola Middle School, and Prospect Sierra Middle School) and several community
destinations (Stockton Avenue commercial area, Community Center, Senior Center,
Library, Cerrito Vista Park, and Civic Theater), all located within a third of a mile of the
intersection.

The intersection of Stockton Avenue and Ashbury Avenue has stop-sign control on the
three legs of Ashbury Avenue and Albemarle Street and no traffic control on Stockton
Avenue. The intersection has five marked crosswalks on all legs including two on
Stockton Avenue that are uncontrolled. A marked crosswalk typically indicates a
preferred or often-used pedestrian crossing location based on various factors including
visibility, traffic control devices, traffic calming measures, walking routes to school, and
proximity of land uses generating a high-level of pedestrian activity. An uncontrolled
crosswalk is one that does not have a traffic signal or stop sign to control traffic
movements. It should be noted that a pedestrian has the right to cross at any intersection
within the prolongation lines of the adjacent sidewalk whether or not a crosswalk is
marked.

TJKM determined that although the traffic volume and collision thresholds were not met
at this intersection, the State criteria based on visibility constraints, high pedestrian
volumes, and traffic operational improvements were met. Staff determined that volume
threshold of the potential City criteria have also been met. All five legs of the
intersection cross at a skew and Stockton Avenue has a gradual slope. Due to this
roadway geometry, visibility is limited between traffic on Ashbury Avenue and traffic
on Stockton Avenue (even with trimming of vegetation in the area).




                                           Page 3

As previously indicated, there are four schools and various community destinations
located near this intersection. This results in a high level of pedestrian activity. During
a morning peak period between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM, over 180 pedestrians were
observed using the intersection with the majority of crossings occurring on the south leg
of Ashbury Avenue and the second highest occurring on the west leg of Stockton
Avenue.

Stockton Avenue and Ashbury Avenue have similar traffic operating characteristics and
carry relatively equal levels of traffic throughout the day. Therefore, stopping both
approaches of Stockton Avenue along with those on Ashbury Avenue and Albemarle
Street will improve traffic operations at this intersection. With the installation of an all-
way stop, the intersection will operate at better levels of service although vehicle
queuing will increase because Stockton Avenue carries higher traffic volumes than
Ashbury Avenue.

Given these conditions, TJKM recommended establishment of an all-way stop at the
intersection of Stockton Avenue and Ashbury Avenue. The installation of an all-way
stop is expected to improve pedestrian safety and traffic operations at this intersection.
Based on these factors, Public Works Staff is proposing installation of stop signs along
with associated warning signs and pavement markings on the Stockton Avenue
approaches to establish an all-way stop at the intersection.

Central Avenue at Ashbury Avenue

The Public Works Department has also received complaints concerning pedestrian
safety at the intersection of Central Avenue and Ashbury Avenue. The intersection is
generally located in a residential neighborhood and is bordered on the east by El Cerrito
High School. Ashbury Avenue is classified as a collector in the El Cerrito General Plan.
While this section of Central Avenue is classified as a local street, it functions as a
collector during certain times of day especially given its direct route to El Cerrito High
School. Both streets are also designated as pedestrian routes in the El Cerrito
Circulation Plan for Bicyclists and Pedestrians. As previously mentioned, Ashbury
Avenue serves as an important link between various key destinations in the City. In this
area, it is located near El Cerrito High School and Harding Elementary School.

The T-intersection of Central Avenue and Ashbury Avenue has stop-sign control on
Central Avenue and no traffic control on Ashbury Avenue. The intersection has three
marked crosswalks on all legs including two on Ashbury Avenue that are uncontrolled.
All are considered school crosswalks and marked in yellow because they are located
within 500 feet of a school.

TJKM determined that although the traffic volume and collision thresholds were not met
at this intersection, the State criteria based on high pedestrian volumes and traffic
operational improvements were met. Staff determined that volume threshold of the
potential City criteria have also been met. This intersection is also located in an area
with a high level of pedestrian activity. During an afternoon peak period between 3:00
PM and 6:00 PM, close to 150 pedestrians were observed using the intersection with the


                                           Page 4
                                                                  Agenda Item No. 5(E)

majority of crossings occurring on the north leg of Ashbury Avenue and the second
highest occurring on the south leg.

Central Avenue and Ashbury Avenue have similar traffic operating characteristics and
carry equal levels of traffic throughout the day. Therefore, stopping both approaches of
Ashbury Avenue along with Central Avenue will improve traffic operations at this
intersection. With the installation of an all-way stop, the intersection will operate at
better levels of service and vehicle queuing will generally stay about the same.

Given these conditions, TJKM recommended establishment of an all-way stop at the
intersection of Central Avenue and Ashbury Avenue. The installation of an all-way stop
is expected to improve pedestrian safety and traffic operations at this intersection.
Based on these factors, Public Works Staff is proposing installation of stop signs along
with associated pavement markings on the Ashbury Avenue approaches to establish an
all-way stop at the intersection.

The TJKM engineering studies for all three intersections are attached.

Stop Sign Installation on Curry Avenue at Pomona Avenue

The Public Works Department has received requests from residents concerned about
safety at the intersection of Curry Avenue and Pomona Avenue. Public Works staff
evaluated the existing traffic control devices, including signs, striping, and pavement
markings at this T-intersection. The intersection has no traffic control signs on any of its
legs. In the past, the City has not typically used stop signs at T-intersections in
residential areas. This is because at T-intersections without stop or yield signs, the right-
of-way rules are covered under the California Vehicle Code (Section 21800), which
requires that drivers on the terminating leg of the intersection yield to vehicles on the
continuing street. However, the California MUTCD indicates that stop signs should be
used if engineering judgment indicates that one or more of several conditions exist:

       Intersection of a less important road with a main road where application of the
       normal right-of-way rule would not be expected to provide reasonable
       compliance with the law;
       Street entering a through highway or street;
       Unsignalized intersection in a signalized area; and/or
       High speeds, restricted view, or crash records indicate a need for control by the
       STOP sign.
Both Curry Avenue and Pomona Avenue are local residential streets. Curry Avenue, the
terminating street, is wider than Pomona Avenue. The condition is atypical and can lead
to unexpected speeds of vehicles as they approach the continuing street. Curry Avenue
is currently controlled by stop signs at all other intersecting roadways east of Pomona
Avenue including Ramona, Carmel, San Carlos, and Santa Fe Avenues. Parked vehicles
can also limit visibility between Curry Avenue and Pomona Avenue.

Based on the existing roadway configuration and surrounding traffic control devices at
the subject intersection, Public Works Staff is proposing installation of a stop sign and
associated pavement markings on Curry Avenue at Pomona Avenue to improve traffic
safety and operations.

Green Curb Marking in front of 10422 San Pablo Avenue

The Public Works Department is proposing to install 40 feet of green curb marking on
the east side of San Pablo Avenue in front of 10422 San Pablo Avenue, where Bank of
America is located. This is in response to requests from adjacent businesses located at
10408 San Pablo Avenue, immediately south of Bank of America and north of Stockton
Avenue, for on-street parking to better serve their needs.

Currently, the curb space immediately in front of the businesses at 10408 San Pablo
Avenue is marked red for a bus stop while the 40 feet of on-street parking in front of
Bank of America has a one (1)-hour time limit between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM, except
Sundays and holidays. To better serve the customers of the businesses in this area,
shorter-term parking is also needed. The proposed installation of green curb marking
would limit parking to fifteen (15) minutes at any time between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM
of any day except holidays. A white curb marking is not appropriate because vehicles
will be left unattended.

In August 2013, an initial notification regarding the proposed green curb marking was
sent to property owners and businesses within a 300-foot radius of this location. No
comments were received. Earlier this September, a final notification regarding these
modifications was sent to the requestor and the immediately adjacent addresses
including Bank of America.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The cost for installation of signs, pavement markings, and curb markings are estimated
to be under $4,000 and are included in the Public Works, Maintenance operating budget.

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS
El Cerrito Municipal Code Section 11.36.010 requires that the installation of stop signs
be approved by City Council Resolution.

El Cerrito Municipal Code Section 11.40.160 requires that any modification of green
curb markings be approved by City Council Resolution.

D. Where no single criterion is satisfied, but where Criteria B, C.1, and C.2 are all satisfied to 80 percent
    of the minimum values. Criterion C.3 is excluded from this condition.
Option:
         Other criteria that may be considered in an engineering study include:
         1. The need to control left-turn conflicts;
         2. The need to control vehicle/pedestrian conflicts near locations that generate high pedestrian
             volumes;
         3. Locations where a road user, after stopping, cannot see conflicting traffic and is not able to
             safely negotiate the intersection unless conflicting cross traffic is also required to stop; and
         4. An intersection of two residential neighborhood collector (through) street of similar design and
             operating characteristics where multiway stop control would improve traffic operational
             characteristics of the intersection.

TJKM conducted All-Way Stop analysis for the intersection based on the MUTCD criteria. This
included collision analysis based on a review of the most current 5-year SWITRS collision database
(2005 to 2009). The details are contained in Appendix B.

Existing Condition
Both Barrett Avenue and Arlington Boulevard are classified as minor arterial streets. Also, both
are designated as Pedestrian Routes in the City's Circulation Plan. Currently stop control is
located on Arlington Boulevard. Barrett
Avenue tees into Arlington Boulevard and is
not stop controlled.

The average daily traffic (ADT) on Arlington
Boulevard and Barrett Avenue are
approximately 2,900 vehicles per day (vpd)
and 1,100 vpd respectively. Pedestrian and
bicycle volumes are quite low ­ with the
highest peak hour volume of four pedestrians
and one bike during the a.m. peak hour and
eight pedestrians and one bike during the
p.m. peak hour.


Results of Analysis
The following is a summary of the minimum
criteria as indicated in the MUTCD:
Minimum volumes (8-hour) ­ not met for both major and minor streets. Volume criteria met for
five of eight hours on the major street and met five hours on the minor street.
Collision Criteria (five or more reported crashes in a 12-month period that are susceptible to correction) -
A total of three accidents were reported in a 12-month period.

Note the MUTCD warrants also include the other criteria that may be considered in an
engineering study include in Criteria D-3 that states:
" Locations where a road user, after stopping, cannot see conflicting traffic and is not able to safely
negotiate the intersection unless conflicting cross traffic is also required to stop;..."
Sight distance at northwest corner has been reported to be a problem even after the limit line was
moved southward on Arlington Boulevard. It is our understanding that many residents have
complained regarding the confusing traffic control at this intersection given that normally the stem
of a T-intersection, in this case Barrett Avenue, would be required to Yield/Stop.

Although these streets are both arterial streets, they function like residential collectors. Due to
sight visibility constraints and associated issues, an all-way stop control intersection is justified
based on MUTCD Other D-3Criteria. The detailed information and summary of the all-way stop
analysis are contained in Appendix B.

Level of Service LOS Analysis
The existing peak hour data were analyzed using the Synchro software and the level of service
(LOS) along with queuing analysis were performed for the existing conditions and the proposed
All-Way Stop control. The queuing analysis performed is based on the results of Simtraffic micro-
simulation at 95th percentile queuing. The results of the analysis are shown in Table I.

Note: queuing is based on the worst approach queue.

The existing intersection operates at LOS C during the a.m. peak hour as shown in Table I. If
converted to All-Way Stop control, the intersection will operate at LOS A during the a.m. and
p.m. peak hour. With All-Way Stop control, the estimated maximum queue would be reduced
from the estimated existing queue of 93 feet to approximately 79 feet during the a.m. peak hour
(approximately 15 percent decrease). Therefore, based on the MUTCD Other D-4Criteria, a
conversion to multiway stop control would improve traffic operational characteristics of the
intersection.


Conclusion: All Way Stop justified based on MUTCD Other D-3and D-4 Criteria.

                     - All Way Stop Warrants Analysis
                     - Collision Analysis based on SWITRS Data (2005 ­ 2009)
Table I: Barrett Ave and Arlington Blvd Multi-way Stop Warrant Analysis
CA MUTCD Multiway Stop Installation Guidance                           Comment                    Warrant Met?

  A. Where traffic control signals are justified, the
  multiway stop is an interim measure that can be
  installed quickly to control traffic while              Based on the hourly volume from
  arrangements are being made for the installation of ADT counts at this intersection, signal
  the traffic control signal.                             warrants were not met.                      No

  B. A crash problem, as indicated by 5 or more
  reported crashes in a 12-month period that are
  susceptible to correction by a multiway stop
  installation. Such crashes include right- and left-     A maximum of three accidents were
  turn collisions as well as right-angle collisions.      reported in a 12-month period.              No
  C. Minimum Volumes:

      1. The vehicular volume entering the
      intersection from the major street approaches
      (total of both approaches) averages at least 300
      vehicles per hour for any 8 hours of an average Five peak hours exceed 300 vph based
      day, and                                            on ADT counts                               No

      2. The combined vehicular, pedestrian, and
      bicycle volume entering the intersection from
      the minor street approaches (total of both
      approaches) averages at least 200 units per
      hour for the same 8 hours, with an average          None of the hourly counts exceeded
      delay to minor-street vehicular traffic of at       200 vehicles on the minor street. The
      least 30 seconds per vehicle during the highest highest peak hour volume is
      hour, but                                           approximately 164 vehicles.                 No
      3. If the 85th-percentile approach speed of
      the major-street traffic exceeds 65 km/h or
      exceeds 40 mph, the minimum vehicular
      volume warrants are 70 percent of the above         The the 85th-percentile of Arlington
      values.                                             Ave is 31 mph.                              No

  D. Where no single criterion is satisfied, but
  where Criteria B, C.1, and C.2 are all satisfied to     None of the criteria B, C.1, and C.2
  80 percent of the minimum values. Criterion C.3 is are satisfied to 80 percent of the
  excluded from this condition.                           minimum values.                             No

D. Where no single criterion is satisfied, but where Criteria B, C.1, and C.2 are all satisfied to 80 percent
    of the minimum values. Criterion C.3 is excluded from this condition.
Option:
         Other criteria that may be considered in an engineering study include:
         1. The need to control left-turn conflicts;
         2. The need to control vehicle/pedestrian conflicts near locations that generate high pedestrian
             volumes;
         3. Locations where a road user, after stopping, cannot see conflicting traffic and is not able to
             safely negotiate the intersection unless conflicting cross traffic is also required to stop; and
         4. An intersection of two residential neighborhood collector (through) street of similar design and
             operating characteristics where multiway stop control would improve traffic operational
             characteristics of the intersection.

TJKM conducted All-Way Stop analysis for the intersection based on the MUTCD criteria. This
included collision analysis based on a review of the most current 5-year SWITRS collision database
(2005 to 2009). The details are contained in Appendix B.

Existing Condition
The intersection of Ashbury Avenue and Stockton Avenue is a five legged intersection with the
fifth leg being Albermarle Street. Stockton
Avenue is uncontrolled and the other three
approaches on Ashbury Avenue and
Albemarle Street are stop controlled. The
intersection is generally level and visibility is
clear.

Ashbury Avenue and Stockton Avenue are
both classified as collector streets, and
Albemarle Street is a local street. Also, both
Ashbury Avenue and Stockton Avenue are
designated as Pedestrian Routes in the City's
Circulation Plan. All three streets are two
lane roadways. The estimated ADT of
Ashbury Avenue and Stockton Avenue are
respectively 4,500 vpd and 5,500 vpd. The
highest amount of pedestrians and bicycle
traffic that totals 84 occurs during the a.m.
peak hour on the south leg of Ashbury
Avenue. This is likely school related traffic
since there are four schools located nearby -
Prospect Sierra Middle School, El Cerrito High School, Fairmount Elementary School and Portola
Middle School. Pedestrian and bicycle traffic on the uncontrolled east and wet leg are smaller at
less than 10 during the a.m. peak hour.

Results of Analysis
The following is a summary of the minimum criteria as indicated in the MUTCD:
Minimum volumes (8-hour) ­ not met for both major and minor streets. Volume criteria met for
five of 8 hours on the major street and met six hours on the minor street.
Collision Criteria (5 or more reported crashes in a 12-month period that are susceptible to correction) - A
total of three accidents were reported in a 12-month period. The detailed information and
summary of the all-way stop analysis are contained in Appendix B.

Note the MUTCD warrants also include the other criteria that may be considered in an
engineering study include in Criteria D-3 that states:
" Locations where a road user, after stopping, cannot see conflicting traffic and is not able to safely
negotiate the intersection unless conflicting cross traffic is also required to stop;..." It is our
understanding that due to the skew of the intersection, sight distance at southeast corner has been
reported to be a problem even with removal of vegetation.

Also, Criteria D-2 that states: "The need to control vehicle/pedestrian conflicts near locations that
generate high pedestrian volumes; ..." Note that there are four schools located within a third of a
mile from the intersection. In addition, the Community Center, Senior Center, Library, Cerrito
Vista Park and Civic Theater are also within walking distance. The presence of these land uses
generates high pedestrian traffic that needs to be served safely.

In conclusion, due to sight visibility constraints and amount of school age pedestrians in the vicinity
and associated issues, an all-way stop control intersection is justified based on MUTCD Other D-2
and D-3Criteria. The detailed information and summary of the all-way stop analysis are contained
in Appendix B.

Level of Service LOS Analysis
The existing peak hour data were analyzed using the Synchro software and the level of service
(LOS) along with queuing analysis were performed for the existing conditions and the proposed
All-Way Stop control. The queuing analysis performed is based on the results of Simtraffic micro-
simulation at 95th percentile queuing. The results of the analysis are shown in Table I.

Note: queuing is based on the worst approach queue.

The existing intersection will operate at LOS D during the a.m. peak hour as shown in Table I. If
converted to All-Way Stop control, the intersection will operate at LOS B during the a.m. and
p.m. peak hour. With All-Way Stop control, the estimated maximum queue could be increased
from the estimated existing queue of 139 feet to approximately 260 feet during the a.m. peak
hour. Therefore, based on the MUTCD Other D-4Criteria, a conversion to multiway stop
control would improve the LOS at the intersection.

Conclusion: All Way Stop justified based on MUTCD Other D-2and D-3 Criteria.

                     - All Way Stop Warrants Analysis
                     - Collision Analysis based on SWITRS Data (2005 ­ 2009)
Table III: Ashbury Ave and Stockton Ave Multi-way Stop Warrant Analysis
CA MUTCD Multiway Stop Installation Guidance                             Comment                      Warrant Met?

  A. Where traffic control signals are justified, the
  multiway stop is an interim measure that can be
  installed quickly to control traffic while             Based on the hourly volume from ADT
  arrangements are being made for the installation of counts at this intersection, signal warrants
  the traffic control signal.                            were not met.                                    No
  B. A crash problem, as indicated by 5 or more
  reported crashes in a 12-month period that are
  susceptible to correction by a multiway stop
  installation. Such crashes include right- and left-    A maximum of three accidents were
  turn collisions as well as right-angle collisions.     reported in a 12-month period.                   No
  C. Minimum Volumes:
      1. The vehicular volume entering the
      intersection from the major street approaches
      (total of both approaches) averages at least 300
      vehicles per hour for any 8 hours of an average Five peak hour volumes exceed 300 vph
      day, and                                           based on ADT counts                              No

      2. The combined vehicular, pedestrian, and
      bicycle volume entering the intersection from
      the minor street approaches (total of both
      approaches) averages at least 200 units per
      hour for the same 8 hours, with an average         Six hourly counts exceeded 200 vehicles
      delay to minor-street vehicular traffic of at      on the minor street. The highest peak
      least 30 seconds per vehicle during the highest hour volume is approximately 385
      hour, but                                          vehicles.                                        No

      3. If the 85th-percentile approach speed of
      the major-street traffic exceeds 65 km/h or
      exceeds 40 mph, the minimum vehicular
      volume warrants are 70 percent of the above        The the 85th-percentile of Stockton Ave is
      values.                                            28 mph.                                          No

  D. Where no single criterion is satisfied, but
  where Criteria B, C.1, and C.2 are all satisfied to    None of the criteria B, C.1, and C.2 are
  80 percent of the minimum values. Criterion C.3 is satisfied to 80 percent of the minimum
  excluded from this condition.                          values.                                          No

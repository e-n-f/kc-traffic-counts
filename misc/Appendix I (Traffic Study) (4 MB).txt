1.0        INTRODUCTION
This traffic analysis has been prepared to identify and evaluate the potential traffic impacts of the
proposed East Walnut Street Mixed-Used project. The proposed development project is located at
1727, 1757 and 1787 East Walnut Street in the City of Pasadena, California. The project site is
situated along the north side of Walnut Street between just west of Meridith Avenue and Allen
Avenue within the Gold Line sub-area of the East Colorado Boulevard Specific Plan. The project
site is bounded by existing commercial development to the north, Walnut Street to the south, Allen
Avenue to the east, and existing commercial development to the west. Additionally, the project site
is located approximately one block south of the Metro Gold Line Allen Avenue station. The
proposed project site location and general vicinity are shown in Figure 1­1.

The traffic analysis follows City of Pasadena traffic study guidelines 1 and is consistent with traffic
impact assessment guidelines set forth in the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los
Angeles County 2. This traffic analysis evaluates potential project-related impacts at seven key
intersections in the vicinity of the project site. The study intersections were determined in
consultation with City of Pasadena Department of Transportation staff. The Intersection Capacity
Utilization method was used to determine Volume-to-Capacity ratios and corresponding Levels of
Service at the study intersections. Four street segments in the project vicinity also were evaluated
for project-related impacts based on criteria set forth in the City's traffic study guidelines. A review
was conducted of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority intersection and
freeway monitoring stations to determine if a Congestion Management Program transportation
impact assessment analysis is required for the proposed project. In addition, a review of existing
pedestrian conditions and potential measures for consideration to improve pedestrian connections
and enhance pedestrian safety near the project site is included herein.

This study (i) presents existing traffic volumes, forecasts existing traffic volumes with the proposed
project traffic volumes (ii) forecasts future traffic volumes with ambient growth and the related
projects, (iii) forecasts future traffic volumes with the proposed project traffic volumes, (iv)
determines project-related impacts, and (v) recommends mitigation measures, where necessary.

1.1        Study Area
Based on direction from City of Pasadena staff, a total of 11 locations, including seven study
intersections and four street segments, have been identified for evaluation. These study locations
provide local access to the study area and define the extent of the boundaries for this traffic impact
investigation. Further discussion of the existing street system and study area is provided in Section
4.0 herein.

The general location of the project in relation to the study locations and surrounding street system is
presented in Figure 1­1. The traffic analysis study area is generally comprised of those locations
which have the greatest potential to experience significant traffic impacts due to the proposed project
as defined by the Lead Agency. In the traffic engineering practice, the study area generally includes
those intersections that are:

           a.         Immediately adjacent or in close proximity to the project site;

           b.         In the vicinity of the project site that are documented to have current or projected
                      future adverse operational issues; and

           c.         In the vicinity of the project site that are forecast to experience a relatively greater
                      percentage of project-related vehicular turning movements (e.g., at freeway ramp
                      intersections).

The locations selected for analysis were based on the above criteria, the proposed East Walnut Street
Mixed-Use project peak hour vehicle trip generation, the anticipated distribution of project vehicular
trips and existing intersection/corridor operations.

2.0        PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1        Site Location
The proposed development project is located at 1727, 1757 and 1787 East Walnut Street in the City
of Pasadena, California. The project site is situated along the north side of Walnut Street between
just west of Meridith Avenue and Allen Avenue within the Gold Line sub-area of the East Colorado
Boulevard Specific Plan. The project site is bounded by existing commercial development to the
north, Walnut Street to the south, Allen Avenue to the east, and existing commercial development to
the west. Additionally, the project site is located approximately one block south of the Metro Gold
Line Allen Avenue station. The proposed project site location and general vicinity are shown in
Figure 1­1.

The project site is located along the Walnut Street and Allen Avenue corridors, which are designated
by the City as multi-modal corridors, as well as within close proximity to several other multi-modal
corridors such as Hill Avenue, Colorado Boulevard, Union Street, Green Street, and Del Mar
Boulevard. As stated in the 2004 Mobility Element of the City of Pasadena General Plan
(November 8, 2004), multi-modal corridors are being developed to promote the efficient and
convenient travel by all appropriate modes (e.g., pedestrian, bicycle, regional and local bus transit,
light rail, vehicular, etc.). The City's intent is to "create an environment where different modes of
travel can co-exist and share the roadway, providing seamless connections and reinforcing each
other to develop a balanced and efficient transportation system." 3

The East Walnut Street Mixed-Use project is located within the Gold Line sub-area of the East
Colorado Boulevard Specific Plan. The project site is well-located to facilitate pedestrian activity
and usage of public transit services, particularly by nearby Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (Metro) and Pasadena Area Rapid Transit Service bus routes. The Metro Gold Line Allen
Avenue station is located just one block north of the project site. Finally, the proposed project is
situated within close proximity to the retail, restaurant, and other commercial businesses located
along the Hill Avenue, Allen Avenue, Walnut Street, and Colorado Boulevard corridors, as well as
Pasadena City College.

2.2        Existing Project Site
The existing project site comprises approximately 1.9 acres and is currently occupied by three vacant
buildings and an existing automobile service building all of which total roughly 14,750 square feet
of floor area and 40 surface parking spaces. The portion of project site along the north side of
Walnut Street between Meridith Avenue and Allen Avenue was formerly utilized by the now defunct
Davis Lumber company, while the existing automobile service land use is situated at the northwest
corner of the Meridith Avenue/Walnut Street intersection and includes a building with a total of
roughly 2,735 square feet of floor area. The existing buildings will be removed to accommodate
development of the proposed project.

2.3        Project Description
The project applicant seeks to obtain entitlements to construct a mixed-use project with apartment
and retail land uses. A total of 128 apartment dwelling units and 5,000 square feet of neighborhood
serving retail space is planned to be provided as part of the proposed project. As part of the
proposed project, Meridith Avenue north of Walnut Street will be vacated and incorporated into the
project site. Meridith Avenue presently terminates approximately 125 feet north of Walnut Street.
With the street vacation, access to the project site will be accommodated via a single site driveway
located in essentially the same location as the north leg of Meridith Avenue (i.e., the site driveway
will form the north leg of the Meridith Avenue/Walnut Street intersection). Construction of the
proposed project is expected to commence in year 2014 with occupancy in the year 2015. The site
plan for the proposed project is illustrated in Figure 2-1.

Vehicular access to the existing site was previously provided via a total of four driveways including
one driveway on Allen Avenue, two driveways on Walnut Street and one driveway on Meridith
Avenue. As noted above, vehicular access to the proposed project will be provided via the north leg
of the Meridith Avenue/Walnut Street intersection following street vacation of the north leg of
Meridith Avenue. It is also important to note that all of the existing site driveways on Hill Avenue
will be closed as part of the proposed project. In addition, a total of 222 parking spaces are planned
to be provided as part of the proposed project in a subterranean and at-grade parking garage. Further
discussion of the project's site access and circulation scheme are provided in Section 3.0 herein.

3.0        SITE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION
Descriptions of the proposed project site access and circulation scheme are provided in the following
subsections.

3.1        Existing Site Access
All existing site driveways will be closed pursuant to City standards with concrete curb, gutter and
sidewalk. This includes the closure of four driveways including one driveway on Allen Avenue, two
driveways on Walnut Street and one driveway on Meridith Avenue. Also, the project applicant will
repair any existing or newly damaged curb, gutter and sidewalk without cutting any pavement along
the Allen Avenue and Walnut Street property frontages.

3.2        Proposed Project Site Access
The proposed site access scheme for the East Walnut Street Mixed-Use project is displayed in
Figure 2-1. As part of the proposed project, Meridith Avenue north of Walnut Street will be vacated
and incorporated into the project site. Meridith Avenue presently terminates approximately 125 feet
north of Walnut Street. With the street vacation, access to the project site will be accommodated via
a single site driveway located in essentially the same location as the north leg of Meridith Avenue
(i.e., the site driveway will form the north leg of the Meridith Avenue/Walnut Street intersection).
The project site driveway will provide access to the at-grade parking spaces and the subterranean
parking garage and accommodate full access (i.e., left-turn and right-turn ingress and egress turning
movements). The project site driveway will be constructed to City of Pasadena design standards.

3.3        Pedestrian Access
As previously noted, the East Walnut Street Mixed-Use project is located within the College District
sub-area of the East Colorado Boulevard Specific Plan. The Hill Avenue/Colorado Boulevard
intersection is one of the locations within the sub-area that the Specific Plan indicates should be
beautified by an enhanced pedestrian-oriented streetscape.4 Based on the existing high level of
pedestrian activity in the area due to Pasadena City College, it is anticipated that significant
pedestrian patronage of the proposed project will occur as a result of the proximity to the college.

It is recommended that the project be designed to encourage pedestrian activity and walking as a
transportation mode 4. As indicated in Figure 2­1, the proposed project will connect to adjacent
sidewalks but site enhancements should be implemented to promote walkability. Walkability is a
term for the extent to which walking is readily available as a safe, connected, accessible and pleasant
mode of transport. There are several criteria that are widely accepted as key aspects of the
walkability of urban areas that should be satisfied. The underlying principle is that pedestrians

  For example, refer to http://www.walkscore.com/, which generates a walkability score of approximately 866 (Very
Walkable) out of 100 for the project site. Walk Score calculates the walkability of an address by locating nearby stores,
restaurants, schools, parks, etc. Walk Score measures how easy it is to live a car-lite lifestyle--not how pretty the area is
for walking.

                                                                                              East Walnut Street Mixed-Use Project
                                                                                                   O:\JOB_FILE\4011\Report\4011-Rpt2.doc

should not be delayed, diverted, or placed in danger.            The widely accepted characteristics of
walkability are as follows:

      ·    Connectivity: People can walk from one place to another without encountering major
           obstacles, obstructions, or loss of connectivity.

      ·    Convivial: Pedestrian routes are friendly and attractive, and are perceived as such by
           pedestrians.

      ·    Conspicuous: Suitable levels of lighting, visibility and surveillance over its entire length,
           with high quality delineation and signage.

      ·    Comfortable: High quality and well-maintained footpaths of suitable widths, attractive
           landscaping and architecture, shelter and rest spaces, and a suitable allocation of roadspace to
           pedestrians.

      ·    Convenient: Walking is a realistic travel choice, partly because of the impact of the other
           criteria set forth above, but also because walking routes are of a suitable length as a result of
           land use planning with minimal delays.

The project is situated within the College District sub-area of the East Colorado Specific Plan and
accessible to the retail, restaurant, and other commercial businesses located along the Hill Avenue,
Walnut Street, Colorado Boulevard and Green Street corridors. The site's pedestrian walkways and
adjacent sidewalks should be appropriately landscaped and adorned to provide a friendly walking
environment. Further review of existing pedestrian conditions adjacent to the project site and
recommended improvement measures are provided in the following subsection.

3.4        Bicycle Access
Bicycle access to the project site will be facilitated by the City of Pasadena bicycle roadway
network. A total of eight bicycle routes (i.e., Class II Bike Lanes, Class III Bike Routes or Enhanced
Class III Bike Routes) in the City's bicycle network are located within an approximate one-mile
radius from the project site. The following key bicycle routes are located near the East Walnut
Street Mixed-Use project site:

Class II bikeways are lanes on the outside edge of roadways reserved for the exclusive use of
bicycles and are designated with special signing and pavement markings. Class III bikeways are
roadways recommended for bicycle use and are designated with signs posted along roadways.
Enhanced Class III bikeways include 4" white edgelines and "Share the Road" signage.

Use of bicycles as a transportation mode to and from the project site will be encouraged by the
provision of ample and safe parking. As identified in the City Code (refer to Table 4-16, Minimum
Number of Bicycle Spaces Required, in Section 17.46.320), the required number of bicycle parking
spaces multi-family residential structures is one (1) space for every six dwelling units. Based on this
requirement, a minimum total of 21 bicycle parking spaces (128 ÷ 6 = 21 spaces) are required on-site
for the residential component of the proposed project. Convenient bicycle parking spaces also are
recommended for patrons of the neighborhood serving retail space included in the proposed project.
As also identified in the City Code (refer to Table 4-16, Minimum Number of Bicycle Spaces
Required, in Section 17.46.320), a minimum of four (4) on-site bicycle parking spaces will be
required for the retail component of the proposed project (all nonresidential structures less that
15,000 square feet).

·     Freeways are limited-access and high speed travel ways included in the state and federal
      highway systems. Their purpose is to carry regional through-traffic. Access is provided by
      interchanges with typical spacing of one mile or greater. No local access is provided to adjacent
      land uses.

·     Arterial roadways are major streets that primarily serve through-traffic and provide access to
      abutting properties as a secondary function. Arterials are generally designed with two to six
      travel lanes and their major intersections are signalized. This roadway type is divided into two
      categories: principal and minor arterials. Principal arterials are typically four-or-more lane
      roadways and serve both local and regional through-traffic. Minor arterials are typically two-to-
      four lane streets that service local and commute traffic.

·     Collector roadways are streets that provide access and traffic circulation within residential and
      non-residential (e.g., commercial and industrial) areas. Collector roadways connect local streets
      to arterials and are typically designed with two through travel lanes (i.e., one through travel lane
      in each direction) that may accommodate on-street parking. They may also provide access to
      abutting properties.

·     Local roadways distribute traffic within a neighborhood, or similar adjacent neighborhoods, and
      are not intended for use as a through-street or a link between higher capacity facilities such as
      collector or arterial roadways. Local streets are fronted by residential uses and do not typically
      serve commercial uses.

4.4        Roadway Descriptions
A brief description of the important roadways in the project site vicinity is provided in the following
paragraphs.

Hill Avenue is a north-south oriented roadway that is located west of the project site. Hill Avenue is
classified as a Minor Arterial in the City's General Plan Mobility Element (November 2004). Two

4.6        Light Rail Transit Services
The Metro Gold Line is a light rail transit line that runs east-west from East Pasadena to the
Pasadena Civic Center area and north-south from the Pasadena Civic Center area to Union Station in
Downtown Los Angeles. The Gold Line travels within the median of the Foothill (I-210) Freeway
and in Metro right-of-way between Raymond Avenue and Arroyo Parkway. The Gold Line Light
Rail system provides six stations in the City of Pasadena: 1) Sierra Madre Villa station, 2) Allen
Avenue station, 3) Lake Avenue station, 4) Memorial Park station, 5) Del Mar station, and 6)
Fillmore Street station. The Allen Avenue station is located less than two blocks from the project
site. The stations serve as transportation hubs that connect travelers to local and regional transit
services provided by Pasadena ARTS, Foothill Transit, Metro, and others.

Construction is underway for the Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension project. 5 The Foothill
Extension currently is planned to traverse 24-miles through 11 cities located east of Pasadena. Each
of the 11 cities along the corridor has station sites under study. Each light rail car can carry 215
people (sitting and standing). The Metro Gold Line will be able to accommodate three-car trains. It
is projected that trains will stop at stations every 10 minutes during rush hour and every 20 minutes
during off-peak hours. Metro will integrate the Foothill Extension into existing Metro Rail service
and oversee operation of the line once construction is complete. A trip from Montclair to Downtown
Pasadena would take a little over 40 minutes; to Los Angeles would take approximately 75 minutes.
The Gold Line Foothill Extension will connect historic downtowns revitalizing the established
communities along the corridor; four historic depots are slated for renovation and incorporation into
future stations. The Foothill Extension has received the backing of all 11 corridor cities issuing City
Council resolutions of support.

5.0        TRAFFIC COUNTS
5.1        Manual Intersection Traffic Counts
New manual counts of vehicular turning movements were conducted at each of the seven study
intersections during the weekday morning (AM) and afternoon (PM) commuter periods to determine
the peak hour traffic volumes. The manual counts were conducted by a traffic count subconsultant,
City Traffic Counters, at the seven study intersections from 7:00 to 9:00 AM to determine the AM
peak commuter hour, and from 4:00 to 6:00 PM to determine the PM peak commuter hour. In
conjunction with the manual turning movement vehicle counts, a count of bicycle and pedestrian
volumes were collected during the peak periods. The traffic counts were conducted when local
schools and Pasadena City College were in session. Traffic volumes at the study intersections show
the morning and afternoon peak periods typically associated with peak commuter hours in the
metropolitan area.

The existing weekday AM and PM peak commuter period manual counts of turning vehicles at the
study intersections are summarized in Table 5-1. The existing traffic volumes at the study
intersections during the weekday AM and PM peak commuter hours are shown in Figures 5-1 and
5-2, respectively. Summary data worksheets of the manual traffic counts of the study intersections
are contained in Appendix A.

5.2        Automatic 24-Hour Machine Traffic Counts
Automatic 24-hour machine traffic counts of the four study street segments were conducted by a
traffic subconsultant, City Traffic Counters. The automatic 24-hour machine traffic counts were
conducted when local schools and Pasadena City College were in session. The existing 24-hour
average daily traffic (ADT) volumes at the study street segments are presented in Figure 5-3.
Copies of the 24-hour machine traffic counts for the study street segment locations also are
contained in Appendix A.

Section 15130 of the CEQA Guidelines. Specifically, the CEQA Guidelines provides two options
for developing the future traffic volume forecast:

           "(A) A list of past, present, and probable future projects producing related or
           cumulative impacts, including, if necessary, those projects outside the control of the
           [lead] agency, or

           (B) A summary of projections contained in an adopted local, regional or statewide
           plan, or related planning document, that describes or evaluates conditions
           contributing to the cumulative effect. Such plans may include: a general plan,
           regional transportation plan, or plans for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
           A summary of projections may also be contained in an adopted or certified prior
           environmental document for such a plan. Such projections may be supplemented
           with additional information such as a regional modeling program. Any such
           document shall be referenced and made available to the public at a location specified
           by the lead agency."

Accordingly, the traffic analysis provides a highly conservative estimate of future pre-project traffic
volumes as it incorporates both the "A" and "B" options outlined in CEQA Guidelines for purposes
of developing the forecast.

6.1        Cumulative Growth
A forecast of on-street traffic conditions prior to occupancy of the proposed project was prepared by
incorporating the potential trips associated with other known development projects (related projects)
in the area. With this information, the potential impact of the proposed project can be evaluated
within the context of the cumulative impact of all ongoing development. The list of related projects
was based on information on file at the City of Pasadena Departments of Planning and
Transportation, as well as recently accepted traffic impact analysis reports prepared for projects in
the vicinity of the proposed East Walnut Street Mixed-Use project site. The list of related projects in
the project site area is presented in Table 6-1. The location of the related projects is shown in Figure
6-1. The list of related projects was submitted to City of Pasadena Department of Transportation
staff for review and acceptance.

Traffic volumes expected to be generated by the related projects were calculated using rates
provided in the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation manual 6. The related
projects respective traffic generation for the AM and PM peak hours, as well as on a daily basis for a
typical weekday, is summarized in Table 6-1. The anticipated distribution of the related projects

traffic volumes to the study intersections during the weekday AM and PM peak hours is displayed in
Figures 6-2 and 6-3, respectively.

6.2        Ambient Traffic Growth
In order to account for area-wide regional growth not included in this analysis, the existing traffic
volumes were increased at an annual rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) to the year 2015 (i.e.,
the anticipated year of project build-out). The ambient growth factor was based on general traffic
growth factors provided in the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County (the
"CMP manual") and determined in consultation with PasDOT staff. It is noted that based on review
of the general traffic growth factors provided in the CMP manual for the San Gabriel Valley area, it
is anticipated that the existing traffic volumes are expected to increase at an annual rate of less than
1.0% per year between the years 2010 and 2015. Thus, application of this annual growth factor
allows for a conservative, worst case forecast of future traffic volumes in the area. Further, it is
noted that the CMP manual's traffic growth rate is intended to anticipate future traffic generated by
development projects in the project vicinity. Thus, the inclusion in this traffic analysis of both a
forecast of traffic generated by known related projects plus the use of an ambient growth traffic
factor based on CMP traffic model data results in a conservative estimate of future traffic volumes at
the study intersections.

7.0        TRAFFIC FORECASTING METHODOLOGY
In order to estimate the traffic impact characteristics of the East Walnut Street Mixed-Use project, a
multi-step process has been utilized. The first step is trip generation, which estimates the total
arriving and departing traffic volumes on a peak hour and daily basis. The traffic generation
potential is forecast by applying the appropriate vehicle trip generation equations or rates to the
project development tabulation.

The second step of the forecasting process is trip distribution, which identifies the origins and
destinations of inbound and outbound project traffic volumes. These origins and destinations are
typically based on demographics and existing/anticipated travel patterns in the study area.

The third step is traffic assignment, which involves the allocation of project traffic to study area
streets and intersections. Traffic assignment is typically based on minimization of travel time, which
may or may not involve the shortest route, depending on prevailing operating conditions and travel
speeds. Traffic distribution patterns are indicated by general percentage orientation, while traffic
assignment allocates specific volume forecasts to individual roadway links and intersection turning
movements throughout the study area.

With the forecasting process complete and project traffic assignments developed, the impact of the
proposed project is isolated by comparing operational (i.e., Levels of Service) conditions at the
selected key intersections using existing and expected future traffic volumes with and without
forecast project traffic. The need for site-specific and/or cumulative local area traffic improvements
can then be evaluated and the significance of the project's impacts identified.

7.1        Project Traffic Generation
Traffic generation is expressed in vehicle trip ends, defined as one-way vehicular movements, either
entering or exiting the generating land use. Generation equations and/or rates provided in the ITE
Trip Generation, 9th Edition publication, and in the San Diego Association of Governments
(SANDAG) (Not So) Brief Guide of Vehicular Traffic Generation Rates for the San Diego Region 7.
Traffic volumes expected to be generated by the proposed project were based upon rates per number
of dwelling units for the multi-family residential land use component and per thousand square feet of
building floor area for the retail land use component. ITE Land Use Code 220 (Apartment) trip
generation average rates were used to forecast the traffic volumes expected to be generated by the
multi-family residential land use. SANDAG trip generation average rates for Specialty Retail/Strip
Commercial were used to forecast the traffic volumes expected to be generated by the retail land use.

The ITE manual contains trip rates for a variety of land uses (including office buildings, shopping
centers, condominiums, etc.), which have been derived based on traffic counts conducted at existing
sites. However, the traffic count data submitted to ITE is for free-standing sites generally located in
suburban locations, which likely do not reflect the trip generation characteristics for projects located in

urban areas such as the City of Pasadena's transit oriented district TOD areas. Thus, the trip rates
provided in the ITE Trip Generation manual (derived from traffic counts at suburban projects) would be
expected to overstate the trip generation potential of projects located in the Allen Avenue TOD,
including the proposed East Walnut Street Mixed-Use project.

As stated on page 1 of the ITE Trip Generation, 9th Edition, User's Guide: "Data were primarily
collected at suburban locations having little or no transit service, nearby pedestrian amenities, or travel
demand management (TDM) programs. At specific sites, the user may wish to modify trip generation
rates presented in this document to reflect the presence of public transportation service, ridesharing, or
other TDM measures; enhanced pedestrian and bicycle trip-making opportunities; or other special
characteristics of the site or surrounding area. When practical, the user is encouraged to supplement the
data in this document with local data that have been collected at similar sites." The area adjacent to the
project site provides public transportation service, as well as enhanced pedestrian and bicycle trip-
making opportunities. Accordingly, as encouraged by ITE, additional trip generation data was reviewed
at existing development sites in urban areas similar to Pasadena. Two recent research efforts by the
Transportation Research Board 8 (the "TRB" report) and California Department of Transportation9 (the
"Caltrans report") have been conducted for purposes of evaluating the trip generation characteristics at
development sites located in urban areas in close proximity to transit stations/hubs.

The TRB report evaluated trip generation at 17 TOD sites in four urbanized areas of the country:
Philadelphia/Northeast New Jersey; Portland, Oregon; metropolitan Washington, D.C.; and the San
Francisco East Bay area. The 17 TOD sites studied are residential developments. Driveway traffic
counts conducted at the TOD sites were compared to the forecast trip generation that would be
calculated using applicable and unadjusted trip rates from the ITE Trip Generation manual. Based
on the traffic count data collected at the TODs, the TRB report concludes the following:

     ·     Daily (24-hour): 44% fewer vehicle trips at TODs as compared to ITE trip rates

     ·     AM peak hour: 49% fewer vehicle trips at TODs as compared to ITE trip rates

     ·     PM peak hour: 48% fewer vehicle trips at TODs as compared to ITE trip rates

The Caltrans report evaluated trip generation at eight urban infill sites located in close proximity to
transit stations and/or transit hubs in the Berkeley and San Diego areas (thus considered as TOD
sites for purposes of this analysis). The eight TOD sites studied are residential developments.
Driveway traffic counts conducted at the TOD sites were compared to the forecast trip generation
that would be calculated using applicable and unadjusted trip rates from the ITE Trip Generation

                                                                                             O:\JOB_FILE\4011\Report\4011-Rpt2.doc

manual 10. Based on the traffic count data collected at the TOD sites, the Caltrans report concludes
the following:

       ·   AM peak hour: 61% fewer vehicle trips at TOD sites as compared to ITE trip rates

       ·   PM peak hour: 60% fewer vehicle trips at TOD sites as compared to ITE trip rates

It is therefore demonstrated in the TRB and Caltrans reports that vehicular trip generation is
substantially reduced at TOD sites as compared to what would otherwise be forecast through use of
the ITE trip rates (derived from studies of generally suburban and stand-alone development
projects). Further, it is reasonable to conclude that travel related to the sites studied in the TRB and
Caltrans reports comprised a mixture of trips by walking, bicycles and public transit, with reduced
emphasis on travel by the automobile. Also, as the sites studied by TRB and Caltrans were
residential projects, it is reasonable to assume that the sites studied in the TRB and Caltrans reports
were passively managed from a traffic management standpoint. That is; travelers used travel modes
other than the automobile based on convenience and/or cost savings.

For the East Walnut Mixed-Use project, it is reasonable to conclude that its design and location in
Pasadena near multimodal corridors and the Metro Gold Line Allen Avenue station would result in a
significant reduction in vehicle trips as compared to the trip forecasts that would otherwise be
calculated using the applicable and unadjusted ITE trip rates in a passively managed traffic
management condition. An actively managed site could be expected to yield additional trip
reductions. As indicated in data provided in the 2010 Los Angeles County Congestion Management
Program, a transit adjustment factor of 10 percent (10.0%) would be applicable to the proposed
project based on the project's proximity to a transit center (i.e., a fixed facility that consolidates and
supports passenger loading, including Metro Rail Red, Blue, Gold and Green Lines, and commuter
rails served by Metrolink as well as major bus transfer centers) and public bus transit routes in the
area. However, based on direction from PasDOT, a five percent (5%) adjustment has been utilized
in order to provide a conservative forecast of project-related trips. This transit adjustment was
applied only to the residential land use component trip generation forecasts in order to provide a
conservative trip generation forecast.

An internal capture adjustment was applied to the retail land use component to account for the
synergistic effects of the proposed land use mix at the site, as well as neighborhood walk-ins for the
local community serving commercial/retail use. Internal capture trips are those trips made internal
to the site between land uses in a mixed-use development. When combined within a mixed-use
development, land uses tend to interact, and thus attract a portion of each other's trip generation.
The internal capture adjustments were estimated based on the methodology and recommended
practice as described in the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, June 2004.

Traffic volumes to be generated by the existing project site automobile service use was also forecast
for the weekday AM and PM peak hours, and over a 24-hour period, using trip generation rates in
the ITE Trip Generation, 9th Edition publication. ITE Land Use Code 942 (Automobile Care
Service) trip generation average rates were used to forecast the traffic volumes expected to be
generated by the existing automobile service land use located on the project site. However, it is
noted that trip adjustments were not included in the project trip generation forecast to account for the
prior lumber yard land use on the project site due to the length of time since it has been operational.

The trip generation rates and forecast of the vehicular trips anticipated to be generated by the
proposed project are presented in Table 7-1. The project trip generation forecast was submitted for
review and acceptance by PasDOT staff. As summarized in Table 7-1, the proposed project is
expected to generate a net increase of 59 vehicle trips (11 inbound trips and 48 outbound trips)
during the weekday AM peak hour. During the weekday PM peak hour, the proposed project is
expected to generate a net increase of 80 vehicle trips (51 inbound trips and 29 outbound trips).
Over a 24-hour period, the proposed project is forecast to generate a net increase of 883 daily trip
ends during a typical weekday (approximately 442 inbound trips and 442 outbound trips).

7.2        Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
Project traffic volumes both entering and exiting the site have been distributed and assigned to the
adjacent street system based on the following considerations:

      ·    The site's proximity to major traffic corridors (i.e., Allen Avenue, Walnut Street, Colorado
           Boulevard, etc.);

      ·    Expected localized traffic flow patterns based on adjacent roadway channelization and
           presence of traffic signals;

      ·    Existing site parcel access ingress/egress schemes;

      ·    Ingress/egress scheme planned for the proposed project; and

      ·    Input from PasDOT staff.

The general, directional traffic distribution patterns for the proposed project are presented in Figures
7-1 and 7-2 for the residential and retail land use components, respectively. The forecast net new
weekday AM and PM peak hour project traffic volumes at the study intersections associated with the
proposed project are presented in Figures 7-3 and 7-4, respectively. The traffic volume assignments
presented in Figures 7-3 and 7-4 reflect the traffic distribution characteristics shown in Figures 7-1
and 7-2 and the project traffic generation forecasts presented in Table 7-1.

8.0        TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
8.1        Study Intersections
8.1.1 Intersection Analysis Methodology
The seven study intersections were evaluated using the Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU)
method of analysis which determines Volume-to-Capacity (v/c) ratios on a critical lane basis. The
overall intersection v/c ratio is subsequently assigned a Level of Service (LOS) value to describe
intersection operations. Level of Service varies from LOS A (free flow) to LOS F (jammed
condition). A description of the ICU method and corresponding Level of Service is provided in
Appendix B.

8.1.2 City of Pasadena Intersection Impact Criteria and Thresholds
The relative impact of the added project traffic volumes to be generated by the proposed East Walnut
Street Mixed-Use project during the weekday AM and PM peak hours was evaluated based on
analysis of existing and future operating conditions at the study intersections, without and with the
proposed project. The previously discussed capacity analysis procedures were utilized to evaluate
the future v/c relationships and service level characteristics at each study intersection.

The significance of the potential impacts of project-generated traffic at each study intersection was
identified using criteria set forth in the City of Pasadena's Transportation Impact Review Current
Practice and Guidelines. According to the City's Sliding Scale Method for calculating the level of
impact due to traffic generated by the proposed project, a significant transportation impact is
determined based on the criteria presented in Table 8-1.

             > 0.800 - 0.900                           D                equal to or greater than 0.03
             > 0.900 - 1.000                           E                equal to or greater than 0.02
                   > 1.000                             F                equal to or greater than 0.01


The City's Sliding Scale Method requires mitigation of project traffic impacts whenever traffic
generated by the proposed development causes an increase of the analyzed intersection v/c ratio by
an amount equal to or greater than the values shown above.

The ICU calculations use a lane capacity of 1,700 vehicles per hour (vph) for left-turn, through and
right-turn lanes, and a dual turn lane capacity of 3,060 vph. A clearance interval of 0.10 is also
included in the ICU calculations.

8.1.3 City of Pasadena Intersection Traffic Impact Analysis Scenarios
Traffic impacts at the study intersections were analyzed for the following conditions:

           [a]        Existing conditions.

           [b]        Existing with project conditions.

           [c]        Condition [b] with implementation of project mitigation measures, where necessary.

           [d]        Condition [a] plus 1.5 percent (1.5%) ambient traffic growth through year 2015.

           [e]        Condition [d] with completion and occupancy of the related projects.

           [f]        Condition [e] with completion and occupancy of the proposed project.

           [g]        Condition [f] with implementation of project mitigation measures, where necessary.

The traffic volumes for each new condition were added to the volumes in the prior condition to
determine the change in capacity utilization at the study intersections.

8.2        City of Pasadena Street Segment Impact Criteria and Thresholds
As required by City of Pasadena traffic study guidelines, existing and net new project Average Daily
Traffic (ADT) volumes were determined at four street segment locations in the vicinity of the
proposed East Walnut Street Mixed-Use project. The City of Pasadena ADT impact threshold
criteria for street segments are listed in Table 8­2.

9.0        TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
The traffic impact analysis prepared for the study intersections using the ICU methodology and
application of the City of Pasadena significant traffic impact criteria is summarized in Table 9-1.
The CMA data worksheets for the analyzed intersections are contained in Appendix B.

9.1        Study Intersections Analysis
9.1.1 Existing Conditions
As indicated in column [1] of Table 9-1, all seven study intersections are presently operating at LOS
D or better during the weekday AM and PM peak hours under existing conditions. As previously
mentioned, the existing traffic volumes at the study intersections during the weekday AM and PM
peak hours are displayed in Figures 5-1 and 5-2, respectively.

9.1.2 Existing With Project Conditions
As shown in column [2] of Table 9­1, application of the City's threshold criteria to the "Existing
With Project" scenario indicates that the proposed project is not expected to create significant
impacts at any of the seven study intersections. Incremental, but not significant, impacts are noted at
the study intersections. Because there are no significant impacts, no traffic mitigation measures are
required or recommended for the study intersections under the "Existing With Project" conditions.
The existing with project traffic volumes at the study intersections during the weekday AM and PM
peak hours are illustrated in Figures 9­1 and 9­2, respectively.

9.1.3 Future Without Project With Ambient Growth Conditions
Growth in traffic due to the combined effects of continuing development, intensification of existing
developments and other factors was assumed to be 1.5 percent (1.5%) per year through year 2015.
This ambient growth incrementally increases the v/c ratios at all of the study intersections. As
shown in column [3] of Table 9-1, all seven study intersections are expected to continue operating at
LOS D or better during the weekday AM and PM peak hours with the addition of ambient growth
traffic through the year 2015. The future without project with ambient growth (existing with
ambient growth) traffic volumes at the study intersections during the weekday AM and PM peak
hours are shown in Figures 9-3 and 9-4, respectively.

9.1.4 Future Without Project With Ambient Growth and Related Projects Conditions
The v/c ratios at all of the study intersections are incrementally increased with the addition of traffic
generated by the related projects listed in Table 6-1. As presented in column [4] of Table 9-1, six of
the seven study intersections are expected to continue operating at LOS D or better during the
weekday AM and PM peak hours with the addition of growth in ambient traffic and the traffic due to
the related projects. The following study intersection is expected to operate at LOS E during the
peak hour shown below with the addition of related projects traffic:

The future without project with ambient growth and related projects traffic volumes at the study
intersections during the weekday AM and PM peak hours are presented in Figures 9-5 and 9-6,
respectively.

9.1.5 Future With Project Conditions
As shown in column [5] of Table 9­1, application of the City's threshold criteria to the "With
Proposed Project" scenario indicates that the proposed project is not expected to create significant
impacts at any of the seven study intersections. Incremental, but not significant, impacts are noted at
the study intersections. Because there are no significant impacts, no traffic mitigation measures are
required or recommended for the study intersections. The future with project (existing, ambient
growth, related projects and project) traffic volumes at the study intersections during the weekday
AM and PM peak hours are illustrated in Figures 9­7 and 9­8, respectively.

9.2        Study Street Segment Analysis
The existing and forecast existing with project volumes at the street segment study locations are
summarized in Table 9­2. The existing ADT volume is shown in column [1]. The total net new
project ADT volumes at the study locations are shown in column [2]. Finally, the project-related
percent increases in ADT growth for the analyzed street segments are presented in column [3].

Application of the City's threshold criteria indicates that the proposed project is not expected to
create significant impacts at any of the four study street segments. As indicated in Table 9­2, the
proposed project is forecast to increase ADT volumes on the study street segments as summarized
below:

      ·    Street Segment No. 1:       2.2 percent (2.2%)

      ·    Street Segment No. 2:       1.4 percent (1.4%)

      ·    Street Segment No. 3:       0.5 percent (0.5%)

      ·    Street Segment No. 4:       1.0 percent (1.0%)

9.3        Pedestrian Environmental Quality Index Analysis
The Pedestrian Environmental Quality Index (PEQI) is a quantitative, observational instrument used
to describe and summarize the street and intersection environmental factors known to affect people's
travel behaviors. The PEQI was developed by the San Francisco Department of Public Health as a
tool to assess pedestrian safety and needs as well as to gain attention and demand for pedestrian
planning. As outlined in Pedestrian Environmental Quality Index (PEQI): An assessment of the
physical condition of streets and intersections, Draft Methods Report 11, and the Pedestrian
Environmental Quality Index, Street Auditor's Training Manual 12, the PEQI consists of 19 street
segment and 8 intersection factors associated with pedestrian environmental quality and safety,
classified into a total of five categories for street segments and intersections: Intersection Safety,
Traffic, Street Design, Land Use and Perceived Safety. PEQI data is primarily collected with an
observational survey, completed for each individual intersection and street segment. Indicator scores
for each indicator category are based on a survey of national experts, including City and
transportation planners and consultants regarding the importance of each indicator to pedestrian
environmental quality. PEQI scores reflect the degree to which environmental factors supportive of
walking and pedestrian safety has been incorporated into street segment and intersection design.
The PEQI analysis results in a score for street segments and intersections on a scale ranging between
0-100 as outlined below.

      ·    PEQI Score 100 ­ 81: Highest Quality (many important pedestrian conditions present)

      ·    PEQI Score 80 ­ 61: High Quality (some important pedestrian conditions present)

      ·    PEQI Score 60 ­ 41: Average Quality (pedestrian conditions present but room for
           improvement)

      ·    PEQI Score 40 ­ 21: Low Quality (minimal pedestrian conditions present)

      ·    PEQI Score 20 and below: Poor Quality (pedestrian conditions absent)

Two segments along the project frontage on Allen Avenue and Walnut Street have been identified
by City staff for analysis:

      ·    Allen Avenue between Locust Street and Walnut Street

      ·    Walnut Street between Meridith Avenue and Allen Avenue

Observational surveys were conducted along Allen Avenue and Walnut Street to document existing
pedestrian and street quality conditions. Vehicle traffic features (i.e., number of lanes, vehicle
speed, etc.) as well as street quality features (i.e., sidewalk widths and impediments, obstructions,
driveway cuts, land use characteristics, etc.) were collected for both east and west sides of Allen
Avenue as well as the north and south sides of Walnut Street. Manual traffic count data for the
Allen Avenue/Walnut Street intersection were also reviewed to determine the existing conditions
PEQI score for these segments.

The PEQI analysis scoring for existing conditions for Allen Avenue and Walnut Street are
summarized in Tables 9­3 and 9-4. As shown in Table 9-3, the PEQI scores for the east and west
sides of Allen Avenue under existing conditions are 47 and 51, respectively, which fall within a
range considered to be of average quality (i.e., some pedestrian conditions present but has room for
improvement). As shown in Table 9-4, the PEQI scores for the north and south sides of Walnut
Street under existing conditions are 41 and 44, respectively, which fall within a range considered to
be of average quality (i.e., some important pedestrian conditions present but has room for
improvement). A summary of the PEQI indicator, domain, and overall street segment score values
used in this analysis is provided in Appendix C.

10.0 TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT MEASURES
The following sections provide an overview of transportation improvement measures that are
anticipated to address impacts to the local roadway network associated with the proposed project
alternatives. It is important to note that the traffic analysis has been based on a conservative
approach with respect to the analysis of potential project-related impacts.

10.1       Study Intersections
As summarized in Subsections 9.1.2 (Existing With Project Conditions) and 9.1.5 (Future With
Project Conditions) herein, application of the City's threshold criteria to the with proposed project
scenarios indicates that the proposed project is not expected to create significant impacts at the seven
study intersections. Incremental, but not significant, impacts are noted at the study intersections.
Because there are no significant impacts, no traffic mitigation measures are required or
recommended for the study intersections.

10.2       Summary of Street Segment Improvement Measures
As summarized in Subsections 9.2 (Study Street Segment Analysis) herein, application of the City's
threshold criteria to the with proposed project scenarios indicates that the proposed project is not
expected to create significant impacts at the four study street segments. However, as noted in the
City's traffic study guidelines (i.e., for ADT growth on street segments ranging from 0.00 to 2.4%),
the project-related level of ADT growth on the analyzed street segments is subject to staff review
and conditions.

10.3       Traffic Reduction and Transportation Improvement Fee
The City of Pasadena has established the Traffic Reduction and Transportation Improvement Fee
(TR-TIF) program consistent with the General Plan and Government Code Section 66477. The
purpose of the fee is to promote the general health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City of
Pasadena through assurance that an adequate level of service on the City's transportation system can
be maintained through the implementation of the street and transit improvements identified in the
Mobility Element. Revenues from the TR-TIF program will be used to fund key intersection
improvements, complete roadway extension projects identified in the Mobility Element and fund
improvements to manage traffic on designated multimodal corridors. Additionally, approximately
one-half of the funds collected through the program will be allocated towards improvements to the
ARTS system and to provide significant enhancements to the local transit service encouraging non-
automobile travel throughout the City.

11.0 CONGESTION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TRAFFIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The Congestion Management Program (CMP) is a state-mandated program that was enacted by the
State Legislature with the passage of Proposition 111 in 1990. The program is intended to address
the impact of local growth on the regional transportation system.

As required by the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County, a Traffic
Impact Assessment (TIA) has been prepared to determine the potential impacts on designated
monitoring locations on the CMP highway system. The analysis has been prepared in accordance
with procedures outlined in the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County,
County of Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority, July 2010.

11.1       Intersections
The following CMP intersection monitoring locations in the project vicinity have been identified:

     ·     CMP Station                 Intersection

           No. 119                     Arroyo Parkway/California Boulevard

           No. 120                     Pasadena Avenue-Saint John Avenue/California Boulevard

           No. 121                     Rosemead Boulevard/Foothill Boulevard

The CMP TIA guidelines require that intersection monitoring locations must be examined if the
proposed project will add 50 or more trips during either the weekday AM or PM peak hours. The
proposed project will not add 50 or more trips during either the weekday AM or PM peak hours (i.e.,
of adjacent street traffic) at CMP monitoring intersections, as stated in the CMP manual as the
threshold criteria for a traffic impact assessment. Therefore, no further review of potential impacts
to intersection monitoring locations that are part of the CMP highway system is required.

11.2       Freeways
The following CMP freeway monitoring locations in the project vicinity have been identified:

     ·     CMP Station                 Segment

           No. 1056                    Route 134 Freeway west of San Rafael Avenue

           No. 1060                    I-210 Freeway west of Routes 134-710

           No. 1061                    I-210 Freeway at Rosemead Boulevard

                                                                                East Walnut Street Mixed-Use Project
                                                                                     O:\JOB_FILE\4011\Report\4011-Rpt2.doc

The CMP TIA guidelines require that freeway monitoring locations must be examined if the
proposed project will add 150 or more trips (in either direction) during either the weekday AM or
PM peak periods. The proposed project will not add 150 or more trips (in either direction) during
either the weekday AM or PM peak hours to CMP freeway monitoring locations which is the
threshold for preparing a traffic impact assessment, as stated in the CMP manual. Therefore, no
further review of potential impacts to freeway monitoring locations that are part of the CMP
highway system is required.

11.3       Transit Impact Review
As required by the 2010 Congestion Management Program, a review has been made of the potential
impacts of the project on transit service. As discussed in Subsection 4.5 herein, existing transit
service is provided in the vicinity of the proposed East Walnut Street Mixed-Use project.

The project trip generation, as shown in Table 7­1, was adjusted by values set forth in the CMP (i.e.,
person trips equal 1.4 times vehicle trips, and transit trips equal 10.0 percent of the total person trips)
to estimate transit trip generation. Pursuant to the CMP guidelines, the proposed project is forecast
to generate demand for 8 transit trips during the weekday AM peak hour and 11 transit trips during
the weekday PM peak hour. Over a 24-hour period, the proposed project is forecast to generate
demand for 124 weekday daily transit trips. Therefore, the calculations are as follows:

     ·     Weekday AM Peak Hour = 59 × 1.4 × 0.10 = 8 Transit Trips

     ·     Weekday PM Peak Hour = 80 × 1.4 × 0.10 = 11 Transit Trips

     ·     Weekday Daily Trips = 883 × 1.4 × 0.10 = 124 Transit Trips

As shown in Table 4­1, seven bus transit lines and routes are provided adjacent to or in close
proximity the project site. As outlined in Table 4­1, under the "No. of Buses/Trains During Peak
Hour" column, these seven transit lines provide services for an average of (i.e., average of the
directional number of buses during the peak hours) generally 52 and 53 buses during the weekday
AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, based on the above calculated weekday AM and PM peak hour
trips, this would correspond to less than one additional transit rider per bus. It is anticipated that the
existing transit service in the project area will adequately accommodate the increase of project-
generated transit trips. Thus, given the number of project-generated transit trips per bus, no project
impacts on existing or future transit services in the project area are expected to occur due to the
proposed project.

12.0 CONCLUSIONS
The East Walnut Street Mixed-Use project is located within the College District sub-area of the East
Colorado Boulevard Specific Plan and directly across (i.e., diagonal) from the Pasadena City College
campus. It is concluded that the proposed project is not expected to create significant impacts at the
seven study intersections. Incremental, but not significant, impacts are noted at the study
intersections. Additionally, it is concluded that the proposed project is not expected to create
significant impacts at any of the four study street segments. However, as noted in the City's traffic
study guidelines (i.e., for ADT growth on street segments ranging from 0.00 to 2.4%), the project-
related level of ADT growth on the analyzed street segments is subject to staff review and
conditions. In addition, the project will be required to contribute funds toward the City of
Pasadena's Trip Reduction/ Traffic Improvement Fee.

Level of Service is a term used to describe prevailing conditions and their effect on traffic. Broadly interpreted, the Levels of Service
concept denotes any one of a number of differing combinations of operating conditions which may occur as a roadway is
accommodating various traffic volumes. Level of Service is a qualitative measure of the effect of such factors as travel speed, travel
time, traffic interruptions, freedom to maneuver, safety, driving comfort and convenience.

Six Levels of Service, A through F, have been defined in the 1965 Highway Capacity Manual, published by the Transportation Research
Board. Level of Service A describes a condition of free flow, with low traffic volumes and relatively high speeds, while Level of Service
F describes forced traffic flow at low speeds with jammed conditions and queues which cannot clear during the green phases.

The Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) method of intersection capacity analysis has been used in our studies. It directly relates
traffic demand and available capacity for key intersection movements, regardless of present signal timing, The capacity per hour of
green time for each approach is calculated based on the methods of the Highway Capacity Manual. The proportion of total signal time
needed by each key movement is determined and compared to the total time available (100 percent of the hour). The result of summing
the requirements of the conflicting key movements plus an allowance for clearance times is expressed as a decimal fraction. Conflicting
key traffic movements are those opposing movements whose combined green time requirements are greatest.

The resulting ICU represents the proportion of the total hour required to accommodate intersection demand volumes if the key
conflicting traffic movements are operating at capacity. Other movements may be operating near capacity, or may be operating at
significantly better levels. The ICU may be translated to a Level of Service as tabulated below.

The Levels of Service (abbreviated from the Highway Capacity Manual) are listed here with their corresponding ICU and Load Factor
equivalents. Load Factor is that proportion of the signal cycles during the peak hour which are fully loaded; i.e. when all of the vehicles
waiting at the beginning of green are not able to clear on that green phase.

SERVICE LEVEL A
There are no loaded cycles and few are even close to loaded at this service level. No approach phase is fully utilized by traffic and no
vehicle waits longer than one red indication.

SERVICE LEVEL B
This level represents stable operation where an occasional approach phase is fully utilized and a substantial number are approaching full
use. Many drivers begin to feel restricted within platoons of vehicles.

SERVICE LEVEL C
At this level stable operation continues. Loading is still intermittent but more frequent than at Level B. Occasionally drivers may have
to wait through more than one red signal indication and backups may develop behind turning vehicles. Most drivers feel somewhat
restricted, but not objectionably so.

SERVICE LEVEL D
This level encompasses a zone of increasing restriction approaching instability at the intersection. Delays to approaching vehicles may
be substantial during short peaks within the peak hour, but enough cycles with lower demand occur to permit periodic clearance of
queues, thus preventing excessive backups. Drivers frequently have to wait through more than one red signal. This level is the lower
limit of acceptable operation to most drivers.

SERVICE LEVEL E
This represents near capacity and capacity operation. At capacity (ICU = 1.0) it represents the most vehicles that the particular
intersection can accommodate. However, full utilization of every signal cycle is seldom attained no matter how great the demand. At
this level all drivers wait through more than one red signal, and frequently through several.

SERVICE LEVEL F
Jammed conditions. Traffic backed up from a downstream location on one of the street restricts or prevents movement of traffic through
the intersection under consideration.

San Bernardino Valley College
Master Plan
1.0     INTRODUCTION

This report presents an assessment of potential air quality impacts associated with
implementation of the San Bernardino Valley College (SBVC) Master Plan. San Bernardino
Valley College (SBVC) is an 87-acre community college campus in the San Bernardino
Community College District (SBCCD). It is one of three facility locations in the SBCCD, which
also includes Crafton Hills College, located approximately 16 miles east in the City of Yucaipa,
and the SBCCD administrative offices, Professional Development Center, and Applied
Technology Training Center. The SBVC Master Plan area is located in the City of San
Bernardino area. SBVC is located at 701 South Mount Vernon Avenue in the City of San
Bernardino. The campus is bounded by Esperanza Street to the north, K Street to the east, Grant
Avenue to the south, and Mount Vernon Avenue to the west. The Master Plan area is easily
accessed from I-215, located 0.5 mile to the east and I-10, located 1.5 miles to the south. SBVC
is surrounded by single-family residential developments to the north and east, and commercial
developments to the south and west.


The master planning process identified three significant challenges at SBVC: the San Jacinto
Fault and its impact on existing and future buildings; the loss of campus organization as a result
of the fault; and the disintegration of campus identity from demolition of buildings (Steinberg
Architects 2009). The goals of the Master Plan are to meet these challenges.


The San Jacinto fault has a tremendous impact at SBVC. On the campus, two lines of the fault
run parallel to each other and have a required 50-foot setback to either side, creating a zone in
which no structures are allowed. Additionally, a folding zone exists to the northeast of the fault,
caused by the relative movement of two tectonic plates underneath the earth's surface. It is not
recommended that new structures be built within the folding zone. The unbuildable zone created
by the fault and folding zones is approximately 18 acres.

The original campus consisted of a traditional framework of buildings arranged around open
landscape quads and hardscape plazas. Structures were parallel and perpendicular to the City
street grid, typically two stories in height and in the mission revival style. Buildings constructed
in the 1960s and 1970s were more utilitarian in style, but in configuration reinforced the network

of quads and plazas. When the fault was discovered, the necessary demolition destroyed the
original framework of the campus. Because of structural engineering recommendations, new
buildings were placed either parallel or perpendicular to the fault and folding zones, making
them skewed in relation to existing buildings that were oriented to the street grid. With the
network of quads and plazas defined by the original buildings gone, the logical sequence of
circulation was lost.


Because new construction should not be within the fault or folding zones, the first replacement
buildings were located in available space on campus, primarily parking lots at the edges of
campus. This has led to a perceived separation between the north and south sides of campus,
which are divided by the 18-acre unbuildable zone.


1.1       Project Goals

The Master Plan will create connections that link and unify the campus and community to foster
a positive memorable experience and identity through the following planning principles
(Steinberg Architects 2009):

      ·   Student-centered Culture
             o Large central gathering place
             o Distinct districts
             o Sufficient parking
             o Serve the West Valley population

      ·   Hierarchy of Elements
             o Campus edges/transitions from the campus to the community
             o Delineation of primary and secondary campus entrances
             o Variety of exterior spaces

      ·   Access
             o Vehicular/pedestrian circulation
             o Accessible paths and buildings
             o Wayfinding

      ·   Sustainable Design
             o Respond to natural environment
             o Flexibility of space (long-term use)
             o Energy efficiency

San Bernardino Valley College
Master Plan
     ·   Functional Integration
            o Consolidate instructional divisions
            o Active and passive exterior spaces
            o Interior/exterior connections


The proposed Master Plan estimates that various academic buildings, infrastructure
improvements, and associated parking are required to meet the planning challenges related to the
fault and folding zone, which creates an 18-acre unbuildable area on the campus. Improvements
are also required to support a future enrollment of 15,000 total students by 2020 and 17,000 total
students by 2030. The Master Plan does not constitute a mandate for growth, nor is it a detailed
implementation plan for development. Its adoption does not constitute a commitment to any
specific project details, construction schedule, or funding priority. Rather, the Master Plan
describes a program of potential development for the campus through buildout. The funding,
scheduling, and details of each development project undertaken during the planning horizon will
be subject to individual approval by the SBCCD. Table 1-1 shows the projected increases in
student enrollment, building area, and parking over the planning period.

                              2,715            3,182         3,055         3,349

Notes:
         ASF= Assignable square feet or the sum of all surface areas in a building that are assigned.
         * Parking includes on-site and on-street parking supplies. Only the 2008 Estimate includes use of the Swap Meet.




It should be noted that SBVC is currently overbuilt; it has more square footage than required for
its current enrollment. Therefore, many of the projects in the Master Plan that replace outdated
buildings would also accommodate growth without a significant increase in the overall square
footage of assignable space on the campus.

Master Plan
The Master Plan for SBVC describes the improvements to SBVC in three phases, called
Horizons (Steinberg Architects 2009). The Horizons are described below.


1.2     Horizon 1

Horizon 1 targets the year 2010, and primarily consists of the construction of four buildings that
replace buildings within or near the San Jacinto fault folding zone (North Hall, Physical Science,
Chemistry, and Maintenance and Operations). The replacement is for seismic safety reasons, not
to accommodate an increase in student population. The replacement of these buildings was
initially funded by Measure P and State funding prior to the development of the Master Plan.
Therefore, a CEQA IS/MND was prepared for this building replacement project in 2007.


Also included in Horizon 1 is Parking Structure 1, a multi-level, 1,250-space parking structure
located on the south portion of campus with access from Grant Avenue and K Street. This
parking structure facility was not included in the CEQA IS/MND prepared for the Measure P
projects.

 1.3      Horizon 2

 Horizon 2 targets the year 2020 and is defined by the replacement of structures identified in the
 assessment study as in the worst condition: the Liberal Arts Building, Gymnasiums and Pools,
 and Technical Building (Table 1-3). The existing Liberal Arts Building would be demolished and
 replaced with a new Liberal Arts Building. The old gymnasiums would be demolished and
 replaced with two new gymnasium buildings in roughly the same area. The softball field would
 be relocated, the baseball field would be resurfaced, and a new soccer field would be constructed
 along K Street. The track and football field would remain in their current locations, but new
 home and visitor stands would be added.

 Master Plan
The new Technical Building would anchor the northeast corner of the campus and provide the
program and campus with public visibility and access, improving the edge of the campus in this
location. The old Technical Building would be demolished and an approximately 200 to 250
space parking lot would be constructed in that location.

1.4      Horizon 3

Horizon 3 targets the year 2030 and represents the full buildout of the campus (Table 1-4). A
new Performing Arts Building would be constructed adjacent to Grant Avenue. Two new office
and classroom buildings would be constructed to support academic functions that have not yet
been assigned. A multi-level approximate 1,100 space parking structure (Parking Structure 2)
with tennis courts on the top level would be constructed at the parking lot that was formerly the
site of the old Technical Building.


The Planetarium would be demolished, and its function incorporated into one of the new or
existing buildings. A new outdoor stage and backdrop for the existing Greek Theater would be
built at its old location.

This Air Quality Technical Report includes an evaluation of existing conditions in the project
vicinity, an assessment of potential impacts associated with project construction, and an
evaluation of project operational impacts. The analysis was prepared pursuant to the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The analysis addresses criteria air pollutant impacts and
toxic air contaminant health impacts associated with the Project.


2.0     ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

2.1     Climate and Meteorology

The climate of San Bernardino County is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters
and is dominated by a semi-permanent high-pressure cell located over the Pacific Ocean. This
high-pressure cell maintains clear skies for much of the year. It also drives the dominant onshore
circulation and helps create two types of temperature inversions ­ subsidence and radiation ­ that
contribute to local air quality degradation.


Subsidence inversions occur during warmer months, as descending air associated with the
Pacific high-pressure cell comes into contact with cool marine air. The boundary between the
two layers of air represents a temperature inversion that traps pollutants below it. Radiation
inversions typically develop on winter nights with low wind speeds when air near the ground
cools by radiation and the air aloft remains warm. A shallow inversion layer that can trap
pollutants is formed between the two layers.


In the SBVC area, the nearest climatological monitoring station is located in the City of San
Bernardino. The normal daily maximum temperature is 96.6 ºF in July, and the normal daily
minimum temperature is 39.4 ºF in December and January, according to the Western Regional
Climate Center (WRCC 2006). The normal precipitation in the San Bernardino area is 16.07
inches annually, occurring primarily from November through March.


The nearest meteorological monitoring station to the SBVC campus is located in the City of
Fontana. A wind rose for the Fontana monitoring station is provided in Figure 1. The wind rose

southeast on occasion as well.

2.2     Regulatory Setting

The proposed project will be constructed in the City of San Bernardino, within the South Coast
Air Basin (SCAB) inland area. The following subsections present a summary of air quality
regulatory requirements for the Project.


Federal Regulatory Setting. Air quality is defined by ambient air concentrations of specific
pollutants identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be of
concern with respect to health and welfare of the general public. The EPA is responsible for
enforcing the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) of 1970 and its 1977 and 1990 Amendments. The
CAA required the EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), which
identify concentrations of pollutants in the ambient air below which no adverse effects on the
public health and welfare are anticipated. In response, the EPA established both primary and
secondary standards for six primary air pollutants (called "criteria" pollutants): ozone (O3),
sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), lead (Pb), and particulate
Air Quality Technical Report                     10                                    8/07/09

matter equal to or smaller than 10 microns in diameter (PM10). Primary standards are designed
to protect human health with an adequate margin of safety. Secondary standards are designed to
protect property and the public welfare from air pollutants in the atmosphere.


Areas that do not meet the NAAQS for a particular pollutant are considered to be "nonattainment
areas" for that pollutant. The South Coast Air Basin (SCAB) has historically been considered an
extreme nonattainment area for the 1-hour NAAQS for O3, which has been rescinded. On April
15, 2004, the SCAB was designated a "severe-17" nonattainment area for the 8-hour NAAQS for
O3. The SCAB is also considered a nonattainment area for CO, PM10, and PM2.5, and is a
maintenance area for NO2. The SCAB is in attainment/unclassifiable for the NAAQS for SO2
and lead.


Due to its status as a nonattainment area for the 8-hour NAAQS for O3 and a nonattainment area
for the new NAAQS for PM2.5, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is
required to develop and submit a new attainment plan for submittal to EPA in 2007 describing
plans and programs for attainment of the NAAQS. The SCAQMD is in the process of preparing
its update to the Air Quality Management Plan, which will provide the basis for the State
Implementation Plan and attainment of the NAAQS.


State Regulatory Setting. The California Air Resources Board (ARB) is the agency responsible
for regulation of air quality in the State of California. The CAA allows states to adopt ambient
air quality standards and other regulations provided they are at least as stringent as federal
standards.    The ARB has established the more stringent California Ambient Air Quality
Standards (CAAQS) for the six criteria pollutants through the California Clean Air Act of 1988,
and also has established CAAQS for additional pollutants, including sulfates, hydrogen sulfide,
vinyl chloride and visibility-reducing particles.        The SCAB is currently classified as a
nonattainment area under the CAAQS for O3, PM2.5, and PM10.


The ARB is the state regulatory agency with authority to enforce regulations to both achieve and
maintain the NAAQS and CAAQS. The ARB is responsible for the development, adoption, and
enforcement of the state's motor vehicle emissions program, as well as the adoption of the

Air Quality Technical Report                        11                                   8/07/09

Master Plan
CAAQS. The ARB also reviews operations and programs of the local air districts, and requires
each air district with jurisdiction over a nonattainment area to develop its own strategy for
achieving the NAAQS and CAAQS. The local air district has the primary responsibility for the
development and implementation of rules and regulations designed to attain the NAAQS and
CAAQS, as well as the permitting of new or modified sources, development of air quality
management plans, and adoption and enforcement of air pollution regulations.


Local Regulatory Setting. The SCAQMD is the local agency responsible for the administration
and enforcement of air quality regulations for the SCAB. The SCAQMD has jurisdiction over an
area of approximately 10,743 square miles, consisting of the four-county SCAB, the Mojave
Desert Air Basin (MDAB) and the Riverside County portions of the Salton Sea Air Basin
(SSAB). The SCAQMD develops and administers local regulations for stationary air pollutant
sources within the SCAB, and also develops plans and programs to meet attainment requirements
for the NAAQS and the CAAQS. In addition, the SCAQMD, along with the ARB, maintains
and operates ambient air quality monitoring stations at numerous locations throughout the SCAB
that monitor the ambient air quality.


The SCAQMD is responsible for developing and implementing the clean air plan for attainment
and maintenance of the ambient air quality standards in the SCAB. As discussed above, the
SCAQMD is in the process of developing its Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) for the
SCAB. The AQMP outlines the SCAQMD's plans and control measures designed to attain the
state air quality standards for O3. The AQMP serves as the air basin's input to the State
Implementation Plan (SIP), which is required under the Federal Clean Air Act for areas that are
out of attainment of air quality standards.


The AQMP includes information from the ARB and the Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG), including mobile and area source emissions, as well as information
regarding projected growth in the SCAB, to project future emissions and then determine from
that the strategies necessary for the reduction of emissions through regulatory controls. The
ARB mobile source emission projections and SCAG growth projections are based on population
and vehicle trends and land use plans developed by the cities and by the County as part of the

Air Quality Technical Report                      12                                    8/07/09

development of the County's General Plan. As such, projects that propose development that is
consistent with the growth anticipated by the general plans would be consistent with the AQMP.
If a project proposes development that is greater than that anticipated in the AQMP, the project
might be in conflict with the AQMP and SIP, and might have a potentially significant impact on
air quality.


The following specific descriptions of health effects for each of the criteria air pollutants
associated with project construction and operations are based on EPA (2005a) and
CARB (2001).


Ozone. O3 is considered a photochemical oxidant, which is a chemical that is formed when
reactive organic gases (ROG) and NOx, both byproducts of combustion, react in the presence of
ultraviolet light. Ozone is considered a respiratory irritant and prolonged exposure can reduce
lung function, aggravate asthma, and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections. Children
and those with existing respiratory diseases are at greatest risk from exposure to ozone.


Carbon monoxide. CO is a product of combustion, and the main source of CO in the SCAB is
from motor vehicle exhaust. CO is an odorless, colorless gas. CO affects red blood cells in the
body by binding to hemoglobin and reducing the amount of oxygen that can be carried to the
body's organs and tissues. CO can cause health effects to those with cardiovascular disease, and
can also affect mental alertness and vision.


Nitrogen dioxide. NO2 is also a by-product of fuel combustion, and is formed both directly as a
product of combustion and in the atmosphere through the reaction of nitrogen oxide (NO) with
oxygen. NO2 is a respiratory irritant and may affect those with existing respiratory illness,
including asthma. NO2 can also increase the risk of respiratory illness.


Fine particulate matter. Particulate matter, or PM10, refers to particulate matter with an
aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less.         Fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, refers to
particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 microns or less. Particulate matter in this
size range has been determined to have the potential to lodge in the lungs and contribute to

Master Plan
respiratory problems. PM10 and PM2.5 arise from a variety of sources, including road dust, diesel
exhaust, combustion, tire and brake wear, construction operations, and windblown dust. PM10
and PM2.5 can increase susceptibility to respiratory infections and can aggravate existing
respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis. PM2.5 is considered to have the
potential to lodge deeper in the lungs.


Sulfur dioxide. SO2 is a colorless, reactive gas that is produced from the burning of sulfur-
containing fuels such as coal and oil, and by other industrial processes. Generally, the highest
concentrations of SO2 are found near large industrial sources. SO2 is a respiratory irritant that
can cause narrowing of the airways leading to wheezing and shortness of breath. Long-term
exposure to SO2 can cause respiratory illness and aggravate existing cardiovascular disease.


Lead. Lead (Pb) in the atmosphere occurs as particulate matter. Lead has historically been
emitted from vehicles combusting leaded gasoline, as well as from industrial sources. With the
phase-out of leaded gasoline, large manufacturing facilities are the sources of the largest amounts
of lead emissions. Lead has the potential to cause gastrointestinal, central nervous system,
kidney, and blood diseases upon prolonged exposure. Lead is also classified as a probable
human carcinogen.


Sulfates. Sulfates are the fully oxidized ionic form of sulfur. In California, emissions of sulfur
compounds occur primarily from the combustion of petroleum-derived fuels (e.g., gasoline and
diesel fuel) that contain sulfur. This sulfur is oxidized to sulfur dioxide (SO2) during the
combustion process and subsequently converted to sulfate compounds in the atmosphere. The
conversion of SO2 to sulfates takes place comparatively rapidly and completely in urban areas of
California due to regional meteorological features. The CARB's sulfates standard is designed to
prevent aggravation of respiratory symptoms. Effects of sulfate exposure at levels above the
standard include a decrease in ventilatory function, aggravation of asthmatic symptoms, and an
increased risk of cardio-pulmonary disease. Sulfates are particularly effective in degrading
visibility, and, due to fact that they are usually acidic, can harm ecosystems and damage
materials and property.

Hydrogen Sulfide. H2S is a colorless gas with the odor of rotten eggs. It is formed during
bacterial decomposition of sulfur-containing organic substances. Also, it can be present in sewer
gas and some natural gas, and can be emitted as the result of geothermal energy exploitation.
Breathing H2S at levels above the standard would result in exposure to a very disagreeable odor.
In 1984, a CARB committee concluded that the ambient standard for H2S is adequate to protect
public health and to significantly reduce odor annoyance.


Vinyl Chloride. Vinyl chloride, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, is a colorless gas with a mild, sweet
odor. Most vinyl chloride is used to make polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic and vinyl products.
Vinyl chloride has been detected near landfills, sewage plants, and hazardous waste sites, due to
microbial breakdown of chlorinated solvents.      Short-term exposure to high levels of vinyl
chloride in air causes central nervous system effects, such as dizziness, drowsiness, and
headaches. Long-term exposure to vinyl chloride through inhalation and oral exposure causes
liver damage. Cancer is a major concern from exposure to vinyl chloride via inhalation. Vinyl
chloride exposure has been shown to increase the risk of angiosarcoma, a rare form of liver
cancer, in humans.


Table 2-1 presents a summary of the ambient air quality standards adopted by the federal and
California Clean Air Acts.

2.3     Existing Ambient Air Quality


The closest ambient air quality monitoring station to the project is the site at 4th Street in San
Bernardino.       The nearest monitoring station that measures SO2 is the Riverside-Rubidoux
station. Ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants measured at these monitoring stations
during the period 2006-2008 are presented in Table 2-2. Ambient air concentrations were
compared with the CAAQS and NAAQS. The data indicate that the area is in compliance with
both CAAQS and NAAQS for CO, NO2, and SO2. The state 8-hour CO standard was not
exceeded during this three-year period. Exceedances of the NAAQS for ozone were recorded
several times per year in the 2006-2008 time period. One exceedance of the NAAQS for PM10
was recorded in 2007 during the southern California fire event in October of that year.
Exceedances of the CAAQS for ozone PM10 and PM2.5 standards have been recorded at the San
Bernardino monitoring station.

2.4     Toxic Air Contaminants

Cancer Risk.      One of the primary health risks of concern due to exposure to toxic air
contaminants (TACs) is the risk of contracting cancer. The carcinogenic potential of TACs is a
particular public health concern because it is currently believed by many scientists that there is
no "safe" level of exposure to carcinogens, that is, any exposure to a carcinogen poses some risk
of causing cancer. Health statistics show that one in four people will contract cancer over their
lifetime, or 250,000 in a million, from all causes, including diet, genetic factors, and lifestyle
choices.

Noncancer Health Risks. Unlike carcinogens, for most noncarcinogens it is believed that there is
a threshold level of exposure to the compound below which it will not pose a health risk. The
California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) and California Office of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) have developed reference exposure levels (RELs) for
noncarcinogenic TACs that are health-conservative estimates of the levels of exposure at or
below which health effects are not expected. The noncancer health risk due to exposure to a

TAC is assessed by comparing the estimated level of exposure to the REL. The comparison is
expressed as the ratio of the estimated exposure level to the REL, called the hazard index (HI).

3.0      SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA



The SCAQMD has adopted significance thresholds in its SCAQMD CEQA Air Quality
Handbook (SCAQMD 1993) for air quality that define whether or not a project could have a
significant impact. These thresholds are arranged in three parts starting with the broadest and
narrowing to the most specific. The general thresholds are derived from Appendix G of the state
CEQA guidelines, and indicate that a project could have potentially significant impacts if it
would:

a.       Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan
b.       Violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air
         quality violation
c.       Result in cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the
         project region is non-attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality
         standard (including release emissions which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
         precursors).
d.       Expose sensitive receptors5 to substantial pollutant concentrations including air toxics
         such as diesel particulates. As adopted by the SCAQMD in their CEQA Air Quality
         handbook (Chapter 4), a sensitive receptor is a person in the population who is
         particularly susceptible to health effects due to exposure to an air contaminant than is the
         population at large. Sensitive receptors (and the facilities that house them) in proximity
         to localized CO sources, toxic air contaminants or odors are of particular concern.
e.       Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people; or
f.       Release substantial quantities of air contaminants beyond the boundaries of the premises
         upon which the stationary source emitting the contaminants is located.


The second level of significance set forth in the SCAQMD's significance thresholds presents
quantitative emissions thresholds by which to evaluate whether a project's impacts could have a
significant impact on air quality. The quantitative emission thresholds are included in Table 3-1.

In addition, the SCAQMD has adopted its Localized Significance Threshold (LST) methodology
(SCAQMD 2003), which provides guidance for evaluating the significance of impacts associated
with construction and operation using a dispersion model-based approach.                         The LST
methodology is based on dispersion modeling used to back-calculate the emissions that would
result in an exceedance of an air quality standard.              LSTs provide area-specific emission
thresholds above which a project could have a significant adverse impact on the ambient air
quality.


SBVC is located in Source-Receptor Area 34, the Central San Bernardino Valley area. Table 3-2
presents the LSTs for the Central San Bernardino Valley area.

In the event that emissions exceed these thresholds, modeling would be required to demonstrate
that the project's total air quality impacts result in ground-level concentrations that are below the
State and Federal Ambient Air Quality Standards (shown in Table 2-1), including appropriate
background levels (shown in Table 2-2).

In addition to impacts from criteria pollutants, project impacts may include emissions of
pollutants identified by the state and federal government as toxic air contaminants (TACs) or
Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs).


With regard to evaluating whether a project would have a significant impact on sensitive
receptors, air quality regulators typically define sensitive receptors as schools (Preschool-12th
Grade), hospitals, resident care facilities, residences or day-care centers, or other facilities that
may house individuals with health conditions that would be adversely impacted by changes in air
quality. Any project which has the potential to directly impact a sensitive receptor located within
one mile and results in a health risk greater than ten in one million would be deemed to have a
potentially significant impact.


The impacts associated with construction and operation of the project were evaluated for
significance based on these significance criteria.



4.0     CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS



Construction activities, including soil disturbance dust emissions and combustion pollutants from
on-site construction equipment and from off-site trucks hauling dirt, cement or building
materials, will create a temporary addition of pollutants to the local airshed. These emissions are
quite variable in both time and space and differ considerably among various construction
projects.    Such emission levels can, therefore, only be approximately estimated with a
corresponding uncertainty in precise ambient air quality impacts. Because of their temporary
nature, construction activity impacts have often been considered as having a less-than-significant
air quality impact. However, the cumulative impact from all simultaneous construction in the
basin is a major contributor to the overall pollution burden, especially for particulate matter
(PM10). A number of current SCAQMD strategies thus focus on dust control and on using
cleaner off-road equipment to reduce the role of construction in the poor air quality of the region.

Master Plan
Three types of dust emissions may be associated with construction. Large particulates are
generated that settle out again rapidly in close proximity to the source. A fraction of the material
is small enough to remain suspended in the air semi-indefinitely. The size cut-off for these total
suspended particulates (TSP) is around 30 microns in diameter. An even lesser fraction of TSP
is small enough to enter deep lung tissue. The size cut-off for particulate matter that is deeply
respirable is 10 microns or less and is called PM10. The ambient air quality standard is for PM10.
The PM10 fraction of TSP is assumed to be around 50 percent. Fine particulate matter, which is
considered particulate matter that is 2.5 microns or less, is called PM2.5. Depending on the type
of source, PM2.5 is a fraction of the PM10 emissions ranging from 21 percent to 99 percent
(SCAQMD 2006).


As discussed in Section 1.0, the SBVC Master Plan involves the development or redevelopment
of the Campus. The proposed project will involve a number of projects proposed for Horizon 1,
Horizon 2, and Horizon 3. Each Horizon involves demolition of existing campus buildings and
the construction of additional buildings to replace those facilities that will be demolished. For
the purpose of this analysis, it was assumed that the demolition would occur following
construction of the buildings proposed for each Horizon, so that activities and functions could be
moved from the old buildings into new buildings.          For conservative purposes, the overall
construction horizons were compressed to facilitate evaluation of a maximum emission scenario.

Construction emissions were estimated using the URBEMIS Model, Version 9.2.4 (Rimpo and
Associates 2007) and construction equipment estimates based on default values in the model.
Tables 4-1 through 4-3 provide a summary of the emission estimates for the individual
construction phases for each Horizon of the Master Plan. It was assumed that dust control
measures (watering three times daily) would be employed to reduce emissions of fugitive dust
during site grading and cut and fill operations. Refer to Appendix A for URBEMIS outputs.
Comparison with the LSTs was made assuming each site would be five acres and 100 meters
from the nearest receptor.

Master Plan
As shown in Tables 4-1 through 4-3, the emissions associated with individual construction
phases would be below the significance thresholds and LSTs for all Horizons.


Project construction would employ dust control measures (i.e., watering twice daily) and would
therefore be in compliance with strategies in the Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP,
SCAQMD 2003) for attaining and maintaining the air quality standards.                  The Project
construction would therefore not conflict or obstruct the implementation of the AQMP or
applicable portions of the SIP. Emissions are below the PM10 and PM2.5 significance thresholds
set forth by the SCAQMD. Furthermore, due to the fact that the construction phase of the
project is short-term in nature, Project construction would not result in emissions that would
violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality
violation, nor result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of PM10 or PM2.5.


Diesel exhaust particulate matter is known to the state of California as carcinogenic compounds.
The risks associated with exposure to substances with carcinogenic effects are typically
evaluated based on a lifetime of chronic exposure, which is defined in the California Air
Pollution Control Officers' Association (CAPCOA) Air Toxics "Hot Spots" Program Risk
Assessment Guidelines (CAPCOA 1993) as 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per
year, for 70 years. Diesel exhaust particulate matter would be emitted during the 30 months of
construction assumed for the Project from heavy equipment used in the construction process.
Because diesel exhaust particulate matter is considered to be carcinogenic, long-term exposure to
diesel exhaust emissions have the potential to result in adverse health impacts. Because of the
short-term nature of project construction and the location of construction some distance away
from residences where more frequent exposure would be possible, exposure to diesel exhaust
emissions during construction would not be significant.


5.0     OPERATIONAL IMPACTS

Student population is forecasted to increase regardless of Master Plan development. The Traffic
Study estimated increased ADT based on projected increases in enrollment whether the Master
Plan is implemented or not.

Master Plan
Operational emissions were calculated using the URBEMIS Model, Version 9.2.4, to take into
account area sources (energy use, landscaping, maintenance architectural coatings use) and
vehicle emissions, for each Horizon.


Because the majority of the emissions are attributable to on-road vehicles, the LST methodology
is not appropriate and emissions were not compared with LSTs. Tables 5-1 through 5-3 present
the operational emissions estimated for each Horizon.

 Maximum of summer and winter emissions from URBEMIS Model runs.


As shown in Tables 5-1 through 5-3, the emissions associated with the Master Plan would be less
than the daily significance thresholds, and no significant impacts are anticipated.


The potential for cumulative impacts exists during both construction and following
implementation of the Master Plan. Construction of Horizon 2 would occur while Horizon 1
operations occur; construction of Horizon 3 would occur while Horizon 1 and 2 operations
occur.   The maximum daily emissions would occur during construction of Horizon 3 and
operation of Horizons 1 and 2. Emissions for this scenario are presented in Table 5-4.

As shown in Table 5-4, maximum daily emissions during simultaneous construction and
operations would be below the SCAQMD's significance thresholds and impacts would be less
than significant.

Projects involving increases in traffic and/or traffic congestion may result in localized increases
in CO concentrations. To further evaluate whether the project would result in a significant
impact, additional modeling to assess whether the increases in traffic attributable to
implementation of the SBVC Master Plan would result in localized CO impacts.


The Traffic Impact Analysis evaluated whether or not there would be a decrease in the level of
service at the roadways and/or intersections affected by the Project. The potential for CO "hot
spots" was evaluated based on the results of the Traffic Impact Analysis. The Caltrans ITS
Transportation Project-Level Carbon Monoxide Protocol (Caltrans 1998) should be followed to
determine whether a CO "hot spot" is likely to form due to Project-generated traffic.            In
accordance with the Protocol, CO "hot spots" are typically evaluated when (a) the level of
service (LOS) of an intersection or roadway decreases to a LOS E or worse; (b) signalization
and/or channelization is added to an intersection; and (c) sensitive receptors such as residences,
commercial developments, schools, hospitals, etc. are located in the vicinity of the affected
intersection or roadway segment.


The Traffic Impact Analysis evaluated 14 intersections in the project vicinity to assess the traffic
conditions for each Horizon. Because Horizon 3 would result in the most traffic, Horizon 3
traffic was modeled for the intersections for which a degradation in LOS was projected. These
intersections were identified in the Traffic Impact Analysis as intersections for which the impact
would be significant, and include the following:


    ·   Esperanza Street and Mt. Vernon Avenue
    ·   Grant Avenue and K Street
    ·   Grant Avenue and J Street
    ·   Grant Avenue and I Street
    ·   Inland Center Drive and I Street
    ·   Colton Avenue and Mt. Vernon Avenue


To evaluate the potential for CO "hot spots," the procedures in the Caltrans ITS Transportation
Project-Level Carbon Monoxide Protocol (Caltrans 1998) were used. As recommended in the
Air Quality Technical Report                        30                                       8/07/09
San Bernardino Valley College
Master Plan
Protocol, CALINE4 modeling was conducted for the intersections identified above for the
scenario without Project traffic, and the Project scenarios. Modeling was conducted based on the
guidance in Appendix B of the Protocol to calculate maximum predicted 1-hour CO
concentrations. Predicted 1-hour CO concentrations were then scaled to evaluate maximum
predicted 8-hour CO concentrations using the recommended scaling factor of 0.7 for urban
locations.


Inputs to the CALINE4 model were obtained from the San Bernardino Valley College Master
Plan Transportation Impact Study (Fehr and Peers 2009). As recommended in the Protocol,
receptors were located at locations that were approximately 3 meters from the mixing zone, and
at a height of 1.8 meters. Average approach and departure speeds were conservatively assumed
to be 1 mph, and emission factors for that speed were estimated from the EMFAC2007 emissions
model (ARB 2007) for Horizon 3 conditions.


In accordance with the Caltrans ITS Transportation Project-Level Carbon Monoxide Protocol, it
is also necessary to estimate future background CO concentrations in the project vicinity to
determine the potential impact plus background and evaluate the potential for CO "hot spots"
due to the project. As a conservative estimate of background CO concentrations, the existing
maximum 1-hour background concentration of CO that was measured at the San Bernardino
monitoring station for the period 2006 to 2008 of 5.1 ppm was used to represent future maximum
background 1-hour CO concentrations. The existing maximum 8-hour background concentration
of CO that was measured at the San Bernardino monitoring station during the period from 2006
to 2008 of 4.45 ppm was also used to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum 8-hour
background concentrations in the project vicinity. CO concentrations in the future may be lower
as inspection and maintenance programs and more stringent emission controls are placed on
vehicles.


The CALINE4 model outputs are provided in Appendix A of this report. Table 5-5 presents a
summary of the predicted CO concentrations (impact plus background) for the intersections
evaluated. As shown in Table 5-5, the predicted CO concentrations would be substantially
below the 1-hour and 8-hour NAAQS and CAAQS for CO shown in Table 2-1 of this report.

Therefore, no exceedances of the CO standard are predicted, and the project would not cause or
contribute to a violation of this air quality standard.

Toxic air contaminants (TACs) may be emitted from processes at SBVC, including
laboratory/classroom      chemical   use    and   chemicals    used   for   maintenance   purposes.
Implementation of the Master Plan will involve movement of laboratory and classroom spaces,
but would not likely result in increases in use of chemicals. Increased enrollment may result in
some increased use of laboratory chemicals; however, emissions of TACs would be minor and
would not result in a significant impact.

6.0     GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE


6.1     Introduction to Global Climate Change Issues

Global Climate Change (GCC) refers to changes in average climatic conditions on Earth as a
whole, including temperature, wind patterns, precipitation and storms. Global temperatures are
moderated by naturally occurring atmospheric gases, including water vapor, carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which are known as greenhouse gases (GHGs).
These gases allow solar radiation (sunlight) into the Earth's atmosphere, but prevent radiative
heat from escaping, thus warming the Earth's atmosphere. Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere
are often called greenhouse gases, analogous to a greenhouse. GHGs are emitted by both natural
processes and human activities. The accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere regulates the
Earth's temperature. Without these natural GHGs, the Earth's temperature would be about 61º
Fahrenheit cooler (California Environmental Protection Agency 2006). Emissions from human
activities, such as electricity production and vehicle use, have elevated the concentration of these
gases in the atmosphere.


GHGs have been at the center of a widely contested political, economic, and scientific debate
surrounding GCC. Although the conceptual existence of GCC is generally accepted, the extent
to which GHGs contribute to it remains a source of debate. The State of California has been at
the forefront of developing solutions to address GCC. GCC refers to any significant change in
measures of climate, such as average temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns over a period of
time. GCC may result from natural factors, natural processes, and/or human activities that
change the composition of the atmosphere and alter the surface and features of land.


Global climate change attributable to anthropogenic (human) emissions of GHGs (mainly CO2,
CH4 and N2O) is currently one of the most important and widely debated scientific, economic
and political issues in the United States. Historical records indicate that global climate changes
have occurred in the past due to natural phenomena (such as during previous ice ages). Some
data indicate that the current global conditions differ from past climate changes in rate and
magnitude.

Air Quality Technical Report                        33                                       8/07/09

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel (Panel) on Climate Change constructed several
emission trajectories of GHGs needed to stabilize global temperatures and climate change
impacts. The Panel concluded that a stabilization of GHGs at 400 to 450 ppm CO2 equivalent
concentration is required to keep global mean warming below 35.6º Fahrenheit (2º Celsius),
which is assumed to be necessary to avoid dangerous climate change (Association of
Environmental Professionals 2007).


State law defines greenhouse gases as any of the following compounds: carbon dioxide (CO2),
methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and
sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) (California Health and Safety Code Section 38505(g).) CO2, followed
by CH4 and N2O, are the most common GHGs that result from human activity.


6.2     Sources and Global Warming Potentials of GHG

The State of California GHG Inventory performed by the California Air Resources Board
(ARB), compiled statewide anthropogenic GHG emissions and sinks. It includes estimates for
CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs, and PFCs. The current inventory covers the years 1990 to 2004, and
is summarized in Table 6-1.      Data sources used to calculate this GHG inventory include
California and federal agencies, international organizations, and industry associations.     The
calculation methodologies are consistent with guidance from the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). The 1990 emissions level is the sum total of sources and sinks from all
sectors and categories in the inventory. The inventory is divided into seven broad sectors and
categories in the inventory.    These sectors include:     Agriculture; Commercial; Electricity
Generation; Forestry; Industrial; Residential; and Transportation.

When accounting for GHGs, all types of GHG emissions are expressed in terms of CO2
equivalents (CO2e) and are typically quantified in metric tons (MT) or millions of metric tons
(MMT).


GHGs have varying global warming potential (GWP). The GWP is the potential of a gas or
aerosol to trap heat in the atmosphere; it is the "cumulative radiative forcing effect of a gas over
a specified time horizon resulting from the emission of a unit mass of gas relative to a reference
gas" (USEPA 2006). The reference gas for GWP is CO2; therefore, CO2 has a GWP of 1. The
other main greenhouse gases that have been attributed to human activity include CH4, which has
a GWP of 21, and N2O, which has a GWP of 310. Table 6-2 presents the GWP and atmospheric
lifetimes of common GHGs.

Human-caused sources of CO2 include combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas, gasoline
and wood). Data from ice cores indicate that CO2 concentrations remained steady prior to the
current period for approximately 10,000 years. Concentrations of CO2 have increased in the
atmosphere since the industrial revolution.


CH4 is the main component of natural gas and also arises naturally from anaerobic decay of
organic matter. Human-caused sources of natural gas include landfills, fermentation of manure
and cattle farming. Human-caused sources of N2O include combustion of fossil fuels and
industrial processes such as nylon production and production of nitric acid.


Other GHGs are present in trace amounts in the atmosphere and are generated from various
industrial or other uses.


The sources of GHG emissions, GWP, and atmospheric lifetime of GHGs are all important
variables to be considered in the process of calculating CO2e for discretionary land use projects
that require a climate change analysis.


6.3     Regulatory Framework

All levels of government have some responsibility for the protection of air quality, and each level
(Federal, State, and regional/local) has specific responsibilities relating to air quality regulation.
GHG emissions and the regulation of GHGs is a relatively new component of air quality.

6.3.1   National and International Efforts

International and Federal legislation have been enacted to deal with GCC issues. In 1988, the
United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization established the IPCC to assess the
scientific, technical, and socioeconomic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis
for human-induced climate change, its potential impacts, and options for adaptation and
mitigation. The most recent reports of the IPCC have emphasized the scientific consensus that
real and measurable changes to the climate are occurring, that they are caused by human activity,
and that significant adverse impacts on the environment, the economy, and human health and
welfare are unavoidable.

In October 1993, President Clinton announced his Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), which
had a goal of returning GHG emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. This was to be
accomplished through 50 initiatives that relied on innovative voluntary partnerships between the
private sector and government aimed at producing cost-effective reductions in GHG emissions.
On March 21, 1994, the United States joined a number of countries around the world in signing
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).                     Under the
Convention, governments agreed to gather and share information on GHG emissions, national
policies, and best practices; launch national strategies for addressing GHG emissions and
adapting to expected impacts, including the provision of financial and technological support to
developing countries; and cooperate in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of GCC.
Recently, the United States Supreme Court declared in the court case of Massachusetts et al. vs.
the Environmental Protection Agency et al., 549 C.S. 497 (2007) that the EPA does have the
ability to regulate GHG emissions. In addition to the national and international efforts described
above, many local jurisdictions have adopted climate change policies and programs.


Proposed Endangerment Finding. On April 17, 2009, EPA issued its proposed endangerment
finding for GHG emissions. EPA is proposing to find that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations. Concentrations of
greenhouse gases are at unprecedented levels compared to the recent and distant past. EPA has
stated that these high atmospheric levels are the unambiguous result of human emissions, and are
very likely the cause of the observed increase in average temperatures and other climatic

changes. The effects of climate change observed to date and projected to occur in the future ­
including but not limited to the increased likelihood of more frequent and intense heat waves,
more wildfires, degraded air quality, more heavy downpours and flooding, increased drought,
greater sea level rise, more intense storms, harm to water resources, harm to agriculture, and
harm to wildlife and ecosystems ­ are effects on public health and welfare within the meaning of
the Clean Air Act.


Proposed Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule. On March 10, 2009, in response to the FY2008
Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 2764; Public Law 110­161), EPA proposed a rule that
requires mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from large sources in the
United States. The proposed rule would collect accurate and comprehensive emissions data to
inform future policy decisions.


EPA is proposing that suppliers of fossil fuels or industrial greenhouse gases, manufacturers of
vehicles and engines, and facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more per year of GHG
emissions submit annual reports to EPA. The gases covered by the proposed rule are carbon
dioxide    (CO2),    methane      (CH4),   nitrous   oxide   (N2O),   hydrofluorocarbons   (HFC),
perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and other fluorinated gases including nitrogen
trifluoride (NF3) and hydrofluorinated ethers (HFE).


Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards. The federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy
(CAFE) standard determines the fuel efficiency of certain vehicle classes in the United States. In
2007, as part of the Energy and Security Act of 2007, CAFE standards were increased for new
light-duty vehicles to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. In May 2009, President Obama announced
plans to increase CAFE standards to require light-duty vehicles to meet an average fuel economy
of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016.

6.3.2   State Regulations and Standards

The following subsections describe regulations and standards that have been adopted by the State
of California to address GCC issues.

Assembly Bill 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. In September 2006,
Governor Schwartzenegger signed California AB 32, the global warming bill, into law. AB 32
directs the ARB to do the following:


    ·   Make publicly available a list of discrete early action GHG emission reduction measures
        that can be implemented prior to the adoption of the statewide GHG limit and the
        measures required to achieve compliance with the statewide limit.
    ·   Make publicly available a GHG inventory for the year 1990 and determine target levels
        for 2020.
    ·   On or before January 1, 2010, adopt regulations to implement the early action GHG
        emission reduction measures.
    ·   On or before January 1, 2011, adopt quantifiable, verifiable, and enforceable emission
        reduction measures by regulation that will achieve the statewide GHG emissions limit by
        2020, to become operative on January 1, 2012, at the latest. The emission reduction
        measures may include direct emission reduction measures, alternative compliance
        mechanisms, and potential monetary and non-monetary incentives that reduce GHG
        emissions from any sources or categories of sources that ARB finds necessary to achieve
        the statewide GHG emissions limit.
    ·   Monitor compliance with and enforce any emission reduction measure adopted pursuant
        to AB 32.


AB 32 required that by January 1, 2008, ARB determine what the statewide GHG emissions
level was in 1990, and approve a statewide GHG emissions limit that is equivalent to that level,
to be achieved by 2020. ARB adopted its Scoping Plan in December 2008, which provided
estimates of the 1990 GHG emissions level and identified sectors for the reduction of GHG
emissions. The ARB has estimated that the 1990 GHG emissions level was 427 MMT net CO2e
(ARB 2008). The ARB estimates that a reduction of 173 MMT net CO2e emissions below

business-as-usual would be required by 2020 to meet the 1990 levels (ARB 2008). This amounts
to a 15 percent reduction from today's levels, and a 30 percent reduction from projected
business-as-usual levels in 2020 (ARB 2008).


Senate Bill 97. Senate Bill 97, enacted in 2007, amends the CEQA statute to clearly establish
that GHG emissions and the effects of GHG emissions are appropriate subjects for CEQA
analysis. It directs OPR to develop draft CEQA guidelines "for the mitigation of greenhouse gas
emissions or the effects of greenhouse gas emissions" by July 1, 2009 and directs the Resources
Agency to certify and adopt the CEQA guidelines by January 1, 2010.


The Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR) published a technical advisory on
CEQA and Climate Change on June 19, 2008. The guidance did not include a suggested
threshold, but stated that the OPR has asked CARB to, "recommend a method for setting
thresholds which will encourage consistency and uniformity in the CEQA analysis of greenhouse
gas emissions throughout the state." The OPR does recommend that CEQA analyses include the
following components:


    ·   Identify greenhouse gas emissions
    ·   Determine Significance
    ·   Mitigate Impacts


In April, the OPR published its proposed revisions to CEQA to address GHG emissions. The
amendments to CEQA indicate the following:

    ·   Climate action plans and other greenhouse gas reduction plans can be used to determine
        whether a project has significant impacts, based upon its compliance with the plan.
    ·   Local governments are encouraged to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions of proposed
        projects, noting that they have the freedom to select the models and methodologies that
        best meet their needs and circumstances. The section also recommends consideration of
        several qualitative factors that may be used in the determination of significance, such as
        the extent to which the given project complies with state, regional, or local GHG
        reduction plans and policies. OPR does not set or dictate specific thresholds of
        significance. Consistent with existing CEQA Guidelines, OPR encourages local
        governments to develop and publish their own thresholds of significance for GHG
        impacts assessment.

Master Plan
    ·   When creating their own thresholds of significance, local governments may consider the
        thresholds of significance adopted or recommended by other public agencies, or
        recommended by experts.
    ·   New amendments include guidelines for determining methods to mitigate the effects of
        greenhouse gas emissions in Appendix F of the CEQA Guidelines.
    ·   OPR is clear to state that "to qualify as mitigation, specific measures from an existing
        plan must be identified and incorporated into the project; general compliance with a plan,
        by itself, is not mitigation."
    ·   OPR's emphasizes the advantages of analyzing GHG impacts on an institutional,
        programmatic level. OPR therefore approves tiering of environmental analyses and
        highlights some benefits of such an approach.
    ·   Environmental impact reports (EIRs) must specifically consider a project's energy use
        and energy efficiency potential.



Executive Order S-3-05. Executive Order S-3-05, signed by Governor Schwartzenegger on
June 1, 2005, calls for a reduction in GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and for an 80
percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2050.          Executive Order S-3-05 also calls for the
California EPA (CalEPA) to prepare biennial science reports on the potential impact of
continued GCC on certain sectors of the California economy. The first of these reports, "Our
Changing Climate: Assessing Risks to California", and its supporting document "Scenarios of
Climate Change in California: An Overview" were published by the California Climate Change
Center in 2006.


California Code of Regulations Title 24.          Although not originally intended to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, California Code of Regulations Title 24 Part 6: California's Energy
Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings were first established in 1978
in response to a legislative mandate to reduce California's energy consumption. The standards
are updated periodically to allow consideration and possible incorporation of new energy
efficiency technologies and methods. The GHG emission inventory was based on Title 24
standards as of October 2005; however, Title 24 has been updated as of 2008 and standards are
set to be phased in in summer 2009. Energy efficient buildings require less electricity, natural
gas, and other fuels. Electricity production from fossil fuels and on-site fuel combustion
(typically for water heating) results in greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, increased energy
efficiency results in decreased greenhouse gas emissions.

State Standards Addressing Vehicular Emissions. California Assembly Bill 1493 (Pavley)
enacted on July 22, 2002, required the ARB to develop and adopt regulations that reduce
greenhouse gases emitted by passenger vehicles and light duty trucks. Regulations adopted by
ARB would apply to 2009 and later model year vehicles. ARB estimated that the regulation
would reduce climate change emissions from light duty passenger vehicle fleet by an estimated
18% in 2020 and by 27% in 2030 (AEP 2007). In 2005, the ARB requested a waiver from EPA
to enforce the regulation, as required under the Clean Air Act. Despite the fact that no waiver
had ever been denied over a 40-year-period, the then Administrator of the EPA sent Governor
Schwarzenegger a letter in December, 2007, indicating he had denied the waiver. On March 6,
2008 the waiver denial was formally issued in the Federal Register. Governor Schwarzenegger
and several other states immediately filed suit against the federal government to reverse that
decision. On January 21, 2009, ARB requested that EPA reconsider denial of the waiver. EPA
scheduled a re-hearing on March 5, 2009 and is considering the case.


Executive Order S-01-07 was enacted by the Governor on January 18, 2007. Essentially, the
order mandates the following: 1) that a statewide goal be established to reduce the carbon
intensity of California's transportation fuels by at least 10 percent by 2020; and 2) that a Low
Carbon Fuel Standard ("LCFS") for transportation fuels be established for California. It is
assumed that the effects of the LCFS would be a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from fuel use
by 2020. On April 23, 2009, ARB adopted regulations to implement the LCFS.

Senate Bill 375. Senate Bill 375 requires that regions within the state which have a metropolitan
planning organization must adopt a sustainable communities strategy as part of their regional
transportation plans. The strategy must be designed to achieve certain goals for the reduction of
GHG emissions. The bill finds that GHG from autos and light trucks can be substantially
reduced by new vehicle technology, but even so "it will be necessary to achieve significant
additional greenhouse gas reductions from changed land use patterns and improved
transportation. Without improved land use and transportation policy, California will not be able
to achieve the goals of AB 32." SB 375 provides that new CEQA provisions be enacted to
"encourage developers to submit applications and local governments to make land use decisions
that will help the state achieve its goals under AB 32," and that "current planning models and

analytical techniques used for making transportation infrastructure decisions and for air quality
planning should be able to assess the effects of policy choices, such as residential development
patterns, expanded transit service and accessibility, the walkability of communities, and the use
of economic incentives and disincentives."


6.4     Global Climate Change Impacts

In this section, climate change effects of the proposed project are addressed in two contexts:

1)      How does the project affect climate change? This is done by use of forecasting,
        preparing an emissions inventory for the project based on the project description and
        features incorporated in the project design.

2)      How does climate change affect the project? Due to the global nature of climate change,
        this cannot be forecast in a project-specific manner but potential effects of global change
        on factors such as wildfire hazard and water supply reliability are discussed in this
        section.


6.4.1   Existing Conditions


Background. SBVC is currently a source of GHG emissions. These emissions include indirect
emissions from energy use and water use, and direct emissions from natural gas combustion and
vehicles. In addition, the undeveloped portions of the site contains natural vegetation and soils.
Natural vegetation and soils temporarily store carbon as part of the terrestrial carbon cycle.
Carbon is assimilated into plants and animals as they grow and then dispersed back into the
environment when the die. There are two existing sources of carbon storage at the SBVC project
site: natural vegetation and soils.


Natural Vegetation. Living vegetation stores carbon; however, it is difficult to assess net
changes in carbon storage associated with the SBVC Master Plan. The key issue is the balance
between the loss of natural vegetation and future carbon storage associated with development.
For example, the project's landscaping palette will feature shrubs and trees which may provide
equal or greater carbon storage on a per acre basis. The situation is further complicated by
changes in fire regime. Carbon in natural vegetation is likely to be released into the atmosphere
Air Quality Technical Report                        43                                      8/07/09
San Bernardino Valley College
Master Plan
through wildfire every 20 to 150 years. Carbon in landscaped areas will be protected from
wildfire. The balance between these factors will influence the long-term carbon budget on the
site.


Soils. The majority of carbon within the site is stored in the soil. Soil carbon accumulates from
inputs of plant and animal matter, roots, and other living components of the soil ecosystem (e.g.,
bacteria, worms, etc.). Soil carbon is lost through biological respiration, erosion, and other forms
of disturbance. Overall, soil carbon moves more slowly through the carbon cycle, and it offers
greater potential for long-term carbon storage. Field observations suggest that urban soils can
sequester relatively large amounts of carbon. Observations from across the United States suggest
that cities in warmer and drier climates (such as San Bernardino County) may have slightly
higher soil organic matter levels when compared to equivalent areas before development.


6.4.2   Guidelines for the Determination of Significance

Since GCC is a global phenomenon, no direct impact would be identified for an individual land
development project. The following criterion is considered to establish a significance threshold
for GCC impacts:


    ·   The project will conflict with the goals and strategies of AB 32 to reduce GHGs to 1990
        levels by 2020.


According to the ARB's Scoping Plan, AB 32's goal of reducing GHGs to 1990 levels by 2020
would amount to a 30% reduction in emissions below "business as usual" levels, accounting for
growth in the state of California. "Business as usual" is defined as the emissions that would have
occurred in the absence of reductions mandated under AB 32. Based on the latest guidelines and
baseline emission calculations, for energy efficiency, "business as usual" is considered to be the
equivalent of being as energy efficient as Title 24 requires as of 2005. The potential for
significant impacts to global climate for the project were therefore evaluated on the basis of the
project's consistency with the goals of AB 32 to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020,


Air Quality Technical Report                        44                                       8/07/09

and to implement those programs that will be required under AB 32 that are applicable to the
SBVC Master Plan.


Global climate impacts are by nature cumulative; direct impacts cannot be evaluated because the
impacts themselves are global rather than localized impacts. The analysis therefore addresses
cumulative impacts.


6.4.3    Emissions Inventory

GHG emissions associated with Project construction were estimated using the URBEMIS Model,
Version 9.2.4, which estimates emissions of CO2. While the URBEMIS Model does not provides
estimates of N2O or CH4, emissions of these GHG would be much lower than emissions of CO2
and would not be anticipated to contribute substantially to emissions overall.


Construction Emissions. GHG emissions associated with Project construction were estimated
using the URBEMIS Model, Version 9.2.4, which estimates emissions of CO2. While the
URBEMIS Model does not provides estimates of N2O or CH4, emissions of these GHG would be
much lower than emissions of CO2 and would not be anticipated to contribute substantially to
emissions overall. Based on emission factors from the URBEMIS Model for heavy construction
equipment and on-road vehicles, total greenhouse gases associated with construction are
summarized in Table 6-3.

      GOVERNMENT CENTER CAMPUS
      MASTER PLAN / 2014




     GOAL
     The goal of this Master Plan assignment is to explore, outline and formalize a
     long-range strategy for the comprehensive development of the Government
     Center Campus of Dinwiddie County. The work is to examine the site for
     existing, proposed and future capacity, building arrangement, vehicular
     circulation and parking. Also, it is to evaluate the best design approach for
     utilities including water, sanitary sewer, electric, and data & communications
     services. Further, the plan will address environmental issues, site grading, site
     and storm water drainage, and future landscaping. The work will also layout
     preliminary schedules for implementing the proposed projects.

     All in all, the Master Plan should be an instructive document that sets out a long
     term guide for the phased and orderly development of the Government Center,
     so as to best meet the needs of the citizens of Dinwiddie for years to come.




     METHOD
     This Master Plan documentation is a descendant of information gained during
     the Dinwiddie County Government Center Study/ 2012, in which our team
     completed a 1-Facilities Survey and Evaluation, conducted a 2-Space Needs
     Assessment and prepared a series of 3- Master Plan Studies & Budget options

     Comprised of some six individual Site Plan drawings, the Master Plan describes
     the expansion of the current Dinwiddie County Government Center Campus to
     allow for three new buildings while certain current buildings are reassigned. In
     addition to the proposed expansion, the Master Plan also documents the
     potential for future expansion in the years ahead.

     COMMENTARY ON SITES

     Site 1 South West Wooded Site

     PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS
     Site 1 is property currently owned by the County, located to the southwest of the Dinwiddie Courthouse and
     beyond the retention basin north of the Pamplin Building. This site is heavily wooded with a natural drainage
     swail crossing the site, parallel to the inner boundary. The existing contours are somewhat severe, fluctuating
     from 229 to 271, with a mean average of 255-260, at the probable building pad. The approach to this parcel
     would be a newly constructed roadway passing either through the existing storm retention basin, or through an
     existing easement. The new road would activate a 50 foot easement that follows the joint property lines in the
     rear of the Courthouse proper, traversing a distance of some 975' +/- from Courthouse Road.

     Development of this parcel is eventually possible, but various existing constraints lower its ranking to last of the
     three. Specifically those constraints are:
           ·    All new utilities would need to be extended from the existing water, sewer, storm drainage, electrical
                power, communications, and information technology systems. The capacities of these systems are
                not known at this time, and must be verified before extension.
           ·    The parcel is located away from the main campus. Any new structure placed there, without the
                accompaniment of other structures, would be situated in a somewhat remote location.

     In critiquing this parcel, we do not want to downplay its long term value to the County. Sometime in the future, it
     could be extended and coupled with the timely acquisitions of the several other residential parcels directly
     behind the Courthouse. It is important to note that any acquisition of the residential parcels once combined with
     the main campus would create long term expansion possibilities not now present; and heighten security for the
     Government Center in general.

     If and when any of these three residential parcels to the west, should become available, in a fair market
     environment, it is suggested that the County consider purchase as a strategic option.



     CURRENT OBSERVATIONS

     Potential:                         Provides a single-story footprint of 24,000 s.f. based on a
                                        parking capacity of 80 vehicles.

     Need/Use:                          There is no current pressing need for the development of
                                        Site 1, in that current projected space needs can be met
                                        at Site 2 and Site 3, on a more efficient and economical
                                        basis.

     Conclusion:                        Site 1 should be reserved for future growth/expansion
                                        once the infrastructure and buildable areas of Site 2 and
                                        Site 3 are maximized.

     Site 2 North West Wooded Site

     PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS

     Site 2 is wooded property, currently owned by the County and is well situated adjoining the Courthouse to the
     North. Also, it has direct access to Courthouse Road, and a fifty foot (50') wide jointly held roadway easement
     that follows along the North boundary.

     Access to this particular site can be by way of the Courthouse parking lot, or from Courthouse Road proper. It
     can also be accessed from a section of the proposed new roadway / easement, noted above.

     This feature of being more accessible, and having direct highway access, is a bonus that Site 1 does not have.
     The advantage of location near the Courthouse, and easy accessibility to other facilities would prove to be a
     significant aid to the overall campus security program.

     Topographically Site 2 has much gentler and workable terrain than Site 1, and appears to contain no significant
     storm drainage issues. Also, the extension of infrastructure such as water, sewer, electric power, telephone, IT,
     and storm drainage, would require a shorter route than Site 1. This alone will lower overall development costs
     as compared to the first.

     This parcel, being in good proximity to the Courthouse is particularly well suited as the location for a proposed
     new Public Safety Building. Said structure would then combine the Sheriff's Office, Fire & EMS offices, as well
     as the E.O.C. Suite. The parcel is on high ground and provides good visibility not only of the Courthouse
     Grounds, but also the balance of the Campus, including the positive effects of a "security triangulation", offered
     in the security consultant's recommendations.



     CURRENT OBSERVATIONS

     Potential:                         Provides a single-story footprint of 22,000 s.f. and a parking
                                        capacity of 74 vehicles. Proximity to the Courthouse and
                                        Highway gives this site optimal ranking for near-term.

     Need/Use:                          There is current need for a new Public Safety Building of
                                        15,400 s.f. +/- and 51 parking spaces, all of which can be
                                        met at this site. The site is ideally suited for such use, in
                                        that the Sheriff's Office can be placed adjacent to the
                                        Courthouse, and, in a strategic oversight view of the
                                        campus.

     Conclusion:                        Site 2 should be reserved for the near-term development
                                        for a new Public Safety facility that will house the Sheriff's
                                        Office and the Fire/ EMS department; each
                                        complemented with common/ shared space.

     Site 3 Central Campus Site

     PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS

     Generally, Site 3 is that specific parcel of County owned property at the front section of the Government Center
     Campus, fronting along Boydton Plank Road. It is presently occupied by the old Social Services Building and
     the Health Department Building, and other incidental infrastructure.

     Currently, it is bisected by a central Roadway that takes traffic directly into the Courthouse, and has been
     identified as a vulnerable security risk by both this office, and the security consultant for the County.

     The site is fairly level along the higher mid-section, falling off some 10' to 12' towards the Courthouse parking
     lot to the west. Properly addressed, this natural grade condition, could allow for an exposed lower level (English
     Basement) along the western elevation of any new structure designed for this site.

     Site 3 is highly desirable from the vantage points of public access, and civic presence; and because of its size
     and location it could be successfully redeveloped as a "flagship" location for primary County Administration
     functions, and possibly others.

     This parcel is not without constraints; none however that cannot be resolved with careful planning. First, the
     decommissioning of the old Social Services Building and the Health Department would need to take place.
     Following that, critical infrastructure now serving those buildings would need to be cut, capped, and generally
     reworked so as to allow for future construction. Additionally, areas of the existing roadway and parking would
     need to be reworked / rearranged / expanded to accommodate any new development.

     All in all this is an optimal site, The boundary along the street is graced with many mature trees, and its visibility
     to the community is excellent.



     CURRENT OBSERVATIONS

     Potential:                          Provides a single-story footprint of 39,200 s.f. +/- and with
                                         parking capacity of 180 vehicles; can ultimately provide a
                                         multi-story capacity of 54,000 s.f. which can be met in
                                         variable building configurations and level arrangements.
                                         This is a highly visible site at the front of the campus with
                                         existing infrastructure.

     Need/Use:                           There is current need for both a new Human Services
                                         Facility of some 19,100 s.f. and 64 parking spaces; as well
                                         as a new Administration Facility of some 25,400 s.f. and
                                         85 parking spaces.

     Conclusion:                         Site 3 should be reserved for the near-term development
                                         of both a Human Services Facility of 19,100 s.f. and 64
                                         parking spaces, as well as an Administration Facility of
                                         25,400 s.f. and 85 parking spaces. Since it has a prominent
                                         location, this site would provide the best location for both of
                                         these frequently visited facilities, access to Boydton Plank
                                         Road is excellent.

     Summary/ Original

     In that there is limited space available for building expansion on either side and rear of the present Courthouse;
     and limited space available for a modest addition to the west of the Pamplin Building; we turn to the three
     primary "new building" sites available, within the present campus.

     The possibility for additional building sites beyond the three noted, would lie in the acquisition of several
     residential parcels to the west beyond the Courthouse, and the service station lot at the North East corner. Both
     of these options are not feasible at this time.

     Should the service station parcel ever become available a relocation and realignment of Courthouse Road, as it
     intersects with Boydton Plank Road, would allow the Main Campus to be expanded effectively and bring to it
     added beauty, security, and spatial continuity.


     Summary/ Update

     Overall, Site 1 should be reserved for future growth/ expansion once the infrastructure
     and buildable areas of Site 2 and Site 3 are completed. Site #2 should be reserved for
     the near term development of a new Public Safety Building that will house the Sheriff's
     Department and the Fire/ EMS Department. Site 3 ­ Central Campus, should be
     reserved for the near term development of both a Human Services Facility as well as
     an Administration Facility.

     FUTURE BUILDING PROJECTS

     Priority 1   HUMAN SERVICES FACILITY
                  SCOPE
                  Provide a new facility to house the Department of Social
                  Services,
                  Services Health Department and the Department of
                  Comprehensive Services,
                                  Services together, in an enlarged / enhanced
                  space as outlined in the Space Needs / Task II of the Dinwiddie
                  County Government Center Study / 2012.

                  Social Services                            10,817 sf

                  NEW CONSTRUCTION OPTION
                  This budget addresses building an all new facility, at a suitable
                  site, within the Government Center as either a stand alone
                  building or as an attached wing to a primary building. All
                  budget figures are pre-design.

                  BUDGET APPROACH

                  Site Work
                      Use: 19,100 sf x $10.00 psf =          $191,000

     Priority 1   ARCHITECTS DETERMINATION
                  While the needs of the Human Services at 19,100 sf +/- can be
                  fitted into the Pamplin Building of 25,888 sf +/-, the logistics
                  of doing so are complex and dependent on the relocation of
                  the present occupants, followed by a significant renovation.
                  Until such time as the Administration might be re-located, the
                  development of a Human Services Facility would be
                  unnecessarily delayed.

                  In that Human Services is the top ranking priority for
                  enhancement; new construction is the most appropriate option,
                  leaving the Pamplin Building in continued use for the short
                  term. This would allow allocation of its space for re-use by the
                  School Board at a later date, with minimum disruption to the
                  affected departments.

     Priority 2   PUBLIC SAFETY BUILDING
                  SCOPE
                  Provide a new or existing / renovated facility to house both the
                  Sheriff's Office and the Fire and EMS in an enlarged / enhanced
                  office space to include a new and jointly managed Emergency
                  Operations Center (EOC).

                  NEW CONSTRUCTION OPTION
                  Evaluate building at all new public safety facility at the
                  Government Center near / adjacent to the Courthouse, with
                  highway access, and adequate parking. This would be a stand
                  alone building, but also in good proximity to the Administration
                  for times of distress, when the E.O.C. Is in full operation.

                  BUDGET APPROACH

     Priority 2   ARCHITECTS DETERMINATION
                  While the needs of Public Safety at 15,400 sf +/- can be fitted
                  to the existing Pamplin Building of 25,888 sf+/-, the logistics of
                  doing so, are complex and dependent on the relocation of the
                  present occupants, followed by a significant renovation / re-fit.
                  Until such time that the Administration might be re-located, the
                  development of a Public Services Facility would be delayed.
                  Additionally, the vehicular traffic, street access, and parking
                  are problematic at the Pamplin Site.

                  In that Public Services is the number 2 priority needing
                  enhancement; new construction option is the more appropriate
                  approach, leaving the Pamplin Building in continued use short

                  a later date.

                  The Government Center Campus does have one unoccupied
                  site that meets the requirements of being on the highway and
                  being adjacent to the Courthouse. This is Site 2,

                  SCOPE
                  Provide a new or existing / renovated facility to house various

                  enlarged / enhanced office space to include, but not be limited
                  to the following:

                  I.T. (Information Technology) may be removed from this priority
                  should the decision be made to retain them in the Pamplin
                  Building or relocate them to the Fire/ EMS Building at a later

                  NEW CONSTRUCTION OPTION
                  This option evaluates an all new Administrative Facility at the
                  Government Center on a site to be selected / developed with
                  good visibility, good highway access and well planned and
                  adequate parking. This would be a stand alone building that is
                  sited / constructed such that future expansion is easily
                  achieved. The design of such a facility should plan for both
                  today's needs and future expansion.

                  BUDGET APPROACH

                  Site Work
                      Use: 25,200 sf x $15.00 psf =           $378,000

                            USE: $4,610,000 / $183.00 psf




     Priority 3   ARCHITECTS DETERMINATION
                  The new construction approach would provide advantages that
                  include only one move for Administration, but also place them
                  in all new offices that can better address the present space
                  needs, and those of the future. Placing the Administration
                  offices in a new facility sited at a central and key location, will
                  serve the public well. It would also help to optimize the
                  Masterplan concept now being considered in this study.

                  We find Site 3 to be the highly preferred location. The need to
                  decommission the existing Social Services and Health
                  Department buildings will come into play, as this site is
                  developed.

                  SCOPE
                  Evaluate providing a new or existing renovated facility to house
                  the collective administrative offices of the Dinwiddie County
                  School Board.
                          Board At this time the School Board is somewhat
                  bifurcated with major offices at the Pamplin Building, and other
                  support offices off-site. This is not a desirable situation from an
                  administrative perspective.

                  RENOVATION OPTION
                  Develop a re-assignment of the first floor of the Pamplin
                  Building,
                  Building subject to the re-location of the Administration Suite.

                  Currently, the School Board Offices in the Lower Level are too
                  small and there is no expansion room. Presently, the School
                  Board uses approximately 4,800 sf +/- of the Lower Level. Their
                  space needs are set at 10,520 sf +/-, which can be satisfied on
                  the first floor of the Pamplin Building.

     Priority 4   ARCHITECTS DETERMINATION
                  New Construction is not considered in this priority in that
                  adequate space in existing buildings can be made available.
                  The two sites considered are the Pamplin Building and the
                  Annex Buildings A & B at the Middle School Complex.

                  Presently the School Board is located in the Pamplin Building
                  and has been for some time past. Of the two renovation sites
                  considered, the Pamplin Building is the better suited and as
                  such, proves to be the most cost effective option.

                  The annex site has the disadvantage of being an older
                  classroom building that will be more difficult to retro-fit. Also,
                  the Annex Buildings are more remote to the public, and
                  situated to the rear of the site, bringing into question, security
                  and accessibility.

                  The overall need of the Extension Services are fairly limited in
                  scope as compared to those of others. Specifically, their need
                  for an enlarged meeting room suited to education and special
                  activities is most important, but not critical time-wise.

                  In that the proposed demolition of the Old Jail can take place
                  near term, and a modest renovation of the existing Sheriff's
                  Office could provide a suitable home for Extension Services; it

                  is suggested that their re-location and enhancements wait until
                  the Public Safety facility is completed, and the existing Sheriff's
                  Office is free for reassignment.

                  A new construction option was not considered for Extension

     SOLUTION A - SUMMARY
     Step 1 Human Services Facility




                                         Site 3

     The County can/ will address the needs for a Human Services Facility first, by
     building an all new combined structure at Site 3 to sufficiently accommodate
     Social Services, Health Department and Comprehensive Services. This facility
     would accent individual suite identities; all with preferred adjacencies, and at the
     same time provide good public access and parking.

     This new facility could be either a stand alone structure near the proposed
     Administration Building, or it could be connected as a wing of that (anticipated)
     larger Administration structure. In either case it is suggested that it's placement
     be in concert with the master planning, and building design guidelines
     envisioned for the overall campus and provided herein.

     By taking Human Services first, the County can limit the time at the current "off-
     site" temporary location of Health and Social Services at the Middle School.
     Their near term relocation will free the Middle School site for reassignment to its
     original education purposes.

     Step 2 Public Safety Building




                                                           Site 2

     The County can/ will address the needs for public safety, with an all new
     combined facility at Site 2 to house Sheriff, Fire & Emergency Medcial Services
     (EMS) in a single state-of-the-arts structure that will also house an updated
     Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to be used by both, and the County staff
     in times of disaster.

     The first choice of location for the facility is Site 2, the benefits of which have
     been outlined elsewhere in this report. The second choice of location would be
     for the Public Safety facility to be built at Site 3, possibly as an adjacent
     structure, or as a compatible wing of the (anticipated) new Administration
     facility. See below.

     The need of overall campus security and accessibility, places Site 2 as the
     preferred location for a new Public Safety Facility. The capacity of Site 2 fits
     nicely with the needs of the proposed Public Safety Facility.

     Step 3 County Administration




                                                    Site 3

     The County can/ will address the needs of County Administration by providing
     an all new facility to house the ten (10) selected departments as the center
     piece for Site 3, thus becoming the "flagship" building of the County.

     Possibly, this facility's construction will become a second step of a two-step
     effort wherein the Human Services Facility is brought online first, and the
     Administrative offices are then followed as funding permits.

     If it should be determined by the leadership to bring Public Safety to Site 3,
     rather than Site 1, this would alter the sequence by becoming the second step;
     thus pushing Administration offices to the third and final Step,
     as funding permits.

     While this facility may well come to be the second or third phase in the overall
     building exercise at Site 3; ultimately the three phases should combine into a
     complete and unified design as a single complex.

     Step 4 School Board




                       Site 3

     The County may address the needs of Dinwiddie School Board Offices with a
     relocation / reassignment of their "combined offices" into the first floor of the
     Pamplin Building, once it has been vacated by the Administration and modestly
     refurbished to meet their needs. Also, a portion of the Lower Level (Old School
     Board Offices) would be refurbished for the Department of Information
     Technology (I.T.), thereby releasing the existing trailers and eliminating all "rent"
     cost in the future.

                                        Scope: 11,600 SF


     Step 5 Extension Services

     In parallel with Step 4, address the needs of the Extension Services by
     relocating them to the Old Sheriff's Offices behind the Historic Courthouse once
     the Old Jail has been removed, the Sheriff's Offices relocated, and moderate
     refurbishments made.

     This site will afford the Extension Services a place of relative autonomy and a
     zone of adaptable and usable outdoor space, all to better serve their special
     requirements and clients needs.

     SOLUTION B - SUMMARY
     Step 1 Administration / Human Services / Public Safety




                      Site 3                             Site 2

     The County can/ will address the needs of Human Services, Public Safety and
     Administration in an all new County Facility at Site 3, as opposed to the first
     three steps shown in Solution A. As envisioned, this facility would provide
     collectively for the space and growth requirements of these three groupings, all
     in a singular
     cohesive effort.

     Conceptually, a facility of this nature is envisioned as having a strong central
     element housing the 10 core Administrative Offices of some 25,200 sf; and
     accompanied by two major flanking wings, one to house Human Services at
     approximately 19,100 sf, and another to house Public Safety at approximately
     15,100 sf, for a total of 59,400 sf overall.

     While this would be a more aggressive approach than the sequenced steps
     outlined in Solution A, it would, in one comprehensive step, resolve all of the
     various space deficiencies and growth requirements for the greater majority of
     departments. School Board, IT and Extensions Services would not be part of
     this, and are addressed next in Step 2.

     of the School Board by relocating / expanding within the existing Pamplin
     Building, once the Administration offices are relocated.

     Also, address the needs the needs of IT in parallel and following the School
     Board relocation by refurbishing a section of the lower level of the Pamplin
     Building as their permanent placement.

             Statement:
             As presently prepared for Master Plan/ 2014, budget figures summarized
             here are shown as Pre-Design figures associated with standard new
             construction or renovation projects. The project model assumes a
             Design/ Bid/ Build approach in an open market environment.

             These figures generally include: a.) Sitework ­ to include grading, paving,
             curbs & gutters, etc. associated directly with the project; b.) Building-
             Construction ­ to include general building costs associated with the
             Contract for Construction along with finishes, flooring and casework; and
             related c.) Other Costs ­ to include architectural/ engineering design, legal
             work, survey, testing, printing and other miscellaneous costs.

             Figures are drawn/ compiled from a history of other similar projects
             within the region. Figures are subject to variation and development of the
             design.

             Figures do not include Owner provided features such as furnishings and
             equipment, communication systems, information technology, security, or
             demolition of abandoned structures.

             In summary, the figures shown are limited to those generally associated
             with building costs of any given project, and are calculated in current
             dollars. An estimated inflation factor of 2% to 3% per year is to be
             anticipated for each year out that the project is extended.

     Part II­ Campus Utility Infrastructure &
              Design

              Statement:
              The budget numbers shown herein are for utility infrastructure
              improvements that are not typically associated with an individual
              building construction project.

              Budget numbers are included for a new private well and associated
              tanks and pumps to provide domestic service and fire service to the
              entire complex. New water main lines and fire hydrants are also
              included. Costs for individual domestic service and fire service lines,
              connections and meters are not included. Same shall be included in the
              individual building construction budgets.

              Likewise, budget numbers are included for new sanitary sewer main
              lines to serve the entire campus. Budget numbers are also included to
              upgrade the existing sewer pump station to accommodate all proposed
              development as shown on the master plan. However, costs for
              individual building sewer service lines and connections are not
              included.

              Budget numbers are included for BMP's and new storm sewer
              structures and piping to serve the entire campus. The subject storm
              sewer infrastructure shall capture runoff from the individual building
              sites and route same to central BMP facilities and down-gradient
              receiving channels. The costs for miscellaneous catch basins and
              piping around the building footprints are not included. Same shall be
              included in the individual building construction budgets.

              Last, budget numbers are included to provide a new fiber optic
              communication loop, with hand-holes, around the entire campus. The
              costs to make individual building connections are not included. Same
              shall be included in the individual building construction budgets.

1.0     PROJECT OVERVIEW
This technical memorandum summarizes the work effort undertaken by Engineering & Planning
Resources (EPR) for Jeff Robinson & Associates (Robinson) and Baxter Bailey & Associates
(Bailey) to evaluate the potential traffic impacts related to the future build-out of the Dinwiddie
County Government Center Master Plan.

This study is based on the conceptual plan developed by Bailey (provided in Appendix A ­ note
there are two conceptual plans, one that illustrates the land uses plus a revised concept
illustrating a revised entrance on Boydton Plank Road).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the intersection operations at four locations ­ three
existing Government Center access locations (two on Boydton Plank Road and one on
Courthouse Road) as well the intersection of Boydton Plank Road and Courthouse Road. Traffic
operations were analyzed for existing conditions, no-build conditions (as needed for the Boydton
Plank Road and Courthouse Road intersection), and a total build scenario.


2.0     EXISTING CONDITIONS ANALYSIS
The proposed Government Center complex is on the site of the current Government Center, in
the northwest quadrant of Boydton Plank Road and Courthouse Road. The immediate vicinity is
primarily characterized by office use and commercial development. In this area, both Boydton
Plank Road and Courthouse Road are two lane undivided roadways, although Boydton Plank
Road includes a two-way-left-turn-lane (TWLTL). The study area includes the three current
Government Center access locations and the Boydton Plank Road and Courthouse Road
intersection. The two existing access locations on Boydton Plank Road include an ingress only
location and an egress only location. The egress only location is at the Main Street intersection,
includes the TWLTL left turn lanes but no right turn lanes and is side-street STOP controlled.
Likewise, the ingress only location also includes the TWLTL left turn lane but no right turn lane
(technically no control as there is no egress movement at the intersection). The access location
on Courthouse Road is a full access location including access to the gas station across
Courthouse Road. There are no left turn lanes but there is a right turn lane to access the
Government Center and is side-street STOP controlled. The Boydton Plank Road and
Courthouse Road intersection is also side-street (Courthouse Road) STOP controlled and
includes a business access on the south side. There are mainline left turn lanes (the TWLTL),
but no exclusive right turn lanes (observations indicate there is a shoulder on the southwest
bound side of Boydton Plank Road that is utilized like a right turn lane but is not included in the
analysis).

Per the VDOT traffic count database, the traffic volumes along Boydton Plank Road are
relatively low and have decreased slightly over the last five years as well as over the last ten
years (see Table 1):

A vicinity map is provided in Figure 1.

Data Collection
Turning movement counts were conducted at the study intersections to establish existing traffic
operational conditions in the vicinity of the site. The counts were conducted on Tuesday and
Wednesday, December 3-4, 2-14. The counts were performed during the AM peak (7:00 AM ­
9:00 AM) and the PM peak (4:00PM ­ 6:00 PM). The existing volumes are illustrated in Figure
2 and the raw count data are provided in Technical Appendix B.

Traffic Analysis
The intersection capacity analyses were performed using Synchro 8 per the methodology
documented in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, Special Report
#209). Capacity analyses are utilized to determine a Level of Service (LOS) for a given
intersection operating under either signalized or unsignalized control. The LOS is based on
estimated delay and range from LOS A, the best, to LOS F, the worst. In general LOS A and
LOS B indicate little or no delay, LOS C indicates average delay, LOS D indicates delay is
increasing and noticeable, LOS E indicates the limit of acceptable delay and LOS F is
characteristic of over saturated conditions. The actual delays associated with these levels of
service are identified in Table 2.

The analyses indicate that the study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels of service
during both peak hours with all movements operating at LOS C or better.

The results are summarized in Table 3 and the HCM based Synchro worksheets are provided in
Technical Appendix C.


3.0      BACKGROUND TRAFFIC GROWTH
To evaluate the potential traffic impact of the Master Plan, a 20 year planning horizon was
evaluated. Based on the historic data illustrated in Table 1, there has been a small decrease in
traffic volumes over the last five years as well as the last ten years. However, for a conservative
analysis, a one percent per year background growth rate was assumed. The traffic volumes
associated with the 2033 background traffic are illustrated in Figure 3.


4.0     BUILD CONDITIONS ANALYSIS
This section documents the analyses performed to evaluate the probable traffic operations at the
study intersections assuming build-out of the Master Plan.

Master Plan ­ Site Land Use
The Master Plan provides a phased plan for development of the Government Center. The
following summarizes and describes the planned uses:

   1. Courthouse building to remain (40,214 square feet)
   2. Pamplin building to remain (25,400 square feet administrative office use)
   3. EMS building adjacent to Courthouse Road to remain
   4. Three new buildings proposed for administrative office use (50,000 square feet, 20,000
      square feet and 20,000 square feet)
   5. Current modular trailer uses will be moved into one of the three new buildings
         a. Social Services (8,000 square feet)
         b. Health Department (3,644 square feet)

The new buildings are proposed to total 90,000 square feet. However, 11,644 square feet of that
90,000 square foot total is already currently on the Government Center site utilizing modular
trailers. Therefore, the net result in additional square footage of office space is 78,356 square
feet.

Master Plan ­ Access
The Master Plan consolidates the two existing entrances on Boydton Plank Road into one access
location. The proposes location is in between the two existing access points, thus increasing the
spacing from the Boydton Plank Road and Courthouse Road intersection. The Master Plan also
includes a Courthouse Road access, but proposes to move the location to the northeast away
from Boydton Plank Road.

1. The Master Plan calls for the two Boydton Plank Road access locations to be consolidated into one access location.
2. Further testing conducted (No Build 2033 and Build 2033 Mitigated) for Boydton Plank and Courthouse since the LOS for the build scenario reduces to LOS E.
3. Proposed mitigation scenario for Courthouse Road is to add an exclusive right turn lane at the Boydton Plank intersection.
4. The Master Plan indicates this access will move to the north and will no longer intersect Courthouse Road at the Gas Station entrance. To be conservative, the analysis included
the Gas Station entrance to verify adequate operations if the access remained in the same location.
Trip Generation
The trip generation potential of the proposed development was determined using data published
in the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (9th Edition). The
basis utilized for calculating trips for the proposed development was the floor area in square feet
(78,356 square feet) using Land Use Code 733 ­ Government Office Complex. The resulting
number of trips estimated to be generated by the proposed Master Plan build-out is identified in
Table 4.

Traffic Distribution
The projected traffic volumes generated by the proposed development were assigned to the
immediate adjacent roadway network by examination of the existing traffic patterns in the study
area. The distribution percentages are illustrated in Figure 4, the resulting site trips are
illustrated in Figure 5 and the total build trips are illustrated in Figure 6.

Traffic Analysis
Intersection capacity analyses were conducted as previously described. The results are
summarized in Table 3, the build condition analysis summary worksheets are provided in
Appendix D, and the mitigated build condition analysis summary worksheets are provided in
Appendix E.

Government Center Access Location ­ Boydton Plank Road
The Master Plan consolidates the two existing entrances on Boydton Plank Road into one access
location. The proposes location is in between the two existing access points, thus increasing the
spacing from the Boydton Plank Road and Courthouse Road intersection. To provide a
conservative test (since the Master Plan is conceptual at this point), the analysis assumed that the
egress movement is only one shared lane, even though the Master Plan indicates sufficient width
for multiple egress lanes. All movements are projected to operate at LOS B or better during both
the AM and PM peak hours.

Government Center Access Location ­ Courthouse Road
The Master Plan proposes to move the existing Courthouse Road access location to the northeast
away from Boydton Plank Road. Like the analysis for the Boydton Plank Road access, this
analysis assumed that the egress movement is only one shared lane even though there appears to
be sufficient width for multiple egress lanes. In addition, even though the Courthouse Road
access is proposed to be shifted away from the current location at the Gas Station access, this
build analysis included the Gas Station access to test the highest possible intersection volume.


                                                                                                  7
All movements are projected to operate at LOS C or better during both the AM and PM peak
hours.

Boydton Plank Road and Courthouse Road Intersection
Given the build-out scenario, the Courthouse Road approach to this intersection is expected to
operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS D during the PM peak hour. All other
movements are projected to operate satisfactorily at LOS C or better during both peak periods.

Since traffic operations are projected to degrade to LOS E for the Courthouse Road approach,
additional analyses were conducted. A No-Build analysis was completed for the intersection to
determine if just the increase in background traffic results in a poor level of service. The No-
Build analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to work satisfactorily with all
movements operating at LOS D or better during both peak periods. Therefore, mitigation testing
was conducted to evaluate potential measures for improving the level of service to accommodate
the build related traffic. With the addition of an exclusive right turn lane on the Courthouse
Road approach, all movements are projected to operate at LOS D or better during both peak
hours.

Turn Lane Requirements - Government Center Access Locations
In addition to the study intersection capacity analysis, the two proposed site access locations
were evaluated per VDOT turn lane requirements. The turn lane worksheets are provided in
Appendix F.

Boydton Plank Road Access Location
At the proposed access location, Boydton Plank Road geometry currently includes a Two-Way-
Left-Turn-Lane (TWLTL). The right turn lane warrant analysis indicates that a full width right
turn storage lane and taper are warranted.

Courthouse Road Access Location
Per the VDOT turn lane warrants, a left turn lane is not warranted at this entrance. The right turn
lane warrant analysis indicates that a full taper is required but not a right turn storage lane.

Boydton Plank Road Access Management
The proposed Boydton Plank Road Government Center entrance consolidation improves the
access management in the corridor by reducing the number of entrances and increasing the
spacing from the Boydton Plank Road and Courthouse Road intersection. In addition, field
review indicates there are multiple commercial entrances (not related to the Government Center)
in the corridor that do not meet current access management guidelines and should be closed /
moved / consolidated as future developments and improvements occur in the corridor.




                                                                                                 8
5.0      SUMMARY

The following summarizes the analysis results:

      1. Boydton Plank Road Government Center Access
            a. The consolidation of the two existing access locations provides an access
               management improvement in the corridor.
            b. A full width right turn storage lane and taper are required.
            c. The intersection is expected to operate satisfactorily at full build-out.

      2. Courthouse Road Government Center Access
            a. Turn lanes are not required at this access location, although a full right turn taper
               is warranted.
            b. The intersection is expected to operate satisfactorily at full build-out.

      3. Boydton Plank Road and Courthouse Road Intersection
            a. The Courthouse Road approach is expected to operate at LOS E at full build-out
               given the current geometry.
            b. A full width right turn lane is required (from Courthouse Road onto Boydton
               Plank Road) to mitigate this level of service.

      4. Boydton Plank Road Corridor Access Management
            a. While the Government Center access consolidation improves access management
               in the corridor, there are multiple commercial entrances (not related to the
               Government Center) in the corridor that do not meet current access management
               guidelines and should be closed / moved / consolidated as future developments
               and improvements occur in the corridor.

 Warrants for Left Turn Storage Lanes on Two-Lane Highways

 Advancing volume and opposing volumes (VPH), speed and percent left turns are used
 to determine whether a left turn storage lane is warranted on two-lane highways.

 The warrants in table below are taken from the 2011 AASHTO "Green Book", Page 9-
 132, Table 9-23. They were derived from Highway Research Report No. 211, Figures 2
 through 19, for required storage length determinations.

 The No. 211 study was undertaken to provide consistent volume warrants for left-turn
 storage lanes at unsignalized intersections.

PUMP STATION EVALUATION

FINDINGS:

Information was gathered from various sources to understand the current make-up and
condition of the existing sanitary sewer pump station. Information was obtained from review
of the 1997 Courthouse plans and from various site visits and from an office visit with
Robert Wilson, the Director of the Dinwiddie Water Authority. Information gathered is as
follows:

·   Attach. #1:   Courthouse Plans, Part. Copy, Sheet C5.1, dated 10-22-96.
·   Attach. #2:   Water Meter Readings For Gov. Center Complex, 2008 To 2013.
·   Attach. #3:   Pump Station Runtime Graphs, 12-6-13 To 1-24-14.
·   Attach. #4:   Previous Pump Station Evaluation and Recommendations


RECOMMENDATIONS:

The pump station evaluation was based on a total building square footage figure =
150,000sf as shown on the Master Plan. An allowance of (1) person per 200 sf of building
area was used to determine future flow rates. This equates to a total future occupancy =
750 persons. Based on a usage rate = 25 gallons per day per person, this equates to a
total future usage = 18,750 gallons per day. Therefore, the existing pump station and 2"
force main were evaluated with a normal flow rate = 30 gallons per minute. This value is
based on a 10.5 hour work day.

Wood Equipment Service Company from Ashland, VA was consulted to help with the
technical evaluation and to provide budget pricing for the subject upgrade. Please see
Attachment #5 for Wood's complete report. A summary of their recommendations is as
follows:

·    Replace (2) existing 5 hp grinder pumps with (2) new 15 hp grinder pumps.
·    Replace existing internal piping with new stainless steel piping.
·    Replace the existing pump removal system with a new system in kind.
·    Replace / relocate check and gate valves to an external vault with locking cover.
·    Replace control panel, electrical, alarms, battery back-up, float controls, etc..

WELL CAPACITY STATUS / STUDY

FINDINGS:

Various sources were considered in an effort to determine the condition of the existing
domestic well. Mike Banta, the local Health Official, was able to provide me with the original
well permit. The permit is dated 9-18-72. The permit provided no well construction
information. The permit did show the estimated water consumption rate to be 450 gallons
per day. Please note that the highest usage during 2013 was 1,537 gallons per day. Please
note that the design usage rate at future build-out is 18,750 gallons per day. A copy of the
original permit is attached for reference. Same is marked as Attachment #1.

Another source of information was Ted Baxter of Gentry Well Works. I visited the site with
Mr. Baxter to get his opinion of the well and well house construction. Prior to our visit, Mr.
Baxter was not familiar with the existing well. Even so, Mr. Baxter quickly determined that
the current well construction was outdated technology.

Staff members were also a good source of information regarding the existing well. During
master plan meetings, I questioned staff from every building on the campus. I found the
general consensus to be unfavorable. Every person stated that the well water was not
suitable for consumption.

It is important to note that the existing well was constructed to provide domestic service
only. It is not feasible to improve the existing well to provide fire service, via sprinkler
systems and / or fire hydrants, for future buildings.

Last, it is also important to note that the location of the existing well, behind the old Health
Department Building, is in conflict with the proposed location of the new Administration
Building. The well and well house must be readily accessible for repairs and general
maintenance. It is not practical to design the new Administration Building "around" the
existing well facility.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

In consideration of the above findings, it is recommended that a new well facility be
constructed elsewhere on the site. It is also recommended that the new well be
constructed to provide fire service and domestic service to the entire campus. Several
individuals were consulted to develop recommendations and budget pricing regarding
same. They were, Robert Wilson, Dinwiddie Water Authority; Ted Baxter, Gentry Well
Works; Sam Carter, Peninsula Fire Protection and Todd Walker, Hydro Tec, Inc..

The quality and quantity of available water at the new well site is unknown and
unpredictable. The Courthouse building is also served by a private well. The new well site
shall be located about 200 feet south of the existing Courthouse well site. Therefore, the
existing Courthouse well was investigated for reference. Terry Dettmer, Office of Drinking
Water, Norfolk, provided me with the Engineering Description Sheet for the Courthouse
well. A copy of same is included and is marked as Attachment #2. I found that the
Courthouse well was constructed in 1996, is 345 feet deep and had a yield = 7.5 gallons
per minute at the time of installation. I found the well to provide partial fire protection for
the Courthouse Building via booster pumps and a 15,000 gallon underground storage
tank. I found, from staff interviews, that the Courthouse well water was also considered to
be unsuitable for consumption.

Therefore, we have guesstimated that the new campus well will be about 425 feet deep.
We are proposing that fire service be provided via a 250,000 gallon above ground storage
tank and diesel booster pumps. This will provide distribution for sprinkler systems in new
buildings and distribution for fire hydrants to protect existing un-sprinkled buildings. The
250,000 gallon tank is sized to provide 2,000 gallons per minute of fire flow to hydrants for
a 2 hour duration.

The installation for domestic service will be predicated by the actual yield of the well
construction. If a modest yield is achieved, 5 to 10 gallons per minute, a conventional well
pump, booster pump and large pressure tank will be installed. However, if a substantial
yield is achieved, 20 to 30 gallons per minute, a more efficient and economical variable
speed type well pump with small bladder tanks will be installed. A water conditioning
system is also recommended and is included in the budget numbers.

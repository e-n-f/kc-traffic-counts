1.0  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Purpose & Need Statement 
This study analyzes SR176 from Section 10.13 to 10.43.  This section of road appears on ODOT's 
2010  listing  of  high  crash  locations  (HSP  NonFreeway),  and  it  is  rated  #12  in  the  State.  The 
purpose  of  this  report  is  to  study  this  location  and  analyze  the  crashes  to  determine  what,  if 
any,  actions  can  be  taken  to  reduce  the  high  percentage  of  fixed  object  and  rearend  crashes 
that have occurred in the study area. 
 
Background 
This  0.30mile  section  of  SR176  is  located  in  the  cities  of  Cleveland  and  Parma  in  Cuyahoga 
County, Ohio. It is part of the urban state highway system under the jurisdiction of District 12 of 
the  Ohio  Department  of  Transportation  (ODOT).  The  section  under  study,  log  point  10.13  to 
10.43,  begins  at  the  intersection  of  SR176  and  Brookpark  Road  and  extends  in  a  north/north
easterly direction over I480 to just west of the overpass ramp from SR176 southbound to I480 
eastbound.  Based  on  information  supplied  by  District  12,  CUY176  (10.1310.43)  was  ranked 
#12 on the 2010 SafetyAnalyst list of top nonfreeway locations. 
 
Brief Overview of Possible Causes 
The safety problems identified at this location are as follows: 
     Visibility issues ­ most  of the study area crashes occurred at the SR176/Brookpark Road 
        intersection southbound right turn lane; the turn lane is at a 135° angle to the eastwest 
        traffic, which causes visibility issues.  
        Horizontal  curve  concerns  ­  there  are  number  of  crashes  with  in  the  study  area  at  or 
        approaching  the  curved  section  of  SR176,  indicating  motorists  are  not  negotiating  this 
        area safely. 
 
Recommended Countermeasures and Costs 
Recommended ShortTerm Countermeasures  
 Install  Impact  Attenuator  on  SR176  Median  Wall:  at  the  SR176/Brookpark  Road 
   intersection,  replace  the  tapered  portion  of  the  median  wall  on  SR176  closest  to  the 
   intersection  with  an  impact  attenuator.   Perform  this  activity  as  part  of  the  upcoming  NHS 
   barrier upgrade in FY2013. 
 Restripe  Brookpark  Road  Pavement  Markings:  Within  500'  of  the  SR176/Brookpark  Road 
   intersection,  restripe  the  pavement  markings  ­  especially  the  intersection  crosswalks.  (If 
   Brookpark  Road  will  be  repaved  in  the  near  future,  perform  this  recommendation  with  the 
   paving project to save time and money.) 
 Install  Curve  Warning  Signage  &  Rumble  Strips:  replace  the  two  existing  Tintersection 
   ahead  warning  signs  (R24)  with  signs  to  indicate  a  horizontal  curve  ahead  (R12L)  on  both 
   sides  on  SR176  in  advance  of  the  curve;  add  two  3'  groups  of  rumble  strips  on  the 
   southbound side in advance of the curve.

CUY17610.1310.43 
November 2012 
    Perform  Ball  Bank  Study:  perform  a  ball  bank  study  for  the  SR176  curve  to  determine  the 
    safe advisory speed for the curve. 
    Upgrade/Update Signals: on Brookpark Road, increase the 3.0 second yellow interval to 3.6 
    seconds;  and  on  SR176,  increase  the  yellow  interval  to  3.6  seconds.   Reduce  the  minimum 
    green  for  the  eastbound  leftturn  phase  from  10  seconds  to  7  seconds.    Replace  the 
    pedestrian  push  buttons  with  a  more  rugged  design.  Increase  the  "Flashing  Don't  Walk" 
    times  to  account  for  new  OMUTCD  standards.  After  replacing  the  pedestrian  push  buttons, 
    reduce  the minimum  green  for  the westbound  through  phase  (phase  2)  from  37  seconds  to 
    20  seconds  and  turn  off  the  Pedestrian  Recall  for  phase  2.   Upgrade  all  signal  heads  to  LED 
    with backplates with reflective strips where still needed. 
    SR176/I480  Interchange  Safety  Study:    perform  a  more  detailed  study  of  the  entire 
    SR176/I480  interchange  to  evaluate  crash  patterns  and  consider  possible  improvements  in 
    lane use to better handle traffic demand. 
    Remove  Driveway  Apron:  eliminate  unused  drive  apron  in  the  northeast  quadrant  of  the 
    SR176/Brookpark Road intersection along Brookpark Road.  
    Restripe  Center  Lane  for  TWLT:  east  of  the  Tintersection  along  Brookpark  Road  in  the 
    northeast  quadrant,  the  parcel  has  been  newly  developed.   As  a  result,  due  to  the  addition 
    of a new driveway for this parcel, the Brookpark Road center lane should be restriped in this 
    location  to  accommodate  a  twoway  left  turn  lane  for  this  driveway  access.  Combine  with 
    restriping Brookpark Road recommendation if possible to save money. 
     

The estimated cost of the shortterm improvements would be $58,200.  
 
Recommended MediumTerm Countermeasures 
 Straighten  SR176  Southbound  Right  Turn  Lane:  realign  the  SR176  southbound  right  turn 
   lane  to  make  it  perpendicular  to  Brookpark  Road  and  perform  the  necessary  modifications 
   to  the  edge  of  pavement,  curb,  and  sidewalk  for  this  realignment.  Consider  performing  this 
   recommendation in the upcoming paving project (PID: 89267). 
 Repave  Brookpark  Road:  Within  600'  of  the  SR176/Brookpark  Road  intersection,  repave 
   Brookpark Road. 
 

The  estimated  cost  of  for  the  mediumterm  improvements  would  be  $257,850.    The  rate  of 
return for these improvements would be 33.38%, with an average annual benefit of $78,900.  
 
Additional Possible Countermeasures 
The  countermeasures  recommended  in  the  shortterm  and  mediumterm  address  the  crash 
issues  identified  in  the  study  area,  so  no  longterm  countermeasures  are  recommended.  
However, if the aboveproposed countermeasures are implemented and a similar crash pattern 
continues, two additional options could be explored: 
    Restrict  the  southbound  right  turn  on  red:  Perform  an  origindestination  study  for  the 
    combined  SR176/Brookpark  Road  intersection  and  Brookpark  Road/Broadview  Road 
    intersection  area  to  determine  if  restricting  the  right  turn  on  red  at  the  SR176  southbound

    approach  is  feasible  for  the  travel  patterns.    If  feasible,  install  the  necessary  signage.  
    Continuous enforcement will be important. 
    Perform  an  additional  study  at  the  intersection:  evaluate  more  costly  options,  such  as  the 
    viability  of  vertically  and/or  horizontally  realigning  the  SR176  bridge  to  remove/reduce  the 
    curve and thus improve sight distances and safety. 
 
 
2.0  EXISTING CONDITIONS 
 
Condition Diagrams 
Please see Figures 1 ­ 4 for the Condition Diagrams. 
 
Physical Condition Writeup 
BPS  staff  conducted  a  field  review  on  March  28,  2012.    BPS  staff  observed  the  study  area 
section  and  collected  information  regarding  the  existing  conditions.   The  section  under  study, 
log point 10.13 to 10.43, begins at the intersection of SR176 and Brookpark Road and extends in 
a  north/northeasterly  direction  over  I480  to  just  west  of  the  overpass  ramp  from  SR176 
southbound  to  I480  eastbound.  This  northsouth  section  of  SR176  is  located  in  the  City  of 
Cleveland in Cuyahoga County.   
 
Roadway Details: The section of SR176 in the project area is a twolane, divided, limitedaccess 
urban  principal  arterial  (freeway/expressway).    The  southern  terminus  is  a  signalized  T
intersection  with  Brookpark  Road,  and  to  the  north  SR176  transitions  into  the  Jennings 
Freeway.    The  transition  experiences  both  vertical  and  horizontal  grade  changes  as  it  travels 
over  Norfolk  Southern  Railroad  and  I480.  The  study  area  is  functionally  a  ramp  connection 
between  Brookpark  Road  and  the  limited  access  portion  of  SR176  (aka  the  Jennings  Freeway). 
The  major  traffic  movement  occurs  between  the  I480  ramps  and  limited  access  portion  of  SR 
176. 

From  0  to  200  feet  north  of  the  Tintersection  with  Brookpark  Road  (from  SLM  10.13  to  10.17), 
SR176  is  a  threelane  divided  roadway  with  one  12foot  southbound  right  turn  lane,  one  11
foot  southbound  left  turn  lane,  and  one  14foot  northbound  through  lane.   There  is  a  median 
wall  separating  the  twoway  traffic  that  is  two  feet  high  for  the  first  50  feet  in  length  (south  to 
north) and then transitions to a 4foot high wall.  From SLM 10.1710.43, SR176 transitions to a 
twolane  divided  roadway.   There  is  one  14foot  northbound  lane  and  one  16foot  southbound 
lane.    There  is  a  median  wall  separating  the  twoway  traffic  that  is  4foot  high.    There  is  a 
horizontal  curve  along  SR176  on  structure  as  an  overpass  of  I480  and  the  Norfolk  Southern 
Railroad  tracks.   Outside  the  project  area  at SLM  10.49,  there  is  a  flashing  beacon  on  a  warning 
sign,  "Freeway  Ends,"  on  SR176  southbound  located  on  the  ramp  overpass  of  SR176 
southbound to I480 eastbound.

At  its  intersection  with  SR176,  Brookpark  Road  is  an  eastwest  roadway  signed  as  both  SR176 
and  SR17.   The  north  side  of  the  roadway  is  within  the  City  of  Cleveland;  the  south  side  of  the 
roadway  is  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  City  of  Parma.   The  section  of  Brookpark  Road  in  the 
project area is a fivelane urban principal arterial (other) with two 11foot through lanes in each 
direction and one 11foot dedicated left turn lane in the center.  This section of Brookpark Road 
is both straight and flat and is curbed.   
 
Traffic:  On  March  20,  2012,  traffic  counts  were  taken  at  the  SR176/Brookpark  Road 
intersection.   The  results  showed  that  the  peak  hour  for  the  intersection  was  at  4:30pm.   The 
peak  hour  volume  (PHV)  for  SR176  southbound  was  890  vehicles.  For  the  southbound  traffic, 
89% turned right and the remaining turned left onto Brookpark Road.  For Brookpark Road, the 
results showed that the eastbound PHV was 801 vehicles and westbound was 996 vehicles. 
 
Access:  SR176  is  a  limited  access  roadway  in  the  study  area,  so  it  does  not  contain  any  private 
access points; however, there are 20 private access points along Brookpark Road within 600' of 
the SR176/Brookpark Road Tintersection.  As a result, the access point density along Brookpark 
Road is one access point every 60'.   
 
Pavement  Condition:  The  pavement  along  SR176  is  in  good  condition  ­  no  noticeable  cracking 
or  potholes  were  observed;  however,  the  pavement  along  Brookpark  Road  near  the  SR176 
intersection  has  numerous  cracks,  some  potholes,  and  is  very  worn.   The  pavement  markings 
along  SR176  were  in  good  condition  ­  except  for  the  stopbar  and  eastwest  crosswalk  on  the 
north  side  of  the  Tintersection,  which  is  mostly  worn  away  on  the  northbound  side.    The 
pavement  markings  along  Brookpark  Road  were  faded,  and  the  northsouth  crosswalk  on  the 
east  side  of  the  intersection  was  completely  missing  its  northern  section  where  is  crosses  the 
westbound lanes.  
 
Signal:    The  signalized  intersection  of  SR176  and  Brookpark  Road  operates  as  an  isolated 
intersection  with  cycle  lengths  varying  from  72  to  100  seconds  depending  on  the  traffic 
demand.    The  traffic  signal  is  a  3phase  signal  with  an  eastbound  leftturn  and  a  southbound 
rightturn overlap.  The southbound rightturn arrow comes on during the southbound through 
phase (phase 3) and stays on through the eastbound leftturn phase.  If the eastbound leftturn 
phase  is  not  activated,  then  the  southbound  rightturn  arrow  terminates  with  the  southbound 
through phase.  The pedestrian crossings are restricted on the west side of the intersection, but 
they are permitted on the other two sides. The pedestrian crosswalk buttons appear to be non
functional, creating the need to operate the pedestrian movement on recall 24/7.   
 
Other  Features:  There  is  no  permitted  onstreet  parking  in  the  study  area.    Street  lighting  is 
present  along  Brookpark  Road  and  along  SR176  from  10.13  to  10.20.   A  bus  route  runs  along 
Brookpark  Road,  and  there  is  one  bus  stop  within  600'  of  the  SR176  intersection,  but  there  are 
no  bus  stops  on  SR176.   There  are  no  sidewalks  on  SR176,  but  there  are  sidewalks  along  both 
sides  of  Brookpark  Road.   A  large  tree  is  located  in  the  northwest  corner  of  the  Tintersection.

Currently,  it  does  not  appear  to  obstruct  visibility  but  if  it  does  in  the  future,  it  should  be 
trimmed or removed as needed. 
 
Land  Uses:  Development  is  restricted  along  SR176,  but  Brookpark  Road  is  lined  with 
commercial development on its north and south sides.  Singlefamily residential neighborhoods 
are located behind the commercial buildings along the south side of Brookpark Road.     
 
Field Observations: Some congestion along Brookpark Road was observed in the PM peak hour.  
Specifically,  vehicles  attempting  to  turn  left  out  of  BP  and  Burger  King  located  west  of  the 
SR176/Brookpark Road intersection along the north side of Brookpark Road.  In addition, it was 
observed  that  the  SR176  southbound  traffic  turning  right  (westbound)  onto  Brookpark  Road 
typically  `rolled'  through  the  red  light  when  making  the  movement  instead  of  making  a 
complete  stop.   A  local  resident  related  that  he  had  seen  many  near  misses  with  pedestrians 
attempting  to  cross  the  SR176  intersection  due  to  driver  speed,  vehicles  turning  right  on  red, 
and  running  red  lights.    He  said  that  motorists  demonstrate  a  general  lack  of  respect  for 
pedestrians in this location.  A sightdistance issue may be present along the SR176 overpass of 
I480 and the Norfolk Southern railroad track due to a horizontal curve being located just north 
of the SR176/Brookpark Road intersection. 
 
 
3.0  CRASH DATA 
A  total  of  75  crashes  over  the  threeyear  period  from  20082010  were  originally  logged  within 
the  study  area;  however,  after  reviewing  the  OH1  reports,  only  26  of  these  crashes  were 
actually located in the study area (between log points 10.13 and 10.43).  The remaining crashes 
were  mislogged  and  located  on  nearby  freeway  and  ramp  sections  or  near  the  Brookpark 
Road/Broadview  Road  intersection.    The  logging  errors  on  the  freeway/ramp  sections  were 
most  likely  due  to  mislogging  the  SLM  and  the  crash  category  (freeway  vs.  nonfreeway);  and 
the  logging  errors  at  the  Brookpark  Road/Broadview  Road  intersection  were  most  likely  due  to 
the  overlap  of  SR176  and  SR17  at  this  location  ­  there  is  an  "intersection"  of  these  two  signed 
routes at two locations nearby to each other.   
 
There was some difficulty in spatially locating crashes on ramps in the SR 176/I480 interchange 
area; therefore it is recommended that a future study of a  larger area encompassing the whole 
interchange be  performed  to  ensure  all  crashes  logged  to  SR  176  and  I480  are  evaluated  more 
thoroughly.  When  this  future  study  is  performed,  it  is  recommended  that  District  furnish 
additional  crash  data  for  the  entire  interchange  area  to  facilitate  a  meaningful  review  of  all 
crashes  that  may  be  attributed  to  interchange  areas,  especially  since  it  appears  with  the  crash 
data  available  for  this  study  that  the  SR176  southbound  ramps  to  I480  could  be  a  major 
concern.  As a result of the wide locational distribution of the crashes, the crash data and crash 
analysis  are grouped  by locations.   The  crash  summary  data  are  included  in  Appendix  A,  and  an 
overview is shown below:

4.0  CRASH ANALYSIS 
 
All Crashes 
Crash  reports  from  January  1,  2008  through  December  31,  2010  were  obtained.  During  this 
threeyear  period,  a  total  of  75  crashes  were  originally  logged  within  the  study  limits.    As 
mentioned above, only 26 of these crashes were actually located in the study area (between log 
points  10.13  and  10.43),  and  the  remaining  crashes  were  mislogged  and  located  on  nearby 
freeway  and  ramp  sections  or  near  the  Brookpark  Road/Broadview  Road  intersection.    Figures 
5  ­  7  include  the  crash  diagrams  which  show  the  approximate  locations  of  these  20082010 
crashes.    To  establish  possible  crash  patterns,  the  crashes  were  grouped  by  location,  as 
described below. 
 
Crashes Grouped by Location 
Broadview Road/Brookpark Road Intersection 
Crashes  outside  study  areas  so  were  not  analyzed  as  part  of  this  study.  (Figure  5  includes  the 
crash diagram which shows the approximate location of the 20082010 crashes in this location.) 
 
Study Area ­ Log Point 10.13 (SR176/Brookpark Road Intersection) to 10.43 
From  January  1,  2008  through  December  31,  2010,  a  total  of  26  crashes  occurred  within  the 
study limits. Of the 26 crashes, 14 were rearends (53.8%), seven were fixed object (26.9%), and 
three  were  sideswipe  passing  (11.5%),  comprising  92.3%  of  the  crashes.   Of  the  remaining  two 
crashes,  one  was  a  leftturn  and  one  involved  an  animal.   Nine  of  the  crashes  (34.6%)  involved 
an injury, but none were fatal. Most occurred during the day (76.9%), on dry roads (65.4%), and 
with no adverse weather conditions (80.8%). The crashes were spread throughout all months of 
the  year,  all  days  of  the  week  and  all  hours  of  the  day.   Figure  6  includes  the  crash  diagrams 
which show the approximate location of the 20082010 crashes in the study area.  
        Section  10.1310.20  (SR176/Brookpark  Road  intersection):  The  highest  number  of 
        crashes  in  the  study  area  (61.5%)  occurred  in  this  section  at  the  Tintersection.    Most 
        were rearend crashes from motorists traveling southbound on SR176 and attempting to 
        turn  westbound  (right)  at  the  Tintersection.   They  were  predominately  on  a  dry  road, 
        during the day, and while following too closely. 
        Section  10.2010.31  (on  the  SR176  bridge):  There  were  three  crashes  (11.5%)  on  the 
        SR176  bridge,  just  north  of  the  intersection.   Two  were  fixed  object  ­  the  southbound 
        motorists  lost  control  of  their  vehicles  and  hit  the  parapet  in  the  median.    The  third 
        crash  was  also  in  the  southbound  direction  and  was  a  rearend  crash.  There  were  no 
        other apparent patterns to these crashes in this section. 
        Section  10.3110.43  (SR176,  east  of  the  SR176  bridge):  The  remaining  crashes  (26.9%) 
        occurred  just  east  of  the  bridge.    Most  of  the  crashes  involved  motorists  striking  the 
        parapet  or  guardrail  in  the  westbound/southbound  direction.    The  remaining  crashes 
        were  two  sideswipepassing  and  one  animalinvolved  crash.   The  road  conditions  varied 
        between dry, wet, and snow, and the severity and light conditions also varied.

I480/SR176 Interchange Ramps & SR176 North of the Interchange 
From  January  1,  2008  through  December  31,  2010,  a  total  of  45  crashes  (60%)  that  were 
originally  logged  within  the  study  limits  actually  occurred on  the  interchange  ramps  or  north  of 
the  interchange  instead.  Of  the  45  crashes,  20  were  fixed  object  (44.4%),  12  were  rearends 
(26.7%),  and  ten  were  sideswipe  passing  (22.2%),  comprising  93.3%  of  the  crashes.    Of  the 
remaining  three  crashes,  two  involved  parked  vehicles  and  one  was  animalrelated.   Fifteen  of 
the  crashes  (33.3%)  involved  an  injury,  but  none  were  fatal.  Over  half  of  the  crashes  (57.8%) 
occurred  on  slippery  roads  that  were  snowy,  icy,  or  wet,  and  over  half  (57.8%)  occurred  on  a 
curved portion of roadway.  Although the crashes were spread throughout all days of the week, 
there were peaks during the winter months (51.1%) along with late morning (9:00AM11:00AM, 
the  evening  rush  hour  (5:00PM6:00PM,  and  late  at  night  (10:00PM).    Figure  7  includes  the 
crash diagram which shows the approximate locations of the 20082010 crashes in this location. 
 
Crash Analysis Patterns & Conclusions 
Broadview Road/Brookpark Road Intersection 
Crashes outside study areas so were not analyzed as part of this study. 
 
Study Area ­ Log Point 10.13 (SR176/Brookpark Road Intersection) to 10.43 
Most  crashes  in  the  study  area  occurred  on  SR176  southbound  involving  motorists  turning 
westbound  (right)  on  Brookpark  Road  under  no  adverse  conditions  and  at  various  times  of  the 
day,  week,  and  year.    This  pattern  is  indicative  of  motorists  attempting  to  hurry  through  the 
intersection  without  taking  the  time  to  fully  stop  and  assess  the  traffic  situation  both  on 
Brookpark  Road  and  directly  in  front  of  them.  There  is  also  be  a  visibility  issue  due to  the  angle 
at which they are situated in the turn lane and then having to look back over their shoulders to 
see if there is any oncoming traffic before make the right turn (on red). 
 
Also,  most  of  the  fixed  object  crashes  occurred  either  in  the  curved  section  of  SR176  or  on  the 
approach to the curved section in various weather conditions.  This indicates that motorists are 
not decelerated to a safe speed as they transition from the expressway to the curved section of 
roadway and upcoming Tintersection. 
 
I480/SR176 Interchange Ramps & SR176 North of the Interchange 
Most crashes in this area involved  motorists losing control  of their vehicles and striking median 
walls or guardrails during adverse weather conditions on the curved sections of the ramps.  This 
pattern indicates that motorists are not taking appropriate measures to reduce speed and drive 
carefully  in  adverse  weather  conditions,  especially  on  the  curved  sections  of  the  interchange 
ramps.   In  addition,  AM  and  PM  peak  hour  congestion  may  be  a  contributing  factor  to  crashes 
on the SR 176 SB ramps to I480 EB (in the AM) and I480 WB (in the PM.)

5.0  TRANSPORTATION ANALYSIS 
 
Traffic count and signal information is provided in Appendix B. 
 
An  8hour  turning  movement  count  was  completed  at  the  intersection  on  Tuesday,  March  20, 
2012.  Growth  factors  based  on  the  NOACA2030  model  showed  a  slight  decline  in  traffic  over 
the next 20 years.  For the traffic analysis purposes, the existing 2012 traffic volumes will be the 
same as the 2030 traffic volumes.  
 
Capacity  is  the  volume  of  traffic  that  can  pass  through  a  roadway  facility  in  a  given  amount  of 
time  (vehicles/hour).    The  concept  of  Level  of  Service  (LOS)  is  a  qualitative  measure  of  the 
operation  of  the  traffic  flow.    LOS  considers  such  factors  as  speed,  travel  time,  freedom  to 
maneuver,  traffic  interruptions,  driver  inconvenience,  safety  and  delay.    For  different 
transportation facilities, the LOS is based on different measures of effectiveness.   
 
Signalized  intersections  are  measured  for  average  control  delay  in  seconds  per  vehicle.  Control 
delay  includes  initial  deceleration  delay,  queue  moveup  time,  stopped  delay  and  final 
deceleration  delay.    The  delay  measurement  for  vehicles  at  a  signalized  intersection  is  a 
combination of driver discomfort, driver frustration and lost travel time. 
 
The  LOS  rating  system  as  described  in  the  2000  Highway  Capacity  Manual  gives  a  value  of  A 
through  F  to  each  type  of  roadway  facility  representing  best  to  worst  traffic  conditions.  When 
designing for roadway improvements, it is desirable to accommodate design peak hour volumes 
at a LOS C or D.  The table below summarizes the levels of service for signalized intersections.  
 
                         Level of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections 
                       Level of Service  Average Control Delay 
                              A             Less than 10.0 seconds per vehicle 
                               B            10.1 to 20.0 seconds per vehicle 
                               C            20.1 to 35.0 seconds per vehicle 
                              D             35.1 to 55.0 seconds per vehicle 
                               E            55.1 to 80.0 seconds per vehicle 
                               F            Greater than 80.0 seconds per vehicle 

 
The  signalized  intersection  of  SR  176  and  Brookpark  Road  operates  as  an  isolated  intersection 
with cycle lengths varying from 72 to 100 seconds depending on the traffic demand.  The traffic 
signal is a 3phase signal with an eastbound leftturn and a southbound rightturn overlap.  The 
southbound  rightturn  arrow  comes  on  during  the  southbound  through  phase  (phase  3)  and 
stays  on  through  the  eastbound  leftturn  phase.    If  the  eastbound  leftturn  phase  is  not

activated,  then  the  southbound  rightturn  arrow  terminates  with  the  southbound  through 
phase.    
 
Existing  signal  timings  were  received  from  the  City  of  Cleveland.    The  table  on  the  following 
page  shows  the  existing  yellow  and  allred  times  along  with  the  recommended  yellow  and  all
red  times.   Since  Brookpark  Road  has  a  35  mph  speed  limit,  it  is  recommended  to  increase  the 
3.0  second  yellow  interval  to  3.6  seconds.   Also,  since  traffic  coming  from  the  freeway  section 
of  SR  176  could  be  traveling  faster  than  25  mph,  it  is  recommended  to  also  increase  the  yellow 
interval to 3.6 seconds.

    Reduce  the  minimum  green  for  the  eastbound  leftturn  phase  from  10  seconds  to  7 
       seconds.   This  will  allow  the  leftturn  phase  to  switch  over  quicker  during  offpeak  time 
       periods. 
    Replace the pedestrian push buttons to cross SR176 with a more rugged design. 
    After  replacing  the  pedestrian  pushbuttons,  reduce  the  minimum  green  for  the 
       westbound  through  phase  (phase  2)  from  37  seconds  to  20  seconds  and  turn  off  the 
       Pedestrian Recall for phase 2.

        Although  the  crash  data  does  not  indicate  issues,  it  is  recommended  to  upgrade  all 
        signal heads to LED with backplates with reflective strips where still needed. 
 
The  intersection  capacity  analysis  was  conducted  in  Synchro  8  and  SimTraffic.   The  existing  and 
optimized  timings  were  analyzed,  as  well  as  changing  the  southbound  approach  from  one  left
turn  lane  and  one  rightturn  lane  to  a  left/rightturn  lane  and  a  rightturn  lane.   A  southbound 
no  rightturn  on  red  (NTOR)  analysis  was  also  completed  to  see  how  much  the  southbound 
delay  would  increase  by  implementing  a  NTOR  restriction.   Because  the  southbound  approach 
experienced  12  rearend  crashes  in  the  rightturn  lane,  a  NTOR  restriction  may  potentially 
reduce rearend crashes.     
 
As  shown  in  the  Intersection  Level  of  Service  Results  table  below,  the  existing  and  optimized 
peak  hour  analysis  shows  the  intersection  operates  at  a  level  of  service  "B"  in  the  AM  and  "D" 
in PM peak hours. The optimized cycle length in the AM peak hour is 95 seconds and in the PM 
peak  hour  a  100  seconds.    The  southbound  no  rightturn  on  red  scenario  shows  very  similar 
delays  when  comparing  it  to  the  optimized  timings  scenario.    The  southbound  rightturn 
movement  delay  goes  up  by  about  five  seconds  in  the  PM  peak  hour  for  the  no  rightturn  on 
red restriction. Although the no right turn on red restriction would not significantly increase the 
delay of the southbound rightturn traffic in the peak hours, it would increase delay more in the 
off  peak  hours  when  vehicles  tend  to  make  more  right  turns  on  red  because  there  are  more 
gaps in traffic on Brookpark Road.  
 
The  analysis  of  a  southbound  right/leftturn  lane  and  a  rightturn  lane  shows  the  least  delay  in 
the  PM  peak  hour  of  all  the  other  scenarios.   The  analysis was  completed  in  SimTraffic  because 
Synchro  8  model  was  giving  incorrect  delays  for  the  southbound  approach.    This  scenario 
assumed  right  turns  on  red  are  allowed.    One  concern  of  changing  the  southbound  leftturn 
lane to a right/leftturn lane is that it may create more vehicle lane changes on Brookpark Road 
if much of the rightturn traffic from SR176 is making a leftturn onto  Broadview Road, which is 
about 1,000 feet west of the SR176 intersection.  It is unknown how much traffic makes a right
turn  from  southbound  SR176  and  then  makes  a  leftturn  onto  Broadview  Road.    It  is 
recommended  that  this  origindestination  path  be  investigated  before  making  any  changes  to 
the SR176 southbound approach.

6.0  PREVIOUS/FUTURE PROJECTS 
 
The following recently completed and future projects have been identified in the study area: 
      D12 restriped SR176 SB  ramp to I480 EB to one  lane in 2010 on districtwide pavement 
        marking contract. 
      Upcoming  districtwide  barrier  upgrade  in  FY2013  to  remove  sloped  concrete  end 
        terminal with a more crashworthy treatment. 
      Upcoming  urban  paving  project  (PID:  89267)  currently  in  FY2018.    This  project  is  a 
        potential  candidate  to  incorporate  mediumterm  recommendation  for  suggested 
        improvement of exit ramp terminal. 
 
In  addition,  the  history  of  the  SR176/Brookpark  Road  intersection  originally  included  plans  to 
extend  SR176  southbound  through  Brookpark  Road  to  connect  with  W  16th  Street  in  order  to 
provide  an  additional  connection  with  Broadview  Road  to  the  west  since  the  dominant  traffic 
movement  is  currently  southbound  on  SR176  to  westbound  on  Brookpark  Road  to  southbound 
on Broadview Road in the PM peak hour (which is reversed in the AM peak hour).

7.0  PROPOSED COUNTERMEASURES & DESIGN EVALUATIONS 
 
Broadview Road/Brookpark Road Intersection 
Crashes outside study areas so were not analyzed as part of this study. 
 
Study Area ­ Log Point 10.13 (SR176/Brookpark Road Intersection) to 10.43 
Due  to  the  high  number  of  southbound  rearend  crashes  in  the  right  turn  lane  at  the 
SR176/Brookpark  Road  intersection,  it  is  recommended  to  make  some  minor  adjustments  to 
the  intersection.   The  crash  pattern  appears  to  be  related  to  visibility  issues,  so  to  address  this 
problem,  it  is  recommended  to  reengineer  the  southbound  right  turn  lane  to  straighten  it  out 
so that motorists will not (a) be tempted to stop past the stop bar, and (b) need to look back at 
a  135°  angle  to  observe  oncoming  Brookpark  Road  traffic,  thus  impairing  their  ability  to  see  in 
front  of  them.    The  turning  radius  and  edge  of  pavement  would  also  need  to  be  modified  to 
support  this  change.   In  addition,  replacing  the  tapered  end  of  the  median  wall  with  an  impact 
attenuator should be considered to improve safety. 
 
 

    Motorists do not stop at the stop                                             Install impact attenuator to

To  address  the  fixed  object  crashes,  it  is  recommended  to  install  warning  signage  to  encourage 
motorists  to  decrease  speed  when  navigating  the  curve  plus  replace  the  two  Tintersection 
ahead warning signs just east of the curve with leftcurve ahead warning signs.  To determine a 
recommended speed limit for the curve, a ball bank test should also be performed.  In addition, 
restripe the faded pavement markings at the SR176/Brookpark Road intersection, including the 
crosswalks  ­  especially  the  northsouth  crosswalk  where  one  section  is  completely  missing,  in 
addition to repaving Brookpark Road to address deteriorated pavement and potholes. 
 
It  is  also  recommended  to  upgrade  all  signal  heads  to  LED  signal  head  with  backplates  with 
reflective  strips,  where  still  needed to  enhance  visibility  of  signal  heads  and  upgrade 
signals/operation  to  current  practices.   At  the  SR176/Brookpark  Road  intersection  some  minor 
adjustments to the signal timings and cross walk timings are also recommended. 
 
I480/SR176 Interchange Ramps & SR176 North of the Interchange 
Based  on  the  available  crash  data  for  this  study,  additional  signage  to  indicate  curves  and  to 
recommend  slower  speeds  is  recommended.    A  pavement  study  is  also  recommended  to 
explore  whether  horizontal  tining  of  the  existing  pavement  (or  some  other  treatment)  would 
assist in providing additional traction for vehicles utilizing the interchange ramps.  In addition, it 
is  recommended  that  District  perform  a  more  detailed  study  of  the  entire  SR176/I480 
interchange  to  evaluate  crash  patterns  and  consider  possible  improvements  in  lane  use  to 
better handle traffic demand. 
 
 
8.0  STUDY AREA RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
These  recommendations  are  based  upon  identified  safety  deficiencies,  traffic,  and  site 
conditions  in  the  study  area.  Several  factors  were  considered  when  developing 
countermeasures  and  recommendations,  including  engineering,  enforcement,  driver  education 
or  a  combination  of  factors.  A  combination  of  the  below  suggested  improvements  may  be  the 
best practical countermeasure for these locations: 
 
Recommended ShortTerm Countermeasures  
 Install  Impact  Attenuator  on  SR176  Median  Wall:  at  the  SR176/Brookpark  Road 
     intersection,  replace  the  tapered  portion  of  the  median  wall  on  SR176  closest  to  the 
     intersection  with  an  impact  attenuator.   Perform  this  activity  as  part  of  the  upcoming  NHS 
     barrier upgrade in FY2013. 
 Restripe  Brookpark  Road  Pavement  Markings:  Within  500'  of  the  SR176/Brookpark  Road 
     intersection,  restripe  the  pavement  markings  ­  especially  the  intersection  crosswalks.  (If 
     Brookpark  Road  will  be  repaved  in  the  near  future,  perform  this  recommendation  with  the 
     paving project to save time and money.) 
 Install  Curve  Warning  Signage  &  Rumble  Strips:  replace  the  two  existing  Tintersection 
     ahead  warning  signs  (R24)  with  signs  to  indicate  a  horizontal  curve  ahead  (R12L)  on  both

    sides  on  SR176  in  advance  of  the  curve;  add  two  3'  groups  of  rumble  strips  on  the 
    southbound side in advance of the curve. 
 Perform  Ball  Bank  Study:  perform  a  ball  bank  study  for  the  SR176  curve  to  determine  the 
    safe advisory speed for the curve. 
 Upgrade/Update Signals: on Brookpark Road, increase the 3.0 second yellow interval to 3.6 
    seconds;  and  on  SR176,  increase  the  yellow  interval  to  3.6  seconds.   Reduce  the  minimum 
    green  for  the  eastbound  leftturn  phase  from  10  seconds  to  7  seconds.    Replace  the 
    pedestrian  push  buttons  with  a  more  rugged  design.  Increase  the  "Flashing  Don't  Walk" 
    times  to  account  for  new  OMUTCD  standards.  After  replacing  the  pedestrian  push  buttons, 
    reduce  the minimum  green  for  the westbound  through  phase  (phase  2)  from  37  seconds  to 
    20  seconds  and  turn  off  the  Pedestrian  Recall  for  phase  2.   Upgrade  all  signal  heads  to  LED 
    with backplates with reflective strips where still needed. 
 SR176/I480  Interchange  Safety  Study:    perform  a  more  detailed  study  of  the  entire 
    SR176/I480  interchange  to  evaluate  crash  patterns  and  consider  possible  improvements  in 
    lane use to better handle traffic demand. 
 Remove  Driveway  Apron:  eliminate  unused  drive  apron  in  the  northeast  quadrant  of  the 
    SR176/Brookpark Road intersection along Brookpark Road.  
 Restripe  Center  Lane  for  TWLT:  east  of  the  Tintersection  along  Brookpark  Road  in  the 
    northeast  quadrant,  the  parcel  has  been  newly  developed.   As  a  result,  due  to  the  addition 
    of a new driveway for this parcel, the Brookpark Road center lane should be restriped in this 
    location  to  accommodate  a  twoway  left  turn  lane  for  this  driveway  access.   Combine  with 
    restriping Brookpark Road recommendation if possible to save money. 
     
The estimated cost of the shortterm improvements would be $58,200.  
 
 
Recommended MediumTerm Countermeasures 
 Straighten  SR176  Southbound  Right  Turn  Lane:  realign  the  SR176  southbound  right  turn 
    lane  to  make  it  perpendicular  to  Brookpark  Road  and  perform  the  necessary  modifications 
    to  the  edge  of  pavement,  curb,  and  sidewalk  for  this  realignment.  Consider  performing  this 
    recommendation in the upcoming paving project (PID: 89267). See Figure 8. 
 Repave  Brookpark  Road:  Within  600'  of  the  SR176/Brookpark  Road  intersection,  repave 
    Brookpark Road. 
 
The  estimated  cost  of  for  the  mediumterm  improvements  would  be  $235,590.    The  rate  of 
return for these improvements would be 33.38%, with an average annual benefit of $78,900.  
 
 
Additional Possible Countermeasures 
The  countermeasures  recommended  in  the  shortterm  and  mediumterm  address  the  crash 
issues  identified  in  the  study  area,  so  no  longterm  countermeasures  are  recommended.

However, if the aboveproposed countermeasures are implemented and a similar crash pattern 
continues, two additional options could be explored: 
    Restrict  the  southbound  right  turn  on  red:  Perform  an  origindestination  study  for  the 
    combined  SR176/Brookpark  Road  intersection  and  Brookpark  Road/Broadview  Road 
    intersection  area  to  determine  if  restricting  the  right  turn  on  red  at  the  SR176  southbound 
    approach  is  feasible  for  the  travel  patterns.    If  feasible,  install  the  necessary  signage.  
    Continuous enforcement will be important. 
    Perform  an  additional  study  at  the  intersection:  evaluate  more  costly  options,  such  as  the 
    viability  of  vertically  and/or  horizontally  realigning  the  SR176  bridge  to  remove/reduce  the 
    curve and thus improve sight distances and safety.

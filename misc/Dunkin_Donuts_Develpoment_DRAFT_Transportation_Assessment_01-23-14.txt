Subject:       Preliminary Transportation Assessment

Dear Mr. Smith:




                                                       T
The contents of this letter present the findings of a preliminary transportation assessment that was conducted for
the proposed Dunkin Donuts Development, to be located along Catawba Avenue, south of Magnolia Estates
                                     AF
Drive in Cornelius, North Carolina. The purpose of this assessment is to present a summary of the site plan
review and transportation impacts of the development to the transportation network surrounding the site.

Existing Traffic

An existing turn movement count of the Catawba Avenue and Magnolia Estates Drive intersection was
                          R
obtained. The count was conducted in 2012 during the AM and PM peak hours. This count was used to
estimate the through volume on Catawba Avenue at the proposed site drive. The count volumes were projected
to the year 2014 using a compounded growth rate of 3% per year. The resulting through volumes can be found
in Figure 1.

Site Trip Generation

Trip generation for the development was completed utilizing the 9th Edition of the ITE Trip Generation manual.
It is our understanding that the proposed development will consist of 2,200 square feet of Dunkin Donuts with
attached Baskin Robbins, and 3,200 square feet of retail space. Trips were generated using ITE land use codes
940: Bread/Donut/Bagel Shop with Drive-Through Window and 820: Shopping Center. Trip generation
calculations indicate that the proposed development is expected to generate approximately 89 trips during the
AM peak hour and 54 trips during the PM peak hour. Refer to Table 1 below for an illustration of the trip
generation for the proposed development.

Transportation Mitigation and Impacts

Capacity analysis was conducted for the proposed site driveway during both the AM and PM peak hours.
Through volumes on Catawba Avenue were estimated based on the traffic count at the intersection of Catawba
Avenue and Magnolia Estates Drive. The count volume was projected to the year 2014 using a compounded
growth rate of 3% per year. The traffic count shows that the volume on Catawba Avenue is approximately even
if both directions of Catawba Avenue. Turn movements at the proposed driveway were based on the trip




                                                       T
generation of the proposed site and were split evenly in each direction of Catawba Avenue. The estimated
volumes at the Catawba Avenue and proposed site driveway intersection can be found in Figure 1. Capacity
analysis reports for this intersection are attached.
                                     AF
The results of the proposed site driveway analysis show that Catawba Avenue is expected to operate at LOS A
during both peak hours. The proposed site driveway is expected to operate at LOS F during both peak hours due
to the high through volumes on Catawba Avenue. The queue on the proposed site driveway is expected to be
held within the site. Based on NCDOT turn lane criteria, no turn lanes are expected to be warranted at the
proposed site driveway due to the low turning volumes.
                            R

Based on this analysis and review of the site plan, existing traffic volumes, and site trip generation, the Dunkin
Donuts Development is not expected to have a significant impact on the surrounding transportation network.

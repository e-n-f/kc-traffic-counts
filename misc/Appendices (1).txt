               Origin-Destination Study Results
               FHU Reference No. 09-076-01


This memorandum summarizes the results of the origin-destination study (O-D study) conducted
for the High School Road Corridor Traffic Analysis project. The O-D study was undertaken to
provide field data that quantifies the traffic volume that could potentially use the proposed Tribal
Trail Road extension to WY 22 west of town. This field data will be used in conjunction with Teton
County's travel demand forecasting model to project traffic volumes on that road in both the near
term and long term.

DATA COLLECTION

The O-D study was conducted on Tuesday, July 14, 2009 to capture typical mid-week conditions in
the summer. Based on Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT) data, July has the
highest average daily traffic volumes of the year, so the data collected represents conditions during
the peak travel period. The intent of the study was to quantify the traffic volumes traveling between
the west side (i.e., Teton Pass, Wilson and the Teton Village Road) and the north end of South
Park (local traffic); south South Park (also local traffic); and areas south of Jackson (through
traffic), so survey stations were set up at the following locations (Figure 1):

At each survey location two person teams recorded license plate numbers of vehicles travelling in
both directions on the roadway from 7 AM to 10 AM, 11 AM to 2 PM, and 3 PM to 7 PM to capture
travel data in both the morning and afternoon peak periods as well as the mid-day travel period.
To the best extent possible the surveyors recorded plate numbers for all of the vehicles on the road
during the nine hours of data collection so that the data set represented a significant portion of the
total daily traffic on each roadway.

Table 1 compares the number of license plates recorded at each survey station with the typical
total daily traffic (24-hour count) for that roadway, and indicates that in each case over half of the
total daily traffic was captured in the nine hour study period.

Unfortunately, because of the high traffic volumes at each station (particularly the West Side
station) it was not possible to collect data on the number of bicycle riders at each location, as had
been requested by Friends of Pathways.

Since the purpose of the study was to provide an assessment of potential travel on the Tribal Trail
Road extension, the plates at the west side location were matched up with plates at each of the
five south locations. Travel between any pair of south end sites was not recorded (e.g. between
South South Park Loop Road and High School Road), since those vehicles would not use the
proposed extension. Furthermore, plate matching was only conducted within each study time
period and not across time periods, so if, for example, a vehicle passed the west side site in the
morning and then a south end site in the mid day or evening, it would not have been matched,
since it was assumed that such traffic had an interim destination in town or north of town and
therefore would not shift to the Tribal Trail extension if it were provided.

STUDY RESULTS

Table 2 summarizes the overall study results and provides percentages related to the total daily
traffic on WY 22 on the west side of the Snake River. As the table indicates, approximately 5,000
vehicles (22 percent of the WY 22 traffic on the west side) has origins or destinations south of
town. Of that total, 12 percent is from the north end of South Park, four percent is from south
South Park, and six percent is through traffic from south of town.

The matched license plate data was also examined as it related to the total daily traffic volume at
each south end study location, as shown in Table 3. The results are similar to those in Table 2, but
show a slightly higher overall traffic volume forecast due to the variation in the percentage of plates
captured at each location. The most significant change was at the station on WY 89 south of South
Park Loop Road, which increased by 290 vehicles per day because a lower percentage of plates
were captured there than at the other locations. To present a more conservative scenario, the
slightly higher forecast of 5,350 vehicles per day (vpd) yielded by the methodology summarized in
Table 3 was selected as the base west-south traffic volume forecast.

Traffic Volume Adjustments

While the origin-destination survey included survey stations on all of the significant traffic volume
roadways in the South Park area, several of the lower volume roads and driveways immediately
north of South South Park Loop Road were omitted to help streamline the data collection process.
West-South traffic from that area was forecast based on the data collected at the other south end
stations, as shown in Table 4. For the two roads in that area that access primarily residential
property, the west-south traffic percentage was forecast based on the data from the Big Trail Drive
and South South Park Loop Road stations, which also access primarily residential property. For
the commercial driveways, the North South Park Loop Road and High School Road data was used
to forecast west-south travel, since the land uses in North South Park includes commercial
development. These percentages were then applied to the total daily traffic volumes for each
location to determine the west-south traffic forecast. Based on this methodology, approximately
800 vpd is forecast to travel between the west side and the roads and businesses that area, which
increases the total west-south traffic volume forecast to 6,150 vpd.

3. 2006 WYDOT Traffic Count. WYDOT counts in that year indicated that daily volumes on WY 89 south of
   SPLR were similar to the July 2008 count there, and volumes on SPLR were 150 vpd lower in 2008 than
   2006. Thus it was determined that the other 2006 counts would be reasonably representative of current
   conditions.

SUMMARY

Table 5 summarizes the overall traffic forecast for travel between the west side, South Park and
areas south of town and provides the percentage of traffic from each area relative to the total traffic
volume on WY 22 on the west side. As the table indicates, approximately 6,150 vehicles per day
travel between those areas, which represents 27 percent of the total daily traffic volume on WY 22
on the west side. Of that total, approximately 2,690 vpd (12 percent) is from the north end of South
Park, 1,710 vpd (seven percent) is from south South Park, and 1,710 (eight percent) is through
traffic from south of town.

It should be noted that the above volumes represent the total traffic travelling between the west
side and the south end that might potentially use the Tribal Trail Road extension, but it does not
represent an actual traffic forecast for that road. The traffic forecasts for Tribal Trail Road would be
a somewhat lower subset of this total, since it is anticipated that some drivers will continue to use
WY 89 and WY 22 even after the extension is complete. The traffic forecast for Tribal Trail Road is
the next task to be completed for this project, and will be conducted once the Teton County travel
demand model is updated with the current comprehensive plan land use data.

Level of Service (Aver. Int. Delay): LOS B. Based on average delay for all vehicle movements. LOS Method: Delay (HCM).
Level of Service (Worst Movement): LOS B. LOS Method for individual vehicle movements: Delay (HCM).
Approach LOS values are based on the worst delay for any vehicle movement.
Roundabout LOS Method: Same as Signalised Intersections.
Roundabout Capacity Model: SIDRA Standard.

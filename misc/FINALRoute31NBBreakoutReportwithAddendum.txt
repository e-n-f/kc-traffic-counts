        NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza



                               Executive Summary
Project Location
NJ Route 31 is a state facility that begins in Trenton and travels north through three
counties in western New Jersey to its northern terminus with U.S. Route 46. NJ Route
31 provides a key link between Interstate 78 in northern Hunterdon County, U.S. Route
202 in Raritan Township, and Interstate 95 just north of Trenton. As such, NJ Route 31
helps serve as one of the few regional north-south connections in this part of New
Jersey. The portion of Route 31 within the project limits lies in the Township of Raritan
in Hunterdon County, and is functionally classified by NJDOT as an urban principal
arterial with the number of lanes varying between two and five.
Problem Background
In late 2008, a Feasibility Assessment study was initiated for a section of Route 31
between Church Street (MP 22.21) and River Road (MP 25.26). In early 2009, the
Commissioner received a letter from the current Deputy Mayor and former Mayor of
Raritan Township, John King, indicating that the current roadway configuration of
northbound Route 31 at Minneakoning Road (MP 23.84) creates "a dangerous traffic
pattern". The Township's Police Chief said "the abrupt termination of the merge lane at
the Minneakoning intersection is dangerous and unacceptable. It's an invitation for
disaster."
In response to the letter, DPD investigated the situation and observed vehicles
behaving in a pattern generally consistent with the Mayor's and Police Chief's
observations and concerns. It appears that multiple problems occur. Some drivers use
the second lane as a means to pass queued traffic in the thru lane and then "force" their
way in near or at the intersection. Other drivers seem unaware of the need to merge
until they are at or near the intersection creating sudden stops and merges. Potentially
contributing to the issue, is that it is not uncommon for the northbound Route 31 queues
at Minneakoning Road to extend beyond the merge signs, thus drivers who are
unfamiliar with the roadway realize they need to merge at a point where traffic is queued
in the other lane resulting in a more difficult merge.
This current roadway configuration of Route 31 northbound at Minneakoning is a result
of roadway changes made as part of the Raritan Town Square Development Major
Access agreement with NJDOT.
As part of the agreement, the developers of the Raritan Town Square extended the
second northbound Route 31 thru lane, previously ending shortly after Walter Foran
Drive, to Minneakoning Road. It had been DPD's and Major Access' intention that the
second thru lane extend beyond Minneakoning; however, in the final "fair share"
agreement the second lane terminated as a right-turn only lane at Minneakoning Road.
In May 2009, a "breakout" of the overall Route 31 FA project was approved for project
development. The breakout project limits extended from Minneakoning Road to
Prestige Plaza (MP 24.73). The expectation was to advance the breakout project as a
"quick fix" Pipeline 3 project. The intent of the breakout was to address the safety
issues while limiting ROW width and the potential impacts possible due to existing
conditions (i.e., an existing fill section with side slopes south of the Bartles Corner




                                             1

Intersection). Additionally, the goal was to advance this project at a rapid pace with an
advertisement date set for the fall of 2010.
Summary of Issues and Concerns
The overall purpose of the Route 31 FA project is to improve safety conditions and
reduce existing and projected congestion and delay along the corridor. The proposed
breakout project has the same project purpose with a focus on addressing safety issues
at the intersection of Route 31 and Minneakoning Road.
Crash analysis was completed for NJ Route 31 within approximately the breakout
project limits. Based on data from 2005 through 2007, within the approximate one (1)
mile section of Route 31, there were 162 crashes. The crash rate for this section
exceeds the statewide average by 89%.
In addition to the safety concerns, vehicles traveling in this section of Route 31
experience excessive delays and queues at several locations including the intersections
of NJ Route 31 with Minneakoning Road (LOS F) and Bartles Corner Road (LOS E), as
well as at lane drop locations where travel lanes are reduced from two lanes to one lane
per direction. These conditions are projected to significantly deteriorate as anticipated
and future development occurs in and around the corridor.
Initially Preferred Alternative (IPA)
There were four different alternatives that were generated for the Feasibility
Assessment portion of this project. These four alternatives, which are described in
more detail in Section II: Alternatives Analysis, were designated as follows:
Alternative 1 ­ Minneakoning Road to Wescott Drive
Alternative 2 ­ Minneakoning Road to Healthquest Boulevard
Alternative 2A ­ Minneakoning Road to Prestige Plaza
Alternative 3 ­ Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza
Comments from Local Officials and Scope Team members resulted in Alternative 3
being selected as the IPA. The implementation of the IPA would address the Town's
concerns at Minneakoning Road expressed in the letter to the Commissioner. This
alternative, as shown through the results of simulation analysis, also addresses the
Town's and County's concerns that a solution that did not extend beyond Bartles Corner
Road was merely "shifting the problem".
Recommendations
The IPA selected as part of the Feasibility Assessment portion of this project is
recommended for advancement as a Pipeline 3 project.

4. Project Need
Following an evaluation of existing conditions, the following needs have been
identified:
Improve Safety: The current roadway configuration of northbound Route 31 at
Minneakoning Road creates an undesirable traffic condition. Additionally,
there is a high number of crashes along the corridor particularly at the
signalized intersections, lane drop locations and merge points.
Reduce Current and Future Congestion and Delay: Currently, there are
excessive delays and queuing at the intersections of NJ Route 31 with
Minneakoning Road and Bartles Corner Road, as well as at the lane drop
locations where travel lanes reduce from two per direction to one per direction.
These conditions are projected to significantly deteriorate as approved,
anticipated and future development occurs in and around the corridor.

5. Project limits
The project limits extend from Minneakoning Road (M.P. 23.84) to
approximately 1000' beyond (M.P.24.94) the signalized intersection at the
Prestige Plaza Shopping Center.

6. Project Location
The portion of Route 31 within the project limits lies in the Township of Raritan
in Hunterdon County. The limits of the study area have been identified on the
attached Project Location Map illustrated as Figure 1.

     2. Coordination Input

          a. NJDOT Internal Coordination
          A Core Group Meetings was held on October 2, 2009 at NJDOT in
          Trenton, NJ. The results of the meeting are documented in the meeting
          minutes which are located in Appendix B (Coordination and
          Correspondence).
          Additionally, as part of the background information, the project limits were
          checked with the following Management Systems:




                                            6
NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


     Pavement Management System (PMS)
     Pavement Management System Information for this section of Route 31
     was not provided. Visual inspection of the roadway suggests that the
     roadway surface is in good to fair condition. The anticipated scope of
     work associated with this effort will include reconstruction and resurfacing
     of the existing roadway for the project limits.
     Bridge Management System (BMS)
     There are two structures within the project area. The first structure (No.
     1012153) is a culvert that crosses under Route 31 at Minneakoning Creek
     and the second structure (No. 1012154) is a culvert that crosses under
     Route 31 at Assiscong Creek. These structures will not be impacted by
     the proposed alternatives nor was any Management Systems information
     given for these structures for this report, as they were recently
     reconstructed during the Route 31 Section 6D project.
     Congestion Management System (CMS)
     Based on the NJDOT Bureau of Systems Development & Analysis CMS
     Priority Ranking, the corridor links rank from Medium to High priority.
     Within the project limits, the two links volume to capacity (v/c) ratios are
     0.96 and 1.03. These v/c ratios indicate a priority ranking of 8 and 17 out
     of 167 as far congested links within the county. The CMS Priority Ranking
     table can be found in Appendix H (Management System Information).
     Drainage Management System (DMS)
     No DMS information was provided for the project limits.
     Maintenance Management System (MMS)
     At the time of the report, no maintenance projects were planned within the
     project limits.

     b. Community Relations Coordination
     As part of the process of selecting the IPA, DPD sought input from both
     internal and external stakeholders through presentations and meetings.
     The project was presented to the Raritan Township Local Officials in June
     of 2009. A Public Information Center was held at Raritan Township Police
     Building on December 14, 2009 to present the IPA to the public for their
     review and comment.
     The results of the meetings and the public information center summary are
     compiled in Appendix B (Coordination and Correspondence).
     A copy of the Township's Resolution of Support is provided in Appendix
     Q

     c. Summary of Issues and Concerns
     The overall purpose of the Route 31 FA project is to improve safety
     conditions and reduce existing and projected congestion and delay along



                                     7
NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


     the corridor. The proposed breakout project has the same project purpose
     with a focus at addressing the issues at Minneakoning Road.
     Crash analysis was completed for NJ Route 31 within approximately the
     breakout project limits. Based on data from 2005 through 2007, within the
     approximate one (1) mile section of Route 31, there were 163 crashes.
     The crash rate for this section exceeds the statewide average by 89%.
     In addition to the safety concerns, vehicles traveling in this section of
     Route 31 experience excessive delays and queues at several locations
     including the intersections of NJ Route 31 with Minneakoning Road (LOS
     F) and Bartles Corner Road (LOS E), as well as at lane drop locations
     where travel lanes reduce from two per direction to one per direction.
     These conditions are projected to significantly deteriorate as anticipated
     and future development occurs in and around the corridor.

3. Planning Related Input

     a. Region vs. Local Significance
     NJ Route 31 has both a local and regional significance. From a regional
     perspective, NJ Route 31 serves as a key link between I-95 in the south
     and I-78 and I-80 in the north. As such, NJ Route 31 provides one of the
     few regional north-south connections in this part of New Jersey making it
     an attractive and important route for regional traffic. From a local
     perspective, NJ Route 31 provides local significance since it serves as the
     main arterial through this portion of Raritan Township and has a mix of
     commercial, medical, residential and educational development along the
     corridor.

     b. State Development and Redevelopment Plan (SDRP)
     The State Development and Redevelopment Plan (SDRP) use a
     classification system to map the entire State into appropriate "planning
     areas" and contain associated policies and recommendations for each
     area. The NJ Route 31 corridor (and land bordering NJ Route 31) within
     the project limits is completely within Fringe Planning Area, PA3.
     The Fringe Planning Area is defined as a predominantly rural landscape
     that is not prime agricultural or environmentally sensitive land, with
     scattered small communities and freestanding residential, commercial and
     industrial development. The intent of Fringe Planning Areas is:
        1. Protect environment-culturally, as a resource and as a buffer to
           urbanized areas
        2. Accommodate new growth in existing centers or proposed centers
           (which includes sewer and public water services)
        3. Protect the character of the area

        4. Infrastructure, in centers, should be provided by the private sector
           except where joint public/private investment would benefit the
           public.
     The Statewide Development Re-Development Plan can be found in
     Appendix D.

     c. Planned Developments
     The project is located in an area that displays a range of development
     patterns from the historic mixed use grid pattern of Flemington, to the
     commercial strip development along NJ Route 31 and U.S. Route 202.
     There are a number of developments either in the planning stages or
     under construction. These include the Flemington Fairgrounds
     Redevelopment as the Raritan Town Square, the expansion to the
     Hunterdon Medical Center, the expansion to the Health Quest
     Development, and the introduction of new stores and development at the
     Prestige Plaza. In addition, there are several smaller developments
     planned for parcels either adjacent to NJ Route 31, or on roadways which
     intersect with NJ Route 31.

     d. Corridor Compatibility
     The existing NJ Route 31 corridor in this section varies between two (2)
     and five (5) lanes, with shoulders of varying width. New Jersey State
     Highway Access Management Code assigns NJ Route 31 in this section a
     DTS of 4A which is 4 lanes, divided with shoulders or parking. Within the
     study area, some sections of NJ Route 31 do not satisfy the suggested
     DTS.
     The applicable pages of the Access Management Code have been
     provided in Appendix E.

     e. Project Category
     This project is categorized as a safety and capacity improvement. For
     cost estimating purposes this project is categorized as General
     Construction, work type code GENC, as per the NJDOT Cost Estimating
     Guidelines, Appendix A, Table A-1.

     f. Needs Statement
     Following an evaluation of existing conditions, the following needs have
     been identified:
        1. Improve Safety: The current roadway configuration of northbound
           Route 31 at Minneakoning Road creates an undesirable traffic
           condition. Additionally, there is a high rate of crashes along the
           corridor compared to state averages with a concentration of the
           crashes occurring at the signalized intersections, lane drop
           locations and merge points.

NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza




        2. Reduce Current and Future Congestion and Delay: Currently, there
           are excessive delays and queuing at the intersections of NJ Route
           31 with Minneakoning Road and Bartles Corner Road, as well as at
           the lane drop locations where travel lanes reduce from two per
           direction to one per direction. These conditions are projected to
           significantly deteriorate as approved, anticipated and future
           development occurs in and around the corridor.


4. Existing Conditions Analysis

     a. Highway Classification
     Within the project limits, NJ Route 31 is functionally classified as an Urban
     Principal Arterial.

     b. Characteristics of the Roadway and Surrounding Area
     NJ Route 31 is a state facility that begins in Trenton and travels north
     through three counties in western New Jersey to its northern terminus with
     U.S. Route 46. NJ Route 31 provides a key link between Interstate 78 in
     northern Hunterdon County, U.S. Route 202 in Raritan Township, and
     Interstate 95 just north of Trenton. As such, NJ Route 31 helps serve as
     one of the few regional north-south connections in this part of New Jersey.
     The portion of Route 31 within the project limits lies in the Township of
     Raritan in Hunterdon County, and is functionally classified by NJDOT as
     an urban principal arterial with the number of lanes varying between two
     and five.
     Flemington Borough and Raritan Township are home to a large number of
     retail stores and shopping outlets. The stores are located along NJ Route
     31 and US Route 202 as well as in Flemington Borough. Traffic
     generated by these retail shops typically travel via US 202, NJ 31 and NJ
     12. Motorists accessing the shopping areas from the north utilize the
     project's section of NJ Route 31.

     c. Environmental Screening
     This section of Route 31 was reconstructed as part of the Route 31
     Section 6D project which included Categorical Exclusion level
     documentation. Following coordination with internal NJDOT Environmental
     Staff, the determination was made that an environmental screening was
     unnecessary due to the previous CED efforts combined with the
     environmental coordination associated with the Flemington Bypass and
     South Branch Parkway Projects.
     Consultation with SHPO was completed on 10/20/09 for the current CED
     effort. A copy of the consultation letter is provided in Appendix B.

     d. Existing Roadway Inventory & Deficiencies
     The purpose of this section is to evaluate physical roadway features and
     to cite all existing roadway deficiencies with respect to conformance of
     current roadway design standards. The evaluation of the roadway
     deficiencies was conducted using the NJDOT Roadway Design Manual,
     available plans, and field observation data.

     e.   Existing Roadway Inventory & Deficiencies

          (1) Horizontal Alignment
          In accordance with the Roadway Design Manual (RDM), Table 2-1
          (Sec. 2-03.3), the existing 45 and 50 mph speed limits along NJ Route
          31 result in design speeds of 50 and 55 mph respectively. In
          accordance with Table 4-5 (Sec. 4-03.3) the standard curve radii for
          urban highways with the above described design speeds are 926 and
          1190 feet respectively.
          A review of the available record drawings shows that there are a total
          of five (5) horizontal curves within the project limits. The existing
          curves and their properties are described in Table 2 below.
                     Table 2: Horizontal Curve Data

           1282+32                  45           50          2900           926



           1294+38                  50           55          4800          1190



           1299+66                  50           55          4800          1190



           1322+17                  50           55          3800          1190



          A review of the existing plans shows no horizontal curvature within the
          limits of the project that are substandard.

          (2) Vertical Alignment
          The NJDOT Roadway Design Manual (Sec. 4-04.4) specifies a
          minimum grade rate of 0.3% for freeways and land service highways.




                                     11
NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


         Review of the information gathered from our survey indicates an
         existing profile that exceeds the minimum.
         The NJDOT design criteria (Sec. 4-04.5) states the minimum
         allowable length of curve based on stopping sight distance is
         calculated by multiplying the algebraic difference in grades entering
         and exiting the vertical curve by K. The value K is the horizontal
         distance required to effect a percent change in gradient and is
         dependent on both design speed and type of curve (sag or crest).
         Additionally, flat vertical curves should be evaluated for aesthetics,
         drainage and rideability. In a crest curve, the minimum length should
         desirably be three (3) times the design speed (for English units). In a
         sag curve, the minimum length of curve should desirably be
         approximately equal to:
         L= AV2/46.5
         L = Length of sag vertical curve, ft.
         A = Algebraic difference in grades, percent.
         V = Design speed, mph.
         A review of the available record drawings shows that there are a total
         of five (5) vertical curves within the project limits. The existing curves
         and their properties are described in Table 3.

         * Deficient Curve
         Based on the record drawings and the above calculations, there is
         one curve that is deficient for sight distance.

         (3) Passing & Stopping Sight Distance
         Within the limits of the project, NJ Route 31 consists of a two lane
         section with no passing permitted, a three lane section with a two-way
         left turn lane, and four and five lane sections. Since passing sight
         distance is considered only on two-lane roads where passing is
         permitted, there is no need to evaluate passing sight distance on this
         project.
         Stopping Sight Distance on Horizontal Curves
         The evaluation of stopping sight distance on horizontal curves is
         based on the clear distance from the centerline of the inside lane of
         the curve to some type of obstruction. The minimum stopping sight
         distance is then computed based on the design speed of the roadway.
         The existing curves and their stopping sight distance values are
         shown in Table 4.
              Table 4: Stopping Sight Distance on Horizontal Curves

         Based on stopping sight distance calculations, record drawings and
         field visits, NJ Route 31 does not have any objects or physical
         features that would obstruct drivers stopping sight distance.
         Stopping Sight Distance on Vertical Curves
         The stopping sight distance criteria for vertical curves are based on
         the design speed, the length of curve and the algebraic difference in
         tangent grades. The existing curves and their stopping sight distance
         values are shown in Table 5.

         * Deficient Curve
         Based on the record drawings and the above calculations, there is
         one curve that is deficient for stopping sight distance on vertical
         curves.

         (4) Intersection Sight Distance
         Signalized Intersections
         The sight distance criteria at a signalized intersection provides some
         view in the case of signal violation, permitted right turn on red
         movements, and parked vehicle obstructions.
         The DMR (Sec. 6-03.4) specifies the minimum intersection sight
         distance should be at least equal to the stopping sight distance. The
         stopping sight distances required on NJ Route 31 for design speeds
         of 50 and 55 mph are 425 and 495 feet respectively. The results of
         the signalized intersection sight distance review are provided in Table
         6.
                  Table 6: Stopping Sight Distance at Signalized Intersections

NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


         Based on the record drawings and field observations, there is one (1)
         intersection that is deficient for stopping sight distance.
         Unsignalized Intersection
         Minimum intersection sight distance (ISD) is required at all non-
         signalized intersections and for any free flowing moves associated
         with a signalized intersection, in order to ensure that a motorist may
         safely enter of exit the State Highway System.
         The required ISD value varies based upon the mainline design speed,
         type of vehicle maneuver, and type of traffic control imposed on the
         side road traffic. As a minimum, stopping sight distance (SSD) must
         be provided at each intersection. As describe above in the section for
         SSD at signalized intersections, the SSD for design speeds of 50 and
         55 mph are 425 and 495 respectively. The results of the unsignalized
         ISD review are provided in Table 7.

         (5) Major Roadway Cross-Sectional Elements
         Surface Type
         The existing Route 31 surface types were ascertained through review
         of the record drawings obtained from NJDOT. The plans indicate that
         the roadway consists of a 2" Superpave Surface Course, 9"
         Superpave Base Course, 8" Dense Graded Aggregate, and 8'
         Subbase.
         Cross Slope
         The RDM (Sec. 5-02) indicates the roadway cross slope pavement
         should be at a minimum 1.5 percent.
         The available record plans for Route 31 shows the slopes along the
         roadway ranging from 1.5% to 4%.
         Lane Widths
         The RDM (Sec. 5-03) indicated that lane widths on land service
         highways should be no less than 11 feet. Based on record drawings




                                     15
NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


         and field observations, lane widths within the project limits meet or
         exceed the minimum set forth by the RDM.
         Shoulders
         The RDM (Sec. 5-04.2) indicates that shoulder widths on land service
         highways should not be less than eight (8) feet. Based on record
         drawings and field observations, there are no areas within the project
         limits that have shoulder widths which are below the 8 foot minimum
         set forth by the RDM.
         Roadside or Border
         The area between the roadway and the highway right of way is
         referred to as the roadside or border. Depending on the median,
         traveled way and shoulder widths, the roadside width is in the range
         of 70ft. for rural freeways and 25ft. for urban highways.
         The roadside/border width varies from 22' to 146' throughout the
         project limits.
         Curbs
         Based on visual inspection, the curb throughout the project limits
         appears to be in good condition. Those areas that do not have
         existing curb do show signs of runoff channel forming at the edge of
         pavement.
         Sidewalks
         Sidewalks are located at very few locations throughout the project
         area. The areas where sidewalks exist appear to be in good
         condition.
         Medians
         There are no existing medians within the project limits.
         Bridges
         There are no bridges within the project limits.

         (6) At-Grade Intersections (Signalized & Unsignalized)
         According to Figure 6-J (Sec. 6-04.1) of the roadway design manual,
         the minimum skew angle of an intersection is 60 degrees. For
         intersection skew angles of less than 60 degrees, channelization
         should be provided. The intersections along NJ Route 31 and their
         associated skew angles can be seen in Table 8.

          Prestige Plaza                               90°                 Yes


         Based on the information gathered from record drawings and
         documented in the above table, there are no deficient intersection
         skew angles within the project limits.

         (7) Interchanges
         There are no existing interchanges within the project limits.

         (8) Posted Speed Limits
         Within the project limits, the speed limit on Route 31 varies between
         45 mph (M.P. 23.84 ­ 24.40), and 50 mph (M.P. 24.40 ­ 25.13).

         (9) Clear Zone
         Within the project limits, NJ Route 31 traverses a predominately
         commercial area with a few residential areas mixed in. Given the
         design speed, roadside slope and design ADT, the clear zone may be
         determined. The clear zone for NJ Route 31 is 18-24 feet (Fig. 8-A)
         as per the RDM. Field observations revealed that, throughout the
         project study area along NJ Route 31, there are unprotected utility
         poles, road signs, signal poles, trees, and steep grade changes
         located within the clear zone.

         (10)    Guide Rail
         There is guide rail sporadically along both the northbound and
         southbound NJ Route 31 and appears to be in good condition.

         (11)   Hydraulic/Drainage
         Roadway
         NJ Route 31 has varying edge of road treatments throughout the
         project area. The edge of road varies back and forth between curbed
         sections and non-curbed sections.
         Waterways



                                       17
NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


         Several sub-watersheds of the Raritan River Watershed are within the
         project limits. There are six sub-watersheds including the (1) Raritan
         River at the roadway project northern limits, and crosses several
         Raritan River tributaries sequentially traveling south as follows: (2)
         unnamed tributary, (3) Assicong Creek, (4) Minneakoning Creek, (5)
         Bushkill Creek, and (6) Bushkill Brook. These streams are carried
         under NJ Route 31 by culverts which are located at M.P. 22.63
         (Structure No. 1012151 & 1012150), M.P. 23.14 (Structure No.
         1012152), M.P. 23.47 (Structure No. n/a), M.P. 23.95 (Structure No.
         1012153), M.P. 24.50 (Structure No. 1012154), M.P. 24.94 (Structure
         No. n/a), and M.P. 25.13 (Structure No. n/a).
         For the break-out project, sub-watershed areas include (1) Raritan
         River at the roadway project northern limits, and crosses several
         Raritan River tributaries sequentially traveling south as follows: (2)
         unnamed tributary, (3) Assicong Creek, and (4) Minneakoning Creek.

         (12)      Lighting
         Field visits to the project area revealed no issues with highway
         lighting. A review of the available crash reports did not indicate a
         crash problem due to poor highway lighting.

         (13)       Signing
         Field visits to the project area have revealed adequate signing within
         the project area, and signs appear to be in good condition.

         (14)      Pavement Markings
         Based on field observations, the existing pavement markings appear
         to be in good to average condition on the project roadways.

         (15)     Pavement Conditions
         Based on visual inspection for the break-out section the pavement
         condition was good to fair. The scope of work is anticipated to
         resurface and/or reconstruct pavements within the project limits.

         (16)      Access
         As part of the access review process, the existing conditions of the
         driveways were examined for compliance with provisions of the New
         Jersey State Highway Access Management Code, dated August
         2003. A copy of the applicable pages of the Access Management
         Code, indicating the Access Level (AL) and Desirable Typical Section
         (DTS), is included as Appendix E for the portion of Route 31 located
         within the project limits.
         The existing Route 31 corridor varies between a three lane to a five
         lane undivided sections with a two-way left turn lane.




                                     18
NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


         A review of the Access Code reveals that the DTS for this portion of
         Route 31 is a 4A and that the AL is 3 (M.P. 22.02 ­ 24.40) and 2
         (M.P. 24.40 ­ 30.26). A DTS of 4A specifies a section containing 4
         lanes, divided with shoulders or parking. An AL of 3 indicates right
         turn access with provision for left-turn access via jug handle and an
         AL of 2 indicates access along street or interchange only. The
         existing Route 31 does not satisfy this DTS throughout the entire
         project limits.
         The following indicates specific parcels which are in non-conformance
         with provisions of the Access Code:
         Edge clearance at lot lines
         Section 16:47-3.8(c) of the Access Code requires a minimum edge of
         clearance of 12 feet. This is measured from the extended lot line
         along the curbline to the beginning of the curbline opening. Several
         properties within the project limits have inadequate edge clearance
         (12') at the parcel boundary, including:
         Block 8, Lots 10,20,21
         Block 9, Lots 8,9,11,14,14.01,16,23
         Block 15, Lot 60
         Block 16, Lots 19, 22, 23
         Access point curb line opening
         Section 16:47-3.8(d) of the Access Code lists minimum and maximum
         curbline opening for residential and non-residential properties. The
         maximum allowable curbline opening for residential and non-
         residential properties is 30 feet and 50 feet respectively. There are no
         properties that are in non-conformance for curbline opening.
         Minimum Corner Clearance
         Section 16:47-3.8(k) of the Access Code lists the minimum corner
         clearance for signalized and unsignalized intersection. The corner
         clearance should be measured between the end of the curb return of
         the intersecting street and the beginning of the curb return or
         beginning of the depressed curb for the driveway. A minimum of 50
         feet for all driveways in the vicinity of unsignalized intersections is
         required as well as 100 feet for those driveways in the vicinity of a
         signalized intersection. All access points within the project limits fall
         within the above described criterion.

         (17)       Utilities
         The NJDOT, the county engineer and the township engineer were
         contacted to ascertain the names of the utility companies, which have
         facilities within the project limits. The utility companies and their
         corresponding contact information can be seen in Table 9.

         (18)       Jurisdiction
         The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) currently has
         jurisdiction over NJ Route 31. Hunterdon County currently has
         jurisdiction over CR 600 (Wescott Dr.), CR 652 (Gauntt Pl.), and CR
         612 (Bartles Corner Rd./Sand Hill Rd.). All remaining intersecting
         roads within the project limits are under the jurisdiction of Raritan
         Township or are private driveways.

         (19)     Pedestrian/Bicycle Compatibility
         Pedestrian
         A review of the NJDOT Pedestrian Compatible Planning and Design
         Guidelines was conducted in the evaluation of this project. These
         guidelines indicate that for a facility with a posted speed of 40 mph or
         a truck, bus, or recreational vehicle percentage over 5%, paved
         shoulder widths beyond 4 feet are desirable and should be considered
         for the pedestrian compatibility requirements. The portion of NJ
         Route 31 within the project limits contains a shoulder width of at least
         4 feet. This portion of NJ Route 31 is therefore compatible.
         Bicycle
         A review of the NJDOT Pedestrian Compatible Planning and Design
         Guidelines was conducted in the evaluation of this project. These
         guidelines indicate that for a facility with an Average Annual Daily
         Traffic (ADDT) over 10,000 or a truck percentage over 5%, a posted
         speed of 40mph, and located within an urban area, the bicycle
         compatibility requirements would necessitate a 4 foot shoulder. Also
         it is noted that where possible, NJDOT minimum shoulder width of 8
         feet should be provided on roadways having an ADDT greater than
         10,000 vehicles.
         The portion of NJ Route 31 within the project limits is compatible.

NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


          (20)      ITS
          ITS facilities do exist within the project area per discussion with
          NJDOT ITS unit during the Route 31 CD study. The facilities exist on
          the southbound side of Route 31 and should not be impacted by this
          project.

          (21)     Landscape
          The landscape in the vicinity of NJ Route 31 consists of mostly grass
          frontage areas.

     f.   Existing Structure(s) Inventory & Deficiencies

          (1) Structures and Bridges
          There are no existing structures or bridges within the limits of the
          project. Refer to subsection (e) Culverts for culvert information.

          (2) Noise Walls
          There are no existing noise walls within the project limits.

          (3) Retaining Walls
          There are no existing retaining walls within the project limits.

          (4) Sign Structures
          There are no existing sign structures within the project limits.

          (5) Culverts
          During the Route 31 Section 6D project, culverts within the project
          limits were improved. Within the study area, there are three culverts.
          Of the three culverts one qualifies to be ranked based on NJDOT
          criteria (20 foot span, highway carrying). This structure (structure
          number 1012154, built in 2005) has a priority ranking 5 - the lowest. It
          is in very good to excellent condition. The remaining two structures
          within the project limits are not ranked as they are less than 20 feet

5. Traffic Data

     a. Existing Traffic Conditions
     Within the project area, there are four signalized intersections and two un-
     signalized intersections. The number of travel lanes ranges from two to
     five. Currently, there are excessive delays and queues at a number of
     intersections, as well as at lane drop locations.
     Traffic counts and field observations were conducted to help understand
     the traffic flow characteristics and problematic traffic operations. Field
     observations consisted of queuing and safety concerns, signal operations,




                                     21
NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


     and detailed intersection geometry sketches including lane configurations,
     pavement markings, pedestrian feasibility, signage, and local land use.

     b. Capacity and Level of Service of Existing Conditions
     In addition to the studies performed in the field, the simulation software
     Synchro/SimTraffic was used to perform existing traffic operations
     analyses. The SimTraffic model simulates individual vehicular movements
     and congestion-related issues such as the effect of spillback and blocking
     at adjacent intersections providing detailed Levels of Service for each
     intersection within the study area. The traffic simulation model was
     developed and calibrated so that it represented a reasonably accurate
     portrayal of observed existing conditions.
     Traffic volumes on NJ Route 31 range between 20,000 to 25,000 ADT.
     The signalized intersections along the study corridor are located at
     Minneakoning Road, Wescott Drive, Bartles Corner Road and Prestige
     Plaza. The NJDOT Congestion Management System ranks the two
     corridor links from Medium to High priority with (v/c) ratios of 0.96 and
     1.03. These v/c ratios indicate a priority ranking of 8 and 17 out of 167 as
     far as congested links within the county.
     Tables 10 and 11 provide the LOS results by approach for each
     signalized intersections in the project study area.

     As can be seen in the tables, the intersections with Bartles Corner Road
     and Minneakoning Road are operating at or over capacity during the PM
     peak hour with average vehicle delays on northbound NJ Route 31
     exceeding two minutes at Minneakoning Road. In fact, the average delay
     is likely worse than reported since the queue on NJ Route 31 Northbound
     frequently extends from Minneakoning Road through the intersection with
     Walter Foran Boulevard.

     c. Crash Analysis
     The NJDOT, Bureau of Safety Programs provided database crash
     summary data for the corridor for the period January 1, 2004 to December
     31, 2006. The corridor was divided by cross-section and compared to
     statewide averages for similar roadway types. Table 12 shows the crash
     summary information.
                Table 12: NJDOT Bureau of Safety Systems Crash Data

       25.13       shoulder



     The larger section, MP 23.51 to MP 24.73, has a crash rate that far
     excess the statewide average for roadways with similar cross-sections.
     More detailed crash information is provided in Appendix K.
     In order to examine the crash information in more detail, crash reports
     were requested and received from Raritan Township Police Department
     for the period November 2004 to November 2007, which corresponds with
     completion of the NJ Route 31 Section 6D construction project.             A
     comprehensive crash analysis was completed for NJ Route 31 within the
     project limits using this data. The corridor was divided into three sections
     based on post-construction cross-sections. The results of the analysis are
     provided in Table 13. More detailed information is provided in Appendix
     K.

          Similar to the crash analysis completed for the 2004 to 2006 data, the
          area of Route 31 between Walter Foran Blvd and Health Quest Blvd far
          exceeds the statewide average crash rate for similar cross-section the
          section of Route 31 between Wescott Drive and Health Quest Blvd. nearly
          twice the state average.

C.   Project Description
     1. Project Fact Sheet
     A project fact sheet was created for the Core Group Meeting that took place at
     NJDOT on October 2, 2009. It should be noted that the alternatives for this
     report have been modified since the Core Group Meeting, thus alternative
     headings may not agree between the two documents. The project fact sheet
     can be found in Appendix C (Project Fact Sheet).

     2. Restatement of Project Need
     Based on the analysis of existing conditions, the following needs have been
     identified:
     Improve Safety
     The current roadway configuration of northbound Route 31 at Minneakoning
     Road creates an undesirable traffic condition. Additionally, there is a high rate
     of crashes along the corridor compared to state averages with a concentration
     of the crashes occurring at the signalized intersections, lane drop locations
     and merge points.
     Reduce Current and Future Congestion and Delay
     Currently, there are excessive delays and queuing at the intersections of NJ
     Route 31 with Minneakoning Road and Bartles Corner Road, as well as at the
     lane drop locations where travel lanes reduce from two per direction to one per
     direction. These conditions are projected to significantly deteriorate as
     approved, anticipated and future development occurs in and around the
     corridor.

 3. Project Methodology
 A four-step process was used to prepare this analysis. First, the existing
 conditions were established for the study area. Project needs were then
 identified from the baseline condition. Next, alternatives were developed based
 on addressing the project needs. Measures of effectiveness were developed to
 select a recommended IPA. Finally, an impact assessment was performed to
 determine the cost/benefits of the IPA.

 4. Project Design Standards
 The design standards and controls utilized in the design of the improvement
 alternatives consist of the following (Table 14):

    II Alternatives Analysis
           A total of four (4) alternatives were developed to address the project needs of the
           study area. The goals of the improvement alternatives are the following:
                        · Improve safety
                        · Reduce current and future congestion and delay
           Illustrations of each of the alternatives have been provided in Appendix L.

           A.     Development of Alternatives
           Four alternatives were prepared for the Feasibility Assessment portion of the
           project. The alternatives differ in the length of the widening of northbound Route 31
           with Alternative 1 being the shortest and Alternative 3 being the longest.

                  1. Alternative 1
                  Alternative 1 proposes improvements along the northbound side of Route 31
                  from the intersection at Minneakoning Road (Sta. 1258+00.00) through the
                  intersection at Wescott Drive tying back into existing shortly after the
                  intersection (Sta. 1282+50.00). The length of the project is approximately
                  2450 feet. The proposed typical section consists of two twelve foot (12') thru
                  lanes and a four foot (4') shoulder. The typical section will transition back to
                  the existing one twelve foot (12') thru lane and ten foot (10') shoulder.
                  This alternative will involve no R.O.W. impacts. Due to the widening of the
                  roadway there will be 8,960 square feet of additional impervious area and
                  4,443 square feet of disturbed area due to the construction footprint.
                  Traffic analysis results for Alternative 1 are provided in Tables 15 and 16.

                The results indicate that the improvements proposed as part of Alternative 1
                would improve the overall level of service and delay at the intersection of
                Route 31 and Minneakoning Rd. However, the results also indicate that the
                other signalized intersections would deteriorate in LOS and delay in the PM
                Peak Hour. In other words, the congestion and delay would "shift" from
                Minneakoning Road to Bartles Corner Road and Wescott Drive.
                Based on a preliminary cost estimate, the construction costs for Alternative 1
                are projected to be $1.0 Million.
                Table 17 illustrates the advantages and disadvantages for this alternative.

                 Addresses key safety issue at                   Adversely impacts the LOS/Delay at other

                 No ROW impact

                 Limited widening needed


                While Alternative 1 would address the key safety issue on Route 31 at
                Minneakoning Road it has significant impacts to the other signalized
                intersections in the project area. Essentially, it shifts problems "down the road"
                to the next intersections.

                 2. Alternatives 2 and 2A
                 Alternative 2 proposes improvements to the northbound side of Route 31 from
                 the intersection of Route 31 at Minneakoning Road (Sta. 1258+00.00) to the
                 intersection of Route 31 and Healthquest Blvd. (1296+75.00). The length of
                 the project is approximately 3875 feet. The proposed typical section consists
                 of two twelve foot (12') thru lanes and a four foot (4') shoulder that transitions
                 back to the existing cross section of one twelve foot (12') thru lane and a ten
                 foot (10') shoulder.
                 This alternative will involve several R.O.W. impacts which include a permanent
                 drainage easement (490 ft2), permanent Utility Easement (1796 ft2), and a
                 temporary Construction Easement (1305 ft2). Due to the widening of the
                 roadway there will be 13,958 square feet of additional impervious area and
                 9,458 square feet of disturbed area due to the construction footprint.

As can be seen in the tables, Alternative 2 shows a significantly improved
overall LOS and Delay as compared to the existing conditions for the
intersections of Route 31 and Minneakoning Rd, Wescott Drive, and Bartles
Corner Road with the intersections operating at LOS C or better during both
peak hours. There is a slight increase in the delay at Prestige Plaza which
continues to operate well at LOS B.
Based on a preliminary cost estimate, the construction costs for Alternative 2
are projected to be $1.3 Million.
Table 20 illustrates the advantages and disadvantages for this alternative.

                                              Substandard transition

                                              Delays will quickly escalate on Route 31 at
                                              Prestige Plaza if anticipated development
                                              occurs


Alternative 2 addresses the immediate need at Minneakoning Road and does
not significantly impact the LOS or delay at the other signalized intersection in
the study area. However, there were two key concerns that remained with this
alternative. First, the transitioning of the roadway back to existing is
substandard. The transitioning occurs near Health Quest Boulevard and it
was determined that it would be best to transition prior to the intersection as
oppose to providing a standard length transition with part of the transitioning
occurring through the intersection of Route 31 and Health Quest Blvd.
Second, there was a concern that the favorable LOS conditions for northbound
Route 31 at Prestige Plaza, based on the 2007 traffic volumes, could rapidly
deteriorate if anticipated development at the Plaza occurs.
Alternative 2A was developed to address the substandard transition and is
identical to Alternative 2 except for how it ties back into the existing condition.
Alternative 2a meets the existing condition at the point where the right turn
only lane starts for the Prestige Plaza shopping center (Sta. 1303+00.00). The
length of the project would be extended to approximately 4500 feet.           This
method of tying back into the existing condition meets NJDOT standards.
Though the proposed limits of Alternative 2A are different than those of




                                       29
NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


Alternative 2, there would be no significant change in LOS or delay. Due to
the lengthening of the project limits, there would be an increase in the
Construction Easement to a total of 2025 ft2. Due to the widening of the
roadway there will be a total of 16,812 ft2 of additional impervious area and
13,172 ft2 of disturbed area due to the construction footprint.
Based on a preliminary cost estimate, the construction costs for Alternative 2A
are projected to be $1.6 Million.
Table 21 illustrates the advantages and disadvantages for Alternative 2A.

                                             Larger construction foot print which leads to

                                             Thru lane "ends" as a right-turn only lane

                                             Delays will quickly escalate on Route 31 at
                                             Prestige Plaza if anticipated development
                                             occurs


Alternative 2A meets the needs of the project with minimal impacts and without
a substandard transition. However there were two concerns with this
alternative. First, it was felt that "dropping" the second through lane at the
Prestige Plaza where the right-turn lane starts would create a similar situation
to the current issue at Route 31 and Minneakoning Rd. Second, similar to
Alternative 2, this alternative does not have much flexibility in capacity at the
intersection of Route 31 and Prestige Plaza, so conditions on Route 31 could
quickly deteriorate if anticipated development occurs at Prestige Plaza.

3. Alternative 3
Alternative 3 involves proposed improvements to the northbound side of Route
31 from the intersection of Route 31 at Minneakoning Road (Sta. 1258+00.00)
through the intersection of Route 31 and the Prestige Plaza shopping center
(1316+00.00). The length of the project would be extended to approximately
5800 feet. The proposed typical section consists of two twelve foot (12') thru
lanes and a four foot (4') shoulder. The typical section then transitions back to
the existing cross section of one twelve foot (12') thru lane and an eight foot
(8') shoulder.

                This alternative will involve several R.O.W. impacts which include a permanent
                drainage easement (490 ft2), permanent Utility Easement (1796 ft2), and a
                temporary Construction Easement (2025 ft2). Due to the widening of the
                roadway there will be 20,000 ft2 of additional impervious area and 15,981 ft2 of
                disturbed area due to the construction footprint.

                Similar to Alternative 2 and 2A, Alternative 3 shows a significantly improved
                overall LOS and Delay as compared to existing conditions for the intersections
                of Route 31 and Minneakoning Rd, Wescott Drive, and Bartles Corner Rd.
                Unlike Alternatives 2 and 2A, Alternative 3 does not increase delay at Prestige
                Plaza, which continues to operate well at LOS B.
                Based on a preliminary cost estimate, the construction costs for Alternative 3
                are projected to be $1.8 Million.
                Table 24 illustrates the advantages and disadvantages for this alternative.

 Alternative 3 meets the needs of the project with minimal impacts, and
 acceptable LOS and delay at all intersections. Additionally, Alternative 3
 addresses the concerns expressed about Alternatives 2 and 2A as the second
 thru lane continues through the intersection of Prestige Plaza and Route 31.

 4. Alternatives Summary
 The four alternatives were evaluated based on their ability to meet the project
 needs, their impacts to the existing conditions and capital costs. Based on the
 advantages and disadvantages, each alternative addresses the needs to
 certain levels. The determination was that the gains afforded by Alternative 3
 outweighed the impacts of extending the project limits beyond the intersection
 with Prestige Plaza.
 To capture the traffic results in a relative manner, Tables 25 and 26 contain
 an improvement comparison of the LOS and Delay for existing conditions to
 the alternatives for the AM and PM Peak Hours, respectively. The results
 indicate that without widening through the intersection of Route 31 and Bartles
 Corner Rd. (Alternative 2) increased delays will remain at the intersections of
 Route 31 and Minneakoning Rd, Wescott Drive, and Bartles Corner Rd in the
 PM Peak Hour for the existing 2007 traffic volumes.

III The Initially Preferred Alternative
   A.   Written Discussion of Proposed Alternative
   The IPA selected for this project is Alternative 3. Alternative 3 addresses the
   project needs while providing more flexibility than Alternatives 2 and 2A and
   addressing the design concerns/issues of those alternatives. The IPA involves
   proposed improvements to the northbound side of Route 31 from the intersection of
   Route 31 at Minneakoning Road (Sta. 1258+00.00) through the intersection of
   Route 31 and the Prestige Plaza shopping center (1316+00.00). The length of the
   project would approximately 5800 feet. The proposed typical section consists of two
   twelve foot (12') thru lanes and a four foot (4') shoulder. The typical section then
   transitions back to the existing cross section of one twelve foot (12') thru lane and
   an eight foot (8') shoulder.
   Due to the widening of the roadway there will be 20,000 ft2 of additional impervious
   area and 15,981 ft2 of disturbed area due to the construction footprint.
   Based on a preliminary cost estimate, the construction costs for the IPA are
   projected to be $1.8 Million. It should be noted that there are utility cost associated
   with the IPA which may increase based upon the final construction layout. There is
   a sewer line relocation associated with the IPA and at the time of this report a
   decision on who is responsible for the relocation has yet to be determined. This
   item could potentially increase the costs above the estimate of $1.8 Million.
   The IPA has been illustrated graphically in Appendix M.

   B.   Geometrics (Proposed Roadway)
   The horizontal and vertical alignments for the project were designed to adhere to
   the minimum requirements set forth in the RDM while minimizing impacts to existing
   properties. The project form for the Controlling Substandard Design Elements
   along Route 31 has been included in Appendix N.
   Horizontal Alignment
   There are no changes or modification to the horizontal alignment of Route 31 in the
   IPA.
   Vertical Alignment
   There are no changes or modification to the vertical alignment of Route 31 in the
   IPA.
   Typical Section
   The typical section throughout the IPA consists of two northbound lanes varying
   between 11' and 12' with a minimum 4' outside shoulder.

   C.   Discussion of Right of Way Impacts
   There are limited R.O.W. impacts associated with the IPA. They include a
   permanent drainage easement (490 ft2), permanent Utility Easement (1796 ft2),




                                             34
     NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


and a temporary Construction Easement (2025 ft2). A summary of the anticipated
right-of-way impacts associated with each parcel as a result of the improvements
proposed under the IPA has been provided in Appendix O of this document.

D.   Structural Design
There are no proposed structures within the limits of the project.

E.   Discussion of Access Impacts
The IPA impacts 13 driveways (13 adjustments) within the project limits. A
summary of the access impacts associated with each parcel as a result of the
improvements proposed under the IPA has been provided in Appendix P of this
document.

F.   Traffic Engineering
The proposed IPA does not necessitate changing the phasing at study area
intersections, although it is designed to provide adequate capacity if in the future
protected-only left-turn movements from Route 31 onto the side streets are
required.
Although the project is intended to be a "quick fix", the IPA was simulated with
future year volumes to determine its approximate lifespan. Horizon years of 2010,
2020 and 2035 were analyzed in Synchro/SimTraffic where a 1.0% average annual
compounded growth rate was applied to the 2007 existing volumes. The growth
rate was based on North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority (NJTPA)
demographic forecasts for Hunterdon County and Raritan Township which extend
to 2030. To account for future shopping center development at the Prestige Plaza
development, 130 vehicles (65 in/65 out) were added to the intersection of Route 31
and Prestige Plaza during the PM Peak Hour for all three horizon year scenarios.
Tables 27 and 28 show the results of the traffic analysis and indicate that the IPA
will operate at LOS D or better at all intersections for the 2010 and 2020 scenarios.
The analysis shows that some of the intersections are projected to operate at failing
conditions by 2035. It is worth noting that the northbound Route 31 movement is
not projected to fail for any time period.

            G. Proposed Staging
            Construction staging concepts have been considered for the IPA for this project. It
            appears that the traffic can be maintained through the work area, without the use of
            detour routes during construction of the improvements proposed under the IPA.




                                                     36
     NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


The work can be completed in two stages.              The major items of work to be
completed in each stage are described below:
Stage 1
Traffic
Traffic on Route 31 will maintain its current pattern with the northbound lanes being
restricted by temporary traffic control devices.
Construction
Widening and full depth construction can be completed along the outside edge of
Route 31 northbound.
Stage 2
Traffic
Traffic on Route 31 can be shifted onto the newly constructed pavement.
Construction
Resurfacing of the existing northbound lane will be completed during this phase.

H.   Utilities
As proposed in the IPA, the widening of the Route 31 would affect some of the
aerial utilities in the project area as well as signal equipment at certain intersections.
There are also inlets and manholes that would need to be relocated or reset to fit
the proposed condition.

I.   Drainage/Stormwater Management
This breakout project has several relatively small improvements over approximately
a one mile stretch of road, associated with four separate sub-drainage areas. The
added impervious coverage per sub-drainage area is individually less than 0.25
acres, but collectively more than 0.25 acres over the collective four sub-drainage
areas.
There are limited areas to implement compensatory stormwater controls due to right
of way limitations, and there is economy of scale in managing stormwater at
suitable and available sites where feasible. If necessary, compensatory water
quality controls in one sub-watershed may compensate for deficiency in another
sub-watershed under certain conditions. We have identified one location within the
right of way and sufficiently off set 50-feet from an adjacent stream, to comply with
the Riparian Zone requirements, which can manage about 0.44 acres of impervious
coverage off-setting the various improvements over this one mile road segment.
The figure titled Detention BMP Concept (Refer to Appendix R) shows the
prospective BMP Basin location, adjacent to the Wescott Drive and Route 31
intersection, including contours associated with three basins in series that has the
capacity to manage the contributing flow.
The runoff generated was modeled to enter a series of basis with a gabion wall to
limit disturbance within the existing right of way, and a gabion spillway to detain and

       NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


release water as a conventional detention basin. The preliminary analysis shows
that the basin has sufficient capacity to detain and manage the contributing runoff
with the following resulting reduction in peak flows. See Table 29 and Appendix R.
Table 29: Pre and Post Peak Flow Rate Summary, Preliminary Assessment

           Storm Event              1 yr          2 yr         10 yr         100 yr


     Pre-development (cfs)         1.233          1.50         2.227         3.589


     Post-development (cfs)        0.058         0.087         0.294         1.932




J.     Geotechnical Engineering
Geotechnical investigations of the project area were limited to the review of the
existing data.

K.     Survey/Base Plans
Base mapping for this project was developed utilizing scanned aerial photographs,
as built record plans, and a field survey. The scanned aerial photography was then
imported into the project design file utilizing CADD software and matched to fit the
topographic information gathered from the field survey.

L.     Pedestrian and Bicycle Compatibility
Pedestrian
A review of the NJDOT Pedestrian Compatible Planning and Design Guidelines
was conducted in the evaluation of this project. These guidelines indicate that for a
facility with a posted speed of 40 mph or a truck, bus, or recreational vehicle
percentage over 5%, paved shoulder widths beyond 4 feet are desirable and should
be considered for the pedestrian compatibility requirements. The portion of NJ
Route 31 within the project limits contains a shoulder width of at least 4 feet. This
portion of NJ Route 31 is therefore compatible.
Bicycle
The portion of NJ Route 31 within the project limits contains at least a 4 foot
shoulder. Therefore, this portion of NJ Route 31 is compatible.

M. Context Sensitive Design
There are no Context Sensitive Design items on this project.

N.     Environment
This section of Route 31 was reconstructed as part of the Route 31 Section 6D
project which included Categorical Exclusion level documentation. Following
coordination with internal NJDOT Environmental Staff, the determination was made



                                            38
        NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza


    that an environmental screening was unnecessary due to the previous CED efforts
    combined with the environmental coordination associated with the Flemington
    Bypass and South Branch Parkway Projects.
    The anticipated level of documentation will be CED.

   O. Coordination with Stakeholders
    As part of the process of selecting the IPA, DPD sought input from both internal and
    external stakeholders through presentations and meetings. The project was
    presented to the NJDOT Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) at a Core Group Meeting
    on (09/24/09) and during follow-up meetings with smaller groups of SMEs to deal
    with specific issues. The project was presented to the Raritan Township Local
    Officials in June of 2009. The project was also presented to the Public Information
    Center (PIC) on 12/14/09. A copy of the meeting minutes from the Core Group
    Meeting and summary of the comments received during the PIC are provided in
    Appendix B
    During the PIC, there was a discussion regarding the lack of a right-turn lane in the
    NB direction for the IPA into the BJ's driveway (at Wescott Drive) access. Cyzner
    Properties (Irv Cyzner) indicated that he owned parcels on either side of the
    driveway. He indicated that the lack of a NB right-turn lane would adversely affect
    his tenants. In response to the questions raised, NJDOT evaluated the traffic
    operations with and without a NB right-turn lane. The results of the analysis
    indicated that the addition of a NB right-turn lane would have little impact on the
    operations. A copy of the analysis is provided in Appendix B.
    Coordination efforts are on-going with Cyzner Properties. It is anticipated that this
    issue will be resolved during final design.
    A copy of the Township's Resolution of Support has been provided in Appendix Q.

IV Summary of Key Issues and Critical Problems
With the advancement of this project into Preliminary Design, the following is a
summary of key issues and critical problems which require further investigation in the
Preliminary Design Phase.
           · Further coordination with Utility companies regarding their facilities and
             potential impacts associated with the IPA.
           · R.O.W. impacts due to IPA require further investigation in addition to
             negotiating with property owners.
           · Obtain approved CED
No fatal flaws have been identified. A design exception for shoulder width is planned
and has been coordinated with NJDOT Subject Matter Experts for their concurrence.

V Scope of Work Summary
The list of anticipated tasks for design include:
 Activity Number   Description

       1010        Project Initiation
       1030        Designer Mobilization
       1085        Analyze and Approve Substandard Design Elements
                   In order to obtain Federal and Department approvals, a project must either conform
                   to the appropriate design standards or have approved design exceptions. Design
                   Exceptions may be approved when it can be demonstrated that compliance with the
                   standard will cause severe social, economic and/or environmental impacts and that
                   the Design Exceptions are in the interest of the Department, the traveling public and
                   the Community.

                   The design exception report is comprised of three parts: a list of all CSDEs by
                   location number and station/milepost, a checklist of the impacts to meet the
                   standard value, and a table(s) containing a description of the CSDE including the
                   standard design value, the proposed safety measures, accident analysis, and the
                   impacts.

                   Once the review of all the initial geometrics has been completed, the final Design
                   Exception report should be developed in consultation with the Project Manager and
                   submitted to Director, Division of Design Services

       1110        Establish Utility Engineering Funding
                   Upon completion of the initial contacts, a preliminary engineering cost estimate is
                   to be developed and a funding source is to be established by the NJDOT Utilities
                   Coordinator.
                   This effort requires, but is not limited to the following tasks:
                       · Obtain preliminary design information and probable utility conflicts from
                           the designer

STIP Conformity
Volume II ­ Section II of the Fiscal Year 2010 to 2019 STIP list Route 31, Church Street
to River Road (DB#08327) for PD in FY10. The Route 31 Northbound, Minneakoning
Road to M.P. 24.73 Project (DB# 08327A) was designated for advancement out of
parent project and was initiated after the STIP was finalized. This year's DRAFT STIP
lists Route 31 Northbound, Minneakoning Road to M.P. 24.73 (DB# 08327A) for $1.2 M
CON (DEMO) in FY11. The DES will be funded primarily through a State funded Term
Agreement consultant in FY10 and FY11.

VI Social, Economic and Environmental Considerations
  A.       Project Benefits
  The project will improve the northbound segment of NJ Route 31 from
  Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza, specifically addressing the safety and
  congestion concerns identified through the efforts that occurred during the Concept
  Development phase of the NJDOT Project Delivery Process.

  B.       Negative Impacts
  The completion of this project will generate a negative impact during construction
  on the traveling public who uses NJ Route 31 and some minor impacts to the
  surrounding environment. In the case of this project, both have been addressed
  during the scoping process and should be minimized moving forward to design.

  C.       Public Involvement
  Through the process, an open communication has been developed between the
  township and the NJDOT. As the project moves forward through design, this
  relationship should be maintained.

  D.       Environmental Constraints
  This section of Route 31 was reconstructed as part of the Route 31 Section 6D
  project which included Categorical Exclusion level documentation. Following
  coordination with internal NJDOT Environmental Staff, the determination was made
  that an environmental screening was unnecessary due to the previous CED efforts
  combined with the environmental coordination associated with the Flemington
  Bypass and South Branch Parkway Projects.
  Consultation with SHPO was completed on 10/20/09 for the current CED effort.
  The anticipated level of documentation will be CED.



VII Preliminary Cost Estimates for Project Development
  The following are preliminary cost estimates for planning, scoping and design
  development:
       ·     Planning (100k ­ CD for entire Route 31 from Church Street to River Road
       ·     Scoping (estimate 150k for the "breakout")
       ·     Design Development (800k)

Public Information Notes
On December 14, 2009 a Public Information Center was held from 4pm to 7pm at the Raritan
Township Municipal Center (Police Conference Rood) to answer residents and business owners'
questions about the proposed improvements along Route 3 1 .

There were a total of six (6) residents/business owners who attended. Most of the questions
asked were general in nature about the project (ROW, project limits, etc.). The following is a list
of concerns that were expressed:

    1. Irv Cyzner (Cyzner Properties) indicated he owns the two parcels just north of BJ' sand
         BJ's parking lot. He's concerned (i.e., his tenants) about losing the exclusive northbound
         right-tum lane into BJ's. Basically he said he would get lawyers involved if    we did not,
         although he was very wiling to work with us to accommodate a right tum lane.

          Mr. Cyzner indicated we should talk to Gary Dean to discuss Irv's and the tenants
          Traffc Concerns

    2. Richard Stothoff asked about whether there were any impacts along the southbound side
         of Route 31. He owns a offce bldg near the intersection of Minneakoning Road and
         Route 31. The site has access to both Route 31 and Minneakoning Road. We indicated
         that the southbound side of Route 31 would not be affected

The following project information was provided by attendees:

    · George Dilts indicated the SW lot at the corner of     Bartles Comer Rd and Rt 31 is
         available. He indicated that two lots closest to Healtquest Blvd. on the northbound side
         (past HQ Blvd) wil be used for a Sonics (approved). George indicated that NJDOT
         access has supposedly approved the access (RIIRO) for Starbucks.

   · George/Jack Cust indicated that there are future plans for a Restaurant (Diner), Retail,
         and a apartment bldg (42 units - 3 story). Part of   CO   A

   · Other attendees asked general project related questions. There were a total of six (6)
       residents/business owners who attended.

                                            MEETING SUMMARY

SUBJECT:             Core Group Meeting

DATE:                October 2, 2009

TIME:                i :30 P.M. - 2:30 P.M.

LOCATION:           NJDOT Conference Room 4A

PRESENT:             See Attached Attendance List



   Meeting Purpose:
   The purpose of the meeting was to present to Core Group members project information for the
   following two (2) NJ Route 31 projects in the Division of Project Development and to seek Core
   Group members input on key project issues.

           . NJ Route 31 Church Street (MP 22.21) to the Raritan River Crossing (MP 25.13)
               - Feasibilty Assessment
           . NJ Route 31 Minneakoning Road (MP 23.84) to the signalized intersection at
              the Stop & Shop (24.73) - Breakout Project

   Meeting Summary:
   John Molé (DPD) provided a brief project overview and history for those in attendance, and then
   Scott Diehl and Bill McGarrigel (Urban Engineers) presented a PowerPoint presentation
   covering both projects. The presentation was divided into four sections (Project Background,
   Design Sections 1-4, Breakout Project and Action Items).

   Project Background:
   The first section covered included the project history, project purpose and need, and crash and
   traffic analysis, and included the following key items:
        Project History
        . The Route 31 project was a result of 2007 problem statement that identified an
           operation an safety issue between East Main S1. and Church Street
Minutes of Meeting

    . Through additional studies and coordination with the local municipalities and county, the
         project area was expanded to include Route 31 between Church Street and the
         southern end of the dualized section of Route 31. Concept Development (CD) for this
         expanded project area was completed in the fall of 2008.

    . In January 2009, Raritan Township submitted a letter to the Commissioner indicating
         that the current roadway configuration of northbound Route 31 at Minneakoning creates
         "a dangerous traffic pattern". The Township's Police Chief said "the abrupt termination
         of the merge lane at the Minneakoning intersection is dangerous and unacceptable. It's
         an invitation for disaster.

    . Following an investigation by the Division of Project Development (DPD), CPC approved
        a break-out project from the overall study to address the issues identified by Raritan
        Township.

    Purpose and Need
    . The overall purpose of the Route 31 FA project is to improve safety conditions and
        reduce existing and projected congestion and delay along the corridor. The proposed
         breakout project has the same project purpose with a focus at addressing the issues at
         Minneakoning Road.

    Management System
    . The project area contains two links or sections ranked "high" in the congestion
         management database. Both sections have a vIc ratio above 1.0 with a overall score
         ;;7.0 on the management system. The two high sections are ranked 4th and 6th
         respectively in Hunterdon County.

    Crash Analysis
    . Crash analyses were completed for NJ Route 31 within the project limits using crash
        data collected from November 2004-November 2007. There were over 300 crashes
         with the project area during the three-year analysis period with three sections having
         crash rates exceeding statewide averages.

    Traffc Analysis
    . The Traffic Analysis results for existing conditions showed there are excessive delays
         and queues at the intersections of NJ Route 31 with Walter Foran Boulevard,
         Minneakoning Road and Bartles Corner Road, as well as at the lane drop locations
         where travel lanes reduce from two per direction to one per direction.

    . The table for projected 2035 future conditions showed that operations are expected to
         significantly deteriorate as anticipated and future development occurs in and around the
         corridor. Most intersections along the corridor will operate at Level of Service F (LOS F)
         with significant queuing throughout the corridor.

    . The last table presented for the traffc analysis showed the results for the build
       conditions. The build conditions assume two (2) travel lanes per direction on Route 31

          with a center/left turn lane throughout the corridor. The analysis results show that the
          signalized intersections along the corridor would operate at LOS E or better during both
          peak hours.


Design Sections:
The meeting progressed to discuss the design sections, and included the following key items:

    . The project was divided into the following four sections:
           o Section 1 (MP 22.21 to 23.14): North of Church Street to North of East Main
                     Street
             o Section 2 (MP 23.14 to 23.84): North of East Main Street to South of
                     Minneakoning Road
             o Section 3 (MP 23.84 to 24.73): South of Minneakoning Road to Prestige Plaza
                     (Stop n' Shop)
             o Section 4 (MP 24.73 to 25.13): Prestige Plaza to the southern end of the
                     dualized section of Route 31

    . For each section, Urban explained the primary issues that will affect the design by
          section and through the project limits. This was followed with a list of design decision
          priorities:
             o Access - Strict Application of the Access Code or Apply Modifications and
                Adjustments
             o Design Exceptions - Yes or No
             o Right of Way Impacts - Yes or No
             o Project Advancement - One Project or Several Projects
             o Drainage Design & Utilities - Modify Existing or Mostly New

          The bold text represents Urban's and DPD's current/general approach to these design
          decisions. Urban then presented more detail about each decision priority.

    Access
    The three primary access items considered in the corridor were minimum corner clearance,
    edge clearance at lot lines, and access point curbline openings. Urban indicated that the
    previous project did well to address the access concerns in the corridor. At present the
    corridor has no issue in terms of minimum corner clearance. There are 20 lots in non-
    conformance for edge clearance, and one lot in non-conformance in terms of access point
    curbline opening.

    The expectation is to advance the design with access adjustments and if necessary
    consider modifications. There is no expectation for revocations at this time. This was
    determined to be acceptable. If there was a change to this progression, the Project Team
    would anticipate scheduling a review meeting for discussion.

    Design Exceptions
    Urban is currently advancing two alternatives, Alternative 1 will meet the minimum design
    criteria and Alternative 2 will balance the impacts by considering design exceptions.

Miniites of Meeting

    Presently the item that will require consideration of a design exception is shoulder width.
    We expect to advance Alternative 1 with an 8' Shoulder and Alternative 2 with a 4' Shoulder
    at this time. If the need to consider additional design exceptions occurs, the Project Team
    would anticipate scheduling a review meeting for discussion.

    Right-of-Way (ROW) Impacts
    Urban explained that ROW impacts are expected at this time. The full magnitude of the
    impacts is not determined. Our expectations are to make balanced decisions that best
    address the needs of NJDOT and the community. Upon developing enough detail
    regarding the impacts, we anticipate providing the information to NJDOT for cost estimating
    purposes. This was determined to be acceptable. If there was a change to this progression,
    the Project Team would anticipate scheduling a review meeting for discussion.

    Project Advancement
    Urban explained that the corridor has been divided into four sections to serve as project
    delineation. Advancing or breaking-up the larger project into sections allows for:
    Prioritization, Deferred Cost, and Potential Cost Sharing Opportunities. However, there are
    potential complications including: Inconvenience to public and businesses, and limited
    improvement. It was noted by a core group member that there's also the possibility of
    overlapping projects if a project falls behind schedule. In general core group members
    thought it would be preferred to advance the project in one piece.

    Drainage Design
    Urban explained the present complications associated with advancing a drainage design
    concept. At conflict are the existing drainage system, the existing underground utilities and
    the anticipated widening. Advancing the design will necessitate some significant procedural
    decisions. The recently completed project required a thorough coordination of the drainage
    system and the underground utilities. It will be necessary for the project team to establish if
    the priority is to preserve the majority of the existing drainage system and minimize change
    or if is best to create and generally new drainage system which requires substantial impact
    and coordination. The trade off is that preserving the existing system will mean that
    manholes may exist in the future travel lane. Discussion on this topic provided direction for
    advancement. The Project Team will develop a schematic design that preserves the
    majority of the existing drainage system. At that time, a detailed discussion will be
    necessary to determined acceptability of the decisions.


Breakout Project: The next topic covered was a potential breakout project from the overall
project:

    . Background: In early 2009, the Commissioner received a letter from the current Deputy
        Mayor and former Mayor of Raritan Township, John King, indicating that the current
        roadway configuration of northbound Route 31 at Minneakoning creates "a dangerous
         traffc pattern". The Township's Police Chief said "the abrupt termination of the merge
         lane at the Minneakoning intersection is dangerous and unacceptable. It's an invitation
         for disaster."




                                          Page 4
Minutes of Meeting
10/2/09


          In response to the letter, DPD investigated the situation and observed vehicles behaving
          in a pattern generally consistent with the Mayor's and Police Chief's observations and
          concerns. It appears that a combination of problems occurs. Some drivers use the
          second lane as a means to pass queued traffc in the thru lane and then "force" their
          way in near or at the intersection. Other drivers seem unaware of the need to merge
          until they are at or near the intersection creating sudden stops and merges. Potentially
          contributing to the issue, is that it is not uncommon for the northbound Route 31 queues
          at Minneakoning Road to extend beyond the merge signs, thus drivers who are
          unfamiliar with the roadway realize they need to merge at a point where traffic is queued
          in the other lane resulting in a more diffcult merge.

    . The project (Minneakoning to Prestige Plaza) was approved for Breakout by CPC in
          May 2009. The expectation was to advance this project as a Pipeline 3 solution, the
          primary concern was limited ROW width and the potential impacts possible due to
          existing conditions (existing fill section side slopes south of the Bartles Corner
          Intersection). Additionally, the initial goal was to advance this project at a rapid pace
          with an advertisement date set for the fall of 2010.

    . Urban explained that they analyzed two breakout alternatives. The first alternative
          proposes a second NB thru lane at Minneakoning that would extend thru Westcott Drive
          (the next signalized intersection). The second alternative extends the 2nd NB Thru lane
          through an additional intersection (Bartles Corner Road). The traffc results indicate that
          the alternative 1 would address the safety issue at Minneakoning, but would essentially
          shift the congestionlqueueing issue to Bartles Corner Road. That is, the long queues
          that current exist at Minneakoning would be shifted to Bartles Corner Road where
          there's currently only one northbound thru lane. The second alternative showed that, in
          addition to the safety issue being addressed, the queueing and delay issues would also
          be removed as all the NB delays at the signalized intersections are LOS 0 or better.

    . The basis for developing two alternatives was brought about by the constraints that
          became evident as we advanced the project. After coordinating with Geometrics, the
          initial intent was to include two through lanes and provide a shoulder that while requiring
          a design exception was consistent through the limits of the project. As the solution
          developed, additional concerns became evident. Minimizing the impact required the use
          of a 3% lane cross slope and a 6% shoulder cross slope. Additionally, an existing pipe
          crossing and outfall further complicated the progression of the design because of
          potential ROWand Permitting issues. Coordination with the CPM Project Manager
          occurred and the feedback provided was that the impacts do not graduate the project
          beyond the limits of a Pipeline 3; however the expected advertisement date of 2010
          would be improbable.

    . A detailed discussion ensued regarding the project. The consensus was that the project
          that extended the second NB lane through Bartles Corner Road was preferred. There
          was also discussion about the possibility of extending the second NB lane through the
          next signal (Prestige Plaza).

    . As far as a project timeline, the project should anticipate going to construction in 2011.
         This will allow for proper resolution of the design issues and provide time to address the
         need for ROW easements and potential permitting needs.

Action Items:

         Decision on Breakout Project - The consensus was that the project should anticipate
         going to construction in 2011. This will allow for proper resolution of the design issues
         and provide time to address the need for easements and potential permitting needs.

         Concurrence on Design Approach - This was approved with the qualification that
         changes will be coordinated and discussed as necessary with the relevant SMEs

         DPD and Urban to meet with Raritan Township to discuss the status of the breakout
         project.

         DPD and Urban to evaluate extending 2nd NB lane through Prestige Plaza

 RE: Design Year Traffc Volumes on NJ Route 31

 Purpose
The purpose of this memo is to present Urban's analysis of projected traffic conditions for
the Design Year (2035).

 Background
 In 2004 and 2005, detailed demand modeling was performed to estimate design year
2025 traffc volumes for the corridor. This modeling was based on the Hunterdon County
demographic forecast available at that time which projected traffic counts from 2000 and
2001 to the year 2025.

In 2007 new traffic data was collected including manual intersection counts along the NJ
Route 31 corridor in Flemington Borough and Raritan Township. The traffic volumes from
the 2007 and 2025 projections are provided in Table 1.

An average annual compounded growth rate of 1.5% was calculated based on the
difference in volume between the 2007 counts and the 2025 projections. After the original
traffic forecasts were completed, North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority (NJTPA)
released revised demographic forecasts which extend to 2030. A summary of the

As shown in Table 2, the average growth from 2005 to 2030 in Hunterdon County is
about 0.5% per year for population and households and about 1.5% per year for
employment. The anticipated population and household growth in Raritan Township is
less than 0.5% per year while the employment is slightly over 1 % per year. The
average growth of the population, household and employment for both the County and
Raritan Township is about 1 % per year which is significantly lower than the 1.5% per
year used to grow traffic volumes from 2007 to 2025. The lower growth rate is likely a
result of a number of factors including the Highlands legislation, changing development
patterns, smart growth initiatives, and the changes in the economy. It is also worth
noting that the growth rate is anticipated to significantly decrease between 2025 and
2030 in Raritan Township.

In order to examine the impact of these growth rates on the 2007 traffic volumes, a
growth rate of 1 % per year was used to project the 2007 volumes to 2030 and 2035.
These projections are provided in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, the traffic volumes previously developed for 2025 would be
considered very conservative based on the current demographic information. The 2025
projections are substantially higher than the anticipated volumes for 2030 using the 1 %
growth rate, and marginally less than those anticipated for 2035 using the same 1 %
growth rate.

In conclusion, based on the current demographic forecasts, a 1 % per year compounded
growth rate would be appropriate for developing projected 2035 traffic volumes based
on the 2007 traffic volumes. However, considering the relative closeness of the current
2025 projected traffic volumes to the projected 2035 traffic volumes using the 1 %
growth rate, and based on the fact that the current projected traffic volumes include site
specific development information, which would be more accurate than using a straight
growth rate, we recommend using the previously projected 2025 traffic volumes as the
design year 2035 traffic volumes.

         Raritan Township, Flemington Borough, Hunterdon County


PROJECT BACKGROUND

The NJ Route 31 Feasibility Assessment (FA) Study grew out of a problem statement
completed in early 2007 for the section of NJ Route 31 between Church Street and
Pennsylvania Avenue. The problem statement identified the issue as a lack of
consistency in the number of travel lanes which generates both congestion and safety
concerns. A Concept Development Study for this section of Route 31 was completed in
December 2008 with FA started in January 2009.
The Breakout Project was developed in response to a letter submitted by Raritan
Township to the Commissioner in early 2009. The letter was submitted by the current
Deputy Mayor and former Mayor of Raritan Township, John King, indicating that the
current roadway configuration of northbound Route 31 at Minneakoning creates "a
dangerous traffic pattern". The Township's Police Chief said "the abrupt termination of
the merge lane at the Minneakoning intersection is dangerous and unacceptable. It's an
invitation for disaster."
In response to the letter, DPD investigated the situation and observed vehicles
behaving in a pattern generally consistent with the Mayor's and Police Chief's
observations and concerns. It appears that a combination of problems occurs. Some
drivers use the second lane as a means to pass queued traffic in the thru lane and then
"force" their way in near or at the intersection. Other drivers seem unaware of the need
to merge until they are at or near the intersection creating sudden stops and merges.
Potentially contributing to the issue, is that it is not uncommon for the northbound Route
31 queues at Minneakoning Road to extend beyond the merge signs, thus drivers who
are unfamiliar with the roadway realize they need to merge at a point where traffic is
queued in the other lane resulting in a more difficult merge.
This current roadway configuration of Route 31 northbound at Minneakoning is a result
of roadway changes made as part of the Raritan Town Square Major Access agreement
with NJDOT.
As part of the agreement, the developers of the Raritan Town Square extended the
second northbound Route 31 thru lane, previously ending shortly after Walter Foran
                                            1

Drive, to Minneakoning Road. It had been DPD's and Major Access' intention that the
second thru lane extend beyond Minneakoning; however, in the final "fair share"
agreement the second lane terminated as a right-turn only lane at Minneakoning Road.
This memo provides general project information (project limits and purpose and need)
and information on the alternatives developed to date for the overall project as well as
for the breakout project.
More detailed information for both projects is included in the attached Project Fact
Sheets.


PROJECT LIMITS
The overall FA project study limits are from Church Street (MP 22.21) to the Raritan
River Crossing (MP 25.13). The project study limits for the breakout project are from
Minneakoning Road (MP 23.84) to the signalized intersection (MP 24.73) at the Stop-
and-Shop shopping center.



PROJECT PURPOSE AND NEED
As identified during the concept development phase of this project, the Project Purpose
is to develop alternatives that improve safety conditions and reduce congestion and
delay along the corridor. There were two Needs identified for the project:
   1. Improve Safety: There are a high number of crashes along the corridor
      particularly at the signalized intersections, lane drop locations and merge points.


   2. Reduce Current and Future Congestion and Delay: Currently, there are
      excessive delays and queuing at the intersections of NJ Route 31 with Walter
      Foran Boulevard, Minneakoning Road and Bartles Corner Road, as well as at the
      lane drop locations where travel lanes reduce from two per direction to one per
      direction. These conditions are projected to significantly deteriorate as approved,
      anticipated and future development occurs in and around the corridor. The
      upcoming opening of four new large developments exiting directly onto Route 31
      will exacerbate these delays and queuing.

DISCUSSION OF ALTERNATIVES

The Route 31 project area (M.P. 22 .21 to 25.13) was divided into four sections for the
purpose of development and evaluation of alternatives. The sections were delineated
based on their unique characteristics (i.e. number of lanes, shoulder widths, etc.) as
well as consideration of logical termini for break out projects. The sections and
alternatives are described below and can be found attached to this memo:
Section 1 (M.P. 22.21 to 23.14)
Section 1 begins just north of the Route 31 and Church Street intersection and extends
to just north of the Route 31 and East Main Street intersection. The existing cross
section throughout this section varies from two to five twelve foot lanes and shoulders
that vary between zero and ten feet. There is also a two-way left turn lane that has a
maximum width of sixteen feet throughout the section.

Section 2 (M.P. 23.14 to 23.84)
Section 2 begins at the intersection of Route 31 and East Main Street and extends to
the intersection of Route 31 and Minneakoning Drive. The roadway from East Main
Street to Walter Foran Boulevard will not be included in any alternatives because the
existing cross section has adequate number of lanes and width throughout (five lane
section, twelve foot travel lanes, ten foot shoulders, and a sixteen two-way left turn
lane). The roadway between Walter Foran Boulevard and Minneakoning Drive consists
of a three lane section with twelve foot travel lanes, eight to ten foot shoulders and a
sixteen foot two-way left turn lane throughout this area.

Section 3 (M.P. 23.84 to 24.73)
Section 3 begins just south of the intersection of Minneakoning Drive, tying into Section
2, and extends to the signalized intersection of Route 31 and the entrance to the Stop
and Shop shopping center (M.P. 24.73). The existing northbound cross section, in this
section of Route 31, consists of a single twelve foot travel lane and a shoulder that
varies between eight and ten feet. The southbound cross section consists of two twelve
foot travel lanes and a shoulder that varies between eight and ten feet. There is also a
sixteen foot two-way left turn lane throughout the section.

Section 4 (M.P. 24.73 to 25.13)
Section 4 begins with a tie-in to Section 3 and extends to southern end of the dualized
section of Route 31 just south of the bridge that crosses the Raritan River. This cross
section consists of one twelve foot lane in each direction with shoulders varying
between eight and ten feet.
Alternative 1 consists of a cross section of two twelve foot travel lanes, a ten foot
shoulder in both the north and southbound direction and a sixteen foot two-way left turn
lane. The cross section tapers down to two twelve foot lanes and ten foot shoulders in
each direction in the area where Route 31 crosses under the railroad bridge.

Alternative 2 has a cross section consisting of two twelve foot travel lanes and an eight
foot shoulder in both directions and a fourteen foot two-way left turn lane. The southern
end of Section 1 consists of two twelve foot travel lanes and an eight foot shoulder in
the southbound direction and one twelve foot travel lane and an eight foot shoulder in
the northbound direction. The cross section then tapers to one twelve foot lane and one

                                           4
                NJ Route 31 Feasibility Assessment - Project Fact Sheet


fifteen foot outside travel lane in the southbound direction and on fifteen foot lane in the
northbound direction. Once north of the railroad bridge, the cross section consists of
one twelve foot and one fifteen foot lane in the southbound direction and one fifteen foot
lane in the northbound direction. The cross section then widens to meet the existing
cross section between Highland Avenue and East Main Street. At the northern end of
the study area, the two travel lanes will taper down to one travel lane between Bartles
Corner Road and the end of Section 3.

Alternative 3 consists of one twelve foot inside travel lane and one fifteen foot outside
travel lane in both the northbound and southbound directions. There is also a two-way
left turn lane throughout the section which has a maximum width of sixteen feet. At the
northern end of the study area in Section 3, the cross section of this alternative consists
of two twelve foot travel lanes with a four foot shoulder. The travel lanes will taper down
to one travel lane between the intersection of Route 31 with Bartles Corner Road and
the end of Section 3. In Section 4, a twelve foot two-way left turn lane will also be
provided and the proposed cross section will transition to match the existing dualized
section of NJ Route 31.

Alternative 4 only applies to Section 1 and consists of two twelve foot travel lanes and
an eight foot shoulder in both the northbound and southbound directions with a sixteen
foot two-way left turn lane throughout. This cross section reduces to a twelve foot
inside lane and fifteen foot outside lane in the area of the railroad bridge. The cross
section north of the railroad bridge will open back up to the original proposed cross
section.
       Alternatives Traffic Analysis
       As the variations in alternatives are limited to shoulder and center turn lane
       widths, a traffic analysis was conducted for one alternatives assuming travel
       lanes to be 12 feet wide. The shoulder width, and center turn lane widths would
       have minimal or no impact on the traffic analysis. Table 1 provides the LOS and
       delay results by intersection for this alternative.

       Based on the traffic analysis, the 2035 traffic volumes would be expected to
       operate with acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better) with the exception of
       Walter Foran Boulevard, which would be a LOS E.

Alternatives Impact Analysis
       Access
       Due to widening in some areas access points along the Route 31 corridor
       will need to be adjusted or modified to follow the proposed edge of road.
       No revocations will be required.
       Utilities
       Several existing utilities have the potential for impacts due to the proposed
       alternatives. Upon determination of a preferred alternative, a detailed
       analysis and cost estimate will be completed.
       R.O.W.
       Due to the existing R.O.W. widths relative to the existing roadway width,
       the proposed R.O.W. takes are minimal. The estimated takes are as
       follows: Section 1 - Alternative 1 (9,200 S.F.), Alternative 2 (1,600 S.F.),
       Alternative 3 (3,000 S.F.), and Alternative 4 (6,400 S.F.). Sections 2 and
       Section 3 do not have any proposed R.O.W. impacts. Section 4 will also
       have R.O.W. impacts but have not been calculated at this time. The
       ROW impacts occur mostly between the Rail Bridge and New York Ave
       along the SB side.

Alternatives Cost Estimate
The following is a preliminary cost estimate for the overall project:

Preliminary Design (in-house)             $ 800,000.00
Preliminary Design (consultant)           $ 800,000.00

Final Design (consultant)                 $ 600,000.00
R.O.W.                                    $ 200,000.00
Construction Contract                     $3,000,000.00
Utilities (12-25%)                        $ 750,000.00
Construction Engineering                  $ 600,000.00
Construction Inspection                   $ 450,000.00
                                          $7,800,000.00

*Estimate assumes Alternative 1 will be used throughout and does not include
costs associated with the Breakout Project.
**The cost for replacing the Rail Bridge in Alternative 1 is approximately
$2,500,000.00.
Alternatives Stormwater Management
The overall project is situated within six sub-watersheds of the Raritan River
Basin including: (1) Raritan River at the roadway project northern limits, and
crosses several Raritan River tributaries sequentially traveling south as follows:
(2) unnamed tributary, (3) Assicong Creek, (4) Minneakoning Creek, (5) Bushkill
Creek, and (6) Bushkill Brook. The overall stormwater management approach is
to treat runoff water quality and quantity for each project segment addressing the
regulatory requirements.

BREAKOUT DISCUSSION
The overall purpose of the Route 31 FA project is to improve safety conditions and
reduce existing and projected congestion and delay along the corridor. The proposed
breakout project has the same project purpose with a focus at addressing the issues at
Minneakoning Road. The limits for the proposed breakout project are within the overall
project and extend from Minneakoning Road (MP 23.84) to the signalized intersection
(MP 24.73) at the Stop & Shop shopping center. This alternative would convert the
existing right only turn lane at Route 31 NB and Minneakoning Road to a thru-right lane.
This thru lane would then be extended beyond the intersection of Route 31 and Bartles
Corner Road where it will then taper back down to one travel lane before the signalized
intersection at the Stop & Shop shopping center. This alternative was designed to
address the deficiencies within the section while creating minimal impacts to the
surrounding areas. A design exception would be required for this alternative since the
shoulder along this section is proposed to be four feet wide.

A traffic analysis was conducted for the PM Peak hour which experiences the highest
delay on this section of roadway, to determine the benefits of the breakout project on
existing traffic conditions. The results of this analysis are provided in Table 3.

      Breakout Project Impacts
             Access
             Due to widening in some areas access points along this section will need
             to be adjusted or modified to follow the proposed edge of road. No
             revocation will be required.
             Utilities
             There are several utilities that will be impacted by the Breakout Project
             which include relocating several inlets along the existing edge of roadway,
             resetting manhole covers, relocating utility poles, and relocating signal
             equipment.
             R.O.W.
             There are no proposed R.O.W. takings for the Breakout Project.

      Break Out Project Cost Estimate
      The following is a preliminary cost estimate for the Breakout Project:

      Final Design (in-house)                  $ 250,000.00

                                               $1,700,000.00

      Break Out Project Stormwater Management
      For the Breakout project, the added impervious coverage is being addressed by
      utilizing certain basin facilities previously approved by the NJDEP (permit # 1000-
      03-001.1FHA, 030002FWW, 030001) and by adding detention capacity within the
      existing right of way where feasible for this ongoing effort.

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES

Preliminary CED forms for both the Breakout Project and the entire project are have
been prepared. All required field studies and a majority of the documentation for an
Ecology/Wetlands Technical Study have been completed. All other environmental study
tasks are being performed by NJDOT-BEPR.

The proposed breakout alternative is consistent with the overall project. The alternative
addresses the Town's concerns at Minneakoning Road. As indicated above, there are
no anticipated ROW impacts and the project has limited other impacts including utilities

Local Coordination

In late 2008, the FA project was discussed with Flemington Borough, Raritan Township
and Hunterdon County. Both the FA and the breakout project were then presented to
the Raritan Township Council in March 2009. Raritan Township supports both projects
and hopes to have the breakout project completed as soon as possible.

          NOTE     I - These show the maximum acceptable expanded width of a State highway segment. The widths of
                   lanes, shoulders, parking, sidewalk areas and rights-of-way shown are those derived from the standards for
                   desirable geometric design elements. The right-of-way width needed for the constrction of the highway
                   improvement may be less than the dimensions shown when less than desirable widths are used.

                   2 - This designation means that social, environmental, or economic constraints may limit the desirability
                   of State highway segment expansion. If compelling safety needs dictate, the Deparent wil construct or
                   require a permittee to construct highway improvements consistent with the design standards.

              ALL TURNING MOVEMENTS REFER TO BOTH INGRESS AND EGRESS.
              A TRAFFIC SIGNAL IS REQUIRED AT ALL JUGHANDLES.
              IF A JUGHANDLE IS AT A STREET. THEN PERMISSIBLE MOVEMENTS APPLY TO BOTH.
              IF TRAFFIC AT ACCESS POINT MEETS WARRANTS FOR A TRAFFIC SIGNAL. THEN THE SIGNALIZED SPACING STANDARDS MUST BE MET.
              THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO MINIMIZE MEDIAN OPENINGS ON DIVIDED HIGHWAYS BY ELIMINATING THOSE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH JUGHANDLES AND LEFT TURN LANES.

CONTROLLING SUBSTANDARD DESIGN ELEMENTS (CSDE)


Stopping Sight Distance on Vertical Curves
Based on the information obtained from the available record drawings, the
vertical curves along NJ Route 31 within the project limits were evaluated for
proper sight distance, all but two (See Table 1) met these criteria.

                Table 1: Vertical Curve Alignment, NJ Route 31


This will not be revised as part of the design as the project incorporates only
Northbound Route 31.


Shoulders
The ROM (Sec. 5-04.2) indicates the shoulder widths on land service highways
should not be less than 8 feet. The proposed design for this project will add an
additional travel lane in the northbound direction with a 4' outside shoulder. This
modification will require a design exception.

Access Impact Summary
Access Impact Summary

As part of the access review process, the existing conditions of
the driveways were examined for compliance with provisions of
the New Jersey State Highway Access Management Code, dated
August 2003. A copy of the applicable pages of the Access
Management Code, indicating the Access Level (AL) and
Desirable Typical Section (DTS), is included as Appendix E for
the portion of Route 31 located within the project limits.
The existing Route 31 corridor varies between a three lane to a
five lane undivided sections with a two-way left turn lane.
A review of the Access Code reveals that the DTS for this portion
of Route 31 is a 4A and that the AL is 3 (M.P. 22.02 - 24.40) and
2 (M.P. 24.40 - 30.26). A DTS of 4A specifies a section
containing 4 lanes, divided with shoulders or parking. An AL of 3
indicates right turn access with provision for left-turn access via
jug handle and an AL of 2 indicates access along street or
interchange only. The existing Route 31 does not satisfy this DTS
throughout the entire project limits.
The following indicates specific parcels which are in non-
conformance with provisions of the Access Code:


Edge clearance at lot lines
Section 16:47-3.B(c) of the Access Code requires a minimum
edge of clearance of 12 feet. This is measured from the extended
lot line along the curbline to the beginning of the curbline opening.
Several properties within the project limits have inadequate edge
clearance (12') at the parcel boundary, including:
    . Block B, Lots 10,20,21
    . Block   9, LotsB,9,11,14,14.01,16,23
    . Block 15, Lot 60
    . Block 16, Lots 19,22, 23


Access point curb line opening
Section 16:47-3.B(d) of the Access Code lists minimum and
maximum curbline opening for residential and non-residential
properties. The maximum allowable curbline opening for
residential and non-residential properties is 30 feet and 50 feet
respectively. There are no properties that are in non-
conformance for curbline opening.


Minimum Corner Clearance
Section 16:47 -3.8(k) of the Access Code lists the minimum corner
clearance for signalized and unsignalized intersection. The corner
clearance should be measured between the end of the curb return
of the intersecting street and the beginning of the curb return or
beginning of the depressed curb for the driveway. A minimum of
50 feet for all driveways in the vicinity of unsignalized
intersections is required as well as 100 feet for those driveways in
the vicinity of a signalized intersection. All access points within the
project limits fall within the above described criterion.

Introduction and Work Scope
This is a preliminary review of                   the stormwater infrastructure needs for the Route 31 Roadway
Improvement breakout project for Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza in light of                      the
NJDEP Stormwater Management rules. The work assessed the existing drainage system,
identified regional and sub-watershed settings, determine if Category One (WQ 1) waters are
present, quantified added impervious areas corresponding to discharge locations, assessed
feasible Best Management Practices (BMP) types, and presents BMP concepts and supporting
information.


Prospective drainage facilities were evaluated to assess feasible BMP types and locations, based
on Stormwater Management "Design and Performance Standards" (N.J.A.C. 7:8-5) criteria. A
preliminary hydrologic and hydraulic assessment was performed to approximate the land area
requirements for the recommended BMP type(s) targeted. The conceptual drainage scheme
shows BMP types and locations considered feasible. A preliminary checklist of                    "design
standards" based on the new rules was developed to aid in advancing a plan that can comply with
the rules.



Observed Existing Conditions
The project is situated within the Raritan River Watershed. There are sub-watersheds from north
to south identified on the location map as: (1) unnamed tributary, (2) unnamed tributary, (3)
Assicong Creek, and (4) Minneakoning Creek. The project site does not encroach into Category
1 water designated areas based on NJDEP GIS database. The South Branch of                      the Raritan River
is a State studied stream, but none of the associated stream tributary crossings are associated with
NJDEP State Studied streams. The Location Map attached shows the project area and stream
crossings.


Added Impervious Coverage
The added impervious coverage is 0.438 acres. Thus the project exceeds the stormwater rule's
0.25 acre threshold requiring compensatory controls.
 Screening of Appropriate BMP Types
 This study addresses the feasibility of BMP types that appear appropriate. Urban conducted a site
 investigation to assess site conditions and available land areas for BMPs within NJDOT right of
way. Soil types within the project limits are listed in Table I, Soils Map attached.

Conventional Detention/Infitration Basins
The feasibility of conventional detention/infiltration basins is typically limited by the available
land, or the acquisition of available land. A site inspection was conducted to identify prospective
basin locations. This breakout project has several relatively small improvements over
approximately        a one mile stretch of road, associated with four separate sub-drainage areas. The
added impervious coverage per sub-drainage area is individually less than 0.25 acres, but
collectively more than 0.25 acres over the collective four sub-drainage areas.




                                                            2
 There are limited areas to implement compensatory stormwater controls due to right of                                        way
 limitations, and there is economy of scale in managing stormwater at suitable and available sites
 where feasible. If necessary, compensatory water quality controls in one sub-watershed may
 compensate for deficiency in another sub-watershed under certain conditions. We have
 identified one location within the right of                       way and suffciently off set 50-feet from an adjacent
 stream, to comply with the Riparian Zone requirements, which can manage about 0.44 acres of
 impervious coverage off-setting the various improvements over this one mile road segment.
 The attached figure titled Detention BMP Concept shows the prospective BMP Basin location,
 adjacent to the Wescott Drive and Route 31 intersection, including contours associated with three
 basins in series that has the capacity to manage the contributing flow.


 Preliminary Hydrologic and Hydraulic Assessment of Recommended BMP's
A preliminary hydrologic and hydraulic assessment was conducted to assess the capacity of                                            the
 stormwater management facility to handle the flows. The BMP location is situated associated
with soils that are identified as having a Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG) of C, (soil testing is
pending), and may not have an significant obligation to promote infiltration. The following
identified the 2008 rainfall frequency data used for the assessment using the SCS/TR55
hydrologic method.

The runoff generated was modeled to enter a series of                                    basis with a gabion wall to limit
disturbance within the existing right of                       way, and a gabion spillway to detain and release water as
a conventional detention basin. Attached is the Hydraflow computer printout of                                       the preliminary
analysis showing that the basin has sufficient capacity to detain and manage the contributing
runoff    with the following resulting reduction in peak flows.

Checklist of New Stormwater Rules
Urban Engineers has developed a preliminary checklist itemizing some of                                    the Subchapter 5
criteria of     the new stormwater rules. Table 2 below summarizes the screening of                                these standards.

Specify Information Limitations!Reservations:
This preliminary Screening Checklist is provided at the conceptual design phase and is subject to change as
additional information is gathered and design is advanced. Acquisitions of additional ROW for water quality
detention basins are not anticipated.




Summary and Conclusions

There are sufficient opportunities for BMP stormwater controls that will require additional
ROW to manage storm water quality consistent with the stormwater management rules.

                             Addendum 1 (Revised)
Addendum 1 to the NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements, Minneakoning Road
through Prestige Plaza FAR proposes three (3) changes to the IPA.

The changes include the addition of a northbound right-turn lane at the following three
intersections:
   . Route 31 and Wescott Drive
   . Route 31 and Bartles Corner Road
   . Route 31 and Prestige Plaza

Provided below is (1) an explanation of the proposed changes to the IPA and the
reasons for the changes to the IPA, and (2) documentation on the impacts that would
occur as a result including additional impervious, costs, and ROW impacts.

The existing lane configuration in the northbound Route 31 direction at the three
intersections includes one (1) thru lane and one (1) right-turn lane. The current IPA has
proposed a lane configuration of an exclusive (1) thru lane and a shared thru-right turn
lane. The recommended changes to the IPA would result in two (2) thru lanes and one
(1) right-turn lane. Table1 below provides a schematic representation of the changes,
and attached to the addendum are plans providing more details on the proposed
changes.

The recommended changes were developed in response to input for NJDOT Subject
Matter Experts (SME) at a meeting on May 19th, 2010 (see attached Design
Communications Report). The SME meeting was in response to local concerns
regarding the lack of a northbound right-turn lane at Westcott Drive. At the time of the
meeting, it was decided that the a northbound right-turn lane should be included in the
breakout at Route 31 and Westcott Drive and at Route 31 and Prestige Plaza as means
to better separate turning traffic from through traffic thereby helping both operations and
safety. The northbound right-turn lane at Bartles Corner Road was not recommended
to be included in the breakout as a result of design issues (ROW impacts). Following
that meeting, additional property information became available that indicated that the

ROW would not be impacted and hence DPD has recommended that it be included in
the breakout project.

changes.

* Note: The original IPA increases the impervious coverage over the 0.25 acre threshold, so the
          additional impervious from the right turn lanes does not trigger additional requirements. The
          proposed SWM BMPs will address the additional impervious.

Cost Estimate
The preliminary construction cost estimate for the IPA is $1.8 Million. The additional
cost associated with the proposed improvements is estimated at $241,000. The revised
cost estimate for the IPA with the proposed improvements is $2.04 Million. It should be
noted that there are utility cost associated with the IPA which may increase based upon
the final construction layout. There is a sewer line relocation associated with the IPA
and at the time of this addendum a decision on who is responsible for the relocation has
yet to be determined. This item could potentially increase the costs above the estimate
of $2.04 Million.

Conclusion
It is recommended that the IPA for the NJ Route 31 Northbound Improvements,
Minneakoning Road through Prestige Plaza be modified to include northbound right turn
lanes at Route 31 and Wescott Drive, Route 31 and Bartles Corner Road and Route 31
and Prestige Plaza as shown on the attached plans.

No. 7550                                                                       Traffic Engineering & Access
Meeting Date: May 19, 2010
Attending: John Molé (NJDOT - DPD), Chrs Barretts (NJDOT - TSSE), Richard Dube
(NJDOT - Access), J ayesh K. Patel (NJDOT - Access), Mazhar Paroya (NJDOT -
Access), Samir Shah (NJDOT - CPM), Bill McGarrgel (Urban), Ryan Cavender (Urban),
Scott Diehl (Urban)
Meeting Purpose: To discuss access and traffc issues with the proposed Route 31 design
Key Issues, Decisions, and Action Items
1. After reviewing the design issues and traffc volumes, a decision was made to provide a
NB right-tum lane into BJ's at Wescott Dr.

2. Two additional locations along Route 31 that have existing right-tum lanes that are
proposed to be converted to shared thr-right lanes were evaluated: Route 31 and Bartles
Comer Road, and Route 31 and Prestige Plaza.

      . After reviewing the design issues and traffc volumes at Route 31 and Bartles
            Comer Road, it was decided that a northbound right-tum lane will not be included
            as part of      the Route 31 Breakout Project. The general discussion was that the right
            tum lane should be provided but that due to required right of     way acquisition and
            physical constraints such as grading etc. we would not provide one at this location
            at this time.

      . After reviewing the design issues and traffc volumes at Route 31 and Prestige
            Plaza, it was decided that a northbound right-tum lane should be included as part of
            the Route 31 Breakout Project at this intersection. The right-tum lane should start
            north of  the right-inlright-out access that is part of a new development being
            constructed a little south of               the intersection.

 3. At both Route 31 and Wescott Dr and Route 31 and Prestige Plaza, the southbound
     left-tum signal would need to be changed to protected only ifnot already protected
       only since the left-turning traffic would be turning across three lanes of                  traffc.

4. As a result of    the proposed changes additional studies will need to be completed to
       determine additional impacts to right of way, utilities, environmental, design costs,
       construction costs, and both design and construction schedule etc.

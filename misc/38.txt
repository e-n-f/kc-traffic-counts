                                                                                                                1

                                                                                          Brownswood Road
                                                                                         September 19, 2013



I.         Statement of Purpose, Intent, Objectives
The tract within Brownswood Road, totaling 30.18 acres, is identified as TMS number 279-00-00-226 as
found on the tax maps included as Appendix B of this report. The property is surrounded by a mix of
County and City properties with varying zoning designations. To the North and West are City of Charleston
properties zoned RR-1 and SR-1 and Charleston County property zoned RR-3. To the East are City of
Charleston Properties zoned SR-1. To the South are properties in Charleston County zoned R-4 and R-1 and
City of Charleston zoned SR-1.
The Brownswood Road Tract is currently zoned R-4 in Charleston County. The Charleston County R-4
zoning limits this tract to a maximum yield of 4 units / upland acre (29.34 upland acres) or 117 total units.
This PUD and annexation will provide flexibility in lot size and creating useable open space.
This planned development is intended to meet the criteria listed in Section 54-254 in the South Carolina
zoning code. The PUD allows flexibility in the neighborhood design to work around the site's grand trees,
provide a neighborhood park, achieve multiple connections to surrounding properties, and provide an
opportunity for neighborhood and commercial businesses to serve the surrounding residents. This document
is consistent with the City's adopted comprehensive plan and all adopted plans for sub-areas of the City.
Further, by creating additional open space this development better achieves the goals of adopted plans or
under other zoning district regulations. This development is also consistent with the City's adopted master
road plan. By designing the development around existing ground trees and generating 20% open space that
includes a large park around a grand Live Oak tree, this development protects and preserves natural and
cultural resources better than zoning district regulations.
Further, this planned development has been designed for compatibility with density and building height
restrictions of adjacent developed neighborhoods and the zoning of adjacent undeveloped areas. It is also
compatible with the existing network of public streets in adjacent neighborhoods and areas through multiple
connections. Additionally, this development provides adequate parking for residents and users, as prescribed
by the zoning code. Also, this development is accommodated by existing and planned public facilities
including roads, sewer, water, schools, parks, open space and recreational amenities. Correspondence
letters on record, coordinating with utility services are included within this document. Finally, the HOA will
adequately provide for the continued maintenance of common areas, open space, and other public facilities
not dedicated to the city.
Upon City approval, these Planned Development Guidelines shall apply to the entire 30.18 acres of this
tract. Any zoning details not outlined in these guidelines will adhere to the current City of Charleston zoning
guidelines and will default to SR-1 land use regulations. A Conceptual Master Plan has been included within
the appendices of this report.




II.        Land Uses, Setback Criteria

VI.     Signs
Two master entrance subdivision signs may be constructed where the property makes vehicular connections
to Brownswood Road. The master entrance subdivision signs will be designed according to City of
Charleston standards and may occur within the buffer.
Secondary entrance signs may be constructed at connection point to adjacent properties. All signs and
associated landscaping will be maintained by the POA. All signage will be submitted for site plan and
encroachment permit review. All other items will be in accordance with the City of Charleston standards.
In addition, there will be directional and traffic signage located throughout the subdivision.


VII.    Buffers
Wetland buffers shall be per Army Corps of Engineers requirements . These buffer requirements are
designated by the Army Corps of Engineers and supersede any City of Charleston requirements. Paved or
non-paved walking trails, 6' wide or less will be allowed within the wetland buffers subject to Army Corps of
Engineers' approval.
A required, Type E, 50' buffer will be provided along Brownswood Road and will be maintained by the

VIII.   Amenity Areas and Open Space
A large green with a playfield, seating, walking trail, and mail kiosk will be provided as amenities. These
entities will be located within open space areas and shall be owned and maintained by the POA.


Open space is calculated as 20% of the gross acreage. The proposed Concept Plan meets or exceeds the
required open space.

Usable open space is calculated as 25% of the required open space. The proposed Concept Plan meets or
exceeds the required usable open space.

Useable open space improvements must be shown on Construction Documents and installed prior to final
plat.

The size and location of open space and useable open space shown within the plans included in this
document are subject to adjustment; however, these spaces will remain in excess of the required minimums.

All open space falling within Right of Ways will be maintained by the POA. All other open space will be
owned and maintained by the POA.

Open space definitions are as follows:
       Open Space. Any parcel or area of land or water essentially unimproved and set aside, dedicated,
       designated or reserved for public or private use or enjoyment, or for the use and enjoyment of
       owners and occupants of land adjoining or neighboring such open space. Open space shall not
       include streets, drives, off-street parking and loading areas, area so located or of such size or shape
       to have no substantial aesthetic or recreational value and any area within residential lots.
        Useable Open Space. Open space areas of high ground developed to provide for active recreational
        uses. Examples of possible types of usable open spaces could include paths, play fields, benches,

See Appendix for Conceptual Open Space Plan.


IX.    Tree Summary

The site is currently mostly open with a mix of hardwoods. There are numerous grand trees, creating a
unique opportunity to incorporate the grand trees into the character of the development, and at the same
time creating a challenge in design. All grand trees will be protected using tree protection standards pursuant
to the City of Charleston Zoning Ordinance. Any removal of Grand Trees will require approval by variance
through the City of Charleston Board of Zoning Appeals. Encroachments into Grand Tree Protective zones
will also be subject to approval of the City of Charleston BZA.



X.     Additional Development Criteria
Sales and/or construction trailers and associated parking areas are allowed on POA areas or designated lots
prior to the recording of plats. Site plan review and issuance of clearing and grading permits are required
prior to the issuance of the required permit.
In all cases where sidewalks, tree plantings, or mitigation plantings are required prior to the approval of a
final plat for the property, sidewalks and tree mitigation shall either be installed, inspected and deemed
acceptable by the City, or the Owner shall provide a performance bond, letter of credit, or other security
acceptable to the City in the amount of 150% of construction as a guarantee that the work will be
performed. Sidewalks and tree plantings shall be contingent upon approval of encroachment permit and
construction plans by the City. These items will be submitted for review by Public Services, Engineering and
Parks and Recreation Departments.
Canopy Street trees will be allowed in the right of way between the sidewalk and curb, whether roll curb or
straight curb. Street trees will not count towards tree mitigation for tree variances. A Street Tree Plan will be
required to be submitted for review and approval by the City Parks Department.


Water will be served by Saint John's Water Company
Sewer will be served by Charleston Water Systems for this project.


XI.    Subdivision
This P.U.D is currently a composed of a single parcel with singular ownership. Commercial and single
family lots will be subdivided through subsequent plat submittals. The commercial parcel may be
subdivided into multiple lots, provided that the subdivision meets the development criteria set forth in the
standards of this PUD. This project is to be built in phases. A phasing plan has been included in the
appendices of this document.


XII.    Cultural Resources
Upon site visit, as well as background research conducted using the South Carolina Department of Archives
and History, there appear to be no existing cultural or historic resources located on this site. A cultural
resource exhibit has been included in the appendices of this document.

Executive Summary
A traffic impact analysis was conducted for the proposed Brownswood Road residential
development in accordance with SCDOT and City of Charleston guidelines. The development is
located on the east side of Brownswood Road north of Main Road in the City of Charleston,
South Carolina. The development is proposed to consist of up to 109 single-family dwelling units
and a community-related center. Access to the development will be provided by two full-access
driveways along Brownswood Road and one cross-access connection to The Retreat at Johns
Island, an adjacent development to the south of the project site.

A review of the driveway spacing along Brownswood Road was undertaken for the two project
driveways. The spacing of the North Project Driveway/Comsee Lane intersection to Dogpatch
Lane does not meet the driveway spacing requirements; however, due to the fact that Dogpatch
Lane is a low-volume dirt road and the fact that it is desirable to align the project driveway with
the existing Comsee Lane to the west, no modifications to the location of the North Project
Driveway are recommended.

The results of the intersection analyses indicate that the study intersections currently operate
and are expected to continue to operate at an acceptable LOS with consideration of the
Brownswood Road development.

Based upon the results of the turn-lane warrant analysis, exclusive left-turn and right-turn lanes
are not recommended at either project driveway at this time.

1.0     Introduction
The purpose of this report is to document a traffic impact analysis for the proposed Brownswood
Road residential development in accordance with SCDOT and City of Charleston guidelines.
This report summarizes the procedures and findings of the traffic impact analysis.

1.1     Project Background

The Brownswood Road residential development is located on the east side of Brownswood
Road north of Main Road in the city of Charleston, South Carolina. The development is
proposed to consist of up to 109 single-family dwelling units and a community-related center.
Access to the development will be provided by two full-access driveways along Brownswood
Road and one cross-access connection to The Retreat at Johns Island, an adjacent
development to the south of the project site.

Based upon discussions with SCDOT and City of Charleston staff, the traffic impact analysis
considers the weekday AM peak hour and the weekday PM peak hour as the study time frames,
and the two existing intersections of Main Road & Brownswood Road and Brownswood Road &
Southwick Drive comprise the study area.

The buildout date of the development is anticipated to be 2016; therefore, future-year 2016
conditions were analyzed as the Build scenario. Exhibit 1.1 illustrates the location of the project
site, including the adjacent public roadway network. Exhibit 1.2 illustrates a conceptual layout of
the project site.

1.2     Existing Roadway Conditions

Brownswood Road is a two-lane, undivided collector primarily serving residential uses. The
speed limit is 30 miles per hour (mph) south of Maple Grove Drive and 45 mph north of Maple
Grove Drive. The 2012 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) for Brownswood Road was 1,800
vehicles per day (vpd). Based upon the existing turning movement counts, the percentage of
heavy vehicles along Brownswood Road is approximately 5%.

Main Road is a two-lane, undivided minor arterial serving residential and commercial uses. The
speed limit is 45 mph and the 2012 AADT was 10,900 vpd. Based upon the existing turning
movement counts, the percentage of heavy vehicles along Main Road is approximately 6%.

Southwick Drive is a two-lane, undivided local roadway serving mostly residential uses. Based
upon the existing turning movement counts, the percentage of heavy vehicles along Southwick
Road is approximately 7%.

2.0     Driveway Spacing
Access to the Brownswood Road residential development will be provided by two full-access
driveways, referred to as the North Project Driveway that will align with Comsee Lane on the
west and the South Driveway, along Brownswood Road and one cross-access connection to
The Retreat at Johns Island, an adjacent development to the south of the project site. A review
of the driveway spacing along Brownswood Road was undertaken based upon information
contained in SCDOT's Access & Roadside Management Standards (ARMS) manual.

In the area of the development, Brownswood Road has a speed limit of 45 mph. Based upon
the speed limit and spacing criteria of ARMS, a minimum driveway spacing of 325 feet from
near edge to near edge is required.

The North Project driveway aligns with the existing Comsee Lane to the west and is located
approximately 960 feet from the South Project driveway to the south. The North Project
Driveway/Comsee Lane intersection is located approximately 175 feet from Dogpatch Lane to
the north, which is a dirt road that provides access to approximately 10 residences. The spacing
to Dogpatch Lane does not meet the spacing requirements; however, due to the fact that
Dogpatch Lane is a low-volume dirt road and the fact that it is desirable to align the project
driveway with the existing Comsee Lane to the west, no modifications to the location of the
North Project Driveway are recommended.

The South Project driveway is located approximately 960 feet from the North Project driveway to
the north and 365 feet from Maple Grove Drive to the south, which meets the minimum driveway
spacing requirements.

Project traffic used in this analysis is defined as the vehicle trips expected to be generated by
the proposed development. These trips were distributed and assigned throughout the study
roadway network.

3.1     Proposed Land Uses

The Brownswood Road residential development is proposed to consist of up to 109 single-
family dwelling units and a community-related center. The specific uses for the community-
related center is unknown at this time; therefore, a 5,000 square-foot Day Care Center and
10,000 square-foot Church were assumed for the purposes of this analysis. Currently, the
project site is primarily undeveloped.

3.2     Trip Generation Estimates

The trip generation potential for the development was estimated using information contained in
ITE's Trip Generation, 9th Edition (2012) reference. The estimates utilized land use codes (LUC)
210 ­ Single-Family Detached Housing, 560 ­ Church, and 565 ­ Day Care Center, and were
developed for the weekday daily, weekday AM peak hour of the adjacent street, and weekday
PM peak hour of the adjacent street time periods.

Due to the likelihood that the day care center and church would attract trips from within the
residential development, internal capture estimates were also considered based upon
information in NCHRP's Report 684 ­ Enhancing Internal Trip Capture Estimation for Mixed-Use
Developments.

The trip generation estimates for the development are shown in Table 3.1 and documented in
Appendix A.

3.3      Trip Distribution & Assignment

New, external traffic expected to be generated by the Brownswood Road residential
development was distributed and assigned to the roadway network based upon existing and
projected travel patterns in the area. The general distribution of new project trips was assumed
to be:

         35% to/from the east via Southwick Drive (to Maybank Highway);

         25% to/from the east via Main Road;
              Consisting of 20% to/from Maybank Highway and 5% to/from Bohicket Road;

         20% to/from the north via Brownswood Road;
              Consisting of 10% to/from Maybank Highway via River Road and 10% to/from
                 Main Road via River Road;

         15% to/from the west via Main Road; and

         5% to/from the south via Brownswood Road (to Maybank Highway).

The assignment of project traffic, in terms of number of new trips, is illustrated in Exhibit 3.1.

                                      Brownswood Road Residential Development ­ Traffic Impact Analysis



4.0     Traffic Volume Development
Existing 2013 traffic volumes were collected for use in the analysis and future-year traffic
volumes were developed for projected 2016 conditions. The future-year traffic volumes
consisted of existing traffic volumes adjusted by an annual growth rate, vested traffic volumes
from approved developments in the area, and projected traffic volumes for the Brownswood
Road residential development.

4.1     Existing Traffic Volumes

Vehicle turning movement counts were conducted at the intersections of Main Road &
Brownswood Road and Brownswood Road & Southwick Drive during the weekday AM peak
period (from 7:00 to 9:00 AM) and the weekday PM peak period (from 4:00 to 6:00 PM) for use
in the traffic impact analysis. The counts were conducted in August 2013 while the local school
district was in session.

The existing 2013 AM and PM peak-hour traffic volumes are illustrated in Exhibit 4.1 and
documented in Appendix C.

4.2     Future Traffic Volume Projections

Historical count data along Brownswood Road and Main Road (SCDOT count stations #347 and
#508) was reviewed over the past five years. The results of this review indicate that the
roadways have experienced negative growth during this time period. However, to provide for a
conservative analysis, an annual growth rate of 3.0% was utilized to develop 2016 No Build
traffic volumes. In addition, vested traffic from the approved Fenwick Hills residential
development was also considered in the development of 2016 No Build traffic volumes. The
2016 No Build traffic volumes are illustrated in Exhibit 4.2 and documented in Appendix C.

The Brownswood Road residential development project traffic volumes were then added to the
2016 No Build traffic volumes to develop 2016 Build traffic volumes, which are illustrated in
Exhibit 4.3 and documented in Appendix C.

5.0     Traffic Impact Analysis
Using the existing and projected traffic volumes previously discussed, intersection analyses
were conducted for the study intersections considering 2013 Existing conditions, 2016 No Build
conditions and 2016 Build conditions. This analysis was conducted using the Transportation
Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodologies of the Synchro, Version 8
software.

Intersection level of service (LOS) grades range from LOS A to LOS F, which are directly
related to the level of control delay at the intersection and characterize the operational
conditions of the intersection traffic flow. LOS A operations typically represent ideal, free-flow
conditions where vehicles experience little to no delays, and LOS F operations typically
represent poor, forced-flow (bumper-to-bumper) conditions with high vehicular delays, and are
generally considered undesirable. Table 5.1 summarizes the HCM control delay thresholds
associated with each LOS grade for unsignalized and signalized intersections.

5.1     Intersection LOS Analysis

As part of the intersection analysis, SCDOT's default Synchro parameters were utilized,
including a peak-hour factor of 0.90. Existing heavy vehicle percentages, as previously
discussed, were utilized in the analysis with a minimum percentage of 2% considered
throughout the study network. Existing lane geometry was utilized throughout the study network
for all study scenarios.

Using the Synchro software, intersection analyses were conducted for 2013 Existing conditions,
2016 No Build conditions and 2016 Build conditions, for both the weekday AM peak-hour and
the weekday PM peak-hour time periods. The results of the intersection analyses for existing
and future-year conditions for the weekday AM and PM peak-hour time periods are summarized
in Table 5.2. For unsignalized intersections, the LOS and delay results are shown for the worst-
case minor-street approaches only, as based upon the HCM methodologies for unsignalized
intersections.

5.2     Turn Lane Analysis

An analysis was conducted to determine the need for exclusive left-turn and right-turn lanes for
the proposed ingress turning movements at the two project driveway intersections along
Brownswood Road. This analysis was conducted utilizing the criteria documented in SCDOT's
ARMS manual and Highway Design Manual (2003).

At the North Project Driveway intersection, the projected AM and PM peak-hour northbound
right-turn traffic volumes, 9 and 15 vehicles respectively, of the 2016 Build conditions scenario
do not meet the exclusive right-turn lane warrant criteria. The projected AM and PM peak-hour
southbound left-turn traffic volumes, 20 and 36 vehicles respectively, of the 2016 Build
conditions scenario do not meet the exclusive left-turn lane warrant criteria. Therefore, exclusive
turn lanes are not recommended at this time for the North Project Driveway.

At the South Project Driveway intersection, the projected AM and PM peak-hour northbound
right-turn traffic volumes, 11 and 21 vehicles respectively, of the 2016 Build conditions scenario
do not meet the exclusive right-turn lane warrant criteria. The projected AM and PM peak-hour
southbound left-turn traffic volumes, 11 and 20 vehicles respectively, of the 2016 Build
conditions scenario do not meet the exclusive left-turn lane warrant criteria. Therefore, exclusive
turn lanes are not recommended at this time for the South Project Driveway.

Worksheets documenting the analysis are provided in Appendix G.

6.0     Summary of Findings and Recommendations
A traffic impact analysis was conducted for the proposed Brownswood Road residential
development in accordance with SCDOT and City of Charleston guidelines. The development is
located on the east side of Brownswood Road north of Main Road in the City of Charleston,
South Carolina. The development is proposed to consist of up to 109 single-family dwelling units
and a community-related center. Access to the development will be provided by two full-access
driveways along Brownswood Road and one cross-access connection to The Retreat at Johns
Island, an adjacent development to the south of the project site.

A review of the driveway spacing along Brownswood Road was undertaken for the two project
driveways. The spacing of the North Project Driveway/Comsee Lane intersection to Dogpatch
Lane does not meet the driveway spacing requirements; however, due to the fact that Dogpatch
Lane is a low-volume dirt road and the fact that it is desirable to align the project driveway with
the existing Comsee Lane to the west, no modifications to the location of the North Project
Driveway are recommended.

The results of the intersection analyses indicate that the study intersections currently operate
and are expected to continue to operate at an acceptable LOS with consideration of the
Brownswood Road development.

Based on the results of the turn-lane warrant analysis, exclusive left-turn and right-turn lanes
are not recommended at either project driveway at this time.

Re: Gas Availability TMS # 279-00-00-226

Dear Anna:

I am pleased to inform you that South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G) will
be able to provide natural gas service to the above referenced project. Services will be
provided in accordance with SCE&G's General Terms and Conditions, other documents
on file with the South Carolina Public Service Commission, and the company's standard
operating policies and procedures.

Any cost associated with providing service will be determined when a finalized/approved
plan is submitted to our office. In order to begin engineering work for the project, the
following information will need to be provided:

      1.) Detailed utility site plan (AutoCAD format preferred) showing water, sewer,
          and storm drainage. The finalized/approved plan must include lot
          numbers, street names, and 911 addresses for each lot.
      2.) Additional drawings that indicate wetlands boundaries, tree survey with
          barricade plan and buffer zones (if required), as well as any existing or
          additional easements will also be needed.
      3.) Copies of the Army Corp of Engineers official delineation and permits. If
          applicable, OCMR permits should also be included.
      4.) Signed copy of this letter acknowledging its receipt and responsibility for
          its contents and authorization to begin engineering work with the
          understanding that SCE&G intends to serve the referenced project.

SCE&G's construction standards and specifications are available upon request. For
more information or questions, contact me by phone at (843) 576-8909 or at
slamonica@scana.com


Sincerely,



Steve LaMonica

Re: Sewer Availability to TMS #279-00-00-226 to serve 109 single family residential units

Dear Ms. Lewis,

This letter is to certify our willingness and ability to provide wastewater collection service to the above
referenced site in Charleston County, South Carolina. Wastewater collection service to this site may be made
available via the existing eight inch gravity main in the right of way of Field Planters Rd. Any subdividing of
the property subsequent to this correspondence will require a review process of the civil engineering plans to
ensure compliance with the Charleston Water System minimum standards. Any extensions and/or
modifications to the infrastructure to serve this site will be a developer expense. Please be advised that
wastewater impact fees, wastewater tap fees, change-in-use fees, and/or cost to extend fees will be due prior
to connection of any Charleston Water System's sewer system. This letter does not reserve capacity in the
Charleston Water System infrastructure and it is incumbent upon the developer or his agent to confirm the
availability herein granted past 12 months of this correspondence.

The Charleston Water System certifies the availability of service only insofar as its rights allow. Should
access to our existing sewer main/mains be denied by appropriate governing authorities, the Charleston Water
System will have no other option than to deny service.

Please contact St. John's Water Company with water service issues.

This letter is not to be construed as a letter of acceptance for operation and maintenance from the Department
of Health and Environmental Control.

If there are any questions pertaining to this letter, please do not hesitate to call on me at (843) 727-6870.

Sincerely,



Cheryl L. Boyle
Engineering Assistant
Charleston Water System

RE: TMS: 279-00-00-226

To Whom It May Concern:

This letter is to confirm that Comcast Cable is the franchised video service provider for
the new location of Charleston, SC. Upon execution of a property-specific agreement, the
terms of which will be negotiated separately, Comcast can and will extend its cable plant
to the property so that the residents there will have access to Xfinity Video, High-Speed
Data, and Digital Voice services.

Depending on cost to extend the plant, the owner may be asked to bear some of the cost
of cable plant construction.

Should you have any additional questions, please contact me at 843-266-3094.

Preliminary Archeological Research



To Whom it may Concern,

SeamonWhiteside has conducted preliminary research to determine the likelihood of archeological

resources on the Brownswood Road PUD site, TMS 279-00-00-226. There are no archeological

resources on-site or in close proximity to the site that are shown in the State Historic Preservation Office

(SHPO) database. An exhibit from the SHPO website has been included following this letter. Upon

visiting the site, there appear to be no historic structures or visible historic ruins on the site.




Sincerely,



David R Seamon

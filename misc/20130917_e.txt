                      BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS

                                Work Session

                            September 3, 2013

                                   3:00 p.m.

                                Cherokee Hall

                                   MINUTES

The Chairman began at 3:02 p.m. with all Commissioners present. Due to the full
Work Session Agenda as well as the 4:30 Joint Meeting of the RRDA/BOC, he went
straight into the meeting.



     1.    FY2014 Budget Overview by Janelle Funk.

  Janelle Funk went over the FY2014 budget, attached as part of these minutes.
  She said that there would be a public hearing on September 17 on the FY2014
  budget as well. The Board will consider adopting the FY2014 Budget on October
  1st.

  Commissioner Johnston asked if we always had a certain amount of vacant
  positions just waiting to be replaced. Janelle replied yes and most are part-
  time.

  Commissioner Johnston asked if the Day Trucks were already in effect. Chief
  Dan West replied that they were in effect and in the test phase.

  Chairman Ahrens asked why the admin costs in Workers Comp had doubled.
  Ms. Funk replied that it was due to timing to true up to the new fiscal year, so it
  was not really an increase.

     2.    Proposed Precinct Changes for 2014 by Janet Munda.
Janet Munda thanked the Board for allowing her to present the proposed
precinct changes. She said that she had met with the Elections Board and her
office has also teamed up with GIS Director, Joe Woycke, who was extremely
helpful in implementing new precinct lines that will be best for the County. Ms.
Munda advised that the proposed precinct changes did not affect who you vote
for, it only affects the location of where a person votes.

Ms. Munda went over statistics that led to where we are now and a timeline on
when changes will be implemented. She said that the Elections Board is hoping
to adopt the changes by the end of the year.

Chairman Ahrens commented that the big challenge will be to get citizens
informed of the precinct changes.

The Chairman asked for a ballpark figure of how much of a cost savings could
be involved. Ms. Munda replied that in some elections it could be about a 25%
savings, but maybe not as much in others like presidential elections.

The Chairman advised that the Board would do whatever they could to help get
the word out. Ms. Munda thanked the Board for their support.

Chairman Ahrens asked about the May 20 primary election. Ms. Munda replied
that the Federal Date will be May 20 and State and Local will be in March.

Commissioner Johnston asked if it would automatically be updated as
properties are annexed. Ms. Munda replied that it would.

  3.    Discussion of Etowah Community Standards.

The Chairman stated that a Public Hearing is set to discuss the Etowah
Community standards on September 17. He added that he had indicated that at
least seven days prior to the Public Hearing Jeff Watkins and his staff would
have documents to present to the public posted online, which should be by
Friday of this week. He then recalled past meetings where various plans and
metrics were discussed. He said that tonight he would like to get to a meeting
of the minds on the plans so that they might have something prepared to adopt
at the Public Hearing.

Jeff Watkins gave the Board and Parks Huff a handout of zoning conditions and
presented an overview of the events on the project that goes back to the
1990's. Included in the handout is a new category of residential ­ Easy Living
Homes.
Chairman Ahrens asked about certification under the program. Margaret
Stallings said that it was indicated on the top of the Easy Living Standards
section that all homes will be certified.

Patrick Clark asked to speak and said that he and Parks Huff were here to get
some governance and clarity to the site plans that were approved in 2006. He
added that they were open to discussion to clarify or define but not reduce the
type of lots discussed in 2006. Mr. Clark and Mr. Huff presented a large drawing
of the site plan that they said was replicated from the plan presented in 2006.

Commissioner Poole asked what the actual numbers were on that plan.
Chairman Ahrens said that there were no numbers. Commissioner Johnston
interjected that you have to count all the colored squares. Parks Huff stated
that the site plan as replicated tonight was approved according to the minutes
in 2006. Chairman Ahrens said that the topic was actually discussed more in
depth during the Work Session of that particular meeting and that it could be
found on the video at the 1:08 mark. He read from the Work Session Minutes
that certain pieces moved around but that the 1,800 units had the same
quantities of each category.

Mr. Huff stated there were 710 units and that they were concerned with quality
so they split the 710 so that half of the units were Easy Living Standards.
Commissioner Johnston said that that was not the Board's interpretation, nor
was it the interpretation of the other four Board members. He added that it is
clear now that there had never been a meeting of the minds on this project.

Commissioner Nelms asked what the middle ground was. Mr. Clark replied the
movement has been to further define what that is and to show the flexibility of
the market. Commissioner Poole asked for the target number of 18,000 sq. ft.
estate lots and what number they would like to see. Mr. Clark replied 348.
Commissioner Poole asked if they were asking for the 12,000 estate lots at 742
and Easy Living homes at 710. Commissioner Nelms said that he had heard
different numbers ranging from 345 to 350. Mr. Huff stated that what is drawn
on their plan is 348 and 742.

Mr. Huff said they had talked about placing a cap on cluster homes.
Commissioner Nelms asked what the current number of the cluster homes is
now. Mr. Huff replied 710. Commissioner Johnston stated that it is all under
high density categories and that it is still under conditions of zoning and the
current cap is 350. Commissioner Nelms referenced the meeting that took place
recently and asked why they were uncomfortable with the reduction of half in
the Easy Living. Mr. Huff clarified they are comfortable with it.
  Mr. Clark spoke about the exterior lots, stating that they had addressed those
  concerns.

  Chairman Ahrens asked Mr. Watkins if he had any suggestions on what degree
  of specificity of options to provide in the documents. He also asked if he would
  prefer to offer alternatives or one set of plans. Mr. Watkins replied that one set
  inclusive enough to cover everything would be preferable.

  Commissioner Johnston asked the question of why they were even having this
  discussion on zoning. He asked who the applicant was. He added that the
  applicant could ask for whatever they wanted and it would be up to the Board
  to approve it or not. Commissioner Nelms stated that this is where he was at
  also. He said that he hoped to find some middle ground and that he didn't feel
  they were too far from that.

  Chairman Ahrens stated that the Public Hearing would be held at 6:00 on the
  regular agenda and that documents would be available by the end of the week.
  Mr. Watkins stated for clarity that the Etowah Community owners were the
  applicants, not the County.

     4.    Discussion of Regular Agenda Items.

The Chairman said that he had looked over the agenda and did not see anything in
particular that needed to be discussed and asked if anyone else had questions
about the agenda.

Hearing none, Commissioner Nelms moved to adjourn the Work Session at 4:48
p.m. to go into the Special Joint BOC/RRDA Meeting; Commissioner Gunnin
seconded and the motion carried unanimously.




             Executive Session followed the Special Joint Meeting.

Chief Prather spoke about two firefighters who recently went above and
beyond the call of duty. He said that both were off-duty and in different
states, but on the same day, August 2, 2013, they both performed life-
saving actions. He said that with Firefighters Appreciation Week and the
Patriots Day Remembrance, the timing was right to present the awards to
these two exemplary employees.       Chief Eddie Robinson presented the
Meritorious Action Awards to Lt. Mike Malone, who has 18 years of service
with the County and to Lt. John Bennett, who has 13 years of service with

Chairman Ahrens said that this discussion is a follow on and follow up of
previous discussions that began in 1990 related to the development of the
1,300 acre site with 2 miles on the Etowah River. He stated that a Public
Hearing had been called a couple of times and not held. He said there is a
Public Hearing scheduled for September 17 at 6:00 p.m. to consider
development of community standards. Included in that are descriptions of
the residential unit mix of some 1,800 residences, which is down from 2,800

the Public Hearing. He said that this was just an update-we expect to have
the Public Hearing and expect to have details available on the web by end of

                                Cherokee County
             Description of Modification of Zoning Conditions Request
                 Applicant: Acworth Highway 92 Partners, LLC


       This Modification of Zoning Conditions Application applies to parcels within
Property owned by the Applicant which is subject to Zoning Conditions as approved in
Resolution #05-04-030 which zoned the Property to the GC classification with conditions
and to the Ll classification with conditions. The Property totals approximately 42.37
acres and is comprised of County Tax Map 21N06 Parcels 030, 031, 032, 034, 036,
036A, 037 and 057.

   The Applicant requests a Modification of Conditions to replace the Condition (9) as
currently written:

          (9) Buffers. The intent of buffers is to provide a year round visual screen such
          as evergreen trees between adjacent properties and the new development. Any
          application for a design plan approval submitted to the director of planning and
          zoning shall include a tree survey and landscape plan, with buffers, prepared
          by a landscape architect.

With the following new Condition (9):

          (9) Buffers. The intent of buffers is to provide a year round visual screen such
          as evergreen trees between adjacent properties and the new development. Any
          application for a design plan approval submitted by a landscape architect to the
          director of planning and zoning shall include a tree survey and landscape plan,
          with buffers as required by the Zoning Ordinance, however, grading of the
          thirtv-five foot buffer between GC zoned property and AG zoned property is
          permitted provided said buffers are restored by planting of vegetation to
          achieve a year round visual screen as approved by Cherokee County Staff.



       A similar Modification to reduce the undisturbed buffer between Ll and AG from
50 feet to 3 5 feet and to allow grading within the buffer was approved on May 1, 2007.
The Applicant erroneously believed that the prior Modification also allowed disturbance
within the 35-foot buffer that exists between GC and AG. Plans were prepared and the
deal to bring the proposed Cabela's store to Cherokee County was based on this
erroneous belief. Unless approval to grade within the 35-foot buffer between GC and AG

                                            1
is granted, a large and very expensive wall would have to be constructed or the location
of the Cabela's building would have to be altered, both of which are not acceptable under
the agreement with Cabela's. Since the intent of the buffer is to provide a year round
visual screen to protect AG property owners from commercial development and since, in
this case, the AG zoned property is owned by the Corps of Engineers and will never be
developed, the Applicant is seeking this Modification of Conditions that would allow the
buffer to be graded and then restored. The net effect will be to continue to provide the
visual screen called for in the Zoning Ordinance but to allow the temporary disturbance
of the buffer to minimize the adverse effect this buffer requirement will have on the
commercial development of Cherokee Village. Therefore, the Applicant respectfully
requests that the language of Condition (9) be altered as proposed.

                               CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIONS


        Georgia Law and the procedures of Cherokee County require us to raise Federal and State
Constitutional objections during the rezoning application process.           While the Applicant
anticipates a smooth application process, failure to raise constitutional objections at this stage
may mean that the Applicant will be baned from raising impotiant legal claims later in the
process. Accordingly, we are required to raise the following constitutional objections at this
time:
        A denial of the Application would be unconstitutional in that it would destroy the
Owner's property rights without first paying fair, adequate, and just compensation for such
rights, in violation of Article I, Section I, Paragraph I of the Constitution of the State of Georgia
of 1983, Article I, Section III, Paragraph I of the Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1983 and
the Due Process Clause of the Fomieenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
        Any application of the Code of Cherokee County, or the Zoning Ordinance of Cherokee
County, to the Subject Property that prohibits the Owner from developing the Subject Property
as proposed is unconstitutional, illegal, null, and void because such an application constitutes a
taking of the Owner's property in violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, Atiicle I, Section I, Paragraph I, and Atiicle
I, Section III, Paragraph I, of the Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1983 and a violation of
the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fomieenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States because such an application denies the Owner an economically viable use of
its land while not substantially advancing legitimate state interests.
        A denial of this Application would also constitute an arbitrary and capricious act by the
Cherokee County Board of Commissioners without any rational basis therefore, thereby
constituting an abuse of discretion in violation of Atiicle I, Section I, Paragraph I of the
Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1983, Article I, Section III, Paragraph I of the
Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1983 and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
        A refusal by the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners to grant the Application
would be unconstitutional and discriminate in an arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable manner
between the Owner and owners of similarly situated propetty in violation of At·ticle I, Section I,
Paragraph II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1983 and the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fomieenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Any approval of the
Application that subjects the Subject Propetiy to conditions that are different from the conditions
requested by the Owner, to the extent such different conditions would have the effect of fmiher
restricting the Owner's utilization of the Subject Propetiy, would also constitute an arbitrary,
capricious, and discriminatory act in zoning the Subject Property to an unconstitutional category
and would likewise violate each of the provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions set fotih
hereinabove.
         In addition, this constitutes formal written notice to Cherokee County, pursuant to
O.C.G.A. § 36-11-1, that the Owner plans to seek to recover all damages that it sustains or suffer
as a result of the denial of this Application and/or the unconstitutional zoning of the Subject
Propetiy from Cherokee County. Such damages may include, but are not necessarily limited to,
damages related to the diminution in the value of the Subject Propetiy, attorneys' fees and
expenses of litigation.
         Accordingly, the Owner respectfully requests that the Cherokee County Board of
Commissioners grant the Application as requested.


                                               Respectfully submitted,

        The reasoning behind my request to modify the current zoning conditions at the address 911
Bridgemill Ave. is to allow room for a back deck to be built on the rear of the proposed house. With the
current 25 foot undisturbed buffer in the rear of the lot, there is barely enough room to fit a house
inside the building envelope that would be compatible with the rest of the existing homes already built
on the street. Furthermore, it leaves no room for a rear deck, patio, or backyard what-so-ever. I am
requesting that for this particular lot, the undisturbed buffer and building line be moved back 15 feet so
that private, rear-living, and rear egress can be accommodated for this home. I shall agree to replant an
evergreen vegetative buffer along the edges of the newly proposed building line at time of landscaping
so as to minimize the impact ofthe encroachment on the existing buffer line.

Date Submitted:                 9/11/2013
Submitted By:                   Kristi Thompson
Contract Number:                2013-29
Period of Performance:          October 2013- September 2016
Recommended Supplier Name:      CorrectHealth of Cherokee
General Project Description:    Inmate Medical Services for Adult Detention Center
Source of Funds:                Operations- General Fund ADC Org 3420

BACKGROUND/ SOURCE SELECTION:
   Formal RFP was solicited online and advertised for three weeks. Three companies
   submitted proposals. The overall ranking sheet based on individual selection committee
   members is attached.

      Cherokee County Business Involvement:
            [)SI  No CC Business submitted bid/proposal
            D     CC Business bid/proposal deemed non-responsive, not-responsible
            D     CC Business not within 5% of Low Bid {for consideration)


fAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION
   Annual prices for all minimum health, dental and mental health services outlined in the RFP
   were requested as well as a per diem price should the population increase and continue
   beyond a specified target number {600 inmates). The proposer with the lowest annual price
   and lowest per diem rate has an aggregate cap of $175,000 for off-site medical costs which
   at the specified target population of 600 inmates is less than $300/inmate. The other two
   proposers each have cap of $15,000/inmate for off-site medical costs {$9M annual cap).

   Considering off-site medical costs include ambulance transport and hospitalization costs, a
   cap of $300/inmate is not feasible. Additionally the difference between the lowest total
   annual cost and the recommended awarded provider is only $136,559 which does not allow
   enough of a savings to "make-up" the difference in the off-site medical cap.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
   The contract is a maximum 3-year term with auto renewals for years 2 and 3 unless
   terminated. The contract allows for a 60-day written termination notice for convenience.

RECOMMENDATION
   Support ranking by selection committee and recommend award to CorrectHealth.

                                   WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, COUNTY Is charged by law with the responsibility for obtaining and providing
reasonably necessary medical care for Inmates or detainees of the Cherokee County

WHEREAS, COUNTY desires to provide for health care to Inmates in accordance with

Board of Commissioners, desires to enter into this Agreement with COMPANY to
promote this objective; and,

WHEREAS, COMPANY Is in the business of providing correctional healthcare services
under contract and desires to provide such services for the COUNTY under the express
terms and conditions contained herein.

NOW THEREFORE, In consideration of the mutual covenants and promises hereinafter
made, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1: HEALTH CARE SERVICES

1.1    General Engagement. COUNTY hereby contracts with COMPANY to provide
       healthcare services to inmates of the ADULT DETENTION CENTER. This care is to
       be delivered to Individuals under the custody and control of the COUNTY at the
       ADULT DETENTION CENTER, and COMPANY enters Into this Agreement according
       to the terms and provisions herein. COMPANY agrees to provide such services.

1.2    Scope of General Services. The responsibility of COMPANY for the healthcare of
       an Inmate commences with the commitment of an Inmate to the custody of the
       COUNTY. COMPANY shall provide health care services for all persons committed
       to the custody of the COUNTY. COMPANY shall provide on a regular basis, all
       professional medical, mental health, dental, and related health care and
       administrative services for the Inmates, regularly scheduled sick call, nursing
       care, regular physician care, emergency medical care, emergency ambulance
       services when medically necessary, medical records management,
      pharmacy/prescription supply and services management, administrative support
      services, and other services, all as more specifically described herein.

1.3   Specialty Care Services. When non-emergency specialty care Is required and
      cannot be rendered at the ADULT DETENTION CENTER, COMPANY shall make
      arrangements with the COUNTY for the transportation of the Inmates in
      accordance with Section 1.8 of this Agreement.

1.4   On-Site Emergency Services. COMPANY shall provide, at Its own cost, on-site
      emergency medical care, as medically necessary.

1.5   InJuries Incurred Prior to Incarceration; Pregnancy. COMPANY will not be
      financially responsible for the cost of any medical treatment for health care
      services provided to any inmate prior to the inmate's commitment into the
      custody of the COUNTY. Furthermore, COMPANY is not financially responsible
      for the cost of services outside the ADULT DETENTION CENTER for any medical
      treatment or health care services provided to medically stabilize any inmate
      presented at booking with a life threatening Injury or illness or In Immediate
      need of emergency medical care.

      Once It has been determined by COMPANY's Intake medical personnel that the
      Inmate has been medically stabilized, and accepted by COUNTY personnel into
      the custody of the COUNTY, COMPANY will, commencing at that point, then
      become responsible for the medical treatment for health care services,
      regardless of the nature of the Illness or Injury and whether or not the Illness or
      Injury occurred prior or subsequent to the Individual's Incarceration at the
      ADULT DETENTION CENTER. An inmate shall be considered medically stabilized
      when the patient's medical condition no longer requires Immediate emergency
      medical care or outside hospitalization, and when any and/or all applicable
      medical clearances have been provided to the COUNTY ADULT DETENTION
      CENTER personnel, so that the inmate can reasonably be housed Inside the
      ADULT DETENTION CENTER.

      It Is expressly understood that COMPANY shall not be responsible for medical
      costs associated with the medical care of any infants born to inmates.
      COMPANY shall provide health care services to inmates up to, through, and after
      the birth process, but health care services provided to an infant following birth,
      other than those services that may be delivered In the ADULT DETENTION
      CENTER prior to transport to a hospital, will not be the financial responsibility of
      COMPANY. In any event, COMPANY shall not be responsible for the costs
      associated with the performing or furnishing of elective abortions.

1.6   Inmates outside the Facility. The health care services contracted In the
      Agreement are Intended only for those Inmates In the actual physical custody of



                                           2

       prisons outside of the COUNTY. Such Inmates are not to be Included In the daily
       population count. No person(s), Including those who are in any outside hospitals
       who are not under guard, shall be the financial responsibility of COMPANY with
       respect to the payment or the furnishing of their health care services.

       while on such temporary release, work release, or escape status will not be the
       responsibility of COMPANY. However, inmates on work detail who are
       supervised by county personnel and become Injured will be the responsibility of
       COMPANY as long as they are returned to the facility to be treated by COMPANY

Date Submitted:                9/11/2013
Submitted By:                  Kristi Thompson
Contract Number:               2013-30
Period of Performance:         October 2013- September 2016
Recommended Supplier Name:     Trinity Services Group
General Project Description:   Food Services for Adult Detention Center
Source of Funds:               Operations- General Fund ADC Org 3420

BACKGROUND/ SOURCE SELECTION:
   Formal RFP was solicited online and advertised for three weeks. Three companies
   submitted proposals. One company submitted a "no bid" response leaving two companies
   to be evaluated. The overall ranking sheet based on individual selection committee
   members is attached.

      Cherokee County Business Involvement:
            [8:1  No CC Business submitted bid/proposal
            D     CC Business bid/proposal deemed non-responsive, not-responsible
            D     CC Business not within 5% of Low Bid (for consideration)

FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION
   Prices were requested on a sliding scale because weekly meal totals can vary greatly based
   on inmate population. The total annual expenditure for FY2013 has increased due to
   increased population in the Jail compared to previous years.

   Over the last three years, the highest weekly meal total was 13,426. Therefore the pricing
   was compared for the 12,601 to 14,700 Meals per Week. While Trinity's price per meal is
   higher by $0.03 ($0.823/meal) than that of ABL Management's price per meal
   ($0. 794/meal), the quality of food being offered as well as the choice selection.

   Additionally the meals proposed for the Jail personnel (at the same price per meal) is a
   healthier choice than that proposed by the other offeror and therefore in line with the
   County's Well ness Initiatives for its employees.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
   The contract is a maximum 3-year term with auto renewals for years 2 and 3 unless
   terminated. The contract allows for a 45-day written termination notice for convenience.

RECOMMENDATION
   Support ranking by selection committee and recommend award to Trinity Services Group.

 OFFICE OF    DEVELOP~~ENT




              29 August 2013


              Mr. Jeny Cooper, County Manager
              Cherokee County Board of Commissioners
              1130 Bluffs Parkway
              Canton, GA 30114

              Dear Mr. Cooper,

              Thank you for your assistance in securing Inalfa Roof Systems at our anchor tenant in the
              new Cherokee 75 Corporate Park. As you know, we are working with Rooker to develop
              the 165,444 square foot facility at 1000 Cherokee Parkway, Acworth. The Development
              Service Center has provided excellent care during the course of the project thus far, which
              has been imperative due to the compressed construction schedule.

              Because of the competiveness of this project, we respectfully request a 50% reduction in
              impact fees. As you know, we were competing with an existing building in LaVergne,
              Tennessee. Based on the impact fee schedule, their 165,444 sq ft building would be
              required to pay an impact fee of $95,957.52. The rate is calculated by using the new rate
              for Manufacturing of $0.58 per square foot. Since this is a regional headquarters,
              manufacturing and distribution facility, it does qualify for a reduction or waiver.

              Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you for your consideration.

I.    Introductions- Gary Caviness

II.   Impact Fee Basics Presentation- Margaret Stallings
Margaret Stallings presented a quick overview of Impact Fees, including a detailed description,
process for calculating what to charge, State Code information, and the roles & responsibilities of
county staff I board members.

Ill. Application for Partial Impact Fee Waiver for lnalfa Roof Systems project
Misti Martin from the Cherokee Office of Economic Development and Alan Gray from Rooker and
Associates presented information about the project. They discussed the need for a 50% waiver
of the total impact fees due to the extraordinary economic impact on SW Cherokee and the
County as a whole. After a series of questions and answers with member of the board, Carrie
McKinney made a motion to recommend approval to the Board of Commissioners of the 50%
waiver as requested. Mark Marlow seconded the motion. There was a brief discussion. Board
members voted 4-0 to recommend approval.

IV. Election of Chairperson
Mark Marlow nominated Carrie McKinney to serve as the chairperson because of her previous
experience on the board. Adam Dreyer seconded the nomination. Carrie McKinney accepted the
nomination. The board members voted 4-0 to elect Carrie McKinney as the Chairperson.

V. Setting a Standing Meeting Day & Time
Gary Caviness brought up the need to set a regular monthly meeting day and time so a regular
process can be followed for future applications. Carrie McKinney suggested sticking with a
meeting on the 2nd week of the month between the two BOG meetings so applications for waivers
and credits could easily move on to the BOG for final decisions without significant delay. The rest
of the board agreed with this idea and settled on the 2nd Monday of the month at 5:30pm. Gary
Caviness indicated that the meetings would be tentatively scheduled until county staff sent out a
confirmation to board members. Meetings would only be held if there were applications to
consider.

                                           We were able to find the same vehicle router device proposed by Utlity on the CDWG
                                           website. By purchastng the device directly from Utility, the County saves approximately
                                           $1373.06 per router kit. We were also able to find a similar-use router on the same
                                           website for $2207.46 per router, which Is approximately $_1212.46 more than the
                                           proposed router from Utility. Both of these price comparison found on the website do
                                           not reflect warranty/service and hardware Installation.

Evaluation to Real World Test Criteria:
The Fire Department developed a set of evaluation criteria to measure camera effectiveness under likely conditions.
The first place camera was acceptable In all categories while the second place camera raised concerns with its incomplete
passing of the heat test, but scored well in other areas of performance. Feature for feature these were the most
comparable cameras.
The balance of the cameras were acceptable in some areas and problematic in other areas for actual deployment given
that most did poorly in the heat resistance evaluation.

SUBJECT:        County Insurance Contract Renewal                  MEETING DATE: 18-Sep-13

SUBMITTED BY:            Dale Jordan

COl'viMISSION ACTION REQUESTED:
Approve the contract renewal of the County's Property and Casualty Insurance Program through Insurance
Office of America for coverage by One Beacon.

FACTS AND ISSUES:
The County's insurance coverage is contracted on an annual basis and addresses coverage for General Liability
(including excess liability), Automotive, Property, Inland Marine, Law Enforcement, Public Officials and
Firefighters AD&D.

The total cost of coverage for the current year was $670,714. The Proposed insurance for the FY2014 is
$694,390, up $23,676- or approximately 3.5% over last year. The previous two years the premiums were up
slightly over 5% per year.

As a reference and to substantiate the reasonableness ofthe IONOne Beacon pricing, the County obtained an
email price from Leavitt Group of Atlanta for coverage through Berkley for a premium of$743,449. While the
representation was that it provided similar coverage- due to time constraints no formal proposal was received
or evaluated.

This coverage will be bound upon the BoC's approval with effectively and the first qumter's payment due
01-0ct-13.

    Mr. Jerry Cooper
    Mr. Dale Jordan
    Cherokee County Board of Commissioners
    1430 Bluffs Parkway
    Canton, GA 30114

    RE: 2013 - 2014 Property and Casualty Insurance Program

    Gentlemen,

    Enclosed you will find our proposal for the armual renewal of Cherokee County's
    Property and Casualty Insurance Program. As always, we have used the updated
    schedules for your property, equipment and fleet exposures that have been developed by
    lOA and the County's Risk Management Department to determine the premiums for
    those exposures, and the County's website fmancial information to develop the premiums
    for the General Liability as well as the Public Officials, Law Enforcement and
    Employment Practices Liabilities. Additionally, we have combined lOA's expertise with
    the staff at Public Entities of America to offer Cherokee County what we feel is a service
    team that is second to none.

    As we have done in the past, we have approached several other insurance carriers for
    optional proposals/quotes, but none have been as competitive as has One Beacon, and for
    the past several years. The Travelers Insurance Co. has, once again, adopted a minimum
    increase in their rates of no less than 5%, with their rates already significantly higher than
    One Beacon's rates for the past several years; Trident Insurance Co. is still assessing
    accounts with large property schedules (their definition of"large", that is) to the point of
    being non-competitive, overall, by as much as 15- 20%. Additionally, several other
    "start-up" programs (i.e. QBE) have either left the state after being non-profitable for 3
    years, or have what we consider administrative issues, such as: Out-of-state third party
    claims administrators, or un-seasoned representation by newly appointed agents, or use
    "pass-through" insurance companies fronting for un-regulated fmancial entities. In any
    case, we found no other viable options that would competitively fit with the program that
    Cherokee Co. currently has when considering the fmancial backing and expertise of One
    Beacon and lOA.

    This year's total annualized premium is up approximately 3.5% ($23,676) over last year's
    total. (Keep in mind that there may be some small increases or decreases in some of the
    premiums due to changes in the county's exposures between today and October 1, 2013,
    when the policy actually takes effect.) However, within that 3.5% overall increase is an
    increase in your Property Limit from $128.7mil+/- to $153.7mil +/-(a 19.5% increase);




                            678-919-1150 · 678-919-1151 Fax · 1-800-535-4305

(
    an increase of $105k +/-(a 1.8% increase) in your equipment schedule; an increase from
    570 to 603 units on your fleet schedule (a 5.8% increase); and various increases in your
    Liability exposures ranging from increased revenues to additional exposures like the
    Aquatic Center. Basically, the RATES for most aspects of your overall program are
    actually down from last year; the rating BASIS for those aspects (as pointed out above)
    have increased, thus resulting in what we consider to be a very competitive pricing
    model.

    With One Beacon offering what we consider to be one of the best, if not THE best, policy
    of coverages in the Public Entity Sector, and their keeping their rates competitively low
    due to Cherokee's desirable loss history, we are more than pleased with their proposal,
    and willingness to work with us to provide this program.

    As in the past, I want to thank Cherokee's staff for working with us during this past year,
    and hope that you will continue to allow us to be of service for this next year, and many
    year's going forward.

    Sincerely,

Jerry/Dale,

Enclosed you should fmd copies of my cover letter and the
Premium/Losses review that you should now insert into your
proposal binders from yesterday, and destroy the originals that
were included to prevent any future confusion. I can only
apologize, once again, for my not making sure that the information
contained in those two documents was correct and then re-checked
for accuracy before including them in your proposals. I choose to
believe it won't happen again! I could spend more of your time re-
explaining the reasons, but I think you've heard enough of my
personal situation.

As Dale and I discussed this morning, Savannah Shadbum and I
spent several hours yesterday going over and verifying the various
property listings that Jerry brought up on Monday, and other
aspects of the proposal that the three of us discussed in meeting. It
appears that we have not been updating those schedules as I had
assumed. There are locations on the policy schedule that should
have been deleted; there were locations that are not located in the
county's records that we show on the policy schedule, and that are
surely in existence (i.e. fire stations); there are locations that have
remodeled, but the new valuations have not been entered (i.e. one
location was listed at+/- $150k on the policy schedule, but has a
renovated value on the county's asset list of over $1mil.). And, the
old Macedonia elementary school gym is, in fact, listed on the
policy schedule.

           2839 Paces Ferry Road, Suite 1200 · Atlanta, GA 30339 · www.ioausa.com
So, there is are many aspects of the property schedule that need
addressing. The Equipment Schedule is, for the most part, up to
date. And, the Fleet is apparently up to date as well.

All of this being said, I would suggest that we submit the proposal,
in it's current form, for approval, and make the necessary changes
to the property schedule as soon as Savannah can complete her
updates to the schedule. I realize that this is not the most ideal way
to proceed, but in view of the facts that have just come to be
known, I can't make a better suggestion. I'm open to suggestions,
and will wait to hear from you as to how you want to proceed.

Thanks again for allowing me to be of service.

Buddy

                                        Agenda Request


SUBJECT:        Juvenile Reinvestment Grant Program                        MEETING DATE: 9/17/2013

SUBMITTED BY: Amy Turcotte, Juvenile Comt

COMMISSION ACTION REQUESTED:

Accept federal Juvenile Reinvestment Grant Agreement JBR-10-01-003 in the amount of $110,000 and
authorize the corresponding Budget Amendment allocating grant monies to the County's adopted FY13
Budget.


FACTS AND ISSUES:

On June 18, 2013 the Board authorized the Juvenile Court to apply for federal funding under the Juvenile
Reinvestment Grant Program (JRGP). This Program is administered by the State of Georgia Governor's Office
for Children and Families (GOCF) and the funds are derived from the US Department of Justice (DOJ). The
CFDA numbers for this grant are: 16.523 and 16.540.

In August, the County was notified that the application was awarded in the amount of$100,000. Cherokee
County was the only agency to receive the full amount of grant funds requested. The grant does require a cash
match of $10,000 and in-kind services match of $24,431 as per the attached SFY14 Approved Budget
Summary. The $10,000 cash match will come from the Juvenile Court Program Fees (accnt 100-12711 ~). The
in-kind services match will come from the Juvenile Court (Org 2600) annual budget (14% of personnel costs
for a JRGP Coutt Manager and miscellaneous operational expenses) and Highland Rivers it1-kind contribution
of$13,008 (office space, supplies, equipment).

The grant Agreement has been signed by the Chairman (attached) and returned to the GOCF due to time
constraints imposed by the State. The adopted FY13 Budget needs to be amended to accept the grant funds
and establish a project budget for this program.

The grant monies are to be utilized for the Cherokee Bridging the Gap Program which supports reducing the
commitments of the Department of Juvenile Justice short term program in accordance with House Bill242-
Juvenile Comt Reform. The Cherokee Bridging the Gap Program is a coordinated effort between the Juvenile
Court of Cherokee County, Cherokee Department ofFamily and Children Services, Cherokee County School
District, Cherokee Department of Juvenile Justice and Highland Rivers Health. The federal grant monies are to
be used to fund the salary (including fringe) of a Mental Health Coordinator and for the implementation of
Functional Family Therapy (inclusive of7 Challenges Program therapy). These services will be provided by
Highland Rivers Health, as per the grant application and award. While, the Mental Health Coordinator is not a
County position, the Juvenile Comt will be pmt ofthe hiring committee and the Coordinator will report to the
JRGP Court Manager (Amy Turcotte).

APPLICANT RESPONSE STATEMENT
ANNEXATIONS AND REZONINGS

     1) Explain the intent of the requested zoning.

        The applicant proposes a residential subdivision at a density of less than three
        units per acre to create a residential neighborhood that will have an amenity
        package, walking trails and preservation of the lake and surrounding properties as
        a natural area.

2)      Whether the zoning proposal will pcrlllit 11 use that is suitnble in view of the
        use and development of adjacent and nearby property.

        The developed properties in the area have developed into medium density
        reside!ltial subdivisions.    The proposed neighborhood is consistent with
        developments in the city just South of the subject property on Trickum Road.

3)      How the proposed zoning will adversely affect the existing use or usability of
        adjacent or ne11rby property.

        The proposed neighborhood will not adversely affect the usability of adjacent
        property. The applicant will propose adequate buffers in areas where needed.

4)      Whether the property to be affected by a proposed zoning has a reasonable
        economic use as currently zoned.

        The property does not have a reasonable economic use as zoned. To create the
        neighborhood and preserve the lake requires the lots proposed to maintain the
        amenity package and lake area.

5)      Whether the proposed zoning will result in a usc which will Ol' could cause an
        excessive ot· burdensome use of existing streets, b·ansportation facilities,
        utilities o1· schools.

        A development at a density of less than three units per acre will not create an
        excessive bmden on the existing public infrastructure.

6)      Whether the proposed zoning is In conformity with the policy and interest of
        the land use plan.

        The property is not covered by the City Land Use Plan because it is located in the
        Co\mty. Although the County Land Use Plan places the propetty it· the Suburban
        Growth Character area. The predominate Character Area in the area is Suburban
        Living, which the proposal is consistent with. There is no planning reason to
     place Suburban Growth between the developments within the City and
     subdivisions that are developed as Suburban Living in the County.

7)   Whether there nrc other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and
     development of the property which give $11pporting grounds for either
     approval or disapproval of the proposed zoning.

     There is a demand for the creation of neighborhoods in this area. Not just
     subdivisions, but neighborhoods that have an amenity package and a natural area
     to gather and recreate.

Introduction

This study assesses the traffic impact that will result from the development of property along the north and
south sides of Barnes Road and the east side of Trickum Road in Cherokee County, Georgia. The property is
proposed to be annexed into the City of Woodstock and rezoned from R-40 to R2-Conservation Subdivision. The
location of the property is shown in Figure 1. The property consists of two tracts, a North Tract and a South
Tract, divided by Barnes Road. The North Tract will be developed with 134 single family homes and the South
Tract will include 83 single family homes. Vehicular access to the North Tract will be provided at two driveways,
the western of which will align with the one access to the South Tract, and the eastern of which will align with
River Oaks Drive.

In this study, existing traffic conditions in the vicinity of the proposed development are documented. Traffic
volume projections for the development are calculated and the future conditions are assessed. Conclusions are
presented which identify existing and potential future deficiencies and recommendations are made in order to
mitigate those deficiencies. The objective of the recommendations is to ensure safe and efficient existing and
future traffic operations in the vicinity of the proposed development. The scope of this study was developed in
agreement with the City of Woodstock.

Existing Traffic Conditions
Existing traffic operating conditions in the vicinity of the proposed residential subdivision were reviewed. The
following is a brief description of the existing conditions.

Description of Roadway Facilities

Barnes Road will provide vehicular access to the proposed project. It is a two lane collector road that begins to
the west at Trickum Road, where the fourth (west) approach is School Drive which is the entrance to Little River
Elementary School. The intersection of Barnes Road and Trickum Road is signal controlled. Barnes Road
continues to the northeast, has an actuated signal at Cherokee County Fire Station 7 (only actuates during an
emergency) and has a signalized intersection with Arnold Mill Road, north of which the facility changes name to
North Arnold Mill Road, continues to the east, and eventually re-intersects with Arnold Mill Road. The posted
speed limit on Barnes Road is 35 mph and the terrain is curving and gently rolling. Photograph 1 faces east
toward the intersection of Trickum / Barnes from School Drive. Photograph 2 faces east along Barnes Road from
the approximate location of the proposed site access to the North and South Tracts. The Fire Station and its
signal are visible. Photograph 3 shows the view from the proposed east site access to the North Tract, aligning
with River Oaks Drive, while Photograph 4 shows the view from the same location, facing east. Photograph 5
faces north along Barnes Road at Arnold Mill Road.

The photographs and field observations reveal the potential for notable intersection sight distance limitations at
the location of both proposed project accesses. At the east access location, aligning with River Oaks Drive, the
line of sight for the future exit from the North Tract appears to be clear to the west (right), but is notably limited
(to approximately 150 feet) to the east due to curvature of the road and dense vegetation. At the west access
location, where the access to the North and South Tracts will meet, the line of sight is notably limited in both
directions by both curvature of the road and dense vegetation. It is recommended that the project access
locations be carefully chosen, and vegetation be pruned as appropriate, so as to ensure sufficient intersection
lines of sight, in both directions, from all exiting approaches.

Trickum Road begins as a local residential street north of Arnold Mill Road, has a signalized intersection with
Arnold Mill Road, then continues south as a two lane collector, turns to the west, and intersects with State
Route (SR) 92 at a signalized intersection. Trickum Road then continues south for some distance, to Sandy Plains
Road. In the vicinity of the proposed development, Trickum Road has gently rolling terrain and a posted speed
limit of 40 mph. However, the speed limit is reduced to 30 mph from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. near the
elementary school, and another school zone is found on Trickum Road near the Cherokee Christian School,
closer to Arnold Mill Road. Photograph 6 shows the section of Trickum Road just north of SR 92, where the road
widens to provide multiple left turn lanes and decel lanes at the various retail properties in that area.

it continues to Alpharetta. This traffic study evaluates the two signalized intersections of Arnold Mill Road at
Trickum Road and at Barnes Road. In the study area, Arnold Mill Road has a posted speed limit of 45 mph and
the terrain is gently rolling and curving. This section of Arnold Mill Road has been recently resurfaced and has
not yet been fully striped. It is also noted that the street name sign in the southeast corner of Arnold Mill /
Trickum is notably east of Trickum Road, set back from the roadway, such that it is difficult to observe from
northbound Trickum Road. Photograph 7 looks west along Arnold Mill Road near Trickum Road.

State Route 92 is a major east/west arterial through this section of northwest Georgia. At its signalized
intersection with Trickum Road, SR 92 has two through travel lanes and exclusive left and right turn lanes (dual
eastbound left turn lanes) and a posted speed limit of 45 mph. Photograph 8 faces west along SR 92 near
Trickum Road. It was noted that the pedestrian signal head in the northeast corner of the intersection was
exceptionally highly mounted. That may be to ensure visibility across SR 92 in the event that a truck is stopped
across the crosswalk, perhaps turning right onto Trickum Road. However, the height of the signal is well above
the typical field of view of a crossing pedestrian.

Transit, Pedestrian, and Bicycle Accessibility

The transportation system in this area is automobile-focused. There are no sidewalks along Barnes Road.
Sidewalk exists along the west side of Trickum Road from Barnes Road to a short distance to the south, including
at the entrance to the Little River Elementary School, and there are crosswalks and pedestrian signals on all four
legs of the Trickum / Barnes intersection. However, the sidewalk, oddly, does not continue into the school along
School Drive. There is no sidewalk along Arnold Mill Road in this vicinity. Sidewalk does appear along both sides
of Trickum Road closer to SR 92 and along both sides of SR 92 in this vicinity. Cherokee County operates CATS
(Cherokee Area Transportation System) which operates primarily in the Canton area. There is no public mass-
transit service to the vicinity of the proposed subdivision. No dedicated bicycle lanes are found on the roads in
the vicinity of the site.

Existing Traffic Volumes

Existing full turning movement traffic volume counts were collected at the following intersections:

                  Trickum Road and Barnes Road
                  Barnes Road and River Oaks Drive
                  Arnold Mill Road and Trickum Road
                  Arnold Mill Road and Barnes Road
                  State Route (SR) 92 and Trickum Road

The counts were collected on Thursday, August 15, 2013 at all intersections except Barnes Road and River Oaks
Drive, which was counted on Wednesday, August 21, 2013. Area schools were in session on the dates of the
counts. The morning counts were collected from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and the evening counts were performed
from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. From the count data, the highest four consecutive 15-minute interval volumes in
each time period were determined. These volumes make up the typical peak hour traffic volumes. The existing
peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 2 and the raw count data is found in Appendix B.

In addition to the turning movement counts, 2012 Georgia DOT annual average daily traffic (AADT) volumes
were obtained for available count locations in the vicinity. These 24-hour counts are presented in Table 1.

Existing Intersection Operations

Existing traffic operations were analyzed at the counted intersections using Synchro software, version 8, in
accordance with the methodologies presented in the Transportation Research Board'  s 2010 Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM 2010). The HCM 2010 methodologies for signalized and unsignalized intersections are
summarized in Appendix A. The results of the analysis are shown in Table 2. Computer printouts containing
detailed results of the analysis are located in Appendix C. Levels of service are provided for the overall
intersection and for each controlled approach and/or controlled movement.

The analysis of the existing condition reveals acceptable operations during the p.m. peak, with some notable
delays in the morning peak hour. At the Trickum / Barnes intersection, the morning level of service (LOS) is F,
including LOS F for traffic exiting the elementary school and for vehicles on westbound Barnes Road. The Arnold
Mill / Trickum intersection also operates at LOS F in the a.m. peak hour. Delays are notable at the SR 92 /

Trickum intersection in the morning, as well. The Arnold Mill / Barnes and Barnes / River Oaks intersections
operate acceptably.

It is noted here that the analysis methodology evaluates operations at the hours at which the volumes are the
highest and, therefore, operations are at their worst. In cases where peaking is acute, the peak operations can
be significantly worse than general operations throughout the balance of the day. This is the case at some of
these intersections, most notably the Trickum / Barnes intersection in the a.m. peak hour. The fourth approach
at this intersection is the access to Little River Elementary School. The school has little impact in the evening
peak hour and the intersection operates at LOS B in the evening. However, in the morning, the school drop-off
activity creates acute peaking, with vehicles entering to drop off students, then those same vehicles exiting the
property. It is this acute peak that is reflected in the LOS F in the a.m. peak hour. The acute area peaking is also
seen at the Arnold Mill / Trickum intersection, which operates at LOS C in the evening, but also experiences LOS
F during the acute a.m. peak. Observations at other times of the day reveal excellent operations at all of these
intersections.

At the Trickum / Barnes intersection, exclusive left and right turn lanes are provided on all approaches except
the westbound, which has no exclusive right turn lane. The westbound right turn volume is extremely low, and,
therefore, the addition of this lane would have minimal benefit. Additional capacity would be beneficial for the
westbound left turn movement, but there is no second southbound through lane on Trickum Road to receive
dual left turns from Barnes Road. A second through lane in each direction on Trickum Road would also be
beneficial to accommodate southbound through volumes in the morning and northbound through volumes in
the evening. If Trickum Road was widened to a four lane road and westbound Barnes Road had a dual left turn
lane, the intersection would operate at LOS D in the a.m. and LOS A in the p.m. It is again noted that these extra
lanes would have the most benefit in alleviating the acute a.m. peak. During the balance of the day, including
the p.m. peak hour, this intersection operates well.

At the Arnold Mill / Trickum intersection the LOS F in the a.m. is contributed to by the heavy northbound left
turn from Trickum Road and the heavy eastbound right turn from Arnold Mill Road. Alternative phasing
combinations were tested in the analysis, including a north / south split phasing with an eastbound right turn
overlap, but, ultimately, in order to achieve acceptable operations in the a.m., additional lane capacity is
needed. This could include a second eastbound right turn lane and/or a northbound dual left turn lane.
However, each of these second turn lanes would require a second receiving lane, which would entail the
widening of southbound Trickum Road south of Arnold Mill Road or the widening of westbound Arnold Mill
Road west of Trickum Road. Again, these improvements are primarily beneficial to alleviate the acute a.m. peak,
and this intersection operates well during the balance of the day.

The City of Woodstock Transportation Plan includes an anticipated widening of Trickum Road, in conjunction
with Cherokee County, from two to four lanes from Arnold Mill Road to the Cobb County line / Jamerson Road.
The plan does not include an anticipated date for this project to begin.

Proposed Residential Subdivision Traffic Characteristics

This section describes the anticipated traffic characteristics of the proposed residential development, including a
site description, how much traffic the project will generate, and where that traffic will travel.

Project Description

The subject property is located on the north and south sides of Barnes Road and the east side of Trickum Road in
Cherokee County. The property is proposed to be annexed into the City of Woodstock and rezoned from R-40 to
R2-Conservation Subdivision. The property consists of two tracts, a North Tract and a South Tract, divided by
Barnes Road. The North Tract will be developed with 134 single family homes and the South Tract will include
83 single family homes. Vehicular access to the North Tract will be provided at two driveways, the western of
which will align with the one access to the South Tract and the eastern of which will align with River Oaks Drive.
A site plan is presented in Figure 3.

Trip Generation

Trip generation is an estimate of the number of entering and exiting vehicular trips that will be generated by the
proposed development. The trip generation was calculated using standard rates and equations from the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th edition. ITE Land Use 210 ­ Single-Family
Detached Housing was chosen as the most representative use for this project. The trip generation calculations
are summarized in Table 3.

Trip Distribution and Assignment

The trip distribution percentages indicate what proportion of the project'  s trips will travel to and from various
directions. The trips were distributed based on expected trip attractors (such as SR 92, downtown Woodstock, I-
575, neighboring cities, downtown Atlanta, and area schools, businesses, and retail) and the routes of travel to
those locations. The project traffic, shown in Table 3, was distributed to the roadway network based on these
percentages. The total peak hour trips expected to be generated solely by the project, and the trip distribution
percentages, are shown in Figure 4.

Future Traffic Conditions
This section describes the anticipated future traffic conditions after the proposed subdivision is fully built-out.
The counted traffic volumes, presented in Figure 2, were increased by a background growth factor of three
percent per year, or a total of 9.27% to account for other growth and development in the region. The traffic
that will be generated by the proposed subdivision, as shown in Figure 4, was added to these increased traffic
volumes to produce the future volumes at the study intersections, including the proposed site accesses on
Barnes Road. These future volumes are shown in Figure 5.

Future Intersection Operations

A future operational analysis was performed for each study intersection, as well as the proposed site driveways
on Barnes Road, for the condition with the proposed subdivision fully built-out. For comparison purposes, an
analysis was also performed for the future no-build scenario, which includes the anticipated background traffic
growth in the area, but does not include the traffic from the subject proposed subdivision. Table 4 presents the
results of the future no-build and build analyses, along with the results of the existing analysis that were
presented earlier.

As with the existing analysis, the study intersections will generally operate acceptably in the evening peak, and
through most of the day, but notable delays will be experienced at the Trickum / Barnes and Arnold Mill /
Trickum intersections in the future morning peak hour. The same mitigation that was discussed for the existing

condition will still be applicable in the future at Trickum / Barnes and Arnold Mill / Trickum. Future delays will
be mitigated by the anticipated widening of Trickum Road from two to four lanes, as indicated in the City of
Woodstock Transportation Plan. One interesting change in LOS is noted here, specifically the morning levels of
services at the Trickum / Barnes intersection. The overall intersection LOS remains LOS F from existing to no-
build to build during the acute a.m. peak, as do the eastbound and westbound approaches. However, the
northbound and southbound approaches on Trickum Road will experience a deterioration in LOS between the
existing and no-build conditions, but then a slight improvement from the no-build to build condition. This is
attributed to the analysis methodology which reports delay in terms of seconds per vehicle. If additional
vehicles can be added and processed by the intersection without adding to the delay, then the delay per vehicle
actually decreases. Practically speaking, the change in operations during the acute morning peak would be
imperceptible in the future between a no-build and build condition.

Additionally, delays will become notable at the SR 92 / Trickum intersection in the future a.m., and for certain
approaches in the p.m. The greatest benefit at this intersection would be achieved by the addition of third
through lanes in each direction on SR 92. The volumes on SR 92 are cross-regional and significant. No such
widening was found in the Atlanta Regional Commission'        s (ARC' s) near-term 2012-2017 Transportation
Improvement Program or long-term 2040 Regional Transportation Plan. Adding the third through lane in each
direction would improve both a.m. and p.m. peak operations to LOS D. Absent that improvement, the widening
of Trickum Road through the SR 92 intersection will provide some relief, improving the future a.m. level of
service from LOS F to LOS E.

According to Georgia DOT standards (it is noted that Barnes Road is not a state route and, therefore, not under
Georgia DOT jurisdiction), for a two lane road, with a posted speed limit of 35 mph, and a daily volume of less
than 6,000 vehicles per day, the threshold greater than which an exclusive right turn lane should be provided is
200 right turn vehicles (RTV) per day. The total westbound right turn volume into both North Tract driveways is
expected to be about 175 RTV per day. Therefore, regardless of the split of right turners per day at each
driveway, both westbound approaches on Barnes Road do not meet the Georgia DOT standard for providing a
deceleration lane. However, it is advised that, due to the curving nature of Barnes Road, westbound
deceleration lanes should be provided where feasible. The site plan anticipates providing deceleration lanes in
both directions at the western access to the North and South Tracts, and for the westbound approach at the
eastern access to the North tract. The east access will intercept most of the westbound traffic on Barnes Road
to the North Tract and, therefore, while both volumes will be modest, the right turn volume into the North Tract
at the east driveway will be higher than that at the west driveway.

In the eastbound direction, the RTV per day at the west site access, into the South Tract, will be about 322 RTV
per day. This exceeds the Georgia DOT threshold of 200 RTV per day. Therefore, according to Georgia DOT
standards, an eastbound deceleration lane should be provided at the west access, and this decel lane is shown
on the site plan. The site plan also depicts short acceleration flares at the west access. These are not
recommended, but, rather, a simple radius should be provided.

The Georgia DOT standards were also reviewed for exclusive left turn lanes, again recognizing that Barnes Road

conditions on Barnes Road, a left turn lane should be provided when the left turn vehicles (LTV) per day exceed
300 vehicles per day. In the eastbound direction, the LTV per day into the North Tract will be about 525 LTV per
day, split between the two accesses. If evenly split, each access would have about 263 LTVs per day, which is
below the GDOT threshold. However, if drivers favor one access over the other, it is possible that the Georgia
DOT threshold may be exceeded at that favored access. It is anticipated that left turn volumes will somewhat
balance between the driveways and that, therefore, by Georgia DOT standards for state routes, eastbound left
turn lanes would not be required.

In the westbound direction at the west access, into the South Tract, the LTV per day will be about 107 LTV per
day. Therefore, no exclusive westbound left turn lane would be required, according to Georgia DOT standards,
at the west access. Based on the review of Georgia DOT left turn lane standards, it is concluded that no left turn
lanes are required in either direction, at either site access. However, due to the curving nature of Barnes Road,
left turn lanes should be provided where feasible.

The operational analysis indicates that a single exiting lane on both the northbound and southbound approaches
at the west access, and on the southbound approach at the east access, will operate acceptably. Therefore, one
entering and one exiting lane should be provided at all site accesses. The side street approaches exiting each
access should be controlled with a stop sign and stop bar.

The review of existing conditions noted that the section along Barnes Road where the site accesses will be
located is curving with gently rolling terrain. Notable potential intersection sight distance limitations were
observed at the proposed locations of all site accesses. Therefore, it is recommended that lines of sight be
checked when finalizing locations of site accesses, and the construction of the site accesses should ensure that
sufficient intersection sight distance is provided in both directions. In some cases, this may be achievable by the
removal of dense vegetation that lines the roadway. If that proves inadequate, additional measures may be
necessary, including advance warning signage and vehicle presence beacons.

Summary of Study Findings and Recommendations

The following is a discussion of the findings and the recommendations of this traffic study:

1. The existing intersection operations in the study area vary by location and time of day. All of the
   intersections operate acceptably in the evening peak hour, and throughout most of the day.

2. The Trickum / Barnes and Arnold Mill / Trickum intersections experience acute peaking in the a.m. and
   operate at LOS F at that time. This acute peaking is a result of general heavy morning traffic combined with
   school drop-off activity. The fourth approach of the Trickum / Barnes intersection is the entrance to the
   Little River Elementary School, and their drop-off operation heavily influences the morning LOS F. Both the
   Trickum / Barnes and Arnold Mill / Trickum intersections operate well in the p.m., and through the balance
   of the day.

3. SR 92 / Trickum intersection operates with notable delays in the a.m., though still in the acceptable range.

4. The intersections of Arnold Mill / Barnes and Barnes / River Oaks operate acceptably during all time periods.

5. In the future, delays will increase at each study intersection, partially attributable to general growth in the
   area, and partially attributable to the proposed subdivision.

6. At the Trickum / Barnes intersection, operations would be improved primarily by the addition of a second
   through lane in the northbound and southbound directions on Trickum Road, and secondarily by the
   addition of a second westbound left turn lane from Barnes Road at Trickum Road. This mitigation would
   have greatest benefit during the acute morning peak.

7. At the Arnold Mill / Trickum intersection, operations would be improved by providing a dual eastbound right
   turn lane on Arnold Mill Road to Trickum Road and/or by adding a second northbound exclusive left turn
   lane on Trickum Road at Arnold Mill Road. Again, these improvements would have most benefit during the
   acute morning peak.

8. At the SR 92 / Trickum intersection, the greatest improvement would result from the addition of third
   through lanes in each direction on SR 92. No plans for this improvement were listed in the ARC'
                                                                                                 s near- or
   long-term Transportation Improvement Programs.

9. The City of Woodstock Transportation Plan anticipates the widening of Trickum Road from two to four lanes
   from Arnold Mill Road to the Cobb County line at some point in the future, though no project start date is
   indicated. The addition of this lane will mitigate most of the delays identified at the Trickum / Barnes and
   Arnold Mill / Trickum intersections, and will provide some relief in the a.m. at the SR 92 / Trickum
   intersection.

10. An analysis of Georgia DOT right and left turn lane standards for state routes, which Barnes Road is not, was
    performed at the two site accesses to provide a guideline as to which auxiliary lanes should be provided.
    The analysis revealed that in the eastbound direction a deceleration lane meets the Georgia DOT standards
    on Barnes Road at the west access into the South Tract. Due to the meeting of this standard, and the
    curving character of Barnes Road, it is recommended that this eastbound exclusive right turn lane be
    provided at the west site access. The site plan shows this eastbound deceleration lane.

11. In the westbound direction, the Georgia DOT standards for deceleration lanes are not satisfied at either the
    east or west access into the North Tract. The site plan shows westbound deceleration lanes at the west and
    east accesses, and, due to the curving nature of Barnes Road, these deceleration lanes are recommended.

12. The analysis of the Georgia DOT left turn lane standards reveals that no exclusive left turn lane is required in
    either direction at either the west or east site access. However, due to the curving nature of Barnes Road,
    left turn lanes should be provided where feasible.

13. The site plan depicts short acceleration flares. These are not recommended, but, rather, a simple radius
    should be provided.

14. One entering and one exiting lane should be provided at all site driveways. The side street approaches
    exiting each driveway should be controlled with a stop sign and stop bar.

15. Notable potential intersection sight distance limitations were observed at the proposed locations of all site
    accesses. Site driveways should be constructed so as to ensure that sufficient intersection sight distance is
    provided in both directions.

Intersection Analysis Methodology

The methodology used for evaluating traffic operations at intersections is presented in the Transportation
Research Board'  s Highway Capacity Manual, 2010 edition (HCM 2010). Synchro 8 software, which emulates the
HCM 2010 methodology, was used for all analyses. The following is an overview of the methodology employed
for the analysis of signalized intersections and stop-sign controlled (unsignalized) intersections.


Signalized Intersections

The criteria for evaluating signalized intersections are capacity and level of service. The capacity analysis of an
intersection compares the volume of traffic using the various lane groups at the intersection to the capacity of
those lane groups. This produces a volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for each lane group. A v/c ratio greater than
1.0 indicates that the volume of traffic has exceeded the capacity available and indicates a temporary excess of
demand. The HCM 2010 methodology computes a critical v/c ratio for an intersection based on the critical lane
groups or approaches. This critical v/c ratio is an indication of overall intersection sufficiency.

Level of service for a signalized intersection is defined in terms of control delay per vehicle. For signalized
intersections, a composite intersection level of service is determined. The thresholds for each level of service
are higher for signalized intersections than for unsignalized intersections. This is attributable to a variety of
factors including expectation and acceptance of higher delays at signals, and the fact that drivers can relax when
waiting at a signal as opposed to having to remain attentive as they proceed through the unsignalized
intersection. The level of service criteria for signalized intersections are shown in Table A.

Unsignalized Intersections

The operations at an unsignalized intersection are defined in terms of levels of service. Level of service (LOS) is a
measure of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and lost travel time. Level of service for an
unsignalized intersection is defined in terms of control delay per vehicle. Control delay is that portion of delay
attributable to the control device and includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay,

and final acceleration delay. The delays at unsignalized intersections are based on gap acceptance theory,
factoring in availability of gaps, usefulness of the gaps, and the priority of right-of-way given to each traffic
stream.

Levels of service are assigned letters A through F. LOS A indicates operations with very low control delay while
LOS F describes operations with high control delay. LOS F is considered to be unacceptable by most drivers,
while LOS E is typically considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. The level of service criteria for
unsignalized intersections are presented in Table B.

                             PUBLIC HEARINGS AND PARTICIPATION

In accordance with law and policy, the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners frequently conducts Public
Hearings on a number of matters and issues. These Public Hearing rules are intended to ensure that the public
has the opportunity to participate fairly in the meeting while promoting the orderly, efficient, and effective flow
of the meeting.

                          Policies and Procedures for Conducting Public Hearings

1.     The Chairman shall announce the Public Hearing and call for motion and a second to open the Public
       Hearing; once approved by a vote of the majority, the Chairman will announce that the Public Hearing
       is now open and should call forth those persons who wish to speak in favor, against, or otherwise on
       the particular issue. The Chairman shall inform the public that all comments by proponents, opponents,
       or the public shall be made from the podium and that any individual making a comment should first give
       their name and address. The Chairman shall also inform the public that comments will only be received
       from the podium.

2.     Members of the public who wish to speak must sign up on the form provided prior to the
       commencement of the Public Hearing. Members of the public are expected to adhere to the rules of
       decorum outlined herein and in the Civility Code and should be informed of such at the beginning of the
       Public Hearing by the Chairman. There should be no vocal or boisterous demonstrations which will
       disrupt the orderly flow of the meeting. Any person(s) engaging in this type of behavior shall be ruled
       out of order by the Chairman and shall, at his/her discretion, be removed from the building.

3.     Time. Proponents and opponents are allowed fifteen (15) minutes per side to present data, evidence,
       and opinions. Each side's time period may be divided among multiple speakers in whatever manner
       desired. No petition shall be the subject of more than one (1) public hearing before the Board of
       Commissioners regardless of the number of times final action is deferred by the Board, unless a simple
       majority of members of the Board of Commissioners vote to conduct such additional public hearings.
       Speakers will be called as they appear on the sign up form. Additional time may be allotted for either
       side at the Board's discretion and upon a simple majority of affirmative votes of the Board. Clerk's Note:
       State Law Mandates that the time be at least 10 minutes per side. (O.C.G.A. § 36-66-5)

4.     Once the Public Hearing has concluded, the Chairman shall so announce and call for a motion and a
       second to close the Public Hearing; after an affirmative vote by a majority of the Board, the Board may
       convene into regular session to make its decisions.

5.     As a general rule, members of the public do not speak on agenda items unless those items have been
       advertised for public hearing, or unless the Board, by a simple majority of affirmative votes, has decided
       that public participation is necessary in its deliberative process. The Board shall follow its Public
       Hearing rules when such participation is warranted.

6.     Public Hearings will be advertised in the newspaper of general circulation (County's Legal Organ), at
       least 15 days, but no more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing.

7.     The only exception to this will be public hearings pertaining to the budget or as otherwise
       governed by State Law. Any amendment to these rules of order by a Commission Member shall
       be submitted to the Clerk in writing one week before the designated meeting. The proposed
       amendment shall be included on the agenda for that meeting and distributed to all Board
       Members. All amendments require a simple majority of affirmative votes by the Board for adoption.

8.     Public Hearings are hereby required for Zoning Ordinance modifications; adoption of the annual
       budget; setting of the millage rate; and other matters as required by State law or at the request of the
       Cherokee County Board of Commissioners.

                                 POLICY NO. 03- P- 01

                                         PUBLIC COMMENT POLICY

In 1999, the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners established a public input policy, to welcome citizen
comment and attendance. The following is a revised edition of that policy. The original Policy No. 99-P-1 is
hereby rescinded.
                                                    (1)

The Cherokee County Board of Commissioners does hereby establish a policy that "Public Comment" is
invited and encouraged. However it must be made known that the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners
will not participate in a public debate regarding any item of public comment.

                                                         (2)

Therefore, it is the policy of Cherokee County that time for public comment will be set aside for each regularly
scheduled meeting. If the item you wish to speak about is on the agenda, it will be at the discretion of
the Board as to whether you will be allowed to speak.

                                                         (3)

At both regular meetings, a fifteen (15) minute period, after the approval of the minutes of the previous
meeting, will be set aside for public comment. Persons wishing to address the Board of Commissioners shall
be required to sign up at a designated area on a sign up sheet provided before the meeting, giving their name
and the topic of interest; the number of citizens appearing will be limited to five (5) on a first come first-served
basis and will be limited to three (3) minutes per presentation. Their comments must be limited to their chosen
topic. Only items pertaining to County business may be brought before the Board. The speaker is required to
state their name and location in the County and whether he/she is speaking for himself/herself or for another.

                                                         (4)

Any person or persons, organization or group wishing to be put on the agenda and address the Board of
Commissioners during a public appearance at which either official action will be considered or requested are
required to submit a written request to their Post Commissioner, and the County Clerk, explaining the nature of
the request, at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to said meeting.

                                                         (5)

Members of the public shall not make inappropriate, offensive, insulting or malicious remarks while addressing
the Commissioners during public comment. All remarks shall be made to the Commission as a body and
addressed through the Chair. Remarks shall not be made to a particular Commissioner.

                                                         (6)

A person may be barred from further speaking before the Commission in that meeting if his/her conduct is
deemed out of order; a person, once barred for improper conduct, shall not be permitted to continue or again
address the Commission in that meeting unless a majority vote of the Commission allows; in the event a
speaker thus barred fails to obey the ruling, the Chair may take such action as is deemed appropriate. The
Chairman may bar a person from addressing Commission meetings for up to thirty (30) days for improper
conduct

As revised this 6th day of May, 2003.

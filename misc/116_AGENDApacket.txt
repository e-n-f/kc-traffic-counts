PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
Bids were received by the Street/Traffic Division for the Public Works Department on December 11, 2012 to
purchase a 2013 4-Wheel Mechanical Broom High Dump Sweeper.  The replacement sweeper is in the approved

traded in to the company providing the new sweeper and an extended warranty will be purchased for the new
machine.

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
The City Council may: 
     Approve purchasing the 2013 4-Wheel Mechanical Broom High Dump Sweeper from Titan Machinery for
     $157,593, plus a 5-year warranty for $3,163; or
     Reject all bids and do not purchase the sweeper.

TITLE:           Bid Award - Fire Department Haz-Mat Trailer Tow Vehicle
PRESENTED BY: Paul Dextras
Department:      Fire

                                           Information
PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
The State HazMat Incident Response Teams (SHMIRT) consists of six (6) regional teams who
respond at the request of local or Tribal jurisdictions to incidents involving chemical, biological,
radiological, nuclear or explosive materials. These six (6) regional response teams work
together and separately to provide technician level responses.  A previous grant
purchased HazMat response trailers but did not allow purchasing a companion vehicle capable
of towing the fully-loaded response trailer. A tow vehicle dedicated to safely move Hazardous
Materials Technicians and their equipment to emergency incidents is called out in the plan.
Funding was secured last fiscal year to purchase four (4) vehicles for the Regional Teams in
Bozeman, Helena, Great Falls and Missoula.  The two (2) remaining units - one (1) for Kalispell
and one (1) for Billings may be purchased with a State Homeland Security Program (SHSP)
Grant.  A call for sealed bids was issued on 11/29/2012 and published in the  Billings Times on
11/29, 12/6, 12/13 and 12/20/2012. Notices were sent to fourteen (14) fire apparatus vendors on
11/28/2012. Bid opening occurred on 12/26/2012 at 2:00 p.m. Two bids were received. Big Sky
Fire Equipment, Lewistown, MT bid  $197,824.97  and Heiman, Inc., Lyon, SD bid $195,395.00.


ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
The City Council may approve or disapprove the vehicle purchase. 

FINANCIAL IMPACT
In July 2011, the Department of Military Affairs Disaster & Emergency Services Division
notified the Fire Chief that the State Regional HazMat Teams' application for the purchase of
tow vehicles was approved to be funded in the amount of $155,000.00. Both bids received are
over the amount earmarked for this project.  A request has been sent to the State DES Office
asking for guidance on how best to proceed. Because the funding for the purchase of the
remaining two HazMat tow vehicles was delayed, these funds are not budgeted in the HazMat
Grant Fund for FY2013.

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommendation will be made at the January 14, 2013 City Council meeting.

TITLE:           Bid Award: W.O. 12-47 WWTP Digester Gas Valve Replacement
PRESENTED BY: David Mumford
Department:      Public Works

                                          Information
PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
W.O. 12-47 WWTP Digester Gas Valve Replacement is a project to purchase new eccentric
plug valves to replace the old ones within the gas digester at the Wastewater Treatment Plant. 
The existing valves are over 50 years old and have reached their service life.  Many of them are
beginning to fail and are becoming increasingly difficult to open and close.  It is an approved
project in the current CIP.  The project was advertised November 8th through December 13th in
the  Billings Times and on the City's website.  Bids were opened on December 18, 2012 and one
bid was received.  Northwest Pipe Fittings submitted the lowest responsible bid.  The bid was
well below the engineer's estimate on this project.

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
The Council may: 
    Award W.O. 12-47 to Northwest Pipe Fittings in the amount of $53,932; or
    Not award the contract to Northwest Pipe Fittings and reject all bids.  If these valves are
    not purchased, the Wastewater Treatment Plant will not have valves to replace the old and
    failed valves within the gas digester.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The following bids were received and evaluated:

Fittings in the amount of $53,932.

TITLE:           Change Order #1: W.O. 12-47 WWTP Digester Gas Valve Replacement
PRESENTED BY: David Mumford
Department:      Public Works

                                           Information
PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
W.O. 12-47 WWTP Digester Gas Valve Replacement is a project to replace the valves at the
WWTP digesters due to age and wear of the existing valves.  After further research, it was
determined that the use of a valve coating applied to the inside of the valves can protect and
extend the life of the eccentric plug valves up to an additional 10 years.  The methane gas
produced by the digester is very corrosive and it was determined that this coating will protect the
inside bodies of the 61 valves from premature wearing and deterioration.

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
The Council may: 
    Approve Change Order No. 1 with Northwest Pipe Fittings in the amount of $7,227.32; or
    Do not approve Change Order No. 1. Disapproval of Change Order No. 1 means that the
    new valves can wear and deteriorate prematurely and there would be no extended service
    life of the valves.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this change order will be paid out of wastewater funds.  The original purchase
amount was $53,932.  The change order is $7,227.32.  The total contract amount after this
change order is $61,159.32. This change order reflects an increase to the contract of 13.4%. 

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that City Council approve Change Order No. 1 for W.O. 12-47 WWTP
Digester Gas Valve Replacement with Northwest Pipe Fittings in the amount of $7,227.32.

Order. The practice of accumulating Change Order items to reduce the administrative burden
may lead to unnecessary disputes.

For supplemental instructions and minor changes not involving a change in the Contract Price
or Contract Time, a Field Order may be used.

B. COMPLETING THE CHANGE ORDER FORM

Engineer initiates the form, including a description of the changes involved and attachments
based upon documents and proposals submitted by Contractor, or requests from Owner, or
both.

Once Engineer has completed and signed the form, all copies should be sent to Contractor for
approval. After approval by Contractor, all copies should be sent to Owner for approval.
Engineer should make distribution of executed copies after approval by Owner.

If a change only applies to price or to time, cross out the part of the tabulation that does not
apply.

TITLE:           Approval of a Five-Year Contract for Architectural Services with CTA
                 Architects and Engineers
PRESENTED BY: Tom Binford
Department:      Airport

                                           Information
PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
Historically, the Department of Aviation and Transit enters into a five-year term contract with a
registered professional architectural firm to provide the necessary architectural services for all
Federally funded Airport Improvement Program (AIP) projects, Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) projects, Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) projects, and the other general architectural
services needed to design and administer the construction work pertaining to the Department's
many buildings and their varied systems (heating, cooling, electrical, security, etc.).  The
five-year term allows the architect to become familiar with the numerous Federal Regulations
that must be followed when utilizing PFC funds or FTA and AIP grant funds,
which subsequently provides a greater continuity of service.  The five-year term is the maximum
allowed per Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular Number 150/5100-14D.

A Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to provide the Aviation and Transit Department with
architectural services for a five-year period was advertised in the  Billings Times for three weeks,
on the City's Web page, and distributed to three architectural firms and three plan rooms. 
Proposals were received from A&E Architects, JGA Architects, and CTA Architects and
Engineers.  A selection committee comprised of Airport Commission Members Sterling Starr and
Charlie Peterson and City of Billings staff members evaluated the RFQ responses. This
committee unanimously selected CTA Architects and Engineers.  

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
The City Council may: 
    Approve the award of the five-year Architectural Services Contract to CTA Architects and
    Engineers; or
    Decline to approve the award of the five-year Architectural Services Contract with CTA
    Architects and Engineers, and provide staff with guidance on how to proceed.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact at this time.  The architectural fees associated with each
future project will be negotiated between CTA and staff, and approved by the FAA or FTA. 
Subsequently, the base contract will be amended and approved by Council each time a project
is undertaken and the financial impact will be presented at that time. As in the past, the majority
of the costs will be funded with FTA or FAA AIP grants, or with PFC funds.

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that City Council approve the award of the Aviation and Transit Department's

TITLE:           Consultant Agreement: W.O. 12-45 3 MG Staples Reservoir Liner
PRESENTED BY: David Mumford
Department:      Public Works

                                          Information
PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
The Mayor and City Council are asked to consider authorizing and executing a Contract for
Professional Services with HDR Engineering, Inc. to provide engineering design for W.O. 12-45
3 MG Staples Reservoir Liner. The purpose of this project is to provide a liner in the Staples

life of the tank. HDR Engineering, Inc., was selected for this work based on City staff review of
project proposals submitted by pre-qualified firms. The negotiated price will not exceed $97,700. 

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
The Council may: 
    Approve the Contract for Professional Services with HDR Engineering, Inc.; or
    Do not approve the Contract for Professional Services with HDR Engineering, Inc.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project is from water revenues and is included in the FY13 budget.

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that City Council authorize the Mayor to sign a contract for professional
services with HDR Engineering, Inc., for W.O. 12-45 3 MG Staples Reservoir Liner in an amount
not to exceed $97,700.

TITLE:           Approval of Ten-Year Depository and Banking Services Contract with US
                 Bank
PRESENTED BY: Patrick M. Weber Finance Director
Department:      City Hall Administration

                                           Information
PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
The Finance Department recently prepared a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Depository and
Banking consultant services. The current contract with US Bank expires February 28, 2013. The
43 page RFP was advertised in the Billings Times on October 18 and October 25, 2012. Seven
banking institutions were also sent copies of the RFP via e-mail.

The selection committee consisted of Pat Weber, Liz Kampa-Weatherwax, Teri Walker and Gail
Rogeness. Proposals were received from Wells Fargo Bank, Commerce Bank and US Bank.
The committee evaluated the proposals and unanimously selected the proposal from US Bank.
The following response elements were considered: Proposal Compliance, Comprehensiveness
of Services Provided, Related Experience, Firm Stability, Prior City Experience, Assigned
Individuals, Account Analysis, and Charges for Services.

The State of Montana recently executed a 10-year banking contract due to all the technology
involved with banking services and the amount of time/effort and cost it would take to switch to
another vendor. The City of Helena's Council recently approved a resolution stating that a
banking RFP was not necessary if the City felt the service provided was adequate and the
pricing fair.

The City of Billings also evaluated all of the banking services and technology involved with those
services. Based on that evaluation, the contract with US Bank is recommended to be for a
10-year time frame beginning on March 1, 2013, and expiring on February 28, 2023.

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
Council may approve the contract or not approve the contract and provide guidance to the staff.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The banking service charges will be paid for by interest earned on a Certificate of Deposit in the
amount of $9 million. The interest rate will be at a minimum of .75% or Fed Funds Flat if it is
higher for the first five years of the contract. Fees and the method of payment for years six
through ten will be negotiated with US Bank.

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that the City Council approve, and the Mayor sign, the contract with US Bank.

TITLE:           Change Order #2, Empire Parking Garage
PRESENTED BY: Bruce McCandless, Asst City Administrator
Department:      City Hall Administration

                                           Information
PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
In October, the City Council approved an $11.5 million design/build contract with Sletten
Construction to build the Empire Parking Garage, located in the 2700 block of Montana Ave. 
Staff believes that Sletten should perform three tasks that are not in the original contract.  Two
were known to be part of the overall project: asbestos abatement in the Windsor Court building,
digging the trench and setting a duct bank for utility relocations in the east-west alley, and and
an unexpected need to line the sanitary and storm sewer lines in the alley. The City
Administrator approved Change Order #1, which added two of the items to the contract but
adding the third one exceeds the City Administrator's $500,000 change order approval authority
that is establised in City Code Section 13-502.  Change Order #2 covers the utility relocation
work and totals $330,000. This work is necessary prior to beginning the Northern Garage
demolition because live NWE conductors are too close to the structure, and all overhead utilities
would interfere with the planned sky bridge between the hotel and new garage.

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
There are no viable alternatives to the recommended action.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funds for the change order are included in the project budget.  However, the sewer rehab
work was not anticipated, and costs will have to be reduced in other parts of the project in order
to compensate for the extra expense.

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends the City Council approve the Empire Parking Garage Change Order #2 in the
amount of $330,000.

    Add dry utility trenching and sleeving relocation work in the alley north of the Empire Parking Garage.

CTA Architect and Engineers is currently working to complete design documents to detail the work to be performed.
Herein contained is the Design Builder's best understanding of the required work and associated costs. The scope
and costs detailed herein will require modification upon issuance of plans and specifications from CTA.

                ·The overall project description is to relocate above ground utilities to underground and adjust and or
        relocate existing underground utilities within the alley corridor between Montana Avenue and 1st Avenue
        North also lying between S. 27th Street extending east to approximately 100 feet east of S. 28th Street. The
        work will entail working with and coordinating the following utilities: Northwest Energy, Mid Rivers, Zayo,
        MDU, Century link, Integra, and Optimum. The City sewer and storm drainage systems also exist in the ally
        and may also be modified within work. Storm and Sewer Services will also be modified to serve the parking
        garage.

        ·        The Design Builder will meet with utilities, learn their criteria, requirements and coordinate with
        each utility whereby a common understanding and consensus is gained from each utility. With that
        consensus, common trench design to relocate utilities will be completed. Relocation may also result in
        modification to existing underground installations from some of the same utilities. Work will also entail
        street crossings and associated curb gutter and sidewalk replacement due to the utility relocations. The 28th
        Street crossing will include a temporary concrete surfacing that will be removed and replaced with asphalt
        when warmer weather permits. Trenching in the alley west of 28th Street will receive permanent concrete
        resurfacing after backfilling operations are completed.

        Exclusions include: Temporary resurfacing (Grading W base course) only in the alley between 27th and 28th
        Streets. Permanent resurfacing of the alley is not the responsibility of the Design Builder. An existing aged
        8" Rail Road sewer line that's location and current function is not known with any precision may be
        damaged during work activities. Repair of any damage is excluded. Permits and fees are not included.

        Compensation will be based upon documented costs and associated markup. An allowance of $330,000 has
        been included to complete the dry utility relocation work. Full payment and performance bonds are
        included.

        Allowance estimated cost breakdown:
              Yellowstone Electric (in trench work) -                         $164,191.66

TITLE:           Utility Relocation Agreement for the Empire Parking Garage Project
PRESENTED BY: Chris Mallow, Parking Supervisor
Department:      City Hall Administration

                                           Information
PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
The Empire parking garage will be constructed on the north side of Montana Avenue between
North 27th Street and North Broadway. The building consumes an entire half-block and the
north side of the building will be adjacent to an alley that runs east/west on that block. There are
several overhead and underground utilities that occupy the alley including power,
data/telecommunications, and gas. All overhead and some underground utilities need to be
relocated before any construction activity can begin on the Empire parking garage. The utility
companies have agreed to relocate the utilities to a designated underground alley location.
Relocating these utilities underground will allow the existing buildings to be torn down and the
new garage constructed while meeting OSHA requirements. It is necessary to pay the utility
companies because this relocation is due to a pending development and not their own initiative.
The utility companies include Montana Dakota Utilities, Northwestern Energy, Optimum, Integra,
Mid-Rivers Telecommunications, Zayo Group, and Century Link. It is necessary to enter into an
agreement with these utility companies in order for them to start the relocation. The
Northwestern and Optimum agreements were approved by City Council at the December 17,
2012, City Council meeting. The cost for the agreement with Zayo Group is expected to be
greater than $50,000, and requires City Council approval.

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
The Council may:
·Approve the agreement with Zayo Group; or
·Do not approve the agreement, which would require the overhead utilities to be temporarily
relocated during demolition or redesign the Empire parking garage so appropriate setbacks from
energized utiltiy lines are accounted for, leading to the possible elimination of the proposed sky
bridge between the Empire parking garage and the Northern Hotel.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The relocation price from Zayo Group for its fiber optic lines is $68,690.

The agreements with the other utilities will be signed by the City Administrator.

The funds for the utility relocation are budgeted into the cost for the Empire parking garage
budget and are estimated to total $800,000.

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that Council approve the agreement with Zayo Group to relocate the fiber
optic lines for the construction of the Empire parking garage.

TITLE:           Easement for Securities Building, LLC in the Empire Parking Garage 
PRESENTED BY: Bruce McCandless, Asst City Administrator
Department:      City Hall Administration

                                            Information
PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
One of the required tasks in the Empire Parking Garage project is to relocate the overhead
utilities in the east-west alley to an underground duct system.  Northwestern Electric needs to
install a new switch in a mid-block location.  They have secured an easement for the switch from
the Securities Building, LLC.  The easement's location displaces the Securities Building trash
receptacles.  The new parking garage has been designed to accommodate new receptacles
within the condominium unit that will be purchased by Alley Cat LLC.  Since the structure isn't
built, the unit can't be transfered to Alley Cat and the City owns the land.  In order to ensure that
the Securities Building will have a trash receptacle location when it allows Northwestern to use
its property for the new switch, the City is being asked to grant an easement for the receptacles
in the planned garage location.   

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
There are no viable alternatives.  A new power switch is needed for the Empire Parking Garage
project; Securities Building LLC owns the land where the switch should be placed and it
presently uses that space for its trash receptacles; Securities Building LLC will not grant an
easement for the new switch unless it has an alternative location for its trash in the planned
parking garage.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
This action does not have a direct financial impact on the City.

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that the City Council grant an easement to Securities Building LLC for its
trash receptacles in the planned Empire Parking Garage.

TITLE:           Donation from the Yellowstone County DUI Task Force in the Amount of
                 $1,495
PRESENTED BY: Rich St. John
Department:      Police

                                          Information
PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
The Yellowstone County DUI Task Force wishes to donate $1,495 to the Billings Police
Department to purchase five new AlcoBlow handheld breath alcohol testers to be used by
School Resource Officers.  With the current Preliminary Breath Testers (PBT's), the subject
must cooperate with the sampling in order to detect that s/he has consumed alcohol and also to
determine his/her Breath Alcohol Concentration.  The AlcoBlow can be used so an officer can
simply be talking to a subject and with a push of a button can detect the presence of alcohol in
the space between them. It can also be placed over a drink to determine if it contains
alcohol.  These instruments will be a great law enforcement tool, especially in zero tolerance
settings such as school sporting events, dances, etc. 

Council policy requires that any donation greater than $500 must be approved by the City
Council.  A donation verification form has been signed and will be forwarded to the City
Clerk.  City Council is being asked to accept the $1,495 donation from the Yellowstone County
DUI Task Force.

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
The City Council may: 
    Accept the $1,495 donation from the Yellowstone County DUI Task Force; or
    Not accept the $1,495 donation which will result in the Billings Police Department not
    purchasing the AlcoBlow handheld breath alcohol testers. 

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The donation from the Yellowstone County DUI Task Force will allow the Police Department to
purchase five new AlcoBlow handheld breath alcohol testers, thus improving efficiency and
reducing cost for the Department.

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that the City Council accept the $1,495 donation from the Yellowstone
County DUI Task Force to purchase the five new AlcoBlow handheld breath alcohol testers.

Department:      Parks/Rec/Public Lands

                                            Information
PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
The Parks, Recreation and Public Lands Department applied for and recieved a 2013 Urban and
Community Forestry Program Development Grant from the State of Montana, Department of
Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC).  The grant objectives are to improve the
management of Billings urban forest, execute a tree planting initative that will improve the urban
environment and educate the public on trees and their benefts to the community. 

The grant's objectives will be met by purchasing tree inventory computer software that will
provide for more efficient management and care of over 9,000 park trees and other public trees,
establishing a tree planting initiative called "Replant the South Side" with the goal of planting
100 trees in and around South Park with volunteer assistance from South Side residents and
organizations and by developing a public education program utilizing educational displays in city
parks about the value and benefits of trees.

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
1. Accept the 2013 Urban and Community Forestry Program Development Grant  from DNRC
and approve the Grant Agreement;
2. Decline the 2013 Urban and Community Forestry Program Development Grant  from DNRC.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2013 Urban and Community Forestry Program Development Grant amount from DNRC is
$12,780.00.  The grant requires a 50/50 match from the City of Billings.  The grant application
proposed matching the DNRC grant amount with $4,000.00 from the FY 13 Trash for Trees 
fund for tree purchases and $2,821.00 from the FY 13 Urban Forestry fund to purchase supplies
and materials for the project.  No additional funding or budget amendments are being
requested because both funds have sufficient funds available in the FY 13 budget to provide the
match.  Additionally, the grant application proposed matching the DNRC grant amount with
$11,180.00 of donated and in-kind services for project administration, seasonal labor, volunteer
labor and donated supplies and materials. 

Grant Amount -            $12,780.00

TITLE:           Zone Change #906 - Public Hearing and 1st reading - 3225 Rosebud Drive 
PRESENTED BY: Candi Beaudry
Department:      Planning & Community Services

                                             Information
PROBLEM/ISSUE STATEMENT
This is a zone change request from Planned Development ­ Residential Multi-family-Restricted
(PD-RMF-R) to Planned Development ­ Neighborhood Commercial (PD-NC). The existing
zoning also allows the location of a church as an allowed use in addition to the residential use. 
The application is for a 45,950 square foot parcel of land described as Lot 2, Block 28, Harvest
Subdivision, 3rd Filing located generally at 3225 Rosebud Drive. The property is a
unit-ownership parcel that includes 15 residential units and the now-vacant church/day care.
The vacant structure is owned by Stockman Bank. The residential owners are Terry Havener,
Susan Havener, Brittany Evans, Kimberly Erbacher, John Erbacher, Folmer Christensen, and
Mari Christensen. The agents are R.L. McComish and Sanderson Stewart representing the
potential purchasers of the Stockman Bank unit. The intent of the purchasers is to establish a
Pickle Barrel restaurant. The agents and owner conducted a pre-application neighborhood
meeting on September 24, 2012. A preliminary review meeting was held by city staff on October
29, 2012. The Zoning Commission granted the applicant a 30-day delay of the public hearing on
November 7, 2012. The applicant was preparing a detailed traffic study for the adjacent streets
and intersections. The Zoning Commission conducted a public hearing December 4, 2012, and
is forwarding a recommendation of approval on a 3-0-1 vote.

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED
State law at Section 76-2-304, MCA, requires that all zone changes be reviewed in accordance
with 10 criteria. Using the 10 criteria to determine the appropriateness of the zone change
request, the City Council may:

1. Approve the zone change request
2. Deny the zone change request
3. Allow withdrawal of the application
4. Delay action for up to thirty (30) days

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The City may realize additional tax revenue if the existing vacant building is renovated. The City
fees assigned to the property will be increased from the rate charged for residential to a rate
charged for commercial property.

BACKGROUND
The applicant is requesting to change the Planned Development zoning from residential
The applicant is requesting to change the Planned Development zoning from residential
multi-family with an allowance for a church to NC to allow the vacant church/daycare to be
re-used for a restaurant. The vacant building is owned by Stockman Bank after a default on the
loan by the previous owner, Don Hanser. The building has been vacant for over 3 years. The
property is a unit ownership but all parties have agreed to the zone change application. Zoning
districts generally follow platted lot lines so the underlying zoning applies to the entire lot, not
individual units in a unit ownership. The applicant intends to remodel the vacant building if the
zoning is approved.

Site development improvements will be necessary to meet off-street parking requirements and
accessibility standards. The new restaurant will have approximately 2,000 square feet of floor
area and an outdoor dining area on the east side of the building. Neighborhood Commercial
uses range from offices, to retail, to services such as banks, medical clinics and similar
businesses. It also includes uses such as gas stations, convenience food stores, and other uses
designed to provide services to larger residential neighborhoods as well as residential
multi-family dwellings. The current zoning allows the vacant building to be used as either a
church or a day care center. Any re-use of the building will require remodeling and updating.  

Each Planned Development zone may designate underlying zoning and may also adjust the
uses, setbacks, lot area requirements and building heights within those underlying zones. For
example, the underlying RMF-R zone for this lot requires only 1,900 square feet of lot area for
each dwelling unit. This could allow up to 23 dwelling units per acre of land in any type of
configuration (single, duplex or multi-family). The standard RMF-R zone requires 6,000 square
feet for each single dwelling unit, 7,000 square feet for each duplex and 8,500 square feet for
each 3-plex. For buildings with more than 3 units, an additional 1,500 square feet is required for
each added unit ­ e.g. a 4-plex requires 10,000 square feet. In the Harvest PD Agreement,
Block 28 (includes Lots 1 and 2) up to 102 dwelling units are allowed. The Timbers Townhomes
to the west has 68 dwelling units and the Rose has 15 dwelling units for a total of 83 dwelling
units on this block. 

In 2002, the City Council approved the re-use of the church building for a day care center. The
day care center operated until early 2009. In 2006, the average daily traffic on 32nd Street West
between Henesta and Rosebud Drive was 9,852 vehicle trips per day. This traffic count was
conducted just prior to the completion of 32nd Street West as a full arterial street from Rimrock
Road to Hesper Road. The completion of 32nd Street West north of Broadwater increased the
average daily traffic from 9,852 vehicle trips per day in 2006 to 16,671 vehicle trips per day in
2012, a 69% increase in average daily traffic in a 6-year period. The impact of increased traffic
has resulted in a much lower level of service at the intersections of Henesta and Rosebud with
32nd Street West. Traffic turning left on to King Ave West from southbound traffic on 32nd
Street West is typically stacked to the intersection with Henesta Drive. During peak hours, traffic
waiting to turn left on King Avenue West will stack in the center turn lane up to the intersection
of Rosebud Drive and 32nd Street West, a distance of 500 feet north of the signal.

The afternoon hours are the peak hours for traffic and the average is 1,200 vehicles per hour
between noon and 5 pm. The waiting time for traffic to enter South 32nd Street West from any of
the stop-sign controlled intersections or driveways in this area is increased during these peak
hours. The applicant conducted a traffic analysis of the intersection of Rosebud Drive and South
32nd Street West. The traffic analysis indicates the intersection operates at a Level of Service
(LOS) of "F" during the peak traffic hours at noon and 5 pm. An LOS rating of "F" indicates there
are long wait times at this intersection during peak hours. A LOS of "F" typically means the
traffic control and the capacity of the intersection has failed. The traffic analysis report is
included as an attachment.

The Pickle Barrel will add traffic to Rosebud Drive and 32nd Street West. The estimated traffic
increase is 130 trips per 1,000 square feet of restaurant area but could be as high as 700 trips
per 1,000 square feet. The applicant estimates the floor area for the restaurant will be 2,000
square feet resulting in an additional 260 to 1,400 vehicle trips per day, mostly during peak
hours for traffic on 32nd Street West. The former day care center generated about 80 trips per
1,000 square feet of floor area or about 280 trips per day at maximum floor area of 3,500 square
feet. By comparison, the Holiday gas station, convenience store and car wash generates on
average 1,240 vehicle trips per day. The actual traffic at the Holiday gas station may be higher
since it typically sells the lowest priced gas in the city, attracting traffic from out of the area.
Each multi-family residential unit in the area contributes on average 8 vehicle trips per day. The
three unit ownership developments in the immediate neighborhood west of 32nd Street West
generate 920 vehicle trips per day. Big Sky Elementary generates about 1,305 vehicle trips per
day. The traffic analysis submitted by the applicant estimates the additional traffic from the
Pickle Barrel restaurant will generate 75 additional trips during the noon peak hour and 21
additional trips during the evening peak hour.

The applicant conducted a pre-application neighborhood meeting on September 24, 2012, and
several surrounding property owners attended the meeting. A synopsis of the meeting was
provided and is included as an attachment. The notes state approximately 9 surrounding owners
attended and voiced concerns with off-street parking for the restaurant and with existing traffic
congestion on 32nd Street West. The notes state the agent received 4 phone calls from owners
who could not attend the pre-application meeting. Three were supportive and 1 was opposed to
the zone change.

City staff conducted a preliminary meeting on October 29, 2012 with staff, surrounding owners
and the applicant. Two surrounding owners attended the meeting as well as City Traffic
Engineer Terry Smith and Wayne Ware, Senior Engineering Technician. The discussion of the
proposal concerned traffic and off-street parking. The applicant and agent indicated a traffic
analysis of the Rosebud Drive intersection with 32nd Street West was in preparation but not yet
completed. The impact of new traffic from the restaurant could not be evaluated at this time
without the completion of the study. Information from surrounding owners indicated that traffic
stacking in the north bound lane of 32nd Street from the signalized intersection with Monad
Road also occurs most afternoons. The owners stated the traffic will stack south to the
intersection with Granger Avenue East.

The agent stated solutions to existing traffic congestion on 32nd Street West could include
adding a left turn lane at King Avenue West, a signal at Rosebud Drive, a round-a-bout at King
Avenue West or Rosebud Drive, re-arranging the internal circulation of the parking lot or adding
a new drive approach from the property out to 32nd Street West. City staff indicated they would
not support a new signal at Rosebud or a new drive approach on to 32nd Street West. Staff
pointed out any new parking space in the arterial setback (50 feet from the center of 32nd Street
West) could not be counted toward the minimum required for the residences and the new
restaurant. The agent indicated the existing parking lot has more than the minimum required so
any additional spaces would be above the requirement. Planning staff asked the agent to study
where the solid waste collection and storage would be located for the restaurant. This location
may cause the loss of 1 or more parking spaces.

Staff indicated a concern the proposed location may not be the most appropriate for a new
Staff indicated a concern the proposed location may not be the most appropriate for a new
restaurant given the traffic congestion and proximity to a densely developed neighborhood. The
applicant stated the location would be good for the neighborhoods to provide a walkable
location to a restaurant for everyone. The applicant stated the proposed zoning and the
restaurant is supported by the growth policy because it is on an arterial street near the
intersection of two arterial streets. One of the surrounding owners indicated the neighborhood is
not very walkable since there are no sidewalks except for right around the school on Granger
Avenue East.

The Planning staff received several petitions and letters from surrounding owners opposed to
the zone change. Planning staff received two letters of support. These are all included in an
attachment.


STAKEHOLDERS
The Zoning Commission conducted a public hearing on December 4, 2012 and received the
staff report, recommendation, and testimony from the applicant and agents for the zone
change. The Zoning Commission also received testimony from 2 property owners in opposition
to the zone change. 

Planning staff presented the report and recommendation. Zoning Coordinator, Nicole Cromwell,
stated the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) was reviewed with the applicant's agent, Transportation
Planner Scott Walker, and City Traffic Engineer Terry Smith on December 3, 2012. She stated
the analysis was accurate according to all parties but the Planning and Engineering staff could
not support the zone change to NC. The staff is concerned with the existing traffic LOS "F" and
the long wait times for traffic particularly at the evening peak hour. Staff stated the wait times
predicted at the Rosebud Drive intersection approach 13 minutes. Staff believes actual wait
times may be lower due to the volume of traffic using the parking lane to make right turns on to
South 32nd Street West. Discounting some of the traffic volume for right turns would reduce the
wait time at the intersection to 6 or 7 minutes. This wait time still puts the intersection at a LOS
of "F". Staff stated the City has no current or proposed traffic mitigation project for this arterial
corridor.

Rick Leuthold of Sanderson Stewart presented testimony in favor of the application. Mr.
Leuthold stated the traffic analysis indicated an existing problem but he pointed out any re-use
of the vacant building would impact this intersection. He stated a re-use by a day care center,
an allowed use, may have a greater traffic impact than the proposed Pickle Barrel
restaurant.  Mr. Leuthold said the project has been interesting. He stated he has been involved
with the site since the church was there and when the property was purchased and housing
development started. The subject property was a daycare for some years and since then
Stockman Bank has owned the site and has been looking for a new tenant/buyer. He stated the
bank only received inquiries from day care providers but did not move forward. He stated
the Pickle Barrel was looking for new site after the 13th Street West site closed. He stated the
owner rated this location as its top site.

He stated any solution to the traffic situation at Rosebud Drive will involve a much larger area
including the traffic signals at King Avenue West and Monad Road at the least. Mr. Leuthold
stated the City has been aware of the 32nd Street signal timing issues but does not have a
project in the Capital Improvement Program (CIP) to rectify the problem. He stated two
alternatives for the Rosebud Drive intersection were proposed in the traffic study, but neither are
acceptable to the City. He stated allowed uses on the property would also add as much or more
traffic than the proposed use for a restaurant.

City Traffic Engineer Terry Smith, provided clarification on his recommendation to deny the zone
change. He stated the City is concerned about protecting the 32nd Street West corridor from
strip commercial zoning and from adding traffic control signals that are not adequately spaced.
He stated traffic issues on other major arterial corridors such as Grand Avenue and 24th Street
West are the combined effect of strip zoning and installing traffic signals closer than necessary.
He stated the existing problem should be addressed before additional commercial uses are
added to the corridor. He stated the accident rate at Rosebud is not increasing and the City
recently allowed additional access on to King Avenue West to relieve some of the traffic
conflicts at Henesta and 32nd Street West.

Richard McComish, the agent for the Pickle Barrel restaurant, testified in favor of the application.
He stated he owns ECI which employs about 135 people in Billings. He stated he is a
community-oriented businessman who is in favor of providing good jobs and services in the
community. He stated community is important to his business and his family. Mr. McComish
stated when he met with the staff on this, he heard about the traffic problem. He stated 32nd
Street West is a major corridor. He asked Sanderson Stewart to conduct the traffic analysis,
although this is not required. He stated as an engineer by training, it was important to have
accurate data before concluding there is a problem or working on solutions. There are other
commercially-zoned lots to be developed in the area. He stated he does not pursue a
development on a lark and is always prepared to do things right and move forward. He stated
the restaurant franchise chose the site and he has been diligently pursuing the zone change. He
stated he is concerned that the basis for denial is traffic, but allowed uses can generate a lot of
traffic now. He stated the City's master plan and policies support nodal development in this area
and the proposed zone change and restaurant will contribute to achieving the goals of the
master plan.

George Warmer of 2608 Highwood Drive, and a principal in Coldwell Banker Commercial,
stated the property has been listed for sale for more than 2 years. It has stayed on the market
because of the limited uses for the property. He stated the Pickle Barrel project came to with
a plan and investment in the process. He said he sees this (use) as an attractive solution to this
location. He stated the Pickle Barrel will be similar to other neighborhood services such as Great
Harvest on Poly or Harper-Madison on 10th Avenue North. Mr. Warmer presented a letter from
Dale Davis of Myrtle Drive. Mr. Warmer stated Mr. Davis could not attend the hearing but
wanted his support of the project on the record. 

Tim Ludewig of Stockman Bank, representing the unit owner testifed in favor of the application.
He stated that allowed uses or the sandwich shop are the best uses for this location. Any of the
uses will impact traffic. He stated considering length of time the City may need to address traffic,
a reasonable plan is to put the building back into use knowing what we know right now.

Gayle Ziech of 625 Chokecherry Place testified in opposition to the zone change. She stated the
City has effectively condemned her property by completing the 32nd Street West connection to
Zimmerman Trail. She stated a restaurant will add even more traffic and traffic noise to her back
yard. She stated she can no longer use her back yard at all. She stated the traffic is so loud you
cannot carry on a normal conversation outside her back door. She stated she has a letter from
the Montana Department of Transportation stating the City has condemned her property by not
installing a proper sound barrier along 32nd Street West. Chairman Dailey asked Ms. Ziech if
she had a copy of this letter to provide to the City. She stated she did not have a copy with her
at the hearing.
Brittany Evans, a unit owner in Rosebud Condominiums, testified in opposition. She stated she
did sign the zone change application to allow the Pickle Barrel to try and re-zone the property
however, in the last few weeks, she has changed her mind based on research she has done.
She stated her primary concern was the increase in the fees she will have to pay the City for
arterial streets and storm sewer. She stated she is very concerned with the loss of market value
of her condominium unit if a busy restaurant is located across the driveway.

Mr. Leuthold provided rebuttal of the testimony in opposition. Mr. Leuthold stated the
condominium documents will need to be revised to accommodate the new restaurant. He stated
the restaurant owner is willing to pick up all the additional fees, and take over maintenance of
the parking lot and driveways. He stated the restaurant will work with all the unit owners to
buffer the use from the residential units, including elevation treatments on the building, lighting,
noise and other issues between the unit owners. He stated again that any re-use of the building
will bring added traffic to 32nd Street West. The potential traffic impact for this use would be no
greater and in some cases less than any allowed use. He stated the traffic issue should not be
the sole issue to prevent a zone change.

The public hearing was closed. Commission member Mike Boyett made a motion to recommend
approval of the zone change and the motion was seconded by member Bill Ryan. Mr. Ryan
stated the traffic problem already exists and the proposed zone change and re-use of the
building will not have any greater traffic impact than the existing allowed uses. He stated the
City should work on the traffic issues separately. Mr. Boyett stated he does not believe
penalizing this owner for an existing traffic problem is appropriate. Chairman Dailey stated the
City should take the initiative to study and upgrade the signal timing in this corridor so the traffic
burden on Rosebud and Henesta can be relieved. The Commission voted 3 in favor, none
opposed, and 1 abstaining on the motion to recommend approval. Member Barbara Hawkins
abstained due to a conflict of interest as she and her husband own adjoining property.
 

CONSISTENCY WITH ADOPTED POLICIES OR PLANS
The Planning Division reviewed the application and the traffic analysis, and recommended
denial of the proposed change to the Planned Development agreement. The recommendation is
based on the attached ten (10) criteria for zone changes. The City Traffic Engineer, H. Terry
Smith, also reviewed the traffic analysis and recommended denial to the Zoning Commission.
Mr. Smith's memo is included as an attachment. The subject property is adjacent to dense
residential development to the north and west, and across the street from PD-NC zoning for the
Holiday gas station. Zoning across 32nd Street West is lower density residential and some of
this property remains undeveloped. The 2008 Growth Policy encourages predictable land use
decisions that are consistent with neighborhood character and land use patterns. The original
zoning for the property is appropriate. The proposed zoning would extend commercial zoning
along an arterial street that is already strained by traffic congestion. While some pedestrian
access of the location can be expected, the majority will be additional vehicle traffic turning into
and out of Rosebud Drive. The peak time period for restaurant service is also the peak time
period for traffic on 32nd Street West. 

The Zoning Commission did not concur with the staff recommendation and analysis of the ten
The Zoning Commission did not concur with the staff recommendation and analysis of the ten
(10) criteria for zone changes. The Zoning Commission determined the impact to the
existing traffic problem at Rosebud Drive and 32nd Street West would be no greater than one of
the allowed uses under the existing zoning. The Zoning Commission believes this owner should
not be held accountable for an existing problem the City needs to address, regardless of the
zoning on this property or the use of the vacant building. The Zoning Commission determined
the general welfare of the neighborhood would benefit from the re-use of a vacant and decaying
building, and the benefit would be greater than any potential detriment to the traffic situation on
Rosebud Drive. The Zoning Commission is forwarding a recommendation of approval on a 3-0-1
vote.

Prior to any making a decision on the proposed zone change, the City Council shall consider the
following 10 criteria:

1. Is the new zoning designed in accordance with the Growth Policy?
The proposed zone change is consistent with the following goals of the Growth Policy:
· Predictable land use decisions that are consistent with neighborhood character and land use
patterns. (Land Use Element Goal, page 6) 
The proposed zoning would permit the proposed restaurant to be located directly adjacent to the
existing multi-family dwellings on the site. The surrounding neighborhood character is primarily
higher density residential uses to the north and west and lower density residential uses to the
east. The proposed zoning would allow the vacant building to be re-used as a neighborhood
service business such as the proposed restaurant. This is consistent with the character and
pattern of this area. 
· New developments that are sensitive to and compatible with the character of adjacent City
neighborhoods. (Land Use Goal, page 6)
The proposed Planned Development zone change to NC could allow additional commercial
uses north of Rosebud Drive. The proposed zoning is compatible with the adjacent
neighborhood. While the proposed use will add traffic to the intersection with Rosebud Drive and
32nd Street West, so would all the current allowed uses for a church, a day care center, or
multi-family dwellings. The proposed zoning is sensitive to and compatible with the character of
the neighborhood.  

2. Is the new zoning designed to secure from fire and other dangers?
The new zoning requires minimum setbacks, open and landscaped areas and building
separations. The new zoning, as do all zoning districts, provides adequate building separations
and density limits to provide security from fire and other dangers.

3. Whether the new zoning will promote public health, public safety, and general welfare?
Public health, safety, and general welfare will not be compromised by the proposed zoning. The
existing traffic congestion on Rosebud and 32nd Street West would be impacted by any re-use
of the vacant building, regardless of the underlying zoning district. Re-use of the vacant and
decaying building will benefit the general welfare of the neighborhood. 

4. Will the new zoning facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water,
sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirement?
Transportation: The re-use of the vacant building will have an impact on the surrounding streets.
The proposed re-use under the NC zoning will have no greater impact than potential uses
allowed by the current zoning. A traffic impact study was conducted, and although the City
Traffic Engineer recommended denial of the zone change, resolving the existing problem at the
intersection should not be shouldered by one owner.
Water and Sewer: The City provides water and sewer to the property.  
Schools and Parks: There should not be any impact to schools or parks from the proposed zone
change.
Fire and Police: The subject property is currently served by the City Public Safety Services.

5. Will the new zoning provide adequate light and air?
The proposed zoning provides for sufficient setbacks to allow for adequate separation between
structures and adequate light and air.

6. Will the new zoning effect motorized and non-motorized transportation?
Traffic generation from a commercial site is dependent on the specific uses within the
development. The site is currently developed with 15 dwelling units and has one vacant
church/daycare. Re-use of the existing structure for a daycare or church will generate traffic.
These uses are allowed by the current zoning. The proposed zoning of PD-NC will allow
commercial re-use of the vacant structure or demolition and construction of a new commercial
building. The proposed use, a restaurant, will generate an additional 75 trips through the
intersection during the noon peak hour and 21 trips at the evening peak hour. The proposed use
and zoning should place no greater burden at the intersection than any of the allowed
uses. Residents in the area report avoiding the intersection of Rosebud Drive and 32nd Street
West during peak hours (noon to 5 pm on weekdays) and having to perform "stunt" driving at
other times to turn left (to head north) out of Rosebud Drive. Despite the traffic congestions, the
accidents reported at this intersection are no greater than similar intersections in Billings (7 over
a period of 3 years). 

7. Will the new zoning promote compatible urban growth?
The new zoning does promote compatibility with urban growth. The existing vacant structure
can be re-used for a church or a day care. The existing building can be demolished and new
multi-family dwelling units constructed. The proposed zoning would allow the re-use of the
building for a neighborhood service provider such as the proposed restaurant. The existing and
proposed zoning is compatible with urban growth. 

8. Does the new zoning consider the character of the district and the peculiar suitability
of the property for particular uses?
The proposed zoning does consider the character of the district and the suitability of the property
for commercial uses. The property is suitable for commercial uses such as the proposed
restaurant. 

9. Will the new zoning conserve the value of buildings?
The new zoning does conserve the value of the vacant structure. The re-use of the building for a
restaurant will require significant rehabilitation. Surrounding building values may increase if the
structure is occupied. The market value effect on the adjacent residential units within the
unit-owned property is not predictable.

10. Will the new zoning encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the City
of Billings?
The proposed zoning does encourage the most appropriate use of the land. Appropriate uses
may include the existing zoned uses as well as uses allowed in the PD-NC zone such as the
proposed restaurant.

Re: Pickle Barrel Proposed Site
City of Billings,
   This letter is to express my approval for the zone change to allow the Pickle Barrel Sandwich
shop to be allowed to have their business on Rosebud and 32nd Street West.
   My business, Fiberworks is located in close proximity to the proposed location. I encourage
and support small business, and I think that a sandwich shop would be great for this location.
We are a "neighborhood" commercial area and I think this business would fit well with the other
businesses in the area. If you have any questions or would like to contact me, please feel free to
do so.

Sincerely,
Laura Heine

INTRODUCTION


This traffic impact study summarizes the potential impacts of the proposed development of a Pickle
Barrel Restaurant in Billings, Montana. The proposed project is located on the northwest corner of
the intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud Drive on the west end of Billings.


The purpose of this traffic impact study (TIS) is to assess the impacts that this development may
have on the surrounding transportation system, and to provide recommendations to mitigate any
impacts identified. The methodology and analysis procedures used in this study employ the latest
technology and nationally accepted standards in the area of site development and transportation
impact assessment. Recommendations made in this report are based on professional judgment and
these principles.


SITE LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION


The proposed project would consist of redevelopment of the existing day care building located on
the northwest corner of 32nd Street West and Rosebud Drive. The project site is located on Lot 2,
Block 28 of Harvest Subdivision, 3rd Filing, which is shared with several existing residential
condominiums. The site is bordered by 32nd Street West to the east, Rosebud Drive to the south
and existing residential development to the north and west. Figure 1 shows the vicinity of the
proposed development.


The site currently consists of a 2000 square-foot day care building and 15 residential condominium
units. The condo units are occupied, but the day care is currently vacant. Pending a zone change
application, the vacant day care building will be remodeled for the Pickle Barrel Restaurant. The
new restaurant will have approximately 2000 square feet of interior space and an outdoor patio
estimated at approximately 500 square feet. The site is accessed by an existing driveway along
Rosebud Drive, as well as a direct access to 32nd Street West on the north side of the restaurant.
Because of the location of the customer parking and the building entrance on the south side of the
building, it is likely that most of the customer traffic would enter via the Rosebud access. When the
Rosebud intersection is congested, it is possible that some drivers will use the 32nd Street access
instead, particularly to exit the site. Figure 2 shows the proposed site layout.

EXISTING CONDITIONS


Streets
The proposed redevelopment of the Pickle Barrel site may have a direct impact on the adjacent
streets and intersections. The following paragraphs describe the existing area roadways that are
most likely to be affected by the traffic volumes generated by this development.


32nd Street West
Classified as a principal arterial in the City of Billings functional classification system, 32nd Street
West provides north-south access from Hesper Road at the south end to Broadwater Avenue where
it becomes Zimmerman Trail and continues to the north side of the Rimrocks where it intersects US
Highway 3 west of the airport. Near the project vicinity, 32nd Street West has a three-lane cross
section with a two-way left-turn lane and traffic signals at major intersections. Traffic count data
recently collected by the City of Billings shows Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes of
16,600 vehicles per day (vpd) in August 2012 and 15,500 vpd in November 2012. The posted speed
limit on 32nd Street West is 35 mph.


Rosebud Drive
Rosebud Drive is classified as a local street in the Billings functional classification system. It
provides access to primarily residential properties located on both the west and east sides of 32nd
Street West. Rosebud Drive is a two-lane roadway with stop control at 32nd Street West and
uncontrolled intersections within the neighborhoods on either side. There is not a posted speed
limit on 32nd Street West, but it is generally considered to be 25 mph, as with all local residential
streets.


King Avenue West
King Avenue West is classified as a principal arterial in the Billings functional classification system.
It provides east-west access between the West Billings Interstate 90 Interchange and its terminus
near 80th Street West on the far west end of the Billings area. Within the vicinity of 32nd Street
West, King Avenue West consists of a five-lane section with raised median and provides access to a
mix of commercial and residential development. Traffic volumes on King Avenue West range from
approximately 10,000 vpd near 32nd Street West to 25,000 vpd near 24th Street West where the

                                                                      PICKLE BARREL RESTAURANT TIS


commercial traffic increases significantly. King Avenue West has a posted speed limit of 35 mph
near the project vicinity.


Monad Road
Monad Road is classified as a minor arterial in the Billings functional classification system. It
provides east-west access from Shiloh Road on the west end to Moore Lane near its intersection
with Laurel Road on the east end. It generally consists of a single lane in each direction with
dedicated turn lanes at major intersections. Monad Road has a posted speed limit of 35 mph.


Intersections
The following paragraphs describe the existing area intersections that are most likely to be impacted
by the redevelopment of the proposed Pickle Barrel site.

32nd Street West & Rosebud Drive
The intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud Drive is a two-way stop-controlled intersection
with stop signs located on the eastbound and westbound Rosebud Drive approaches.                The
northbound and southbound approaches consist of dedicated left-turn lanes provided by the newly
striped two-way left-turn lane. The eastbound and westbound approaches provide a single lane for
all movements, although adequate width is available for a right-turning vehicle to get around another
vehicle waiting to turn left.


32nd Street West & King Avenue West
The intersection of 32nd Street West and King Avenue West is controlled by an existing fully-
actuated traffic signal. The northbound and southbound approaches consist of three separate
approach lanes to accommodate left-turn, thru, and right-turn movements.            The westbound
approach consists of a dedicated left-turn lane, two thru lanes, and a dedicated right-turn lane. The
eastbound approach consists of a dedicated left-turn lane, one thru lane and one shared thru/right-
turn lane. The existing traffic signal provides for protected/permitted left-turn phasing for all
approaches with an overall peak-hour cycle length of approximately 100 seconds.




SANDERSON STEWART                                                                                  5
                                                                      PICKLE BARREL RESTAURANT TIS


32nd Street West & Monad Road
The intersection of 32nd Street West and Monad Road is also controlled by a fully-actuated traffic
signal. The northbound, southbound, and eastbound approaches all consist of a dedicated left-turn
lane and a shared thru/right-turn lane. The westbound approach has three separate lanes for left-
turn, thru and right-turn movements. The existing traffic signal provides for protected/permitted
left-turn phasing for the northbound and southbound approaches, but does not provide a protected
phase for eastbound or westbound left-turn movements.        The overall peak-hour cycle length was
measured to be approximately 80 seconds.


Traffic Volumes
Existing weekday noon and PM peak hour turning movement counts were collected for the study
area intersections in November 2012. The noon peak hour was assumed to be from 12:00 to 1:00
PM and the PM peak hour was assumed to be from 4:30 to 5:30 PM. MDT seasonal adjustment
factors for the month of November were applied to the existing traffic volumes.             Figure 3
summarizes the peak hour turning movement volumes, and detailed traffic count data are included
in Appendix A.


Intersection Capacity
Capacity calculations were performed for the study area intersections using Synchro 8 (Version
8.0.802.685), which is based on 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM2010) methodologies. The
HCM2010 defines level of service (LOS) as "a quality measure describing operational conditions
within a traffic stream, generally in terms of such service measures as speed and travel time, freedom
to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort and convenience." LOS is a qualitative measure of the
performance of an intersection with values ranging from LOS A, indicating good operation and low
vehicle delays, to LOS F, which indicates congestion and longer vehicle delays.


The City of Billings generally considers LOS C as the minimum standard for acceptable peak hour
intersection operations. As shown by the results in Table 1, most of the study area intersection
approaches currently operate at LOS C or better during both the noon and PM peak hours. The
one exception is the eastbound approach to the intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud
Drive, which currently operates at LOS F during both peak periods. Detailed capacity calculation
worksheets for existing conditions are provided in Appendix B.

TRIP GENERATION


An accurate estimate of site-generated traffic must be made in order to analyze the impacts of a new
development. The most common source for determining trip generation rates is Trip Generation, 8th
Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The land use categories
available in this manual that would be the closest to the characteristics of a Pickle Barrel Restaurant
would be the Fast-Food Restaurant with Drive-through Window (ITE Land Use 934) and the High-
turnover (Sit-down) Restaurant (ITE Land Use 932). Through discussions with the City of Billings
Engineering Department it was agreed that neither of these categories fully represent a sandwich
shop like the Pickle Barrel, which does not have a drive-through window and where customers order
at the counter and then sit down or take the food to go. It was anticipated that the trip generation
characteristics of this type of restaurant would fall somewhere between the trip generation rates of a
fast-food restaurant and a high-turnover sit-down restaurant.

SANDERSON STEWART                                                                                    8
                                                                            PICKLE BARREL RESTAURANT TIS




Therefore, trip generation data was collected at two local restaurants that are similar in nature to the
Pickle Barrel. The selection of restaurants was approved ahead of time by the City of Billings
Engineering Department and included the Pita Pit Restaurant on Grand Avenue (west of 24th Street
West) and the Spicy Pickle Restaurant on 24th Street West (south of King Avenue West). As shown
by the results provided in Appendix C, trip generation data was collected during both of the peak
periods used for this study, the weekday noon peak hour and the weekday PM peak hour. Data was
also collected during the Saturday noon peak hour at the Pita Pit and has been provided for
comparison purposes even though this peak hour was not considered for further analysis.


The resulting noon and PM peak hour trip generation rates were then used to estimate the number
of trips that will be generated by the proposed Pickle Barrel Restaurant, as shown in Table 2 below.
In order to be conservative, the maximum peak hour trip generation rate of the two restaurants
discussed above was used to estimate the peak hour trip generation for the Pickle Barrel, as opposed
to using the average of the two. The Spicy Pickle data was higher for the weekday noon peak hour,
but the Pita Pit was higher for the weekday PM peak hour. The average weekday rate shown in
Table 2 was based on the proportion of average weekday and PM peak hour trip generation
estimates in the ITE Trip Generation manual.

In order to estimate the net number of new trips made by personal vehicles external to the site,
adjustments should often be made to account for internal capture trips, pass-by trips and trips made

SANDERSON STEWART                                                                                            9

by alternate modes. Internal capture trips are those that are made from one on-site development to
another using internal roadways. Mixed-use developments often have a high number of internal
trips made between the various land uses. For this site in particular, it is possible that internal trips
would be generated between the residential condos and the Pickle Barrel Restaurant, but these trips
are not expected to make up a significant portion of the average weekday trips and were therefore
not accounted for in this analysis.


Pass-by trips are trips made to a development as a secondary destination, but the primary trip path is
on the adjacent street system. Commercial developments often generate a significant amount of
pass-by trips. As shown in Table 2, pass-by rates were estimated for the restaurant based on data
summarized in the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition. The pass-by rate used for the Pickle
Barrel restaurant was the lower (and more conservative) of the rates provided for fast-food
restaurant with drive-through window and high-turnover sit-down restaurant.


Typically, it is also important to estimate the number of new trips that would be made by alternate
modes of travel (pedestrian, bicycle and transit). These trips would not involve new external
personal vehicles accessing the site.     The Pickle Barrel site will likely generate quite a bit of
pedestrian and bicycle traffic from nearby residential neighborhoods, but it is not anticipated that it
would have a significant effect on the results of this analysis. In order to add a measure of
conservatism to the study, no reductions were made for alternate mode trips.


Table 2 provides a breakdown of each of these trip types. Results of this analysis show that the
redevelopment of the proposed Pickle Barrel site would generate approximately 310 new personal
vehicle trips during the average weekday (combination of new external trips and pass-by trips).
Approximately 75 (37 entering and 38 exiting) of those trips would be generated during the noon
peak hour and 21 (11 entering and 10 exiting) would be generated during the PM peak hour.


Comparison to Other Land Use Scenarios
As noted previously, it was anticipated that the trip generation rates for the Pickle Barrel Restaurant
should fall somewhere in the middle of what would have been estimated using either of the
restaurant land uses available in the ITE Trip Generation manual (fast-food restaurant with drive-
through window or high-turnover sit-down restaurant). Therefore, it is relevant to compare the

SANDERSON STEWART                                                                                     10
                                                                         PICKLE BARREL RESTAURANT TIS


results of the trip generation data collection effort to determine if that was indeed the case. The ITE
Trip Generation manual does not include data specifically for the noon peak hour, but a general
comparison can be made for the PM peak hour data. The PM peak hour rate estimated for the
Pickle Barrel Restaurant in Table 2 is on the same order of magnitude as the PM peak hour average
rate for a high-turnover sit-down restaurant in the ITE manual (8.46 vs. 11.15). Interestingly, the
noon peak hour rate shown in Table 2 is very close to the PM peak hour rate for fast-food
restaurant with drive-through window in the ITE manual (30.00 vs. 33.84). What this tells us is that
the trip generation data collection effort completed for this analysis produced reasonable results
compared to the ITE data. However, had we used the ITE data, we would not have been able to
adequately estimate trips generated during the noon peak hour, which clearly represents the worst-
case scenario for a sandwich shop located on Billings' West End.


It is also relevant to compare the trip generation estimates for the Pickle Barrel Restaurant to the
original day care center land use. This site was previously approved for a 2000 square-foot day care
center for up to 72 children under the current zoning designation. The ITE Trip Generation
manual shows that a Day Care Center (ITE Land Use 565) could be estimated to generate 12.46
trips per 1000 square feet of gross floor area or 0.82 trips per student in the PM peak hour. Based
on gross floor area, the Pickle Barrel Restaurant will generate very close to the same number of trips
during the PM peak hour (25 trips for the day care vs. 21 trips for the Pickle Barrel). If trip
generation for the day care were estimated using the rate based on number of students, we would
see a significantly higher number of trips for the day care center (59 trips for the day care vs. 21 trips
for the Pickle Barrel). Either way, this analysis shows that the Pickle Barrel Restaurant should
generate the same or fewer trips than the previous land use of day care center.


TRIP DISTRIBUTION


Trip distribution is an estimate of site-generated trip origin and destination locations, which can be
determined by several methods from computerized travel demand models to simple inspection of
existing traffic volumes. For this study, the trip distribution was primarily based on the distribution
of existing traffic volumes at the study area intersections and existing driveways, as well as the
location of regional highways and commercial areas. Although a portion of the traffic generated by
the site will use the driveway north of the proposed Pickle Barrel building, for the purposes of this

SANDERSON STEWART                                                                                      11
                                                                       PICKLE BARREL RESTAURANT TIS


analysis, it was assumed that this driveway would primarily be used by employees accessing the back
of the building during non-peak periods. The noon and PM peak hour traffic generated by the site
is expected to be made up entirely of customer traffic and would therefore access the site via the
Rosebud driveway. The trip distribution for the proposed development is illustrated in Figure 4.


TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT


Traffic assignment is the procedure where site-generated vehicle trips are assigned to the study area
intersections and site access driveways. The assignment of site-generated traffic is based on the
development's trip distribution, physical attributes of the development site, and the surrounding
street system. Based on this approach, the site-generated trips were assigned to the study area
roadway network as illustrated in Figure 4.


TRAFFIC IMPACTS


Existing + Project Traffic Volumes
Existing + Project traffic volumes represent an estimate of the traffic volumes forecasted to be on
the street network at the time period when the site is expected to be reconstructed. The resulting
combination of existing traffic volumes and the new site-generated traffic volumes is illustrated in
Figure 5. Because the redevelopment of the site is expected to occur in the immediate future, it was
not necessary to consider future background traffic growth in this analysis.


Existing + Project Capacity Analysis
Existing + Project intersection operations were evaluated using the same methodologies discussed in
the evaluation of existing conditions. The LOS analysis is based on the Existing + Project traffic
volumes shown in Figure 5, utilizing existing intersection geometry and traffic control at all
intersections. Table 3 summarizes the noon and PM peak hour Existing + Project LOS at the study
area intersections. The results for existing conditions are also provided for comparison purposes.

As shown in Table 3, the addition of traffic generated by the proposed Pickle Barrel Restaurant
would result in only very minor increases in approach delay. The existing capacity issue at the
intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud Drive would get even worse with the addition of site-
generated traffic, but none of the other impacts would be significant enough to result in degradation
in level of service. Detailed capacity calculation worksheets for the Existing + Project scenario are
provided in Appendix D.

Mitigation Measures
Improvement alternatives were evaluated to mitigate capacity concerns at the intersection of 32nd
Street West and Rosebud Drive. The most logical options for improvement include the installation
of a traffic signal or the installation of a raised median to limit the intersection to three-quarter
access.   These options are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.                  Capacity
calculations were performed for both of these alternatives as summarized in Table 4 on page 17.
Detailed capacity calculation reports and signal warrant worksheets are provided in Appendix E.

Improvement Alternative 1: Traffic Signal at 32nd Street West & Rosebud Drive
The first improvement alternative evaluated at the intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud
Drive was the installation of a traffic signal. For the purposes of this analysis, it was assumed that
the lane configurations would stay the same as existing conditions, and the signal would provide for
permitted left-turn movements only with the overall cycle length on the order of 80 seconds.
Capacity calculation results provided in Table 4 show that the eastbound approach to the
intersection would be improved from LOS F to LOS B for both peak periods, while the northbound
and southbound approaches could still be expected to operate at LOS A.


The need for a traffic signal at this intersection was further evaluated using the traffic signal warrants
provided in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), 2009 Edition. The three volume
warrants (warrants 1-3) were fairly easy to consider using the data collected for this study.
Additional data will need to be collected in order to complete a comprehensive warrant analysis that
addresses the remaining warrants.        Results of this preliminary analysis of warrants 1-3 (see
worksheets provided in Appendix E) show that the intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud
Drive would meet all three of the volume warrants for a traffic signal under existing conditions. The
need for a traffic signal (or some other form of intersection control) would only increase with the
addition of site-generated traffic.


Although the proposed traffic signal is likely warranted and capacity calculation results show that it
would provide for significant improvement over existing conditions, there are some valid concerns
associated with the signalized alternative. The primary concern is related to the close proximity to
the signalized intersection of 32nd Street West and King Avenue West. The distance between the
two intersections is approximately 600 feet and queues at the King Avenue West intersection have
occasionally backed up beyond the Henesta Drive intersection and near the Rosebud Drive
intersection. Therefore, if the signalized alternative is pursued, a critical component of the design
will be the need for coordination between these two intersections and throughout the 32nd Street
West corridor. While this alternative may be less desirable to the City of Billings due to the close
proximity between signals, it will certainly be the much more desirable alternative to nearby property

Improvement Alternative 2: Three-Quarter Access at 32nd Street West & Rosebud Drive
The second alternative evaluated for improvement to the intersection of 32nd Street West and
Rosebud Drive consists of installing a raised median within the vicinity of the intersection to
implement what is commonly referred to as three-quarter access control.          All of the existing
northbound and southbound movements would still be allowed, but the eastbound and westbound
movements would be limited to right-turn only. The eastbound/westbound thru and left-turn
movements would be eliminated. With this type of treatment, the minor approach delay can be
improved significantly by eliminating the wait time associated with making a left-turn onto the
higher-volume arterial roadway. As shown by the results in Table 4, this would be the case with this
particular intersection. The eastbound approach could be improved from LOS F to LOS B for both
the noon and PM peak periods.


This improvement alternative would likely be the more desirable alternative for the City of Billings
given their concerns about closely spaced signalized intersections. However, it will most definitely
be the less desirable alternative for surrounding property owners due to common complaints about
reduced access and overall effectiveness of these types of treatments for individual intersections
when the rest of the corridor does not have raised median. Results of this analysis show that either
improvement alternative would result in acceptable intersection operations for the Existing + Site
traffic volume scenario.    The final decision regarding which of the options would be most
appropriate for this intersection will have to be based on input provided by the City of Billings and
the adjacent property owners.


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


The preceding analysis provides a summary of existing conditions, as well as trip generation, traffic
assignment, and the resultant capacity analysis for the proposed Pickle Barrel Restaurant on 32nd
Street West. The new site is expected to generate approximately 310 new average weekday trips
with 75 and 21 new vehicle trips occurring during the noon and PM peak hours, respectively.
Capacity analysis results show that the proposed project would have only minor impacts to traffic
operations on the surrounding roadways.        However, an existing traffic capacity issue at the

intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud Drive would be made even worse with the addition of
traffic generated by the new Pickle Barrel Restaurant.


Two different improvement options were considered to alleviate the capacity concerns at this
intersection. The first option is the installation of a new traffic signal at the intersection and the
second is the installation of a raised median to limit access at the intersection to three-quarter access.
MUTCD traffic signal warrants would likely be met for both the existing and existing + site traffic
volume scenarios. Capacity calculation results show that either improvement alternative would
result in acceptable intersection operations for the Existing + Site traffic volume scenario.
Therefore, it is recommended that the final decision regarding which of the improvement
alternatives would be most appropriate for this location be based on input provided by the City of
Billings and the adjacent property owners.


The City of Billings will often times consider a developer contribution toward the cost of
improvements at an impacted intersection based on the development's portion of the total entering
volume at the intersection.      The Pickle Barrel's portion of the total entering volume at the
intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud Drive is 4% during the noon peak hour and 1%
during the PM peak hour. Therefore, based on this method of calculating developer contribution,
the developer of the Pickle Barrel Restaurant should not be responsible for more than 4% of the
cost of improvements.


It is recommended that a more comprehensive signal warrant analysis be completed for this
intersection prior to the installation of a traffic signal. Regardless of which improvement alternative
is ultimately selected, it is also recommended that the City of Billings consider an evaluation of
potential signal timing coordination for the 32nd Street West corridor.              With better traffic
progression between signalized intersections, overall corridor operations could likely be improved
significantly. These and any other improvements made shall be completed in accordance with City
of Billings standards and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), 2009 Edition. If
these improvements are implemented as recommended, traffic on area roadways should continue to
operate in a safe and efficient manner.

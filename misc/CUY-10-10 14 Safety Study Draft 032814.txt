    INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE AND NEED
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the existing safety performance and to identify potential
countermeasures that will reduce congestion and crashes at the intersection of State Route 10 (Lorain
Avenue) and County Route 66 (W. 150th Street) in the city of Cleveland, Ohio. The intersection of State
Route 10 at mile point 10.14 is ranked 96 on the ODOT (2010-2012) Urban Intersection Peak Searching
Excess Locations.

Crash Data was provided by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). During the 3-year period
between 2010 and 2012, there were a total of 70 reported crashes within the study area, which
encompasses a 0.3 mile buffer around the intersection on all four approaches. Within the total reported
crashes, 22.3% were injury (no fatalities), which is just below the statewide average of 25.4% for injury
crashes on a non-freeway (US, SR) system during the same period.

The following crash types and conditions are over represented on the study corridor compared to
statewide averages (shown in parenthesis). Note the statewide crash averages are based on 2008-2012
data whereas the project data encompasses years 2010 to 2012.
        Total crashes: 70 total crashes
        Rear end: 24 crashes or 34 percent                                            (30.9 percent)
        Left Turn: 17 crashes or 24 percent                                            (5.2 percent)
        Angle: 13 crashes or 19 percent                                               (15.6 percent)
        Pedalcycles: 2 crashes or 3 percent                                            (0.6 percent)
        Ages 15-25 and 65+: 20 crashes or 29 percent                                  (22.0 percent)

The crash types listed above are the top 3 crash types present at the intersection, accounting for 77 percent
of the total crashes.

BACKGROUND
Lorain Avenue is classified as a principal arterial which runs east-west and parallels I-90 to the north, and
I-71 to the south. West 150th Street runs north-south and becomes Warren Street, north of the intersection
with Lorain Avenue. For the purposes of this document, reference to West 150th Street will include both
the north and south approach legs. West 150th Street is classified as a minor urban arterial road. Land
uses along Lorain Avenue and West 150th Street is suburban residential with neighborhood commercial
land use. The project location is depicted in Figure 1.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
ROADWAY AND INTERSECTION CONDITIONS
The intersection of Lorain Avenue at W. 150th Street is a 4-leg signalized intersection. There is a
dedicated left turn lane at each approach of the intersection, as well as a through lane, and a shared
through/ right-turn lane.
Existing roadway conditions are summarized in Table 1.

                                                                               INTERESECTION ALIGNMENT
An angle point exists on the 150th Street/Warren Street approaches
to the intersection. The alignment of the southbound approach
results in an offset of about 6 feet across the intersection. Photo 1
shows the offset of southbound traffic in the inside through lane
with respect to the northbound left turn lane. The transition length
for the posted speed of 35 MPH is equal to 122 feet. The
available transition length measured to opposing stop lines is only
104 feet. In addition to the short transition length, the lack of
pavement markings within the intersection does not provide
guidance to through traffic. The effective taper for southbound
vehicles is adequate for speeds less than 30 MPH.

The angle point within the intersection also may affect the ability
of motorists in the northbound left turn lane to select adequate
gaps in opposing traffic. The angle point complicates the driving
task of the northbound left turning motorist. Research suggests
that two points on a vehicle are needed to judge approach speeds
(Gould, et al, 2011). Northbound motorists are not able to see the
side of opposing vehicles due to the approach angle of the
roadway thus reducing their ability to accurately judge approach speeds in the opposing through lanes.

Other features affecting operations of the southbound PHOTO 2: SOUTHBOUND TRAFFIC
approach include the following:                       POSITIONING IN LANE
      The existing trees in the tree lawn between the back of
      curb and sidewalk extend beyond the curb. The
      presence of trees affects the position of vehicles within
      the curb lane ­ vehicles favor the lane line between
      outside curb lane and the adjacent through lane. The
      position of vehicles exacerbates the transition across the
      intersection discussed above. Photo 2 shows the
      position of vehicles in the curb lane on the southbound
      approach.
      The trees in the tree lawn obscure the ground mount
      lane use signs on the southbound approach (red circle).
      Photo 3 shows the difficulty of seeing signs even in the
      absence of leaves on the trees. The ground mounted lane                   PHOTO 3: SOUTHBOUND
      use signs are not effective.                                              WARREN STREET
The west leg of Lorain Avenue was resurfaced as part of a project
completed within the study time period (PID 87518, completed August
2013). There are two construction projects planned by the City of
Cleveland and ODOT that impact the study intersection:

      Warren Road is to be rehabilitated from Lorain Avenue. The plans
      for the intersection of Lorain Avenue and W. 150th Street do not
      change the physical configuration of the intersection, but provide new
      traffic signal equipment (mast arm), including back plates, and
      detection for the left turn movements on all approaches. Relevant
      plan sheets from the project are included in Appendix A. (ODOT
      PID 91034)
      Stage 1 plans are being prepared for a resurfacing project on Lorain
      Avenue from W. 150th Street to W. 117th Street. (ODOT PID 84289)

TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONDITIONS
The Lorain Avenue and W. 150th Street intersection is controlled with a traffic signal for all 4 approaches.
Features of the existing traffic signal include the following:
         All (westbound, northbound, southbound, and eastbound) left turns are protected-permissive
         movements controlled with a 5-section head.
         There are pedestrian signal heads for all 4 crosswalks of the intersection.
         The existing cycle length is 90 seconds and is fixed time-based coordinated with the Triskett
         Road and Warren Road intersection located north of the study intersection.
         A 2 second all red clearance is programmed for all movements.

One single timing plan operates for the entire day and does not fluctuate based on time of day. The
timing is such that a minimum green time (7 seconds) is allotted for the protected left turn movements and
the remaining time in the cycle is used for the E-W and N-S permissive phases. On November 26, 2012,
the City of Cleveland changed the left turn phasing at the intersection from lag-lag permissive/ protected
left turn phasing to a lead-lead protected/ permissive left turn phasing on the 150th Street/ Warren Street
approaches.

During field observations that were conducted on February 13, 2014, a visibility issue with the Lorain
Avenue westbound left turn signal lens was noted. The signal phase is illuminated; however, it is not as
visible as other indications, resulting in start-up delays. Since the timing allotted for the lead left turn
movement is only 7 seconds, any start-up delay reduces the number of vehicles able to turn left during
that phase. On multiple cycles, only a single westbound left turn vehicle would be serviced during the
protected phase, and often that would occur during the amber portion of the phase. The lack of vehicles
clearing during the protected phase increased the westbound left turn queue -- as many as four vehicles
were observed turning at the end of the protected phase, extending into the parent phase for the
north/south approaches. The queue was observed in excess of 500 feet during the observation period.

Congestion on the W. 150th Street northbound approach appears to be magnified by a lack of coordination
with the traffic signals to the south of the project area. Operations at the interchange of W. 150th Street
with I-71 necessitate a cycle length of 130 seconds. The traffic signals between the I-71 interchange and
Lorain Avenue on W. 150th Street (including the W.150th Street intersections with Chatfield Avenue and
Emery Avenue), are coordinated, operating with a cycle length of 130 seconds. The traffic northbound
on W. 150th Street arrives in a very tight platoon at the Lorain Avenue intersection. That platoon often
arrives at the beginning of red on the northbound approach. This causes a significant queue that typically
clears after a couple of cycles, but still contributes to congestion on the northbound approach.

BUSINESS ACCESS AND PARKING
There are many access points within the functional area of the Lorain Avenue and W. 150th Street
intersection. The functional area of an intersection is defined as the area beyond the physical intersection
of two roadways. The functional area for a leg of an intersection includes two components: one upstream
of the physical area of the intersection and one downstream as shown in Figure 2. The upstream (or
intersection approach) includes additional length for decision-making, maneuvering, and required vehicle
storage. The downstream area consists of a conflict overlap distance that allows a through vehicle to clear
the intersection in addition to downstream conflict points. The downstream distance is calculated to be
250 feet based on a design speed of 35 MPH.

    A Shell gasoline station is located on the northeast quadrant of the intersection and has 4 unrestricted
    access driveways on Lorain Avenue and W. 150th Street. All of these access driveways are located
    within approximately 150 feet from the center of the intersection.
    Kmart is located on the Southeast quadrant of the intersection and has three access points, one on
    Lorain Avenue and two on W. 150th. A driveway for K-Mart intersects with W. 150th Street
    approximately 160 feet south of the intersection with Lorain Avenue. All ingress movements are
    permitted at the driveway. Although pavement markings on the driveway restrict the egress to right
    turn only, there are no physical islands present to enforce this restriction.


LAND USE
Land use within the study area consists of commercial and residential properties. The majority of
properties along Lorain Avenue are commercial properties including fast-food restaurants, shopping
centers, and gas stations. There is also a funeral home located east of the intersection along Lorain
Avenue. W. 150th Street to the south is predominately commercial land use with some residential
properties while W. 150th street to the north is predominately residential with some commercial
properties. Beyond the frontage properties along Lorain Avenue and W. 150th Street, particularly to the
north and east, a significant amount of residential exists.


DATA COLLECTION
Manual turning movement counts for the Lorain Avenue/ W. 150th Street intersection were conducted on
November 11, 2013 by TranSystems. Counts were conducted in the morning from 6:30 A.M. to 9:30
A.M., mid-day from 11:00 A.M. to 1:30 P.M., and in the evening from 3:00 P.M. to 6:30 P.M. Growth
rates were requested from NOACA for the study intersection. NOACA reported no growth for the future
year analysis. Count data and documentation from NOACA are provided in Appendix B.

Field observations on January 22, 2014 documented multi-cycle queues on the southbound approach to
the study intersection during the AM peak period. The over capacity condition occurred during a 30-
minute period from 7:30 to 8:00AM. The traffic data from TranSystems supports the field observation ­
traffic in through lanes on the southbound plateau around 230 vehicles. These are the highest volumes on
this approach at any time throughout the day. The turning movement counts were adjusted to account for
the demand volumes not being serviced by the current signal timing plan for the AM peak period: 10
vehicles added to the 7:30 time period and 20 vehicles added to the 7:45 time period.

Certified traffic was provided that was developed for the resurfacing project (PID 84289). The 2016 AM
and PM design hour volumes were generally 10% higher than the collected traffic data. The certified
traffic is included in Appendix B.

Note that one single timing plan operates for the entire day directional peak volumes by time of day.

    CRASH ANALYSIS
CRASH DATA
Crash Data was provided by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the Lorain Avenue
and West 150th Street intersection. The crash data represents a three-year study period from 2010 to
2012. Each documented report has been reviewed to confirm the accuracy and location of all crashes
within the study limits. Crash diagrams are provided in Appendix C.

HIGHWAY SAFETY MANUAL
The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) provides tools to conduct quantitative safety analyses with the
primary goal of predicting crash frequency and severity as a function of alternative roadway and
intersection designs. Prior to publication of the HSM in 2010, there was no industry-accepted
resource available to quantify future safety performance of a transportation facility. The HSM fills
this need by providing a science-based technical approach to safety analysis to predict "expected
average crash frequency" ­ the long-term average crash frequency of a site.

A primary reason for incorporating techniques of the Highway Safety Manual into the crash analysis
process is to overcome the short-term year-to-year variability in observed crash frequencies and the
effects of "regression to the mean" bias. Regression-to-the-mean (RTM) is the natural variation in
crash data. Crash occurrences at a given site are random events that tend to fluctuate up and down
over the course of time. Year-to-year variability in crash frequencies as shown in Figure 4 adversely
affects crash estimation based on crash data collected over short periods (i.e. 3 years as is customary).
The randomness of crash occurrences indicates that short-term crash frequencies alone are not a
reliable estimator of long-term crash frequency.

Crash fluctuations over time make it difficult to determine whether changes in the observed crash
frequency are due to changes in site conditions or are due to natural fluctuations. When a period of
high crash frequency is observed, it is statistically probable that the following period will have a
comparatively low crash frequency. Similarly, there is a high probability that a low crash frequency
period will be followed by a high crash frequency period. This tendency is known as regression-to-
the-mean (RTM).

Failure to account for the effects of RTM introduces the potential for "RTM bias" or "selection bias".
This occurs when sites are selected for treatment based on short-term trends in observed crash
frequency. RTM bias can also result in over or under estimation of effectiveness of a treatment
(change in average crash frequency) ­ without accounting for RTM bias, it is not possible to know if
an observed reduction in crashes is due to the treatment or if it would have occurred without the
modification.

                                                Years


Figure 5 shows the effect of RTM and RTM bias. In this example, a site is selected for treatment
based on its short term crash frequency trend over three years (during upward trend). Due to RTM, it
is probable that the observed crash frequency will decrease toward the expected average crash
frequency without any treatment. A treatment is applied which results in a reduction of crashes and
become the "perceived effectiveness of treatment". However, some of this reduction would have
occurred regardless of the treatment (due to RTM), rendering the perceived effectiveness of the
treatment to be greater than its actual effectiveness.

FIGURE 5: REGRESSION TO THE MEAN




The predictive method described in Part C of the Highway Safety Manual provides steps to estimate
the expected average crash frequency of a site for a given time period, geometric design, traffic
control features, and traffic volumes. The expected average crash frequency (Nexpected) is estimated
using a predictive model estimate of crash frequency for a specific site type (Npredicted) together with
observed crash frequency (where available), as described in the following sections. The predictive
method is applicable for the following facility types: Rural Two-Lane Two-Way Roads, Rural
Multilane Highways, and Urban/Suburban Arterials.

PREDICTED CRASH FREQUENCY
Predicted model estimate of crash frequency (Equation 1): This step involves determination of the
predicted crash frequency which reflects how a site would be expected to perform relative to 1,000
similar sites. Calculation of predicted crash frequency utilizes Safety Performance Functions (SPF)
for a base condition. Crash Modification Factors (CMF) are then applied to account for specific site
characteristics that differ from the base condition. A state-level calibration factor is then applied to
normalize the base condition to localized conditions. The resulting value is the Predicted Crash
Frequency (Npredicted)


        Equation 1


EXPECTED CRASH FREQUENCY
Expected average crash frequency (Equations 2 and 3): The next step involves calculation of the
expected average crash frequency which reflects average performance of the site over an extended
period of time based on actual crash history. This step incorporates the Empirical Bayes (EB) method
which combines actual (observed) crash history of the study site with predicted average crash
frequency. These values are weighted based on an over-dispersion parameter (k) that is the measure
of the strength of the model (safety performance factors). The resulting value is the expected average
crash frequency (Nexpected)



                                                                                            Equation 2

        Where k = over dispersion parameter from the associated SPF


OBSERVED CRASH HISTORY
Figure 6 shows the frequency of crashes has decreased between 2010 and 2012. Similarly, the
number of injury crashes has decreased especially in 2012. Specific changes to conditions in the field
within the study period (2010-2012) include the following:

        Left turn phasing change in November 2012. The original signal phasing of lag-lag
        (permissive/ protected) on the 150th/Warren Street approaches was in affect for the study
        period except of one month (December 2012). The change of signal phasing did not affect

The following sections address each of the high frequency crash patterns identified on the corridor.

REAR END CRASHES
Rear end crashes that have occurred at the Lorain Avenue and West 150th Street intersection comprise
34 percent of the crashes (24 out of the 70 crashes). A review of crash data indicates that rear end
crashes have a significant peak starting around 3 p.m., continuing through the peak commuter period
and ending after 7 p.m. Crashes observed during these hours account for 17 out of the 24 rear end
crashes at the intersection.

Congestion can be a contributing factor for rear end crashes. As noted above, the majority of these
crashes do occur around the same time of day. There are schools in the area that may contribute to an
increase in congestion during the 3:00 p.m. hour. The 3:00 p.m. traffic volume exceeds the PM peak
hour volume on the eastbound approach by 200 vehicles, which is evenly divided between the
through and right turn movements. Capacity analysis conducted for the 3:00 PM hour, indicates a
slight increase in delay on the eastbound and westbound approaches. Capacity analysis during the
AM and PM peak hours and the 3:00 PM hour concluded that the level of service is a D or better for
all of the intersection approaches and movements. Detailed capacity analysis can be found in
Appendix E.

LEFT TURN CRASHES
There were 17 left turn crashes at this intersection, comprising 24 percent of all crashes. Ten (10) of
the left turn crashes occurred on the northbound approach (turning west onto Lorain Avenue). Out of
all 10 crashes, only 3 of these crashes were identified with wet road conditions. Westbound Lorain
Avenue motorists turning southbound on W. 150th Street also account for 4 out of 17 left turn crashes
at this intersection.

ANGLE CRASHES                                  PHOTO 4: K-MART ACCESS DRIVEWAY EXIT ONTO
There were 13 angle crashes at Lorain W. 150TH ST.
Avenue and West 150th Street intersection,
constituting 19 percent of all crashes. The
majority occurred at driveways within a 200
feet radius from the intersection center. A
predominate area of angle crashes occurred at
the W. 150th Street and Kmart driveway. This
driveway does have pavement markings
restricting westbound motorists to right turns
only, but there are no active devices
prohibiting left turns.

An analysis of the crash history reveals the
driveway pavement marking to be ineffective.
There have been five left turn angle crashes at
this driveway in the three-year study period.
Westbound left turning of vehicles pull
through a queue in the northbound curb lane and collide with a northbound motorist positioned within
the inside through lane.

BICYCLE CRASHES
Bicycle crashes comprise only two of the seventy crashes that have occurred at the Lorain Avenue
and W. 150th Street intersection. The two bicycle crashes were reported on Lorain Avenue. In the
former, the bicyclist was traveling westbound on Lorain Avenue westbound and was struck by a car
driving in the right lane towards the intersection. In the latter, the bicyclist was riding on the
sidewalk, and the collision occurred at a driveway where sight was obstructed because of buildings.

    COUNTERMEASURES
Countermeasures are proposed to mitigate safety issues. The most common crash types for the
Lorain Avenue/ W. 150th Street intersection area are rear end and left turn crashes.

SHORT TERM COUNTERMEASURES
Change Lag-lag to lead-lead left turn phasing ­ 17 Crashes
During the study period (2010-2012), a lag left turn was provided on the northbound and southbound
approaches to the signalized intersection. This signal phasing can violate driver expectancy since
lead left turn signal phases are far more common than lag left signal phases. Transportation Research
Record 1324: Guidelines for Use of Leading and Lagging Left-Turn Signal Phasing (Hummer et al,
1991) identified a significant increase in driver confusion associated with lagging left turns when
compared to leading left turns at suburban intersections. This countermeasure was implemented
November 26, 2012.

Lane use sign upgrade
Relocate ground mounted lane use signs to the near side mast arm (future installation).
Reconstruction of the traffic signal is planned in 2014 using mast arm signal supports. The mast arm
length shown in the current signal plan should be extended to reach the exclusive left turn lane on
each approach.

MEDIUM TERM COUNTERMEASURES
Intersection alignment ­ 10 crashes
Modify the alignment of the southbound approach to correct the substandard transition through the
signalized intersection. Southbound traffic starting from a point about 150 feet north of the
intersection is realigned to a point on the far side of the intersection. No right of way is expected for
this improvement and an 8 ft sidewalk remains ­ 3 trees will be removed with this improvement.
This improvement will increase the effective taper across the intersection to exceed a design speed of
40 MPH. The ability of northbound left turning vehicles to select adequate gaps in opposing traffic
will also improve by aligning the southbound approach across the intersection. Figure 9 is a
conceptual plan showing the scope of work needed to improve the intersection alignment.

Access management ­ 5 crashes
Prohibit left turns from the K-Mart driveway on W. 150th Street to mitigate 5 angle crashes. The
installation of a No Left Turn sign (MUTCD R3-2) facing westbound traffic may discourage some
left turns. Alternatives to this countermeasure include the installation of a physical barrier at this
driveway, accomplished through one of two means:

         Install median barrier along centerline of Lorain Avenue at the K-Mart driveway. A median
         barrier installed in this location would prevent motorists from turning left out of the K-Mart
         driveway, and also prevent southbound motorists on Lorain Avenue from turning left into the
         driveway. The median barrier could consist of a physical median or flexible delineators
         (Quik Kurb).

         The constrained width of Lorain Avenue should be considered when determining the
         appropriate countermeasure; at 52 feet wide, with a five-lane cross-section at the driveway,
         installation of a physical median would result in an average lane width of less than 10 feet. If
         the roadway cannot be widened, installation of bollards would therefore be the most
         promising course if this strategy is selected.

         Install "pork chop" island on the K-Mart property. Installation of a pork chop island would
         deter left turn movements from the driveway but not prevent the movement. This strategy
         would require coordination with the site property owners.

     COST-BENEFIT ANAYSIS
CHANGE LAG-LAG TO LEAD-LEAD LEFT TURN PHASING
The CMF Clearinghouse indicates that the strategy of changing left turn phasing at an intersection
from lag-lag to lead-lead is associated with a CMF (crash modification factor) of .31. Incorporating
this CMF for left turn crashes as part of the ECAT analysis, it was determined that this
countermeasure would have the following effect in reducing crashes.

 Conditions
*Reflects base conditions with Part C countermeasures included. 


As indicated in Table 2, the change in signal phasing is anticipated to reduce the number of crashes at
this intersection by slightly more than two crashes per year compared with the scenario of Expected
Conditions with Part C countermeasures. Based upon the analysis of safety benefits provided in
ECAT, and assuming a 20 year service life for the timing change, this countermeasure is anticipated
to have a Net Present Value of $1,019,134.

SOUTHBOUND REALIGNMENT
Realignment of the southbound approach is estimated to cost $41,000 if constructed by 2017. This
improvement should be coordinated with another pavement project to avoid an increased cost due to
small quantities. The crash patterns also should be monitored to evaluate if the change in phasing,
overhead lane use signs, signal upgrade, have the desired effect in reducing left turn crashes. A cost
benefit ratio was not calculated for this improvement due in part to the other planned improvements
and their impact on safety performance.

ACCESS MANAGEMENT
The Highway Safety Manual calculates CMF's for access management countermeasures only within
an intersection, and not for roadway segments. However, based on a significant amount of literature
in this field, there will be a benefit to safety by imposing left turn prohibitions at the driveway. As
stated in the HSM, Volume 3: "It is intuitive and generally accepted that reducing the number of
access points within the functional areas of intersections reduces the potential for crashes."
Specifically, restricting access to commercial properties near intersections "reduces conflicts between
through and turning traffic," and "angle crashes related to vehicles turning into and out of driveways."
The HSM further emphasizes that "access points located within 250 feet upstream or downstream of
an intersection are undesirable." As noted earlier, the northernmost driveway is 160 feet from the
intersection. A cost benefit ratio was not calculated for this improvement.

LJB is working with District 12 on several safety study locations. Attached is current traffic data for these locations.
                                                   th
1. CUY-10-10.14 (Lorain Road (SR 10) at W. 150 Street)
                                              th
2. CUY-10-11.94 (Lorain Road (SR 10) at W. 117 Street)
3. CUY-17-11.57 (Brookpark Road (SR 17) at Broadview Road (SR 176))
                                                               
4. CUY-422-4.34 (Kinsman Road (US 422) at E. 93rd Street)
5. LAK-84-8.14 (Johnnycake Ridge Road (SR 84) at Broadmoor Road (SR 306))

Typically planning level growth rates are sufficient for use on a safety study. I am interested in a 20 year horizon.

Please advise when you are able to generate these numbers?

Thank you

    CLEARANCE CALCULATIONS
The National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 731: Guidelines for Timing
Yellow and All-Red Intervals at Signalized Intersections was published in July 2012. A number of
conclusions were reached as a result of the comprehensive study that is important to the safety
performance of signalized intersections.
    ! The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Proposed Recommended Practice for the
      calculation of yellow change intervals and all-red clearance intervals is the methodology used by
      the highest percentage of state and local agencies.
    ! Drivers were documented to decelerate when turning at an intersection. The NCHRP Report 731
      recommended using a design speed of 20 miles per hour for the calculation of all red timing.
      Research conducted by the North Carolina Department of Transportation published by the ITE
      Journal determined that the average operating speed for left turning traffic is 17 miles per hour.
    ! Using the current ITE guidelines to calculate the duration of yellow change and red clearance
      intervals has been shown to reduce total crashes between 8 and 14 percent while reducing injury
      crashes by approximately 12 percent.
    ! Using the current ITE guidelines to calculate the duration of yellow change and red clearance
      intervals has been shown to reduce red light running occurrences between 36 and 50 percent.
Vehicle clearance times were calculated for the W. 150th Street/Loraine Avenue intersection based on
guidelines published in the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the ITE Proposed
Recommended Practice. For the purposes of the clearance calculations, the posted speed limits were
utilized, 25 mph on Lorain Avenue and 35 mph on W. 150th Street, for the through phases. For the
protected left turn phases, 25 mph was used for all approaches.
The calculated clearance times, as well as existing times, are summarized in Table A. Calculations are
included as well.

Note: The maximum threshold all-red clearance time is 3 seconds. Calculated values may be longer than 3 seconds.

Since the calculated total clearance times (Y+AR) are within less than a second of the existing, changes to
the clearance times are not being recommended as a safety countermeasure.

    CAPACITY ANALYSIS
Traffic operations were analyzed using Synchro Version 8 (results were output to HCM2010
methodology) to assess the traffic performance and operational efficiency of the intersection of W. 150th
Street and Lorain Avenue. The analysis results include the approach delay (measured in seconds of
delay), volume-capacity (v/c) ratio, and level of service (LOS) for each approach as well as the overall
intersection. Average delay is an indication of the expected delay that would typically be experienced in
the lane, on the approach, or at the intersection. A v/c ratio that is less than 1.0 indicates that the lane is
operating below capacity. A v/c ratio of 1.0 indicates that the lane is operating at capacity and a v/c
greater than one indicates over-capacity conditions. Level of service (LOS) is a grading scale based upon
average delay, with LOS A representing free-flow conditions, LOSE E representing operational capacity
and LOS F representing over-capacity. The specific delay thresholds for assessing intersection
performance are provided by the Transportation Research Board in the Highway Capacity Manual, as
shown in Table A.

Traffic signal operation was evaluated at the W. 150th Street and Lorain Avenue intersection using the
existing signal timing with the AM and PM peak hours and the 3:00 PM hour.

Field observations on January 22, 2014 documented multi-cycle queues on the southbound approach to
the study intersection during the AM peak period. The over capacity condition occurred during a 30-
minute period from 7:30 to 8:00AM. The traffic data from TranSystems supports the field observation ­
traffic in through lanes on the southbound plateau around 230 vehicles. These are the highest volumes on
this approach at any time throughout the day. The turning movement counts were adjusted to account for
the demand volumes not being serviced by the current signal timing plan for the AM peak period: 10
vehicles added to the 7:30 time period and 20 vehicles added to the 7:45 time period.

The proposed condition evaluated removed the protected left turn phase from the eastbound approach.
The eastbound left turn is a minor volume that can be accommodated during the permissive phase. The
current signal operation is fixed time only which does not allow fluctuations in the timing plan to
accommodate vehicle and pedestrian demand, so the overall splits are dictated by the required pedestrian
clearance intervals. The results are provided in Table B. Detailed reports are included at the end of this
section.

 *Capacity analysis was conducted using Synchro8. Results were exported to HCS2010 methodology. **based on Certifed Traffic,
 dated March 4, 2014

The existing signal timing is operating as fixed time, without actuation. The protected left turns operate
under a fixed 7 seconds of green time. The left turn volumes both for the northbound and westbound
approaches are high. The 7 seconds of protected green time is short for the left turn movements, resulting
in LOS F on both the westbound and northbound left turn movements. The through movement phases are
based primarily on the needed pedestrian walk and change intervals. Operating under a 90 second cycle
length, without pedestrian actuation, there isn't additional green time available to assign to the protected left
turn phases.

The addition of dual left turn lanes on the northbound and westbound approaches was investigated, but was
only found to have an incremental benefit the overall delay and resulted in a low LOS on the westbound left
turn and northbound left turn movements. Dual left turn lanes would require protected-only phasing,
which removes the permissive time when left turning vehicles can currently execute their turn.

The 3:00 PM hour was also analyzed due to the high crash trend during the 3:00 PM hour. The traffic
volume for the 3:00 PM hour on the eastbound approach exceeds the PM peak hour volume by 200
vehicles, divided evenly between the through movement and the right turn movement. The operational
capacity of the eastbound approach is reduced from a LOS C during the PM peak hour to LOS D during the
3:00 PM hour, but the delay is only increased from 30.8 seconds to 39.8 seconds. There is some additional
congestion experienced on both the eastbound and westbound approaches, but it is not comparable to the
increase of crashes during that hour.

    APPENDIX F
 STORAGE AND QUEUE
LENGTH CALCULATIONS
    STORAGE LANE LENGTHS
Turn lane storage lengths were calculated using guidelines specified in the Location and Design Manual
Section 401 (Ohio Department of Transportation). Lane lengths based on ODOT standard criteria assume
posted speed limit and include both vehicle storage and a 50 foot diverging taper. The ODOT
methodology considers both the storage needed for the left turning traffic and the through queue
blockage. A summary of the storage length calculation results and existing lengths are shown in Table A
with calculations appended to this section.
Turn lane lengths were calculated using the following parameters:
    ! Higher of the AM or PM peak hour traffic volume for the 2016 year (certified traffic).
    ! 35 mph posted speed on W. 150th Street.
    ! 25 mph posted speed on Lorain Avenue.
    ! Lengths presented, based on ODOT calculation, include vehicle storage, deceleration, and 50-foot
      diverging taper.

WB LEFT TURN              150 FT          300 FT          300 FT


As shown in Table A, The westbound Lorain Avenue left turn storage lane is deficient by 150 feet (150 ft
provided vs. 300 ft. minimum). The northbound left turn storage lane is less than the preferred storage
length, which is based on through queue blocking, by 88 ft. The left turn lane on both the northbound and
westbound approaches is developed from a two-way-left-turn-lane (TWLTL), which can provide
overflow storage for the turn lane. The calculation is based on a peak hour condition, for other times of
the day when the demand is not as heavy, the left turn vehicles are not likely to need the full minimum
storage and the TWLTL will accommodate access to the business driveways and cross-streets within the
influence area.

SUBJECT:             Traffic Control Study: McNaughton Avenue West at Keil Drive
                     North, Community of Chatham


This report is for the information of Council.


BACKGROUND

The Engineering and Transportation Division received a request from Council to
determine if an All-Way Stop control is required at the intersection of McNaughton
Avenue West and Keil Drive North in the Community of Chatham.

Similar studies were completed at the intersection of McNaughton Avenue and Keil
Drive North in years 2005 and 2006. In both studies an All-Way Stop Warrant Analysis
and a Traffic Signal Justification Analysis was completed for the intersection. Both
studies determined that an All-Way Stop control was not warranted and a Traffic Signal
control was not justified based on traffic volume and collision data observed at that time.

A traffic impact study was completed at the intersection in 2007. This study was
initiated to assess the potential traffic impacts caused by the planned extension of the
Dale Drive roadway to Bear Line Road and the planned construction of a new
elementary school adjacent to the new roadway. The traffic impact study predicts a
need for an All-way Stop at the intersection of McNaughton Avenue West and Keil Drive
North by year 2017, depending on the actual traffic generated by a new school and
additional residential development in the area. The study suggests additional
monitoring of the intersection is needed as traffic volumes increase. The study also
suggests retrofitting the intersection into a single lane roundabout as an alternative to
installing an All-Way Stop traffic control.

Engineering and Transportation Division completed an All-Way Stop Warrant analysis
and Traffic Signal Justification analysis at the intersection in 2011. The analysis
determined that both an All-Way Stop control was not warranted and Traffic Signal
control was not justified based on traffic count and collision data observed at that time.

The eastbound and westbound approaches on McNaughton Avenue West consist of
one combination thru lane and right turn lane and one left turn lane. The northbound
approach on Keil Drive North consists of one combination thru and left lane and a
channelized right turn lane. The southbound approach on Keil Trail North consists of
one combination thru and right turn lane and one left turn lane. Also, the northbound
and southbound lanes on Keil Trail North are separated by a large median island just
north of the intersection. The median island contains ornamental gateway structures,
tall standing evergreen trees, and other landscaping items.

The current traffic control at the intersection consists of stop signs in the northbound
and southbound directions. The channelized right turn lane is controlled by a yield sign
at the merge area. Vehicles on the channelized lane must yield right of way to
eastbound traffic on McNaughton Avenue West when merging.

Parking is permitted on the north side of McNaughton Avenue West but has been
removed on both sides of the roadway within the limits of the intersection infrastructure.
Parking is prohibited on both sides of Keil Drive North and Keil Trail North. Heavy
vehicles are prohibited on McNaughton Avenue West, Keil Drive North, and Keil Trail
North. The speed limit on each roadway is 50 km/h.

Sidewalks enter the intersection on the south side of McNaughton Avenue West from
the east and west and on both sides of Keil Trail North. There are no sidewalks south
of the intersection along Keil Drive North.

CK Transit services this area with a westbound bus operating through the intersection
on McNaughton Avenue West. A bus stop is located on the south side of McNaughton
Avenue West just west of the intersection.

Land development in the area consists of low to medium density residential properties
with additional residential property development progressing to the north of the
intersection along Keil Trail North, Dale Drive, and Morning Glory Lane. In addition, a
school (École élémentaire catholique Sainte-Marie) is located on Dale Drive west of Keil
Trail North.

Traffic Data

A turning movement traffic count was completed on Wednesday, September 12, 2012
at the intersection of McNaughton Avenue West at Keil Drive North. Details of the traffic
count data are shown in Appendix A.

The traffic count data indicates that the McNaughton Avenue West approaches provide
the highest proportion of traffic entering the intersection with approximately 57% of the
total intersection traffic vehicle volume. The vehicle movements with the highest
proportion of intersection traffic volume are the westbound left turn movement on
McNaughton Avenue West at approximately 27% and the northbound right turn volume
on Keil Drive North at approximately 23%.

Collision data for the intersection was obtained from Engineering and Transportation
Division records. Over the five year period from January 1, 2007 to December 31,
2011, a total of nine collisions were recorded. The collisions recorded at the
intersection during this period are summarized in Table 1:

All-Way Stop Warrant

The method used to evaluate the need for an All-way Stop traffic control device at the
intersection of McNaughton Avenue West and Keil Drive is based on the Ontario Traffic
Manual (Book 5: Regulatory Signs) All-Way Stop Warrant for major roads. Vehicle and
pedestrian traffic volumes and collision data are required for the All-Way Stop Warrant
analysis. Further details of the warrant are described in Appendix B.

A channelized right turn is not considered part of the intersection when completing an
All-Way Stop Warrant analysis. Therefore, all vehicles completing a northbound right
turn through the channelized right turn lane at the intersection are excluded from the
analysis.

Only collision types that are considered correctable by implementing an All-Way Stop
traffic control are applied to the warrant. Applicable types include right angle and
turning movement collisions. Non-applicable types include approaching, rear-end,
sideswipe, and single motor vehicle collisions.

The All-Way Stop Warrant consists of a Minimum Volume warrant and a Collision
warrant. An All-Way stop is considered justified if either warrant is met. The results of
the All-Way Stop Warrant analysis are shown in Appendix C and summarized in Table
2.

Based on the All-Way Stop Warrant analysis completed for the intersection of
McNaughton Avenue West at Keil Drive, an All-Way Stop traffic control device is not
warranted.

Traffic Signal Justification

The method used to evaluate the need for a Traffic Signal control device at the
intersection of McNaughton Avenue West and Keil Drive is based on the Ontario Traffic
Manual (Book 12: Traffic Signals) Traffic Signal Justification for major roads. Vehicle
and pedestrian traffic volumes and collision data are required for the Traffic Signal
Justification analysis.

The same turning movement traffic count used for the All-Way Stop Warrant analysis
was used for the Traffic Signal Justification analysis. As with the All-Way Stop analysis,
all vehicles completing a northbound right turn through the channelized right turn lane
are excluded.

Collision data for the intersection was obtained from Engineering and Transportation
Division records. Only collision types that are considered correctable by implementing a
Traffic Signal control are applied to the warrant. Applicable types include right angle
and turning movement collisions. Non-applicable types include approaching, rear-end,
sideswipe, and single motor vehicle collisions.

The Traffic Signal Justification analysis consists of a Minimum Vehicle Volume
justification, Delay to Cross Traffic justification, Volume/Delay Combination justification,
Minimum Four Hour Vehicle Volume justification and a Collision Experience justification.

A Pedestrian Volume justification is also part of the Traffic Signal Justification analysis
but was not applied in this study. A Traffic Signal is considered justified if any
justification is fully (100%) met. The results of the Traffic Signal Justification analysis
are shown in Appendix D and summarized in Table 3.

Based on the Traffic Signal Justification analysis completed for the intersection of
McNaughton Avenue West at Keil Drive North, a Traffic Signal control device is not
justified.

General Discussion

Residential property development to the north of the intersection along Keil Trail North
and Dale Drive combined with construction of road links connecting this area into
Baldoon Road and Gregory Drive West will continue to change traffic volumes and
patterns at the intersection. Monitoring of the intersection through periodic traffic counts
and collision data reviews will need to continue.
Traffic Control Study: McNaughton Avenue West at Keil Drive North, Community of Chatham   7

Conclusion

Traffic volume conditions and collision records for the intersection of McNaughton
Avenue West and Keil Drive North currently do not warrant the installation of an All-Way
Stop control or justify a Traffic Signal control.


CONSULTATION

Collision data records kept by the Engineering and Transportation Division are based on
Motor Vehicle Accident reports provided by the Chatham-Kent Police Services.

                     Ontario Traffic Manual - All Way Stop Warrants


A)        Minimum Volume Warrant

Arterial and Major Roads

All-Way Stop control may be considered on major roads where each of the following
conditions is met:

     i)       The total vehicle volume on all intersection approaches exceeds 500
              vehicles per hour for each of any eight hours of the day;

     ii)      The combined vehicular and pedestrian volume on the minor street exceeds
              200 units per hour (all vehicles plus pedestrians wishing to enter the
              intersection) for each of the same eight hours, with an average delay to
              traffic on the minor street (either vehicles or pedestrians wishing to enter the
              intersection) of greater than 30 seconds; and

     iii)     The volume split does not exceed 70/30. Volume on the minor street
              includes all vehicles plus any pedestrians wishing to cross the major
              roadway.

Minor Roads

All-way Stop control may be considered on minor roads where each of the following
conditions is met:

     i)       Total vehicle volume on all intersection approaches exceeds 350 for the
              highest hour recorded; and

     ii)      Volume split does not exceed 75/25 for three way control or 65/35 for four
              way control. Volume is defined as vehicles only.


B)        All-Way Stop Collision Warrant

For the purposes of this warrant, a high accident frequency is an average of four
collisions per year over a three year period. Only those accidents susceptible to relief
through multi-way stop control must be considered (i.e., right angle and turning
movement collisions).

Note: The All Way Stop is Warranted if either Part A or Part B criteria is met. All
conditions listed in Part A for Arterial and Major Roads or Minor Roads must be met.

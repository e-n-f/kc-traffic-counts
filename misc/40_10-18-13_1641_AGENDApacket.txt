BACKGROUND:

MEMORANDUM

DATE:  October 14, 2013
TO: Mayor and City Council
FROM: Kent L. Taylor, City Manager
SUBJECT: Agenda Items for Regular Meeting of October 22, 2013


Item 2: Interview of Planning Commission Candidate
Planning Commissioner Jerry Koch has advised staff that he will be moving out of state at the end of this
year, therefore requiring his resignation from the Commission. In notifying staff of this situation, he
indicated that he would step aside sooner if the City were able to find a suitable replacement. With
Planning Commission training presently occurring, staff felt it timely to bring someone new to the position
now, if such a candidate could be found. Staff has advertised for Mr. Koch's vacant Ward 3 position and
has received an application from Erica Thomas, a copy of which is included in the Council packet. As
has been past practice, staff will invite Ms. Thomas to the Council's meeting so that you can ask
questions of her. Questions for the Council's use will be provided by staff at the dinner meeting.

RECOMMENDATION : Interview Erica Thomas for appointment to the Planning Commission and, if
appropriate, select her to complete Mr. Koch's remaining term (expires December 31, 2014).


Item 3: Informational Update on Issues Related to the Riverbend Landfill
Yamhill County Planning Director, Mike Brandt, will provide an informational update on issues and
activities related to the Riverbend Landfill. Mike will be giving a brief update on activities and any
decisions that have occurred regarding the landfill during the past few months and answering questions
of the Council.

This is an informational item and no formal Council action is being requested.
Item 6: Resolution ­ Establishing a Transient Lodging Tax Advisory Committee
In June, 2013 the City Council approved implementation of a transient lodging tax to be effective January
1, 2014. Part of that legislation requires the Council to establish an advisory committee that would review
and make recommendations to the Council on the expenditure of the 70% of the revenues earmarked for
tourism promotion and tourism-related facilities. At the October 8, 2013 Council meeting, the Council
discussed a draft resolution. The resolution before you for a vote is the one upon which there was
Council consensus at the October 8, 2013 meeting.
RECOMMENDATION:  Adoption of the resolution as presented.
                                                                                       a.

1.                   OLD BUSINESS

1.a.                 3RD QUARTER PROGRESS REPORT ­ COUNCIL'S 2013 GOALS AND
                     OBJECTIVES: City Manager Taylor overviewed the 2013 Goals
                     and Objectives and stated that the report was an update on
                     the progress staff had through the third quarter of the
                     year. He outlined the progress on each of the goals.

                     Each of the Councilors present thanked Mr. Taylor and staff
                     for the remarkable advancements that had been made.

1.b.                 REVIEW AND DISCUSSION OF PROPOSED RESOLUTION ESTABLISHING
                     THE TRANSIENT LODGING TAX ADVISORY COMMITTEE: Council
                     President Yoder advised that this topic had been discussed
                     at the Dinner Meeting and asked if the Council had any
                     questions before the resolution was sent back to staff for
                     finalizing.

                     Responding to Councilor Jeffries' inquiry regarding how the
                     Committee would be organized, Mr. Taylor stated that it

                                              2
                                                        DRAFT
       would be staff's job to help the group become organized.
       He explained that the Committee would follow the open
       meeting rules and minutes would be kept. City Attorney
       Haines added that the Committee members would also enact
       bylaws for themselves. He noted that as the draft
       resolution is currently set out, the Council may appoint a
       member from itself, or a staff member, as an ex-oficio or
       liaison to the committee. He noted that the committee
       would be strictly advisory in nature and would send
       recommendations to the Council where the final decisions
       would be made.

       McMinnville Downtown Association Manager Cassie Sollars
       stated that she believed it looked very complete.
       McMinnville Area Chamber of Commerce President Phil
       Hutchinson agreed with her assessment.

       Councilor Menke asked about the types of agencies that had
       applied for funds while Mr. Hutchinson was in Newport. Mr.
       Hutchinson responded that although Newport's transient
       lodging tax went into effect several years before the
       current Oregon State laws overseeing this industry were
       enacted, he recalled that at least 50 percent of the funds
       went directly to tourism and supported the committee that
       organized the Loyalty Days organization and funded the
       annual fire-works displays. Additionally, there were
       instances that smaller groups also took advantage of the
       funds. He suggested that there could be some funding
       available for small grants that would allow an organization
       to print a new brochure, or for an activity of a local
       service club.

       By consensus the City Council referred the draft resolution
       back to staff for finalization. Mr. Taylor advised that
       the resolution would be completed and ready for a vote at
       the October 22, 2013 City Council meeting.

2      NEW BUSINESS

2.a.   PRESENTATION BY THE McMINNVILLE DOWNTOWN ASSOCIATION ON
       CURRENT ACTIVITIES AND ITS 2013 ­ 2014 BUDGET PLANS:
       McMinnville Downtown Association (MDA) Manager Cassie
       Sollars thanked the Council for the opportunity to share
       with them the MDA activities from the past year and those
       scheduled for the current fiscal year which just began on
       October 1. She gave a PowerPoint presentation that
       highlighted the changes to the downtown area from
       McMinnville's early history to today. She observed how the
       downtown has changed over time and how welcoming it looks
       now. She presented the Council with statistics of new
       businesses, vacancies, new employees, and renovation and
       remodeling that has occurred over the past year. She
       pointed out that McMinnville is just one of four Oregon
       Mainstreet organizations that has achieved National
       Mainstreet designation, and is one of just seven Oregon
       Performing Main Streets. Ms. Sollars emphasized the
       importance of preserving the downtown's historic buildings.

       Ms. Sollars discussed the annual budget and the sources
       from which the MDA receives funding. She also reviewed the
       expenses the Association must pay. Ms. Sollars added that
       she and her assistant, Kendra Lindell, are downtown a great
       deal of time visiting with the merchants and visitors to
       the area. There is a great deal of face-to-face
       communication that happens. Additionally, all property
       owners that have e-mail are sent the newsletter and all
       receive formal communication once or twice yearly through a
       letter.

       In conclusion, Ms. Sollars quoted from Winston Churchill,
       "We shape our buildings; thereafter, our buildings shape
       us."

       Each of the Council members present enthusiastically
       thanked Ms. Sollars for her presentation and stated that so
       much goes on downtown and presentations such as this helps
       to keep them up to date.

       mobile radios. Motorola Solutions and Day Wireless are the
       only vendors in the Willamette Valley who met the
       established criteria and staff received bids from both
       vendors.

       Following a thorough review of the bids, staff determined
       that the bid of Day Wireless of $35,010.00 annually was the
       lowest responsible bid. This bid also includes access to

       public hearing at the September 24, 2013 City Council
       meeting, staff was directed to prepare the final ordinance
       and to include a sunset clause to bring the ordinance back
       to the Council for review within one year; Section 11.20

Executive Summary
Riverbend Landfill Company, Inc. (RLC) is requesting a plan amendment and zone change (PA/ZC)
affecting the existing Riverbend Landfill and ancillary facilities located at 13469 SW Highway 18,
approximately 2 miles southwest of the McMinnville city limits in Yamhill County. In 1980, the
County approved a PA/ZC from Exclusive Farm Use (EFU) to Public Works/Safety (PWS) to
allow development of Riverbend Landfill.1 At the time, although solid waste disposal sites were
permissible uses in an EFU zone under state law, the County's 1976 zoning ordinance allowed
landfills as an outright permitted use only in the PWS zoning district. The County therefore
approved the zone change through an "Exception" to Statewide Planning Goal (Goal) 3, allowing
the conversion of EFU land to PWS.

Riverbend Landfill has operated at this location since 1982 under County land use and license
approvals and in accordance with Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Solid
Waste Disposal Permit 345. The current DEQ permit authorizes disposal of municipal solid waste
(MSW) on about 87 acres.2 Under that permit, the landfill is expected to reach capacity in 2017.

In 2009, the County determined there was a demonstrated need for the continued presence of a
landfill in the County. That determination was made as part of a PA/ZC that authorized the
expansion of Riverbend Landfill through another Goal 3 Exception. On appeal of that decision, and
at the express urging of the petitioners to that appeal, the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA)
reversed the County's decision on the basis that a Goal 3 Exception is not available to allow a use
that is already authorized by the statutory EFU zone (Oregon Revised Statutes [ORS] Chapter 215).
In doing so, LUBA stated, "[i]f the county wishes to allow landfills on agricultural land, it must
amend its EFU zone to allow them under the standards set forth in the statutory EFU zone, with
any supplementary regulation that the county wishes to adopt."3 The Court of Appeals upheld that
decision based on the same reasoning.4

Following the guidance of LUBA and the Court of Appeals, the Yamhill County Board of
Commissioners (Board) adopted a text amendment to the County's EFU zone in 2011 that mirrors
the statutory use in ORS 215.283(2)(k) and allows solid waste sites to be maintained, enhanced or
expanded within the EFU zone in some, but not all, of the specific circumstances allowed by state

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                                         ES-1
Riverbend Landfill                                                                                      September 2013
law.5 On appeal of that code change, LUBA affirmed the County's decision that the code change
was consistent with the Goals and with the County's Comprehensive Plan.

Based on this land use and legal history, RLC is requesting to rezone portions of Map 5501, Tax
Lots 101, 200 and 401 that are currently zoned PWS and Recreation Commercial (RC) back to their
original EFU designation (Figure 1). Yamhill County's amended EFU zone now allows solid waste
disposal sites as a permitted use, consistent with state law. The existing landfill and all ancillary
facilities will be maintained wholly within the farm zone with approval of this PA/ZC. RLC will
then have the opportunity to submit an application for a future expansion onto other property it
owns that is zoned EFU. Any future expansion would be subject to the limitations in ORS 215.296,
which require specific developments to demonstrate that they do not force a significant change in
farm or forest practices or costs on surrounding lands. Such developments would be subject to
approval through the County's Site Design Review process, which addresses the compatibility of a
specific development with surrounding land uses.

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Proposal
This application proposes to change all areas currently designated Public Works/Safety (PWS ­
218.3 acres) and Recreation Commercial (RC ­ 25 acres) to Exclusive Farm Use (EFU). As shown in
Table 1, the requested PA/ZC affects three parcels owned by RLC: Map 5501 ­ Tax Lots 101, 200
and 401. Each of those parcels contains split zoning. Approval of this PA/ZC would result in a net
increase of 243.3 acres zoned EFU relative to existing zoning, and RLC's entire tract would contain
only one zoning designation ­ EFU.

Obtaining County approval of the PA/ZC to EFU is a necessary first step for RLC to proceed with
a subsequent Site Design Review application for the conceptual Future Expansion Area shown in
Figure 2. The Future Expansion Area would affect three tax parcels: Map 5501- Tax Lots 101, 400
and 401. Tax Lot 400 is already zoned EFU.

As part of this PA/ZC application, RLC is describing the likely impacts associated with the Future
Expansion Area shown in Figure 2 to address compliance with the Goals, the Yamhill County
Comprehensive Plan and the Yamhill County Zoning Ordinance (YCZO). However, the PA/ZC to
EFU would not constitute approval of the Future Expansion Area. Detailed plans and information
and a separate County review process will be required to (1) comply with YCZO 402.02(V), (2)
address the requirements in Section 1101 (Site Design Review) and (3) satisfy the standards set forth
in ORS 215.296 (1) (a) and (b) relating to impacts of the non-farm uses on existing farm practices
and costs.

Over the past three years, RLC has been reaching out to landfill neighbors and the broader
community, listening, and responding to specific issues and concerns regarding the existing landfill
operation and potential future expansion. RLC hosted more than 25 community meetings and
service group presentations in McMinnville and Newberg in 2012-13. Riverbend representatives
have briefed elected officials and answered questions at city council meetings across the county. This
PA/ZC application and Conceptual Expansion Plan (see Figure 2) differ substantially from RLC's
2008 application as a result of community input received in the course of this outreach campaign. As
a result of these community conversations, Riverbend's conceptual plans reduce the size of the
future landfill expansion by 62 percent and add a Green Technology component to minimize the
landfill expansion. Conceptual plans also limit the height of the future landfill to the height of the
existing landfill as permitted by DEQ. In addition, plans include community meetings to solicit
input on landscaping designs to ensure adequate visual screening along Highway 18 frontage. Key
distinctions between the two applications are summarized in Table 2.

elements of the Future Expansion Area are summarized below:

           Landfill footprint expanded by approximately 37 acres. Maintain existing approved landfill
           height (284 feet MSL ­ or 135 feet above ground) and 100-foot setback from top of bank of
           two streams and South Yamhill River.
           Approximately 25-acre site reserved for Green Technology facility.
           Primary access to landfill and Green Technology facility retained at existing location.
           Approximately 26 acres identified for future operations/support facilities/uses (including
           but not limited to storage and laydown areas, stormwater facilities, monitoring wells, etc.)

RLC has projected the future available airspace6 at approximately 7.4 million tons if the County
approves the PA/ZC. RLC has established 510,000 tons per year as the baseline for the amount of
waste likely to be received at Riverbend Landfill. Unlike the 2008 application, no annual growth rate
in disposal volumes has been applied over the life of the site. RLC instead expects annual tonnage to
remain flat based on Waste Management's continuing efforts to divert specific wastes to other
company facilities, increasing recycling rates as a result of the new recycling center at Riverbend
Landfill, and continued advancement of community recycling and recovery programs that will offset
growth in disposal volumes in the future.

Consistent with state, county and community solid waste management priorities, RLC is aggressively
pursuing opportunities to develop a new Green Technology facility at Riverbend Landfill. One
possible opportunity for such a facility would create a marketable energy product, reduce residual
waste disposal volumes, and maximize the life of the landfill. Assuming that Green Technology
facility is developed by late 2015, the projected landfill capacity would last until approximately 2034.
If the Green Technology facility is not developed, the projected landfill capacity would last until
approximately 2028.

Purpose and Need
Approval of PA/ZC to EFU is needed so the existing solid waste disposal facility (which includes
the landfill and accessory facilities) will be located wholly within a farm zone. The new zoning will
allow RLC to maintain its existing facility ownership within a single zone, and will provide RLC the
opportunity to submit a subsequent Site Design Review application for a future expansion and for
an envisioned Green Technology facility onto the same tract. Ultimately, the purpose of the PA/ZC
and Conceptual Expansion Plan is to maintain, enhance, and maximize the substantial solid waste
infrastructure that already exists at this location so the landfill and associated facilities can continue
to meet the solid waste management and disposal needs of Yamhill County and the existing service
area for the next 15 to 20 years.

Safe, efficient, and cost-effective collection, transportation, and disposal of solid waste is a critical
element of the overall infrastructure needed to support existing and planned development at the
local, regional, and statewide level. Residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional users all
expect and depend on regular and convenient pickup and management of solid waste and
recyclables. Even with the strong conservation ethic and commitment to solid waste reduction,
recovery, and recycling in Oregon, landfill disposal sites that can comply with stringent
environmental regulations are needed and will continue to be needed to accommodate residual
wastes.

Riverbend Landfill                                                                               September 2013
A variety of economic, policy, and engineering reasons support future expansion of the existing
landfill over other alternatives, such as transporting solid waste to existing landfills located outside of
the County. The adopted Yamhill County Solid Waste Management Plan (SWMP) summarizes the
following needs and opportunities for solid waste disposal in the County:

           Waste prevention and recycling are important components of the County's solid waste
           management strategy. These programs are needed to conserve resources and reduce
           dependency on landfills. Even with increased participation in these efforts, however, it is
           necessary for jurisdictions to provide disposal facilities that can cost-effectively and safely
           manage waste that cannot be reused, recovered or recycled.
           Despite having one of the highest recovery rates in Oregon, the County has disposed an
           average of about 150,000 to 200,000 tons of MSW per year at the landfill from 2007 to
           2012.7
           Over the past 20 years, Riverbend Landfill has served neighboring communities in addition
           to Yamhill County. As required by the license agreement between the County and
           Riverbend, Riverbend makes regular payments to the County based on tonnages accepted at
           the landfill. This license agreement has generated a substantial and steady revenue stream to
           the County. As of 2013, Riverbend pays the County at premium rate for waste received from
           outside of the County.
The Current Permitted Area will reach capacity in about 2017. The SWMP contemplates that the
County will examine solid waste disposal options before the landfill reaches capacity. The County
began that process in 2008 with an update to the SWMP when it reviewed RLC's prior expansion
application, and the County will be positioned to conclude that process as it reviews this PA/ZC
application. RLC is initiating this PA/ZC now to provide the opportunity for future expansion to
meet County needs for solid waste disposal and avoid disruption of the well-established and highly
functional solid waste management system in the County that provides multiple public benefits.

Public Benefits
The requested PA/ZC will provide the opportunity (but not the specific land use approval) for
continued operation and phased expansion of Riverbend Landfill and would provide many benefits
to residents, businesses, and public agencies within the County. Key economic benefits are described
in the report prepared by ECONorthwest.8 These and other benefits are summarized below.

           Cost of disposal. Hauling waste to any of the three alternative disposal sites would cause
           the per-ton cost of disposal to increase for Yamhill County residents and businesses. The

Riverbend Landfill                                                                                         September 2013
           annual cost of disposal to the entire County would increase by $3.5 to $5.1 million
           (depending on the alternative site). The increased costs would be caused by the additional
           cost of managing waste at a transfer station and hauling the waste to the alternative sites.
           Revenue for Yamhill County. If Riverbend Landfill expands, RLC would continue to pay
           license fees to the County. Under a new licensing agreement approved in 2012, it is
           estimated these fees will provide more than $1.2 million in annual revenue to the County.
           That revenue supports about two-thirds of the County's Solid Waste Fund budgeted
           expenses, and pays for post-closure costs of the closed landfills, solid waste education
           programs, household hazardous collection, and other programs. If Riverbend Landfill closes,
           the County would no longer collect license fees from RLC. Instead, the County would
           collect license fees from a new transfer station, estimated to be between $64,000 and $94,000
           per year.
           Employment and income from construction. RLC will spend an estimated $25.5 million
           to expand Riverbend Landfill. The construction activity will generate 202 jobs directly
           associated with construction activities and $6.1 million in associated personal income. The
           construction activity will generate secondary jobs and income impacts, as the construction
           firms and their employees purchase goods and services in the local economy. In total,
           construction of the expansion will generate an estimated 263 jobs and $7.7 million in
           associated income. Under the alternative disposal scenarios, a $2 million transfer station will
           be constructed, creating 23 jobs directly associated with construction activities and $869,000
           in associated income.
           Employment and income from operations. Operating Riverbend currently requires 17
           full-time equivalent jobs, generating $1.6 million in associated personal income per year.
           Operating Riverbend Landfill yields secondary jobs, as RLC and its employees purchase
           goods and services in the local economy. It is estimated that operating Riverbend Landfill
           generates 19 secondary jobs and $500,000 in personal income, for a total of 36 jobs and $2.1
           million in personal income. Hauling waste to alternative sites would create between 14 and
           19 jobs, associated with operating the transfer station and transporting the waste to
           alternative sites, and would generate between $900,000 and $1.2 million in personal income
           (depending on the alternative site). Between 11 and 14 of those jobs would be directly
           employed in transfer station operations and hauling the waste.
           Electricity generation. RLC is currently generating and selling electricity to McMinnville
           Water and Light by combusting landfill gas, which is recognized by the EPA as a renewable
           energy source that offsets the need for non-renewable resources such as oil, coal and natural
           gas. The sale of landfill gas to McMinnville Water and Light allows the utility to provide their
           customers a locally generated renewable energy and also meet state renewable energy
           portfolio standards. The landfill gas from Riverbend Landfill creates a capacity of 4.8

Riverbend Landfill                                                                             September 2013
           megawatts, enough to power about 2,500 McMinnville homes. Expanding Riverbend
           Landfill would extend the electricity generation over a longer time period.
           Air emissions from hauling waste. Hauling solid waste from the County to any of the
           three alternative disposal sites generates carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx),
           carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. Expanding Riverbend Landfill avoids the
           generation of transportation-related greenhouse gases and pollutants that decrease air quality.
           The economic costs of the increased pollutant emissions are between $28,000 and $297,000
           per year for CO2; between $23,000 and $200,000 per year for NOx; and between $28,000 and
           $242,000 per year for particulate matter.
           Green Technology facility. RLC is exploring development of a Green Technology facility
           in the Future Expansion Area. One potential type of facility RLC is pursuing would generate
           a fuel source that emits less carbon than coal per British Thermal Unit (BTU) of energy
           generated and have the following economic benefits:

                Construction of the facility would generate an estimated 89 jobs directly associated with
                constructing the facility and $2.8 million in personal income. The construction activity
                and its workers would create additional jobs by purchasing local goods and services,
                creating a total of 110 temporary jobs and $3.4 million in personal income. These jobs
                and associated income would be in addition to the construction jobs and income
                referenced above.
                Operating the facility would generate an estimated 43 jobs directly associated with
                operating the facility and hauling the material to a port and $3.8 million in personal
                income, per year. The facility and its employees would generate additional jobs and
                income by purchasing local goods and services, creating a total of 88 permanent jobs and
                $5.0 million in personal income, per year.
                The facility would reduce total CO2 emissions by about 33,000 metric tons per year,
                which has an economic value between $1.3 million and $3.7 million.
           While it is Waste Management's vision to construct and operate this green technology facility
           at Riverbend Landfill, the construction of any particular facility depends on many factors
           including; proven commercialization of the technology, financial viability of the project, and
           ability to receive all necessary permits within the current regulatory structure. Approval of
           the PA/ZC will allow Riverbend to officially pursue approvals and funding from Waste
           Management.
           Stewardship Plan. More than a year ago, RLC asked landfill neighbors and community
           leaders from across the county to lead a county-wide visioning process to identify potential
           future uses and partnerships involving approximately 450 acres of "buffer land" around the
           landfill. The process has resulted in county-wide discussion about Waste Management's
           long-term future as a business and a community partner. The Stewardship Committee is on

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                                ES -8
Riverbend Landfill                                                                             September 2013
           course to recommend a final plan to Waste Management this fall. It is expected that most of
           the Stewardship Lands will continue in farm or farm-related uses that benefit communities
           throughout the County. Other community benefits expected as a result of the Stewardship
           Plan include recreation and education opportunities related to science, agriculture, geology,
           ecosystem management and history. Figure 3 identifies the Stewardship lands.

Future Permitting
As noted earlier, the County approved the PA/ZC from EFU to PWS in 1980 to allow development
of Riverbend Landfill at this location. Continued operation of the landfill and ancillary facilities
within the Current Permitted Area under the original land use approval(s) and existing DEQ permit
are not affected by this application.

RLC's ownership currently contains multiple zones (PWS, RC and EFU) that do not correspond to
specific tax lots or other easily identifiable features. Approval of the PA/ZC will provide RLC with a
single zone in which to maintain its operations. Approval of the PA/ZC to EFU will also result in
the Current Permitted Area being "wholly within a farm use zone." That change will then provide
the opportunity for RLC to submit a subsequent application for the conceptual Future Expansion
Area shown in Figure 2. The PA/ZC affects only Tax Lots 101, 200 and 401 and will require public
notice to surrounding property owners, notice to the Department of Land Conservation and
Development Commission (DLCD) and other agencies, public hearing(s) and a recommendation
from the Yamhill County Planning Commission, followed by public hearing(s) and a final decision
by the Yamhill County Board of Commissioners.

If the requested PA/ZC is approved, RLC expects to submit an application for future expansion in
accordance with Section 402.02(V) of the YCZO. The Future Expansion Area includes portions of
Tax Lots 101, 400 and 401. Any future expansion must satisfy the standards set forth in ORS
215.296(1) (a) and (b) and the standards set forth in Section 1101, Site Design Review. The ORS
215.296 standards require specific developments to demonstrate that they will not force a significant
change in accepted farm or forest practices or costs on surrounding lands devoted to farm or forest
use. The Site Design Review process addresses the compatibility of a specific development proposal
with surrounding land uses.

The future expansion of Riverbend Landfill is a large and complex project, and it is reasonable for
RLC to proceed through permitting on a phased basis to have the assurances in place regarding the
plan and zoning designations before spending substantial funds on detailed design and operational
plans for the Future Expansion Area. Figure 2 outlines the conceptual Future Expansion Area to
provide a context for this PA/ZC application. The YCZO does not require consolidation of Site
Design Review with a proposed PA/ZC and the phased permitting approach is permissible under
County and State law.

The anticipated permitting steps are outlined below.

     1. This first application for a PA/ZC from PWS and RC to EFU is required so the existing
        landfill and ancillary facilities are wholly within the farm zone to allow a subsequent land use
        application for the conceptual Future Expansion Area.
     2. Assuming County approval of the PA/ZC, RLC could then submit a Site Design Review
        application to Yamhill County for expansion of the existing facility onto contiguous tax lots
        in the same tract (portions of Tax Lots 101, 400 and 401) zoned EFU. The application
        would have to comply with the standards set forth in ORS 215.296 and the standards set
        forth in YCZO Section 1100, Site Design Review. The Site Design Review includes a two-
        step process: Preliminary Development Plan and Final Development Plan. The Site Design
        Review process could run concurrently with DEQ review and modification of Solid Waste
        Disposal Permit 345 to govern the Future Expansion Area. A Land Use Compatibility
        Statement (LUCS) would be needed from Yamhill County before DEQ could issue final
        approval of a permit modification.
     3. RLC would submit an application to DEQ to modify Solid Waste Disposal Permit 345 to
        include the Future Expansion Area, as required by ORS 459.245. The DEQ permitting
        process would require extensive and detailed technical plans and information to address
        allowable activities, operations and design, environmental monitoring, and site closure and
        financial assurances in accordance with ORS Chapter 459 and Oregon Administrative Rules
        (OAR) Chapter 340.
           RLC has coordinated with DEQ staff to share information about the conceptual Future
           Expansion Area and is confident that the expansion is "feasible" in light of adopted statues
           and administrative rules for MSW landfills and the operating history for Riverbend Landfill
           under the existing permit.
     4. The County could require documentation of DEQ approval of all plans and permits
        required under ORS 459.245 before issuing Final Development Plan approval under Site
        Design Review or any building permits for the future expansion.
     5. A Yamhill County Floodplain Development Permit may be triggered by the contemplated
        future expansion. If such a permit is necessary, the application for that permit could be
        consolidated with the Section 1100 Site Design Review application or submitted separately.
        The conceptual layout of the Future Expansion Area minimizes encroachment into the 100-
        year floodplain, and RLC believes it can document a "no rise" in the 100-year floodplain
        making it feasible to obtain a Floodplain Development Permit.
     6. Other state and federal permits or approvals may be required for the Future Expansion
        Area, and will be obtained from the applicable agencies, which may include but are not

Riverbend Landfill                                                                            September 2013
           limited to Oregon Department of State Lands (DSL), Oregon Department of Fish and
           Wildlife (ODFW), the Oregon State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), and U.S Army
           Corps of Engineers (Corps). The County may seek input from these and other agencies
           during the PA/ZC review process. Following approval of the PA/ZC, these agencies would
           be responsible for permit decisions regarding impacts from specific development proposals
           to natural and cultural resources, including wetlands and waters or endangered species. Their
           limited role during the PA/ZC process is to assist the County staff in determining whether
           particular permitting is likely feasible, based on the development proposals, and whether the
           conceptual future expansion is likely to obtain permits. The permitting coordination with
           other resource agencies will be most relevant to the Site Design Review Process and the
           review of the specific plans for the Future Expansion Area.
In summary, the proposed landfill expansion would require a number of different reviews,
approvals, and permits at different steps in the process and by different agencies. Yamhill County's
approval of the PA/ZC from PWS and RC to EFU is the threshold land use decision that must be
made before any of the related land use and permitting decisions, and is the only decision for the
County presented in this application.

I. Background
A. Historical Context
In the late 1970s, many communities throughout Oregon were facing a crisis in terms of landfill
disposal, primarily driven by changes in federal and state regulations. In 1976, Congress enacted
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to address management of municipal,
industrial, and commercial waste in an environmentally acceptable manner.

In 1979, the Oregon Legislative Assembly declared that:
       (a) The planning, location, acquisition, development, and operation of landfills are matters
           of statewide concern.
       (b) Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning for solid waste
           management.
       (c) Where the solid waste management plan of a local government unit has identified a need
           for a landfill, the state has a responsibility to assist local government and private persons
           in establishing such a site. 9

Subtitle D (promulgated by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] in 1991) is the section
of RCRA that has had the greatest impact on the design, operation, environmental monitoring,
and closure of solid waste landfills.10 Subtitle D rules for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills
took effect on October 9, 1993 and required larger facilities to install groundwater monitoring
wells, contain waste in synthetic liners, build systems to collect and manage leachate and landfill
gas, and provide sufficient funds (in advance) to close and monitor landfills for at least 30 years
after closure.

The Subtitle D rules affected disposal practices in Yamhill County (county) and throughout
Oregon. Many communities were forced to close smaller landfills because of environmental
concerns. The fact that new regulations required substantially larger investments in expanded
environmental controls meant that it was simply not cost-effective for many small communities
to continue to operate their own landfills.

Because of the new Subtitle D standards and political pressures, it was also very difficult to site
new landfills in Oregon in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As a consequence, fewer and larger
facilities now accept solid waste. In the past two decades, more than 90 landfills have closed

across Oregon, leaving a total of 32 open landfills and two incinerator/energy recovery
facilities.11

Changes in federal regulations and the shift toward larger regional facilities have substantially
affected disposal practices in the County. The Newberg and Whiteson landfills both operated
until the early 1980s when they reached capacity. Riverbend Landfill began operating in 1982
just as these landfills closed and has since served as the primary disposal facility in the County.

As smaller landfills in the Willamette Valley and neighboring counties closed, Riverbend Landfill
Company, Inc. (RLC) and other landfill operators made significant investments to meet the
more stringent federal requirements and serve as regional landfills to provide disposal services to
other communities. As defined in Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) 459.005(22) a "regional
disposal site" is a disposal site that receives, or a proposed disposal site that is designed to
receive, more than 75,000 tons of solid waste a year from outside the immediate service area in
which the disposal site is located. Riverbend Landfill has been categorized as a regional landfill
since 1996.

Riverbend Landfill serves Yamhill, Clatsop, Lincoln, and Columbia Counties, as well as portions
of the Metro area. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality's (DEQ's) list of active
permitted facilities sorted by permit class and type identifies six MSW landfills as regional
landfills in Oregon (Table 3).

B. Previous Land Use Approvals for Riverbend Landfill
In 1979, the Yamhill County Commissioners determined that the two MSW landfills that were
operating within the County would soon reach capacity. Whiteson Landfill, owned by the
County, was receiving waste from south central Yamhill County. Newberg Landfill was receiving
waste from eastern Yamhill County and southern Washington County.

The County issued a request for proposals from the private sector to enter into a disposal
franchise to develop and operate a new landfill. On December 19, 1979, the predecessor of RLC
submitted a proposal for development of a new landfill in the County in anticipation of closure
of Whiteson Landfill and Newberg Landfill.

On January 23, 1980, the Yamhill County Solid Waste Advisory Committee (SWAC) held a
hearing to consider the applications received for solid waste disposal franchises and the siting of
a new landfill. A proposal for the development of Riverbend Landfill was reviewed, including
the need for a comprehensive plan amendment and zone change from the Exclusive Farm Use
(EFU) zone to the Public Works/Safety (PWS) zone. Following the public hearing, the SWAC
recommended that the Board approve the plan amendment and zone change for the proposed
landfill and grant a disposal franchise to RLC's predecessor.

In 1980, the County approved a Goal 3 Exception allowing a comprehensive plan amendment
and zone change from EFU to PWS for the development of Riverbend Landfill (Ordinances
236 and 237, May 14, 1980). At that time, although solid waste disposal sites were permissible
uses in an EFU zone under state law, the County's 1976 zoning ordinance allowed landfills as an
outright permitted use only in the PWS zoning district, necessitating the Goal 3 Exception and
zone change.

In 1994, RLC entered into a twenty-year license agreement with the County, as required by
County Ordinance 578. By entering into that agreement, RLC guaranteed disposal capacity for
County-generated solid waste until the year 2014. At the same time, the County acknowledged
that RLC would operate Riverbend Landfill as a regional landfill, serving Yamhill County and
neighboring counties and utilizing out-of-county waste as a means to reduce and stabilize
disposal rates for the County's residential, commercial and industrial generators of solid waste.
This arrangement became a central component of the County's Solid Waste Management Plan
(SWMP), which was updated in 2004 and more recently in 2008.

The license agreement between the County and RLC was scheduled to expire in 2014, at which
time Riverbend Landfill was also expected to reach its maximum permitted capacity.

As demonstrated by the historical context, and as reflected in the County's Solid Waste
Management Plan, local disposal options for municipal solid waste have been a long-standing
Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                        Page 3
Riverbend Landfill                                                                      September 2013
and important component of the County's infrastructure. The County has always been able to
provide for the continued presence of such facilities through the Yamhill County Zoning
Ordinance (YCZO), either as a permitted use in the existing PWS Zone, or by converting EFU
land to PWS through the rigorous Goal Exception12 process that allows the conversion of
farmland for non-farm uses where sufficient reasons exist to justify such a use.

In 2008, in anticipation of reaching full capacity and approaching the end of its license
agreement, RLC submitted a land use application to allow expansion of Riverbend Landfill to
accommodate the County's solid waste disposal needs for an additional twenty to thirty years. At
the time of that land use application, solid waste disposal facilities remained an allowable use in
an EFU zone pursuant to ORS 215.283(2)(k). The YCZO, however, continued to allow
municipal solid waste disposal by right only in the PWS zone. Part of RLC's application
therefore included another request under Goal 2 to grant a Goal 3 Exception that would allow
the net conversion of 25 acres of EFU-zoned land to the PWS zone.

During the course of the County's review of RLC's 2008 application, the County updated its
SWMP. That update include the County's hiring of a consultant to analyze various disposal
options in the event Riverbend Landfill ceased operating in 2014 (JR Miller Report). The
updated SWMP primarily compared the continued operation of Riverbend Landfill to other
landfill alternatives located outside the county, and predicted a county-wide increase to
ratepayers if Riverbend Landfill closed.

Because the JR Miller Report only briefly addressed the availability of alternative technologies,
and due to conflicting testimony regarding landfill alternatives in areas outside the County, the
Board commissioned a second report to address in greater detail all alternatives to a local landfill
(Zia Report). The Zia Report first analyzed alternatives involving the export of waste to an out-
of-County local or regional landfill in Oregon or Washington. The Zia Report then analyzed
alternative technologies including non-landfill biological, chemical, and thermal waste
conversion technologies.

With respect to landfill alternatives, the Zia Report confirmed the findings in the JR Miller
Report and concluded that long-haul trucking of the County's waste to other landfills would all
be more expensive than using a local landfill considering the need to develop transfer capacity
and the distance of transport involved.

With respect to non-landfill alternatives, the Zia Report concluded that only one technology,
waste-to-energy, is operating at a fully-commercial level and is capable of handling the broad

municipal solid waste stream. However, the Zia Report stated that the only existing waste-to-
energy facility in Oregon does not have the capacity to process the County's waste.

Based in part on the information developed through the update of the SWMP and the record in
RLC's 2008 application, the Board found that continued operation of a local landfill was
necessary to meet the County's solid waste disposal needs and approved RLC's expansion
application, including the requested exception to Statewide Planning Goal 3 (Agricultural Lands).

The County's decision approving the Goal Exception and expansion of Riverbend Landfill was
appealed to the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA). LUBA reversed the County's decision
through its Final Order in LUBA No. 2010-002. In doing so, LUBA confirmed that the County
had allowed a Goal Exception to rezone property for use as a landfill, a use that is allowed by
Goal 3 pursuant to ORS 215.283(2)(k). According to LUBA, reversal was necessary because a
county cannot approve a Goal 3 Exception to allow a use that is allowed by Goal 3 and the
statutory EFU zone. Instead, LUBA stated, "[i]f the county wishes to allow landfills on
agricultural land, it must amend its EFU zone to allow them under the standards set forth in the
statutory EFU zone, with any supplementary regulation that the County wishes to adopt." On
review, the Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed LUBA's decision.13

The result of LUBA's reversal of the County's decision was that the County could not use the
Goal Exception process to review on a case-by-case basis the siting or expansion of a landfill
and converting EFU land to PWS as it did in 1980, 2002 and 2009. Instead, if it wished to
consider future applications relating to solid waste facilities in the EFU zone, the County must
amend its EFU zone to allow solid waste facilities and then consider any specific applications
made under the amended language based on the standards set forth in the statutory EFU Zone
and any supplemental regulation that the County imposes.

On June 2, 2011, the Board initiated a textual change to the County's EFU zone to allow solid
waste facilities to be maintained, enhanced or expanded within the EFU zone in some
circumstances (the "legislative amendment"). The language of the legislative amendment
proposed by County Planning Staff made the following addition to YCZO 402.02:

           V.      The maintenance, expansion or enhancement of an existing site
           on the same tract for the disposal of solid waste for which a permit has
           been granted under ORS 459.245 by the Department of Environmental
           Quality, together with equipment, facilities or buildings necessary for its
           operation. The use must satisfy the standards set forth in ORS
           215.296(1)(a) and (b) and the standards set forth in Section 1101, Site

Riverbend Landfill                                                                       September 2013
           Design Review. The maintenance, expansion or enhancement of an
           existing use on the same tract on high-value farmland is permissible only
           if the existing use is wholly with a farm use zone. No other Yamhill
           County Zoning Ordinance criteria or Comprehensive Plan goal or policy
           shall apply as an approval standard for this use.

After a public hearing and review by the Planning Commission, and upon reviewing the record
in this matter, the Board determined that it was in the best interest of the citizens of Yamhill
County to adopt the legislative amendment (Ordinance 867, September 22, 2011). The County's
decision approving the legislative amendment was appealed to LUBA. LUBA affirmed the
County's decision through its Final Order in LUBA No. 2011-091.

This land use and legal history provides the context for this application. RLC is requesting a plan
amendment and zone change to "vacate" the Goal Exception(s) and PWS and Recreational
Commercial (RC) zoning approved by the County and revert to the original EFU zoning. The
existing use (landfill and ancillary facilities) will then be wholly within a farm use zone and RLC
will have the opportunity to apply for an expansion on the same tract on high-value farmland
under the provisions of YCZO 402.02(V).

C. Description of Existing Solid Waste Management System in Yamhill County
The solid waste management system in the County consists of collection, transfer, waste
recovery, recycling, composting and disposal facilities and services. The system is operated by
private companies that hold franchise agreements with the County and/or cities within the
County. The following description of components of the existing solid waste management
system is largely based on information in the Yamhill County SWMP.

1. Refuse Collection
Two private companies provide collection of MSW from residences and commercial
establishments in the County: Recology - Western Oregon and Waste Management (WM). These
companies are franchised by the County and municipalities in the County to provide garbage
and recycling collection throughout the County under authority granted by ORS 459.086 and the
Yamhill County Solid Waste Collection and Disposal Ordinance 578.

Franchise agreements grant each company the exclusive right to collect solid waste and
recyclables from a specified area. Waste haulers are obligated to provide a regular schedule for
collection of garbage in all areas of the County and recyclables in urbanized areas. Refuse
collection rates are regulated by cities and by the County under terms of the franchise
agreements.

Riverbend Landfill                                                                      September 2013
Solid waste collected by Recology - Western Oregon is hauled directly to Riverbend Landfill.
Recology provides service to the western and northern area of the County, including the cities of
Amity, Carlton, Dayton, Lafayette, McMinnville, Sheridan, Willamina, and Yamhill. Recology
serves other valley and north coast communities in Clatsop, Tillamook and Polk Counties.
Recology also operates a composting facility for yard debris in McMinnville (NW Greenlands
Landscape Supply) under a DEQ Site Composting Permit.

WM provides collection service to the east side of the County, including the cities of Newberg
and Dundee. WM collects solid waste and hauls it to its transfer station in Newberg, where
increasing amounts of dry waste are being sorted and diverted from the landfill. WM diverts
approximately 100 tons of dry waste (debris from construction and demolition) per year as a
result of renovations at the company's transfer station in Newberg. Dry waste is diverted to
WM's Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) in Hillsboro, OR. Residual waste (non-recoverable
waste) is hauled to Riverbend Landfill or WM's landfill at Hillsboro for disposal.

2. Recycling Services
Recology - Western Oregon and WM currently collect recyclable materials within the boundaries
of the 10 incorporated cities and unincorporated County areas where they are franchised.
Recycling drop-off depots are available for residents living in unincorporated County areas. In
addition to recycling services provided by the franchised haulers, there are many private firms
and volunteer organizations that advance efforts to reduce, reuse, recover and recycle materials.

RLC has completed final engineering plans and obtained Site Design Review approval for
substantial upgrades to the entrance facilities at Riverbend Landfill, including a public drop area
and expanded recycling area. These facility improvements will be constructed in 2014 and will
improve safety by separating public and commercial vehicles at the landfill. The new recycling
center will expand opportunities to reduce waste, recycle more materials, and divert more
material from the landfill.

3. Transfer Station
The Newberg Transfer and Recycling Center is the only transfer station operating in the County.
The facility operates under an exclusive franchise from the County. WM completed a $1.4
million upgrade of the transfer station in 2011. The upgrades make using the transfer station
faster and more efficient and allow for diverting dry waste from the landfill and extracting more
value from the waste stream. Municipal solid waste received at the transfer station is transferred
in waste transfer trailers to Riverbend Landfill. Recyclables brought to the transfer station are
separated and sent directly to market.

4. Disposal Facilities ­ MSW Landfill
There are different types of landfill facilities that are designed and permitted to handle different
waste streams. The primary type of landfill is one that is designed to dispose of MSW. Riverbend
Landfill is the only disposal facility permitted to accept MSW in the County. Riverbend Landfill
receives MSW (household or residential wastes) as well as commercial/institutional wastes,
construction and demolition waste, and non-hazardous "special waste". Riverbend Landfill is a
modern landfill designed and engineered with overlapping environmental protection systems
that meet or exceed rigorous state and federal regulations and are subject to highly regulated
monitoring and reporting requirements. The landfill has a double liner, geo-membrane system to
contain and isolate the waste and leachate, thereby protecting soil and groundwater. It also has
state-of-the-art systems to collect and manage landfill gas and leachate. Other environmental
controls include storm water conveyance and routing and an extensive network of groundwater
monitoring wells.

DEQ maintains a comprehensive web page that provides a detailed summary of Riverbend
Landfill permits and links to numerous plans, documents, drawings and specifications,
monitoring reports and information on other issues pertinent to Riverbend Landfill.14 RLC
understands that DEQ will update and maintain this web page on an on-going basis to provide
broad public access to permit and technical information relating to Riverbend Landfill.
Topics/headings from the web page are highlighted on the following page to provide an
overview of the type of technical information that is readily available to the public.

5. Other Disposal Facilities
In addition to Riverbend Landfill and Newberg Transfer Station, other existing facilities in
Yamhill County with DEQ Solid Waste facility permits include: 1) Recology-Western Oregon's
Recovery Zone public recycling drop-off facility in McMinnville; 2) Recology's NW Greenlands
yard debris/composting facility in McMinnville; 3) Buck Hollow Industrial/wood facility in
Willamina; and 4) four composting sites in EFU zoned areas registered under DEQ 2009 Rules.

Appendix 2 includes DEQ permit information and zoning maps for these other disposal
facilities.

This section of the application narrative provides a brief overview of land characteristics and
existing uses in the vicinity of Riverbend Landfill. The summary of site conditions describes
existing uses and land characteristics more specifically for the zone change and Future
Expansion Area.

RLC owns a total of approximately 705 acres in the vicinity of Riverbend Landfill, including
parcels to both sides of Highway 18 (see Figure 4). Table 4 identifies the parcels by tax lot
number, size, and existing and proposed zoning. Only the three tax parcels that are shaded in
Table 4, which each contain split zoning, are included in the PA/ZC.

A. Vicinity Characteristics
1. Location & Land Capabilities
Riverbend Landfill is located in unincorporated Yamhill County about 2 miles south of the
McMinnville Urban Growth Boundary (UGB). Oregon Route 18 (Highway 18) traverses the
area and provides an expressway connection to Highway 99W and is an important transportation
link between the Portland metro area and the Oregon coast.

Topography in the general vicinity is relatively gentle, with productive agricultural fields in the
level valley lands abutting Highway 18, transitioning up to hills and mixed agricultural and
woodlands to the northwest, and down to the Yamhill River floodplain to the southeast.
Elevations range from about 700 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) in the hillside areas, down to about
150 feet MSL adjacent to Highway 18 and decreasing to about 100 feet MSL along the South
Yamhill River.

The County's prosperous agricultural sector benefits from fertile soils, historic availability of
water for irrigation, and a favorable climate. Forested lands comprise over half the County land
area and provide jobs, clean water, and habitat for many plants and animals. Natural resource-
based industries provide a large percentage of total business revenues for the County.

As shown in Figure 5, the predominant soils on the broad valley terraces in the vicinity include
Amity silt loam (Am) and Woodburn silt loam (WuB). Most of the acreage is cultivated and the
general capability unit is Class II. Major crops include grass seed, grains, hazelnut and walnut
orchards, and vegetables. Grape vineyards, Christmas tree farms, and nursery stock are also
grown nearby. Some of the pastures support small livestock operations, including sheep. With
the exception of small areas of Class IV soils associated with creeks and steeper slopes, soils in
the project vicinity are categorized as high value farm lands.

According to statistics released by Oregon State University (OSU) and summarized by the
Oregon Department of Agriculture,15 the County ranked ninth out of the 36 Oregon counties in
terms of 2012 gross agricultural sales. The list of the top 10 counties includes the following:

       1. Marion County                         $639 million
       2. Umatilla County                       $487 million
       3. Morrow County                         $482 million
       4. Malheur County                        $373 million
       5. Clackamas County                      $343 million

The northern Willamette Valley continues to be a hub of nursery activity. After some tough
times due to the U.S. recession and slump in housing and construction, Oregon's greenhouse
and nursery sector has rebounded a bit, helping Yamhill County see increases in agricultural sales
in 2012. In Yamhill County, nursery crops rank #1 in total agricultural commodity sales for the
County in 2012.16 Sales by commodity are shown in Table 5.

While there are farm residences located in the vicinity of Riverbend Landfill, the overall
residential density is very low because of EFU zoning restrictions and the closest dwelling (that
is not owned by RLC) is located about 900 feet from the existing landfill. The majority of the
dwellings within the vicinity are located on smaller parcels along McCabe Road and Delashmutt
Lane. In addition to the farm dwellings and farm buildings, other existing land uses in the
vicinity include an RV park, the closed Whiteson Landfill, a church, cemetery, Yamhill Valley
Heritage Center, cell tower, and farm stands.

2. Existing Plan & Zoning Designations
The Yamhill County Comprehensive Plan (Plan) and Zoning Map designate the majority of
lands within the vicinity of Riverbend Landfill as EFU. Zoning transitions to AF-10 in the
hillside areas west of McCabe Road. The church and cemetery sites to the west side of McCabe
Road are zoned Public Assembly/Institutional (PAI).

Non-agricultural designations are clustered in the vicinity of the landfill (see Figure 4), including
the following:

            Parks/Recreation/Open Space (PRO) zoning of County-owned Monroe Landing
            adjacent to the closed landfill
            RC zoning of Mulkey recreational vehicle (RV) park
3. Natural Resources
The project vicinity drains to the South Yamhill River, which flows into the Willamette River
east of Dayton. Water levels vary seasonally with high winter stream flows and low summer
flows. Oregon Water Resources Department has appropriated water rights for 8,300 acre-feet of
water in the Yamhill Basin, with 6,423 acre-feet used for irrigation and the rest primarily for
urban uses. In some communities, municipal water use is in direct competition with agricultural
uses. Irrigation withdrawals occur primarily during summer months when stream flows are low
and can negatively influence water quality.17

The diversity and acreage of natural wildlife habitats in the County have been reduced as land
has been converted from natural forest and grassland to managed forests, cropland, home sites,
and urban areas. An estimated 40 percent of Willamette Valley wetlands have been lost. As a
result, the following ecological functions of wetlands and riparian areas have also diminished
over time: (1) filtering sediment, (2) providing wildlife habitat, (3) regulating high water flows, (4)
replenishing groundwater, and (5) providing greater in-stream water flows during summer
months.

In general, the creeks and drainages to the upstream side of Highway 18 have been straightened
to accommodate agriculture. The natural resources associated with the South Yamhill River to
the south side of Highway 18 are more substantial, with a meandering river corridor and a much
more extensive riparian and wooded corridor adjacent to the river in many areas.

4. Transportation Facilities
The dominant feature of the road network in the County is the Highway 99W-18 major arterial
crossing the County. It serves local and intercity traffic, commuter traffic oriented to the
Portland metropolitan area, and tourist and weekend vacation traffic between Portland and the
Coast, as well as providing direct access to abutting properties throughout much of its length.

In the immediate vicinity of the landfill, Highway 18 is a rural, two-lane highway, with 8-foot
paved shoulders bordered by 4- to 6-foot gravel shoulders. The posted speed limit in the project

area is 55 miles per hour. Historical annual average daily traffic (ADT) on Highway 18 at
milepost 41.0 peaked in 2006 with about 14,300 ADT and decreased over the next years to
about 13,100 ADT in 2011. Highway 18 experiences a seasonal fluctuation in traffic flow since it
is a primary route to the Oregon coast. The peak traffic month is August with traffic volumes 18
percent higher than the average of all months.18

Traffic volumes are fairly low on the County road system as it primarily serves rural areas. Major
paved County roads to the northwest side of Highway 18 in the general vicinity include
Masonville Road, McCabe Chapel Road, and Oldsville Road. There is less connectivity of
County roads to the southwest side of Highway 18 in the general vicinity of Riverbend Landfill
because there are limited bridge crossings of the South Yamhill River. Delashmutt Road
provides an important County road connection to Bellevue Highway 153 that links to the City of
Amity and Highway 99W.

5. Facilities and Services
Because the project vicinity includes land in the rural area and outside of incorporated cities,
urban sanitary sewer and water services are not available. Farm dwellings and other rural uses
depend on onsite septic systems and onsite wells. Electricity and telecommunication services are
generally provided via an overhead pole system along the state highways and major County
roads. The Yamhill County Sheriff and Rural Fire Districts provide police and fire protection
services to the rural areas, with intergovernmental agreements in place with city fire and police
agencies for backup services.

B. Zone Change Area and Future Expansion Area
The combined zone change area and Future Expansion Area (Figure 1) is bordered by Highway
18 to the west, agricultural land and riparian forest to the north, the South Yamhill River to the
east and south, and agricultural land to the southwest. RLC owns additional land in the
immediate vicinity of the landfill, including parcels south of the South Yamhill River and parcels
west of Highway 18 (Figure 4). The description of site characteristics in this section focuses on
the three tax parcels included in the zone change area (Tax Lots 101, 200 and 401) and the
additional parcel included in the Future Expansion Area (Tax Lot 400).

1. Location & Land Capability
Topography in the analysis area slopes gently to the southeast and includes some artificial and
natural hills associated with Riverbend Landfill and the leachate storage pond. Elevations range

Figure 5 shows soil value information for the analysis area, based on Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) data (2012). Portions of the analysis area are developed, with the
most intensive development concentrated in the existing landfill permit area (approximately 87
acres in the northwest quadrant of Tax Lot 200), and at the entrance facilities (approximately 7
acres in the westerly corner of Tax Lot 101). Other portions of the analysis area are undeveloped
including the floodway/floodplain areas near the South Yamhill River (southerly half of Tax Lot
200), and mowed fields (Tax Lot 400).

2. Existing Land Uses
Existing and approved land uses for each of the parcels included in the zone change area (Tax
Lots 101, 200 and 401) and Future Expansion Area (Tax Lots 101, 400 and 401) are summarized

PWS designation for the westerly a portion of TL 101 was approved in 2002 with Yamhill
County adoption of Ordinance 718. The RC designation for a portion of TL 401 was approved
in 1975 when the County approved Plan Amendment (PA) 13-75 for a motorcycle racing track.
The County took a "built and committed" exception for the RV park on TL 401 when the
County's Plan was adopted in 1979.20

4. Natural Resources

Wetlands and Water Resources
The South Yamhill River flows along the southern boundary of the analysis area in an easterly
direction toward its confluence with the Yamhill River approximately 10 miles to the east. One
unnamed perennial stream parallels the northern boundary of Tax Lot 101 and a second
unnamed perennial stream crosses under Highway 18 and across Tax Lots 400 and 401. Both
streams flow in an easterly direction to the South Yamhill River.

RLC has delineated wetlands within the analysis area and has received Department of State
Lands (DSL) concurrence of the delineations. The concurrence identifies all jurisdictional
wetlands and other "Waters of the State" and/or "Waters of the United States" in the analysis
area.

Riverbend Landfill is located near the bottom of the Lower South Yamhill-Deer Creek
watershed, with much of its flow originating from several other upstream watersheds, significant
portions of which lie in other counties. Waters passing Riverbend Landfill have been collected
from an area nearly 250,000 acres in size. Land uses within that watershed are generally
composed of forestry and farming, as well as several cities.

All of these watersheds have water quality challenges, including high temperature, fecal coliform,
and phosphorus. According to DEQ, "about 70 to 80 percent of pollution enters the river via
nonpoint sources, particularly from agricultural activity."21

Riverbend Landfill's surface water discharges are regulated as point sources governed by a set of
compliance standards and regularly monitored against a set of benchmarks. To protect the river,
RLC takes an active role in controlling surface water discharges. RLC also manages and plans to
enhance riparian areas to restore ecosystem functions that improve water quality.

Wildlife Habitat
Existing wildlife habitat types in the analysis area are described in the Riverbend Landfill Wildlife
Management Plan22 and include 1) lowland conifer-hardwood forest, 2) agriculture, 3) grassland,
4) open water, 5) riparian-wetlands, and 6) herbaceous wetland. The Riverbend Landfill property
received Wildlife at Work certification from the Wildlife Habitat Council in 2005. In 2007 and
2009, the site was recertified based on the efforts of Riverbend Landfill to maintain and expand
wildlife habitat, including installing bird boxes and raptor platforms and removing invasive plant
species.

5. Transportation Facilities
The analysis area has approximately 4,600 feet of frontage on Highway 18, a statewide roadway
under the jurisdiction of the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT). The existing
entrance to Riverbend Landfill is located at milepost 41.56 and serves only Riverbend Landfill.
The primary access to the site would remain at the current location.

The intersection of Highway 18 at the site access is a three-legged intersection controlled by a
STOP sign on the access approach. The southwest bound approach has a through lane and a
dedicated left-turn lane, whereas the northbound approach has a through lane and a dedicated
right-turn lane. The site access has a shared lane for all turning movements that is wide enough
to accommodate a right and left-turning vehicle simultaneously.23

Traffic counts were conducted at the intersection of Highway 18 and the property access on
Thursday, July 11th, 2013, from 4:00 AM to 5:00 PM and on Saturday, July 13th, 2013, from 6:00
AM to 4:00 PM. The times observed corresponded with the operating hours of Riverbend
Landfill. Using these counts, the morning peak hour was found to occur from 7:00 AM to 8:00
AM and the evening peak hour was found to occur from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM (See Attachment
B).

6. Facilities and Services
Riverbend Landfill is located outside of established urban growth boundaries and city
boundaries. Existing facilities and services available to the project site include:

            Overhead power and telephone services via poles along Highway 18
            A groundwater well providing drinking water to the office
            A water intake on the South Yamhill River, which is connected to a water storage tank
            that provides water for fire protection and dust suppression

In addition, the Riverbend Landfill operation is supported by a range of ancillary support and
environmental monitoring facilities, including but not limited to groundwater monitoring wells,
landfill gas monitoring probes, landfill gas flare, a leachate storage pond, and an irrigation system
for the poplar tree orchard.

The Yamhill County Sheriff provides police protection services to the area. A manufactured
home located on the project site is available for occupancy by RLC employees to provide
additional on-site security.

The McMinnville Fire District provides fire protection services to Riverbend Landfill. A water
intake at the South Yamhill River is used to maintain an on-site water supply in the 25,000 gallon
storage tank. A water truck and other heavy equipment and machinery are readily available and
RLC employees are trained to respond to fires at Riverbend Landfill. The gas flare system is tied
into a security monitoring system and alarms are activated if there are any malfunctions in the
system.

III.Compliance with Statewide Planning Goals
An amendment to the Comprehensive Plan Map must demonstrate compliance with applicable
Statewide Planning Goals. Because Oregon's planning framework is based on local
comprehensive plans that implement the statewide planning goals, there is quite a bit of overlap
between goals and policies articulated in the Plan and the more general statements in the
statewide planning goals. Statewide Planning Goals 1 through 15 and any other related excerpts
or implementing rule language are presented in italic type below, followed by responses that
describe why the proposed plan map amendment from PWS and RC to EFU complies with
these statewide planning goals.

A. Goal 1 - Citizen Involvement
     To develop a citizen involvement program that insures the opportunity for citizens to be
     involved in all phases of the planning process.

Response: Goal 1 requires that local governments provide citizens with opportunities to
participate in several phases of land use planning, ranging from broad scale public involvement
in the development of comprehensive plans and implementing ordinances to more site-specific
review of plan and development proposals. Generally, Goal 1 is satisfied when a local
government follows the public involvement procedures set out in its acknowledged
comprehensive plan and land use regulations.

The County's regulations for comprehensive plan amendments include notice to surrounding
property owners and to DLCD, and public hearings before the Yamhill County Planning
Commission and the Yamhill County Board of Commissioners (which makes final decisions on
all plan amendments). Opportunities for citizen input and written and oral testimony on the
PA/ZC will be provided at public hearings.

1. Community Meetings
RLC is committed to listening to and understanding neighbor's concerns and addressing them as
best they can. RLC hosted 17 community meetings in 2012-13. RLC invited the public to every
community meeting with newspaper ads and community calendar notices. By email, Riverbend
invited neighbors, others who have expressed interest in Riverbend operations, and elected
officials and community leaders from across the county. Neighbors and other meeting attendees
identified meeting topics, and every meeting included time set aside for feedback and discussion
about topics of the audience's choice. Agenda topics included reducing operating hours to be a
better neighbor, how and why we monitor groundwater, expanding and improving the landfill
gas management, why Riverbend and most modern landfills are regional landfills, floodplain
issues, economic benefits connected to Riverbend, using falcons to manage seagull and starling

Riverbend Landfill                                                                          September 2013
populations, green technologies that use waste as a resource, and "What do you want in a new
recycling center?"

RLC has listened and responded to community input by: 1) changing operating hours in direct
response to feedback from neighbors; 2) establishing a community comment line available 24/7
for reporting issues related to Riverbend operations; 3) implementing new diversion strategies to
reduce the amount of waste going to the landfill; 4) signing a new licensing agreement that pays
the county considerably more for out-of-county waste; 5) implementing a new falcon program to
help manage birds at the landfill; and 6) strengthening operational expertise with the addition of
new staff members at Riverbend.

2. Briefings for City Councils
RLC has briefed elected officials representing every city in the County about ongoing operations,
future plans, and RLC's work to be a good neighbor and community partner.

3. Briefings and tours for SWAC, YC Master Recyclers, Students, EQC, Metro, Media
RLC has repeatedly demonstrated a commitment to transparency and open dialogue by initiating
briefings and tours for key groups and the media. In 2012-13, these groups included the Yamhill
County Solid Waste Advisory Committee, Yamhill County Master Recyclers, Leadership
McMinnville, Leadership Newberg, the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission, the Metro
Council, and media from McMinnville, Newberg and Portland. In 2012-13, RLC also hosted
tours for more than 300 students from McMinnville middle schools and high schools and
colleges located in the county.

4. WM Stewardship Plan
Listening opportunities during community meetings helped the RLC leadership team understand
the need for Riverbend to be a better community partner. Discussions with Yamhill County
Commissioners helped shape a community partnership idea that has since touched thousands of
Yamhill County residents and has the potential to deliver tangible benefits to schools,
community groups and individuals throughout the county for decades to come.

RLC initiated the project in 2012 by inviting Riverbend neighbors and community leaders to
serve on the WM Stewardship Committee. The Committee's role was to lead a county-wide
conversation to determine how 450 acres of Waste Management property will be used to benefit
the community. Each city in Yamhill County is represented on the Committee, and many
members are actively involved in education, agriculture, viticulture, youth programs, recreation,
and wildlife, as well as the preservation and sharing of local history.

The 450 acres is land that WM bought to provide buffer for landfill operations, much like a
manufacturer buys buffer property around an industrial plant. The land is now home to
orchards, open meadows, and farming.

After a series of public meetings and 10 presentations to service groups throughout the county,
the Stewardship Committee is now finalizing the Stewardship Plan for recommendation to
Waste Management and implementation over the next 10 to 20 years.

Ideas in the draft plan include a leadership and agriculture education center for the Oregon
Future Farmers of America, a community farming collaborative, a trail system with both hiking
trails and water trails, and commercial farming.

5. Summary of Citizen Involvement
In summary, RLC has gone beyond the basic citizen involvement efforts required by Goal 1
before submitting the land use application and anticipates ongoing public input and continuing
community dialogue throughout the public hearing process and on an on-going basis. RLC
understands and expects that there will be substantial community interest in the requested
PA/ZC and extensive testimony at the public hearings, and the County's review process will
provide yet another venue for that discussion.

B. Goal 2 ­ Land Use Planning
     To establish a land use planning process and policy framework as a basis for all decisions
     and actions related to use of land and to assure an adequate factual base for such decisions
     and actions.

1. Part I - Planning
Response: Goal 2, Part I requires that actions related to land use be consistent with
acknowledged comprehensive plans of cities and counties. Consistency of the proposed PA/ZC
with goals and policies in the acknowledged Plan is addressed in Section IV of this narrative.

Riverbend Landfill is located in a rural area and the County has land use jurisdiction over the
PA/ZC request. Additionally, under state law counties are assigned the lead role in coordinating
planning for solid waste management and each city generally defers to the County's role. While
the comprehensive plans of the 10 incorporated cities in the County are not directly applicable
to the proposed PA/ZC, the comprehensive plans of the cities generally include a reference or
policy supporting coordination with the County on matters related to solid waste.

Each city in the County has a franchise agreement in place with Recology-Western Oregon or
WM to collect solid waste and recyclables within defined service areas. As described in Section I,
the solid waste collection system for the urban areas is integrally tied with and dependent on the

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                            Page 21
Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
availability of Riverbend Landfill for disposal of residual wastes. In addition to the policy
framework provided by the County's acknowledged Comprehensive Plan, the adopted SWMP
provides additional policies and facts that provide context for RLC's proposal.

Goal 2 also requires coordination with affected governments and agencies, evaluation of
alternatives, and an adequate factual base. In developing the concept for the Future Expansion
Area, RLC has engaged in significant coordination efforts over several years to provide
background information on the proposal to local government officials and the community. The
scope of the conceptual future expansion has been substantially refined and reduced relative to
the 2008 expansion proposal. RLC has coordinated with representatives of Yamhill County, the
10 incorporated cities in the County, DEQ's Solid Waste Division, and ODOT.

Moreover, the County typically sends referrals to numerous agencies to obtain comment from
those agencies on proposed plan amendments and zone changes. For the 2008 RLC application,
this included notice to ODOT, ODFW, DSL, DEQ, DLCD, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries, Soil & Water Conservation District,
Department of Agriculture, Watermaster, FEMA, Metro Solid Waste Division and the ten cities
in Yamhill County.

The PA/ZC application includes documents and factual evidence in support of the PA/ZC,
including but not limited to economic, traffic and environmental studies prepared by firms with
specialized technical expertise in these areas. For these reasons, Goal 2, Part I is met.

2. Part II ­ Exceptions
Response: Goal 2, Part II sets out the standards for goal exceptions. As described in the
Background Section (Section I), the 2008 application for a proposed expansion of Riverbend
Landfill included an exception to Goal 3 (Agricultural Lands). The County's decision approving
the Goal exception and expansion of Riverbend Landfill was appealed to the LUBA. LUBA
reversed the County's decision and that decision was sustained by the Court of Appeals.
According to LUBA, reversal was necessary because a county cannot approve a Goal 3
exception to allow a use that is allowed by Goal 3 and the statutory EFU zone.

The result of LUBA's reversal of the County's decision was that the County could not use the
goal exception process to review on a case-by-case basis the siting or expansion of a landfill and
converting EFU land to PWS as it did in 1980, 2002 and 2009. For these reasons, the Goal 2,
Part II Exception Process is not applicable to this PA/ZC application.

Riverbend Landfill                                                                      September 2013
C. Goal 3 ­ Agricultural Lands
     To preserve and maintain agricultural lands.

Response: Goal 3 requires that "agricultural lands shall be preserved and maintained for farm
use***". Goal 3 also expressly states "counties may authorize farm uses and those non-farm uses
defined by (Land Conservation and Development Commission [LCDC]) rule that will not have
significant adverse effects on accepted farm or forest practices." Solid waste disposal facilities
are among the non-farm uses authorized by statute and commission rule, if they will not have
significant adverse effects on accepted farm or forest practices. Goal 3 is unique among the
nineteen statewide planning goals in that it both identifies a resource for protection (agricultural
land) and specifies the detailed regulatory mechanism that must be adopted to ensure such
protection (the EFU zone that is set out in statute and refined by LCDC rule).

Under ORS 215.283(2), the following nonfarm use may be established, subject to the approval
of the governing body or its designee, in any area zoned for EFU subject to ORS 215.296:

     (k) A site for the disposal of solid waste approved by the governing body of a city or county
         or both and for which a permit has been granted under ORS 459.245 by the Department
         of Environmental Quality together with equipment, facilities or buildings necessary for
         its operation.
Under ORS 215.296, a use authorized under ORS 215.283(2) may be approved only where the
local governing body or its designee finds that the use would not:

     (a) Force a significant change in accepted farm or forest practices on surrounding lands
         devoted to farm or forest use; or
     (b) Significantly increase the cost of accepted farm or forest practices on surrounding lands
         devoted to farm or forest use.

OAR 660-033-0130(18) provides additional guidance for solid waste disposal sites on high-value
farmland:

     Existing solid waste disposal sites wholly within a farm use zone may be maintained,
     enhanced, or expanded on the same tract, subject to other requirements of the law.

In 1980, the County approved a PA/ZC from EFU to PWS to allow development of Riverbend
Landfill. At that time, although solid waste disposal sites were permissible uses in an EFU zone
under that law, the County's 1976 zoning ordinance allowed landfills as an outright permitted
use only in the PWS zoning district, necessitating the zone change.

In 2008, when RLC submitted an application to expand Riverbend Landfill, the County still only
permitted landfills in the PWS zone. After the County approved a PA/ZC to PWS, including an


Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                           Page 23
Riverbend Landfill                                                                          September 2013
exception to Goal 3, LUBA reversed the decision and that reversal was upheld by the Court of
Appeals.

Responding to the guidance provided by LUBA and the Court of Appeals, the County amended
its EFU zone in 2011 to more clearly implement the statutory EFU zone provisions for solid
waste disposal sites shown in italic type above. The County's text amendment was appealed to
LUBA and was affirmed.

The amended text of Section 402.02 (Permitted Uses) of the County's EFU zone is shown
below:

     V. The maintenance, expansion or enhancement of an existing site on the same tract for the
     disposal of solid waste for which a permit has been granted under ORS 459.245 by the
     Department of Environmental Quality, together with equipment, facilities or buildings
     necessary for its operation. The use must satisfy the standards set forth in ORS 215.296(1)(a)
     and (b) and the standards set forth in Section 1101, Site Design Review. The maintenance,
     expansion or enhancement of an existing use on the same tract of high-value farmland is
     permissible only if the existing use is wholly with a farm use zone. No other Yamhill County
     Zoning Ordinance criteria or Comprehensive Plan goal or policy shall apply as an approval
     standard for this use.

Approval of this PA/ZC to rezone Riverbend Landfill and Tax Lots 101, 200 and 401 from
PWS and RC to EFU is clearly consistent with ORS 215.283(2)(k), with OAR 660-033-0130(18)
and with YCZO 402.02(V) because the maintenance of an existing disposal site is a permitted
non-farm use under state and county regulations.

Goal 3 provides that Counties may authorize farm uses and those nonfarm uses defined by
commission rule that will not have significant adverse effects on accepted farm or forest
practices. An implementation guideline for Goal 3 states that non-farm uses permitted with farm
use zones under ORS 215.213(2) and (3) and 215.283(2) and (3) should be minimized to allow
for maximum productivity.

In amending its EFU zone, the County took steps to minimize non-farm uses (solid waste
disposal sites) more tightly than ORS 215.283(2)(k) or OAR 660-033-0130(18). The statute and
Goal 3 rule would allow a "new" solid waste disposal site on non-high value farmland zoned
EFU. The County's EFU zone, by contrast, only allows the "maintenance, expansion or
enhancement of an existing site...(emphasis added).

The proposed PA/ZC from PWS and RC to EFU includes other characteristics that serve to
minimize non-farm uses:

     1. The Future Expansion Area includes a parcel (Tax Lot 401) that has historically been
        zoned RC.

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                           Page 24
Riverbend Landfill                                                                          September 2013
     2. The Future Expansion Area also includes a parcel (northerly portion of Tax Lot 400)
        that has been managed and irrigated with leachate as part of the landfill operation.
     3. The existing infrastructure and improvements that exist at this location can be leveraged
        to minimize the area needed for the future expansion and non-farm uses.
RLC recognizes that approval of the PA/ZC to EFU does not authorize the development of a
specific solid waste and disposal facility and provides only the opportunity to submit a
subsequent application for future expansion. A specific expansion proposal would have to
demonstrate that it does not force a significant change in or significantly increase the costs of
accepted farm or forest practices on surrounding lands, and would be subject to approval
through the county's Site Design Review process, which addresses the compatibility of a specific
development with surrounding land uses.

Agriculture is the predominant land-use within a 1-mile radius of the Riverbend Landfill. Crops
are irrigated with water derived from the South Yamhill River. Additional water is pumped from
private wells to the south and east of the landfill. Presently, most of the land in the immediate
vicinity of the landfill is used in a rotation of grass seed and grains in addition to hazelnut
orchards. The most common grass seed and grains grown include perennial ryegrass, wheat, tall
fescue, white clover, and to a smaller extent red clover or radish seed, orchard grass, and
pasture/hay production. Vegetable crops are also grown along with dry peas, beans, and corn.
There is at least one tree and shrub nursery and walnut orchard. Livestock in the area is sparse
with only a few small pastures for cows. Sheep are moved to some of the white clover fields in
the winter.

Farming practices in the vicinity of Riverbend Landfill are usually performed by field workers
hired to manage specific crop varieties. The field men will conduct a soil test to determine the
condition of the soil and what type of amendments are necessary. This allows for proper
nutrient management of particular crops.

Before planting grass seed crops, typically a soil test is conducted to determine soil pH,
phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and lime. Nitrogen is needed by all grass seed
crops to promote adequate vegetative growth, though the application rates vary for specific grass
species. Only a small amount of fall nitrogen is recommended for tall fescue and none is
required for perennial ryegrass.

Legume seed crops typically fixate nitrogen, therefore little, if any, fertilizer nitrogen is needed. A
soil test can be performed to verify soil pH, phosphorus, potassium, and boron. Field practices
can include the application of biosolids and manure for fertilization.

Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
Organic farming practices are not regularly employed in the area with few exceptions. Chemical
spraying is commonly done in the early fall when prevailing winds from the northwest are calm.
Certain seed varieties such as wheat may be pre-treated with an insecticide. The OSU Weed
Science Group conducts greenhouse, laboratory, and small plot herbicide evaluation trials to
support the development of weed management activities in western Oregon. Labeled and
experimental herbicides are evaluated for crop safety and weed control efficacy in the following
crops: Winter and spring wheat, cool-season grasses grown for seed, native cool-season grasses
and forbs grown for seed, canola, meadowfoam, camelina, clovers, and peppermint among
others.

Riverbend Landfill sits in the heart of the County's agricultural region. All of the uses adjacent to
the current landfill are agricultural with the exception of the RV park and the closed Whiteson
Landfill. Riverbend Landfill has a 20-year track record of compatibility with uses adjacent to the
existing landfill. Although some owners of agricultural property adjacent to the existing landfill
have opposed the future expansion, there is no evidence that the farming or agricultural
operations on farms adjacent to the current landfill have been negatively impacted by the
existing landfill. Even if such impacts do exist, the PA/ZC and conceptual future expansion will
not increase those impacts, because the expansion will merely shift the operations to other areas
as the existing disposal areas are closed.

Landfill operations are very similar to other agricultural operations and create similar conditions.
The externalities from a landfill such as noise, dust, and odor are more highly regulated than
farm practices in the same area. Individuals in the surrounding areas have a broad array of
mechanisms for ensuring that such externalities do not violate health or other standards.
Landfills must adhere to certain DEQ regulations relating to noise. Stormwater runoff is
similarly regulated, whereas runoff from agricultural lands is not.

Landfills tend to attract birds and other wildlife, particularly those that are scavengers; mainly
seagulls, starlings, crows, and ravens. The strength of that attraction is based mainly on 1)
weather-related and/or seasonal issues, and 2) the availability of food in the landfill vicinity.

RLC has contracted with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services (USDAWS) to
aid in the control of birds to augment RLC's ongoing bird control program. RLC has a current
bird control permit and uses a number of techniques to control the bird population. This permit
will be more fully utilized with the help of USDAWS during those times of the year when birds
are more likely to frequent the landfill. By taking this additional action, RLC will be performing a
valuable service to the local agricultural community by eliminating birds that might otherwise
contribute to agricultural problems regardless of the landfill. Growing grapes and other food



Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                         Page 26
Riverbend Landfill                                                                        September 2013
crops also attract birds. This is evidenced in part by the use of bird cannons that is a common
practice for vineyards and other farming operations.

RLC started the Riverbend Falconry Program in November 2012 to provide falconry-based bird
abatement at Riverbend Landfill. The objective of the program is to reduce populations of
starlings and seagulls by fundamentally changing the birds' flight and foraging patterns to make
Riverbend Landfill and neighboring properties an inhospitable place for birds to frequent.

RLC has contracted with Airstrike Bird Control, LLC to provide falconry-based bird abatement
at Riverbend Landfill. This business has 35 years of commercial practice in aviation, solid waste
and agricultural settings. The approach is a non-lethal solution designed to achieve enduring
results. The falcons are well-known around Yamhill County vineyards, where they perform
similar duty. At vineyards, their mission is to keep away fruit-eating birds from grape-laden vines
toward harvest time.

At the RLC property, Airstrike deploys a squad of four falcons from four to six days a week.

When Airstrike started work at the landfill, falconers counted 500 seagulls and 4,000 starlings.
The goal was to cut the population to less than 100 gulls and 300 starlings. Based on recent data
collection, only a few gulls currently visit the landfill on a regular basis. Starlings have been
reduced from 4,000 to 200. Ravens currently average fewer than 50 during operational hours.

In management of birds and other issues, RLC is committed to adaptive management and
multiple approaches to assure that continued operation of the landfill will not force significant
changes in farm practices or costs. Approval of this PA/ZC to EFU complies with Goal 3
because the particular use is authorized by Statute, Administrative Rule and the County's EFU
zone. The County has limited the potential scope of this particular non-farm use by prohibiting
establishment of new landfills on low and high-value farmlands, and by requiring specific
development proposals to go through the Site Design Review Process.

D. Goal 4 ­ Forest Lands
     To conserve forest lands by maintaining the forest land base and to protect the state's forest
     economy by making possible economically efficient forest practices that assure the
     continuous growing and harvesting of forest species as the leading use on forest land
     consistent with sound management of soil, air, water, and fish and wildlife resources and to
     provide for recreational opportunities and agriculture.

Response: The County's acknowledged comprehensive plan identifies and protects forest lands
with the Forestry Zone (F-80), and mixed agriculture/forestry areas with the
Agriculture/Forestry Zone (AF-20, AF-40, AF-80). Properties in the Agriculture/Forestry Zone



Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                              Page 27
Riverbend Landfill                                                                           September 2013
are primarily foothill and ridgetop holdings above the flat terrace and valley-floor commercial
agriculture areas, and below the contiguous timberlands of the Coast Range.

None of the parcels included in this PA/ZC, or any contiguous parcels in the vicinity, are
designated for Forestry or Agriculture/Forestry in the Plan. Therefore, Goal 4 is not relevant or
applicable to the zone change area (from PWS and RC to EFU) or the Future Expansion Area.

E. Goal 5 ­ Open Spaces, Scenic and Historic Areas, and Natural Resources
      To protect natural resources and conserve scenic and historic areas and open spaces.

Response: Goal 5 requires that local governments adopt programs to protect significant natural
resources and conserve significant scenic, historic, and open space resources for present and
future generations. The procedures and requirements for complying with Goal 5 are outlined in
OAR 660, Division 23.

The County has an acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations. The proposed
PA/ZC from PWS and RC to EFU is defined as a "post-acknowledgement plan amendment"
(PAPA) under the Goal 5 rule. OAR 660-023-0250 outlines the applicability of Goal 5 to PAPAs
as follows:

(1)        The requirements of Goal 5 do not apply to land use decisions made pursuant to
           acknowledged comprehensive plans and land use regulations.

(2)        The requirements of this division are applicable to PAPAs initiated on or after
           September 1, 1996.

(3)        Local governments are not required to apply Goal 5 in consideration of a PAPA
           unless the PAPA affects a Goal 5 resource. For purposes of this section, a PAPA
           would affect a Goal 5 resource only if:

           (a)       The PAPA creates or amends a resource list or a portion of an acknowledged
                     plan or land use regulation adopted in order to protect a significant Goal 5
                     resource to address specific requirements of Goal 5;

           (b)       The PAPA allows new uses that could be conflicting uses with a particular
                     significant Goal 5 resource site on an acknowledged resource list; or

           (c)       The PAPA amends an acknowledged UGB and factual information is
                     submitted demonstrating that a resource site, or the impact areas of such a
                     site, is included in the amended UGB area.

(4)        Consideration of a PAPA regarding a specific resource site, or regarding a specific
           provision of a Goal 5 implementing measure, does not require a local government to
           revise acknowledged inventories or other implementing measures, for the resource
           site or for other Goal 5 sites, that are not affected by the PAPA, regardless of


Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                              Page 28

           whether such inventories or provisions were acknowledged under this rule or under
           OAR 660, Division 16.

RLC's PA/ZC request does not create or amend the County's Goal 5 resource list, create or
amend a land use regulation adopted to protect a significant Goal 5 resource, or amend an
acknowledged urban growth boundary. Therefore, the only portion of the Goal 5 rule potentially
applicable to this PA/ZC application is OAR 660-023-0250(3)(b), which requires the County to
determine whether the PAPA will allow a new use that could be a conflicting use with a
particular significant Goal 5 resource on the County's acknowledged resource list.

RLC's PA/ZC request applies only to Tax Lots 101, 200, and 401. Each of those tax lots is
currently developed with a non-farm use, and two of those lots already contain solid waste
disposal operations. If the lots currently zoned PWS are rezoned to EFU, Riverbend Landfill
will be maintained on those existing lots (Tax Lots 101 and 200). Therefore, the PA/ZC will not
have allowed any new use on those lots that does not already exist and Goal 5 is not triggered
for those lots. However, because the lot zoned RC (Tax Lot 401) would be rezoned to EFU and
allow a new use that is not currently allowed on that lot, RLC assumes that Goal 5 is triggered
for that lot. This application, therefore, addresses the Goal 5 requirements and considers
whether the allowed new use potentially conflicts with any particular significant Goal 5 resource
on the County's acknowledged resource list.

Latimer Environmental LLC prepared a Goal 5 Report for the proposed PA/ZC.24 The report
documents the significant Goal 5 resources that the County has identified within the areas
currently zoned PWS and RC, as well as the areas currently zoned EFU that are within the
conceptual Future Expansion Area (see Figure 1). The Goal 5 report has been prepared to assist
the County in determining if the proposed PA/ZC and conceptual future expansion comply
with Goal 5 and with policies in the County's Plan implementing Goal 5. Goal 5 resources
addressed in the report include the following:

           Riparian Corridors                                   Wetlands
           Wildlife Habitat                                     Federal Wild and Scenic Rivers
           Oregon Scenic Waterways                              Groundwater Resources
           Approved Oregon Recreation Trails                    Natural Areas

As documented in the Goal 5 report (see Attachment C), the County's acknowledged Goal 5
resource list does not designate any significant Goal 5 resources in the vicinity of RLC's Current
Permitted Area or the Future Expansion Area other than riparian corridors. Although the
County's acknowledged Goal 5 resource list does not specifically identify "riparian corridors," it
does include provisions for the protection of "riparian zones" of fish bearing streams, e.g., the
South Yamhill River.

The PAPA would provide the opportunity for RLC to apply for a future expansion in proximity
to the riparian area around the South Yamhill River. A solid waste disposal site could be a
conflicting use with such a resource. Therefore, RLC assumes the PAPA triggers the
applicability of Goal 5 under OAR 660-023-0250(3)(b) with respect to riparian corridors.

1. Riparian Corridors
Under OAR 660-023-0090 a riparian corridor is a Goal 5 resource that includes the water areas,
fish habitat, adjacent riparian areas, and wetlands within the riparian area boundary. During the
PAPA process, the County may choose to adopt a safe harbor approach to identify and protect
Goal 5 resources.25 In the case of riparian corridors, the safe harbor approach for identifying
significance resources is to adhere to a specific setback:

       The significant riparian corridor area setback is 75 feet from the top of bank of a waterway
       with an annual average stream flow greater than 1,000 cubic feet per second [e.g., South
       Yamhill River], and 50 feet for other fish-bearing streams [e.g., unnamed tributaries].

As part of this PAPA, RLC proposes that the County identify riparian corridors using the safe
harbor approach (OAR 660-023-0090(5)), which results in a riparian corridor of 50 feet to either
side (from top-of-bank) of each unnamed stream and 75 feet from the South Yamhill River.

The County's Water Resources Policy J26 addresses significant riparian areas by protecting
vegetation within 100-feet of streams identified as "fish habitat" in the Plan inventory:

J.           It is the policy of Yamhill County to protect riparian vegetation from damage that
            may result from land use applications for development that is otherwise permitted
            outright or conditionally under county zoning regulations. To achieve this goal,
            Yamhill County will review land use applications for development in riparian areas
            in an effort to mitigate or prevent damage to riparian vegetation that might result
            from the development. For purposes of this policy, "riparian areas" refers to areas

25
   OAR 660-023-0020(2) A "safe harbor" consists of an optional course of action that satisfies certain requirements under
the standard process. Local governments may follow safe harbor requirements rather than addressing certain requirements
in the standard Goal 5 process. For example, a jurisdiction may choose to identify "significant" riparian corridors using the
safe harbor criteria under OAR 660-023-0090(5) rather than follow the general requirements for determining "significance"
in the standard Goal 5 process under OAR 660-023-0030(4). Similarly, a jurisdiction may adopt a wetlands ordinance that
meets the requirements of OAR 660-023-0100(4)(b) in lieu of following the ESEE decision process in OAR 660-023-0040.

           within 100 feet measured horizontally from the ordinary high water line of streams
           identified as "Fish Habitat" in the comprehensive plan inventory (Natural Resource
           Conservation Plan, Yamhill County, Oregon, May 1979 -U.S.D.A. - Soil
           Conservation Services), that are not regulated under the Forest Practices Act. (Ord
           471).

To ensure consistency with the County's Policy J, RLC proposes that the County apply a 100-
foot setback from the ordinary high water line of all three streams to protect riparian vegetation
within the identified riparian corridors. Within that larger setback area, RLC proposes to adhere
to the safe harbor provisions of OAR 660-023-0090(8) as a means of protecting significant
riparian corridors in the project area. To that end, RLC recommends that the County adopt
specific ordinance language implementing the safe harbor provisions for protecting riparian
corridors as set forth in OAR 660-023-0090(8). That rule provides the following:

(8)        As a safe harbor in lieu of following the Economic, Social, Environmental, and
           Energy (ESEE) process requirements of OAR 660-023-0040 and 660-023-0050, a
           local government may adopt an ordinance to protect a significant riparian corridor
           as follows:

(a)        The ordinance shall prevent permanent alteration of the riparian area by grading or
           by the placement of structures or impervious surfaces, except for the following uses,
           provided they are designed and constructed to minimize intrusion into the riparian
           area:

(A)        Streets, roads, and paths;

(B)        Drainage facilities, utilities, and irrigation pumps;

(C)        Water-related and water-dependent uses; and

(D)        Replacement of existing structures with structures in the same location that do not
           disturb additional riparian surface area.

(b)        The ordinance shall contain provisions to control the removal of riparian vegetation,
           except that the ordinance shall allow:

(A)        Removal of non-native vegetation and replacement with native plant species; and

(B)        Removal of vegetation necessary for the development of water-related or water-
           dependent uses;

(c)        Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the ordinance need not regulate the
           removal of vegetation in areas zoned for farm or forest uses pursuant to statewide
           Goals 3 or 4;

(d)        The ordinance shall include a procedure to consider hardship variances, claims of
           map error, and reduction or removal of the restrictions under subsections (a) and (b)
           of this section for any existing lot or parcel demonstrated to have been rendered not
           buildable by application of the ordinance; and

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                                Page 31
Riverbend Landfill                                                                               September 2013
(e)        The ordinance may authorize the permanent alteration of the riparian area by
           placement of structures or impervious surfaces within the riparian corridor boundary
           established under subsection (5)(a) of this rule upon a demonstration that equal or
           better protection for identified resources will be ensured through restoration of
           riparian areas, enhanced buffer treatment, or similar measures. In no case shall such
           alterations occupy more than 50 percent of the width of the riparian area measured
           from the upland edge of the corridor.

However, RLC recommends that the County's ordinance language be more protective of the
riparian corridor by not including the exclusion applicable to EFU lands described in subsection
(c) of that rule. Technically, under OAR 660-023-0090(8)(c), the County can implement Goal 5
without regulating the removal of riparian vegetation in areas zoned for farm use, which would
exclude the area subject to this PA/ZC application. However, in keeping with the spirit of Goal
5 and the County's existing Goal 5 protections contained in Policy J., RLC advocates for
controlling the removal of riparian vegetation within the identified riparian corridors. RLC has
included draft ordinance language addressing the safe harbor riparian corridor protections as
Attachment D to this narrative.

In summary, the Goal 5 requirements pertaining to significant riparian corridors will be satisfied
with adoption of the safe-harbor ordinance provisions in conjunction with the PAPA. No other
significant Goal 5 resources exist in the area, but RLC will continue to preserve and protect
other natural and cultural resources as outlined in other areas of this narrative.

F. Goal 6 ­ Air, Water and Land Resources Quality
      To maintain and improve the quality of the air, water and land resources of the state.

Response: Goal 6 addresses the quality of air, water, and land resources. In the context of Plan
amendments, a local government complies with Goal 6 by explaining why it is reasonable to
expect that the proposed uses authorized by the plan amendment would be able to satisfy
applicable federal and state environmental standards, including air and water quality standards.

As previously noted this PA/ZC request does not seek approval of a specific development.
However, RLC intends to utilize the new zoning for an expansion of the existing landfill,
including the addition of an envisioned Green Technology facility and the use of nearby land for
operations support. Landfills are subject to federal regulation by the RCRA. Subtitle D of
RCRA, promulgated in 1993, has two primary focuses: 1) it specifically excludes a large array of
hazardous wastes from being landfilled at municipal solid waste disposal sites such as Riverbend
Landfill; and 2) it requires sophisticated, highly-engineered liner and cover systems for landfills.
States such as Oregon adopted these federal rules, and many states (including Oregon) made the
rules even more stringent.



Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                              Page 32
Riverbend Landfill                                                                             September 2013
Before these regulations were promulgated, local governments did not give much consideration
to the requirements of land-based waste containment. As impacts of poorly-managed municipal
and industrial waste practices on the environment became apparent, the regulations became
more and more protective of the natural environment and human health. Because of the
increased costs to meet these regulations, it became necessary for local governments to close
local landfills and to rely on regional landfills that meet Subtitle D environmental protection
requirements and are capable of managing larger amounts of waste that generate sufficient
revenue.

1. Liner System
The hallmark of Subtitle D regulations is the liner system, which includes a bottom-liner system
constructed before waste is initiated, and a cover liner system constructed after a waste module
is closed. The bottom liner system is comprised of several components and the entire system is
several feet thick. The liner system begins at the bottom with a finished subgrade that allows the
upper layers to be constructed in a manner that directs leachate in a specified direction for
collection. On top of the subgrade is an impervious geomembrane layer called the Secondary
Geomembrane. On top of the Secondary Geomembrane is a drainage layer comprised of a
geocomposite strip drain and a blanket drain geotextile. On top of these layers is a two-foot layer
of compacted clay or its equivalent. On top of the clay is the impervious Primary
Geomembrane, which is again topped with drainage layers consisting of cushion geotextile,
gravel and more geotextile fabric. On top of this primary drainage system is the operations layer,
which is typically a one-foot thick soil layer that acts as a protective physical buffer between the
waste and the liner system.

After waste is placed on top of the liner system, leachate will begin to form. The leachate is
allowed to drain through the drainage layers consisting of cushion geotextile, gravel and
geotextile fabric and is collected in drain pipes. The Primary Geomembrane is designed to
prevent the leachate from going any further. In the unlikely event that leachate was leaked
through the Primary Geomembrane layer, the clay layer serves as another barrier. In the event
that leachate moved through the clay layer, it would then collect on top of the Secondary
Geomembrane. If any leachate collects there, it is drained to a monitoring point within the
secondary containment (leak detection) system that alerts the landfill operator of a leak in the
Primary Geomembrane.

The double-composite liner system, which includes the leak detection and leachate collection
layers, allows management of leachate and long-term monitoring capability of primary leachate
generation and leakage. By designing the leak detection and leachate collection systems with
effective liquid collection efficiency and a large factor of safety against clogging and degradation,
the modern liner system as constructed at Riverbend Landfill will provide a redundant design

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                         Page 33
Riverbend Landfill                                                                        September 2013
with a very high degree of long-term reliability. The reliability of this type of liner system goes
beyond the minimum requirements of Subtitle D, which requires only a single composite liner
for long-term waste containment.

Following placement of waste within the lined system, Subtitle D also requires placement of a
long-term closure cap (cover system) on top of the final waste grades. That cap includes soil and
geosynthetic barrier layers, drainage layers, and topsoil. The cover provides a containment
barrier that will limit further leachate generation and effectively promotes landfill gas collection
by the gas-collection wells.

The liner and cover systems are designed to provide long-term durability against chemical and
biological degradation, cracking, seismic events, meteoric weather events, flora and fauna, and
aging. The life of these systems is expected to be on the order of centuries, and designed in a
manner that allows them to be monitored, and the cover system maintained. The long life span
ensures that the liner system is in place long after it is needed.

RLC is required to accrue funding during landfill operations to allow full post-closure
monitoring and maintenance to be performed for a minimum of 30 years past the point that the
last ton of waste is received at the landfill. DEQ can in fact require post-closure maintenance
and monitoring to extend beyond 30 years if it deems that the landfill still requires that type of
care.

The landfill cap that is installed is directly available for inspection and maintenance, and it is a
regulatory requirement to ensure that the cover system continues to function as designed
throughout the post-closure period. The leachate collection, leak detection, landfill gas
collection, and groundwater monitoring systems will all be effective indicators of exactly how the
landfill will be performing during the post-closure period.

The quality of leachate recovered from the bottom of the modern-day landfills (including
Riverbend Landfill) is relatively benign compared to the hazardous character of leachates that
may have existed in pre-Subtitle D landfills and is a testament to the effectiveness of the liners.
Groundwater impacts due to leachate contamination at modern lined landfills are zero-to-
insignificant compared with those created by pre-Subtitle D facilities. This is true for Riverbend
Landfill, which has a long history of meeting groundwater quality standards established by DEQ
resulting from in-place liner systems.

2. DEQ Testimony
During the public hearings before the Planning Commission and the Board for the Riverbend
Expansion proposed in 2008, staff from DEQ testified at length regarding RLC's environmental


Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                         Page 34
Riverbend Landfill                                                                        September 2013
compliance (DEQ Testimony).27 With respect to water quality, the DEQ Testimony addressed
specifically the robust liner system, leachate collection and removal system and environmental
monitoring program that DEQ requires of landfill operations. The DEQ Testimony was clear
that RLC is in compliance with all of its permits, which protect water quality, and that DEQ
would continue to enforce the same regulations on any future expansion. With respect to the
Future Expansion Areas, the DEQ Testimony stated that site characterization is an important
aspect of controlling potential environmental impacts and that the landfill expansion site is in an
area where potential impacts to water quality are very predictable and, therefore, more easily
avoided or mitigated. That aspect of the proposed site expansion exists, in part, because of the
long history of environmental monitoring that has occurred due to the presence of the existing
landfill.

With respect to air quality, the DEQ Testimony stated that RLC is in compliance with its DEQ-
issued air quality permit and the DEQ would continue to enforce the same regulations on the
expanded portion of the landfill. Because odor is caused by landfill gas and landfill gas is
regulated as part of DEQ's air quality oversight, the DEQ Testimony also addressed odor in
great detail. The DEQ Testimony stated that it is possible to keep odors to a manageable level
even as landfill gas quantities increase.

RLC acknowledges that odor has historically been a concern for neighbors of Riverbend
Landfill. Landfill gas collection is not an exact science and occasionally there will be odor
associated with landfill operations, but it should not be a common problem for neighbors. The
operation of the landfill gas collection system improved significantly when RLC discovered the
system performance was influenced by the presence of liquid. By installing dewatering pumps,
RLC has been able to remove liquid from the landfill gas collection pipes and extraction wells.
This allows the landfill gas collection system to more effectively extract gas out of the landfill
waste. RLC also improved odor management by reducing the active working area of the landfill
significantly and by improving the cover system.

RLC is monitoring the landfill gas management system closely and will continue to expand and
improve the system in the years ahead as necessary. The expectation is that neighbors and
passersby will rarely detect odor because of significant investments to expand and enhance the
system. RLC has the expertise to control odor and is committed to continuous improvement.

Based on the foregoing, RLC's PA/ZC and conceptual future expansion will be able to satisfy
applicable federal and state environmental regulatory standards, including those for air, surface
water, and groundwater. This conclusion is largely supported by the fact that the proposal is an

expansion of an existing facility that has demonstrated an excellent record of compliance with
DEQ environmental regulations and standards that apply to landfills

Following the County land use approval of this PA/ZC and subsequent Site Design Review
application for the Future Expansion Area, DEQ must review and approve a modification of
the existing Solid Waste Disposal Permit before RLC could expand outside its Current
Permitted Area. As part of that permitting, DEQ would have to review and approve an updated
Site Development Plan and site characterization for the expansion, including technical
information to address DEQ rules and design criteria for (1) leachate management, (2) surface
water management, (3) landfill gas management, and (4) environmental monitoring.

Since the time DEQ provided testimony to the County regarding Riverbend Landfill, RLC has
continued to obtain permits from DEQ. These permits include recent updates to the Title V air
quality permit and, more significantly, approval for the construction of the MSE Berm. During
those processes, DEQ rigorously reviewed the environmental conditions at Riverbend Landfill.

In summary, it is reasonable to expect that RLC will continue to satisfy state and federal
environmental standards for maintaining and improving the quality of the air, water and land
resources as required by Goal 6.

G. Goal 7 ­ Areas Subject to Natural Disasters and Hazards
     To protect people and property from natural hazards.

Response: Goal 7, which LCDC amended on June 1, 2002, addresses hazards to development.
As amended, the goal requires DLCD to review new hazard inventory information provided by
federal or state agencies in consultation with affected local government representatives.
Thereafter, DLCD would notify the local governments if new hazard information requires a
local response. Since the amendments to Goal 7 took effect, DLCD has taken no action to
require that the County update inventories or regulations for natural hazards.

Federal criteria for MSW landfills (RCRA Subtitle D) took effect beginning October 9, 1993.
These criteria address location, operation, and design of landfills, groundwater monitoring,
closure and post-closure care, financial assurance, and remedial action if problems occur.

Federal criteria restrict landfill siting in certain locations. Two of these criteria apply to
Riverbend Landfill's location: floodplains and seismic impact zones.

1. Floodplains
A landfill located in a floodplain must not restrict the flow of the 100-year flood, reduce the
temporary water storage capacity of the floodplain, or result in washout of solid waste to pose a

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                            Page 36

hazard to human health and the environment. Riverbend Landfill is located outside the floodway
of the South Yamhill River, the floodway being the minimum area of a river required to convey
flows associated with a 100-year flood event. A portion of the landfill was originally constructed
within the 100-year floodplain pursuant to a floodplain development permit the County issued
concurrently with the original land use approval for the landfill (Order No. 80-262). The U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) assisted the County and RLC with siting the landfill by
conducting hydraulic analyses that allowed the County to conclude that the landfill could safely
operate in its current location, while also not encroaching on the floodway. The landfill includes
a permanent flood protection berm that lies outside the floodway.

RLC recently worked with Yamhill County in obtaining a Letter of Map Revision from FEMA
that resulted in a more accurate depiction of the 100-year floodplain and floodway in the reach
of the South Yamhill River associated with Riverbend Landfill. The Map Revision was adopted
by FEMA on May 9, 201328. The revision was based on more accurate topographic data than
was used in the 1980s. The updated topography accounted for all changes since the 1980s,
including the presence of Riverbend Landfill and Whiteson Landfill. The revision also required
the use of the Corps' most modern hydraulic modeling methods and software. As a result, the
Flood Insurance Rate Maps now portray the correct locations of the 100-year floodplain and
floodway in the vicinity of the landfills. Those maps will be used to guide future development
consistent with County and FEMA regulations.

2. Seismic Impact Zones
A landfill in an earthquake zone must be designed to withstand the maximum horizontal
acceleration at the site. Riverbend is located in a seismic impact zone. According to DEQ,
Riverbend's slope stability analysis showed that the safety factors against slope failure are
adequate for the excavation and final cover of the waste cells under the current permit. In
addition, RLC is required to meet Subtitle D seismic resistance requirements for all
containments. This design standard is similar to seismic design standards (Uniform Building
Code) for other facilities in the surrounding area.

DEQ recently completed an extensive review and approved a proposal for construction of a
MSE berm along the west side of Riverbend Landfill. The MSE berm, which is 2,100 feet long
and up to 40 feet high, will allow disposal capacity for an additional one million cubic yards of
waste within the approved permit area.29

The DEQ Review Report for the MSE berm (February 22, 2013) included a detailed summary
of the geotechnical evaluation. Geotechnical information was obtained by drilling 14 borings and
excavating seven test pits in the area of the proposed MSE berm. Soil characteristics were
determined based on standard penetration tests in the field, followed by soil lab testing. In
addition, a geophysical survey was conducted to obtain shear wave velocity information for site
soils.

Based on a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, RLC's consultant (Dr. Norm Abrahamson)
recommended using a magnitude 8.5 earthquake with a peak ground acceleration of 0.415g. This
peak ground acceleration was calculated for a rock site. Subsequently, seismic response analysis
was performed to determine the amplification or attenuation of the rock peak ground
acceleration based on the site specific soil profile obtained from testing.

DEQ required that RLC's consultant provide an updated evaluation that takes into account the
most recent seismic data, including the recent earthquakes in Chile and Japan. The consultant
provided a written response on January 8, 2013 and concluded that the probabilistic seismic
hazard analysis report "remains a reasonable characterization for the hazard at the Riverbend
Landfill site."

DEQ hired Hart Crowser to assist in independently reviewing the seismic characterization of
this site. Hart Crowser concurred with the findings of RLC and its consultants.

Certain soils, especially loose, sandy soils, can flow during earthquakes, a process referred to as
"liquefaction", causing significant damage to structures supported by those soils. Based on soil
properties described in the Review Report, DEQ concluded that the amount of liquefaction at
this site would be limited and would not result in significant damage of the proposed MSE berm
or the rest of the landfill from the design level earthquake.

The MSE berm was also evaluated for external stability in terms of overturning, eccentricity,
sliding, bearing capacity, pullout and slope stability. These parameters were evaluated under both
static and seismic conditions. As summarized in the Review Report, the static factors of safety
exceed design safety factors in all cases.

During the DEQ review process for the MSE berm, landfill opponents stated that DEQ should
require a design based on a magnitude 9.0 earthquake, noting that other agencies require this. To
address this concern, DEQ contacted the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral
Industries (DOGAMI) and requested a written opinion as to whether a 9.0 magnitude
earthquake should be considered in the design of Riverbend Landfill.

In a January 16, 2013 letter, DOGAMI recommended that DEQ "consider in designs for
expansion to this landfill the magnitude 9.0 Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake." Following
receipt of that letter, DEQ met with DOGAMI twice, on January 29 and February 4, 2013.
Based on these meetings, DOGAMI concluded that the probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis
completed for the site used a reasonable approach and that the magnitude 9.0 earthquake was
considered and integrated into the probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis. RLC would undergo a
similarly rigorous analysis as part of any future permitting process.

3. Goal 7 Summary
Given the available information on floodplain and seismic risks and the recent characterization
of site conditions through the FEMA Letter of Map Revision and DEQ's review of the MSE
berm, it is reasonable to conclude that the conceptual future expansion could be designed to
protect people and property from natural hazards and it would be feasible to obtain necessary
permits. RLC understands that the floodplain and seismic standards that are in effect when an
application is submitted for the future expansion would control, and could be more stringent
than the standards that were applied to the construction of the MSE berm.

H. Goal 8 ­ Recreational Needs
     To satisfy the recreational needs of the citizens of the state and visitors and, where
     appropriate, to provide for the siting of necessary recreational facilities including destination
     resorts.

Response: The County Comprehensive Parks and Open Space Master Plan (2003) states that
Yamhill County currently owns and maintains 17 parks and open space areas totaling 126.4
acres. Ten of the sites are developed, six are undeveloped, and one is leased. The Parks and
Open Space Master Plan also describes the two county-owned and decommissioned landfills,
one located near Monroe Boat Landing on the South Yamhill River (Whiteson Landfill) and one
near Rogers Landing on the Willamette River (Newberg Landfill). The plan indicates that both
former landfill sites have potential for passive recreation and open space once reclamation is
complete.

The County received a grant from the State Marine Board to develop the small park and boat
launch on the south side of the South Yamhill River on County-owned land adjacent to the
closed Whiteson Landfill (Monroe Landing). As shown in Figure 4, the 6-acre site is zoned
Parks, Recreation and Open Space (PRO). However, the County has had problems maintaining
the boat launch and park site because of flooding issues and vandalism due to its relative
isolation. The access road into the park site is currently gated and vehicle access is restricted.
Individuals must call the County and obtain permission to access the park site on a day use basis.

The Board recently approved a Conditional Use Permit and Site Design Review application to
allow development of another public park contiguous to Whiteson Landfill, to the south side of
the South Yamhill River.30 The day use public park was approved as a conditional use on an
approximately 46 acre site in the EFU zone. The Parks Department carefully looked at the
surrounding agricultural areas and developed the park proposal in such a way as to blend the
park with the surrounding landscape and construct facilities intended to support low-impact and
dispersed recreational uses.

During the review process for the new public park, testimony was raised that a former landfill
site is not an appropriate location for a public park. The Parks Department responded that
development of a park adjacent to or on top of a former landfill site is not a new concept, and
there are many examples, both locally and nationwide, where former landfill sites have been
converted to public park use. Additionally, in the approved Site Design Review application,
Yamhill County Parks did not propose any development activities on the actual footprint of the
former landfill site that has been in post closure since 1985. Instead, Yamhill County Parks
focused all development activities on the county-owned properties that surround the former
landfill site, to allow more time for post-closure activities and monitoring.

The PA/ZC to EFU and conceptual Future Expansion Area would not impact the designated
Monroe Landing or new (unnamed) park site south of the river. The extensive floodplain and
established riparian corridor along the South Yamhill River provides a substantial buffer
between the active landfill and low-intensity park and its recreational uses. Additionally, RLC is
exploring wetland and habitat enhancement activities in the floodway adjacent to the river as
part of the WM Stewardship Project that could complement existing or future enjoyment of the
County-owned park site south of the South Yamhill River. RLC understands that improving
access to waterways and expanding trails is a key objective of the Parks and Open Space Master
Plan and is exploring similar opportunities on the WM Stewardship lands.

A portion of the Future Expansion Area (Tax Lot 401) is currently zoned RC and is developed
as a recreational vehicle (RV) park. The Mulkey RV Park property is owned by RLC and
operated under a lease. The County Commissioners took a "built and committed" exception for
the RV Park when the Plan was adopted in 1979. Therefore, the RV Park was not established
based on a public need for the use, but rather was grandfathered as an established use. There are
other RV parks available in proximity to Highway 18 to accommodate tourists and visitors to the
County, including the Wandering Spirit RV Park near the Spirit Mountain Casino in Grand
Ronde (129 spaces) and the Willamette Wine Country RV Park (191 spaces) adjacent to
Highway 18 and the South Yamhill River near the City of Dayton. Neither the Yamhill County

Plan nor the Parks and Open Space Master Plan have identified a specific "need" for land zoned
Recreational Commercial or for overnight facilities, including RV Parks.

The State of Oregon scenic byways program makes money available for projects along roadways
designated as National Scenic Byways, All-American Roads, or State Scenic Byways. The State of
Oregon designates Scenic Byways according to prescribed criteria in OAR 734 Division 32.
Designations are approved jointly by the Oregon Transportation Commission and the Oregon
Tourism Commission. Highway 18 is not designated as a scenic byway under the State of
Oregon program.

Even though Highway 18 is not designated as a scenic byway, RLC recognizes that the highway
provides an important transportation corridor to access tourist and recreational destinations
such as the Oregon coast, wineries, and the Spirit Mountain Casino. Because the Future
Expansion Area extends toward Highway 18, RLC understands that a future Site Development
Review would likely consider appropriate screening and buffering (such as a berm and plantings)
to reduce visibility of the landfill by travelers on Highway 18.

Based on the foregoing, this PA/ZC and conceptual future expansion is consistent with Goal 8.

I. Goal 9 ­ Economic Development
     To provide adequate opportunities throughout the state for a variety of economic activities
     vital to the health, welfare, and prosperity of Oregon's citizens.

Response: Although RLC's PA/ZC application does not involve commercial or industrial lands
typically subject to Goal 9,31 the requested PA/ZC from PWS and RC to EFU and conceptual
future expansion would contribute to a healthy economy in the County and the larger region for
the reasons detailed in the Economic Impact Report (Attachment A) and summarized below:

           Cost of disposal. Hauling waste to any of the three alternative disposal sites would
           cause the per-ton cost of disposal to increase for County residents and businesses. The
           annual cost of disposal to the entire County would increase by $3.5 to $5.1 million
           (depending on the alternative site). The increased costs are caused by the additional cost
           of managing waste at a transfer station and hauling the waste to the alternative sites.
           Fees to Yamhill County. If Riverbend Landfill expands, RLC would continue to pay
           licensing and host fees to the County. Under a new licensing agreement approved in
           2012, it is estimated these fees will provide more than $1.2 million in annual revenue to
           the County. That revenue supports about two-thirds of the County's Solid Waste Fund
           budgeted expenses, and pays for post-closure costs of the closed landfills in the County,

31
  Goal 9 applies only to urban and unincorporated lands inside UGBs. See OAR 660-009-0010(1). Planning for industrial
and commercial uses outside of UGBs is not required or restricted by LCDC's rule implementing Goal 9.

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                                      Page 41
Riverbend Landfill                                                                                     September 2013
           solid waste education programs, household hazardous collection, and other programs. If
           Riverbend Landfill closes, the County would no longer collect licensing and host fees
           from RLC. Instead, the County would collect license fees from a new transfer station,
           estimated to be between $64,000 and $94,000 per year.
           Employment and income from construction. RLC will spend approximately $25.5
           million to expand Riverbend Landfill. The construction activity will generate 202 jobs
           directly associated with construction activities and $6.1 million in associated personal
           income. The construction activity will generate secondary jobs and income impacts, as
           the construction and its employees purchase goods and services in the local economy. In
           total, construction of the expansion will generate 263 jobs and $7.7 million in associated
           income. Under the alternative disposal scenarios, a $2 million transfer station will be
           constructed, creating 29 jobs (23 or which are directly associated with construction
           activities) and $869,000 in associated income.
           Employment and income from operations. Operating Riverbend Landfill currently
           requires 17 full-time equivalent jobs, generating $1.6 million in associated personal
           income per year. Operating Riverbend Landfill yields secondary jobs, as the landfill and
           its employees purchase goods and services in the local economy. It is estimated that
           operating Riverbend Landfill generates 19 secondary jobs and $500,000 in personal
           income, for a total of 36 jobs and $2.1 million in personal income. Hauling waste to
           alternative sites would create between 14 and 19 jobs, associated with operating the
           transfer station and transporting the waste to alternative sites, and would generate
           between $900,000 and $1.2 million in personal income (depending on the alternative
           site). Between 11 and 14 of those jobs would be directly employed in transfer station
           operations and hauling the waste.
           Electricity generation. RLC is currently generating and selling electricity to
           McMinnville Water and Light by combusting landfill gas. The landfill gas from
           Riverbend Landfill creates a capacity of 4.8 megawatts, enough to power about 2,500
           Oregon homes. Expanding Riverbend Landfill would extend electricity generation over a
           longer time period.
           Air emissions from hauling waste. Hauling solid waste from the County to any of the
           three alternative disposal sites generates carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx),
           carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter. Expanding Riverbend Landfill avoids the
           generation of transportation-related greenhouse gases and pollutants that decrease air
           quality. The economic costs of the increased pollutant emissions are between $28,000
           and $297,000 per year for CO2, between $23,000 and $200,000 per year for NOx; and
           between $28,000 and $242,000 per year for particulate matter.
           Green Technology facility. RLC is exploring development of a Green Technology
           facility in the Future Expansion Area. The specific facility RLC is pursuing would

           generate a fuel source that emits less carbon than coal per BTU of energy generated and
           have the following economic benefits:

                Construction of the facility would generate an estimated 89 jobs directly associated
                with constructing the facility and $2.8 million in personal income. The construction
                activity and its workers would create additional jobs and income by purchasing local
                goods and services, creating a total of 110 temporary jobs and $3.4 million in
                personal income.
                Operating the facility would generate an estimated 43 jobs directly associated with
                operating the facility and hauling the material to a port and $3.8 million in personal
                income, per year. The facility and its employees would generate additional jobs and
                income by purchasing local goods and services, creating a total of 88 permanent jobs
                and $5.0 million in personal income, per year.
                The facility would reduce total CO2 emissions by about 33,000 metric tons per year,
                which has an economic value between $1.3 million and $3.7 million.
           While it is Waste Management's vision to construct and operate this green technology
           facility at Riverbend Landfill, the construction of any particular facility depends on many
           factors including; proven commercialization of the technology, financial viability of the
           project, and ability to receive all necessary permits within the current the regulatory
           structure.
The Yamhill County SWMP includes the following discussion of the importance of Riverbend
Landfill to County businesses and industries:32

       Having a modern landfill facility to serve the County is a valuable resource. Locating a new
       landfill in the County is not an easy task, if that approach was selected. Therefore one
       consideration is to evaluate how to maximize the resource that is currently in place.

       The primary advantage of maximizing the capacity of Riverbend Landfill includes
       maintaining a convenient disposal site for less than $30 per ton. Providing this low cost
       disposal capacity significantly impacts costs for several major industrial customers in the
       area and helps these businesses remain competitive in the market place. Many other
       communities pay in excess of $60 per ton to transport and dispose of waste at distant
       landfills. As such there is no additional transfer station or long-haul costs. Another key
       advantage is the revenue derived from the host fees as a result of operating a regional
       disposal site.

RLC recognizes that tourism is a key component of the County's economy. As described in the
Economic Impact Report, a review of prior studies on tourism in the County yielded no
evidence suggesting Riverbend Landfill negatively impacts County tourism. Yamhill County is

Riverbend Landfill                                                                            September 2013
the leading production area for Oregon's wine industry, and several studies have identified wine-
related tourism as the main driver of tourism activities in the County. Analyses by Full Glass
Research (2011) and Barney & Worth, Inc. (2009) both recognize several key factors that could
affect the growth of wine-related tourism in the County, although neither points to Riverbend
Landfill nor other waste disposal operations as deterrents of tourism growth. The record
demonstrates that Riverbend Landfill has been in operation during the entire time that the wine
and tourism industries have developed and continued to thrive in the County.

The Economic Impact Report compared the tourism industry in the County to that of other
comparable counties in Oregon, Washington and California. These counties are either similar in
size to Yamhill County, or are also known for their wine-related tourism and wine production.
Figure 1 of the report shows the average annual growth rate of tourism-related spending in the
County and comparable counties from 2000 to 2009. Of these counties, Yamhill County ranked
in the top ten in terms of destination spending by tourists over this time period.

This PA/ZC proposal includes rezoning approximately 25 acres of Tax Lot 401 from RC to
EFU. RLC owns this tax lot and it has been leased and operated as a 90-space RV park. Tax
Lot 401 is identified as part of the Future Expansion Area. The operators of the RV park report
that the facility's total annual revenue is $125,000 per year. It has no paid employees. If
Riverbend Landfill is expanded, the Mulkey RV park will no longer generate that revenue. It is
likely that some of its customers will go to other RV parks or campsites within the County. The
economic impact of closing the RV park is therefore likely to be less than $125,000 per year.

A total of 315 acres are currently zoned RC in the County (2013 geographic information system
[GIS] Data). Zoned RC sites include but are not limited to RV parks, golf courses, and the
Flying M Ranch. In 2006, the County rezoned 85 acres (Riverwood Golf Course ­ PAZ-05-06)
from RC to EFU after the golf course closed. Approval of this PA/ZC would reduce the
County's inventory of RC zoned land by 25 acres and the conceptual future expansion would
replace the existing RV park. However, on balance, the economic benefits associated with this
PA/ZC and future expansion outweigh the economic/tourism benefits associated with the
existing RV park in the context of jobs, capital investment, and fees to the County.

As a component of the Yamhill County Agri-Business Plan (2009), consultants completed an
analysis of zoning for potential prototype developments in the County. The analysis concluded
that the RC zone permits several prototype uses (including resorts, bed & breakfast inn, and
wine center). However, it did not consider whether adequately sized or located sites are available
for development within specific zoning districts, including the RC District, even though the use
may be allowed.

Riverbend Landfill                                                                     September 2013
The County has already made findings implying that the continued operation of Riverbend
Landfill is consistent with Goal 9. When it adopted the code change in 2011 to allow solid waste
disposal sites within the farm zone, the County concluded:

     The Board finds that the legislative amendment will contribute to a healthy economy in the
     County. The County's Solid Waste Management Plan expressly acknowledges that "[h]aving
     a modern landfill facility to serve the County is a valuable resource." Additionally, the
     record contains multiple studies demonstrating the economic benefits of a local disposal
     option. The legislative amendment will provide lands for the maintenance, enhancement or
     expansion of existing facilities in furtherance of those benefits.

In summary, this PA/ZC and conceptual Future Expansion Area would support the local and
regional economy with the continued availability of good local jobs to operate the landfill, and
additional construction jobs associated with the future expansion and potential development of
the new Green Technology facility. Further economic benefits would include secondary
employment and income to local businesses associated with the expansion and operation of the
landfill, and cost-effective disposal rates for local businesses and industries when compared with
alternative disposal options. Riverbend Landfill is an important and vital part of the County
economy and approval of the PA/ZC to allow an application for future expansion is consistent
with the intent of Goal 9.

J. Goal 10 - Housing
     To provide for the housing needs of citizens of the state.

Response: Goal 10 requires that local governments do their fair share to provide for the
housing needs of people of all income levels. Under Goal 10, cities must inventory buildable
lands for residential use and encourage the availability of adequate numbers of needed housing
units at price ranges and rent levels that are commensurate with the financial capabilities of
Oregon households.

Buildable lands are defined in Goal 10 as lands inside urban growth boundaries that are suitable,
available, and necessary for residential use. Therefore, Goal 10 does not apply to the rural lands
that are the subject of this PA/ZC from PWS and RC to EFU. The conceptual future expansion
(which will require subsequent Site Design Review approval) would not affect any lands that are
zoned for rural residential use or displace any existing housing units.

K. Goal 11 ­ Public Facilities and Services
     To plan and develop a timely, orderly and efficient arrangement of public facilities and
     services to serve as a framework for urban and rural development.

Response: Goal 11 provides that urban and rural development should be guided and supported
by types and levels of services appropriate for, but limited to, the needs and requirements of the

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                           Page 45
Riverbend Landfill                                                                          September 2013
urban and rural areas to be served. Goal 11 is implemented through the Public Facilities
Planning Rule, OAR 660, and Division 11. Under Oregon's land use planning framework, cities
have the lead role in preparing and adopting public facility plans for sanitary sewer and water
facilities to support planned land uses within urban growth boundaries.

Goal 11 includes a specific reference to planning for landfills, and as noted, the existence of a
local landfill is a key component of the County's SWMP, which cities in the County rely on as
part of their own planning efforts implementing Goal 11.

Riverbend Landfill serves customers of urban and rural areas. Neither the existing landfill nor
the conceptual future expansion would require city water or sewer service or other urban public
facilities. Under state statutes and administrative rules, a solid waste disposal site is identified as a
use that may be permitted in EFU and forest zones. Additionally, ORS Chapter 459 gives
counties the authority to establish a coordinated solid waste program. Because the counties
manage rural land uses and a solid waste landfill is identified as a use that may be allowed in rural
resource zones, it is reasonable to categorize a landfill as a rural use. All of the regional landfills
in Oregon are located in rural zones.

 Planning for a solid waste management system is similar to planning for other large
infrastructure projects such as wastewater treatment plants, water storage reservoirs, freeways, or
power plants. Such projects are critical elements of an integrated infrastructure system. Localized
impacts of larger facilities must be mitigated and balanced with broader County needs and
benefits. The broader service area that benefits by access to a regional landfill in the County
contributes additional financial resources to the County's solid waste management program ­
including recycling and waste recovery programs ­ that would otherwise be dependent on the
County general fund.

To balance localized impacts with the larger need for such facilities, the County has imposed
surcharges and host fees associated with operation of Riverbend Landfill as a regional landfill.
Historically, these fees have generated substantial annual revenue (more than $500,000 per year)
to the County. In 2012, the County approved a new licensing agreement with RLC that is
expected to increase annual revenues to the County from about $500,000 per year to more than
$1.2 million per year. This increase is driven by a new arrangement that has RLC paying the
County significantly more for waste that it accepts from outside of the county. The revenue
supports about two-thirds of the County's Solid Waste Fund budgeted expenses, including post-
closure costs associated with monitoring the two closed, County-owned landfills, County-wide
education programs to support recycling and waste reduction, and special events such as
household hazardous waste collection.



Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                            Page 46

In summary, the County has adopted a SWMP that addresses near and long-term disposal
requirements as conceptual by Goal 11 and state statutes. Continued operation and potential
future expansion of Riverbend Landfill to meet long-term disposal needs was clearly identified as
an alternative in the adopted SWMP. Because MSW landfills are identified as a permitted non-
farm use in EFU zones, it is clear that Oregon's land use planning framework considers rural
areas an appropriate location for a solid waste disposal site. Therefore, the proposed PA/ZC
and conceptual future expansion is consistent with Goal 11 and would meet current and long-
range needs for continued availability of a solid waste disposal site to serve urban and rural
development in the County.

L. Goal 12 ­ Transportation
     To provide and encourage a safe, convenient and economic transportation system.

Response: An amendment to an acknowledged comprehensive plan must put into place
measures required by the Transportation Planning Rule to "assure that allowed uses are
consistent with the identified function, capacity, and performance standards (e.g., level of
service, volume to capacity ratio etc.) of the facility." OAR 660-012-0060.

Lancaster Engineering prepared a Traffic Impact Study to analyze the potential transportation
impacts associated with the PA/ZC to EFU and the conceptual future expansion and to address
the requirements of the Transportation Planning Rule (TPR). See Attachment B.

Oregon Highway 18 is under the jurisdiction of ODOT and is classified as a Statewide Highway
Route. The highway is on the National Highway System, and it is designated as a State Freight
Route, a Truck Route, as well as an expressway. It is generally a two-lane roadway with a
statutory rural highway speed limit of 55 miles per hour (mph). The facility has wide paved
shoulders in the vicinity of the zone change/Future Expansion Area.

The landfill only has one access to Highway 18 located at milepost 41.56. Due to the largely rural
location, no major street intersections are present near the zone change/Future Expansion Area
that would require analysis of site impacts. The Traffic Impact Study includes an analysis of
projected traffic impacts during the weekday morning and evening peak hours as well as the
Saturday peak for the intersection of the site access and Highway 18.

The existing access to the landfill will be maintained. The southwest-bound approach has a
through lane and a dedicated left-turn lane, whereas the northbound approach has a through
lane and a dedicated right-turn lane. The site has a shared lane for all turning movements that is
wide enough to accommodate a right and left-turning vehicle simultaneously. There is adequate
sight distance for entering and exiting vehicles at the landfill entrance to meet current ODOT
standards.

Assumptions regarding trip generation are detailed in the Traffic Impact Study (see Attachment
B) and summarized below:

           The PA/ZC is needed to provide the opportunity for a future expansion. Therefore, it is
           reasonable to assume that the Future Expansion Area is unlikely to be developed with a
           more intensive use than what is currently proposed (landfill expansion, Green
           Technology facility, operations & support areas).
           RLC is assuming 510,000 tons per year for a baseline inbound waste quantity to the
           landfill (without new technology) and has not applied an annual growth rate over the life
           of the site. Disposal quantities over the past five years have averaged about 570,000 tons
           per year. RLC expects projected tonnage to remain flat based on WM diversion of
           certain wastes to other facilities, and development of community waste-reduction
           programs that will continue to offset growth of disposal volumes in the future.
           Therefore, the Traffic Impact Study could have assumed no change in trip generation
           associated with the landfill. However, to be conservative, the Traffic Impact Study
           applied a growth factor using forecasted traffic volumes along Highway 18 in front of
           the site over the planning period (1.7 percent/year).
           To account for the potential future Green Technology facility, information from RLC
           was used to derive a trip generation. The envisioned Green Technology facility would
           divert a portion of the waste stream and convert that waste into a solid product that
           could be combusted and used as an alternative energy source. The facility would be
           operated by approximately 35 employees split into two shifts per day, seven days a week.
           To maintain a conservative, worst-case analysis, it was assumed that the envisioned
           Green Technology facility would change shifts during each of the peak hours and that
           100 percent of the energy product would be shipped out as new truck loads, with no
           back-hauling by existing trucks.
The analysis shows that impacts associated with the PA/ZC and conceptual future expansion
would result in worst case projected traffic volumes in 2030 well below the capacity of Highway
18, and otherwise within the acceptable standards set by ODOT. Projected traffic volumes in
2030 (background traffic plus site traffic) would result in a worst case volume-to-capacity
("v/c") ratio of 0.12 for the site peak hour, which is well below the acceptable v/c ratio of 0.70
set by ODOT. Therefore, the proposed PA/ZC and conceptual future expansion does not
"significantly affect" Highway 18 for the following reasons:

           The PA/ZC does not change the functional classification of Highway 18;
           At the end of the 20-year planning period, the PA/ZC and conceptual future expansion
           does not allow land uses or levels of development that result in types or levels of travel
           or access that are inconsistent with the functional classification of Highway 18; and

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                          Page 48
Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
           The PA/ZC does not reduce the performance of Highway 18 and is within the
           minimum acceptable performance standard (v/c ratio of 0.70) identified by ODOT for
           this facility.
Because the plan map amendment does not significantly affect Highway 18 based on the criteria
outlined in OAR 660-012-0060, no special measures are required to assure that the allowed uses
are consistent with the identified function, capacity, and performance standards for Highway 18.

In summary, the Traffic Impact Study documents that RLC has and would continue to provide
safe and convenient access to the Riverbend Landfill in compliance with ODOT access, safety,
and level of service standards for Highway 18. The proposed PA/ZC and conceptual future
expansion would not significantly affect Highway 18 as defined by the TPR.

M. Goal 13 ­ Energy Conservation
     To conserve energy.

Response: Goal 13 directs cities and counties to manage and control land uses to maximize the
conservation of all forms of energy, based on sound economic principles. Goal 13 planning and
implementation guidelines include two references to solid waste systems:

     Planning Guideline 5: Plans directed toward energy conservation within the planning area
     should consider as a major determinant the existing and potential capacity of the renewable
     energy sources to yield useful energy output. Renewable energy sources include water,
     sunshine, wind, geothermal heat and municipal, forest and farm waste. Whenever possible,
     land conservation and development actions provided for under such plans should utilize
     renewable energy sources.

     Implementation Guideline: Land use plans should be based on utilization of techniques and
     implementation devices which can have a material impact on energy efficiency, including
     systems and incentives for the collection, reuse and recycling of metallic and nonmetallic
     wastes.

Decomposition of waste in landfills generates methane gas, which is increasingly recognized as a
valuable renewable energy source that can be converted to useful energy output. RLC
traditionally used a gas flare to combust methane gas generated at Riverbend Landfill. With the
construction of a $10 million energy plant in 2011, Riverbend now has the capacity to generate
4.8 megawatts of electricity in collaboration with McMinnville Water and Light, enough to
power 2,500 local homes.

The continued operation and future expansion of Riverbend Landfill maximizes energy
conservation relative to the alternative of shipping waste to regional landfills located outside of
the County. Riverbend Landfill is centrally located to serve residents and businesses located



Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                           Page 49
Riverbend Landfill                                                                        September 2013
throughout the County. By contrast, potential alternative disposal sites are located from about 40
miles (Coffin Butte) to almost 200 miles (Columbia Ridge) from McMinnville.

Hauling waste to alternative landfill sites would require more fuel for transportation and
generate increased air emissions as heavy trucks travel the longer distances.33 The energy
potential contained in solid waste will exist no matter where the waste ultimately is disposed;
however, that potential is off-set to some degree by any energy used to transport the waste.
Therefore, the most energy-efficient disposal scenario is the option that keeps the waste as close
to its origin as possible.

RLC is also exploring the opportunity of including a Green Technology in the Future Expansion
Area. One potential Green Technology facility would take waste that is currently delivered to
Riverbend Landfill and first sort it before disposal. The portion of the waste stream that is
diverted from the Riverbend Landfill would be processed into fuel pellets, which can be used to
generate energy. The primary market for the fuel pellets is expected to be facilities that require
fuel to create a commodity, such as a cement kiln. Appendix 3 includes background information
on this envisioned Green Technology option.

As summarized in the Economic Impacts Report (see Attachment A), it is estimated that the
potential Green Technology facility at Riverbend Landfill would generate 170,000 tons of
marketable product annually. This would yield 3.145 trillion BTUs of energy annually. It is
estimated that it would require 122,636 tons of coal per year to produce the same volume of
energy.

Based on the foregoing, approval of the PA/ZC to EFU to accommodate the conceptual Future
Expansion Area would provide the greatest opportunity to conserve energy associated with
transporting solid waste. RLC is centrally located to sources of waste generation. RLC has
already constructed the gas-to-energy facility and is pursuing an opportunity for the
development of a Green Technology facility that could convert waste to an energy product and
reduce residual disposal volumes. This integrated approach to managing solid waste and energy
resources is consistent with the objective of Goal 13 "to conserve energy."

Riverbend Landfill                                                                     September 2013
N. Goal 14 ­ Urbanization
     To provide for an orderly and efficient transition from rural to urban land use, to
     accommodate urban population and urban employment inside urban growth boundaries, to
     ensure efficient use of land, and to provide for livable communities.

Response: Goal 14 is a key statewide planning goal in Oregon's overall land use planning
framework. Goal 14 requires that each city coordinate with the respective County to adopt an
UGB to meet 20-year land needs for housing, employment, and livability.

Each of the 10 incorporated cities within the County has coordinated with the County to adopt
and update urban growth boundaries to meet the requirements of Goal 14. The initial UGBs for
the cities in the County were established in the early 1980s to meet population and employment
needs to the year 2000. McMinnville and Newberg have pursued major planning projects to
update land needs and proposed related UGB expansions.

None of the cities in the County have planned for the location of a solid waste disposal site
within their respective UGB's and cities are not required to consider solid waste disposal
facilities as part of their urban land needs. Because solid waste disposal sites are a permitted use
under state law in the statutory EFU zone, it is clear that the use is considered "rural" instead of
"urban." Many components of the solid waste system in the County are appropriately located
inside UGB's, including but not limited to transfer stations, recycling depots, and processing
facilities. However, the franchised haulers for the cities and rural areas of the County (Recology-
Western Oregon and Waste Management) take all of their residual solid waste to Riverbend
Landfill for disposal.

The established solid waste collection, transfer, and disposal system in the County provides an
efficient and cost-effective system for residents and businesses in both the urban and rural areas
of the County. Approval of the requested PA/ZC and conceptual future expansion will maintain
a needed land use at an appropriate location on a large site that can be adequately separated and
buffered from surrounding rural and nearby urban uses, consistent with the intent of Goal 14.

O. Goal 15 ­ Willamette River Greenway
     To protect, conserve, enhance, and maintain the natural, scenic, historical, agricultural,
     economic, and recreational qualities of lands along the Willamette River as the Willamette
     River Greenway.

Response: The RLC tax lots included in the PA/ZC as shown in Figure 1 are not within the
Willamette River Greenway boundary. Therefore, Goal 15 is not applicable to the PA/ZC or
conceptual Future Expansion Area.

IV.        Compliance with the Yamhill County Comprehensive
           Plan
With the adoption of Senate Bill 100 in 1973, the Oregon Legislature:

     1. Set the framework for a comprehensive and coordinated land use planning program;
     2. Established the LCDC; and
     3. Directed each city and county in the state to prepare and adopt comprehensive plans and
        implement ordinances consistent with statewide planning goals which were to be
        adopted by LCDC by 1975.
The County embarked on an extensive public outreach and coordination process and adopted its
first Yamhill County Comprehensive Plan (Plan) in 1974, prior to adoption of the statewide
planning goals. The Plan was updated in 1979 and goal and policy statements, which form the
basis of the Plan, were reviewed and revised as needed to comply with the requirements of the
statewide planning goals and ORS 197. The County was the first county in the Willamette Valley
to receive acknowledgement from LCDC that its plan complied with the statewide planning
goals.

The Plan addresses seven broad areas: 1) Urban Growth and Change and Economic
Development; 2) Land and Water; 3) Transportation, Communications, and Public Utilities; 4)
Public Land, Facilities, and Services; 5) Environmental Quality; 6) Energy Conservation; and 7)
Implementation, Evaluation, and Review.

Findings in this section of the application narrative describe why the proposed PA/ZC and
conceptual future expansion is consistent with relevant goals and policies in the Plan. Goals and
policies are addressed according to the topics and sequence noted above. Adopted goal and
policy language is presented in italic type, followed by responses that explain why the proposed
PA/ZC is consistent with the cited goal and/or policy.

A. Section I ­ Urban Growth and Change and Economic Development
1. Urban Area Development
     Goal 1: To encourage the containment of growth within existing urban centers, provide for
     the orderly, staged, diversified and compatible development of all of the cities of Yamhill
     County, and assure an efficient transition from rural to urban land use.

Response: The existing landfill is recognized as a rural use and has operated under County and
DEQ land use and permit approvals for more than 30 years. Operation of the landfill does not
require urban sewer or water facilities or other urban infrastructure. Residential, commercial,

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                           Page 52
Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
industrial, and institutional land uses within the cities of the County are provided with solid
waste collection and recycling services by franchised haulers. All residual wastes generated in the
County are transported to Riverbend Landfill for disposal.

Approval of the PA/ZC would provide the opportunity for RLC to submit a Site Design
Review application for the conceptual Future Expansion Area and ensure the continued
availability of an efficient and cost-effective disposal site to serve the cities of the County,
consistent with Goal 1 for Urban Area Development. This PA/ZC proposal does not
compromise the stated goal to contain urban growth within existing urban centers and to ensure
an efficient transition from rural to urban land use. Riverbend Landfill is located about 2 miles
southwest of the McMinnville UGB and a solid waste disposal site is recognized as a permitted
non-farm use in the rural area under Goal 3 (Agricultural Lands).

     Policy C: Yamhill County will recognize the lands within established urban growth
     boundaries as the appropriate and desired location for urban development.

Response: Because landfills typically require large sites and are not dependent on urban
infrastructure, such as public sewer and water, the use is more appropriately categorized as a
rural rather than an urban use. Therefore, a location outside of established urban growth
boundaries is the more appropriate and desired location for MSW landfills (all of Oregon's
larger, active landfills are located outside urban areas). This assumption is consistent with the
statutory assignment for solid waste planning to counties rather than cities. Additionally, solid
waste disposal sites are listed as a permitted use in the statutory EFU zone. Other components
of the solid waste management system, such as recycling facilities and transfer stations, are
appropriate urban uses that are often allowed in industrial zones and/or inside of urban growth
boundaries. Therefore, approval of the PA/ZC to allow an application for the conceptual future
expansion of Riverbend Landfill in the EFU zone is consistent with Policy C.

     Goal 2: To encourage the containment of urban services and facilities and other public
     capital improvements within existing urbanizing areas in order to achieve an orderly pattern
     of urban growth.

Response: Approval of the PA/ZC will allow RLC to submit an application for future
expansion of Riverbend Landfill. The existing landfill operates with rural services and facilities at
a rural location about 2 miles from McMinnville's UGB. The extension of urban services and
facilities and other public capital improvements will not be required or allowed to serve the
PA/ZC area or conceptual Future Expansion Area. Therefore, approval of the PA/ZC to allow
continuation of the established use is consistent with the stated goal to contain urban services
and facilities within existing urbanizing areas.




Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                         Page 53
Riverbend Landfill                                                                        September 2013
     Policy A: Yamhill County will continue to seek full cooperation and coordination among the
     cities, the school districts, other special-purpose districts of the county and the county itself
     in jointly planning and programming all land use, urban services and facilities and other
     public improvements having an impact on the rate and direction of urban growth.

Response: The County cooperated with the 10 cities in the County and the franchised haulers
in the preparation and adoption of the 2004 SWMP. The cities have deferred the lead role in
solid waste planning to the County, and the County has the lead role in the land use permitting
and license agreement for solid waste disposal. Riverbend Landfill has operated at this rural
location for more than 30 years without impact on the rate and direction of urban growth.
However, all of the urban areas in the County expect and depend on regular and convenient
pickup of solid waste and recyclables, and recognize the importance of a centrally located and
cost-effective disposal site to accommodate long-term disposal of residual waste. During the
course of the County's review of RLC's 2008 PA/ZC application, the County updated its
SWMP. The updated SWMP included the County's hiring of a consultant to analyze various
disposal options in the event Riverbend Landfill ceased operating in the County in 2014 (JR
Miller Report). Based in part on the information developed through the update of the SWMP,
the County found that continued operation of a local landfill was necessary to meet the County's
solid waste disposal needs.

2. Rural Area Development
     Goal 1: To provide an adequate amount of land, development areas and sites to
     accommodate those uses which are customarily found in rural areas or require or are better
     suited to rural locations, without compromising the basic goal relating to urban containment
     and orderly urban development.

Response: As described above, solid waste landfills are recognized under state and county
policies and rules as a use that is appropriate and better suited to rural locations. Prior to the
opening of Riverbend Landfill in the early 1980s, the Whiteson and Newberg Landfills also
operated in rural areas, as did the majority of the smaller landfills that operated throughout
Oregon, prior to the adoption of Federal Subtitle D regulations.

Under Oregon's planning framework, a solid waste disposal facility is a use that is allowed by
Goal 3 and the statutory EFU zone and is now also allowed in the County's EFU zone.
Approval of the PA/ZC to EFU would provide the opportunity for RLC to submit an
application to expand the established rural use onto suitable contiguous lands. Approval of this
PA/ZC would not compromise the basic goal relating to urban containment and orderly urban
development because the landfill is an established rural use at this location and recognized as a
permitted nonfarm use in the EFU zone.

3. City Growth and Development
       Policy A: All urban growth boundaries in the county will be delineated as shown on the plan
       map and no extension of urban land uses or city water and sewer services beyond the
       designated urban growth boundaries will be undertaken without concurrent amendments to
       both the respective city and county comprehensive plans.

Response: Riverbend Landfill is located about 2 miles southwest of the McMinnville UGB. The
landfill has operated at this location for more than 30 years without city water and sewer
services, and the PA/ZC and conceptual Future Expansion Areas would not require urban
services. Therefore, approval of the PA/ZC is consistent with the adopted policy relating to city
growth and development.

4. Economic Development
       Goal 1: To maintain a rate and pattern of economic growth sufficient to prevent recurring
       high levels of unemployment and under-employment in the county, balance the real property
       tax base of the various cities, and strengthen local economic bases.

Response: The discussion and findings in Section III relating to Statewide Planning Goal 9 are
relevant to the goal and policies relating to Economic Development. The Statewide Goal 9
findings and discussion are incorporated here by this reference.

Continued operation of Riverbend as a regional landfill would provide many economic benefits
to residents, businesses, and public agencies within the County. Approval of the PA/ZC will
provide the opportunity for RLC to submit a future application to expand Riverbend. Key
benefits of the conceptual future expansion are described in the report prepared by
ECONorthwest34 and are highlighted below.

            Cost of disposal. Hauling waste to any of the three alternative disposal sites would
            cause the per-ton cost of disposal to increase for the County residents and businesses.
            The annual cost of disposal to the entire County would increase by $3.5 to $5.1 million
            (depending on the alternative site). The increased costs are caused by the additional cost
            of managing waste at a transfer station and hauling the waste to the alternative sites.
            Fees to Yamhill County. If Riverbend landfill expands, RLC would continue to pay
            licensing and host fees to the County. Under a new licensing agreement approved in
            2012, it is estimated these fees will provide more than $1.2 million in annual revenue to
            the County. That revenue supports about two-thirds of the County's Solid Waste Fund
            budgeted expenses, and pays for post-closure costs of closed landfills, solid waste
            education programs, household hazardous collection, and other programs. If Riverbend
            closes, the County would no longer collect licensing and host fees from Riverbend, but it

Riverbend Landfill                                                                              September 2013
           would collect license fees from a new transfer station, estimated to be between $64,000
           and $94,000 per year.
           Employment and income from construction. RLC will spend approximately $25.5
           million to expand Riverbend. The construction activity will generate 202 jobs directly
           associated with construction activities and $6.1 million in associated personal income.
           The construction activity will generate secondary jobs and income impacts, as the
           construction and its employees purchase goods and services in the local economy. In
           total, construction of the expansion will generate 263 jobs and $7.7 million in associated
           income. Under the alternative disposal scenarios, a $2 million transfer station will be
           constructed, creating 29 jobs (23 or which are directly associated with construction
           activities) and $869,000 in associated income.
           Employment and income from operations. Operating Riverbend Landfill currently
           requires 17 full-time equivalent jobs, generating $1.6 million in associated personal
           income per year. Operating Riverbend Landfill yields secondary jobs, as the landfill and
           its employees purchase goods and services in the local economy. It is estimated that
           operating Riverbend Landfill generates 19 secondary jobs and $500,000 in personal
           income, for a total of 36 jobs and $2.1 million in personal income. Hauling waste to
           alternative sites would create between 14 and 19 jobs, associated with operating the
           transfer station and transporting the waste to alternative sites, and would generate
           between $900,000 and $1.2 million in personal income (depending on the alternative
           site). Between 11 and 14 of those jobs would be directly employed in transfer station
           operations and hauling the waste.
           Electricity generation. RLC is currently generating and selling electricity to
           McMinnville Water and Light by combusting landfill gas. The landfill gas from
           Riverbend Landfill creates a capacity of 4.8 megawatts, enough to power about 2,500
           Oregon homes. Expanding Riverbend Landfill would extend electricity generation over a
           longer time period.
           Air emissions from hauling waste. Hauling solid waste from the County to any of the
           three alternative disposal sites generates CO2, NOx, CO, and particulate matter.
           Expanding Riverbend avoids the generation of transportation-related greenhouse gases
           and pollutants that decrease air quality. The economic costs of the increased pollutant
           emissions are between $28,000 and $297,000 per year for CO2, between $23,000 and
           $200,000 per year for NOx; and between $28,000 and $242,000 per year for particulate
           matter.
           Green Technology facility. RLC is exploring development of a Green Technology
           facility in the Future Expansion Area. The specific facility RLC is pursuing would
           generate a fuel source that emits less carbon than coal per BTU of energy generated and
           have the following economic benefits:

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                         Page 56
Riverbend Landfill                                                                        September 2013
                Construction of the envisioned facility would generate an estimated 89 jobs directly
                associated with constructing the facility and $2.8 million in personal income. The
                construction activity and its workers would create additional jobs and income by
                purchasing local goods and services, creating a total of 110 temporary jobs and $3.4
                million in personal income.
                Operating the envisioned facility would generate an estimated 43 jobs directly
                associated with operating the facility and hauling the material to a port and $3.8
                million in personal income, per year. The envisioned facility and its employees would
                generate additional jobs and income by purchasing local goods and services, creating
                a total of 88 permanent jobs and $5.0 million in personal income, per year.
                The envisioned facility would reduce total CO2 emissions by about 33,000 metric
                tons per year, which has an economic value between $1.3 million and $3.7 million.
           While it is Waste Management's vision to construct and operate this green technology
           facility at Riverbend Landfill, the construction of any particular facility depends on many
           factors including; proven commercialization of the technology, financial viability of the
           project, and ability to receive all necessary permits within the current the regulatory
           structure.
The existing landfill is an integral part of the overall solid waste management system in the
County and the long-term availability of a centrally located disposal site with competitive rates
would help to maintain the stability and encourage the development of the local economy
consistent with Goal 1.

     Policy A: Yamhill County will, in cooperation with the cities, the local chambers of
     commerce and affiliated industrial promotion groups, and State agencies concerned with
     State and regional economic development, encourage a diversified employment base, the
     strengthening of trade centers, and the attraction of both capital and labor-intensive
     enterprises, consistent with the needs of each community and the county as a whole.

Response: Riverbend Landfill provides a stable source of family-wage jobs and represents a
multi-million dollar capital investment. Continued operation and conceptual future expansion
would generate a substantially larger capital investment and more construction jobs relative to
the most likely alternative of transporting County waste to out-of-County landfills. Multiple
jurisdictions, businesses and business organizations within Yamhill County have recognized that
continued operation of Riverbend Landfill as a regional landfill would provide economic
development benefits to the County.

     Policy B: Yamhill County will encourage economic development projects which do not
     conflict with the predominant timber and agricultural character of the county.

Response: The discussion in Section III relating to Goal 3 (Agricultural Land), Goal 6 (Air,
Water and Land Resources Quality) and Goal 9 (Economic Development) are relevant to Policy
B. The discussion and findings in those sections are incorporated here by this reference.

Riverbend Landfill is appropriately considered an infrastructure project that supports economic
development. The predominant timber areas of the County are generally located at higher
elevations in the westerly portion of the County toward the Coast Range. There are no parcels in
the immediate vicinity (1-mile radius) of the existing landfill that are designated and zoned for
Commercial Forestry. However, the landfill is located in a productive agricultural area of the
County and many properties in the vicinity of the landfill are managed for commercial farm uses.

When considering potential uses that conflict with agricultural uses, the typical concern relates to
rural residential development. Accepted farm practices can include activities such as application
of pesticides and fertilizers, operation of noisy equipment, dust and odors, and slow moving
farm machinery on rural roads. Oregon's land use planning program has focused on restricting
non-farm uses and dwellings in agricultural areas to avoid conflicts with farm practices.
Additionally, ORS 215.283(2) and the associated administrative rule for Agricultural Land (OAR
660, Division 33) specifically list the following uses that may be authorized on agricultural lands:

           A site for the disposal of solid waste that has been ordered to be established by the
           Environmental Quality Commission under ORS 459.049, together with the equipment,
           facilities, or buildings necessary for its operation.
           A site for the disposal of solid waste approved by the governing body of a city or County
           or both and for which a permit has been granted under ORS 459.245 by DEQ together
           with equipment, facilities or buildings necessary for its operation.
Therefore, the state statute and rule clearly consider solid waste landfills as appropriate uses on
agricultural lands, subject to DEQ approval of a solid waste disposal permit. Riverbend Landfill
has operated at this location for more than 30 years in compliance with DEQ Solid Waste
Disposal Permit (SWDP) 345 and with no evidence of conflicts with farm practices. Substantial
buffers are maintained around the active landfill to minimize conflicts with surrounding
agricultural uses. Access to the landfill is provided via a controlled access point from Highway
18 and landfill traffic does not conflict with movement of farm equipment on County roads in
the vicinity.

Natural and human-made boundaries define the proposed PA/ZC and conceptual Future
Expansion Areas. Natural boundaries include waterways/riparian corridors to the north, east
and south. On the west, Highway 18 forms a hard edge to the Future Expansion Area. RLC has

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                        Page 58
Riverbend Landfill                                                                       September 2013
made concerted efforts to operate as a good neighbor to farmers in the vicinity and to avoid and
minimize conflicts with the agricultural character of the County. As described in Section III
findings related to Goal 3, these efforts include practices and programs to manage birds, dust,
and odors, monitor groundwater and surface water quality, and manage other "externalities"
associated with operation of the landfill. DEQ rules require and assure regular and robust
monitoring and adaptive management.

The viability of commercial farm uses in the general vicinity of the landfill, including farmland
employed by the wine industry, has not been diminished by the presence or operation of
Riverbend Landfill. In essence, Riverbend Landfill and the County's vineyard industry have
grown in parallel over the same time period. RLC has demonstrated that it is feasible to balance
the economic development benefits associated with continued operation of the landfill while
maintaining the predominant agricultural character of the vicinity.

B. Section II ­ The Land and Water
1. Agricultural Lands
       Goal 1: To conserve Yamhill County's farm lands for the production of crops and livestock
       and to ensure that conversion of farm land to urban use where necessary and appropriate
       occurs in an orderly and economic manner.

Response: The findings in Section III addressing compliance with Goal 3 are hereby
incorporated by this reference to also address goals and policies in the County plan relating to
agricultural lands.

RLC is sensitive to the importance of conserving high-value County farm lands for the
production of crops and livestock. RLC is not proposing to convert farm land to urban use.
Instead is proposing the PA/ZC to EFU so the existing landfill will be wholly within a farm use
zone, a use that is allowed by Goal 3. Approval of the PA/ZC will provide the opportunity for
RLC to submit a subsequent application for a conceptual future expansion onto EFU land, as
authorized by state law and the County's EFU zone.

The County's adopted SWMP documents that Riverbend Landfill would be filled to capacity by
about 2014. The SWMP emphasizes that it would be important to begin planning for an
appropriate disposal option well in advance of Riverbend Landfill's potential closure to assure
continuity of service and continued stability in the County's integrated solid waste management
system (including collection, transfer, recycling, recovery, and disposal of residual wastes).

The SWMP35 includes the following discussion of continuing disposal at Riverbend Landfill:

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                           Page 59
Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
     Property that Riverbend owns provides potential areas for expansion that may provide an
     additional 10-25 years of disposal capacity at current volumes. There may also be
     opportunity to purchase additional property to expand the site or at least to locate support
     buildings or other features to allow maximum build out of the existing landfill site. Having a
     modern landfill facility to serve the County is a valuable resource. Locating a new landfill in
     the County is not an easy task, if that approach was selected. Therefore, one consideration is
     to evaluate how to maximize the resource that is currently in place.

     The primary advantage of maximizing the capacity of Riverbend Landfill includes
     maintaining a convenient disposal site for less than $30 per ton. Providing this low cost
     disposal capacity significantly impacts costs for several major industrial customers in the
     area and helps these businesses remain competitive in the market place. Many other
     communities pay in excess of $60 per ton to transport and dispose of waste at distant
     landfills. As such, there is no additional transfer station or long-haul costs. Another key
     advantage is the revenue derived from the host fees as a result of operating a regional
     disposal site.

DEQ recently approved construction of a MSE berm within the approved permit area covered
under Riverbend Landfill's SWDP 345. This approval will accommodate an additional one
million cubic yards of waste and extend the life of the existing landfill to approximately 2017
while RLC pursues this PA/ZC and conceptual future expansion on a parallel track.

As shown in Figure 1, RLC is proposing to rezone a total of 243 acres from PWS and RC back
to the original EFU zoning that was in place at this location prior to 1980. This approach is
required because LUBA and the Court of Appeals found that the Goal 2 exceptions process that
RLC and the County followed in 1980, 2002 and 2009 could not be used to allow a use (landfill)
that is authorized under the statutory EFU zone.

In 2009, the County determined there was a demonstrated need for the continued presence of a
landfill in the County. Following the direction provided by LUBA and the Court of Appeals, the
County then amended the text of the County's EFU zone to mirror the statutory use in ORS
215.283(2)(k) and allows solid waste sites to be maintained, enhanced or expanded within the
EFU zone in some, but not all, of the circumstances allowed by state law. The County's EFU
zone now allows that category of use subject to the limitations in ORS 215.296, which requires
specific developments to demonstrate that they do not force a significant change in farm or
forest practices on surrounding lands. Such changes are subject to approval through the
County's Site Design Review process, which addresses the compatibility of a specific
development with surrounding land uses.

While the comprehensive plan limits the amount of farmland conversion that takes place, it
nevertheless considers that some non-farm rural development will occur. For example, the
comprehensive plan has specific policies relating to urban expansion (Section I.D) as well as
rural residential uses (Section I.B, policy 2.b). Additionally, because solid waste disposal sites are

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                            Page 60
Riverbend Landfill                                                                           September 2013
specifically authorized as a permitted use in the statutory EFU zone, and now the County's EFU
zone, the state and local planning framework clearly contemplate that it is appropriate and
feasible to balance the need for continued operation of an existing solid waste disposal facility
with conservation of the County's farm lands for the production of crops and livestock.

Yamhill County's amended EFU zone allows the maintenance and expansion of existing
facilities, including Riverbend Landfill, thereby preventing solid waste disposal sites from being
sited in all areas of the County's farmland where they do not currently exist. This fact served as
the basis for the County's express finding that the County's Ordinance "minimizes the overall
non-farm uses allowed in the EFU zone" as required by Goal 3. The continued operation of
Riverbend Landfill also makes use of the opportunity to utilize the nearby RC zone, decreasing
the total amount of EFU land required for any expansion.

Any future expansion would be subject to Site Design Review and will ensure that expansion
occurs in an orderly, efficient and economic manner within defined natural and human-made
boundaries to minimize impacts and conserve farm lands for the production of crops and
livestock.

     Policy A: Yamhill County will provide for the preservation of farm lands through appropriate
     zoning, recognizing comparative economic returns to agriculture and alternative uses,
     changing ownership patterns and management practices, changing market conditions for
     agricultural produce, and various public financial incentives.

Response: RLC recognizes the County's commitment to preserve farm lands through
appropriate zoning. It is important to emphasize that the County designated more than 200
acres at this location for PWS more than 30 years ago to accommodate the landfill operation.
The existing RV park was zoned RC as a "built and committed use." There is no evidence that
the viability of commercial farm uses in the general vicinity of the landfill has been diminished
by the presence or operation of the landfill or the RV park.

As summarized in Section I, the County found in 2009 that there was a need to expand
Riverbend Landfill and approved a consolidated PA/ZC and an exception to Goal 3
(Agricultural Land) to expand the landfill onto a contiguous tract zoned EFU. On appeal, LUBA
reversed the County's decision and concluded that the County could not approve a Goal 3
exception to allow a use that is allowed by Goal 3 and the statutory EFU zone.

The result of LUBA's reversal of the County's decision was that the County could not use the
Goal Exception process to review on a case-by-case basis the siting or expansion of a landfill
and converting EFU land to PWS as it did in 1980, 2004 and 2009. As a consequence, RLC is
now requesting that the County "vacate" the goal exceptions that were authorized for the PWS


Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                         Page 61
Riverbend Landfill                                                                        September 2013
and RC zoning, and return to the EFU zoning that was applied to these parcels prior to
acknowledgement of the county plan.

The existing facilities within the Current Permitted Area shown in Figure 2 have operated in
compliance with County land use and license approvals and the provisions of Riverbend
Landfills DEQ SWDP 345 for more than 30 years. Changing the zoning back to EFU does not
affect the County's policy to preserve farm lands through appropriate zoning because solid waste
disposal sites are listed as a permitted use under the statutory EFU zone and now the County's
EFU zone.

Approval of the PA/ZC to EFU will not constitute approval of a future expansion. RLC will
have to submit a subsequent application for Site Design Review approval, and will have to
comply with the criteria in ORS 215.296 relating to impacts on farm practices and costs, and Site
Design Review criteria that address compatibility with surrounding uses.

Riverbend Landfill has operated as a key component of the County's overall solid waste
management system and has contributed substantial economic benefits to residents, business
and industries and the County. Approval of this PA/ZC is appropriate to provide the
opportunity for RLC to continue to operate in Yamhill County and maintain and enhance the
overall economic benefits of the facility. Approval of this PA/ZC to EFU is consistent with
state law and the County's EFU zone because both authorize solid waste disposal sites as a
permitted non-farm use. Because the County's EFU zone only allows the maintenance and
expansion of existing facilities, it prevents solid waste disposal sites from being established in all
areas of the County's farmland where they do not currently exist. This approach is more
restrictive that state law, minimizes the overall non-farm uses allowed in the EFU zone and
maintains the preservation of farm lands through appropriate zoning.

     Policy B: Yamhill County shall provide for the protection of farmland in large blocks through
     minimum lot sizes of 20, 40, and 80 acres, as appropriate, on the Comprehensive Plan and
     official zoning maps. Any proposal to reduce the minimum lot size on a farm or farm/forest
     parcel shall be shown to be appropriate to maintain the existing commercial agricultural
     enterprise in the area.

Response: This application proposes a PA/ZC to rezone approximately 243 acres currently
zoned PWS and RC back to EFU-80, consistent with the zoning applied to the majority of lands
in the vicinity. The PA/ZC is requested to accommodate an existing use (solid waste disposal
site and ancillary uses) that is expressly permitted under the statutory EFU zone and now
permitted, with limitations, in the County's EFU zone.

RLC is not proposing to reduce the minimum lot size on a farm or farm/forest parcel. This
PA/ZC and conceptual Future Expansion Area are defined by natural and man-made

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                           Page 62
Riverbend Landfill                                                                          September 2013
boundaries on all sides that confine the permitted landfill use from large blocks of farmland
zoned EF-80 to the north, east and south of the South Yamhill River and associated streams,
and to the west of Highway 18.

In addition to the three tax parcels included in this PA/ZC application, RLC owns other parcels
in the vicinity of the landfill. RLC is currently working on a community-based effort to explore
appropriate uses for approximately 450 acres of "Stewardship Lands" that provide a buffer to
the landfill (see Figure 3). The Stewardship Lands are all zoned EF-80, and it is anticipated that
future community uses would maintain and possibly intensify the commercial agricultural
enterprise in the area.

     Policy D: Yamhill County will provide for the conservation of farm lands through various
     plan implementation measures and the review of any public or private land use
     determinations subject to county jurisdiction, including urban development activity and the
     location and construction of highways and utility transmission lines which disturb the soil
     cover and natural drainage pattern, and increase storm runoff, erosion and sedimentation.

Response: The County has the lead role in reviewing and deciding whether the PA/ZC to EFU
is needed and whether potential impacts on agricultural lands can be avoided or mitigated. In
2009, following an extensive and comprehensive review process, the County found that landfill
expansion was needed and reasons sufficient to justify the conversion of farm land to allow the
continued operation of a critical public facility that serves every citizen of the County.

RLC is now requesting to rezone the Current Permitted Area back to EFU since this approach
was specifically articulated by LUBA and the Court of Appeals. Solid waste disposal sites are
expressly authorized in the statutory EFU zone, and the County's EFU zone now allows the
maintenance and expansion of existing facilities.

If the PA/ZC is approved, the County would also have an opportunity to review and approve
site-specific plans for any future expansion through the Site Design Review process. Consistent
with state law, any expansion would have to demonstrate that it would not force a significant
change in farm or forest practices on surrounding lands. Additionally, the Site Design Review
process would address the compatibility of a specific development with surrounding land uses.

DEQ also has a key role in reviewing and approving operational and environmental protections
for the existing landfill and any future expansion to ensure compliance with state and federal
standards and regulations. The operations plan must describe how the operation of the landfill is
in accordance with all regulatory and permit requirements. DEQ's existing SWDP for Riverbend
Landfill defines extensive and rigorous operational, monitoring and reporting requirements
relating to groundwater, surface water, air quality, leachate management, vector management,
and engineering design. DEQ maintains a web page for Riverbend Landfill that provides public

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                           Page 63
Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
access and links to an extensive array of information relevant to Riverbend Landfill and the
DEQ permit.

The County's amended EFU zone allows the maintenance and expansion of existing facilities,
thereby preventing solid waste disposal sites from being sited in all areas of the county's
farmland where they do not currently exist. This approach is more limited than the statutory
EFU zone and serves to minimize the overall non-farm uses allowed in the EFU zone.

In summary, approving the PA/ZC to allow a use that is permitted by state law on EFU land is
consistent with Policy D. Any future expansion would be subject to Site Design Review and
would focus more specifically on landfill operational issues such as soil cover, storm runoff and
erosion control. Additionally, DEQ provides a substantial additional layer of regulatory review
and oversight of specific operating conditions through their permitting process. Under the
County's amended EFU zone, any future expansion would require DEQ permit approval under
ORS 459.245. Because Riverbend operates under a current DEQ SWDP, it is reasonable to
assume that obtaining a permit modification is feasible. Consistent with the two-step process for
Site Design Review outlined in Section 1100 of the YCZO, RLC expects that the County would
conditionally approve a Preliminary Site Development Plan for obtaining the necessary permit
modification from DEQ. The Final Site Development Plan approval for any future expansion
would be contingent on having the DEQ permit approvals in hand.

     Policy H: No proposed rural area development shall substantially impair or conflict with the
     use of farm or forest land, or be justified solely or even primarily on the argument that the
     land is unsuitable for farming or forestry or, due to ownership, is not currently part of an
     economic farming or forestry enterprise.

Response: RLC has not suggested that the requested PA/ZC and conceptual future expansion
should be justified solely or even primarily on the argument that the land is unsuitable for
farming or, due to ownership, is not currently part of an economic farming enterprise.

Policies in the Plan and the SWMP emphasize that the availability of a centrally-located disposal
site that complies with stringent Subtitle D regulations is important to the stability and efficiency
of the County's overall solid waste management system.

RLC is requesting that the approved PWS and RC zoned areas be rezoned to EFU based on the
guidance provided by LUBA and the Court of Appeals. In reversing the County's 2009 decision
relating to the landfill expansion, LUBA found that the County could not use the Exceptions
process to authorize a use that was allowed by the statutory EFU zone. Based on that guidance,
the County amended the County EFU zone to more closely match state law thus allowing "the
maintenance, expansion or enhancement of an existing site on the same tract for the disposal of
solid waste for which a permit has been granted under ORS 459.245 by the DEQ." Any

Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
expansion must satisfy the standards set for the in ORS 215.296(1) (a) and (b) and the standards
set forth in Section 1101, Site Design Review.

Riverbend Landfill has operated at this location for more than 30 years. RLC is committed to
operating as a good neighbor to the surrounding agricultural community and there is no
evidence that the existing landfill has impaired or conflicted with the use of farm or forest land.
Rezoning the existing landfill from PWS to EFU will not materially change the established
patterns of land uses in the immediate vicinity. Solid waste disposal sites are clearly contemplated
as an appropriate and permitted non-farm use in the EFU zone. Now that the County's EFU is
consistent with the statutory EFU zone, it is appropriate to rezone the PWS and RC-zoned areas
back to EFU and "vacate" the exceptions to Goal 3 that the County previously approved.

Approval of the PA/ZC to EFU does not constitute approval of a future expansion. However,
it will provide the opportunity for RLC to submit an application for future expansion of the
existing site on the same tract, subject to the criteria in YCZO 402.02 (V). RLC will need to
demonstrate that any future development will not force significant changes to farm and forest
practices or costs on surrounding lands devoted to farm and forest use. This will assure
compliance with Policy H, which does not prohibit any potential impairment to farm land.

     Goal 2: To conserve Yamhill County's soil resources in a manner reflecting their suitability
     for forestry, agriculture and urban development and their sustained use for the purposes
     designated on the county plan map.

Response: Riverbend is located in an area of high-value farm soils. As noted earlier, the County
decided that this was an appropriate location for development of a landfill with approval of the
initial plan map amendment to PWS in 1980. Riverbend Landfill operates in compliance with its
approved DEQ SWDP, and all landfill cells developed since 1993 include a composite liner
system which exceeds Subtitle D regulations.

Figure 5 identifies vicinity soils based on NRCS Soils Data (2012). Goal 3 generally requires that
counties in Western Oregon inventory and apply EFU zoning to Class I-IV soils. Nothing in
Goal 3 precludes application of EFU zoning to other soils. As shown in Figure 5, there are areas
of non-high value farmland in the vicinity of Riverbend Landfill, and the same EFU zoning is
applied to high-value and non-high value farmland.

Because Goal 3 allows landfills as a non-farm use in the EFU zone, the PA/ZC to EFU is
appropriate to reflect and authorize the established landfill use.




Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                            Page 65
Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
     Policy A: Yamhill County will continue to preserve those areas for farm use which exhibit
     Class I through IV soils as identified in the Capability Classification System of the U.S. Soil
     Conservation Service.

Response: As shown in Figure 5, the predominant soils in the PA/ZC area include Amity silt
loam (Am) and Woodburn silt loam (WuB), with smaller areas in the Chehalis series (Ck) and
the Cove series (Cs). The Am, WuB and Ck soils are classified as high-value farmland (Class I ­
IV soils). The Cs soils are not classified as high-value farmland. The PA/ZC area includes a mix
of developed areas (including the permitted landfill and ancillary facilities such as the office, gas-
to-energy facility, entrance facilities, leachate storage pond, gas monitoring wells, RV park) and
undeveloped areas (including floodplain/riparian areas, fields and remnant orchards).

RLC is not arguing that the soils under the existing permitted and developed areas meet the
definition of "agricultural land" and should be zoned EFU on that basis. However, soils in the
undeveloped areas currently zoned PWS and RC exhibit Class I through IV soils and are
appropriate to zone EFU on that basis, consistent with the zoning applied to surrounding lands.
Policy A does not preclude zoning other areas that no longer exhibit Class I ­ IV soils for EFU.

As described earlier in this narrative, Goal 3 allows solid waste disposal facilities in an EFU
zone. This authority is set forth in ORS 215.283(2)(k) as refined by OAR 660-033-0120.

OAR 660-033-0120 and OAR 660-033-0130(18) recognize that solid waste disposal facilities are
a permissible non-farm use, but limit such facilities by allowing new facilities only on low-value
farmland, and by allowing only the maintenance, expansion, or enhancement of existing facilities
on high-value farmland.

Following direction provided by LUBA and the Court of Appeals, the County has amended its
EFU zone to more closely match and implement the statutory EFU zone and OAR 660-033-
0120. The County will no longer use the goal exception process to authorize a particular non-
farm use (solid waste disposal site) on EFU land that is allowed by state statute and rule.

Because the existing landfill and ancillary facilities are a permitted use in the EFU zone under
Goal 3, OAR 660-033-0120 and the County's EFU zone (Section 402.02.V), rezoning all areas
currently zoned PWS and RC is consistent with Policy A. Following approval of the PA/ZC,
any future expansion would be subject to Site Design Review approval, would require findings
to document that the expansion would not have a significant impact on existing farm and forest
uses in the vicinity, and would require DEQ approval of a modification of Solid Waste Permit
345 prior to County approval of a final site development plan.

In 2009, the County found that a need for the continued operation of the landfill to serve the
County and approved an expansion of approximately 98 acres. While RLC is not requesting Site

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                               Page 66
Riverbend Landfill                                                                            September 2013
Design Review approval as part of this PA/ZC application, and is not required to do so, the
conceptual Future Expansion Area is smaller than the expansion area approved in 2009.
Additionally, RLC is pursuing options to develop a Green Technology facility at Riverbend that
could further reduce the acreage needed for disposal of residual wastes.

Finally, while the County's EFU zone now authorizes solid waste disposal sites on EFU land
consistent with Goal 3, the County only allows the "maintenance, expansion or enhancement of
an existing site on the same tract." By applying only to existing solid waste disposal sites, the
County's EFU zone minimizes the overall non-farm uses allowed in the EFU Zone and
continues to generally preserve areas with Class I ­ IV soils for farm use.

2. Water Resources
     Goal 1: To conserve and to manage efficiently our water resources in order to sustain and
     enhance the quantity and quality of flows for all consumptive and non-consumptive uses and
     to abate flood, erosion and sedimentation problems.

Response: RLC has both a permit to withdraw surface water from the South Yamhill River and
a domestic groundwater well that provides potable water to the landfill office and a well that
serves the RV park. RLC also maintains an extensive system of groundwater monitoring wells
around the perimeter of the landfill that are used for environmental monitoring purposes rather
than water consumptive uses.

When compared with agricultural irrigation or municipal uses of groundwater and surface water,
Riverbend Landfill does not place high volume demands on water resources. RLC withdraws
water from the South Yamhill River and stores it in a 25,000 gallon tank for use in dust
suppression and backup fire protection. Leachate that is currently collected is trucked off site for
disposal.

Riverbend Landfill currently operates under the provisions of DEQ SWDP 345. The permit
includes operating conditions to address surface water, erosion, and sedimentation control.
Additionally, RLC maintains existing stormwater outfalls under the provisions and conditions of
a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Discharge Permit No.
1200-Z.

Based on a long history of operation, RLC has documented a record of compliance with
conserving and managing water resources efficiently.

In addition to County approval of the PA/ZC, the conceptual future expansion of Riverbend
Landfill would require renewal and modification of the DEQ NPDES permit and an updated
Storm Water Pollution Control Plan (SWPCP). DEQ permitting and monitoring requirements
would ensure that Riverbend Landfill would continue to conserve and manage water resources

Riverbend Landfill                                                                       September 2013
efficiently subject to DEQ and County standards to abate flood, erosion, and sedimentation
problems.

     Policy B: Yamhill County will continue participation in the FEMA National Flood Insurance
     Program to prevent flood-caused loss of life and property, by identifying and mapping the
     floodplains and floodways of the county, restricting land uses within the floodplains to those
     which are open and undeveloped, including forestry, agriculture, wildlife habitat and
     recreational areas and encouraging improved watershed management practices and the
     construction of watershed storage projects for flood control.

Response: When Riverbend Landfill was initially authorized at this location in 1980, the County
approved a conditional use floodplain permit to allow the deposit of fill within the 100-year
flood plain of the South Yamhill River. The berm along the easterly boundary of the DEQ-
approved permit area separates the waste disposal area from the floodway of the South Yamhill
River.

A landfill located in a floodplain must not restrict the flow of the 100-year flood, reduce the
temporary water storage capacity of the floodplain, or result in washout of solid waste to pose a
hazard to human health and the environment. Riverbend Landfill is located outside the floodway
of the South Yamhill River, the floodway being the minimum area of a river required to convey
flows associated with a 100-year flood event. A portion of the landfill was originally constructed
within the 100-year floodplain pursuant to a floodplain development permit the County issued
concurrently with the original land use approval for the landfill (Order No. 80-262). The U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) assisted the County and RLC with siting the landfill by
conducting hydraulic analyses that allowed the County to conclude that the landfill could safely
operate in its current location, while also not encroaching on the floodway. The landfill includes
a permanent flood protection berm that lies outside the floodway.

RLC recently worked with the County in obtaining a Letter of Map Revision from FEMA that
resulted in a more accurate depiction of the 100-year floodplain and floodway in the reach of the
South Yamhill River associated with Riverbend Landfill. The Map Revision was adopted by
FEMA on May 9, 201336. The revision was based on more accurate topographic data than that
used in the 1980s: the updated topography accounted for all changes since the 1980s, including
the presence of Riverbend Landfill and Whiteson Landfill. The revision also required the use of
the Corps' most modern hydraulic modeling methods and software. As a result, the Flood
Insurance Rate Maps now portray the correct locations of the 100-year floodplain and floodway
in the vicinity of the landfills. Those maps will be used to guide future development consistent
with County and FEMA regulations.

Based on current conceptual plans and hydraulic modeling, RLC believes that the few relatively
minor floodplain impacts associated with the conceptual future expansion would not create a
rise in the base flood elevation. Any specific development proposed to be in the floodplain
would have to be reviewed by the County as part of a Floodplain Development Permit. Future
landfill areas would not encroach into the floodway.

     Policy I: Where conflicting uses are identified or intended, in specific proposals or programs,
     the economic, social, environmental and energy consequences of the conflicting uses shall be
     determined and used as a basis for decision-making.

Response: Approval of the PA/ZC to EFU would allow RLC to submit a subsequent Site
Design Review application for a conceptual future expansion onto high-value EFU land on the
same tract. Because Goal 3 and the County's EFU zone expressly authorize a landfill as a
permitted non-farm use in the EFU zone, the use is not inherently considered a "conflicting
use". The following table summarizes positive and negative consequences that can be used as a
basis for decision-making and a conclusion that, on balance, the positive consequences outweigh
negative consequences.

       Policy J: It is the policy of Yamhill County to protect riparian vegetation from damage that
       may result from land use applications for development that is otherwise permitted outright or
       conditionally under county zoning regulations. To achieve this goal, Yamhill County will
       review land use applications for development in riparian areas in an effort to mitigate or
       prevent damage to riparian vegetation that might result from the development. For purposes
       of this policy, "riparian areas" refers to areas within 100 feet measured horizontally from
       the ordinary high water line of streams identified as "Fish Habitat" in the comprehensive
       plan inventory (Natural Resource Conservation Plan, Yamhill County, Oregon, May 1979 ­
       USDA ­ Soil Conservation Services), that are not regulated under the Forest Practices Act.

Response: The Goal 5 findings in Section III are relevant to Policy J and are incorporated by
this reference. RLC has confirmed that the South Yamhill River is identified as fish habitat in the
comprehensive plan inventory. Under the existing EFU zoning, farm practices adjacent to
streams are not regulated through zoning. However, several County, state, and federal resource
agencies and watershed groups are working cooperatively with farmers to maintain and enhance
riparian areas abutting streams for water quality and habitat values.

The proposed PA/ZC will remain subject to Policy J above. As described in the Goal 5 findings,
RLC is proposing adoption of a parallel ordinance in conjunction with this PA/ZC. This
ordinance will assure that any future expansion complies with the 100-foot setback specified in
Policy J above and also implements the specific "safe harbor" provisions for riparian corridors
set forth in the Goal 5 rule.37

3. Fish and Wildlife
       Goal 1: To conserve the fish and wildlife habitat of Yamhill County with a view to
       maintaining an optimum ecological balance, enhancing the sport fishing and hunting
       resource of the county, and protect endangered species.

Response: This area of the County is not designated as a big game winter range area and is not
actively managed for sport fishing or hunting. However, the South Yamhill River is identified as
fish habitat and the open fields and wooded areas in the project vicinity support a wide variety of
wildlife.

RLC is committed to managing and operating the landfill in a manner that maintains and
enhances fish and wildlife habitat values. As discussed in the Goal 5 section above, protected
riparian corridors also promote the conservation of fish habitat.

In 2005, WM received Corporate Wildlife Habitat Certification for its environmental
stewardship and wildlife management programs at the Riverbend Landfill site; in 2007 and 2009
that certification was renewed. As described in the Wildlife Management Plan (Attachment E),
the management objectives of the plan can be used to address both short-term and long-term

37
     See Attachment D, Draft Goal 5 Ordinance.

habitat management to enhance fish and wildlife habitat and overall ecosystem function,
consistent with Goal 1.

     Policy A: Yamhill County will cooperate with the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Department, the
     Yamhill County cities, the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, the
     Bureau of Reclamation, and the soil and water conservation districts of the region to identify,
     conserve, and protect fish and wildlife habitat; determine areas of critical imbalance and
     threats to particular species; and formulate and implement measures for the improvement of
     existing habitat and the creation of new habitat where needed.

Response: The mission of the Yamhill County Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) is
to conserve, restore, and protect the County's natural resources by providing technical, financial,
and educational assistance to citizens, landowners, and businesses. SWCD programs promote
voluntary adoption of land management practices by landowners that are needed to protect
natural resources and associated wildlife habitat, and water quantity and quality values.

In many Oregon counties, the federal government plays the largest role in land management.
Less than 10 percent of the County land base is state or federally owned compared to over 50
percent for the rest of Oregon. In the County, private land owners must make land use decisions
that provide personal income and conserve natural resources, while also meeting state and
federal laws relating to endangered species, water quality, and forest harvest.

The SWCD supports a range of approaches to address natural resource issues that include
protection and preservation of sensitive lands, restoration of degraded plant and animal habitats,
and support of agricultural and forestry production. RLC is committed to working with ODFW,
the SWCD and other watershed groups to demonstrate that the continued operation and
conceptual future expansion of Riverbend Landfill can conserve, enhance, and create improved
fish and wildlife habitat relative to existing conditions.

As discussed above, WM received Corporate Wildlife Habitat Certification for its environmental
stewardship and wildlife management programs at Riverbend Landfill.

     Policy B: Yamhill County will recognize the need to conserve and protect fish and wildlife
     habitat in its plan implementation measures, and the following will be considered in any
     public or private land use determination subject to county review: the impact of harvesting
     forested areas where there is no forest management plan for regeneration of the forest lands;
     the filling or drainage of swamps or marshes; the damming of rivers and streams; the
     location and construction of highways and utility transmission lines; and any other land
     development activities which significantly interfere with the vegetation or soil cover or
     drainage patterns in critical habitat areas.

Response: As described earlier in this narrative, any future landfill expansion would be subject
to multiple levels of review and permitting by several agencies, including DEQ, DSL, ODFW,


Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                           Page 71
Riverbend Landfill                                                                          September 2013
and ODOT. The County is the lead agency for land use and all of the other agencies would
coordinate with the County during their permitting processes.

Because Riverbend Landfill has operated at this location for many years, substantial landfill
related infrastructure is already in place and can be leveraged to accommodate the continued
operation and expansion, as opposed to constructing a new landfill in a greenfield setting. The
land terrain, soil cover, and vegetation have already been modified with 30 years of landfill
operation at this location. However, even with this long land use history, the County and
resource agencies would have a substantial role in the review and permitting for any future
expansion. The County's Site Design Review process and the state agency permitting would
provide the opportunity to review and condition proposed expansion plans to ensure
maintenance of adequate setbacks to protect riparian areas and other mitigation measures that
might be needed to conserve and protect wildlife habitat as required by Policy B.

4. Open Space
     Goal 1: To insure the continuance of the open space character that has always existed in
     Yamhill County.

Response: The stated goal to insure the continuance of the open space character does not imply
that no uses or development would be allowed in the rural areas of the County. The Yamhill
County Plan Map has reflected a substantial concentration of more than 200 acres of PWS
zoning at this location for more than 30 years. The YCZO includes 7 rural residential zones, 3
commercial zones, 3 industrial zones, and 3 public facility zones that are available in the
unincorporated area. In addition, the resource zones (Farm & Forest) allow the opportunity for
up to 50 different non-resource uses in the resource zones.

The County's Parks Master Plan recognizes the unique characteristics of landfills in that they
allow the development of passive open space once closed. The County also uses the Site Design
Review process as the primary implementation tool to assess the compatibility and character of
proposed developments. The Site Design Review process does not apply to development
associated with resource uses, but it would be required for any future expansion of Riverbend
Landfill.

Under Section 1101.02, the review of a site development plan will be based upon consideration
of the following:

     Characteristics of adjoining and surrounding uses;
           1. Economic factors relating to the proposed use;
           2. Traffic safety, internal circulation, and parking;
           3. Provisions for adequate noise and/or visual buffering from noncompatible uses;
Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                         Page 72
Riverbend Landfill                                                                        September 2013
            4. Retention of existing natural features on site;
            5. Problems that may arise due to development within potential hazard areas;
            6. Comments and/or recommendations of adjacent and vicinity property owners whose
               interests may be affected by the proposed use.

The Site Design Review process includes public notice and the opportunity for a public hearing.
A final grading plan, landscape plan, and design cross sections and elevations are required as part
of the required plan set. In summary, Riverbend Landfill has a long history of operation and the
open space character of this area already includes the existing landfill. Additionally, the
subsequent Site Design Review process would provide the opportunity for public and County
review of more specific and detailed landscape and buffering proposals for the conceptual
Future Expansion Area.

5. Outstanding Scenic Views and Sites
       Goal 1: To protect outstanding scenic views and sites for future generations.

Response: Outstanding scenic views and sites exist throughout the County. Varied scenic vistas
of wooded hillsides, vineyards, productive farm lands, and streams and rivers provide an
important component of the livability, attractiveness, and economic health of the County for
residents and visitors. Under Statewide Planning Goal 5, local governments are not required to
amend acknowledged comprehensive plans in order to identify scenic views and sites. 38 Similar
to most counties in Oregon, the County has not adopted comprehensive inventories or
regulations for protection of scenic views and sites and no sites have been designated in the
general vicinity of Riverbend Landfill.

       Policy A: Yamhill County will allow uses that may impact scenic resources in the county,
       subject to the protection offered by the Statewide Land Use Planning Goals, Yamhill County
       Comprehensive Plan and zoning provisions, particularly site design review, solid waste
       enforcement, and any other measures as may be adopted to protect the scenic attractiveness
       of the county.

Response: As noted above, Oregon's planning program has not pushed regulation of private
land uses to protect scenic views, particularly in rural areas. In general, local communities and
public agencies have focused on protecting significant resource areas (including scenic views
from areas such as Bald Peak) through acquisition and public ownership.

If the County approves the requested PA/ZC to EFU, any future expansion would be subject to
the County's Site Design Review process.39 The Site Design Review process provides a
framework "to review commercial and industrial development proposals, to insure safe,

functional, energy-efficient developments which are compatible with the natural and human-
made environment, and to resolve potential conflicts that may arise between proposed
developments and adjacent uses."

Review of a site development plan will be based upon consideration of the following factors:

           Characteristics of adjoining and surrounding uses;
           Provisions for adequate noise and/or visual buffering;
           Retention of existing natural features on site; and
           Comments and/or recommendations of adjacent and vicinity property owners whose
           interests may be affected by the proposed use.
RLC understands and expects substantial public interest in screening and buffering plans for any
future expansion. RLC will commit to a robust community process and design to anticipate and
address visual impacts and concerns of vicinity property owners, agencies, and interest groups
through the Site Design Review process.

     Policy B: the Yamhill County Parkway Committee, established by Board Order 88-642, will
     develop a strategy for establishing a parkway along the State Highways 99 and 18 corridors
     in Yamhill County.

Response: No County strategy has been adopted for establishing a parkway along State
Highways 99 and 18.

Therefore, there are no plans or programs in place that relate to scenic corridor protection for
Highway 18. However, RLC understands that Highway 18 is an important tourist route and
heavily traveled corridor linking the County and the Portland metro area to the Oregon coast.
Any future expansion would be subject to Site Design Review approval, and screening and
buffering is an important consideration of that review process.

While detailed plans for the conceptual future expansion have not yet been prepared, RLC's
2008 application included a proposal to construct a substantial berm parallel to Highway 18 that
would be planted with trees and shrubs to screen views of the landfill from travelers on Highway
18 and the surrounding area. RLC fully expects that the level of screening that will be required
for any future expansion will be more extensive than typically provided for commercial,
industrial, or public facility uses adjacent to Highway 18.

C. Section III ­ Transportation, Communications and Public Utilities
1. Transportation
       Goal 1: To provide and encourage an efficient, safe, convenient and economic transportation
       and communication system, including road, rail, waterways, public transit and air, to serve
       the needs of existing and projected urban and rural development within the county, as well as
       to accommodate the regional movement of people and goods and the transfer of energy,
       recognizing the economic, social and energy impacts of the various modes of transportation.

Response: The County has adopted a Transportation System Plan (TSP) that is coordinated
with the transportation system plans of the cities and the State TSP. Riverbend Landfill has an
approved direct access point to the state highway system (Highway 18) that includes a left turn
pocket for vehicles entering the landfill and a right turn acceleration lane for vehicles leaving the
facility. This existing access meets ODOT standards for sight distance and safety.

As outlined in the Traffic Impact Study40 prepared in accordance with ODOT requirements, the
existing primary access would be retained and can accommodate the PA/ZC area and
conceptual Future Expansion Area while continuing to maintain compliance with ODOT
access, safety, and level of service standards for Highway 18.

Highway 18 is classified as a Statewide Roadway, is on the National Highway System, and is a
designated freight route. As documented in the Traffic Study, the trips associated with the
landfill constitute a very small portion of overall traffic volumes on the state highway. This
PA/ZC and conceptual future expansion would not result in a significant change in the
percentage of trips relative to the overall background traffic on Highway 18.

If Riverbend Landfill is not expanded and does not continue operation beyond 2017, the most
likely disposal alternative for the County would involve consolidating and shipping residual solid
waste to out-of-County landfills. Relative to the central location of Riverbend Landfill in the
County, alternative disposal sites are located distances of 38 miles (Coffin Butte Landfill), 123
miles (Wasco County Landfill) and 183 miles (Columbia Ridge Landfill) from the McMinnville
area.

According to studies from the EPA, the transportation sector accounts for approximately 34
percent of our greenhouse gas and CO2 emissions, followed by electricity consumption at 32
percent. Methane emissions from landfills accounts for 2 percent of the sources of greenhouse
gas. 41 Long haul trucking of waste to more distant landfills would obviously require more energy
and result in higher air emissions relative to the alternative of expanding Riverbend Landfill as a
more centrally located disposal site for the existing service area.

Riverbend Landfill                                                                           September 2013
     Policy G: Yamhill County will appoint a committee of interested citizens to study all State
     highways within the county and inventory and evaluate the aesthetic features of the views
     from such highways, consider the eligibility of specific sections for designation as scenic
     areas under the provisions of the Scenic Areas Act, and make appropriate recommendations
     to the Planning Commission and Board of Commissioners in respect to a petition to the
     Scenic Area Board to hold hearings on the possible designation of scenic areas within
     Yamhill County.

Response: As mentioned earlier, none of the state highways in the County have been designated
as Scenic Byways or State Tour Routes (15 are currently designated in Oregon). ODOT uses a
pre-application process to screen potential projects for scenic highway designations. The pre-
application requires the following elements:

           Documenting the scenic values of the proposed route visually and descriptively;
           Securing local government support for the designation; and
           Preparing a Corridor Management Plan for the proposed route.
In summary, Policy G has been included in the Plan since 1979, and none of the state highways
in the County have been designated as state scenic highways in the almost 30 years that have
passed since adoption of the plan. However, even in the absence of an official scenic highway
dedication, any future expansion would be subject to Site Design Review and that process would
include consideration of methods to screen near views of the landfill from Highway 18.

     Policy J: Yamhill County will require new development to:

           1. Limit access points on highways designated as arterials when alternative access
              points are feasible.
           2. Provide a frontage setback requirement of 50 feet from the public right-of-way of all
              designated arterials within the county for commercial and industrial development;
              and
           3. Minimize direct access points onto arterial right-of-ways by encouraging the
              utilization of common driveways.

Response: ODOT has adopted access management standards for private accesses to state
highways (OAR 734-051). These standards indicate that private accesses along Highway 18 in
this area should be spaced 1,320 feet apart. As summarized in the Traffic Analysis, there are two
existing private access connections to Highway 18 along the frontage of the parcels included in
the PA/ZC or conceptual Future Expansion Area. The existing primary entrance to the landfill
would be retained at its existing location. The existing access to the RV park will be a used for a
more limited operations/maintenance access that would have significantly fewer trips than the
RV park.



Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                            Page 76
Riverbend Landfill                                                                           September 2013
This PA/ZC will not preclude any future expansion of Riverbend Landfill from being set back
at least 50 feet from the Highway 18 right-of-way. In summary, the proposed PA/ZC and
conceptual future expansion would comply with Policy J because RLC would retain the existing
approved access points to Highway 18 (a designated arterial) and would maintain more than the
required 50 foot frontage setback from the edge of right-of-way.

     Policy N: Yamhill County will utilize existing facilities and right-of-ways to the fullest extent
     possible provided that such use is consistent with the county comprehensive plan.

Response: The proposed PA/ZC and conceptual Future Expansion Area can be
accommodated with existing transportation facilities and improvements. The primary access
point to the landfill would be retained. With the direct access to Highway 18 that only serves the
landfill, traffic is concentrated on the state highway (a designated arterial) rather than on the
rural County road system, consistent with the functional classification of roadways in the
Yamhill County Transportation System Plan. The designated arterials are designed and intended
to accommodate higher traffic volumes and freight movement.

Because Highway 18 is under ODOT jurisdiction, a Traffic Impact Study is required for the
proposed plan amendment. A copy of the analysis is included in Attachment B and documents
that the PA/ZC would not have a significant effect on the state highway system. For these
reasons, approval of the requested PA/ZC is consistent with the County's policy to use existing
transportation facilities to the full extent possible, consistent with the comprehensive plan and
the functional classification of Highway 18.

D. Section IV ­ Public Land, Facilities, and Services
1. Public Facilities and Services
     Policy L: Yamhill County will encourage and cooperate with regional solid waste
     management programs in scale with the county's needs and subject to equitable cost-sharing
     arrangements for each of the services and facilities developed on a regional basis.

Response: This policy underscores the County's long-standing commitment to a regional
approach to solid waste management. ORS 459 gives counties the authority to establish a solid
waste program and a second administrative rule (OAR 340-60-026) does not allow DEQ to issue
a solid waste permit unless the proposed facility is compatible with an adopted SWMP.

Ordinance 578 provides the legal authority and policy direction for managing solid waste in the
County. It stipulates that the County will regulate the accumulation, collection and disposal of
waste and solid waste, and the creation and operation of disposal sites to accomplish the
following:




Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                              Page 77
Riverbend Landfill                                                                             September 2013
   a.      Provide for safe and sanitary accumulation, storage, collection, transportation, and
           disposal of solid waste.
   b.      Prohibit and provide for abatement of accumulation of waste, or solid waste, on
           private property in a manner that would create a public nuisance, a hazard to health,
           or a condition of unsightliness.
   c.      Develop a regional long range plan to provide adequate disposal sites and disposal
           facilities to meet future demands.
   d.      Provide a coordinated countywide program of control of solid waste in cooperation
           with federal, state, and local agencies responsible for the prevention, control, or
           abatement of air, water, and ground pollution.
   e.      Provide for and encourage research, studies, surveys, and demonstration projects on
           developing more sanitary, efficient, and economical solid waste disposal systems and
           programs.
   f.      Provide for a coordinated solid waste disposal programs with cities within the
           County and with other counties or cities, should regional programs be developed.
   g.      Provide for cooperation and agreements between the County and other counties
           involving joint or regional franchising or licensing of solid waste collection or
           disposal.
   h.      Provide minimum standards for location and operation of disposal sites to protect
           adjacent or nearby residents.
The SWMP adopted by the County in 2004 reinforces the County's endorsement of a regional
approach for providing disposal services. Similarly, the County's updates to the SWMP in 2008
and 2009 through the JR Miller and Zia reports acknowledge the many benefits of the continued
operation of Riverbend Landfill. Approval of the requested PA/ZC and conceptual future
expansion of Riverbend Landfill is consistent with Policy L and would provide the opportunity
for the County to continue with the approach to solid waste management that has worked well
for decades. County residential, commercial, and industrial customers would retain access to a
centrally located, convenient, and cost-effective disposal site for residual wastes generated in the
County. Continued operation of Riverbend Landfill as a regional disposal site would also
maintain economic benefits to the County with ongoing annual payments of licensing and host
fees. With the new license agreement adopted in 2012, fees charged on out-of-county waste
disposed at Riverbend Landfill have been increased substantially, and are now estimated at more
than $1.2 million per year.

        Policy O: Groundwater supplies will be protected from critical draw-downs or disrupted
        flows occasioned by surrounding land use development or activities, such as mining and
        logging where municipal watersheds exist; surface water supplies will be protected from
        unusual increases in turbidity and sedimentation caused by farming, logging, mining,
        excavation or grading; and both ground water and surface water supplies will be protected
        from contamination by subsurface sewage disposal systems, sewage lagoons, sanitary landfill
        sites and other sources of pollution.



Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                              Page 78
Riverbend Landfill                                                                             September 2013
Response: The Oregon Water Resources Department (OWRD) has not identified the project
area as a sensitive or critical groundwater area. Maps available on the OWRD web site identify
three groundwater "sensitive" areas in the County: 1) Parrett Mountain, 2) Chehalem Mountain,
and 3) Amity Hills. Additionally, this area of the County is not identified as a municipal
watershed for any of the ten incorporated cities.

The existing landfill operates in compliance with DEQ SWDP 345 and federal Subtitle D
regulations. State and federal regulations include stringent requirements to monitor and protect
groundwater and surface water supplies from potential landfill impacts. Groundwater and
leachate monitoring are included in Riverbend Landfill's DEQ-approved environmental
monitoring plan (EMP). Additionally, RLC has conducted extensive groundwater studies since
the late 1980's, including:

           Drilled/sampled over 135 subsurface borings/test pits;
           Collected thousands of soil samples;
           Installed over 60 monitoring wells and collected thousands of groundwater samples for
           laboratory analysis;
           Performed hydraulic testing at 25 locations; and
           Made over 2,800 measurements of groundwater elevations.
Riverbend Landfill's DEQ-approved monitoring program includes 1) semiannual groundwater-
quality monitoring of the site's compliance and detection wells, 2) routine testing of leachate and
liquid samples collected from the secondary collection subsystems, 3) lab testing of extensive list
of chemical compounds (approved by DEQ as specified in Riverbend Landfill's EMP), and 4)
routine reporting of EMP-approved monitoring to DEQ. There are currently 10 groundwater
monitoring wells installed at the existing permit boundary and groundwater samples are obtained
at least semi-annually and reported to DEQ annually in environmental monitoring reports.

RLC's surface water management objectives during landfill operations include the following:

           Intercept and divert run-on away from active and closed landfill modules;
           Minimize site erosion;
           Temporarily store excess peak runoff and discharge it at a controlled rate;
           Remove suspended solids from surface water runoff; and
           Collect/contain leachate-contaminated stormwater that accumulates in active landfill
           areas and provide a flexible system of controls to accommodate facility changes.
Following County approval of the requested PA/ZC, any future expansion would be subject to
County Site Design Review approval and meet DEQ permitting requirements. RLC would have
to prepare and submit an updated Site Development Plan and EMP for the Future Expansion

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                       Page 79
Riverbend Landfill                                                                      September 2013
Area. Approval of a modification to DEQ SWDP 345 would be contingent upon DEQ
approval of the updated Site Development and EMP and would assure that ongoing
environmental monitoring is performed and reported to DEQ to verify the effectiveness of the
environmental controls to protect groundwater and surface water.

2. Parks and Recreation
     Policy C: Yamhill County will seek to offer greater opportunities for water-based recreation
     on the Willamette and South Yamhill Rivers and their tributaries.

Response: The County established a boat access to the South Yamhill River (Monroe Landing)
adjacent to the closed Whiteson Landfill. According to County staff, the County has experienced
challenges with maintaining the small park site because of flooding impacts and isolation. The
access to the park site is currently locked, and individuals must contact the County to obtain
permission to unlock the gate and drive into the site. The County recently approved a
conditional use permit for the parks department to establish a day use park to the south of
Whiteson Landfill.

While not directly connected with the PA/ZC, the WM Stewardship Project may also include
future opportunities for greater public access to the South Yamhill River.

E. Section V ­ Environmental Quality
1. Air, Water and Land Resources Quality
     Goal 1: To conserve and to protect natural resources, including air, water, soil and
     vegetation and wildlife, from pollution or deterioration which would dangerously alter the
     ecological balance, be detrimental to human health, or compromise the beauty and
     tranquility of the natural environment.

Response: Riverbend Landfill has operated at this location for more than 30 years without
dangerously altering the ecological balance of the area. The existing landfill and the conceptual
future expansion allowed by the zone change would continue to be operated in compliance with
rigorous state and federal environmental regulations that apply to MSW disposal sites. RCRA
Subtitle D rules for MSW landfills require significant capital investments for providing a robust
liner system below landfills, installing and monitoring groundwater monitoring wells, providing
leachate collection and treatment facilities, constructing landfill gas collection and destruction
systems, and providing sufficient funds to close and monitor landfills for at least 30 years after
closure. The overall objective of the regulations is to protect human health and the environment.

RLC, operating under DEQ permits, actively monitors for potential environmental impacts
(including those to air, groundwater, and surface water) and submits regular monitoring reports
to DEQ to document compliance with established standards and regulations. The level of DEQ
oversight, review, and monitoring of the landfill operation provides assurances to the County

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                          Page 80
Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
that Riverbend Landfill and any future expansion of the facility will be operated to conserve and
protect natural resources and human health as set out in Goal 1 above. Additionally, if this
PA/ZC is approved, any future expansion would be subject to the County's Site Design Review
process. This process would include consideration of screening and landscaping for
compatibility with the natural setting. RLC provides regular pickup of blown litter along the
Highway 18 to minimize impacts on the beauty and tranquility of the setting. Furthermore, the
Stewardship Project provides an exciting opportunity for RLC to partner with the community to
establish uses and partnerships for the approximately 450 acres of buffer lands around the
landfill. RLC envisions that the Stewardship Project will retain and enhance the agricultural
productivity and character of the project vicinity.

     Policy A: Yamhill County will cooperate with the State Department of Environmental Quality
     in enforcing state and federal regulations designed to achieve high air quality.

Response: The County has not adopted County air quality standards, but instead coordinates
with and relies on DEQ enforcement of state and federal air quality regulations. RLC is not
allowed to conduct any open burning at the site and RLC also maintains a DEQ Title V air
permit. Any future expansion allowed by this PA/ZC, including a potential new Green
Technology facility, would also require new and/or amended DEQ Title V permits to maintain
and achieve high air quality.

     Policy B: Yamhill County will, in making land use decisions relative to industrial or other
     uses likely to pose a threat to air quality, consider proximity of the proposed use to
     residential areas and meteorological factors such as seasonal prevailing wind direction and
     velocity.

Response: RLC owns approximately 700 acres in the vicinity of Riverbend Landfill which
ensures a very substantial buffer between landfill operations and surrounding agricultural or
other use areas. With a location approximately 2 miles from existing urban areas, there is no
existing or planned urban residential development in proximity to the landfill. Additionally, there
are no established rural residential areas within a 1-mile radius of the landfill. With existing EFU-
80 zoning in the general vicinity, the overall density of farm related dwellings is quite low.

All public airports post prevailing wind directions by month. Most recent reports for the
McMinnville airport indicate that prevailing winds blow from the southwest from March
through August, and from the north from September through February. In the vicinity of the
landfill, wind generally blows to the east or south, and generally never to the west.

RLC has operated the existing landfill to comply with all state and federal standards (specifically
a Title V Air Quality Permit) and has also modified facilities and operations to address odor
concerns associated with potential landfill gas emissions. The original landfill was constructed


Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                           Page 81
Riverbend Landfill                                                                        September 2013
without a landfill gas management system. However, a landfill gas collection system was
constructed in 1993-94 to address odor and groundwater contamination issues. RLC also
provides daily cover over active disposal areas and uses water trucks to manage dust during the
dry months to minimize air quality impacts of the landfill use.

EPA and the Title V operating permit program require inspections of Riverbend Landfill at least
every other year. According to the DEQ web page on Riverbend Landfill, prior inspections of
the facility have shown it to be in compliance with the Title V permit conditions. The Title V
operating permit also requires annual reports certifying compliance with the various conditions
in the permit, as well as other operating data and annual emissions estimates. As a result of
citizen input and concerns during the last Title V permit renewal, the most recent Title V permit
requires RLC to submit monthly reports concerning operational information, odor complaints,
and odor surveys conducted around the landfill.

RLC acknowledges that historically odor has been a concern for neighbors in the vicinity of
Riverbend Landfill. Landfill gas collection is not an always 100 percent efficient and occasionally
there will be odor at a landfill, but it should not be a common problem for neighbors. The
operation of Riverbend Landfill's gas collection system improved significantly when RLC
discovered liquid in some components of the system. By installing dewatering pumps, RLC has
been able to remove liquid from the gas collection pipes and extraction wells. This allows the
collection system to pull more landfill gas out of the landfill waste cells. Additionally, RLC
reduced the working area significantly and improved the cover system to improve odor
management.

RLC closely monitors the landfill gas management system and will continue to expand and
improve the system in future years as necessary. The expectation is that neighbors and passersby
will rarely detect odor because of significant investments to expand and enhance the landfill gas
collection system. RLC has the expertise to control odor and is committed to continuous
improvement.

Approval of the PA/ZC is consistent with Policy B because DEQ has confirmed that the
existing landfill is operated in compliance with the Title V air quality permit. Any future
expansion would be subject to a modification of the Title V permit and on-going facility and
operational improvements have enhanced RLC's capabilities to control odor.

     Policy C: Yamhill County will cooperate with the State Department of Environmental Quality
     in implementing noise control regulations.

Response: The County has not adopted noise control regulations, but instead relies on DEQ
enforcement of state noise standards.


Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                       Page 82
Riverbend Landfill                                                                      September 2013
Riverbend Landfill is located in a rural area and next to a busy state highway. Background
(ambient) noise is dominated by highway traffic. The noise characteristics associated with the
conceptual future expansion are not expected to change relative to existing conditions. RLC
owns several large surrounding parcels which serve as a substantial buffer around portions of the
active landfill and proposed expansion area. Additionally, the density of houses within a 1-mile
radius of the landfill is very low. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that RLC can comply with
DEQ noise regulations applicable to a future expansion.

RLC has implemented a change in operating hours at the landfill in direct response to input
from neighbors regarding noise and night-time lighting. Historically, Riverbend Landfill was
open from 5 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday, and 6 am to 4 pm on Saturday. In June 2012,
the hours were reduced to 6 am to 4:30 pm, Monday through Friday and 7 am to 3:00 pm on
Saturday. This change in hours required numerous conversations and coordination with
customers, who in turn agreed to adjust their haul schedules to fit the new schedule.

     Policy D: Consideration will be given to adopting an ordinance requiring environmental
     impact review of all major public and private development proposals and the social and
     economic costs and benefits associated with any particular development proposal will be
     properly evaluated prior to public endorsement or approval.

Response: The County has not adopted an ordinance to require environmental impact review
for all major public and private development proposals. However, the PA/ZC application and
supporting information provide information regarding environmental, social, economic, and
energy consequences (including costs and benefits) to justify County approval of a plan
amendment from PWS and RC to EFU.

     Policy E: In order to maintain and improve the quality of the county's air, water and land
     resources, Yamhill County will seek to minimize irreversible and other long-term impacts in
     its development of energy resources; support efforts, where feasible, for the appropriate and
     efficient recovery of energy as a means to reduce waste problems; and encourage a program
     to recover and recycle used motor oil.

Response: As described earlier, RLC has constructed a gas-to-energy facility at Riverbend
Landfill in partnership with McMinnville Water & Light. The landfill gas from Riverbend
Landfill creates a generating capacity of 4.8 megawatts, generating about 36,500 megawatt-hours
per year of electricity. This is enough capacity to power 2,500 Oregon homes. The electricity
generating capacity displaces the need for new electrical turbines powered by natural gas, which
generate additional greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants. Approval of the PA/ZC
and potential future expansion would extend the landfill's ability to generate electricity.

In addition, the County has implemented a program to recycle motor oil. Several recycling
depots in the County accept used motor oil, including the existing recycling depot at Riverbend

Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
Landfill. Therefore, the PA/ZC and future expansion would extend the efficient recovery and
development of the landfill gas energy resource and would also provide and support expansion
of the County's established solid waste recycling and recovery programs, consistent with Policy
E.

F. Section VI ­ Energy Conservation
       Goal 1: To reduce the per capita use of fossil fuels and other non-renewable sources of
       energy through the efficient and appropriate use of all energy.

Response: If Riverbend does not expand, it is expected to cease accepting waste in 2017.
Riverbend currently serves as the only MSW disposal site for the northwest portion of the state,
including all of Yamhill, Columbia, Clatsop, and portions of Tillamook and Washington
Counties. Riverbend Landfill is centrally located in the County and is the closest regional landfill
to the existing service area. The active DEQ permitted regional landfills are located in the
following counties:

           Benton County (Coffin Butte Landfill)
           Gilliam County (Columbia Ridge Landfill)
           Jackson County (Dry Creek Landfill )
           Morrow County (Finley Buttes Landfill )
           Wasco County (Wasco County Landfill)
           Yamhill County (Riverbend Landfill)
As summarized in the DEQ Report to the Legislature42, solid waste disposal in Oregon is
increasingly managed by fewer and more widely spaced disposal facilities. Oregon has 27
operating municipal solid waste landfills and one municipal solid waste energy recovery facility.
Over 90 landfills have been closed in the past two decades. More MSW is being hauled longer
distances for disposal, which has implications for increased use of fossil fuels and related carbon
emissions.

Coffin Butte, Columbia Ridge, and Wasco County landfills are evaluated as alternative disposal
sites for County waste in the report prepared by ECONorthwest.43 Measured from McMinnville
in central Yamhill County, Coffin Butte Landfill is a distance of 38 miles, Wasco County is a
distance of 123 miles, and Columbia Ridge is a distance of 183 miles. Hauling waste to
alternative landfills would generate increased emissions of air pollutants as heavy trucks traveled
the longer distances. Tables 13 and 14 of the report summarize the estimated emissions per mile

Riverbend Landfill                                                                           September 2013
(based on an EPA computer model) and estimated annual metric tons of emissions from hauling
waste to alternative landfills.

In summary, the PA/ZC to allow an opportunity for future expansion would allow the County
to reduce fossil fuel consumption and would minimize carbon impacts relative to the alternatives
of hauling solid waste longer distances to out-of-County regional landfills. This is consistent with
the County's stated goal for energy conservation.

     Goal 2: To promote the conservation of existing depletable energy resources and the
     development of local, renewable resources to ensure that an adequate supply will be
     available to Yamhill County citizens at a reasonable cost.

Response: As described above, the continued availability of a centrally-located regional landfill
in the County would provide the opportunity for conserving fossil fuel resources relative to the
likely alternative of hauling County solid waste longer distances for disposal at out-of-County
landfills.

In addition, RLC has constructed a gas-to-energy facility in partnership with McMinnville Water
& Light. This facility captures and combusts landfill gas to generate electricity and provides
green energy for customers of the local public utility. WM, the parent company to RLC has been
actively developing landfill gas-to-energy projects for more than 20 years. Once viewed as a
negative byproduct, landfill gas is increasingly considered a safe, economical, and viable green
power alternative to other non-renewable fuels.

Landfill gas is produced through the natural breakdown of waste deposited in a landfill. The gas,
which would otherwise be wasted or dissipated through gas flares, is a readily available,
renewable energy source that can be collected and used directly as medium BTU gas for
industrial use or used to fuel engine generators, which, in turn, generate electricity.

Approval of the PA/ZC will provide the opportunity for a potential future expansion which
would extend the life and capacity of the local gas-to-energy facility.

RLC is also reserving approximately 25 acres of the conceptual Future Expansion Area for an
envisioned Green Technology facility. One potential option under consideration involves a
process that accepts post recycling program wastes currently bound for the landfill, sorts them,
then based on required specifications for an end product, blends them back together to create a
specifically engineered end product. These end products can be designed to have the energy
potential and emissions properties equal or superior to coal or other fossil fuels.

Approval of the PA/ZC will provide the opportunity for RLC to continue to explore and
potentially develop an additional Green Technology at Riverbend Landfill to conserve resources

Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
while developing a marketable energy product. Information on the envisioned Green
Technology is included in Appendix 3.

     Policy C: Yamhill County will support efforts to investigate and establish appropriately
     scaled units of renewable energy production.

Response: Beyond planning to meet the County's long-term needs for solid waste disposal, the
County has the opportunity to continue to support RLC's gas-to-electricity partnership with
McMinnville Water & Light and pursue other Green Technology options as a secondary benefit
of an integrated approach to solid waste management. Such County support is clearly
contemplated in the adopted policy on energy conservation.

     Policy K: Yamhill County will encourage programs for resource recovery and recycling of
     solid wastes.

Response: The County already has several programs in place to encourage resource recovery
and recycling of solid waste and the County is exceeding waste recovery goals set by the Oregon
Legislature in House Bill 3744. Oregon law requires local governments, or their legally
contracted agents, to undertake waste reduction education programs. Solid waste service
providers (particularly franchised haulers) must inform their residential and non-residential
customers of available waste reduction/recycling options and opportunities. Both Recology-
Western Oregon and Waste Management dedicate staff to waste reduction and recycling; the
Yamhill County Solid Waste Department also has an analyst who is dedicated to waste reduction
and recycling. As outlined in the its SWMP, the County analyst has the following responsibilities:

           Ensuring that the County is complying with all requirements regarding provision of
           waste reduction/recycling services.
           Ensuring the availability and distribution of education/information materials for
           outreach related to waste reduction, recycling, reuse, and composting.
           Ensuring that Recology-Western Oregon, Waste Management, and the larger cities are
           maintaining the records necessary for documenting the types and quantities of materials
           recovered.
           Preparing the County's annual Opportunity to Recycle Report to DEQ.
Based on a 2012 license agreement, RLC now pays the County about $1.2 million per year in
licensing and host fees. That revenue supports about two-thirds of the County's Solid Waste
Fund budgeted expenses, and pays for education and outreach programs, household hazardous
waste collection events, and many other programs. The County is eligible to receive host fees on
solid waste disposal because Riverbend is categorized as a regional landfill. If Riverbend is not
expanded after it reaches projected capacity in 2017, continued support of solid waste education,
recycling, and other programs would be more heavily dependent on the County general fund.

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                           Page 86

The County has already demonstrated a good record of achieving goals for recycling and
recovery, and the continued operation and potential future expansion of Riverbend Landfill
would continue to provide financial support for expanded recycling and recovery programs
within the County. RLC recognizes that landfills are a scarce resource that should be carefully
managed to maximize site life.

G. Section VII ­ Implementation, Evaluation, and Review
1. Citizen Involvement
     Policy A: Yamhill County will continue to implement an ongoing citizen involvement program
     that provides county residents opportunity to be involved in all phases of the planning
     process.

Response: The Yamhill County Planning Commission functions as the County's committee for
citizen involvement. County residents are provided with public notices and opportunities to be
involved in Planning Commission meetings and public hearings that pertain to legislative and
quasi-judicial amendments. The proposed PA/ZC is subject to the requirements of OAR 660,
Division 18, Changes to Comprehensive Plans or Land Use Regulations. This OAR outlines
procedures and timelines for the following process elements:

           Filing forms and information on the proposed map amendment with DLCD at least 35
           days prior to the first public hearing. [OAR 660-018-0010]
           If DLCD determines that a proposed change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan
           may not be in compliance with land use statutes or the statewide land use planning goals,
           DLCD will notify the County of the concerns at least 15 days prior to the final
           evidentiary hearing. [OAR 660-018-0035]
           Within 20 days after adopting the final local decision and findings on the map
           amendment, the County will send another notice to DLCD describing the final decision.
           [OAR 660-018-0040]
           In addition to the notice provision required under OAR 660, Division 18, Section 1400
           of the YCZO outlines procedures and timelines for mailed notice and general newspaper
           notice regarding the Planning Commission and Board of Commissioner hearings on the
           proposed plan/zoning map amendments.
Therefore, established state and county procedures will provide ample notice and opportunity
for citizens to be involved in the planning process and public hearings on the proposed PA/ZC.
RLC expects that there will be broad public interest in the proposal and anticipates several
public hearings.

In addition to the standard public notice provision required by law, RLC hosted 17 community
meetings in 2012-13. RLC invited the public to every community meeting with newspaper ads

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                        Page 87
Riverbend Landfill                                                                       September 2013
and community calendar notices; they invited neighbors, others who have expressed interest in
Riverbend Landfill operations, and community leaders. Neighbors and meeting attendees
identified meeting topics and topics they had questions about. Every meeting included agenda
times for Your Questions and Feedback, at which times RLC took questions on any topics and
also welcomed feedback.

Agenda topics at community meetings have included groundwater monitoring, landfill gas
management, floodplain issues, and other topics.

RLC has listened and responded to community input by: 1) changing operating hours in direct
response to feedback from neighbors, 2) establishing a community comment line available 24/7
for reporting issues related to Riverbend operations, 3) implementing new diversion strategies to
reduce the amount of waste going to the landfill, 4) signing a new licensing agreement that pays
the county considerably more for out-of-county waste, 5) implementing a new falcon program to
help manage birds at the landfill, and 6) strengthening operational expertise with the addition of
new staff members at Riverbend.

RLC has briefed elected officials representing every city in the County about ongoing operations,
future plans and RLC's work to be a good neighbor and community partner.

RLC understands and expects that there will be substantial community interest in the requested
PA/ZC and extensive testimony at the public hearings. In summary, RLC has gone beyond the
basic citizen involvement efforts required by Goal 1 and Policy A prior to submitting the land
use application and anticipates ongoing public input and continuing community dialogue
throughout the public hearing process and on an on-going basis.

2. Review and Update
     Policy A: Yamhill County will review any development concepts or proposals which conflict
     with the Plan Map, goals or policies in light of changing needs and conditions and in keeping
     with established procedures of Plan evaluation, amendment, and update.

Response: The County is not in the periodic review process for review and update of the
Comprehensive Plan. However, the proposed plan map amendment will be reviewed for
consistency based on established goals and policies in the acknowledged County Plan in light of
the policy framework established in the 2004 SWMP and established procedures and criteria for
evaluation of plan map amendments.

     Policy B: Yamhill County will undertake a major update of the Comprehensive Plan and
     review of all supporting documents every 5 years to ensure that an adequate factual basis for
     planning decisions is maintained.



Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                          Page 88
Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
Response: Notwithstanding Policy B above, Yamhill County has not undertaken major updates
of the Comprehensive Plan every 5 years, largely because of limited planning staff and resource
constraints. Periodic review is a process by which certain local governments in Oregon examine
and, as necessary, update their comprehensive plan and implement codes. The regulations
governing when and how to complete periodic review have changed several times over the years.

ORS 197.629 and OAR 660-025-0030 provide a schedule of which local governments must go
through the periodic review process:

           Cities inside the Metro or a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) boundary that
           have a population over 2,500 must begin periodic review 7 years after completion of the
           pervious periodic review;
           Cities outside Metro and an MPO with a population over 10,000 within the UGB must
           begin periodic review 10 years after completion of the previous periodic review; and
           Counties must complete periodic review for the area inside urban growth boundaries
           on the same schedule as the cities listed above.
Therefore, under these rules and current population trends, only the cities of Newberg and
McMinnville are required to initiate periodic review every 10 years, and the County will only be
scheduled for periodic review in coordination with the city schedule(s) and only for the
unincorporated area inside the urban growth boundaries. Nothing in state law, however, restricts
the County from a voluntary periodic review and update of the Comprehensive Plan and
implementing ordinances.

Because the County is not involved in or required to begin periodic review, the proposed
PA/ZC is being processed as a post-acknowledgement plan amendment.

     Policy C: Yamhill County will encourage federal, state, and regional agencies and special
     districts to coordinate their planning efforts with those of the county.

Response: Municipal solid waste landfills are one of the most heavily regulated land uses in the
state and in the nation. Riverbend Landfill has operated under County land use and franchise
approval for more than 30 years and the design and operation of the landfill is heavily regulated
and monitored by DEQ for compliance with state and federal environmental rules and
regulations.

The Yamhill County SWMP (2004) was prepared under guidance and in coordination with
DEQ's Solid Waste Division. The County has the lead role in the land use decision for the
proposed landfill expansion. However, other agencies would be involved in subsequent
permitting steps. Additionally, the DEQ and other state agencies have established coordination
programs in place to assure that state agency rules, programs, and permitting programs that

affect land use comply with the statewide goals and are compatible with acknowledged city and
County comprehensive plans.44 Therefore, the County has and will continue to coordinate solid
waste management and permitting decisions with relevant state and federal agencies in
compliance with Policy C.

V. Compliance with Yamhill County Zoning Ordinance
RLC is proposing concurrent amendments to the Yamhill County Comprehensive Plan Map and
Zoning Map. As described earlier in this narrative and shown in Figure 1, the following plan and
zone map amendments are proposed:

     1. Amendment from PWS to EFU (Tax Lots 101 and 200); and
     2. Amendment from RC to EFU (Tax Lot 401).
Approval criteria for a quasi-judicial zone change are set forth in Section 1208 of the YCZO and
findings to address the approval criteria are the focus of this section of the application narrative.

A. Section 1301 ­ Application and Review Procedures
Section 1301 of the YCZO outlines application and review procedures. The ordinance sets forth
three separate types of procedures (A, B, and C). Because the proposal involves a plan map
amendment, the application would be considered under the highest Type C review procedure as
stated below.

     Section 1301.C ­The following procedures shall be used when county ordinance requires
     Type C review of an application.

           1. Prior to or at the time of filing an application, a pre-application conference shall be
              conducted in which the applicant or the applicant's authorized representative shall
              meet with the Director or an authorized member of the department to review
              requirements and concerns about the applicant's request;
           2. The applicant shall submit an application to the Department of Planning and
              Development on a form prescribed by the Director;
           3. Upon receipt of a complete application, a public hearing shall be scheduled and
              public notice mailed and published according to the public notice requirements
              contained in Section 1402;
           4. The appropriate planning advisory committee may hold a public meeting to review
              the application, and may make a recommendation to the commission or hearings
              officer;
           5. At the public hearing the county staff, planning advisory committee, the applicant,
              and other interested parties may present information relevant to the proposal, and
              may give reasons why the application should or should not be approved;
           6. Within 90 days of receipt of a completed application, or such longer period mutually
              agreed to by both the Director and the applicant, the application shall be approved
              or denied based on an evaluation of the proposal and applicable criteria as set forth
              in this ordinance;

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                              Page 91
Riverbend Landfill                                                                             September 2013
           7. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the decision and of the reasons for the
              decision; and
           8. All decisions of the Commission or hearings officer may be appealed to the Board, if
              the appeal is filed within 15 days from the date of the decision, pursuant to Section
              1404 for appeals.

Response: The applicant (i.e., RLC) has complied or will comply with all of the steps for the
Type C procedure set forth above. RLC and authorized representatives participated in a pre-
application conference with the Planning Director and staff on July 8, 2013. At that meeting, the
staff provided background information on applicable criteria, standards, and procedures, and
highlighted key issues to address in the application.

RLC submitted this application with the required fee and with the appropriate form for a plan
map amendment and zone change. Additionally, an Existing Conditions Site Plan is included in
Appendix 4 as required by the application form.

County staff will have 30 days to review the application for completeness following submittal.
Following the initial review period, the County staff will notify RLC if additional materials or
information are needed for the application to be accepted as complete for processing. When the
application is accepted as complete, the County will schedule the public hearings before the
Planning Commission and Board of Commissioners and provide mailed notification in
accordance with the requirements in Section 1402.

Yamhill County no longer has planning advisory committee(s) to review land use applications.
However, RLC will present an overview of the application at a public meeting before the
Yamhill County SWAC and expects that the SWAC may provide a recommendation on the
proposed PA/ZC to the Planning Commission and Board of Commissioners.

Because the application involves a PAPA, the County must also provide notice of the
application to DLCD at least 35 days prior to the first scheduled public hearing.45 As a plan
amendment, this application would not be subject to statutory requirements to make a final local
decision within 150 days of receiving a complete application. Additionally, approval of a PA/ZC
requires a public hearing and final decision by the Board of Commissioners pursuant to YCZO
1208.01.C. No appeal would be required to elevate consideration of the application to the Board.

In summary, the applicant has met all of the requirements for the Type C procedure as set forth
in Section 1301 of the Yamhill County Zoning Ordinance.


45
  ORS 197.610 requires local governments to provide DLCD with advance notice of proposed comprehensive plan or land
use regulation amendments.

B. Section 1208 ­ Quasi-Judicial Zone District Boundary Changes
Section 1208 of the Ordinance outlines general requirements and review criteria for quasi-
judicial zone district boundary changes. This application proposes two interrelated quasi-judicial
map and zoning district boundary changes, as shown in Table 8.

                                           Table 8.   Proposed PA/ZC
                                      Map Change       Tax Lot #   Acres
                                      PWS to EFU       5501-101    7.1

                                      PWS to EFU       5501-200    211.2

1. 1208.01           General Requirements
     A quasi-judicial zone map change is processed as follows:

     (A) An amendment may be initiated by the Board, the Commission, or by application of
         an owner of land.
Response: This quasi-judicial map change was initiated by application of RLC, the owner of the
subject parcels included in the proposed amendment (Map 5501 -Tax Lots 101, 200 and 401).

     (B) The application for such a change by an owner of land shall be made in accordance
         with the Type C application procedure.
Response: The applicant has followed the steps outlined for the Type C procedure, as
summarized under Section 1300 above.

     (C) Such amendments shall be made only by the Board, after review and
         recommendation by the Commission. When the request includes a Comprehensive
         Plan map amendment, both the Commission and Board shall hold public hearings,
         pursuant to Section 1402 of this Ordinance, prior to the Board making a final
         decision. When the request does not include a Comprehensive Plan map amendment,
         the Commission shall hold a public hearing to review and make a decision on the
         proposed zone map amendment. The Board is not required to hold an additional
         public hearing, but may make a decision based upon the record of the Commission
         hearing. In either case, the zone map amendment shall not be final until the Board
         has adopted the amendment by ordinance.
Response: This application proposes a consolidated amendment to the Comprehensive Plan
Map and Zoning Map. Therefore, public hearings before both the Planning Commission and
Board of Commissioners are required before the Board makes a final decision. The public
hearings would be held in accordance with the requirements of Section 1402 of the Zoning
Ordinance.

     (D) Approval for a boundary change shall include findings satisfying the criteria in
         1208.02 or 1208.03, as appropriate, and addressing applicable Comprehensive Plan
         goals and policies.
Response: The findings to address the review criteria in Section 1208.02 are addressed below.
The review criteria in 1208.03 apply to amendments from EFU to Agriculture/Forestry Zones
and are not applicable to this proposal. The findings to address the zone change criteria also
incorporate by reference the related findings addressing the Statewide Planning Goals (see
Section III) and findings to address compliance with the Yamhill County Comprehensive Plan
(see Section IV).

2. 1208.02                    Review Criteria
     A quasi-judicial change to a zoning map may be authorized, pursuant to Subsection 1208.01,
     provided that the request satisfies all applicable requirements of this ordinance, and also
     provided that the applicant demonstrates compliance with the following criteria, except as
     provided in Subsection 1208.03:

     (A) The proposed change is consistent with the goals, policies and any other applicable
         provisions of the Comprehensive Plan.
Response: Findings to address why the proposed zone change(s) are consistent with the goals,
policies, and other applicable provisions of the Yamhill County Comprehensive Plan are
provided in Section IV of this application narrative and are incorporated herein by this reference
to demonstrate compliance with this criterion.

     (B) There is an existing, demonstrable need for the particular uses allowed by the
         requested zone, considering the importance of such uses to the citizenry or the
         economy of the area, the existing market demand which such uses will satisfy, and
         the availability and location of other lands so zoned and their suitability for the uses
         allowed by the zone.

Response: The particular use allowed by the requested zone is the maintenance, expansion and
enhancement of a solid waste disposal facility. As shown in Figure 1, RLC proposes to rezone
about 218 acres (Portion of Tax Lot 101 and Tax Lot 200) from PWS to EFU so the existing
landfill permitted area and all ancillary landfill uses will be wholly located within the EFU zone.
RLC also proposes to rezone 25 acres of Tax Lot 401 from RC to EFU so that all contiguous
parcels in the same tract will be located in the single EFU zone and will not be divided by zoning
boundaries. RLC is proceeding with the PA/ZC as a necessary first step in the land use
permitting process.

ORS 215.283(2)(k) authorizes a county to approve a "site for the disposal of solid waste" on
land zoned EFU. Prior to 2011, Yamhill County's zoning ordinance only allowed a solid waste
disposal facility in the PWS zone, and did not allow such facilities in its EFU zone. In 2008, RLC
applied to the county to expand the landfill onto neighboring land zoned EFU. In 2009, the

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                              Page 94
Riverbend Landfill                                                                             September 2013
county found there was a need to expand the landfill and approved a reasons exception to
Statewide Planning Goal 3 (Agricultural Land) and rezoned the neighboring land to PWS. LUBA
reversed the county's decision on the grounds that an exception is not appropriate to allow a use
that Goal 3, and ORS 215.283(2)(k) already allow on agricultural lands.

Following guidance provided by LUBA and the Court of Appeals, Yamhill County amended its
EFU zone in 2011 to add a new section (V) to YCZO 402.02 to allow:

           "The maintenance, expansion or enhancement of an existing site on the
           same tract for the disposal of solid waste for which a permit has been
           granted under ORS 459.245 by the Department of Environmental
           Quality, together with the equipment, facilities or buildings necessary for
           its operation. The use must satisfy the standards set forth in ORS
           215.296(1)(a) and (b) and the standards set forth in Section 1101, Site
           Design Review. The maintenance, expansion or enhancement of an
           existing use on the same tract on high-value farmland is permissible only
           if the existing use is wholly within a farm use zone. No other Yamhill
           County Zoning Ordinance criteria or Comprehensive Plan goal or policy
           shall apply as an approval standard for this use."

Therefore, the particular use i.e., a site for the disposal of solid waste, is now a permitted use in
the County's EFU zone, consistent with state statute and Administrative Rules.

There is a need for the continued operation of Riverbend Landfill at this site. The new zoning
will allow RLC to maintain its existing facility ownership within a single zone, and will provide
RLC the opportunity to submit a subsequent Site Design Review application for a future
expansion onto the same tract. Ultimately, the purpose of the PA/ZC and Conceptual
Expansion Plan (see Figure 2) is to maintain, enhance and maximize the substantial solid waste
infrastructure that already exists at this location so the landfill and associated facilities can
continue to meet the solid waste management and disposal needs of the County and the existing
service area for the next 15 to 20 years.

The County has previously determined the market need for the continued operation of
Riverbend Landfill. As part of its approval of RLC's 2008 expansion application, the County
determined that the three in-depth economic analyses of the County's waste disposal options
(RLC's application, the JR Miller Report and the Zia Report) each concluded that there is a need
for the landfill disposal of solid wastes and that Riverbend Landfill is the most economical
option for meeting that need for the County. The County also concluded at that time that
Riverbend Landfill has a high importance to the citizenry of the County through the economic
benefits that the landfill generates for the County.

Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
Safe, efficient, and cost-effective collection, transportation, and disposal of solid waste is a
critical element of the overall infrastructure needed to support existing and planned
development at the local, regional, and statewide level. Residential, commercial, industrial, and
institutional users all expect and depend on regular and convenient pickup of solid waste and
recyclables. Even with the strong conservation ethic and commitment to solid waste reduction,
recovery, and recycling in Oregon, landfill disposal sites that can comply with stringent
environmental regulations are needed and will continue to be needed to accommodate residual
wastes.

Local disposal options for municipal solid waste have been a long-standing and important
component of the County's infrastructure. Since 1994, the County has acknowledged that RLC
would operate Riverbend Landfill as a regional landfill, serving neighboring counties and
utilizing out-of-county waste as a means to reduce and to stabilize solid waste disposal rates for
the County's residential, commercial and industrial generators of solid waste. This arrangement
became a central component of the County's SWMP, which was updated in 2004 and more
recently in 2008.

RLC has operated Riverbend Landfill since 1994 and provided substantial economic and other
benefits to the County. Riverbend Landfill serves an existing market demand for a local disposal
site that accommodates the needs of all residential, commercial, industrial and institutional
sectors of Yamhill County, urban and rural. Riverbend Landfill will reach capacity by 2017. RLC
is pursuing several tracks to assure that it can continue to meet the existing need and market
demand and minimize disruption of the County's well-established solid waste management
system.

To provide capacity in the short term, RLC is building a MSE berm and diverting dry waste to
WM's Hillsboro facility. In the long-term, RLC expects to propose an expansion on its property.
The expansion will be smaller than the one proposed in 2008 and there will not be an increase in
landfill height. In addition, RLC is reserving approximately 25 acres of the Future Expansion
Area for some type of Green Technology. Information on one of the potential Green
Technology options under consideration by RLC is included in Appendix 3.

Approval of the PA/ZC to EFU will provide the opportunity for RLC to propose a future
expansion. The concept for the future expansion outlined by RLC will satisfy an existing market
demand and contribute to a healthy economy in the County and the larger region. This finding is
based in part on the detailed economic analysis contained in the ECONorthwest Report (2013)
that documents the importance of the landfill to citizens, businesses and the overall economy of
Yamhill County. Among the conclusions in that report are:



Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                       Page 96
Riverbend Landfill                                                                      September 2013
           Cost of disposal. Hauling waste to any of the three alternative disposal sites would
           cause the per-ton cost of disposal to increase for County residents and businesses. The
           annual cost of disposal to the entire County would increase by $3.5 to $5.1 million
           (depending on the alternative site). The increased costs are caused by the additional cost
           of managing waste at a transfer station and hauling the waste to the alternative sites.
           Fees to Yamhill County. If Riverbend Landfill expands, RLC would continue to pay
           licensing and host fees to the County. Under a new licensing agreement approved in
           2012, it is estimated these fees will provide more than $1.2 million in annual revenue to
           the County. That revenue supports about two-thirds of the County's Solid Waste Fund
           budgeted expenses, and pays for post-closure costs of the closed landfills in the County,
           solid waste education programs, household hazardous collection, and other programs. If
           Riverbend Landfill closes, the County would no longer collect licensing and host fees
           from RLC. Instead, the County would collect license fees from a new transfer station,
           estimated to be between $64,000 and $94,000 per year.
           Employment and income from construction. RLC will spend approximately $25.5
           million to expand Riverbend Landfill. The construction activity will generate 202 jobs
           directly associated with construction activities and $6.1 million in associated personal
           income. The construction activity will generate secondary jobs and income impacts, as
           the construction and its employees purchase goods and services in the local economy. In
           total, construction of the expansion will generate 263 jobs and $7.7 million in associated
           income. Under the alternative disposal scenarios, a $2 million transfer station will be
           constructed, creating 29 jobs (23 or which are directly associated with construction
           activities) and $869,000 in associated income.
           Employment and income from operations. Operating Riverbend Landfill currently
           requires 17 full-time equivalent jobs, generating $1.6 million in associated personal
           income per year. Operating Riverbend Landfill yields secondary jobs, as the landfill and
           its employees purchase goods and services in the local economy. It is estimated that
           operating Riverbend Landfill generates 19 secondary jobs and $500,000 in personal
           income, for a total of 36 jobs and $2.1 million in personal income. Hauling waste to
           alternative sites would create between 14 and 19 jobs, associated with operating the
           transfer station and transporting the waste to alternative sites, and would generate
           between $900,000 and $1.2 million in personal income (depending on the alternative
           site). Between 11 and 14 of those jobs would be directly employed in transfer station
           operations and hauling the waste.
           Electricity generation. RLC is currently generating and selling electricity to
           McMinnville Water and Light by combusting landfill gas. The landfill gas from
           Riverbend Landfill creates a capacity of 4.8 megawatts, enough to power about 2,500


Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                         Page 97
Riverbend Landfill                                                                        September 2013
           Oregon homes. Expanding Riverbend Landfill would extend electricity generation over a
           longer time period.
           Air emissions from hauling waste. Hauling solid waste from the County to any of the
           three alternative disposal sites generates carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx),
           carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter. Expanding Riverbend Landfill avoids the
           generation of transportation-related greenhouse gases and pollutants that decrease air
           quality. The economic costs of the increased pollutant emissions are between $28,000
           and $297,000 per year for CO2, between $23,000 and $200,000 per year for NOx; and
           between $28,000 and $242,000 per year for particulate matter.
           Green Technology facility. RLC is exploring development of a Green Technology
           facility in the Future Expansion Area. The specific facility RLC is pursuing would
           generate a fuel source that emits less carbon than coal per BTU of energy generated and
           have the following economic benefits:

                Construction of the facility would generate an estimated 89 jobs directly associated
                with constructing the facility and $2.8 million in personal income. The construction
                activity and its workers would create additional jobs and income by purchasing local
                goods and services, creating a total of 110 temporary jobs and $3.4 million in
                personal income.
                Operating the facility would generate an estimated 43 jobs directly associated with
                operating the facility and hauling the material to a port and $3.8 million in personal
                income, per year. The facility and its employees would generate additional jobs and
                income by purchasing local goods and services, creating a total of 88 permanent jobs
                and $5.0 million in personal income, per year.
                The facility would reduce total CO2 emissions by about 33,000 metric tons per year,
                which has an economic value between $1.3 million and $3.7 million.
           While it is Waste Management's vision to construct and operate this green technology
           facility at Riverbend Landfill, the construction of any particular facility depends on many
           factors including; proven commercialization of the technology, financial viability of the
           project, and ability to receive all necessary permits within the current the regulatory
           structure.
Finally, there are only two zones in the County that allow a MSW landfill as a permitted or
conditional use, the PWS zone and the EFU zone. An inventory of existing tax lots zoned PWS
is included in Appendix 1. The County has a total inventory of about 425 acres currently zoned
PWS, with more than half of that inventory associated with the PWS zoning at Riverbend
Landfill. The balance of the PWS inventory is comprised of smaller sites (average of 7.33 acres)



Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                          Page 98
Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
and the majority of the zoned tax lots are committed to existing uses such as cell towers, water
storage tanks, and power substations.

As shown in Figure 1, Tax Lot 200 includes a total of 211 acres zoned PWS, including
approximately 75 acres extending south of the existing permitted landfill to and across the South
Yamhill River. This area is within the 100-year floodplain and floodway areas. While the existing
PWS zoning would theoretically allow landfill expansion toward the river, natural site constraints
and environmental regulations limit its suitability for that use. It would not be feasible for RLC
to obtain County or DEQ permits for a future expansion into this undeveloped area that is
currently zoned PWS. RLC proposed to rezone this floodplain and floodway area to EFU in the
2008 application for these same reasons. Therefore, there are no sites already zoned PWS that
are large enough or suitable for the particular landfill use for location, size or other reasons.

The County's EFU zone is more limited than ORS 215.283. YCZO 402.02(V) only permits "the
maintenance, expansion or enhancement of an existing site on the same tract for the disposal of
solid waste for which a permit has been granted under ORS 459.245 by the Department of
Environmental Quality.... The maintenance, expansion or enhancement of an existing use on
the same tract on high-value farmland is permissible only if the existing use is wholly within a
farm use zone." (Emphasis added).

Riverbend Landfill is the only existing solid waste site in Yamhill County that has been granted a
permit by DEQ as a MSW landfill. There are eight other sites in Yamhill County with solid
waste permits issued by DEQ under ORS 459.245. Appendix 2 includes Facility Detail Reports
and Zoning Maps for each of the eight sites. Key findings regarding the existing sites are
summarized below:

           One of the permits is for the Waste Management MSW transfer station within the
           Newberg UGB (zoned PWS).
           One of the permits is for the Recology recycling/material recovery facility within the
           City of McMinnville (zoned Industrial).
           One of the permits is for the Recology NW Greenlands yard debris composting facility
           within the City of McMinnville (zoned Industrial).
           One of the permits is for an industrial wood waste facility adjacent to the City of
           Willamina (zoned Industrial)
           Four of the permits are for on-site compost operations associated with farm uses (EFU
           and RI zoning). These four permits are for registration only under 2009 DEQ rules, and
           do not include an operations plan.
Riverbend is the only existing facility with a DEQ permit to dispose of MSW. The other existing
facilities with DEQ permits serve very different and specialized roles in Yamhill County's solid

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                      Page 99
Riverbend Landfill                                                                     September 2013
waste management system, including waste recovery, waste transfer and recycling, yard debris
composting and on-site composting associated with farm uses. Only Riverbend has the long
history of operation as a MSW landfill and has in place the necessary infrastructure to continue
such operations. Only Riverbend Landfill is designed to operate as a modern landfill in full
compliance with Subtitle D regulations and with sufficient area to meet the County's existing
and future disposal needs.

In summary, there is a demonstrable need for the continued operation of Riverbend Landfill.
Riverbend Landfill's continued operation is important to the citizenry and the economy of the
entire County because it provides a local, low cost, environmentally-sound option for solid waste
disposal that keeps disposal costs low for all customers and helps businesses and industry to
remain profitable. The only zones that permit a landfill are the PWS zone and the EFU zone
(with limitations). The County does not maintain reserves of land zoned PWS and existing PSW
zones are too small to accommodate a new landfill. The portion of Tax Lot 200 within the
floodway that is zoned PWS is not appropriate or feasible for landfill expansion and is more
appropriately zoned EFU. Riverbend Landfill is the only existing facility with a DEQ permit that
is approved for disposal of municipal solid waste. None of the other sites in the County with
DEQ solid waste permits and that are zoned EFU have infrastructure in place to accommodate
a MSW landfill and they are not a suitable or appropriate alternative to rezoning Riverbend
Landfill to EFU for the specific landfill use.

     (C) The proposed change is appropriate considering the surrounding land uses, the
         density and pattern of development in the area, any changes which may have
         occurred in the vicinity to support the proposed amendment and the availability of
         utilities and services likely to be needed by the anticipated uses in the proposed
         district.
Response: As described earlier in this narrative and shown in Figure 1, RLC is proposing two
interrelated zoning map changes:

     1. Rezone approximately 7.1 acres of Tax Lot 101 and 211.2 acres of Tax Lot 200 from
        PWS to EFU; and
     2. Rezone approximately 25 acres of Tax Lot 401 from RC to EFU.
Approval of the PA/ZC to EFU will be consistent with the pattern of zoning in the area, which
is primarily EFU.

The character and density of development in the surrounding areas have not changed
substantially since the early 1980s when the Yamhill County Comprehensive Plan was
acknowledged by the LCDC. With high-value agricultural soils, relatively large farm operations
and minimum lot size restrictions associated with EFU zoning, the surrounding area has largely

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                            Page 100
Riverbend Landfill                                                                            September 2013
been maintained in agricultural uses and relatively large parcels. Additionally, urbanization has
not extended toward the landfill and is highly unlikely to do so. As noted earlier, the Yamhill
County Comprehensive Plan Map and Zoning Map have reflected a large base of PWS zoning
(more than 200 acres) at this location since 1980. If Yamhill County had allowed landfills in the
EFU zone as authorized by state law in 1980, it is likely that Riverbend Landfill would have been
established in the EFU zone and never would have been zoned PWS.

Notwithstanding the zoning, there is a long history of landfill-related uses at this location. The
County-owned Whiteson Landfill operated for many years immediately south of the South
Yamhill River until it closed in the early 1980s. Riverbend Landfill has been operating at this
location with DEQ and County zoning, franchise, and solid waste disposal permit approvals for
more than 30 years, with RLC operating the landfill since 1994. Operation of a solid waste
landfill at this location is not a new use, and uses in the surrounding area have coexisted with the
landfill operation for many years.

As explained in Section I (Historical Context) Subtitle D rules for MSW landfills took effect on
October 9, 1993 and required significant investments to install groundwater monitoring wells,
build synthetic liners below landfills, provide leachate treatment facilities, construct landfill gas
collection and destruction systems, and provide sufficient funds to close and monitor landfills
for a period of 30 years after closure. Riverbend Landfill is a multi-million dollar, modern, state-
of-the-art landfill with DEQ-approved environmental systems that haves allowed the facility to
operate in compliance with all applicable permits and regulations. The site is engineered with
overlapping environmental protection systems to safely contain waste in the landfill and provide
full protection for groundwater as well as surface water. The infrastructure and established
landfill use and facilities that exist at Riverbend Landfill support this PA/ZC application and can
be leveraged with the conceptual future expansion so the landfill can continue to serve the
county for another 15-20 years.

RLC currently owns a total of approximately 700 acres at Riverbend Landfill, including the
existing landfill and contiguous parcels to both sides of Highway 18. RLC purchased many of
these parcels to provide a "buffer" between the landfill and surrounding uses. Over the past
year, RLC has been working with the community on an exciting "Stewardship Project" involving
approximately 450 acres owned by RLC in the vicinity of Riverbend Landfill that RLC has
committed to not use for future expansion (see Figure 3). RLC is working with a Stewardship
Committee to define a long-term vision for the Stewardship Lands and identify potential future
uses and partnerships that could benefit the local community. RLC and the Stewardship
Committee are maintaining a commitment to the agricultural and resource base of the
community and will maintain the EFU zoning and continue farming and farm-related uses on


Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                       Page 101
Riverbend Landfill                                                                       September 2013
the Stewardship Project lands. Therefore, the Stewardship Project will provide an opportunity to
retain and enhance the agricultural resource character of the area surrounding the landfill.

Other changes have occurred recently in the vicinity of the closed Whiteson Landfill. The
County has approved a day use park (in the EFU zone) and BPA has purchased another parcel
that will be placed in a conservation easement and managed by Ducks Unlimited. Combined
with the Stewardship Project lands in the vicinity of the river -- recent trends point to a greater
emphasis on habitat enhancement, open space and recreational improvements (including trails
and river access) in proximity to the South Yamhill River.

The PA/ZC to EFU and the proposed future expansion would not require any utilities and
services beyond what is already provided for the existing landfill. The landfill does not require
public water or sanitary sewer service and the use is appropriately characterized as a rural use.

RLC has an approved access point to Highway 18 that can accommodate the PA/ZC area and
conceptual future expansion as summarized in the Traffic Impact Report (provided in
Attachment B). RLC has constructed improvements to accommodate safe and orderly access
into and out of the landfill. Existing improvements include a left turn refuge and
acceleration/deceleration lane at the driveway entrance. RLC also added weigh scales and an
additional driveway lane in 2006 to expand the area available for queuing of vehicles and trucks
off of the highway.

In 2008, RLC proposed a larger landfill expansion area. RLC is committed to understanding
neighbor's concerns and addressing them. RLC has hosted 17 community meetings over the past
year, and has listened and responded to community input by changing operations and programs.
Specific areas in which RLC has responded include:

           Changes in operating hours;
           Expansion and enhancement of gas management system;
           New falcon program for bird management;
           New diversion strategies to reduce the amount of waste going to the landfill;
           New licensing agreement that pays the county considerably more for out-of-county
           waste;
           Efforts to bring Green Technology solutions to Yamhill County and Riverbend; and
           Reducing visual impacts by replacing tarps (intermediate cover) with soil and
           implementing a pilot project to plant grass seed on slopes (where tarps used to be).
Based on community input, RLC has also substantially modified the conceptual future expansion
relative to the 2008 proposal. Similar to the prior application, the conceptual Future Expansion
Area is still defined by clear natural and man-made boundaries ­ including Highway 18 on one

Plan Amendment and Zone Change Narrative                                                        Page 102
Riverbend Landfill                                                                        September 2013
side and the riparian floodplain/floodway boundaries on other sides. The conceptual Future
Expansion Area for the landfill is about half the size of the 2008 proposal. Additionally, RLC is
reserving a site for a potential Green Technology facility that could further reduce residual waste
disposal volumes, consistent with solid waste management priorities.

RLC is proceeding with this PA/ZC to EFU as a first step. RLC understands that any future
expansion would be subject to rigorous review by the community, the County and DEQ. For all
of these reasons, the proposal to rezone the subject parcels from PWS and RC to EFU will allow
the existing disposal area and all ancillary facilities to be wholly located within the EFU zone.
This is appropriate in the context of the history of 1) existing uses, development, and
infrastructure at Riverbend Landfill, 2) surrounding land uses and 3) the density and pattern of
development in the area.

     (D) Other lands in the County already designated for the proposed uses are either
         unavailable or not as well-suited for the anticipated uses due to location, size or
         other factors.
Response: Under the YCZO, a sanitary landfill is permitted only in the PWS zone and the EFU
zone. Prior to 2011, Yamhill County only permitted landfills in the PWS zone. As authorized by
state law, the County amended its EFU zone to allow "the maintenance, expansion or
enhancement of an existing site on the same tract for the disposal of solid waste for which a
permit has been granted under ORS 459.245 by the Department of Environmental Quality..."
The County's EFU zone is more limited that state law, and only allows the maintenance,
expansion or enhancement of existing facilities on EFU land, and doesn't authorize new solid
waste facilities in the EFU zone.

Therefore, the following lands in the County must be considered for the proposed landfill use:
    Sites zoned PWS
    Sites with existing DEQ solid waste permits (ORS 459.245) that are wholly within the
       EFU zone
PWS Sites

An inventory of existing tax lots zoned PWS is included in Appendix 1. The County has a total
inventory of about 425 acres currently zoned PWS, with more than half of that inventory
associated with the PWS zoning at Riverbend Landfill. The balance of the PWS inventory is
comprised of smaller sites (average of 7.33 acres) and the majority of the zoned tax lots are
committed to existing uses such as cell towers, water storage tanks, and power substations. The
closed Whiteson Landfill (42 acres) located south of the river is also zoned PWS.

EFU Sites with Existing DEQ Solid Waste Permits

Riverbend Landfill is the only existing solid waste site in Yamhill County that has been granted
an operating permit by DEQ as a MSW landfill. There are eight other sites in Yamhill County
with solid waste permits issued by DEQ under ORS 459.245. Appendix 2 includes Facility
Detail Reports and Zoning Maps for each of the eight sites. Key findings regarding the existing
sites are summarized below:

           One of the permits is for the Waste Management transfer station within the Newberg
           UGB (zoned PWS).
           One of the permits is for the Recology recycling/material recovery facility within the
           City of McMinnville (zoned Industrial).
           One of the permits is for Recology's NW Greenlands yard debris composting facility
           within the City of McMinnville (zoned Industrial).
           One of the permits is for an industrial wood waste facility adjacent to the City of
           Willamina (zoned Industrial)
           Four of the permits are for on-site compost operations associated with farm uses (EFU
           and RI zoning). These four permits are for registration only under 2009 DEQ rules, and
           do not include an operations plan.
The existing sites that are already zoned PWS or existing sites zoned EFU with DEQ permits
issued under ORS 459.245 are not as well suited for the proposed solid waste landfill use for the
following location, size or other reasons.

Location Reasons
Riverbend Landfill has been operating at this location for more than 30 years. Before the
Riverbend Landfill opened in the early 1980s, the County-owned Whiteson Landfill operated in
the vicinity of the landfill in an area just south of the South Yamhill River. Therefore, there is a
long history and public awareness of the landfill use and activity at this particular location in the
County.

In addition to the long-standing commitment to landfill uses, the specific location of Riverbend
Landfill also provides the following advantages for the particular landfill use relative to
alternative sites that are zoned PWS or that are zoned EFU (with approved DEQ permits):

           Riverbend Landfill is centrally located to serve both rural and urban customers;
           Riverbend Landfill is located more than 2 miles of the closest city (McMinnville) and is
           not adjacent to urban use areas. Some of the existing sites with DEQ permits are located
           inside or adjacent to cities and urban areas (McMinnville and Willamina);

           With its location adjacent to Highway 18, vehicle trips associated with the landfill are
           concentrated on the state highway system instead of County roads. Some of the other
           sites that are zoned PWS and EFU are located away from the state highway system.
           Natural and human-made features provided definitive borders around Riverbend
           Landfill, including the South Yamhill River floodplain and riparian areas and Highway
           18; and
           Agricultural uses around Riverbend Landfill have coexisted with the landfill operations
           for decades.
In summary, the Yamhill County Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Map have long recognized
this location near Highway 18 as the key focal point for large-scale PWS zoning and
landfill-related uses.

Size and Other Reasons
As shown in Appendix 1, the vast majority of the existing sites zoned PWS are very small. Out
of 58 tax lots that are currently zoned PWS, only nine are larger than 10 acres. The DEQ-
approved waste disposal area for Riverbend Landfill includes about 87 acres, and that acreage is
expected to be at capacity by 2017.

The PWS zoning for Riverbend Landfill currently applies to a total of about 200 acres. As
shown on Figure 1, the existing PWS zoning for Tax Lot 200 extends across the South Yamhill
River, much of which occurs within the 100-year floodway and floodplain areas. While the
existing PWS zoning would theoretically allow landfill expansion east of the existing disposal
area toward the river, natural site constraints, and environmental regulations limit its suitability
for that use. The 2008 application proposed to rezone this floodplain and floodway area from
PWS back to EFU and it would not be feasible for RLC to obtain permits for a landfill
expansion onto this area of Tax Lot 200.

There are a variety of engineering and economic reasons why landfills typically require large sites
of 100 acres or more and an operational life (capacity) of at least 20 years. State and federal
regulations establish significant long-term operational, closure, and post-closure requirements
for solid waste facilities. These requirements impose substantial costs on facility operators. A
large site and long-term operational period is necessary to generate the revenues that would
allow the facility to remain economically viable while meeting these requirements. Significant
time is required to site and permit a solid waste disposal facility. Permitting for a new solid waste
disposal site can require 5 or more years, with no assurance that a proposed facility can be sited,
permitted, and operated. Therefore, a proposed solid waste facility must be large enough and
have a long-term operational life to justify the siting and permitting effort.

There are many reasons for maximizing the active life of existing solid waste disposal facilities
that are located in close proximity to urban areas. Such facilities can provide a disposal site that

Riverbend Landfill                                                                         September 2013
is convenient and cost-effective for local residents and businesses. RLC has already made an
enormous investment in environmental monitoring and control infrastructure at Riverbend
Landfill, including numerous groundwater monitoring wells and landfill gas monitoring
collection and control facilities. This existing infrastructure can be leveraged and enhanced with
the landfill expansion rather than replicating the infrastructure on a new site.

The area currently owned by RLC is about 700 acres, and includes the existing landfill and
contiguous parcels. With approval of the PA/ZC to EFU, all of the parcels owned by RLC
would be zoned EFU, consistent with the pattern of zoning in the vicinity. RLC is working with
the community to identify appropriate uses and partners for approximately 450 acres of
"Stewardship Project" lands. Existing EFU zoning, along with farm and farm-related uses, will
be retained, although more intensive farm uses may be considered if they provide community
benefits. The State highway lands, forests, riparian areas, and farmlands surrounding Riverbend
Landfill provide a relatively unique opportunity to buffer the landfill.

In summary, other lands in the County that are already zoned PWS are not as well suited for the
potential use as a landfill because of location constraints and parcel size (existing PWS zoned
sites are about 7 acres and too small to provide the required long-term capacity for a modern
landfill). Therefore, the proposal to rezone the existing PWS and RC areas back to EFU is
appropriate for these reasons.

As described earlier, Riverbend Landfill is the only existing site in the County with an approved
DEQ permit for MSW disposal. Four other sites are zoned EFU and have DEQ permits for on-
site agricultural composting. None of these sites have a history of landfill operations or the
infrastructure required for a modern landfills that are in place at Riverbend Landfill. Therefore,
no other lands in the County that are already designated for the proposed landfill use (PWS sites
or EFU sites with approved DEQ permits) are as well-suited for use as a modern landfill.

     (E) The amendment is consistent with the current Oregon Administrative Rules (OARs)
         for exceptions, if applicable.

Response: A PA/ZC to EFU to allow a use (solid waste disposal site and ancillary uses) that is
permitted by statue, Goal 3 administrative rule and the County's EFU zone does not require an
exception.

VI.        Conclusion
Rezoning the existing landfill from PWS to EFU is consistent with state law and the County's
EFU zone. A solid waste disposal site is a permitted non-farm use under Oregon's planning
framework and the RLC has operated Riverbend Landfill since 1994 in compliance with County
land use and license approvals and DEQ permits. Rezoning approximately 25 acres from RC to
EFU is appropriate because the new zoning will allow RLC to maintain its existing facility
ownership within a single zone, and will provide RLC the opportunity to submit a subsequent
Site Design Review application for a future expansion onto the same tract.

Riverbend Landfill operates as a key component of the County's overall solid waste management
system and provides multiple benefits to the County, including but not limited to stable, family
wage jobs, lower disposal rates (relative to the alternative of hauling waste out of the County),
substantial licensing and host fee revenues to the County, and existing and anticipated future
capital investments.

Approval of the PA/ZC to EFU would allow RLC to submit a Site Design Review application
for a future expansion. The expansion would facilitate the continued operation of Riverbend
Landfill so it can meet the disposal needs of the service area for the next 15 to 20 years and
provide additional benefits to County residents, businesses, and public agencies. RLC has met
all County approval standards for the requested PA/ZC as noted below.

           There is an existing demonstrable need and market demand for the particular use. Although
           the County is making a strong effort to reduce and recycle solid waste, a disposal site is
           necessary for residual solid waste. The County has the advantage of a landfill located in
           its boundaries, and should leverage the investment in that landfill. The zone change and
           potential future expansion will give the County another 15 to 20 years of
           environmentally responsible disposal capacity.
           No other properly zoned area in the County can support a landfill development. A landfill
           can only be sited, maintained, expanded, or enhanced as an existing solid waste disposal
           site with an approved DEQ solid waste permit under ORS 459.245 on land zoned PWS
           or on land zoned EFU. No other PWS or EFU site in the County is suitable for a
           landfill because of location and size constraints, as well as other factors described in the
           narrative.
           Expanding Riverbend Landfill is the best available alternative, and its consequences are
           superior to any other alternative.

                The alternative to expanding Riverbend Landfill is a transfer station and long-haul
                trucking. The transfer station would not provide the economic and social benefits of
                Riverbend Landfill. Long-haul trucking would result in higher costs to the County,

                especially considering the rise in fuel prices, and would be less environmentally
                desirable than Riverbend Landfill.
                The long-term consequences strongly favor landfill expansion. Riverbend Landfill
                has a strong history of environmental compliance, and it is built to the highest
                regulatory standards. Riverbend Landfill is environmentally superior to long-haul
                trucking. From a social perspective, Riverbend Landfill would provide more family
                wage employment and business opportunities in the County. Traffic impacts would
                be minimal, while visual impacts could be mitigated. The economic advantages of
                having a landfill in the County are substantial.
                The energy impacts of the expansion are positive, relative to the alternatives. An
                expanded Riverbend Landfill would allow the continued generation of electricity
                from landfill gas for a longer period. Additionally, the conceptual Future Expansion
                Area reserves approximately 25 acres for an envisioned Green Technology facility.
                Expansion of Riverbend Landfill would be compatible with surrounding uses.
                Riverbend Landfill has operated at this location for more than 30 years and there is
                no evidence that the existing landfill has substantially impaired or conflicted with the
                use of farm or forest land. Rezoning the existing landfill from PWS to EFU will not
                materially change the established patterns of land uses in the immediate vicinity.
                Solid waste disposal sites are clearly contemplated as an appropriate and permitted
                non-farm use in the EFU zone.
Because RLC has met the applicable standards, as detailed and demonstrated in this narrative,
the County should approve the request for a PA/ZC from PWS and RC to EFU. Future County
and DEQ land use and permit approvals would be required before RLC could proceed with a
future expansion.

1 Executive Summary
The  Riverbend  Landfill  Company,  Inc.  (RLC),  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Waste  
Management,  intends  to  file  a  land  use  application  to  change  its  existing  zoning.  This  zone  
change  would  allow  the  Riverbend  Landfill  to  eventually  expand  its  footprint  and  total  
capacity.    

As  a  municipal  solid  waste  landfill,  Riverbend  Landfill  may  accept  solid  waste  collected  by  
households  and  businesses,  construction  and  demolition  debris,  and  non-hazardous  special  
waste.  In  addition  to  providing  disposal  services  to  Yamhill  County,  it  serves  communities  on  
the  Oregon  coast  and  portions  of  Multnomah,  Clackamas,  and  Washington  Counties.  

RLC  asked  ECONorthwest  to  analyze  the  economic  impacts  of  expanding  and  continuing  to  
operate  Riverbend  Landfill.    The  analysis  focuses  on  impacts  only  to  Yamhill  County.  The  
analysis  estimates  the  impacts  of  expanding  and  continuing  to  operate  Riverbend  Landfill  and  
compares  those  impacts  to  alternative  disposal  options.  Economic  impacts  result  from  operating  
the  Riverbend  Landfill,  based  on  the  assumption  that  it  would  accept  510,000  tons  of  waste  per  
year  through  2030.  Economic  impacts  also  result  from  construction  activity  associated  with  
expanding  the  Riverbend  Landfill,  estimated  to  cost  $25.5  million  (2013  dollars).  

Following  the  zone  change,  RLC  plans  to  aggressively  pursue  opportunities  to  develop  a  new  
"Green  Tech"  facility  at  Riverbend.  One  possible  Green  Tech  facility  would  convert  a  portion  of  
the  waste  stream  that  is  currently  landfilled  into  a  pelletized  fuel  source.    Such  a  facility  could  
create  a  marketable  energy  product,  reduce  residual  waste  disposal  volumes  and  maximize  the  
life  of  the  landfill.  Assuming  the  Green  Tech  facility  is  developed  by  late  2015,  the  projected  
landfill  capacity  would  last  until  about  2034.    This  analysis  examines  the  impact  of  constructing  
such  a  Green  Tech  facility  in  addition  to  any  expansion  of  the  existing  landfill  facility.    

If  Riverbend  Landfill  is  not  expanded  and  ceases  to  accept  waste,  Yamhill  County's  waste  
would  need  to  be  diverted  and  disposed  elsewhere.  This  analysis  assumes  a  new  transfer  
station  would  be  built  in  McMinnville  to  allow  the  diversion  of  waste  to  a  different  site  at  a  cost  
of  $2  million  (2013  dollars)  for  construction.  Yamhill  County's  waste  would  be  hauled  from  the  
new  transfer  station  to  one  of  three  alternative  disposal  sites.  The  three  alternative  sites  are:  
    · Coffin  Butte  Landfill.  Coffin  Butte  is  38  miles  from  McMinnville,  near  Corvallis.
    · Columbia  Ridge  Landfill  and  Recycling  Center.  Located  in  Gilliam  County,  Columbia  
      Ridge  is  183  miles  from  McMinnville.  
    · Wasco  County  Landfill.  This  landfill  is  123  miles  from  McMinnville,  near  The  Dalles  in  
      Wasco  County.  

Table  1  summarizes  the  economic  impacts  for  each  alternative  compared  to  the  continued  
operation  of  Riverbend  Landfill.  The  table  shows  that  expanding  Riverbend  Landfill  generates  
significant  and  clear  benefits  to  Yamhill  County  and  its  residents.  The  table  lists  the  types  of

ECONorthwest                                   Economic Impacts of Expanding Riverbend Landfill                    2
Expanding  Riverbend  Landfill  provides  large  economic  benefits  to  Yamhill  County  and  its  
residents.  The  costs  of  hauling  waste  are  lower,  many  more  local  jobs  and  associated  income  are  
generated,  and  the  County  generates  more  revenue  from  landfill  license  fees.  If  Riverbend  
Landfill  ceases  to  operate,  Yamhill  County  residents  would  not  only  pay  more  for  garbage  
service,  but  fewer  of  the  dollars  they  spend  on  garbage  service  would  stay  within  the  local  
economy.    

The  economic  impacts  are  the  following:  

    · Cost  of  disposal.  Hauling  waste  to  any  of  the  three  alternative  disposal  sites  would  cause  
      the  per-ton  cost  of  disposal  to  increase  for  Yamhill  County  residents  and  businesses.  The  
      annual  cost  of  disposal  to  the  entire  County  would  increase  by  $3.5  to  $5.1  million  
      (depending  on  the  alternative  site).  The  increased  costs  are  caused  by  the  additional  cost  
      of  managing  waste  at  a  transfer  station  and  hauling  the  waste  to  the  alternative  sites.  
    · Fees  to  Yamhill  County.  If  Riverbend  Landfill  expands,  RLC  will  pay  approximately  $1.2  
      million  per  year  in  licensing  and  host  fees  to  Yamhill  County.  That  revenue  supports  
      about  two-thirds  of  the  County's  Solid  Waste  Fund  budgeted  expenses,  and  pays  for  post-
      closure  costs  of  closed  landfills,  solid  waste  education  programs,  household  hazardous  
      waste  collection,  and  other  programs.  If  Riverbend  Landfill  closes,  the  County  would  no  
      longer  collect  licensing  and  host  fees  from  RLC,  but  it  would  collect  license  fees  from  a  
      new  transfer  station,  which  we  estimate  to  be  between    $64,000  and  $94,000  per  year.  
    · Employment  and  income  from  construction.  RLC  will  spend  $25.5  million  to  expand  
      Riverbend  Landfill.  The  construction  activity  will  generate  202  jobs  directly  associated  
      with  construction  activities  and  $6.1  million  in  associated  personal  income.  The  
      construction  activity  will  generate  secondary  jobs  and  income  impacts,  as  the  construction  
      and  its  employees  purchase  goods  and  services  in  the  local  economy.  In  total,  construction  
      of  the  expansion  will  generate  263  jobs  and  $7.7  million  in  associated  income.  Under  the  
      alternative  disposal  scenarios,  a  $2  million  transfer  station  will  be  constructed,  creating  29  
      (23  of  which  are  directly  associated  with  construction  activities)  jobs  and  $869,000  in  
      personal  income.      
    · Employment  and  income  from  operations.  Operating  Riverbend  Landfill  currently  
      requires  17  full-time  equivalent  jobs,  generating  $1.6  million  in  associated  personal  
      income  per  year  to  operate  the  facility.  Operating  Riverbend  Landfill  yields  secondary  
      jobs,  as  the  Landfill  and  its  employees  purchase  goods  and  services  in  the  local  economy.  
      We  estimate  that  operating  Riverbend  Landfill  generates  19  secondary  jobs  and  $500,000  
      in  personal  income,  for  a  total  of  36  jobs  and  $2.1  million  in  personal  income.  Hauling  
      waste  to  alternative  sites  would  create  about  half  as  many  jobs--operating  the  transfer  
      station  and  driving  the  waste  to  alternative  sites  would  generate  between  14  and  19  jobs  
      and  between  $900,000  and  $1.2  million  personal  income  (depending  on  the  alternative  
      site).  Between  11  and  14  of  those  jobs  would  be  directly  employed  in  transfer  station  
      operations  and  hauling  the  waste.    
    · Electricity  generation.  RLC  is  currently  generating  and  selling  electricity  to  McMinnville  
      Water  and  Light  by  combusting  landfill  gas.  Expanding  Riverbend  Landfill  would  extend

        its  ability  to  generate  electricity.  The  landfill  gas  from  Riverbend  Landfill  creates  a  
        generating  capacity  of  4.8  megawatts,  sufficient  to  generate  about  36,500  megawatt-hours  
        of  electricity.  This  is  enough  energy  and  capacity  to  power  2,500  homes.  The  electricity-
        generating  capacity  displaces  the  need  for  new  electrical  turbines  powered  by  natural  gas,  
        which  generate  additional  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  other  air  pollutants.  
     · Air  emissions  from  hauling  waste.  Hauling  solid  waste  from  Yamhill  County  to  any  of  
       the  three  alternative  disposal  sites  generates  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  nitrogen  oxides  
       (NOx),  carbon  monoxide,  and  particulate  matter.  Expanding  Riverbend  Landfill  avoids  
       the  generation  of  transportation-related  greenhouse  gases  and  pollutants  that  decrease  air  
       quality.  The  economic  cost  of  the  CO2  is  between  $28,000  and  $297,000  per  year;  the  cost  
       of  the  NOx  is  between  $23,000  and  $200,000  per  year;  and  the  cost  of  particulate  matter  is  
       between  $28,000  and  $242,000  per  year.  
     · Tourism  Impacts.  ECONorthwest  could  find  no  evidence  that  the  presence  or  absence  of  
       Riverbend  Landfill  had  any  impact  on  tourism  in  Yamhill  County.  
     · Green  Tech  facility.  The  Green  Tech  facility  would  generate  a  fuel  source  that  emits  less  
       carbon  per  BTU  of  energy  generated.  
           Construction  of  the  facility  would  generate  an  estimated  89  jobs  directly  associated  
           with  constructing  the  facility  and  $2.8  million  in  personal  income.  The  construction  
           activity  and  its  workers  would  create  additional  jobs  and  income  by  purchasing  local  
           goods  and  services,  creating  a  total  of  110  temporary  jobs  and  $3.4  million  in  personal  
           income.    
           The  facility  would  generate  an  estimated  43  jobs  directly  associated  with  operating  the  
           facility  and  hauling  the  material  to  a  port,  and  $3.8  million  in  personal  income,  per  
           year.  The  facility  and  its  employees  would  generate  additional  jobs  and  income  by  
           purchasing  local  goods  and  services,  creating  a  total  of  88  permanent  jobs  and  $5.0  
           million  in  personal  income,  per  year.  
           The  facility  would  reduce  total  CO2  emissions  by  about  33,000  metric  tons,  which  has  
           an  economic  value  between  $1.3  million  and  $3.7  million.  
  




ECONorthwest                         Economic Impacts of Expanding Riverbend Landfill                                4
2 Introduction
The  Riverbend  Landfill  Company,  Inc.  (RLC),  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Waste  
Management,  intends  to  file  a  land  use  application  to  change  its  existing  zoning.  This  zone  
change  would  allow  the  Riverbend  Landfill  to  eventually  expand  its  footprint  and  total  disposal  
capacity.    

Riverbend  Landfill  is  located  on  Highway  18,  about  two  miles  southwest  of  the  McMinnville  
city  limits.  As  a  municipal  solid  waste  landfill,  Riverbend  Landfill  may  accept  solid  waste  
collected  by  households  and  businesses,  construction  and  demolition  debris,  and  non-
hazardous  special  waste.  In  addition  to  providing  disposal  services  to  Yamhill  County,  it  serves  
communities  on  the  Oregon  coast  and  portions  of  Multnomah,  Clackamas,  and  Washington  
Counties.  

RLC  asked  ECONorthwest  to  analyze  the  economic  impacts  of  expanding  and  continuing  to  
operate  Riverbend  Landfill.  This  report  summarizes  ECONorthwest's  analysis.  The  analysis  
estimates  the  impacts  of  expanding  Riverbend  Landfill  and  compares  those  impacts  to  
alternative  disposal  options.  This  report  examines  only  a  subset  of  the  potential  impacts  of  an  
expanded  Riverbend  Landfill:  it  focuses  on  describing  and,  as  possible,  quantifying  economic  
impacts  to  Yamhill  County.  


2.1 Evaluation Methods and Data
The  evaluation  used  the  following  sources  of  information:  
    · Interviews  with  waste  haulers  that  deliver  waste  to  Riverbend  Landfill.  ECONorthwest  
      interviewed  key  RLC  staff  to  understand  the  amount  of  waste  delivered  to  Riverbend  
      Landfill  and  contacted  RLC  competitors  to  determine  the  expected  cost  of  delivering  the  
      waste  to  alternative  disposal  sites.  
    · Interviews  with  County  staff.  ECONorthwest  interviewed  Solid  Waste  staff  at  Yamhill  
      County  to  understand  the  fiscal  impacts  of  the  Riverbend  Landfill  to  the  County.  
    · Landfill  operations  data  from  RLC.  ECONorthwest  worked  with  staff  at  RLC  to  
      understand  Riverbend  Landfill  operations.  
    · National  data  sources.  ECONorthwest  relied  on  federal  agencies  for  electricity  and  air  
      emissions  data.  

The  text  of  this  report  provides  a  full  description  of  the  data  and  methods  used  to  determine  the  
economic  impacts  of  expanding  the  Riverbend  Landfill.    


2.2 Organization of the Report
After  this  introductory  chapter,  the  remainder  of  this  report  is  organized  into  two  chapters  and

3 Evaluation Framework
This  chapter  discusses  principles  that  are  fundamental  to  an  economic  impact  analysis.  It  has  
two  sections:  

    · Key  Issues  Affecting  this  Analysis  discusses  the  key  issues  that  affect  the  logic  and  
      assumptions  of  an  economic  impact  analysis.  
    · Alternatives  describes  the  different  alternatives  used  in  the  analysis  to  compare  economic  
      impacts.  


3.1 Key Issues Affecting this Analysis
This  section  discusses  assumptions  that  affect  an  analysis  of  economic  impacts.  

    · Identify  the  base  case.  To  estimate  the  net  benefits  of  expanding  Riverbend  Landfill,  the  
      benefits  and  costs  of  one  possible  future  (with  an  increased  capacity  at  the  Riverbend  
      Landfill)  must  be  compared  to  the  benefits  and  costs  that  would  occur  in  a  different  future  
      (without  the  increased  capacity).  Such  evaluation  usually  occurs  by  comparing  alternative  
      scenarios  to  the  `base  case.'  In  this  analysis,  the  `base  case'  assumes  that  RLC  expands  
      Riverbend  Landfill.  
    · Identify  study  area  boundaries.  Different  types  of  impacts  affect  different  geographies.  In  
      the  case  of  a  landfill,  the  cost  of  disposal  affects  the  landfill's  entire  service  area.  Although  
      some  economic  effects  may  occur  elsewhere,  the  focus  of  this  analysis  is  on  Yamhill  
      County.  The  analysis  identifies  the  economic  impacts  that  affect  Yamhill  County's  
      residents,  businesses,  and  county  government.    
    · Properly  attribute  causality.  Establishing  a  base  case  affects  an  analyst's  ability  to  
      properly  identify  cause-and-effect  relationships.  Attributing  effects  to  causes,  and  doing  
      so  only  once  (i.e.,  avoiding  double  counting),  is  essential  to  an  evaluation  of  net  impacts.  
    · Clarify  timing  of  impacts.  Economic  effects  occur  over  time.  Some  impacts  are  single  
      events,  such  as  the  construction  of  a  transfer  station.  Other  impacts  are  ongoing,  such  as  
      the  annual  license  fees  paid  to  Yamhill  County.  This  analysis,  conducted  in  2013,  is  based  
      on  2013  data  and  estimates  jobs,  income,  tax  revenue,  and  other  factors  based  on  2013  
      values.  This  analysis  identifies  impacts  that  are  one-time,  and  those  that  are  ongoing,  but  
      does  not  estimate  future  values.  Instead,  the  analysis  describes  the  ongoing  impacts  in  
      2013  dollars,  and  notes  that  the  impacts  would  continue  on  an  annual  basis  into  the  
      future.  


3.2 Alternatives
The  analysis  of  economic  impacts  is  organized  to  compare  the  base  case  of  expanding  
Riverbend  Landfill,  to  hauling  the  waste  to  other  landfills  in  the  region.  This  section  describes  
assumptions  used  in  the  analysis  of  the  alternatives.  


ECONorthwest                         Economic Impacts of Expanding Riverbend Landfill                                 7
3.2.1 Expand Riverbend Landfill
Riverbend  Landfill  accepts  municipal  solid  waste  generated  from  households  and  businesses.  
The  Riverbend  Landfill  provides  disposal  services  for  Yamhill  County  and  outside  the  County.    

RLC  estimates  that  510,000  tons  of  waste  will  be  disposed  at  Riverbend  Landfill  in  2013  and  
annually  into  the  future.  We  use  510,000  tons  per  year  to  estimate  economic  impacts.  RLC  
estimates  that  Yamhill  County  residents  and  businesses  generate  24.8%  (126,500  tons)  of  the  
total  annual  volume  of  waste  disposed  at  Riverbend  Landfill.1  

RLC  will  eventually  apply  to  expand  the  Riverbend  Landfill  by  3.5  million  cubic  yards  of  
capacity,  or  4.1  million  tons.  RLC  reports  that  the  eventual  expansion  is  expected  to  cost  $25.5  
million  (in  2013  dollars).    

There  are  currently  17  employees  at  Riverbend  Landfill,  and  the  total  value  of  the  income  for  
those  employees  (wages  plus  the  cost  of  providing  benefits)  equals  $1.6  million.  This  analysis  
assumes  the  landfill  will  require  this  level  of  employment  throughout  its  operating  life.  

RLC  has  built  a  system  to  capture  methane  gas  generated  in  the  Riverbend  Landfill  by  
decomposing  waste  and  convert  it  to  usable  electricity.  The  expansion  would  extend  the  time  
that  the  Riverbend  Landfill  can  be  used  to  generate  electricity.    

Different  alternative  technology  processes  exist  that  RLC  could  pursue  at  Riverbend  Landfill  to  
recover  waste  that  currently  gets  disposed  in  a  landfill.    The  Green  Tech  process  most  likely  to  
work  at  the  Riverbend  Landfill  site  is  a  technology  Waste  Management  has  developed  to  create  
a  fuel  from  waste  that  serves  as  a  substitute  for  coal.    Waste  Management  has  constructed  
similar  facilities  at  other  landfills,  and  plans  to  site  such  a  facility  at  Riverbend  Landfill  if  the  
expansion  proceeds.  This  particular  type  of  facility  takes  the  non-recyclable  waste  and  sorts  it,  
so  that  about  one-third  (170,000  tons  per  year)  can  be  converted  to  fuel  pellets.  The  remainder  
would  be  disposed  in  the  Riverbend  Landfill.    For  the  purposes  of  this  study,  we  call  this  facility  
the  Green  Tech  facility.  

Waste  Management  reports  that  it  will  cost  $31  million  to  construct  the  Green  Tech  facility  and  
that  operating  it  will  require  35  employees.  The  total  value  of  their  wages  and  benefits  is  $3.29  
million.  

3.2.2 Haul Waste to other Landfills
If  Riverbend  Landfill  does  not  expand,  it  will  no  longer  accept  waste.  The  area  currently  served  
by  Riverbend  Landfill  would  need  to  find  alternative  disposal  options.    




                                                                                
                                                                                                              

   1     All  data  describing  Riverbend  Landfill  facilities  were  provided  by  Waste  Management  staff.  




ECONorthwest                                                                                                     Economic Impacts of Expanding Riverbend Landfill   8
This  analysis  assumes  that  the  waste  collected  in  Yamhill  County  by  garbage  collection  vehicles  
will  need  to  be  transferred  to  larger,  long  haul  trucks.  A  new  transfer  station  would  need  to  be  
constructed  to  provide  that  transfer  capacity.2  We  assume  that  the  new  transfer  station  would  
be  built  in  the  vicinity  of  McMinnville,  but  we  have  not  identified  a  specific  location  for  this  
hypothetical  scenario.  

Staff  at  RLC  estimated  that  a  new  transfer  station,  sized  to  accommodate  waste  generated  in  
Yamhill  County,  would  cost  roughly  $2  million  (in  2013  dollars)  to  construct.  This  cost  estimate  
assumes  that  the  facility  is  relatively  simple  and  does  not  include  any  materials  recovery  
capability.  This  cost  estimate  excludes  the  cost  of  any  compacting  equipment.  

This  analysis  assumes  the  new  transfer  station  would  require  six  employees  for  operations  and  
the  total  value  of  the  income  for  those  employees  (wages  plus  the  cost  of  providing  benefits)  
equals  $564,000  per  year.  

This  analysis  considers  three  alternative  locations.  Figure  1  shows  the  location  of  Riverbend  
Landfill  and  the  three  alternative  landfills. 1  

          · Coffin  Butte  Landfill.  Coffin  Butte  is  38  miles  from  McMinnville,  near  Corvallis.

            Ridge  is  183  miles  from  McMinnville.  
          · Wasco  County  Landfill.  This  landfill  is  123  miles  from  McMinnville,  near  The  Dalles  in  
            Wasco  County.  




                                                                                
                                                                                                              

   2     The  existing  transfer  station  in  Newberg  is  not  large  enough  to  accommodate  all  of  Yamhill  County's  waste.

4 Economic Impacts
This  chapter  is  organized  into  nine  sections,  each  describing  a  different  type  of  economic  
impact.  For  each  impact,  we  discuss  the  economic  impacts  associated  with  expanding  
Riverbend  Landfill  and  those  associated  with  transporting  waste  to  an  alternative  site  for  
disposal.  The  nine  types  of  impacts  are:  

          1. Cost  of  Disposal  
          2. Yamhill  County  Fees  
          3. Employment  and  Income-Construction  
          4. Employment  and  Income-Operations  
          5. Electricity  
          6. Air  Emissions  from  Hauling  Waste  
          7. Tourism  Impacts  
          8. Green  Tech  Facility  
          9. Other  Impacts  


4.1 Cost of Disposal
If  Riverbend  Landfill  does  not  continue  to  operate,  the  waste  would  be  transferred  to  long-haul  
trucks  at  a  transfer  station,  and  then  hauled  to  the  alternative  landfills.  To  estimate  the  cost  of  
disposal,  ECONorthwest  calculated  the  per-ton  hauling  costs  and  added  the  tipping  fee  and  
compared  those  costs  to  disposing  waste  at  Riverbend  Landfill.  Table  3  summarizes  the  
calculations,  which  were  based  on  the  following  assumptions.  

          · Travel  time.  ECONorthwest  used  travel  times  from  McMinnville  as  estimated  by  
            maps.google.com  (shown  in  Table  2)  and  rounded  up  the  travel  times  to  half-hour  
                         3
            increments.     We  also  added  an  hour  to  each  trip  to  account  for  the  time  required  to  
            unload  the  waste  at  its  destination.    
          · Travel  cost.  ECONorthwest  multiplied  the  travel  time  by  $102  per  hour.  The  costs  include  
                                                                           4
            the  time  to  bring  the  empty  truck  back  to  McMinnville.   
          · Tons  per  trailer.  Waste  transported  to  Coffin  Butte  would  likely  be  in  an  open-top  
            container  with  an  average  load  weight  of  about  27  tons.  Waste  hauled  to  Columbia  Ridge  



                                                                                
                                                                                                              

3   The analysis coverts travel times to half-hour increments to show realistic travel costs. Although a portion of the waste stream will
likely be processed at the existing Newberg transfer station, we used McMinnville as a point of origin to estimate travel costs.

costs to haul solid waste. The cost includes the cost of the truck and the driver.

          · Transfer  Station  fee.  Managing  the  waste  at  the  McMinnville  Transfer  Station  will  cost  
            approximately  $10  per  ton.  
          · Tipping  fee.  ECONorthwest  interviewed  staff  at  three  alternative  landfills  to  determine  
            the  public  tipping  fee.

The  estimated  disposal  cost  for  the  three  alternative  disposal  sites  ranges  from  approximately  
$65  to  $78  per  ton,  or  $35  to  $47  per  ton  higher  than  Riverbend  Landfill.  

RLC  estimates  that  the  Riverbend  Landfill  will  accept  510,000  tons  per  year  and  Yamhill  County  
residents  and  businesses  will  generate  24.8%  of  the  waste  stream  (126,500  tons  per  year).    

Table  4  shows  the  total  cost  of  disposing  waste  to  the  residents  and  businesses  of  Yamhill  
                                                                                    6
County  for  Riverbend  Landfill  and  the  three  alternative  disposal  sites.   The  annual  cost  of  
disposal  for  Riverbend  Landfill  assumes  that  Waste  Management  collects  two-thirds  of  Yamhill  
County's  waste  and  Western  Oregon  Waste  collects  the  remaining  one-third.  The  portion  
collected  by  Waste  Management  includes  a  $10  per-ton  fee  associated  with  moving  that  garbage  
through  a  transfer  station  for  transport  to  Riverbend  Landfill.  

The  total  cost  of  disposal  increases  by  $5.1  million  for  Coffin  Butte,  $3.5  million  for  Columbia  
Ridge,  and  $3.8  million  for  Wasco  County.  This  is  the  increase  in  disposal  costs  for  all  garbage  
customers  across  Yamhill  County.  Not  only  will  the  costs  increase,  but  also  the  revenue  that  
funds  disposal  will  no  longer  be  part  of  the  Yamhill  County  economy.

The  increased  cost  of  disposal  would  affect  the  households  and  businesses  that  currently  
dispose  waste  at  Riverbend  Landfill.  To  estimate  the  impacts  to  Yamhill  County  residents,  
ECONorthwest  relied  on  current  fees  that  households  are  charged  by  Waste  Management.  

ECONorthwest  assumed  that  the  average  household  generates  31  pounds  of  garbage  per  week,  
or  1,612  pounds  per  year  (0.806  tons).7    The  basic  monthly  service  fee  for  residential  customers  
of  Waste  Management  is  $18.48  per  month,  or  $222  annually.  Based  on  a  $30.40  per-ton  tipping  
fee,  $24.50  of  the  annual  fee  pays  for  the  disposal  cost.  The  remainder  of  the  fee  covers  the  cost  
of  collecting  the  waste.  If  we  compare  the  disposal  costs  across  the  alternatives,  costs  for  
households  increase  between  13%  and  17%.  Commercial  customers  that  generate  large  volumes  
of  waste  are  likely  to  see  a  greater  increase  in  costs  because  disposal  accounts  for  a  larger  
portion  of  total  costs.  Individual  accounts  would  see  varied  increases  in  rates,  depending  on  the  
cost  structure  of  collection.  


4.2 Yamhill County Fees
This  section  describes  how  the  alternatives  affect  the  revenue  generated  to  Yamhill  County  from  
license  and  franchise  fees.  Yamhill  County  charges  three  types  of  fees  that  would  be  affected  by  
the  changes  to  Riverbend  Landfill.  

          · In-County  Waste  License  Fee.  RLC  pays  the  County  $1.60  per  ton  for  all  solid  waste  
            generated  within  Yamhill  County  that  is  delivered  to  Riverbend  Landfill.  
          · Out-of-County  Waste  License  Fee.  RLC  pays  the  County  $2.60  per  ton  for  all  solid  waste  
            generated  outside  of  Yamhill  County  that  is  delivered  to  Riverbend  Landfill.  
          · Transfer  Station  Franchise  Fee.  There  is  one  existing  transfer  station  in  Yamhill  County.  
            The  Newberg  Transfer  Station  pays  a  franchise  fee  equal  to  2%  of  gross  receipts.  

Yamhill  County  also  collects  franchise  fees  for  solid  waste  collection,  but  those  collection  
franchise  agreements  are  independent  of  any  disposal  options  within  the  County.  


                                                                                
                                                                                                              

   7     WOW reported to ECONorthwest that the typical residential customer in McMinnville generates between 28 and 34 pounds of waste
         per week.  




ECONorthwest                                                                                                     Economic Impacts of Expanding Riverbend Landfill   13
In  the  2012  Fiscal  Year,  Riverbend  Landfill  generated  almost  $1.1  million  in  license  fees  to  
Yamhill  County  (see  Table  5).

The  solid  waste  fees  support  the  Solid  Waste  Fund  at  Yamhill  County.  The  revenue  generated  
by  Riverbend  Landfill  accounts  for  91%  of  the  budgeted  new  revenue  for  the  Solid  Waste  Fund  
                                8
for  the  2013-14  Fiscal  Year.   Total  budgeted  costs  for  personnel  and  materials  and  services  in  the  
current  fiscal  year  are  about  $1.6  million.  The  budgeted  fees  generated  by  Riverbend  Landfill  
cover  about  two-thirds  of  the  Solid  Waste  Fund's  budgeted  expenses.  
                                                                                                                                                    9
The  Solid  Waste  Fund  supports  many  of  the  County's  costs:   
          · Post-closure  costs  associated  with  two  closed  landfills--Newberg  and  Whiteson.  
            Budgeted  post-closure  costs  for  the  2013  fiscal  year  are  $960,000.  
          · Planning  staff--the  Solid  Waste  Fund  supports  3.1  full-time  equivalents  (FTE)  of  County  
            Planning  staff,  including  1.0  FTE  of  a  Code  Enforcement  Official  and  1.0  FTE  of  a  
            Management  Analyst.  
          · Household  hazardous  waste  collection  program.  
          · Roadside  cleanup  and  cleanup  of  illegal  dumpsites.  
          · Solid  waste  and  recycling  education  programs.  

The  Green  Tech  facility  will  reduce  the  amount  of  waste  disposed  at  the  Riverbend  Landfill.  
This  analysis  does  not  estimate  the  expected  license  fees  paid  to  Yamhill  County  from  such  a  
facility.  Waste  Management  expects  that  the  license  fee  agreement  with  the  County  would  
change  to  take  into  account  the  altered  waste  stream  volume.  

4.2.1 Expand Riverbend Landfill
If  Riverbend  Landfill  expands,  Yamhill  County  will  continue  to  receive  license  fees  from  
Riverbend  Landfill.  The  current  license  fee  structure  is  based  on  tons  of  waste  disposed.  The  
Green  Tech  facility  will  significantly  alter  the  amount  of  waste  disposed  in  the  landfill.  This  

                                                                                
                                                                                                              

8   As reported in the Yamhill County Budgetary Revenue and Expense Worksheet for Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2014
(http://www.co.yamhill.or.us/). The total revenue for the Solid Waste Fund is $4.86 million, but $3.71 million of that is the beginning
balance, carried over from the previous year. Expected new revenues equal $1.15 million.

analysis  does  not  speculate  about  a  new  fee  structure  agreed  upon  between  RLC  and  Yamhill  
County  for  a  combined  Riverbend  Landfill  and  Green  Tech  facility.    

In  this  analysis,  we  assume  that  the  Riverbend  Landfill  will  receive  510,000  tons  of  waste  per  
year  for  disposal,  and  in-county  residents  and  businesses  will  generate  24.8%  of  that  waste.  By  
applying  the  in-county  and  out-of-county  waste  license  fee  rates  to  the  waste  stream,  we  
estimate  that  Riverbend  Landfill  will  generate  almost  $1.2  million  per  year  in  fees  (see  Table  6).

4.2.2 Haul Waste To Other Landfills
If  Riverbend  Landfill  does  not  expand,  a  new  transfer  station  would  likely  be  needed  to  
accommodate  waste  generated  in  the  area.  This  analysis  assumes  that  transfer  station  would  
generate  a  franchise  fee  for  the  County  similar  in  structure  to  the  franchise  fee  the  Newberg  
Transfer  Station  pays  Yamhill  County  (i.e.,  2%  of  gross  receipts).  

This  analysis  assumes  that  the  County  would  continue  to  receive  franchise  fees  from  the  
Newberg  Transfer  Station,  and  there  would  be  no  change  in  that  revenue  stream.  The  analysis  
also  assumes  that  the  County  would  continue  to  collect  franchise  fees  for  the  collection  of  waste,  
and  there  would  be  no  change  in  that  revenue  stream.  

To  estimate  the  fees  associated  with  a  new  transfer  station  in  McMinnville,  ECONorthwest  
assumed  that  all  the  waste  generated  in  Yamhill  County  (132,600  tons  in  2012)  would  be  hauled  
to  the  existing  Newberg  Transfer  Station  and  the  hypothetical  new  transfer  station.  We  assume  
the  transfer  stations'  gross  revenues  equal  the  total  tons  generated  in  Yamhill  County  times  the  
per-ton  cost  to  manage  and  transport  the  waste.  The  total  costs  are  shown  in  Table  3.  We  apply  
the  2%  franchise  fee  to  that  gross  revenue.  Table  7  shows  that  the  estimated  gross  revenue  
generated  from  the  Yamhill  County  waste  stream  and  the  associated  revenue  from  a  franchise  
fee.  This  analysis  estimates  that  the  alternative  landfills  would  generate  between  approximately  
$67,000  and  $98,000  in  revenue  to  the  County.

The  above  calculation  assumes  the  franchise  fee  is  2%  of  gross  revenues,  and  that  gross  
revenues  include  the  transfer  station  fee  and  the  cost  of  transporting  the  waste  to  a  disposal  site.  
It  is  possible  that  this  over-estimates  franchise  fee  revenue.  The  transfer  station  would  not  
necessarily  be  responsible  for  transporting  the  waste;  a  separate  company  could  contract  for  
that  portion.    

The  calculation  may  also  over-estimate  franchise  fees  because  it  assumes  that  all  waste  
generated  in  Yamhill  County  will  go  through  a  transfer  station.  It  is  likely  that  large,  industrial  
waste  producers  will  have  their  waste  delivered  to  a  landfill  in  a  long-haul  truck  directly  from  
their  own  facility.  That  waste  will  not  go  through  a  transfer  station  and  the  County  will  not  
receive  any  franchise  fee  revenue.  


4.3 Employment and Income-Construction

the  Riverbend  Landfill.

through  an  economy  from  one  sector  to  the  next.  Ultimately,  the  models  determine  the  number  
of  jobs,  amount  of  income,  and  dollars  of  economic  output  that  can  be  traced  to  the  initial  
project.  Appendix  A  provides  more  information  about  measuring  economic  impacts  using  
input-output  models.    

4.3.1 Expand Riverbend Landfill
If  Riverbend  Landfill  is  expanded,  construction  activity  will  include  the  expansion  activity  and  
the  planned  Green  Tech  facility.  This  section  of  the  analysis  calculates  the  employment  and  
income  impacts  associated  with  only  the  landfill  expansion  activity.  

RLC  has  estimated  the  total  cost  of  expanding  the  Riverbend  Landfill  to  be  $25.5  million  (2013  
          11
dollars).   The  expenditure  would  be  made  over  a  multiple-year  period.  This  analysis  estimates  
the  total  jobs  and  income  impacts,  not  per-year  impacts.  




                                                                                
                                                                                                              

   10   ECONorthwest used IMPLAN (for IMpact Analysis for PLANning) software to conduct the input/output analysis for the construction
      spending. IMPLAN was developed by the Forest Service of the US Department of Agriculture in cooperation with the Federal
      Emergency Management Agency and the Bureau of Land Management of the US Department of the Interior to assist federal agencies
      in their land and resource management planning. U.S. government agencies, other public agencies, and private firms including
      ECONorthwest have applied the model to a wide variety of public and private sector projects.

ECONorthwest                                                                                                     Economic Impacts of Expanding Riverbend Landfill        16
To  estimate  the  impacts  of  constructing  the  new  Riverbend  Landfill  space,  we  relied  on  Waste  
Management's  estimates  of  expenditures  by  category.  We  assigned  the  categories  to  industrial  
sectors,  as  defined  by  the  input-output  model.    

The  total  cost  is  based  on  the  following  elements:  

          · Excavation  and  perimeter  berm--$13.0  million.  We  assumed  these  costs  are  in  the  `other  
            new  construction'  category.
          · Liner  system  and  leachate  system--$4.6  million.  We  assumed  that  35%  of  these  costs  are  
            in  the  `other  new  construction'  category  and  the  remainder  are  in  `high  density  
            polyethylene  liner  manufacturing,'  `steel,  iron  pipe  manufacturing,'  and  the  `pumping  
            equipment  manufacturing'  categories.  Only  the  `other  new  construction'  category  has  
            firms  in  Yamhill  County.  Therefore,  all  costs  in  the  other  categories  have  no  local  
            impacts--the  expense  is  made  outside  of  Yamhill  County.    
          · Final  cover  system--$2.1  million.  We  assumed  that  costs  for  the  gas  system  are  evenly  
            divided  between  `other  new  construction'  and  `high  density  polyethylene  liner  
            manufacturing,'  but  there  are  no  firms  in  the  `high  density  polyethylene  liner  
            manufacturing'  industry  in  Yamhill  County.  
          · Gas  system--$1.5  million.  We  assumed  that  costs  for  the  gas  system  are  evenly  divided  
            between  `other  new  construction'  and  `gas  field  extraction  machinery,'  but  there  are  no  
            firms  in  the  `gas  field  extraction  machinery'  industry  in  Yamhill  County.    
          · Contingency  (20%)--$4.3  million.  We  applied  the  contingency  amount  proportionally  to  
            the  four  categories.    

Table  8  shows  the  employment  and  income  impacts  in  Yamhill  County  stemming  from  the  
addition  of  space  at  Riverbend  Landfill.  The  table  shows  the  number  of  jobs  resulting  from  
                                                                          12
construction  spending  in  two  categories:  primary  and  secondary.   

          · Primary  effects  are  those  directly  generated  by  the  construction  project.  They  include  the  
            jobs  and  income  earned  by  the  workers  building  the  landfill.  
          · Secondary  effects  are  those  indirectly  generated  by  the  construction  project.  They  include  
            the  jobs  and  income  earned  by  workers  in  industries  supplying  the  construction  project  
            and  jobs  and  income  earned  by  workers  servicing  the  direct  and  indirect  workers,  such  as  
            clothing  retailers  and  grocery  stores.  




                                                                                
                                                                                                              

   12   We use the terms primary and secondary to simplify the standard jargon of IMPLAN: direct, indirect, and induced. We combined
      IMPLAN's indirect and induced impacts under the heading of secondary impacts.

Table  8  shows  expanding  the  Riverbend  Landfill  will  create  a  total  of  202  jobs  directly  involved  
in  the  construction  process  and  an  overall  total  of  263  jobs.  These  jobs  will  be  spread  over  the  
time  it  takes  to  create  the  expanded  area  of  the  Riverbend  Landfill.    The  jobs  include  full-time  
and  part-time  jobs.  

The  Riverbend  Landfill  expansion  would  generate  $7.7  million  in  personal  income  over  the  
entire  construction  period,  and  those  workers  directly  involved  in  the  construction  process  
would  earn  $6.1  million  of  that.  Personal  income  includes  the  value  of  benefits  for  Yamhill  
County  residents,  and  excludes  income  generated  outside  Yamhill  County.  

4.3.2 Haul Waste To Other Landfills
If  Riverbend  Landfill  does  not  expand,  a  new  transfer  station  would  likely  need  to  be  
constructed  to  accommodate  waste  generated  in  the  area.  Based  on  the  volume  of  garbage  
generated  in  Yamhill  County,  RLC  staff  estimated  that  construction  cost  of  the  transfer  station  is  
$2  million.  This  does  not  include  the  cost  of  a  waste  compactor  used  at  the  transfer  station.  A  
compactor  would  be  purchased  from  a  non-local  manufacturer  and  would  have  no  impact  on  
the  Yamhill  County  economy.  

Table  9  shows  the  construction  of  a  transfer  station  would  create  23  jobs  directly  involved  in  the  
construction  process,  and  an  overall  total  of  29  jobs  created  as  a  result  of  the  construction.  The  
construction  of  the  transfer  station  would  generate  $869,100  in  personal  income,  and  those  
workers  directly  involved  in  the  construction  process  would  earn  $729,400  of  that  amount.  The  
jobs  and  income  associated  with  the  transfer  station  would  occur  once.  They  would  end  when  
construction  is  complete.

Construction  activities  associated  with  expanding  Riverbend  Landfill  creates  234  more  jobs  and  
generates  approximately  $6.8  million  more  personal  income  in  Yamhill  County  than  the  
alternatives.  


4.4 Employment and Income-Operations
This  section  describes  how  operations  activities  associated  with  the  alternatives  affect  the  
number  of  jobs  and  associated  personal  income  generated  in  Yamhill  County.    

If  Riverbend  Landfill  is  expanded,  operations  activity  will  include  operating  the  Riverbend  
Landfill  and  the  planned  Green  Tech  facility.  This  section  focuses  on  impacts  associated  with  
operation  of  only  the  Riverbend  Landfill.  See  Section  4.8  for  the  impacts  associated  with  
operating  the  Green  Tech  facility.    

4.4.1 Expand Riverbend Landfill
If  the  Riverbend  Landfill  is  expanded,  RLC  estimates  that  it  would  continue  to  require  17  full-
time  equivalent  (FTE)  permanent  employees  to  operate  the  Riverbend  Landfill.  RLC  estimates  
that  total  associated  personal  income  is  $1.6  million  per  year  (including  the  value  of  benefits).  

Table  10  shows  employment  and  income  impacts  in  Yamhill  County  stemming  from  operating  
the  Riverbend  Landfill.  The  table  shows  the  number  of  jobs  and  their  income  in  two  categories:  
                           13
primary  and  secondary.   

          · Primary  effects  are  those  directly  generated  by  operating  the  Riverbend  Landfill.  These  
            comprise  the  workers  employed  at  the  Riverbend  Landfill.  
          · Secondary  effects  are  those  indirectly  generated  by  operating  the  Riverbend  Landfill.  
            They  include  the  jobs  and  income  earned  by  workers  in  industries  supplying  the  landfill  
            (including  vendors  that  provide  goods  and  services  to  Riverbend  Landfill)  and  jobs  and  
            income  earned  by  workers  servicing  the  direct  and  indirect  workers,  such  as  clothing  
            retailers  and  grocery  stores.

The  table  shows  that  operating  the  Riverbend  Landfill  will  bring  a  total  of  36  jobs  to  Yamhill  
County;  17  of  those  are  directly  employed  in  Riverbend  Landfill  operations.    These  jobs  are  
considered  permanent  jobs,  and  will  exist  throughout  the  life  of  the  Riverbend  Landfill.  

4.4.2 Haul Waste To Other Landfills
If  Yamhill  County's  waste  is  hauled  to  one  of  the  alternative  landfills,  it  will  generate  jobs  at  the  
transfer  station  and  jobs  hauling  the  waste  in  trucks.  
       · RLC  estimates  the  transfer  station  would  require  six  full-time  equivalent  employees.  Total  
         associated  personal  income  is  $564,000  per  year.    
       · To  estimate  the  number  of  full-time  equivalent  jobs,  ECONorthwest  calculated  the  
         number  of  truck  trips  required  to  haul  121,300  tons  of  waste  to  the  three  alternative  
         disposal  sites  (based  on  data  reported  in  Table  2),  calculated  the  total  hours  to  haul  the  
         waste,  and  divided  the  total  by  2,080  working  hours  per  year  per  job.  ECONorthwest  
         multiplied  the  total  FTE  by  $55,454,  the  median  value  of  salary  and  benefits  for  a  heavy-

The  table  shows  that  operating  the  transfer  station  and  hauling  the  waste  to  alternative  sites  will  
bring  between  14  and  19  total  jobs  to  Yamhill  County,  depending  on  the  alternative  disposal  
site.  Between  11  and  14  of  those  jobs  are  directly  employed  in  transfer  station  operations  and  
hauling  the  waste.  All  these  jobs  are  considered  permanent  jobs.

Expanding  and  operating  Riverbend  Landfill  generates  significantly  more  jobs  and  income  than  
building  and  operating  a  transfer  station  and  hauling  the  waste  outside  of  the  County.  Table  13  
shows  total  jobs,  personal  income,  and  expenditures  in  Yamhill  County  associated  with  each  of  
the  alternatives.  Expanding  the  Riverbend  Landfill  generates  234  more  jobs  from  construction  
activities  and  between  17  and  23  more  jobs  for  operations.

A  by-product  of  a  landfill  is  landfill  gas,  which  contains  methane.  The  landfill  gas  can  be  
captured  and  combusted  for  energy.  RLC  has  developed  a  facility  to  generate  electricity  from  
captured  landfill  gas  and  works  with  McMinnville  Water  and  Light  to  deliver  the  electricity  to

                        15
captured  landfill  gas.   

The  facility  has  a  generating  capacity  of  4.8  megawatts  (MW).  The  4.8  MW  of  capacity  can  
                                                                                16
generate  about  36,500  megawatt-  hours  (mWh)  of  electricity  per  year.   This  is  enough  
                                                          17
electricity  to  power  roughly  2,500  Oregon  homes.   

Extending  the  life  of  Riverbend  Landfill  will  allow  the  facility  to  continue  to  generate  this  
electricity.  

Developing  electricity-generating  capacity  has  other  environmental  benefits.  By  expanding  the  
capacity,  other  new  generation  facilities  may  not  be  needed  to  meet  growing  demand  for  
electricity.  The  landfill  gas  facility  is  most  likely  to  displace  electricity  generated  from  natural  
gas.  Natural  gas-fired  turbines  generate  additional  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  other  air  
pollutants.  This  analysis  does  not  quantify  those  impacts.  


4.6 Air Emissions from Hauling Waste
Hauling  waste  to  alternative  landfills  will  generate  increased  emissions  of  air  pollutants  as  
heavy  trucks  travel  the  greater  distance.  This  section  quantifies  emissions  generated  by  hauling  
waste  to  alternative  disposal  sites  and  estimates  economic  values  for  some  of  those  emissions.  

The  US  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  has  developed  a  computer  model  (MOVES)  to  
estimate  total  emissions  of  pollutants  generated  by  highway  vehicles  in  various  geographic  
      18
areas.   The  model's  inputs  include  ambient  temperature,  fuel  type,  vehicle  age,  vehicle  
condition,  and  other  factors  that  affect  emissions.  Using  the  MOVES  model,  the  EPA  estimated  
emissions  for  a  variety  of  highway  vehicle  types,  including  heavy-duty  trucks.  

For  the  estimate  of  average  in-use  emissions  for  heavy-duty  trucks,  the  EPA  assumed  an  
average,  properly  maintained  heavy-duty  truck,  running  on  diesel  fuel,  operating  on  the  road  
on  a  warm  summer  day  in  July  2008.  Actual  emissions  for  any  individual  truck  will  vary.  For  
example,  a  newer  truck  will  generally  have  lower  emissions  and  an  older  truck  will  have  higher  
emissions.  

The  EPA  calculated  emission  rates  for  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  carbon  monoxide  
(CO),  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx),  particulate  matter  under  10  microns  diameter  (PM10),  and  
particulate  matter  under  2.5  microns  diameter  (PM2.5),  sometimes  referred  to  as  `fine  
                                                                                
                                                                                                              

   15   Generating electricity from landfill gas converts methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, to carbon dioxide. The burning of the landfill
      gas greatly reduces the greenhouse gas emissions generated by a landfill. This analysis does not calculate the value of those emissions
      because RLC is required to flare the landfill gas.

This  section  estimates  the  economic  value  of  CO2,  NOx,  and  PM2.5  emissions  that  would  be  
generated  by  hauling  waste  to  the  three  alternative  landfills.  

4.6.1 Carbon Dioxide Emissions
The  International  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  has  identified  anthropogenic  greenhouse  gas  
emissions  as  the  main  contributor  to  global  warming  and  climate  change.  CO2  emissions  have  
received  the  most  attention  as  they  account  for  the  majority  of  these  emissions  ­  77%  in  2004.20  
Expected  impacts  of  climate  change  include  decreased  ecosystem  resilience,  increased  
extinction  rates,  fluctuations  in  cropland  productivity,  increased  erosion  and  flooding  in  coastal  
areas,  and  decreased  availability  of  clean  drinking  water.  These  impacts  could  result  in  the  
displacement  of  hundreds  of  millions  of  people,  increased  morbidity,  and  irreversible  damages  
to  critical  life-support  systems  within  the  environment.

ECONorthwest                                                                                                     Economic Impacts of Expanding Riverbend Landfill   23
There  are  a  variety  of  methods  that  can  be  used  to  estimate  the  economic  value  of  reducing  CO2  
emissions.  One  data  source  comes  from  market  transactions.  Functioning  carbon  markets  exist  
in  parts  of  the  world  that  have  ratified  the  Kyoto  protocols,  and  in  some  U.S.  states  (e.g.,  
California)  where  local  regulatory  response  to  curbing  carbon  emissions  has  been  stronger  than  
at  the  federal  level.21  Another  way  to  estimate  the  value  of  reducing  CO2  emissions  is  quantify  
the  cost  of  the  damage  that  increasing  atmospheric  concentrations  of  CO2  and  resulting  climate  
changes  are  likely  to  cause  over  time.  This  measure,  known  as  the  social  cost  of  carbon  
represents  "the  full  global  cost  today  of  emitting  an  incremental  unit  of  carbon  at  some  point  of  
time  in  the  future,  and  it  includes  the  sum  of  the  global  cost  of  the  damage  it  imposes  on  the  
entire  time  it  is  in  the  atmosphere."22    

The  U.S.  EPA  established  a  range  of  values,  from  $12  to  $113  per  metric  ton  of  CO2  to  account  
for  the  social  cost  of  carbon  emissions  in  regulatory  analyses.  The  models  and  scenarios  used  to  
generate  this  range  take  into  account  different  discount  rates  and  a  variety  of  climate  change  
effects,  such  as  net  agricultural  productivity,  human  health  risk,  property  damage  from  
increased  flood  risk,  and  the  value  of  ecosystem  changes.23  For  this  analysis,  the  values  selected  
represent  a  3%  discount  rate  and  range  from  $40  to  $113  per  metric  ton  (in  2013  dollars).  This  
discount  rate  reflects  greater  emphasis  on  the  complete,  long-term  effects  of  carbon  dioxide  
emissions  today,  and  therefore  yields  a  greater  social  cost  of  carbon  than  a  higher  (short-term  
focused)  discount  rate.  There  is  a  95%  chance  that  the  actual  value  is  at  or  below  the  high  value.  
The  lower  end  reflects  the  average  value  across  all  models  and  scenarios.  

4.6.2 Other Emissions
Air  pollutants  emitted  by  diesel  trucks  can  negatively  impact  human  health  and  the  
environment.  This  analysis  focuses  on  the  value  of  two  pollutants:  Nitrogen  oxide  (NOx)  and  
particulate  matter  (PM2.5).  

Particulate  matter  (PM)  adversely  affects  human  health  by  increasing  the  incidence  of  asthma,  
respiratory  diseases,  cardiovascular  disease,  lung  cancer,  pre-term  and  low-birth  weights,  and  
premature  death.  Because  of  the  well-documented  risks  associated  with  PM  in  diesel  exhaust,  
the  U.S.  EPA  has  initiated  new  regulations  to  curb  fine  particulates  and  their  precursors.  
Research  supporting  these  regulations  suggests  that  the  national  average  monetizable  benefit  of  
reducing  PM2.5  from  air  emissions  from  on-road  mobile  sources  (such  as  diesel  trucks)  is  
$367,000-$826,000  per  ton  (2013  dollars).24  This  range  was  used  for  this  analysis.    It  should  be  
noted  that  this  value  is  derived  from  national  averages  for  health  effects,  population,  and

ambient  air  quality.  It  may  over  or  underestimate  the  actual  value  of  reducing  PM2.5  emissions  
in  the  areas  this  project  would  affect.  

Nitrogen  oxide  (NOx)  is  a  precursor  to  PM2.5  formation.  In  the  same  way  PM2.5  causes  health  
problems  in  the  population,  NOx  can  also  be  problematic.  Using  similar  techniques  to  estimate  
the  value  of  reducing  PM2.5,  the  U.S.  EPA  estimates  that  the  human-health  benefits  of  reducing  
NOx  range  from  about  $7,000  to  $16,000  per  metric  ton  (2013  dollars).    This  range  was  used  for  
this  analysis.  

NOx  also  contributes  to  the  formation  of  ozone,  which  also  has  human  health,  ecological,  and  
quality  of  life  benefits.  The  U.S.  EPA  indicates  that  these  values  are  not  reflected  in  the  value  
above,  but  that  "the  ozone  benefits  associated  with  reducing  NOx  could  be  substantial."  

In  2003,  the  U.S.  EPA  developed  a  market-based  `cap-and-trade'  program,  the  NOx  Budget  
Trading  Program  (NBP)  to  reduce  NOx  emissions  in  the  eastern  U.S.  In  2010,  this  program  was  
replaced  by  the  cap-and-trade  structure  set  forth  by  the  EPA's  Clean  Air  Interstate  Rule  (CAIR),  
then  in  2012  by  the  Cross-State  Air  Pollution  Rule  (CSAPR).  The  trading  program  affects  large  
                                                                                     25
stationary  sources,  such  as  electricity  generators  and  industrial  facilities.   The  program  does  
not  include  Oregon,  but  prices  for  emissions  allowance  provide  a  reasonable  proxy  for  the  value  
of  NOx  emissions.  The  CAIR  traded  885,025  tons  of  NOx  allowances  in  2010.26  The  price  for  a  
NOx  allowance  in  2011  has  dropped  considerably  from  recent  years,  with  allowances  trading  
near  $16  per  ton.27  

4.6.3 Cost Of Emissions
Table  16  shows  the  estimated  annual  economic  cost  of  emissions  that  would  be  generated  if  
Yamhill  County  must  haul  its  waste  to  any  of  the  three  alternative  landfills.  The  cost  of  
emissions  increases  as  the  distance  of  the  alternative  landfill  increases.

4.7 Tourism Impacts
Yamhill  County  is  the  leading  production  area  for  Oregon's  wine  industry,  and  several  studies  
have  identified  wine-related  tourism  as  the  main  driver  of  tourism  activities  in  Yamhill  
County.28  A  review  of  studies  on  tourism  in  Yamhill  County  by  ECONorthwest  yielded  no  
evidence  suggesting  that  Riverbend  Landfill  negatively  impacts  tourism  in  Yamhill  County.  
Analyses  by  Full  Glass  Research  (2011)  and  Barney  &  Worth,  Inc.  (2009)  both  recognize  several  
key  factors  that  could  affect  the  growth  of  wine-related  tourism  in  Yamhill  County,  but  neither  
points  to  Riverbend  Landfill  nor  other  waste  disposal  operations  as  deterrents  of  tourism  
growth.  

Figure  1  shows  the  total  amount  of  spending  by  visitors  in  Yamhill  County  from  2000  to  2012  
(in  current,  or  nominal,  dollars).  The  County  has  experienced  relatively  steady  positive  
spending  growth  in  most  years.  Total  tourism  spending  declined  in  2009,  during  the  severe

ECONorthwest  compared  the  tourism  industry  in  Yamhill  County  to  that  of  other  comparable  
counties  in  Oregon,  Washington,  and  California.  These  counties  are  either  similar  in  size  to  
Yamhill  County,  or  are  also  known  for  their  wine-related  tourism  and  wine  production.    

Figure  2  shows  the  average  annual  growth  rate  of  tourism-related  spending  in  Yamhill  and  
comparable  counties  in  Oregon  and  California,  from  2000  to  2011.  The  data  show  that  since  
2000,  Yamhill  County's  tourism-related  expenditures  have  outpaced  comparable  counties  in  
Oregon  and  California.  

Data  for  counties  in  Washington  state  are  only  available  through  2009.  From  2000  to  2009,  the  
average  annual  growth  rate  for  tourism-related  spending  in  four  counties  in  Washington  
(Benton,  Franklin,  Klickitat,  and  Walla  Walla)  exceeded  the  growth  rate  for  the  same  period  in  
Yamhill  County.

4.8 Green Tech
RLC  is  aggressively  pursuing  opportunities  to  develop  a  new  green  tech  facility  at  Riverbend.  
Such  a  facility  could  create  a  marketable  energy  product,  reduce  residual  waste  disposal  
volumes  and  maximize  the  life  of  the  landfill.    

Waste  Management  has  developed  a  system  to  create  a  fuel  from  waste  that  is  currently  
disposed  at  the  Riverbend  Landfill.  Waste  Management  has  constructed  similar  facilities  at  
other  landfills,  and  plans  to  site  such  facility  at  Riverbend  Landfill  if  the  expansion  proceeds.  
The  facility  takes  the  non-recyclable  waste  and  sorts  it,  so  that  about  one-third  (170,000  tons  per  
year)  can  be  converted  to  fuel  pellets.  The  remainder  would  be  disposed  in  the  Riverbend

Landfill.  For  the  purposes  of  this  study,  we  assume  the  Green  Tech  facility  at  Riverbend  
Landfill  will  consist  of  this  or  similar  technology.  

The  Green  Tech  facility  would  take  waste  that  is  currently  delivered  to  Riverbend  Landfill  and  
first  sort  it  before  disposal.  The  portion  of  the  waste  stream  that  is  diverted  from  the  Riverbend  
Landfill  would  be  processed  into  fuel  pellets,  which  can  be  used  to  generate  energy.  The  
primary  market  for  the  fuel  pellets  is  expected  to  be  facilities  that  require  fuel  to  create  a  
commodity,  such  as  a  cement  kiln.  

In  this  section,  we  describe  the  economic  impacts  associated  with  the  Green  Tech  facility,  
including  construction,  operation,  and  emissions.  

4.8.1 Construction Impacts
Waste  Management  reports  that  it  would  cost  $31  million  to  construct  the  Green  Tech  facility  
and  that  about  75%  of  this  figure  would  purchase  the  processing  equipment  and  25%  would  
purchase  the  building.  ECONorthwest  estimated  the  employment  and  income  impacts  
associated  with  constructing  the  industrial  building.  We  estimate  the  building  would  cost  $7.75  
million.  

Table  17  shows  the  construction  of  the  Green  Tech  facility  would  create  89  jobs  directly  
involved  in  the  construction  process,  and  an  overall  total  of  110  jobs  would  be  created  in  
Yamhill  County  as  a  result  of  the  construction.  The  construction  of  the  Green  Tech  facility  
would  generate  $2.8  million  in  personal  income  for  the  workers  directly  involved  in  the  
construction  process  and  a  total  of  $3.4  million  in  income  across  the  County.  The  jobs  and  
income  associated  with  the  Green  Tech  facility  would  occur  once  and  would  end  when  
construction  is  complete.

4.8.2 Operations Impacts
During  the  operations  period,  the  Green  Tech  facility  would  generate  jobs  and  income  in  two  
ways:  it  would  employ  individuals  in  the  processing  facility  and  it  would  employ  truck  drivers  
to  haul  the  product  to  its  market.    

    · Waste  Management  estimates  that  the  Green  Tech  facility  would  directly  employ  35  
      employees.  The  total  value  of  their  wages  and  benefits  is  $3.29  million  per  year.  
    · Waste  Management  estimates  that  the  Green  Tech  facility  would  generate  170,000  tons  
      per  year  of  outbound,  marketable  materials.  The  material  would  be  hauled  to  an

                     outbound  market;  in  this  analysis  we  assume  it  is  hauled  to  the  Port  in  Astoria,  Oregon,  
                     which  is  109  miles  from  Riverbend  Landfill  (drive  time  two  hours  and  22  minutes).30  To  
                     estimate  the  number  of  full-time  equivalent  jobs,  ECONorthwest  calculated  the  number  of  
                     truck  trips  required  to  haul  171,000  tons  of  waste  to  Astoria,  using  the  same  assumptions  
                     regarding  the  costs  to  haul  waste  that  we  used  in  Section  4.4,  Employment  and  Income-
                     Operations.31  We  calculated  the  total  hours  to  haul  the  waste  (including  an  hour  to  unload  
                     the  material),  and  divided  the  total  by  2,080  working  hours  per  year  per  job.  
                     ECONorthwest  multiplied  the  total  FTE  by  $55,454,  the  median  value  of  salary  and  
                                                                                     32

from  operating  the  Green  Tech  facility  and  hauling  the  outbound,  marketable  material  to  
Astoria.  The  table  shows  the  number  of  jobs  and  their  income  in  two  categories:  primary  and  
secondary.  

          · Primary  effects  are  those  directly  generated  by  operating  the  facility  and  hauling  the  
            product.  These  comprise  the  workers  employed  at  the  Green  Tech  facility  and  by  a  
            trucking  company.  
          · Secondary  effects  are  those  indirectly  generated  by  operating  the  Green  Tech  facility.  
            They  include  the  jobs  and  income  earned  by  workers  in  industries  supplying  the  facility  
            (including  vendors  that  provide  goods  and  services)  and  jobs  and  income  earned  by  
            workers  servicing  the  direct  and  indirect  workers,  such  as  clothing  retailers  and  grocery  
            stores.

The  table  shows  that  operating  the  Green  Tech  facility  and  hauling  the  marketable  material  to  
Astoria  would  bring  88  total  jobs  to  Yamhill  County  and  43  of  those  jobs  are  directly  employed  
in  Green  Tech's  operations  and  hauling  the  waste.  All  of  these  jobs  are  considered  permanent  
jobs.

4.8.3 Air Emissions from Hauling Marketable Material
Hauling  the  outbound,  marketable  product  from  Riverbend  Landfill  to  Astoria  would  generate  
emissions  of  air  pollutants  as  the  heavy  trucks  travel  to  and  from  the  Port.  This  section  
quantifies  those  emissions.  

We  use  the  same  methodology  as  described  in  Section  4.6,  Air  Emissions  from  Hauling  Waste.  
Please  refer  to  that  section  for  our  methods  to  estimate  the  total  emissions  and  their  economic  
value.    

Table  15  shows  the  estimated  annual  emissions  that  would  be  generated  by  hauling  the  
outbound  material  to  Astoria.  To  calculate  the  total  emissions,  ECONorthwest  assumed  that  
Riverbend  Landfill  would  generate  170,000  tons  per  year  of  marketable  product,  and  a  truck  
would  haul  a  34-ton  trailer.

4.8.4 Air Emissions from Utilizing Marketable Material
The  Green  Tech  facility  would  produce  a  fuel  that  can  be  used  in  place  of  coal.  In  this  section,  
we  compare  the  CO2  emissions  from  using  the  Green  Tech  product  as  a  fuel  to  using  coal  as  a  
fuel.    

To  compare  the  two  fuel  sources,  we  must  identify  the  `heat  value'  for  both  fuel  sources.  The  
heat  value  quantifies  the  amount  of  energy  contained  in  a  fuel  source.  Energy  analysts  use  
British  thermal  units  (BTUs)  to  compare  energy  in  different  fuel  sources.    

     ·     Waste  Management  reports  that  the  Green  Tech  material  would  have  a  heat  value  of  
           7,500  to  11,000  BTUs  per  pound  of  material.  In  this  analysis,  we  use  the  mid-point  of  the  
           range,  9,250  BTUs  per  pound.  




ECONorthwest                              Economic Impacts of Expanding Riverbend Landfill                         31
             ·            The  U.S.  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA)  reports  that  exported  coal  from  the  
                          U.S.  has  a  heat  value  of  12,823  BTUs  per  pound.33  

Waste  Management  estimates  that  the  Green  Tech  facility  at  Riverbend  Landfill  would  generate  
170,000  tons  of  marketable  product.  This  would  yield  3.145  trillion  BTUs  of  energy  annually.34  
We  estimated  that  it  would  require  122,636  tons  of  coal  per  year  to  produce  the  same  volume  of  
energy.    

The  EIA  reports  that  the  average  factor  for  carbon  emission  for  U.S.  coal  is  207.6.  A  carbon  
emission  factor  equals  the  pounds  of  CO2  emitted  per  million  BTUs.35  By  multiplying  the  
emission  factor  by  the  3.145  trillion  BTUs,  we  estimate  that  coal  would  emit  652,902,000  pounds  
per  year  of  CO2,  or  about  296,000  metric  tons.  

Waste  Management  reported  that  the  Green  Tech  product  emits  12%  less  CO2  than  coal.  To  
estimate  the  metric  tons  of  CO2  emitted  by  the  Green  Tech  product,  we  reduce  the  emissions  
from  coal  by  12%,  resulting  in  a  reduction  of  approximately  261,000  metric  tons  of  CO2  by  using  
the  Green  Tech  Facility  instead  of  coal.      

Table  21  shows  the  total  metric  tons  of  CO2  that  would  be  emitted  from  3.145  trillion  BTUs  of  
energy  generated  by  the  Green  Tech  product  and  coal.  The  table  also  shows  the  estimated  
economic  cost  of  the  CO2  emissions  for  both  products.36  The  table  shows  that  the  Green  Tech  
product  produces  fewer  CO2  emissions  than  coal,  for  the  same  energy  production.

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  volume  of  avoided  emissions  from  using  the  Green  Tech  product  
exceeds  the  emissions  from  hauling  the  product  to  Astoria  by  a  factor  of  124.

4.9 Other Impacts
The  expansion  area  of  Riverbend  Landfill  includes  the  area  that  is  currently  occupied  by  the  
Mulkey  RV  Park.  The  expansion  will  eliminate  the  existing  commercial  activity  at  the  site.    

The  operators  of  the  RV  Park  report  that  the  facility's  total  annual  revenue  is  $125,000  per  year.  
It  has  no  paid  employees.  

If  Riverbend  Landfill  is  expanded,  the  Mulkey  RV  Park  will  no  longer  generate  that  revenue.  It  
is  likely  that  some  of  its  customers  will  go  to  other  campsites  in  Yamhill  County.  The  economic  
impact  of  closing  the  RV  Park  is  likely  to  be  less  than  $125,000  per  year.

Appendix-Overview of Economic Multiplier Models
One  economic  modeling  framework  that  captures  the  direct,  indirect,  and  induced  effects  of  
spending  on  a  project  is  called  input-output  modeling.  Input-output  models  provide  an  
empirical  representation  of  the  economy  and  its  inter-sectoral  relationships.  

Because  input-output  models  generally  are  not  available  for  state  and  regional  economies,  
special  data  techniques  have  been  developed  to  estimate  the  necessary  empirical  relationships  
from  a  combination  of  national  technological  relationships  and  county-level  measures  of  
economic  activity.  This  planning  framework,  called  IMPLAN  (for  IMpact  Analysis  for  
PLANning),  is  the  technique  that  ECONorthwest  applied  to  the  estimation  of  impacts.  


The Origins of the IMPLAN Model
IMPLAN  was  developed  by  the  Forest  Service  of  the  US  Department  of  Agriculture  in  
cooperation  with  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  and  the  Bureau  of  Land  
Management  of  the  US  Department  of  the  Interior  to  assist  federal  agencies  in  their  land  and  
resource  management  planning.  U.S.  government  agencies,  other  public  agencies,  and  private  
firms  including  ECONorthwest  have  applied  the  model  to  a  wide  variety  of  public  and  private  
sector  projects.  

The  model  is  distinguished  from  typical  input-output  models  in  that  it  is  not  survey  based;  
survey-based  input-output  models  place  significant  demands  on  data,  and  are  uneconomical  to  
apply  in  most  situations.  Rather,  IMPLAN  employs  secondary  source  data,  available  by  state  
and  county,  to  define  a  model  for  any  region  in  the  United  States.  

Two  sources  of  data  are  particularly  central  to  the  IMPLAN  models:  the  National  Income  and  
Product  Accounts  published  annually  by  the  Bureau  of  Economic  Analysis  (BEA)  of  the  U.S.  
Commerce  Department,  and  the  BEA  input-output  model  for  the  United  States.  The  IMPLAN  
modeling  process  utilizes  the  national  input-output  model  and  county-level  economic  activity  
data  to  derive  input-output  models  for  units  as  small  as  a  county.  

The  process  that  develops  the  county-level  input-output  model  generates  coefficients  that  are  
internally  consistent,  in  that  county  data  sum  to  state  totals  and  state  data  sum  to  national  
totals.  This  generally  is  not  the  case  with  survey-  based  input-output  models,  which  limits  their  
applicability  to  large-scale  projects  that  affect  a  number  of  interrelated  regions.  (Arguably,  
however,  an  input-output  model  estimated  from  survey  data  has  more  accurate  coefficients,  
because  the  survey  can  be  customized  to  the  problem  at  hand.  In  contrast,  IMPLAN  derives  its  
coefficients  using  a  combination  of  the  national  input-output  survey  model  and  local  activity  
data;  conceivably,  this  will  produce  somewhat  different  results  from  a  direct,  local  survey.  
Given  the  difficulty  and  expense  of  input-output  surveys,  however,  the  disadvantages  of  the  
IMPLAN  approach  are  slight.)

Modeling
The  process  of  modeling  involves  three  steps:  

    · Creation  of  study  area  database;  
    · Customization  of  IMPLAN  coefficients;  
    · Estimating  the  impact  of  an  activity  on  the  model  of  the  study  area  economy.  

The  IMPLAN  model  allows  substitution  and  incorporation  of  primary  data  at  each  stage  of  the  
model-building  process,  greatly  increasing  the  model's  accuracy  and  flexibility.  In  addition  to  
being  able  to  directly  modify  the  IMPLAN  database  statistics,  the  user  can  alter  import  and  
export  relationships,  utilize  modified  input-output  functions,  and  change  industry  groupings.  
IMPLAN  allows  the  creation  of  aggregate  models  consisting  of  industries  grouped  together  for  
a  specific  purpose.  

Once  a  regional  input-output  model  has  been  specified,  impact  analysis  may  be  performed  on  
that  model.  New  industries  or  commodities  can  be  introduced  to  "shock"  the  regional  economy,  
industries  or  commodities  may  be  removed  or  disaggregated,  and  reports  can  be  generated  to  
show  the  consequences  (on  output,  employment,  and  value-added)  of  various  impacts.  

The  key  to  input-output  analysis  is  the  construction  of  the  input-output  or  transactions  table,  
which  shows  the  flow  of  commodities  from  each  of  a  number  of  producing  industries  to  all  
consuming  industries  and  final  demand  (ultimate  consumers).  Given  that  many  industries  
produce  more  than  one  commodity,  production  information  is  often  tabulated  on  an  industry-
by-commodity  basis  into  a  "Make"  matrix,  containing  the  value  of  commodities  produced  by  
different  industries,  and  a  "Use"  matrix,  containing  the  value  of  commodities  used  by  each  
industry  in  the  production  process.  These  matrices  are  combined  to  produce  the  input-output  
transactions  table  showing  each  industry  buying  and  selling  from  other  industries.  

From  these  industry  flows,  two  other  structural  tables  are  developed:  (1)  a  table  of  technical  
coefficients  or  direct  requirements  and  (2)  a  table  of  direct  and  indirect  coefficients  or  total  
requirements.  The  entries  in  the  former  are  interpreted  as  the  dollar  value  of  the  minimal  
requirements  from  each  of  the  contributing  industries  in  order  for  each  producing  industry  to  
produce  one  dollar's  worth  of  output.  The  entries  in  the  latter  table  are  to  be  interpreted  as  the  
amount  of  output  from  the  contributing  industries  required,  both  directly  and  indirectly,  to  
deliver  one  dollar's  worth  of  the  producing  industry's  output  to  final  demand.  


Defining the Study Area
The  IMPLAN  program  uses  an  ordered  series  of  steps  to  build  the  model.  We  describe  them  
here  to  provide  the  interested  reader  with  a  view  of  the  sequence  of  steps  employed,  and  the  
types  of  data  needed  to  model  the  impacts.  




ECONorthwest                         Economic Impacts of Expanding Riverbend Landfill                              A-2
The  first  step  is  the  definition  of  the  study  area  or  study  areas.  Study  area  Databases  are  created  
corresponding  to  these  areas.  These  databases  contain  the  representation  of  the  behavior  of  the  
study  area  economies,  but  do  not  contain  any  information  about  the  specific  project  under  
study.  

Customizing the Social Accounting Matrix
From  the  Study  Area  Databases,  a  mathematical  concept  called  the  Social  Accounting  Matrix  is  
constructed,  using  computer  procedures  incorporated  in  the  IMPLAN  modeling  system.  The  
initial  study  area  data  in  this  transformation  can  be  viewed  and  edited  in  a  spreadsheet-like  
program.  There  are  22  IMPLAN  data  elements  appearing  in  columns  and  528  
industry/commodity  names  forming  the  rows.  The  database  elements  are  organized  into  five  
main  groups:  Final  Demand,  Sales,  Value  Added,  Employment,  and  Total  Industry  Output.  
These  elements  can  be  further  divided  into  those  that  are  specific  to  commodities  and  those  that  
relate  to  industries.  

The  user  may  edit  the  Regional  Purchase  Coefficient  and  the  Directly  Allocated  Exports  
Coefficient  for  each  commodity.  Both  of  these  coefficients  are  calculated  from  the  Social  
Accounting  Matrix  so  they  may  only  be  modified  after  that  matrix  has  been  constructed.  The  
IMPLAN  program  contains  internal  checks,  which  enforce  data  integrity  and  will  not  allow  
values  outside  the  specific,  valid  range  for  these  coefficients  to  be  accepted  by  the  model.  

Building the Input-Output Coefficients
After  creating  the  social  accounting  matrix,  the  input-output  accounts  for  the  model  are  
constructed.  The  input-output  accounts  are  formed  by  transforming  parts  of  the  social  accounts  
from  an  "industry-by-commodity"  format  to  an  "industry-by-industry"  format;  it  combines  
submatrices  into  a  single  "transactions"  submatrix,  as  described  in  general  above.  The  input-
output  accounts  may  be  constructed  with  either  aggregated  or  disaggregated  industry  data.  The  
former  will  reduce  the  size  of  the  industry  matrix  (and  processing  time)  by  creating  aggregate  
industries  from  individual  industries.  

Estimating Multipliers
The  last  step  in  building  the  model  is  to  estimate  the  multipliers.  Five  different  sets  of  
multipliers  are  estimated  by  IMPLAN  corresponding  to  five  measures  of  regional  economic  
activity:  Total  Industry  Output,  Personal  Income,  Total  Income,  Value  Added,  and  
Employment.  Multiplier  analysis  is  used  to  estimate  the  regional  economic  impacts  resulting  
from  a  change  in  final  demand.  Impacts  can  be  in  terms  of  direct  and  indirect  effects  (commonly  
known  as  Type  I  multipliers),  or  in  terms  of  direct,  indirect,  and  induced  effects  (Type  II  and  
Type  III  multipliers).  More  specifically,  direct  effects  are  production  changes  associated  with  the  
immediate  effects  of  final  demand  changes.  Indirect  effects  are  production  changes  in  
backward-linked  industries  caused  by  the  changing  input  needs  of  directly  affected  industries.  
Induced  effects  are  the  changes  in  regional  household  spending  patterns  caused  by  changes  in  
household  income--  generated  from  the  direct  and  indirect  effects.  



ECONorthwest                         Economic Impacts of Expanding Riverbend Landfill                             A-3
IMPLAN  calculates  two  types  of  multipliers  for  each  of  the  five  impact  measures.  The  first  
output  multiplier  represents  the  value  of  production,  from  indirect  and  direct  effects,  required  
from  all  sectors  by  a  particular  sector  in  order  to  deliver  one  dollar's  worth  of  output.  The  
second  output  multiplier  adds  in  the  induced  requirements.  The  size  of  the  multiplier  is  not  a  
measure  of  the  amount  of  activity  or  the  importance  of  a  given  industry  for  the  economy.  It  is  
an  estimation  of  what  would  happen  if  that  industry's  sales  to  final  demand  increased  or  
decreased.  In  other  words,  output  multipliers  can  be  used  to  gauge  the  interdependence  of  
sectors;  the  larger  the  output  multiplier,  the  greater  the  interdependence  of  the  sector  on  the  rest  
of  the  regional  economy.  


Performing Impact Analysis
Once  the  model  is  complete,  impact  analysis  can  be  performed  on  the  model.  Impact  analysis  
involves  posing  a  change  in  the  demand  for  commodities  and  using  the  multiplier  model  to  
examine  the  effects  that  producing  and  delivering  the  commodities  may  have  on  a  region's  
employment,  income,  and  population.  Several  types  of  economic  impact  analyses  can  be  carried  
out  simply  by  varying  structural,  technological,  and/or  trade  factors  within  the  model.  For  
instance,  the  user  may  add  or  remove  sectors  from  the  model,  or  change  the  size  of  an  industry,  
or  the  user  may  change  production  functions,  or  make  changes  in  commodity  imports  and  
exports.  To  perform  a  full  economic  impact  analysis  with  IMPLAN,  all  of  the  relevant  
structural,  technological,  and  trade  related  adjustments  must  already  be  incorporated  in  the  
regional  model.  

In  order  to  keep  track  of  and  organize  all  of  the  information  needed  to  describe  a  change  in  the  
final  demand  for  commodities,  IMPLAN  uses  the  general  concept  of  a  "scenario"  to  capture  all  
of  the  information  about  the  change(s)  in  commodity  demand  for  which  impacts  are  being  
estimated.  Scenarios  are  made  up  of  several  building  blocks.  

At  the  lowest  level  is  a  transaction;  this  is  the  actual  expenditure  that  represents  the  final  
demand  for  a  commodity.  Descriptive  information  about  this  transaction,  such  as  what  
commodity  is  involved,  when  it  occurred,  and  how  it  was  measured,  are  collectively  referred  to  
as  an  event.  A  collection  of  events,  which  have  descriptive  information  in  common,  occurring  
together,  are  referred  to  as  an  activity.  For  instance,  the  group  of  events  that  make  up  an  activity  
may  be  related  to  each  other  by  who  caused  them  to  take  place  or  why  they  took  place.  

A  scenario  is  a  collection  of  one  or  more  activities  (which  includes,  in  turn,  events  with  
transactions),  specifying  where  the  activity(s)  occurred  and  at  what  level(s).  A  scenario  may  be  
viewed  as  equivalent  to  a  management,  planning,  or  policy  alternative.  Units  of  measure  are  
assigned  to  each  activity  and  can  be  in  physical  terms,  monetary  terms,  household  
consumption,  or  any  other  terms  appropriate  for  the  problem  under  study.  The  unit  price  
represents  the  transaction  rate--the  total  amount  of  purchases  necessary  to  participate  in  one  
unit  of  an  activity.

In  order  to  run  an  economic  impact  analysis,  the  user  must  build  a  datafile  of  changes  in  final  
demand.  All  activities  to  be  included  in  the  analysis  must  be  defined,  providing  information  
about  who  initiated  the  demand  change,  the  base  year  of  the  activity,  the  transaction  basis  
(commodity  purchase  or  an  industry's  output),  conversion  rate  (which  gives  a  scale  of  the  
transactions  occurring  in  the  activity),  and  measurement  units.  There  is  a  finite  list  of  causal  
agents  to  choose  from  when  describing  the  activity,  comprised  of  the  following  choices:  
households,  federal  government,  state/local  government,  enterprises  (investment),  and  
industry.  Once  the  activity  is  defined,  the  next  step  is  to  define  events  that  occur  in  the  activity,  
in  much  the  same  way  as  for  the  activity  itself.  


Model Outputs
The  IMPLAN  model  provides  estimates  of  impacts  of  the  expenditures  on  income,  and  
employment  that  follow  from  direct,  indirect,  and  induced  expenditures.  By  writing  special  
fiscal  impact  modules,  the  model  also  can  be  used  to  estimate  impacts  on  the  tax  revenue  
collected  through  property  taxes,  sales  taxes,  corporate  income  taxes,  and  other  fiscal  devices.  In  
addition,  IMPLAN  can  provide  estimates  of  stimulus  to  population  growth  that  will  result  from  
project  expenditures.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


1. The property adjacent to the Riverbend Landfill, located at 13469 Oregon 18 in McMinnville,
   Oregon, has been proposed for a change in zoning from Public Works/Safety and Recreational
   Commercial to Exclusive Farm Use. Following the zone change, Riverbend Landfill is propos-
   ing a lateral expansion to the landfill as well as the construction of a green technology facility.

2. Due to the location of the subject property and the limited amount of permitted uses within the
   Exclusive Farm Use zoning, it is not expected that the property be developed with a more inten-
   sive use than what is currently being proposed.

3. The intersection of Oregon Highway 18 at the site access is projected to function well within the
   Oregon Department of Transportation's performance standards throughout the planning horizon
   regardless of the additional trips that result from the proposed zone change and subsequent lat-
   eral expansion and development of the green technology facility. Accordingly, no mitigation is
   recommended.

4. The proposed development under the new zoning will not significantly affect existing or planned
   transportation facilities as defined under Oregon's Transportation Planning Rule (TPR). Accord-
   ingly, no mitigation is recommended and the TPR is satisfied.

5. A detailed observation into the crashes occurring at the study intersection shows no excessive
   crash rates or trends that are indicative of issues that need to be addressed. The site access to
   Highway 18 already has left and right-turn lanes in place and no safety mitigations are recom-
   mended.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION


INTRODUCTION

This traffic study analyzes and addresses the potential traffic impacts of a proposed zone change and
lateral expansion of the Riverbend Landfill in Yamhill County, Oregon.

The Riverbend Landfill, located at 13469 Oregon 18 in McMinnville, Oregon, is proposing a lateral
expansion to the west as well as the construction of a new green technology facility. To receive ap-
proval for this expansion, a zone change from Public Works/Safety and Recreational Commercial to
Exclusive Farm Use is required. Detailed information on traffic counts, trip generation calculations,
and intersection capacity calculations are included in the technical appendix of this report.


LOCATION DESCRIPTION

The Riverbend Landfill is located approximately two miles southwest of McMinnville, Oregon. The
property is bounded by Oregon Highway 18 to the northwest, agricultural land to the north, and the
Yamhill River to the east and south.

The landfill operation only has one access to Oregon Highway 18 located at milepost 41.56. There
are two other accesses that currently serve other existing uses on the site. The first is a small drive-
way that serves a single-family home. The second is a driveway near the southern boundary of the
site that serves the Mulkey RV Park. None of the activities associated with the operation of the land-
fill will add traffic to these two additional accesses.

Due to the largely rural location of the site, no major street intersections are present near the subject
property that would require analysis of site impacts. Projected traffic impacts during the weekday
morning and evening peak hours as well as the Saturday peak were analyzed for the intersection of
the landfill access and Oregon Highway 18.

Oregon Highway 18, also designated as Salmon River Highway, is under the jurisdiction of the Ore-
gon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and is classified as a Statewide Highway Route. The
highway is on the National Highway System and is designated as a State Freight Route, a Truck
Route, as well as an Expressway. It is generally a two-lane roadway with a statutory rural highway
speed limit of 55 mph. The facility has wide paved shoulders in the vicinity of the subject property.

The intersection of Oregon Highway 18 at the site access is a three-legged intersection controlled by
a STOP sign on the access approach. The southwest bound approach has a through lane and a dedi-
cated left-turn lane, whereas the northbound approach has a through lane and a dedicated right-turn
lane. The site access has a shared lane for all turning movements, but is wide enough to accommo-
date a right and left-turning vehicle simultaneously.

A vicinity map showing the project site, the study area intersection, and the traffic control device is
shown in Figure 1 on page six.

TRAFFIC COUNTS

Traffic counts were conducted at the intersection of Oregon Highway 18 and the property access on
Thursday, July 11th, 2013, from 5:00 AM to 5:00 PM and on Saturday, July 13th, 2013, from 6:00
AM to 4:00 PM. The times observed corresponded with the operating hours of the Riverbend Land-
fill. Using these counts, the morning peak hour was found to occur from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM and
the evening peak hour was found to occur from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Design volumes for ODOT facilities are based on the 30th highest hour conditions, which typically
occur during the summer months. Following the procedure given by ODOT's Analysis Procedures
Manual, a seasonal adjustment factor was calculated to apply to the counts. ODOT has an Automat-
ic Traffic Recorder (ATR) located at milepost 41.0 along Oregon Highway 18. Using data from this
recorder, a seasonal adjustment factor of 1.00 was derived for the weekday traffic count while a sea-
sonal adjustment factor of 1.015 was derived for the Saturday traffic count.

Figure 2 on page seven shows the seasonally adjusted traffic volumes at the study area intersection.

TRIP GENERATION & DISTRIBUTION


TRIP GENERATION

The proposed zone change from Public Works/Safety and Recreational Commercial to Exclusive
Farm Use affects the 57.5 acre property between the existing location of the Riverbend Landfill and
Oregon Highway 18. The property will accommodate the lateral expansion of the landfill directly
west of the current location as well as a green technology facility to the southwest.

To observe the effects of the zone change, a reasonable worst-case assumption is made for what de-
velopment could occupy the property. Due to the location of the subject property and the limited
amount of permitted uses within an Exclusive Farm Use district, it is not expected that the property
be developed with a more intensive use than what is currently proposed.

The traffic impacts of the landfill and new green technology facility were observed throughout the
planning horizon. It should be noted that Waste Management is planning for a flat disposal rate
throughout the life of the landfill and is not expecting any increase in traffic to the site. Additional
trips beyond this disposal rate would be diverted to other sites. However, to maintain a conservative
analysis, annual increases in traffic corresponding with population growth were accounted for in the
trip generation calculations.

To account for the increase in traffic using the landfill over the planning horizon, a growth factor
was applied to the number of current vehicles using the facility. Since the landfill's trip generation is
based on population and the resulting waste stream to the landfill, the growth factor was derived us-
ing forecasted traffic volumes along Oregon Highway 18 in front of the site. Due to the landfill only
having one access and being the only destination reachable through that access, the growth rate was
applied to the traffic counts for vehicles entering and exiting the landfill.

To account for the new green technology facility, information regarding the expected operation of
the facility was used to derive a trip generation. The green technology facility will divert a portion
of the waste stream and convert that waste into a solid product that can be combusted and used as an
alternative energy source. The new facility will be operated by approximately 35 employees split
into two shifts per day, seven days a week. The facility will also utilize trucks delivering waste to
the landfill to back-haul and transport products from the new facility to the next destination. To
maintain a conservative, worst-case analysis, it is assumed that the green technology facility would
change shifts during each of the peak hours and that 100 percent of the product produced would be
shipped out as new truck loads, with no back-hauling by existing trucks.

As discussed in this report, the existing Mulkey RV Park will be closing. Removal of these trips
from Highway 18 will result in a net increase in trips that is slightly lower than what is reported here.
A summary of the trip generation calculations for each of the landfill facilities is shown in the tables
on the following page. Detailed trip generation calculations are included in the appendix to this re-
port.

TRIP DISTRIBUTION

The trips generated by the Riverbend Landfill expansion were assumed to be distributed proportion-
ately to the traffic currently entering and exiting the facility. This resulted in approximately a 90-
percent distribution of traffic originating and terminating from the northeast of the subject property.
Traffic for the green technology facility was assumed to follow a similar distribution with the majori-
ty arriving and departing northeast along Oregon Highway 18.

The trip assignment for the projected lateral expansion and construction of the green technology fa-
cility is shown in Figure 3 on page 10.

OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS


BACKGROUND TRAFFIC

To provide analysis of the impact of the proposed zone change on the nearby transportation facilities,
an estimation of future traffic volumes is required. In order to calculate the future traffic volumes, a
growth rate must be applied to existing traffic volumes.

Historical annual average daily traffic (ADT) on Oregon Highway 18 at milepost 41.0 peaked in
2006 with about 14,300 ADT but has decreased over the next years to about 13,100 ADT in 2011.
The highway experience a seasonal fluctuation in traffic flow since it is a primary route to the Ore-
gon coast. The peak traffic month is August with traffic volumes 18% higher than the average of all
months.

Future traffic volumes were projected in conformance with the requirements established in ODOT's
Analysis Procedures Manual. Based on data from ODOT's Future Volumes Table, a growth rate of
1.7 percent per year was derived for Oregon Highway 18 at the location of the ATR. This growth
rate was applied to the traffic on Oregon Highway 18 over the 17-year period to observe traffic at the
2030 planning horizon. Figure 4 on page 12 shows the projected year 2030 traffic volumes. Figure
5 on page 13 shows the projected year 2030 traffic volumes plus traffic generated by the landfill's
lateral expansion and the construction of the green technology facility.

CAPACITY ANALYSIS

To determine the level of service at the study intersection, a capacity analysis was conducted. Since
Oregon Highway 18 is under ODOT jurisdiction, their performance standards based on a volume-to-
capacity (v/c) ratio were used for evaluation. The v/c ratio is a measure that compares the traffic
volume (demand) against the available capacity of an intersection. According to the Oregon High-
way Plan Mobility Standard Guidelines, a v/c ratio of 0.70 or less is required for intersections out-
side of an Urban Growth Boundary in rural areas.

The study area intersection was analyzed using the unsignalized intersection analysis method in the
HIGHWAY CAPACITY MANUAL, published by the Transportation Research Board. The analysis
was made for the morning, evening, and Saturday peak hours for existing conditions, year 2030
background conditions, and year 2030 background plus site trips from the proposed development.

Currently, the intersection of Oregon Highway 18 at the site access operates at a v/c ratio of 0.04
during the morning peak hour and a v/c ratio of 0.07 during the evening peak hour. During the Sat-
urday mid-day peak period, the intersection presently operates at a v/c ratio of 0.09. Under year
2030 conditions, the intersection is projected to operate at a v/c ratio of 0.05 during the morning peak
hour, 0.09 during the evening peak hour, and 0.13 during the Saturday peak hour. With the lateral
expansion of the Riverbend Landfill and the construction of the green technology building, the inter-
section is projected to operate at a v/c ratio of 0.12 during the morning peak hour, 0.19 during the
evening peak hour, and 0.25 during the Saturday peak hour. It should be noted that it was assumed
all product being shipped from the green technology building would do so on trucks that arrive and
depart solely for that purpose, when in reality the facility is expected to ship product on trucks that
have already delivered waste to the landfill.

The intersection of Oregon Highway 18 at the site access operates well within ODOT's performance
standards throughout the planning horizon. Accordingly, no mitigation is recommended.

The results of the capacity analysis, along with the levels of service, delay, and v/c ratios are shown
in the following two tables. Detailed calculations, as well as tables showing the relationships be-
tween delay and level of service are included in the appendix to this report.

ROADWAY AND ROUTE IMPACTS

Traffic utilizing the Riverbend Landfill site is pulled from a greater area than just the nearby city of
McMinnville or even Yamhill County. Truck traffic transports waste regularly from a Forest Grove
transfer site to the Riverbend Landfill by way of Oregon Highway 47. Generally, between 17 and 20
trucks make this round trip per day. This traffic is spread out between the hours of 5:00 AM to 4:00
PM and is not projected to increase with the lateral expansion of the landfill or the construction of
the green technology facility.

With the expansion of the Riverbend Landfill facility, the nearby Mulkey RV Park will be closed and
the area will be used for operations pertaining to the landfill. The approximately 65-unit recreational
vehicle park operates between 40% and 90% of capacity through the typical year. The park will be
closed as part of activity on the site following the subject zone change. Based on the occupancy of
the park, it currently generates between 5 and 12 AM peak hour trips and between 7 and 16 PM peak
hour trips. These trips will be removed from Highway 18 upon closure of the park. Supporting trip
generation calculations are included in the appendix to this report.


TRANSPORTATION PLANNING RULE

Oregon's Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) is in place to ensure that the transportation system is
capable of supporting possible increases in traffic intensity that could result from changes to adopted
plans and land use regulations. The applicable elements of the TPR are each quoted directly in ital-
ics below, with a response directly following.

660-012-0060

(1) If an amendment to a functional plan, an acknowledged comprehensive plan, or a land use regu-
    lation (including a zoning map) would significantly affect an existing or planned transportation
    facility, then the local government must put in place measures as provided in section (2) of this
    rule, unless the amendment is allowed under section (3), (9) or (10) of this rule. A plan or land
    use regulation amendment significantly affects a transportation facility if it would:



Riverbend Landfill Zone Change ­ Yamhill County, Oregon                                               15
    (a) Change the functional classification of an existing or planned transportation facility (exclu-
        sive of correction of map errors in an adopted plan);

    (b) Change standards implementing a functional classification system; or

    (c) Result in any of the effects listed in paragraphs (A) through (C) of this subsection based on
        projected conditions measured at the end of the planning period identified in the adopted
        TSP. As part of evaluating projected conditions, the amount of traffic projected to be gener-
        ated within the area of the amendment may be reduced if the amendment includes an en-
        forceable, ongoing requirement that would demonstrably limit traffic generation, including,
        but not limited to, transportation demand management. This reduction may diminish or
        completely eliminate the significant effect of the amendment.

         (A) Types or levels of travel or access that are inconsistent with the functional classifica-
             tion of an existing or planned transportation facility;

         (B) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility such that it
             would not meet the performance standards identified in the TSP or comprehensive
             plan; or

         (C) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility that is oth-
             erwise projected to not meet the performance standards identified in the TSP or com-
             prehensive plan.

In the case of this report, subsections (A) and (B) are not triggered, since the proposed zone change
will not impact or alter the functional classification of any existing or planned facility and the pro-
posal does not include a change to any functional classification standards.

Subsection (C) is also not triggered since the intersection of Oregon Highway 18 at the site access
will meet performance standards throughout the planning horizon. The study intersection has suffi-
cient capacity to serve more traffic than is generated under the reasonable worst-case scenario.

Based on the detailed analysis, the proposed zone change will not degrade the performance of any
existing or planned transportation facility. Accordingly, the Transportation Planning Rule is satis-
fied.


TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM PLAN

Yamhill County's 1994 Transportation System Plan (TSP) provides goals, policies, and procedures
for the development and improvement of transportation facilities as well as list future planned trans-
portation projects. The TSP makes no specific mention of the Riverbend Landfill or planned trans-
portation improvements that would affect the traffic near the subject property. The change in zoning
followed by the expansion of the landfill and construction of a green technology facility is not pro-
jected to significantly impact the nearby transportation system's efficiency or safety. Accordingly,
the proposed zone change and development is in conformance with Yamhill's TSP.

SAFETY ANALYSIS


CRASH DATA ANALYSIS

Using data obtained from ODOT's Crash Data System, a review was performed for the most recent
available five years of crash data (2008 ­ 2012) for Oregon Highway 18 between milepost 41.00 and
42.00. A crash rate was calculated under the common assumption that traffic counted during the PM
peak period represents 10% of the average daily traffic (ADT) at the intersection. Crash rates greater
than 1.0 crashes per million entering vehicles (CMEV) are generally indicative of a need for further
investigation and possible mitigation.

The one-mile segment of road along Oregon Highway 18 that contains the site access had a total of
eight reported crashes during the analysis period. Of these crashes, only one appeared to be related
to the intersection in which a vehicle followed too closely and failed to decrease their speed before
rear-ending a slowed vehicle. The crash resulted in a possible injury or complaint of pain (Injury-C).

Even if all eight crashes are considered, the crash rate would be calculated at 0.37 CMEV, which is
not typically indicative of significant crash patterns or design concerns. Accordingly, no safety miti-
gations are recommended.

CONCLUSIONS
The traffic resulting from the proposed zone change to the property adjacent to the Riverbend Land-
fill, located at 13469 Oregon 18 in McMinnville, Oregon, from Public Works/Safety and Recreation-
al Commercial to Exclusive Farm Use will not cause any significant impact to the transportation
network in the surrounding area.

The expected development of the properties under the proposed zoning will not significantly affect
existing or planned transportation facilities as defined under Oregon's Transportation Planning Rule.
Accordingly, no mitigation is recommended.

The operational analysis of the intersection of Oregon Highway 18 at the site access shows adequate
capacity throughout the planning horizon, regardless of the additional traffic resulting from the zone
change and subsequent expansion of the landfill as well as the construction of the green technology
facility. No operational mitigations are recommended.

A detailed observation of the crash history at the study intersection shows no trends that are indica-
tive of safety issues that need to be addressed. No safety mitigations are recommended.

Based on the detailed analysis, no mitigations are required or recommended for the zone change
from Public Works/Safety and Recreational Commercial to Exclusive Farm Use or the landfill ex-
pansion and construction of a green technology facility.

                                  LEVEL OF SERVICE


        Level of service is used to describe the quality of traffic flow. Levels of service A
to C are considered good, and rural roads are usually designed for level of service C.
Urban streets and signalized intersections are typically designed for level of service D.
Level of service E is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. For unsignalized
intersections, level of service E is generally considered acceptable. Here is a more
complete description of levels of service:

        Level of service A: Very low delay at intersections, with all traffic signal cycles
clearing and no vehicles waiting through more than one signal cycle. On highways, low
volume and high speeds, with speeds not restricted by other vehicles.

        Level of service B: Operating speeds beginning to be affected by other traffic;
short traffic delays at intersections. Higher average intersection delay than for level of
service A resulting from more vehicles stopping.

        Level of service C: Operating speeds and maneuverability closely controlled by
other traffic; higher delays at intersections than for level of service B due to a significant
number of vehicles stopping. Not all signal cycles clear the waiting vehicles. This is the
recommended design standard for rural highways.

        Level of service D: Tolerable operating speeds; long traffic delays occur at in-
tersections. The influence of congestion is noticeable. At traffic signals many vehicles
stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. The number of signal cycle
failures, for which vehicles must wait through more than one signal cycle, are noticeable.
This is typically the design level for urban signalized intersections.

        Level of service E: Restricted speeds, very long traffic delays at traffic signals, and
traffic volumes near capacity. Flow is unstable so that any interruption, no matter how
minor, will cause queues to form and service to deteriorate to level of service F. Traffic
signal cycle failures are frequent occurrences. For unsignalized intersections, level of
service E or better is generally considered acceptable.

        Level of service F: Extreme delays, resulting in long queues which may interfere
with other traffic movements. There may be stoppages of long duration, and speeds may
drop to zero. There may be frequent signal cycle failures. Level of service F will typically
result when vehicle arrival rates are greater than capacity. It is considered unacceptable by
most drivers.

                       PROPOSED GOAL 5 ORDINANCE LANGUAGE

                            TO PROTECT RIPARIAN CORRIDORS

        As part of its Plan Amendment and Zone Change application, Riverbend Landfill Co.,
Inc. ("RLC") has identified riparian corridors that may require protection under Statewide
Planning Goal 5. In order to protect the riparian area within those riparian corridors, RLC
proposes that the County adopt the following language as part of the ordinance approving the
Plan Amendment and Zone Change.

1 ­For purposes of this ordinance, the "Zone Change Area" consists of Tax Lots 101, 200, 400
and 401 on Tax Map 5501. "Riparian Area" shall mean the riparian corridor established through
the safe harbor method currently set forth in OAR 660-023-0090(1)(b), except that the setback
along all streams shall be 100 feet.

2 ­ Within the Zone Change Area, no permanent alteration of the Riparian Area shall be allowed
by grading or by the placement of structures or impervious surfaces, except for the following
uses, provided they are designed and constructed to minimize intrusion into the Riparian Area:

       (A) Streets, roads, and paths;

       (B) Drainage facilities, utilities, and irrigation pumps;

       (C) Water-related and water-dependent uses; and

        (D) Replacement of existing structures with structures in the same location that do not
disturb additional riparian surface area.

3 ­ Within the Zone Change Area, the removal of riparian vegetation within the Riparian Area is
limited to the following activities:

       (A) Removal of non-native vegetation when replaced with native plant species; and

      (B) Removal of vegetation necessary for the development of water-related or water-
dependent uses;

4 ­ A property owner may seek reduction or removal of the restrictions in sections 2 and 3 upon
demonstration of a hardship or map error, or upon a showing that a lot or parcel has been
rendered not buildable by application of those restrictions.

       (A) An application for reduction or removal of the restrictions in sections 2 and 3 shall be
           made to the County following the Type B process set forth in YCZO Section 1301.
       (B) An application for reduction or removal of the restrictions in sections 2 and 3 shall
           be subject to the approval standards in YCZO Section 1200.
5 ­ Notwithstanding the provisions in sections 2 through 4, permanent alteration of the Riparian
Area within the Zone Change Area by placement of structures or impervious surfaces shall be
allowed upon a demonstration that equal or better protection for identified resources will be
ensured through restoration of Riparian Areas, enhanced buffer treatment, or similar measures.
In no case shall such alterations occupy more than 50 percent of the width of the Riparian Area
measured from the upland edge of the area.

Introduction
Riverbend Landfill Company, Inc. (RLI), a subsidiary of Waste Management, Inc. (WM), 
operates the Riverbend Landfill, a municipal waste landfill on an approximately 620acre 
site in McMinnville, Yamhill County, Oregon (Figure 1). The Landfill serves Yamhill 
County and the surrounding area and is permitted by the Oregon Department of 
Environmental Quality (DEQ) to accept municipal solid waste and nonhazardous special 
waste that requires special handling. In 2005, WM received Corporate Wildlife Habitat 
Certification for its environmental stewardship and wildlife habitat management 
programs at the Riverbend Landfill site; in 2007 and 2009 that certification was 
renewed. This document contains a description of the lands Riverbend's owns and the 
habitat management prescriptions that WM currently implements and may implement 
in the coming years to improve and maintain wildlife habitat quality within the 
Riverbend Landfill property. 

SiteDescription
Riverbend Landfill is located within a predominantly agricultural portion of Yamhill 
County, just southwest of McMinnville, Oregon off State Highway 18 (Hwy 18)(Figures 1 
and 2). It is primarily surrounded by agricultural lands including, row crops, orchards, 
pastures, and some associated rural residences. Riparian forest areas associated with 
the South Yamhill River and two small tributaries are present to the south and east of 
the site. A closed landfill owned by Yamhill County (Whiteson Landfill) is located to the 
south across the river. 

The landfill site includes approximately 130 acres of operational facilities. The landfill 
footprint, located in the northeast portion of the site, includes approximately 86 acres 
of both active and closed waste disposal cells. Additional ancillary facilities located in 
close proximity of the landfill include the landfill office, scale house, maintenance area, 
leachate storage pond, three poplar tree leachate management areas, a stormwater 
management pond, and various storage buildings. In 2009, a stateoftheart, four 
megawatt landfill gastoenergy plant was built adjacent to the landfill to convert landfill 
gas to electricity. A small recreational vehicle park also exists southwest of the landfill, 
as well as a relict walnut plantation (Walnut Orchard #1; Figure 2). 

To the north of Hwy 18, RLI owns approximately 145 acres of "buffer lands" that 
continue to be leased for agricultural uses, including production of grass seed and straw, 
walnuts and hazelnut (orchards), and nursery stock, along with associated residences. A 
small unnamed creek traverses the row crop area in a southeastern direction where it 
crosses under Hwy 18 and runs south of the landfill.  

The remaining RLI ownership that lies generally south and east of the landfill consists of 
lands managed for wildlife habitat. The area is dominated by the dynamic floodplain of 
the South Yamhill River and contains several large, noncultivated open fields, upland 
forests, and riparian forests (Figure 2). Approximately 54.7 acres of the noncultivated 

                                                                                            1

open fields located within the South Yamhill River floodplain are proposed for extensive 
riparian restoration and is being developed now and over the next 10 years. 

GoalsandObjectives
The goal of the wildlife management plan is to increase the value of nonoperational 
lands at the Riverbend Landfill site to support native wildlife. The following objectives 
were identified for the Riverbend Landfill property: 

         Determine which wildlife species are associated with wildlife habitat types 
         present at the landfill site. 

         Characterize the array of ecological functions of species associated with existing, 
         altered, restored, or degraded environments. 

         Analyze the specific sets of ecological functions, including their diversity and 
         redundancies among species in terms of their potential influence on ecosystem 
         diversity, productivity, and sustainability and threatened or endangered 
         functions. 

         Develop a set of management prescriptions that can be used to address both 
         shortterm and longterm habitat management to enhance fish and wildlife 
         habitat and overall ecosystem function.  

WildlifeandHabitatTypes
In 2007, Riverbend Landfill teamed with wildlife biologists to assess wildlife and wildlife 
functions in the study area. These functions were assessed for baseline and future 
conditions using Wildlife Habitat Relationships developed by Johnson and O'Neil for 
Washington and Oregon (Johnson and O'Neil 2001). Wildlife habitat relationships 
outlined in the Johnson and O'Neil database assume that wildlife occurrence and 
viability in a particular area are related to the type, amount, and value of various wildlife 
habitats. Tom O'Neil, Director of the Northwest Habitat Institute, refers to the Johnson 
and O'Neil (2001) wildlife habitat relationship database as the Interactive Biodiversity 
Information System (IBIS) database. IBIS is continually updated.  

The IBIS database includes a list of the biological functions or Key Ecological Functions 
(KEF) that each wildlife species performs in each of the habitat types present in the 
study area. Example functions include burrowing, creating cavities, dispersing seeds, 
and predation. The total list of Key Ecological Functions includes 104 categories. 
Knowing what functions a species performs allows us to determine a relative index of 
functional redundancy by each habitat type present in the study area. The Functional 
Redundancy Index (FRI) is determined by counting the number of species that perform 
each function for each habitat type that occurs within the Study area. If many species 
perform a function, then redundancy is high; if few or only one species performs a 
function, then redundancy is low. The number of species performing each function is 

                                                                                             2 
Riverbend Landfill                                                   Wildlife Management Plan 
 

summed and divided by the total number of functions that occur in each habitat type. 
This results in a mean functional redundancy index for each habitat type. For example, 
Westside Riparian ­ Wetlands has a mean functional redundancy of 20.07 which implies 
on average within this habitat about 20 species are performing each function. Lastly, to 
achieve some insight into the overall habitat quality, the Functional Index is multiplied 
by the amount of habitat that occurs within each habitat type in the study area to arrive 
at a comparable number of habitat units ("HUs"), or "FRIHUs." Thus, once an FRI for a 
particular habitat type is established, one may easily model the effects of possible land 
use practices (e.g., farming, forestry, development, open space, etc) or other changes by 
adjusting the relative acres of habitats within the study area. 

Wildlife habitat in the Riverbend Landfill was mapped based on Johnson and O'Neil 
(2001) habitat types using a Geographic Information System (GIS) developed from 
groundtruthed aerial photography. The GIS was used to determine the number of acres 
of each habitat class. Each habitat type is briefly described below. Functional profiles 
were developed for current conditions to serve as the baseline data to evaluate future 
land use changes at the site (i.e. habitat, restoration projects, implementation of habitat 
management prescriptions, etc.).  


WildlifeHabitatTypes

Wildlife
A list of species potentially occurring within habitats found at the Riverbend Landfill Site 
was developed using the IBIS database (Appendix A). The habitats at the Riverbend 
Landfill could potentially support 156 birds, 71 mammals, 18 amphibians, and 17 
reptiles. The list also shows which species are routinely encountered, at least on an 
annual basis, e.g., migrant bird species. 

HabitatTypesoftheRiverbendLandfill
Johnson and O'Neil (2001) identify 32 wildlife habitat types in Oregon and Washington 
that are based upon the similarity in use by wildlife of vegetation cover types. Review of 
recent aerial photographs and site reconnaissance identified nine of these wildlife types 
are on the property (Table 1). Figure 3 depicts the distribution of wildlife habitat types 
at the Riverbend Landfill property, which are described below.

UrbanandMixedEnvirons
Urban and Mixed Environs consist of areas that have been drastically altered through 
development, where historic habitat elements have been replaced by buildings, 
impermeable surfaces, and planting of nonnative species. There are currently 140 acres 
of Urban and Mixed Environs within the Riverbend Landfill property (Table 1). This 
habitat type consists of the actual landfill, leachate storage pond, buildings and 
associated parking lots, as well as the RV Park and several residences (Figure 2). Total 
crown cover and tree density within this habitat type is virtually nonexistent. 
Understory vegetation may be completely absent, or if present, is diminutive and single
layered. Many structural features typical of the historical vegetation, such as snags, 
dead and downed wood, and brush piles, are often completely removed from the 
landscape.  

It is important to note that this habitat type designation likely somewhat undervalues 
the habitat associated with the landfill site because much of the site, even where 
developed, generally has more relative habitat value due to the reasonable vegetation 
that often exists (akin to reasonable grasslands), and is further heightened by the rural 
setting. 

WestsideLowlandConiferHardwoodForest
Westside lowland coniferhardwood forest occupies about 3.2% of the Riverbend 
Landfill property (Table 1). At the site, this habitat predominantly consists of linear 

                                                                                                   4

buffers adjacent to HWY 18, the poplar tree plantations and some of the edge habitat 
near some landfill buildings (Figure 2). This habitat is a mix of coniferous and deciduous 
trees. Common native species include western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), Douglas
fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), grand fir (Abies grandis), Oregon white oak (Quercus 
garryana), red alder (Alnus rubra), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), vine maple (Acer 
circinatum), hazelnut (Corylus cornuta) and sword fern (Polystichum munitum).   

Agriculture,PastureandMixedEnvirons
Agricultural habitat, comprising 58% of the site, is the predominant wildlife habitat type 
within the study area (Table 1). The agricultural habitat occurs within a matrix of other 
habitat types including Westside RiparianWetlands and Westside Lowlands Conifer
Deciduous Forest. Agricultural habitat has a wide array of structural complexity because 
it includes several cover types ranging from lowstature annual grasses and row crops 
(<3.3 ft [1 m]) to mature orchards (>66 ft [20 m]). However, within any cover type, 
structural diversity is typically low because usually only one to a few species of similar 
height are cultivated. Depending on management intensity or cultivation method, 
agricultural habitat may vary substantially in structure annually; cultivated cropland and 
modified grasslands are typified by periods of bare soil and harvest whereas pastures 
are mowed, hayed, or grazed one or more times during the growing season. 

Agricultural habitats within the Riverbend Landfill property have been subdivided into 
Row Crops, Improved Pasture, Unimproved Pasture and Nursery/Orchard/Vineyard 
(Table 1). Approximately 137.3 acres of Row Crops occur along the western portion of 
the site. These consist of grass seed and straw fields of annual ryegrass (Lolium perenne) 
and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea). A couple of small wetlands are present in the 
southern habitat block, which lie within relict oxbows of the South Yamhill River. These 
areas are too wet to cultivate and tend to consist of mud flats, sometime with reed 
canarygrass and prostrate knotweed (Polygonum aviculare). There are two relatively 
small areas (4.1 acres) of mowed mixed grasses near the RV Park that have been 
classified as Improved Pasture. The large area of inactive abandoned fields (83.5 acres) 
at the east and southeast portion of the site have been delineated as Unimproved 
Pastures. The southern lobe of this habitat area includes grassy wetlands (24.8 acres) 
that are seasonally inundated by the South Yamhill River. Both the upland and wetland 
portions of the Unimproved Pasture habitat tend to be dominated by reed canarygrass 
and meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis).  

The remainder of the agricultural habitat on the site was classified as 
Nursery/Orchard/Vineyard (136.1 acres). This habitat type includes the fruit and 
hazelnut orchards north of HWY 18, the poplar plantations, and two walnut orchards. 
The poplar plantations are part of RLI's leachate management system. Leachate is 
stored in the 20million gallon leachate storage pond throughout the year. During the 
summer months, leachate is used to drip irrigate the Poplar Plantations. RLI has used

The Walnut Orchards are relict orchards that had been left as wildlife habitat and buffer 
areas. They total approximately 20 acres in size, and both have some associated riparian 
forest at the edges, particularly the southern orchard, which is almost completely 
encompassed Westside RiparianWetlands habitat associated with the South Yamhill 
River (Figure 2). Both consist of relatively evenaged stands but the southern one is 
significantly older (estimated greater than 50years) and has a relatively well developed 
structure and understory, which is dominated by salmonberry, cow parsnip (Heracleum 
lanatum) stinging nettle (Urtica dioica), and a variety of other native herbs and shrubs; 
some scattered Himalayan blackberry is also present. Still, the overall species and 
structural diversity within the older orchard is somewhat low compared to more native 
forests. Snags and downed wood are not common this area, which is are important 
habitat components. 

WestsideGrasslands
Westside grasslands occupy approximately 3.7% of the study area (Table 1) and occur in 
one habitat block located at the southern portion of the site (Figure 2). The topography 
in this area varies from flat to gently rolling. This habitat is surrounded by Westside 
Riparian ­ Wetlands habitat. Nonnative species dominate the upland grassland, 
including tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), Queen 
Anne's lace (Daucus carota), and bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare). However, the wetlands 
tend the be dominated by natives. 

Lakes,Rivers,Ponds,Reservoirs
Approximately 1.4% of the study area is composed of open water habitat (Table 1), 
consisting of the South Yamhill River (Figure 2). The area of the river is based on the 
wetted perimeter captured in the aerial photo. The South Yamhill River is associated 
with Westside RiparianWetlands and Herbaceous Wetland habitat types. Historically, 
the open water habitat would have been more extensive at this site. There are remnant 
scars of old oxbows and former river channel locations evident from the aerial photos. 
Beaver, which were historically present in much larger numbers, likely created large 
ponds within the floodplain. Upstream Army Corps projects and a long period of farming 
have led to the degradation of the river channel, mainly due to channelization 
structures and practices that lead to a more "flashy" river hydrograph, which lead to 
river downcutting.  

WestsideRiparianWetlands
Approximately 11.3% of the Riverbend Landfill property consists of Westside Riparian
Wetlands (Table 1). This habitat is associated with the South Yamhill River in the 
southern portion of the site (Figure 2). Wetland hydrology or soils, periodic riverine 
flooding, or perennial flowing freshwater characterize this habitat. Westside Riparian
Wetlands habitat is generally found at elevations mostly below 3,000 ft (914 m) with 
topography typically flat to gently sloping or undulating, but can include moderate to 
steep slopes in the mountains. For the most part, this habitat consists of a structurally 

                                                                                             6

diverse forest dominated by native species. Water is sometimes present on the surface 
for a portion of the year. Snags with cavities and large woody debris are present. 
Common species include bigleaf maple, Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia), black 
cottonwood (Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), 
vine maple, hazelnut, rose, ocean spray (Holodiscus discolor), Oregon grape (Mahonia 
aquifolium), stinging nettle, hedge nettle (Stachys cooleyae) and sword fern. Further 
from the river, Oregon white oak and Douglasfir become more prevalent. In openings in 
the canopy, depressional, herbaceous wetlands can form. These are dominated by 
waterplantain (Alisma plantagoaquatica), spikerushes (Eleocharis spp.), rushes (Juncus 
spp.), sedges (Carex spp.) and low cudweed (Gnaphalium palustre).  

ManagementPrescriptions
Overall, the Riverbend Landfill site provides an array of different habitat types with 
varying complexity that supports many wildlife species. The total FRIHU for the entire 
623acre site is currently 4,301.5 (Table 1), which is relatively high for a rural, heavily 
agricultural setting. Wildlife habitat management activities are prescribed for many of 
the habitat types found on the site, with primary focus on the areas outside of the 
Landfill Operational Areas (Figure 2).  

UrbanandMixedEnvirons
The amount of wildlife habitat management than can occur within the Urban and Mixed 
Environs is limited by the designated use of the site as a landfill, which is subject to 
regulatory compliance. Wildlife management prescriptions include the following: 

         Use a multilayer composite cap designed to minimize infiltration from 
         precipitation over portions of the landfill that have been closed. Seed the area to 
         prevent erosion and maintain as part of ongoing operations. (Ongoing) 

         Control nonnative invasive species by periodic mowing prior to seed production. 
         Follow recommendations of Integrated Vegetation Control Prescriptions of 
         Common Weeds (Appendix B). (Ongoing) 

         Monitor nest box WD01 for use April through July. Maintain and clean the box 
         annually and repair/replace as necessary. (Ongoing) 

         Install and maintain a native wildflower garden adjacent to the office and barns 
         to provide habitat to pollinators such as native bees, butterflies and 
         hummingbirds (Completed and ongoing). Species for the wildflower mix consist 
         of the following:

         Mason bee nest blocks can be constructed from stumps and other untreated 
         large woody debris brought to the Landfill by the public. (Ongoing) 

WestsideLowlandConiferHardwoodForest
At the Riverbend Landfill site, this habitat consists of relatively narrow linear buffers 
along the southern boundary of HWY 18 and the poplar plantations. Wildlife 
management prescriptions include the following: 

         Control nonnative invasive species. Follow recommendations of Integrated 
         Vegetation Control Prescriptions of Common Weeds (Appendix B). 

Agriculture,PastureandMixedEnvirons

Ag­RowCrops
An unnamed creek currently traverse Row Crop habitat on the north side of HWY 18, 
crosses HWY 18, and enters the plantation and landfill area. The following prescriptions 
will improve the habitat quality by increasing the amount and structural diversity of 
native plant cover for hiding, nesting and thermoregulation; providing a riparian travel 


                                                                                                     8

corridor around the landfill activities; increasing the diversity and abundance of food 
sources; and increasing the diversity and amount of available water sources.  

         Add dead and down woody material to the channel and the adjacent riparian 
         corridor as material is available from landfill activities. (Ongoing) 

         Control nonnative species as needed. (Ongoing) 

Ag­ImprovedPasture
Approximately 4.1 acres of Improved Pasture are located adjacent to the RV Park. The 
Improved Pasture consists of mowed mixed grasses, which is used by visitors for 
recreation. All of this habitat type is located within the Landfill Expansion Area. The 
habitat management prescription in this area includes the following: 

         Install bluebird/swallow nest boxes around the perimeter of the Improved 
         Pasture south of the RV Park and along any remaining fencerows. Monitor the 
         nest boxes for use April through July. Maintain and clean the boxes annually and 
         repair/replace as necessary. (Ongoing) 

Ag­Nursery/Orchard/Vineyard
Approximately 55 acres of fruit and hazelnut orchards are located north of HWY 18. 
These areas are currently leased to farmers and agricultural activities are expected to 
continue. This habitat type also includes the hybrid poplar tree plantations and an 
approximately 9acre abandoned walnut plantation (northern Walnut Orchard. 
To the south of the Landfill Expansion Area, there is an approximately 15acre 
abandoned walnut plantation (southern Walnut Orchard), which lies adjacent to 
Westside RiparianWetlands and Westside Grasslands habitat. The following activities 
are prescribed to increase the species and structural diversity of this area: 

         Create openings in the walnut stand by removing mature trees to promote forest 
         structural development, enhance forest health, and improve overall wildlife 
         habitat value. Minimize disturbance to the vegetation and protect and create 
         habitat features of high value to wildlife (e.g. snags, large woody debris). The 
         objective should be to retain or promote staggered tree size classes within the 
         stand. (Ongoing) 

         During walnut thinning, retain as much of the existing native understory as 
         possible to enhance/maintain species and habitat diversity and provide for 
         future structural layering. (Ongoing) 

         Increase dead and down woody debris by leaving cut trees on site. Create brush 
         piles, up to two piles per acre, with the smaller limbs by hand piling. (Ongoing) 

         Minimize disturbance to existing downed logs and any large stumps during the 
         thinning activities. (Ongoing) 

                                                                                            9 
Riverbend Landfill                                                   Wildlife Management Plan 
 

         Create new snags from the larger walnut trees available at the time of entry, 
         with a shortterm goal of 2 ­ 3 snags per acre. Snags should be created by 
         girdling the trees. (Planned) 

         Monitor openings for regeneration of native and nonnative species. Control 
         nonnative invasive species, such as Himalayan blackberry, as needed. Plant 
         openings with a mix of native forbs, shrubs, and trees if generation of native 
         species is inadequate. (Ongoing) 

         If the native production within the openings is insufficient, consider planting 
         native shade tolerant forbs, shrubs, and trees under the remaining stand of 
         walnuts to develop a diverse multilayered canopy. Include western red cedars 
         to increase the coniferous component of the predominantly deciduous forest. 
         (Monitoring for need) 

Ag­UnimprovedPasture
Unimproved Pasture generally occurs within two areas on the site. The first area 
consists of approximately 6 acres, which lie to the west of the Landfill Operations Area, 
between the North and South Poplar Plantations. The second area of Unimproved 
Pasture consists of a 77acre block of habitat located south of the Landfill Operations 
Area, which has been used for hay production. About 47.7 acres of this area, including 
21.7 acres of uplands and 24.8 acres of degraded wetlands, has been proposed as a 
wetland mitigation bank (Figure 2). The creation of the wetland mitigation bank would 
involve removal approximately 1 million cubic yards of soil from the site to restore a 
more active flooding regime to the area.  

Wildlife habitat management prescriptions for the area outside of both the wetland 
mitigation bank include the following: 

         Install and maintain an osprey nest platform adjacent to the South Yamhill River 
         riparian area. (Complete ­ no occupancy yet, likely due to the presence of two 
         pairs of redtailed hawks in the area) 
         Create brush piles in the open areas to increase cover and perching areas for 
         small mammals and birds. (Complete/Ongoing) 

         An annual burn program with local Tribes is in the planning stages for the coming 
         years to attract grazers and reestablish a native grass/forb population. (Planning) 

Within the wetland mitigation bank area, habitat prescriptions include the following: 

         Proceed with excavation according to an approved grading plan to create 
         approximately 21.7 acres of wetlands and enhance 23.1 acres of wetlands. 
         (Ongoing) 




                                                                                           10 
Riverbend Landfill                                                     Wildlife Management Plan 
 

         Contour the excavation area to create undulating depressions facilitating a range 
         of target riparian wetland habitat types and hydrologic conditions. Restore 
         hydrologic regimes consistent with palustrine wetland seres typical of the area. 
         Increase the duration of seasonal hydrology in the large, degraded wetland 
         complex in the southern half of the bank site to support a welldeveloped 
         palustrine wetland community. (Ongoing) 

         Initially, allow the establishment of vegetation to occur naturally where possible, 
         i.e., self design. Plant areas as needed to provide erosion control. Monitor the 
         establishment of vegetation. Plant native species as needed if natural 
         recruitment is inadequate. Control nonnative invasive species, especially reed 
         canarygrass, as necessary. (Planning; following excavation) 

         Create a 200ft wide upland forested buffer consisting of native trees, shrubs, 
         forbs, and grasses between the northern bank boundary and the landfill. 
         (Planning; waiting for completion of ongoing excavation) 

         Protect, to the extent possible, existing riparian habitat along the South Yamhill 
         River to prevent erosion and ensure longterm bank stabilization. (Ongoing) 

         Install bat houses on southfacing trees or poles adjacent to streams and 
         wetlands. Inspect boxes in early spring to remove wasp nests. Clean and 
         maintain boxes every winter. (Ongoing ­ no occupancy yet, which can take 5 or 
         more years) 

WestsideGrasslands
The management prescriptions for this approximately 23acre habitat include the 
following: 

         Maintain grassland seral stage. Monitor encroachment of the adjacent forest 
         and nonnative invasive species, such as Himalayan blackberry. Follow the 
         Integrated vegetation Control Prescriptions for Common Weeds (Appendix B). 
         Time any necessary maintenance activities that require machinery to occur 
         outside of critical nesting periods for birds (i.e., spring through early summer) as 
         practicable. (Ongoing) 

         Install bluebird nest boxes around the perimeter of the grassland. Monitor the 
         nest boxes for use April through July. Maintain and clean the boxes annually and 
         repair/replace as necessary. (Complete/Ongoing) 

         Maintain the strip of Oregon ash trees in the draw that enters the southern 
         portion of site from the west. This small stand includes a redtailed hawk nest 
         that has been active for several years. (Ongoing) 

         Create brush piles in the open areas to increase cover and perching areas for 
         small mammals and birds. (Complete) 

                                                                                            11

Lakes,Rivers,Ponds,Reservoirs
This habitat is composed of the South Yamhill River. Management prescriptions include 
the following: 

         Maintain the riparian buffer around the South Yamhill River and ephemeral 
         tributaries. (Ongoing) 

         Maintain stormwater management facilities within the developed portions of 
         the landfill property to prevent increased stormwater runoff volume and 
         velocity, as well as erosion and turbidity. (Ongoing; required by permit) 

         Increase the riparian buffer width through creation of the wetland mitigation 
         bank and conversion of the Row Crop habitat west of the river to forested 
         habitat. (Ongoing) 

         Install bat houses on southfacing trees or poles adjacent to streams and 
         wetlands. Inspect boxes in early spring to remove wasp nests. Clean and 
         maintain boxes every winter. (Planned) 

WestsideRiparianWetlands
No habitat management activities have been prescribed for this habitat type at this 
time, except to preserve and maintain its integrity. It is composed of a mixed forest 
dominated by native species with varying stand structure. This habitat type is expected 
to increase from approximately 71 acres to more than 145 acres over time, as the 
habitat enhancement activities within the walnut plantation proceed and the wetland 
mitigation bank has been created.  

Summary
Overall, the Riverbend Landfill provides an array of different habitat types with varying 
complexity that supports many wildlife species. Currently, the total FRI HU for the entire 
623acre site is 4,301.5 (Table 1). The estimated FRI HU for future conditions of the site 
after creation of the wetland mitigation bank and the habitat management activities 
described above is approximately 6,248.8.

Mowing Regime for Weed Control in Wetlands
       Set mower to 68 inches. Avoid areas that do not have weeds. 

       Mow wetlands with meadow foxtail as soon as foxtail has bloomed and ground 
       in dry enough to facilitate mowing, usually mid May. 

       In areas where spring wetland plants are blooming, mow during mid to late June 
       before foxtail, if present, sets seed. 

       Mow again in late August or early September to control late summer weeds, 
       such as teasel, blackberry, and others that flower or continue to grow well later 
       in the year.

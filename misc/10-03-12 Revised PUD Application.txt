                       Specific Requirement: Completed PUD Application

                       2. Narrative (2.8.9.1.2)

                       Specific Requirement: Narrative, including a statement of purpose for the PUD and how it
                       meets the goals of this Section.
                       This document is an update to the original submission of October 14, 2011 with
                       enhanced information at the request of the Town of Londonderry.

                       Statement of Purpose
                       The owners' (Pillsbury Realty Development, LLC., HYRAX Derry Partners LLC,
                       Demoulas Super Markets Inc., and Robert D. and Stephen R. Lievens, hereafter all
                       referred to as "Applicant") goals are to create a revenue-positive mixed-use live, work,
                       play community to be known as Woodmont Commons using traditional neighborhood
                       development principles that will compliment, blend with and augment the existing
                       community. Woodmont Commons is intended to constitute a single PUD.

                       Woodmont Commons is intended to be a mixed-use and pedestrian-friendly
                       development that, in many respects, will emulate historic, walkable, New Hampshire
                       and New England towns that pre-date the invention of the automobile.

                       The Applicant recognizes that:

                           ·   Land is a non-renewable resource and that it and other natural resources are
                               limited; and
                           ·   Many societal needs, particularly those of senior citizens and children, are not
                               well served by most current development concepts that segregate and separate
                               land uses and require reliance on vehicular travel.

                       The Applicant further notes that the Project will promote:

                           ·   The provision and maintenance of adequate public services and infrastructure;

Revised Submittal October 3, 2012                                                                       Page 4
                           ·   Multi-modal transportation (including foot traffic), and which regulate the
                               design of public spaces ­ streets, squares, plazas, greens, parks ­ for the use and
                               enjoyment of its citizens;
                           ·   An adequate supply of housing which is affordable to households at differing
                               income levels;
                           ·   A strong sense of community identity based on a shared, coherent, functionally-
                               efficient physical environment and a shared economic, legal, political, social,
                               and cultural environment;
                           ·   Policies and procedures designed to mitigate traffic congestion, conserve energy,
                               provide an alternative means of developing land and otherwise promote public
                               health, safety, and welfare.

                       The Applicant further notes that many American cities and towns established between
                       1690 and 1940 are examples of Applicant's development approach and, as such,
                       continue to be desirable places for today's population to live, work, shop, and recreate.
                       Such places, developed prior to suburban sprawl and the creation of the interstate
                       highway system, accommodate pedestrians as well as vehicles within their built-up fabric.
                       Characteristics of these traditional neighborhoods include:

                           ·   Dwellings, shops, and workplaces located in close proximity to each other;
                           ·   Buildings fronting on, and aligned with, streets in a disciplined manner,
                               generally uninterrupted by parking lots;
                           ·   Regular geometric patterns of streets and blocks arranged to provide
                               comprehensible and interesting routes of travel;
                           ·   A hierarchy of streets ­ some narrow and convenient for a balanced mix of both
                               pedestrians and automobiles while others are wider to carry greater traffic and
                               perhaps serve as the major ceremonial avenue, boulevard, or commercial main

                               patterns and dedicated to collective social activity, recreation, and visual
                               enjoyment;
                           ·   Civic buildings for assembly, or for other civic purposes, sited to act as visual
                               landmarks and symbols of identity within the community;
                           ·   A recognizable, functionally diverse, visually unified neighborhood or village
                               center, often focused on a major civic space such as a village green or square
                               frequently also linked to a traditionally important cross-roads or waterfront;
                           ·   A built-up neighborhood area with an overall size small enough to permit
                               residents and workers, if they so choose, to walk or ride bicycles comfortably
                               rather than being required to drive.

                       Since many of the unique characteristics of the Project's proposed appearance, including
                       but not limited to its streets and buildings are difficult to describe, with sufficient detail
                       and accuracy, images are used throughout this document to show the intended character
                       and nature of the Project, as well as to explain, pursuant to section 2.8.10.2 of the PUD

                       Except where specially-captioned, the placement of images in this document is not
                       intended to specifically correlate with the adjacent text, but rather to be representative of

                       illustrative and conceptual purposes only.

                       Notwithstanding Applicant's intent to develop traditional neighborhoods, Applicant also
                       recognizes that nearby contemporary shopping plazas already exist and that such areas
                       should be integrated into the Woodmont Commons vision where practicable.

                       Review Criteria and Conformance (2.8.8)
                       Specific Requirement: The following criteria shall guide the Planning Board in determining
                       appropriate land uses, densities, and other development standards for the PUD. It is
                       emphasized that the determination of whether or not a proposal meets the intent and
                       objectives of this ordinance is made by the Planning Board in its reasonable discretion.


                       General Considerations (2.8.8.1)
                       Specific Requirement: The Planning Board shall consider the following:
                       Woodmont Commons meets the goals and objectives of the PUD Ordinance through
                       the inclusion of the following elements, as listed under section 2.8.8 of the Town's PUD
                       Ordinance, which validates the Applicant's intent to depart from standards otherwise
                       applicable under conventional zoning and related land use regulations.

                       Appropriate Regulatory Consistency (2.8.8.1.1)
                       Specific Requirement: Provisions of Town of Londonderry Zoning Ordinance, Site Plan
                       Regulations, Subdivision Regulations, and other applicable Town, state and federal law,
                       where appropriate.
                       Woodmont Commons is a large scale development that has been Master Planned to
                       create a comprehensive, integrated Planned Unit Development that would be impossible
                       to create under the existing Zoning Ordinance, site plan regulations, subdivision
                       regulations and other related land use regulations. All aspects of the Project have been
                       planned to be of high quality and in accordance with this application, as well as the
                       specific requirements of the PUD portion of Londonderry's Zoning Ordinance.

                       Consistent with the flexibilities in the PUD Ordinance, the specific provisions of the
                       Town's Conservation Overlay District, the Floodplain Development Ordinance and the
                       Local Excavation Standards shall not apply to the Project; instead State and Federal
                       regulations shall apply. All excavation activities in the Project shall be deemed incidental
                       to construction and exempt from permitting pursuant to RSA 155-E: 2-a (I) (a).

                       Due to the unique nature of the Project, and as set forth in section 2.8.2.1 of the PUD,
                       in order to fulfill the Narrative and Statement of Purpose, the Project needs to be

                       independent from existing and otherwise applicable land use regulations, including
                       subdivision and site plan regulations and the Zoning Ordinance. Section 2.8.8.2 of the
                       PUD Ordinance also justifies departures from standards and guidelines otherwise
                       applicable in Londonderry. Therefore, concerning all of the Project Master Plan,
                       instances of conflicts between the Project Master Plan and any other Town standard,
                       Ordinance regulation or guideline, the Project Master Plan shall control. See PUD
                       Ordinance 2.8.3.6. It is Applicant's intent however, to imply a comprehensive standard
                       for development throughout the Project. See PUD Ordinance 2.8.10.2.

                       Consistent with the purposes of all PUDs in allowing a landowner to "propose his/her
                       own development project largely independent from current land use regulations,"
                       development within Woodmont Commons shall be exempt from The Town of
                       Londonderry's impact fees. Instead, Section 2.8 of the Ordinance, and this Master Plan,
                       are predicated on Applicant's provision or arrangement for adequate public facilities
                       necessitated by net growth. As such, the cost of new or expanded municipal capital
                       facilities is anticipated to be minimal and the premise supporting the imposition of
                       impact fees is inapplicable.

                       Master Plan Consistency (2.8.8.1.2)
                       Specific Requirement: Consistency with the Town of Londonderry Master Plan, and any
                       related plans or studies (such as the Londonderry Business Park Design Charrette, Northwest
                       Small Areas Master Plan, etc.)
                       Woodmont Commons is in conformance with many of the goals and visions contained
                       in the Town's 2004 Master Plan. These include a diversity of housing types; the
                       provision of complete, multi-modal streets; the encouragement of walking and bicycling
                       which promote good health; the proposed development at Exit 4A from Route 93; and a
                       diverse range of economic development opportunities.

                       Conformance with Londonderry PUD Ordinance (2.8.8.1.3)
                       Specific Requirement: Conformance with the intent and objectives of this Section.
                       As is demonstrated by the breadth of the entire Woodmont Commons PUD
                       submission, the intent and objectives of the PUD are consistently addressed and met.

                       The Planning Board may grant waivers from this Master Plan, the Site Plan Regulations
                       and the Subdivision Regulations in instances where the requested relief may be granted
                       without substantial detriment to the public good and such a waiver will not affect the
                       purpose and intent of the Master Plan.

                       Infrastructure Capacity and Public Services and Safety (2.8.8.1.4)
                       Specific Requirement: Infrastructure capacity and the effect of the PUD upon public services
                       and public safety.
                       This is fully addressed below under 2.8.9.2.14 of the Submission Requirements.

                       Prospective Town Fiscal Impact (2.8.8.1.5)
                       Specific Requirement: Prospective fiscal impact upon the Town of Londonderry.
                       A fiscal impact study has been agreed upon with the Town's consulting review team and
                       will be submitted during the 65-day review period. One goal of Woodmont Commons
                       is to be revenue positive for the Town.

                       The determination of whether the Project is Revenue Positive is hereby established by
                       adding the following to create the Sum:

                           ·   All real estate, rooms and meals and other taxes paid by the Project or any
                               portion of the Project directly or indirectly to the Town;
                           ·   All donations to the Town, by the Project or any portion of the Project at retail
                               value where applicable;
                           ·   All fees paid to the Town for the Project or any portion of the Project, including
                               application fees;
                           ·   All current use land use change fees by the Project or any portion of the Project;
                           ·   Any other contribution given to the Town by the Project or any portion of the
                               Project.

                       The above Sum shall have a beginning date of October 14, 2010 and shall continue
                       until the last residential Dwelling Unit building permit in the Project is issued.

                       So long as the above Sum exceeds the expense to the municipality of providing essential
                       services to the Project-area, the Project is Revenue Positive.

                       Specific Objectives (2.8.8.2)
                       Specific Requirement: Every PUD should incorporate a number of the following elements.
                       Their usage defines a planned unit development and justifies departures from standards
                       otherwise applicable under conventional zoning (introduction of new uses, more intensive
                       land uses, higher density, novel design approaches, etc.).
                       The following criteria shall guide the Planning Board in determining appropriate land
                       uses, densities, and other development standards for the PUD. It is emphasized that the
                       determination of whether or not a proposal meets the intent and objectives of this
                       ordinance is made by the Planning Board in its reasonable discretion. The following
                       outline how Woodmont Commons meets the goals and objectives of the PUD
                       Ordinance through the inclusion of the following elements, as listed under section 2.8.8
                       of the Town's PUD Ordinance, which validates the Applicant's intent to depart from
                       standards otherwise applicable under conventional zoning and related land use
                       regulations.

                       Mix of Uses (2.8.8.2.1)
                       Specific Requirement: Inclusion of a harmonious mix of uses.
                       Woodmont Commons will have several neighborhood centers providing a mix of
                       residential, commercial, retail, office and recreational uses. These elements will be
                       horizontally and vertically integrated where possible to provide a public realm accessible
                       by different modes of transportation. The size and scale of these centers will vary
                       depending on the local needs, population densities and their locations within the
                       Project.

                       Consistent with characteristics of the Use Zone, and the land uses permitted therein,
                       noise created by any use in the Project shall not unreasonably impact others.

                       Architectural Design (2.8.8.2.2)
                       Specific Requirement: Provisions for quality architectural design.
                       Woodmont Commons' architectural design will emulate the good characteristics of
                       classic and walkable New England communities. While individual proposals will be
                       subject to planning review and site-specific approval requirements, the images contained
                       throughout this document and in 18. Architecture (2.8.9.2.18) on page 73 are intended
                       to convey the conceptual styles of buildings and places to be constructed. A civic
                       building should convey its purpose and civic nature as a part of the structure's design.

                       Placement of Structures (2.8.8.2.3)
                       Specific Requirement: Placement of structures on most suitable sites with consideration of
                       topography, soils, vegetation, slope, etc.
                       The Master Plan takes into account, in proposed building placement, open space, and
                       recreational areas, the topography, soils, vegetation and slopes.

                       Open Space (2.8.8.2.4)
                       Specific Requirement: Preservation of open space.
                       Woodmont Commons will include areas of publicly accessible open space. Walking
                       trails will run throughout many areas of the site. Many dwellings will also be in close
                       proximity to a park or green, and many of the streets will be designed to be linear parks
                       for pedestrians and bicyclists. The Applicant intends to dedicate publicly accessible open
                       space to a municipal or non-profit entity.

                       Natural Vegetation and Features (2.8.8.2.5)
                       Specific Requirement: Preservation of natural vegetation and other important natural
                       features.
                       In certain areas, such as along Gilcreast Road, apple trees will serve as a buffer. Elsewhere
                       around the site a buffer of at least 50' will be preserved around the Project's overall
                       perimeter.

                       Careful consideration will be taken to preserve and enhance the natural vegetation that
                       exists within Woodmont Commons. Where possible, these naturalized green spaces will
                       integrate with greenways, the stormwater plan, and the continuous site buffers depicted
                       in the Master Plan.

                       In a few locations, past land use practices have altered the naturally occurring conditions.

                       Cultural Resources (2.8.8.2.6)
                       Specific Requirement: Preservation of important cultural resources such as stone walls and
                       other archaeological sites.
                       There are few remaining stone walls in the Project. Some land in the north of
                       Woodmont Commons will be offered to the Town for preservation and expansion of the
                       cemetery that is located on Hovey Road.

                       Recreational Areas (2.8.8.2.7)
                       Specific Requirement: Development of active or passive recreational areas.
                       Many residents in Woodmont Commons will have easy accessibility to recreational land
                       areas. The type and size of these areas will vary from small playgrounds, to open space,
                       to larger fields for activities such as soccer and baseball. Some of the streets themselves
                       will have similarities with linear parks, promoting walking and bicycling both as a viable
                       means of transportation and as recreation.

                       Landscaping (2.8.8.2.8)
                       Specific Requirement: Quality landscaping.
                       Landscaping is often utilized in suburban settings to provide buffers between land uses
                       and between buildings and streets and parking areas. In some parts of the Project,
                       especially W-2-1, W-2-2, W-2-1-GL, W-2-10 and E-2-1, commercial and mixed-use
                       lots will not be required to have private landscaping. Trees within the street Right-of-
                       Way, window boxes and other potted plants will be encouraged. Special emphasis will be
                       placed on wooded features that promote groundwater recharge and long term nutrient
                       storage. These locations will be designed to complement and enhance the Stormwater
                       Plan. Invasive plant species will not be permitted.

                       Pedestrian Circulation (2.8.8.2.9)
                       Specific Requirement: Use of sidewalks, bikeways, and other multi-use paths.
                       As illustrated in the Appendix 3: Streets Specifications and Palette, most streets within
                       the Project will have sidewalks on one or both sides of the street. Bicycle travel will be
                       encouraged and integrated into the transportation system where appropriate. A series of
                       trails or walkways separated from vehicular traffic will exist in select areas, such as
                       adjacent to the future pond. Sidewalk and bikeway improvements along adjacent
                       existing public streets may be impracticable due to impacts to private property, utilities,
                       or other important resources, such as the desire to preserve existing trees.

                       Traffic (2.8.8.2.10)
                       Specific Requirement: Use of traffic mitigation, calming, or Transportation Demand
                       Management measures.
                       In order to maintain safety and accessibility for pedestrians and bicyclists, traffic must be
                       calmed, and most of the streets in Woodmont Commons will be designed to encourage
                       lower vehicle speeds. Traffic impact studies will be done as part of the development
                       process to ensure that the appropriate traffic mitigation measures are incorporated at the
                       appropriate times. Also, Transportation Demand Management strategies to further
                       mitigate vehicle impacts have been incorporated into the Master Plan.

                       Parking Area Screening (2.8.8.2.11)
                       Specific Requirement: Significant screening of, or rear placement of, parking areas.
                       Except in Use Zones W-2-1-GL and E-2-1, where impracticable and where now
                       existing, permanent parking lots will generally be placed in the rear of buildings or
                       otherwise significantly screened. On-street parking will be utilized in most parts of
                       Woodmont Commons to reduce the size of surface lots, slow the speed of vehicles and
                       to separate vehicle traffic from pedestrian traffic.

                       No screening is proposed in W-1 as the buildings will be designed to frame the street.

                       In Use Zone E-1, some screening may be required to soften the visual impact of
                       buildings, parking areas, loading docks, trash disposal areas, exterior storage and other

                       potentially unsightly areas as viewed from primarily traveled rights-of-way and parcels
                       adjacent to the Project tract boundary. The above mentioned features do not need to be
                       screened within alleys and rear lanes because these areas are designed to be limited access
                       points.

                       Sustainable Design and Construction (2.8.8.2.12)
                       Specific Requirement: Sustainable design and construction practices promoting energy
                       conservation.
                       One of the fundamental benefits of building compact, walkable developments, in terms
                       of energy conservation, is a reduction in vehicle miles traveled and the ability to use safer
                       alternatives to the private vehicle. Woodmont Commons will be designed with several
                       neighborhood centers, which will accommodate commercial users offering daily goods
                       and services. Sustainable design and construction practices as well as energy conservation
                       will be encouraged.

                       Other Public Benefits (2.8.8.2.13)
                       Specific Requirement: Other public benefits such as provision of a community center or day
                       care center.
                       The Applicant is offering to provide lands for the expansion of the Town cemetery. Day
                       care, Community Centers and Civic Uses are permitted in many Use Zones.

                       Public Access (2.8.8.2.14)
                       Specific Requirement: Public access to community facilities in PUD.
                       Municipally-owned or operated community facilities in Woodmont Commons will be
                       publicly accessible.

                       3. Proposed Land Plan (2.8.9.1.3)

                       Specific Requirement: Proposed land plan.

                        In addition to the above and as set forth in Section 2.8.6.2 of the PUD Ordinance, any
                       uses that exist or are permitted in the underlying zoning district either by right, special
                       exception, or conditional use permit are also permitted uses in the Project. Existing legal
                       and non-conforming uses are allowed to continue.

                       All existing uses conforming with the underlying zoning may legally continue unless and
                       until being re-developed pursuant to this Master Plan.

                       All existing Dwelling Units and existing commercial spaces of all types are excluded from
                       all of the maximum limitations imposed by the Master Plan (Limitations). Any existing
                       Dwelling Unit or commercial space may be relocated or reconstructed. Any net increase
                       in reconstructed commercial space shall count toward any use affected by Limitations.

                       Buildings may contain multiple and mixed uses, with these uses varying both vertically
                       and horizontally within a single building or on a single lot. All allowed uses are
                       permitted to be combined within one structure or lot as a Principal use with allowed
                       Accessory uses. Uses within buildings are also allowed to vary over time, consistent with
                       the other provisions and restrictions herein.

                       As a guideline to the above, TND 4 on page 17 summarizes the allowed and not allowed
                       uses in the Project by sub-district.

INFORMATION (2.8.9.2)



                       Information (2.8.9.2)

                       Specific Requirement: The applicant for a PUD shall provide the following information.
                       Given the amount of information needed it is recommended that the plan be developed and
                       refined through several conceptual /preliminary iterations with the staff and Planning Board.
                       Many of these items may be presented as approximations or preliminary estimates subject to
                       change, where appropriate.

                       2. Geographic Information (2.8.9.2.2)

                       Specific Requirement: Topographic and other information on the tract including soil types,
                       wetlands, surface water, land contours, natural and cultural resources, ridges and knolls, rock
                       outcrops, steep slopes, etc. This information may be presented in an overview format, in less
                       detail than would be required of a site plan or subdivision application provided that a clear
                       sense of the tract is conveyed sufficient to evaluate the PUD proposal (for example, wetlands
                       need not be professionally delineated if potentially wet low lying areas are roughly indicated).
                       Topographic information on the tract including soil types, wetlands, surface water, land
                       contours, ridges and knolls, rock outcrops, steep slopes are shown in overview and with
                       some specificity on TND 5 on page 22 and TND 11 on page 23. There are a limited
                       number of stone walls and the PUD abuts an existing cemetery, but otherwise there are
                       no other known cultural resources. Topography is generally rolling and soils vary on
                       both sides of Route 93. Soils data may be found in detail online:
                       http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/HomePage.htm.

                       Small PUD Hotels and PUD Bed and Breakfast Facilities
                       In the Project, both the Small Hotel and PUD Bed and Breakfast uses are allowed as
                       principal uses.

                       In PUD Bed and Breakfast facilities, the only full meal service to be provided guests shall
                       be breakfast, and it shall only be served to guests taking lodging in the facility (lodgers).
                       Afternoon and evening tea service and cocktails are also permitted for lodgers and their
                       guests.

                       Small PUD Hotels may provide full meal services.

                       Rooms used for sleeping may either be part of the primary residential structure or as
                       cottages specifically constructed for rental purposes

                       The principal structures comprising both Small Hotels and PUD Bed and Breakfast
                       facilities shall be constructed to emulate larger residential homes.

                       There is no limitation on stay duration for individual guests at a particular PUD Small
                       Hotel or PUD Bed and Breakfast establishment.

                       Nature of Master Plan and Allowable Changes
                       Use Zones E-1 and W-1 are anticipated to be different in nature, with W-1 containing
                       more mixed-use walkable neighborhoods and locations. E-1 will also be walkable and
                       mixed-use, but it may contain larger buildings for larger commercial tenants and owners.

                       Within Use Zones E-1 and W-1, any use may change its location, so long as the
                       structure(s) and character of the proposed use remain substantially the same.

                       As a pair of examples, in the following diagrams, the large red building on a Master Plan
                       moves northeast, becomes larger, and is replaced by more mixed-use buildings where it
                       was originally proposed.

                       Such changes are consistent with the flexibility inherent in a planned unit development
                       and therefore do not require a Master Plan amendment.

                       The Master Plan documents also establish the overall maxima.

                       Street alignments depicted on the Master Plan are not final, and both the alignments
                       and types of streets may change during Site Plan and/or Subdivision Plan stages of the
                       Project.

                       A pair of illustrated plans follows, and by these terms and definition, from a Master Plan
                       perspective, they are the same, and are also the same as the currently proposed Master
                       Plan.

                       5. Residential Uses (2.8.9.2.5)

                       Specific Requirement: Proposed total number of dwelling units and overall residential density
                       for the tract (if applicable).
                       See TND 1 on page 13 and TND 2 on page 14; up to 1,300 dwelling units plus up to
                       130 Accessory Apartments on approximately 625 acres which equates to 2.3 units/acre.

                       Residential Unit Limitations
                       In order to encourage the creation of significant new neighborhoods of mixed uses, ages
                       and incomes, except as outlined in the Applicant's response to section 2.8.9.2.14, and so
                       long as the Project is Revenue Positive there shall be no annual growth limits on the
                       number of residential units nor any limits on building permits for residential units.

                       Accessory apartments
                       Accessory apartments shall be allowed throughout the Project, and such units shall count
                       toward the maximum dwelling unit limitations.

                       land internal to the Project, then changes with a Master Plan Amendment are permitted
                       so long as residential use is maintained along adjacent residential lots.

                       6. Use Distribution (2.8.9.2.6)

                       Specific Requirement: Proposed general estimates of location, size, use(s) for each structure.
                       See TND 1 on page 13 and photographic examples herein. The westerly portion of the
                       Project is expected to have more of a village component; the easterly side of Route 93
                       may have larger buildings and mixed-uses.

                       The TND sheets are to scale, therefore the structures shown thereon are to scale and
                       represent "general estimates of the location, size and (in the text descriptions) uses for
                       each structure."

                       By way of additional description, an area designated as "Retail/Mixed-Use/Apartment" is
                       an area that is predominantly retail, then mixed-use, then apartments; an area designated
                       as "Attached Residential/Mixed-Use" is an area that is predominantly residential with a
                       mixed-use component ­ physically, these two areas will be very similar.

                       As-Built Plans
                       All commercial site plans, multi-unit dwellings, condominiums and zero-lot line
                       buildings in the Project shall have their as-built locations measured and drawn on
                       surveys suitable for recording at the Rockingham County Registry of Deeds.

                       Lot Boundaries/Monumentation
                       Since the entire PUD will be developed in a computer-aided drafting system (CAD) and
                       since boundaries between units will be combinations of: both interior and exterior
                       building walls; ceilings; roofs; basement areas; and, conventional lot lines there will be
                       no requirement to conventionally monument every boundary. Provided, however, that
                       single family home parcels located in perimeter parcels in Use Zones W-2-5 through W-
                       2-7, W-2-9 and W-2-11 shall have their lot lines monumented with rebar or other
                       suitably permanent markers.

                       Property lines in the Project may have any alignment.

                       General Provisions
                       There are no minimum frontages or maximum lot coverage provisions in the Project
                       except in the yellow shaded residential Use Zones W-2-5 through W-2-7, W-2-9 and
                       W-2-11 where lots shall generally be as depicted on TND 1 on page 13.

                       There are no minimum Front, Side or Rear Setbacks requirements in the Project except
                       in the yellow shaded residential Use Zones W-2-5 through W-2-7, W-2-9 and W-2-11
                       where lots shall generally be as depicted on TND 1 on page 13 and buildings will
                       generally be located in the central portions of lots, and Rear Setbacks shall apply.

                       Building Height Limitation
                       Except for portions of Buildings not designed for human habitation or occupancy such
                       as steeples, belfries and clock towers, Building Heights may not exceed fifty feet (50').

                       Office Buildings
                       Office Buildings may only be located along the Route 93 corridor, hereby established as
                       those portions of the Project within 1,000 feet of the Route 93 Right-of-Way or within
                       E-1.

                       7. Circulation Infrastructure (2.8.9.2.7)

                       Specific Requirement: Proposed general estimates of location, width, and materials of all
                       streets, drives, sidewalks, and paths.
                       All streets, alleys, boulevards and other thoroughfares in the Project will be in general
                       conformity with the spirit and intent of this document and the exemplar streets depicted
                       in the Project Street Specifications and Palette (SSP) in Appendix 3. The Board, as a part
                       of site plan or other review of a specific proposal, may allow street types in addition to
                       the exemplars shown in the SSP. Streets in the Project will not be classified according to
                       conventional functional classification nor subject to any requirements pertaining to such
                       classifications. Streets and pathways may have surface treatments that are not asphalt and
                       may include brick, cobblestone, and for pathways, crushed gravel or decomposed
                       granite. Additional surface treatment materials may also be used as appropriate for the
                       neighborhood.

                       Also see TND 1 on page 13, TND 3A on page 32 and the Street Specification Palette in
                       Appendix 3.

                       Street alignments depicted on the Master Plan are not final, and both the alignments
                       and types of streets may change during Site Plan and/or Subdivision Plan stages of the
                       Project.

                       Driveways, Site Access and Design Criteria
                       Each driveway providing site access from a street or other public Right-of-Way shall be
                       designed, constructed, and properly maintained in compliance with the following. The
                       Board may waive the requirements of this Section.

                              A. Number of driveways

                                   1. Single-family dwellings and duplexes. No limitations on drives.

                                   2. Multi-family and nonresidential projects.

                                             a) A multi-family or nonresidential development project on a
                                                parcel of two acres or less shall be limited to a maximum of
                                                two driveways, unless the Board determines that more than
                                                two driveways are required to accommodate the traffic for the
                                                project.

                                             b) Whenever a property has access to more than one street, access
                                               should be generally be directed to the lower volume street.

                              B. Driveways and sidewalks ­ Driveways shall not be designed to allow parked
                                 vehicles to back across a sidewalk, unless it is a residential use that has a
                                 width of two vehicles or less or is an infrequently used and signed service
                                 driveway for other uses.

                              C. Distance from street corners ­ Each driveway should be separated from the
                                 nearest street intersection as follows, except where the Board allows less
                                 separation:

                                   1. A minimum of 100 feet from the nearest intersection of two streets, as
                                      measured from the centerline of the driveway to the centerline of the
                                      nearest travel lane of the intersecting street; and

                                   2. For parcels with frontages of less than 150 feet, the minimum distance
                                      shall be 75 feet.

                              D. Driveway spacing ­ Driveways should be separated along a street frontage as
                                 follows.

                                   1. Single-family and duplex residential developments. Driveways should be
                                      shared or separated by six feet.

                                   2. Multi-family and nonresidential developments. Where two or more
                                      driveways serve the same or adjacent multi-family or nonresidential
                                      development, the centerline of the driveways should be separated by
                                      approximately 40 to 50 feet. The Board may approve exceptions to this
                                      standard, and this guideline does not apply to parking structures or lots
                                      located inside blocks.

                              E. Driveway dimensions ­ Dimensions and sight distances shall adhere to
                                 reasonable safety protocols and this Master Plan.

                              F. Clearance from obstructions.

                                    1. The nearest edge of a driveway curb cut shall be at least two feet from a
                                       property line unless it is a common driveway and three feet from the
                                       centerline of a fire hydrant, light standard, traffic signal, utility pole, or
                                       other similar facility.

                              G. Traffic safety visibility areas ­ Trees, street lights, pedestrian wayfinding
                                 systems and other amenities are encouraged along all streets in the Project.
                                 There are no limitations on the placement of these features or buildings near
                                 any signalized intersections. Around unsignalized intersections, structures or
                                 landscaping are allowed, provided they do not create significant obstructions
                                 to pedestrians or excessively block drivers' vision; trees are always permitted
                                 with their lower canopy trimmed up to a minimum of 5 feet from the
                                 ground within 75 feet of an unsignalized intersection.

                              H. Intersection Spacing ­ Intersections may be as close as 75' for two-way
                                 streets and 50' for one-way streets, measured centerline to centerline.

                              I.   Street Rights of Way ­ In order to allow buildings to better shape the spaces
                                   along streets and around intersections, street Rights-of-Way may meet
                                   without connecting radii.

                       8. Parking (2.8.9.2.8)

                       Specific Requirement: Proposed general estimates of location and number of spaces for each
                       parking area.
                       See TND 3 on page 15 and TND 6 on page 36. The area west of Route 93 as currently
                       shown depicts approximately 1,500 striped on-street spaces and another 3,550 of off-
                       street per level of parking. Easterly of 93, the plan shows approximately 1,600 striped
                       on-street spaces and another 2,600 per level of off-street parking.

                       All parking in the Project shall be in conformance with the Project parking criteria and
                       guidelines.

                       Parking/Loading
                       This section is intended to provide a comprehensive set of parking and loading criteria.

                           ·   Mitigate environmental, economic, and social impacts associated with parking;
                           ·   Reduce the amount of land devoted to parking;
                           ·   Reduce inefficient, dispersed, and single-use reserved parking;
                           ·   Maximize on-street parking opportunities;
                           ·   Encourage the use of alternative transportation modes and reduce vehicle use;
                           ·   Improve community livability, walkability, and character; and
                           ·   Provide flexibility in accommodating changes in demand and use.

                       Applicability
                       Parking required ­ Unless waived or modified by the Board as a part of the site plan or
                       other review of a specific proposal, each new PUD building and new land use, including
                       an expansion of a building or land use, will provide parking in compliance with this
                       section.

                       Number of Parking Spaces
                       The number of parking spaces allocated for each land use shall be determined as follows:

                       Basic space requirement ­ Each land use shall provide the number of parking spaces
                       outlined in Table AP, as applicable, except where the requirement is reduced or
                       otherwise changed in compliance with the Reduction of Parking Requirements. If a land
                       use shares its parking publicly (i.e. not reserved), it shall provide parking consistent with
                       the "shared" requirement rows in Table AP. If a land use reserves its parking exclusively
                       for that use alone, it must provide parking consistent with the "reserved" requirement
                       rows in Table AP. Single-family detached dwellings shall provide two spaces per
                       dwelling.

                           1. On-street Parking ­ Except in the Use Zone W-2-1GL, generally, continuous
                           head-in or parallel parking will be provided along streets where Commercial uses
                           predominate. It is Applicant's intent to allow parallel along most other streets.
                           2. Parking Space Allocation ­ For other than Shared Parking, parking spaces may be
                           considered allocated to a particular Lot, or use, if those spaces are entirely on that
                           Lot or the use of the spaces has been assured by assignment through easement or
                           other legal guaranty. On-street parking may be allocated to a particular Lot when a
                           particular on-street space abuts a particular Lot. Where an on-street space abuts
                           more than one Lot, a particular parking space may be allocated to a particular Lot
                           only if more than 66% of the space abuts that Lot or if that space has otherwise been
                           legally assigned to that Lot or use. On-street parking shall be counted toward
                           fulfilling parking requirements. See also the phased development provisions for
                           temporary parking in the Reduction of Parking Requirements below.

                           3. Disabled (ADA) Parking ­ Parking for the disabled shall be provided on site in
                           compliance with applicable Building Code Standards. Parking spaces required for
                           the disabled shall count toward compliance with the number of parking spaces
                           required by this Chapter.
                           4. Use with Accessory Components ­ A single use with accessory components shall
                           provide parking for each component. For example, a hotel with a restaurant shall
                           provide the parking spaces required by Table AP on page 39 for a hotel (e.g., the
                           guest rooms), and for a restaurant, except where the requirement is reduced or
                           otherwise changed in compliance with the Reduction of Parking Requirements
                           below.
                           5. Expansion of Structure ­ For additions or enlargements of existing buildings or
                           uses that would increase the number of parking spaces required, the additional
                           parking shall be required only for such addition, enlargement or change, and not for
                           the pre-existing building or use.
                           6. Change in Use ­ For any change of occupancy or manner of operation that may
                           increase the number of parking spaces required, no additional parking shall be
                           required unless the Board determines that the change in use without added parking
                           would create a negative impact for neighboring properties.
                           7. Excessive Parking ­ The Applicant will discourage a use from providing more
                           parking spaces than the maximum number allowed in Table AP on page 39, in
                           order to avoid the inefficient use of land, unnecessary pavement, and excessive storm
                           water runoff from paved surfaces. The maximum number of spaces allowed varies
                           based on whether spaces are to be reserved for on-site tenants and visitors, or to be
                           shared parking. This creates an incentive to share on-site parking, particularly
                           among development with the capacity to provide extra parking ­ a management
                           strategy that has proven effective in reducing cumulative parking needs within
                           commercial centers. By encouraging the sharing of these larger facilities, nearby uses
                           will be able to reduce their own estimated parking needs. The higher maximum
                           option also provides important flexibility to encourage development within infill
                           areas.
                           8. Floor Area ­ Where Table AP on page 39 expresses a parking requirement based
                           on gross leasable area (for example: 1 space for each 1,000 GLA), the term "gross
                           leasable area" shall mean gross leasable square footage of floor area. Gross leasable
                           floor area is the total building area designed for tenant occupancy and exclusive use,
                           including any basements, mezzanines, or upper floors. It is the area for which
                           tenants pay rent; it is the area that produces income, as defined by the Institute of
                           Transportation Engineers (ITE).
                           9. Parking Type ­ Where Tables E and W express a parking type, the term "shared"
                           shall mean parking that is publicly available and "reserved" shall mean parking that
                           is reserved exclusively for the use of those occupying the land use.
                           10. Use Zones ­ Where Table AP on page 39 references Use Zones, see the TND 3
                           on page 15.

                              performed in compliance with this Chapter, one additional parking space shall be
                              required for a fractional unit of 0.50 or above, and no additional space shall be
                              required for a fractional unit of less than 0.50.

                           * Urban Land Institute's Shared Parking, as amended, incorporated herein by reference



                       Motorcycle Parking
                       A parking lot with 100 or more vehicle parking spaces shall provide motorcycle parking
                       spaces conveniently located near the main entrance to the primary structure and accessed
                       by the same access aisles that serve the vehicle parking spaces in the parking lot.

                                   A. Number of Spaces Required ­ A minimum of one motorcycle parking space
                                      shall be provided for each 100 vehicle spaces or fraction thereof.

                                   B. Space Dimensions ­ Motorcycle spaces shall have minimum dimensions of
                                      four feet by seven feet.
                       Reduction of Parking Requirements
                       The number of parking spaces required by Table AP above may be reduced or modified
                       through the following measures or any combination of measures.

                              A. Shared Parking ­ Where two or more uses utilizing the same parking have
                                 distinct and different hours of peak parking demand (such as a theater and a
                                 bank), the required minimum number of parking spaces may be reduced by
                                 up to the number of spaces required for the least intensive use.

                              B. Waiver of Parking ­ The Board may reduce or waive the minimum number
                                 of parking spaces required based on quantitative information provided by the
                                 Applicant that documents the need for fewer spaces (e.g. sales receipts,
                                 documentation of customer frequency, information on parking standards
                                 required for the proposed land use by other cities, etc.).

                              C. Waiver of Parking: Off-Hour Uses ­ The Board may reduce or waive the
                                 minimum number of parking spaces required for a land use that has a peak
                                 parking demand that does not coincide with the general peak parking
                                 demand (generally considered the evening peak period).

                              D. Waiver of Parking: Transportation Demand Management ­ The Board may
                                 reduce or waive the minimum number of parking spaces required based on
                                 quantitative information provided by the Applicant that documents a
                                 reduction in parking demand from transportation demand management
                                 measures.

                              E. Phased Development, Temporary and Off-site Parking ­ Due to the lengthy
                                 buildout time period expected for Woodmont Commons, future sites of
                                 buildings may be graded and prepared for use as temporary shared parking
                                 areas. Any such temporary parking areas that are assigned to earlier phases of
                                 development in Woodmont Commons may substitute for future structured
                                 or other parking as may be designated, assigned and shown to the Board by
                                 the Applicant. This provision is specifically intended to allow early and
                                 especially smaller phases of development to have smaller amounts and even
                                 no off-street parking areas on the developed parcel.
                              F.   Buildout Ratios/Park-Once ­ In Use Zones W-2-1 and W-2-2, as well as in
                                   any future areas of similar character, uses will change over time and parking
                                   shall not be required to be updated for every change of use provided: the
                                   overall parking ratio is in the range of 2.2 or more spaces per thousand
                                   square feet of commercial GLA; the residential density does not exceed 15
                                   units/acre; parking is shared; and no use is more than 1,500 feet from a
                                   shared off-street parking facility. The purpose of this is to encourage the
                                   establishment of future "park-once" areas where patrons and others arriving
                                   by vehicle will park one time and then walk amongst many uses.
                       Bicycle Parking
                       Each multi-family residential use and all nonresidential uses are encouraged to provide
                       bicycle parking in compliance with this section. The Board may waive any bicycle-
                       related provision herein.

                              A. Bicycle Parking Standards ­ Bicycle parking should be designed for both
                                 short-term and long-term needs. The bicycle parking requirement may be
                                 met on site or may be exempted based on nearby shared facilities.

                                   1. Short-Term Parking is intended for bicycle trips where bicycles will be
                                      left for a short time period (generally less than 2 hours). It requires a
                                      high degree of convenience and should be located as close to
                                      destinations as possible.

                                   2. Long-Term Parking is intended for bicycle trips where bicycles will be
                                      left for a longer periods of time (generally for several hours, overnight,
                                      or seasonally). Long-term bicycle parking is intended to serve the needs
                                      of commuters and residents, but not retail patrons.

                              B. Number of Bicycle Spaces ­ A reasonable number of bicycle parking spaces
                                 should be provided based on the nature of the proposal at hand and the
                                 number of automobile parking spaces required for the use.

                       Parking Design Standards
                                A. On-Site Parking and Access to Parking

                                        1. Except in Use Zones W-2-1-GL and E-2-1, surface parking lots shall
                                           generally not abut any streets other than alleys and should generally be
                                           located behind buildings.

                                        2. Except in Use Zones W-2-1-GL and E-2-1, parking, including parking
                                           garages, should generally be accessed from an alley or secondary
                                           frontage when practical.

                                        3. Pedestrian entrances to all parking lots and parking garages should be
                                           directly accessible from the sidewalk.

                                B. Access to Adjacent Sites ­ Adjacent off-street parking areas on adjacent
                                   properties are encouraged to have vehicle connections to provide for
                                   convenience, safety, and efficient circulation. Shared pedestrian access
                                   between adjacent properties is also strongly encouraged.

                                C. Parking Space and Lot Dimensions ­ Parking lots and stalls should be
                                   designed with the following ranges of dimensions.

                                D. Off-Site Parking ­ All projects may locate required parking away from the
                                   site of the proposed use.

                                        1. Location of Parking ­ Permanent off-site parking should be located
                                           within 600 feet of residential uses and within 1,200 feet of non-
                                           residential uses if on parking lots or within 1,500 feet of a shared
                                           parking garage for any use, unless otherwise approved by the Board.

                                        2. Evaluation of Proposal ­ In considering a request for off-site parking at
                                           distances greater than those above, the Board may consider whether
                                           adequate provisions, such as shuttle service, adequate pedestrian
                                           facilities and street crossings, have been provided to bring people from
                                           the parking to the site.

                                   3. Guarantee of Continued Availability ­ Long-term required parking
                                      spaces that are off-site may be committed by a recordable lease, deed, or
                                      other easement agreement, acceptable to the Town, and which shall run
                                      with the land.

                              E. Tandem Parking ­ Tandem parking (vehicles parked front bumper to back
                                 bumper) is permissible in private parking lots, areas or garages where all
                                 tandem parking is attendant directed on a full-time, year-round basis.
                                 Vehicles may be parked in tandem where the parking area is serving a single
                                 dwelling (including dwellings in multiple-family developments when both
                                 tandem spaces are assigned to the same unit) and where the tandem parking
                                 is not more than two cars in depth. The Board may grant approval of
                                 tandem parking for nonresidential developments if the Applicant
                                 demonstrates that it will not interfere with orderly parking and movement of
                                 vehicles.

                                   1. The Board may also approve mechanical parking lifts when an
                                      attendant or valet parking agreement is provided. Proposals for
                                      mechanical parking lifts shall be on a case-by-case basis to assess their
                                      functionality and safety.

                              F. Maintenance ­ All permanent off-street parking spaces and driveway areas
                                 shall be paved and maintained for the duration of the use requiring such
                                 areas. Snow and ice should be removed promptly from all required off-street
                                 parking and driveway areas. Temporary parking areas may be paved or have a
                                 crushed gravel or equivalent surface.

                              G. Landscaping ­ Parking lots may be landscaped in compliance with the
                                 following guidelines.

                                   1. Amount of Landscaping ­ Except for parking lots within the interior of
                                      blocks, where no landscaping is required, each parking lot shall provide
                                      landscaping within and/or around the parking lot at a minimum ratio
                                      of 5 percent of the gross area of the parking lot.

                                   2. Location of Landscaping ­ Where required, landscaping shall be evenly
                                      dispersed throughout each parking lot. Orchard-style planting
                                      (placement of trees in uniformly-spaced rows) is encouraged for larger
                                      parking areas.

                              H. Snow Storage

                                   1. On-site snow storage will not generally be required, and snow removal
                                      will be considered a collective effort of the Project except in perimeter,
                                      single-family residential lots where homeowners and tenants will be
                                      responsible for snow removal.

                                         2. No snow storage is required where the Applicant provides means of
                                            melting the snow using underground heating elements or other, similar,
                                            means of removing the snow.
                       Loading Spaces
                       Shared on-street loading areas are permitted and encouraged in the denser parts of the
                       Project, in particular Use Zones W-2-1, W-2-2 and W-2-10 and any other areas of
                       similar character.

                       Off-street loading spaces are encouraged. The Board may modify these guidelines, where
                       it is determined that the operating, shipping, and delivery characteristics of the use do
                       not require the number or type of loading spaces required by this section, or that
                       adequate shared on-street loading spaces are provided.

                                 A. Number of Loading Spaces ­ Off-street loading spaces guidelines are as
                                      follows. Guidelines for uses not listed shall be determined by the Board based
                                      upon the guidelines for comparable uses. Loading zones in mixed-use areas
                                      shall be shared.

                                 B. Standards for Off-street Loading Areas ­ Off-street loading areas should be
                                    sized as follows:

                                         1. Dimensions ­ Loading spaces should be 8 to12 feet in width, 20 to 40
                                            feet in length, with 10 to 14 feet of vertical clearance.

                                         2. Location ­ Loading spaces should be:

                                                   a) As near as possible to the main structure and limited to the rear
                                                      two-thirds of the parcel, if feasible;

                                             c) Any off-street loading areas shall allow vehicles to enter from
                                                and exit to a public street in a forward motion only; and
                                             d) Situated to avoid adverse impacts upon neighboring
                                                residential properties.

                                   3. Loading Ramps ­ Plans for loading ramps or truck wells shall be
                                      accompanied by a profile drawing showing the ramp, ramp transitions,
                                      and overhead clearances.

                                   4. Striping

                       Specific Requirement: Summary of proposed traffic impact, including preliminary estimates of
                       trip generation, trip distribution and potential areas of off-site transportation improvements.
                       The most current edition of the ITE's Trip Generation shall be used as a starting point
                       for trip generation calculations for traffic analysis purposes. However, since mixed-use
                       walkable neighborhoods such as the Project produce fewer trips than do the same land
                       uses if assembled in a "suburban" fashion, the Applicant will reference the best available
                       data to calculate an internal "capture" rate to account for: walking trips; bicycling trips;
                       transit use, telecommuting and the like. The capture calculations will incorporate the
                       existing and proposed land uses, and percentage of trips "captured" is anticipated to
                       increase over time so that areas like W-2-1 may approach a 50% capture rate. Also see
                       TND 8-10 on pages 48-51.

                       An online case study can be found at the following site:

                       for additional traffic data.

                       Vehicle Trip Generation and Distribution

                       The site-generated traffic volumes were estimated based on trip rates obtained from the
                       Institute of Transportation Engineers publication Trip Generation, 8th Edition for the
                       following Land Use Codes:

                           ·    LUC 110 ­ Light Industrial
                           ·    LUC 270 ­ Planned Unit Development
                           ·    LUC 310 ­ Hotel
                           ·    LUC 610 ­ Hospital
                           ·    LUC 710 ­ General Office Building
                           ·    LUC 820 ­ Shopping Center

                       It is reasonable to expect that many trips to the PUD will be shared between multiple
                       land uses within the PUD. For example, someone living in the residences may choose to
                       shop at the retail or eat at the restaurants within the PUD. Therefore, a reduction in the
                       overall trips experienced on the adjacent roadways can be anticipated as a result of multi-
                       use trips that include stops at more than one use within the PUD. The trip estimates
                       were quantified for each individual use and then adjusted for the percentage of trips that
                       are expected to stay inside the boundaries of the project as an element of "internal
                       capture." The internal capture rates were obtained from empirical data and analysis for
                       other mixed-use developments similar to the proposed PUD. A copy of the extensive
                       research associated with the shared trip characteristics, as summarized by TND
                       Engineering, and other trip generation worksheets are provided in Appendices 7 and 8.

                       Many of the retail and restaurant trips generated by the proposed PUD are already
                       present in the existing traffic flow passing by the PUD. For example, some vehicles
                       which are already on the roadways may decide to visit the PUD on their way to another
                       destination. These vehicle trips are known as "pass-by" trips and are subtracted from the
                       total trips to calculate the total primary (or "new") trips that affect the volume of traffic
                       within the study area away from the PUD. Based on information contained in the ITE
                       publication Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition, approximately 26 to 34 percent of
                       the traffic generated by the proposed retail portion of the PUD is expected to be pass-by
                       traffic.

                       The distribution of site-generated traffic volumes from residential land uses was based on
                       U.S. Census journey-to-work information for residents living within the Town of
                       Londonderry. The distribution of site-generated traffic volumes from office uses was
                       based on journey-to-work information for employees working in the Town of
                       Londonderry. The distribution of site-generated traffic volumes from retail uses was
                       based on a gravity model, which contains information on population in surrounding
                       towns, competing opportunities, and travel time to/from the PUD. A series of detailed
                       worksheets to document the expected trip distribution characteristics are provided in
                       Appendix 8. The resulting trip distribution percentages are graphically depicted in TND
                       13 on page 52 and TND 14 on page 53 for the retail, office, and residential land uses
                       respectively. The site-generated traffic-volume networks are presented in TND 9A and
                       9B on pages 50-51. Vehicle trip distributions can be found on TND 15-17 on pages 54-
                       56.

                       Off-Site Traffic Considerations
                       The newly generated traffic from the Project will be mitigated through an array of public
                       and private investments in roadway and transit infrastructure in areas surrounding the
                       site. The Town of Londonderry and NHDOT have proposed several short- and long-
                       term improvement projects associated with their corridor studies and prior impact fee
                       assessments. These projects include Route 93 Exit 4, Route 102 Upper and Central
                       Corridor Improvements, and reconfiguration of Pillsbury Road / Gilcreast Road.

                       Certain improvements may be necessary to safely and efficiently accommodate traffic in
                       the future full-build scenario. As various phases are proposed during the Site Plan
                       Review process, the Applicant's team will prepare detailed traffic studies in general
                       conformance with the Town's or State's standards. Each study will define the existing
                       conditions and the mix of existing and proposed land uses, analyze shared trip credits
                       and the impacts of the newly generated external vehicle trips, and propose any necessary
                       project-related mitigation or the Project's relationship to previously established Town or
                       State capital improvement projects.

                       The following is a brief summary of the area projects that may be necessary to
                       accommodate new vehicle trips from the Project:

                           ·   New Garden Lane Connector Road ­ This project assumes a new north-south
                               roadway connection between Garden Lane and Pillsbury Road, through
                               property currently owned by DSM and Pillsbury Realty Development, LLC.
                               The roadway is expected to be a mix of 4-lane and 5-lane cross-sections, with
                               two general purpose lanes and occasional auxiliary turn lanes. It will transition
                               in character as it moves from the W-2-1-GL zone into the dense village core of
                               the W-2-1 zone, where on-street parking will be introduced.
                               This new section of roadway may include one or more roundabouts to provide
                               definition to access points for major land uses and traffic calming features at the
                               gateways to the Project. It may also consider a new east-west connection of
                               Garden Lane, near the current VIP Auto Parts, to provide additional space for
                               queuing between Route 102 and the first major roadway or driveway
                               intersection. The feasibility of this realignment will be contingent on
                               reconfiguration of property lines, relocation of stormwater facilities, and various
                               cross-access agreements.
                           ·   Nashua Road (Route 102) / Garden Lane ­ This intersection may require an
                               additional lane on Garden Lane southbound as it approaches Route 102. This
                               will allow the traffic movements to operate within their own lane. It may also
                               include additional widening work consistent with the Town's Route 102
                               Central Corridor Improvements.
                           ·   Nashua Road (Route 102) / Gilcreast Road ­ This intersection may require the
                               construction of an additional left-turn lane on both Route 102 eastbound and
                               Gilcreast Road southbound. Other improvements should be advanced by the
                               Town as part of the Route 102 Central Corridor Improvements.

                           ·   Nashua Road (Route 102) / Londonderry Road / St. Charles Street ­ Route
                               102, east of the Route 93 interchange, will be widened by NHDOT as part of
                               the pending interchange improvements. This same section of roadway is part of
                               the Town's Route 102 Upper Corridor Improvements. The improvements
                               should consider separate left- and right-turn lanes on Londonderry Road
                               southbound and potential signalization.
                           ·   Ash Street / Londonderry Road ­ This intersection will be partially
                               reconstructed as part of NHDOT's pending widening work and bridge
                               reconstruction along Route 93. This work should consider auxiliary turn lanes
                               on Ash Street and accommodate a future fourth leg of the intersection as part of
                               the Project. Future traffic studies may examine the warranting condition for the
                               installation of a traffic signal.
                           ·   Ash Street Extension / North High Street ­ Motorists traveling east on Ash
                               Street Extension currently experience peak-hour delays attempting to turn left.
                               The proposed Exit 4A interchange is expected to significantly reduce traffic on
                               Ash Street Extension. Future traffic studies may examine whether a change in
                               intersection alignment or traffic control is warranted based on the expected
                               redistribution of traffic associated with Exit 4A and new traffic associated with
                               the Project.
                           ·   Pillsbury Road / Gilcreast Road / Hardy Road ­ This cluster of intersections has
                               been the subject of several prior traffic studies by the Town and nearby private
                               developers. The Town previously collected impact fees to address a long-term
                               improvement for additional turn lanes and modifications to the traffic control.
                               As part of traffic studies during the Site Plan Review process, the Applicant will
                               analyze the appropriateness of the Town's established plans and may consider
                               alternative alignments of the roadways to accommodate future growth and new
                               connections to the Project, Route 102, and Londonderry Road.
                           ·   Pillsbury Road (through Project) ­ The horizontal and vertical alignment of
                               Pillsbury Road through the Project may be modified to accommodate the new
                               Connector Road from Garden Lane and other new roadways that are expected
                               to extend further to the north. The design of Pillsbury Road in this area should
                               consider auxiliary turn lanes, where warranted, as well as pedestrian and bicycle
                               facilities. This roadway, once improved, is expected to remain a publicly-owned
                               and maintained facility.

                                    1. Separation of Parking Costs ­ All off-street parking spaces for
                                       new multi-family projects, or in future new conversions of multi-
                                       family projects, may be leased or sold separately from the rental
                                       or purchase fees for the life of the units if approved by the Board
                                       through the permitting process, such that potential renters or
                                       buyers have the option of renting or buying at a price lower than

                                       would be the case if there were a single price for both the unit and
                                       the parking space.
                              B. Commute Trip Reduction ­ The following requirements may be applied to
                                 all new commercial projects:

                                               and submit a trip reduction plan to reduce work-related vehicle
                                               trips from the number of trips related to the project as
                                               indicated in the most current edition of the Trip Generation

                                            b) Any combination of the following methods may be
                                               incorporated into trip reduction plans to achieve the required

                       Specific Requirement: Proposed open space areas.
                       The Project will have a variety of Open Spaces that remain natural as well as other open
                       spaces that may be planted or developed in the form of parks, squares, open water and
                       Greens. Green and Open Space requirements shall be considered for the entirety of the
                       Project, not individual parcels. Also see TND 1 on page 13.

                       11. Natural and Cultural Resources (2.8.9.2.11)

                       Specific Requirement: Natural and cultural resources proposed to be preserved.
                       The Project has few stone walls within the Woodmont Commons Project area. Some
                       open space areas may be considered as natural resources and buffers. See TND 1 on page
                       13.

                       12. Buffers (2.8.9.2.12)

                       Specific Requirement: Proposed buffers, if appropriate, to adjoining property.
                       In certain areas, such as along Gilcreast Road, some apple trees will be used as a
                       vegetation buffer. Elsewhere around the site a buffer of at least 50' will be preserved from
                       adjacent residential properties. Please see TND 18 on page 61.

                       13. Landscaping (2.8.9.2.13)

                       Specific Requirement: Sketch/plan of proposed landscaping.
                       The landscaping within the PUD will be consistent with the purposes and all applicable
                       regulations for the open space and buffer areas described in 10. Open Space (2.8.9.2.10)
                       and 12. Buffers (2.8.9.2.12). Please see TND 19 on page 64.

                       The landscaping along the streets and travelled ways that will compose the PUD will be
                       consistent with the general characterization of trees, landscaped medians, margins and
                       setbacks indicated in Appendix 3 Woodmont Commons Streets Specifications and
                       Palette.

                       Landscaping within parking areas will be consistent with Town of Londonderry
                       standards, unless alternate landscape approaches are proposed by the developer and
                       deemed to provide the same or better levels of aesthetic and environmental value by the
                       Londonderry site plan Permit Granting Authority.

                       Street trees shall be planted within the street Right-of-Way generally and approximately
                       as are illustrated in the Woodmont Commons Streets Specifications and Palette in
                       Appendix 3. However, street trees may be shifted or eliminated along any street section
                       as long as the number trees equals an average spacing of fifty (50) feet on center. Trees
                       shall not be required along sides of streets abutting tree preservation areas or parks where
                       internal trees are planted and visible from the street.

                       In addition, landscaping will be governed by the following principles:

                           ·   Landscaping may be laid out in formal rows or informal drifts.
                           ·   Plant material located within 20 feet of any road or other paved area will
                               generally consist of species which are tolerant of roadway deicing salts and
                               otherwise planted and maintained so as to maintain a pleasing public realm.
                           ·   Landscaping shall be designed so that it does not substantially interfere with
                               vehicular or pedestrian sight distances as to create a public safety hazard.

                       14. Water and Sewer Systems (2.8.9.2.14)

                       Specific Requirement: Brief explanation or sketch of proposed water and sewer/septic systems.
                       All potable water and sewage disposal systems shall be provided by either Manchester
                       Water Works, Derry Municipal Water, or Pennichuck Water (or equivalent) and
                       municipal sewer systems determined by the Board to be reasonably consistent with the
                       capacity of the Town's water and sewer infrastructure. All parcels and dwellings in the
                       Project shall be serviced by public water and sewer.

                       Woodmont Commons is a large project that is expected to be built out over several
                       decades. The Applicant will be making very significant and substantial investments in
                       infrastructure and developmental improvements throughout the development of the
                       Project. In order to estimate the amounts of water to be consumed and sewage flows to
                       be disposed for each phase of development, the Environmental Protection Agency's
                       publication EPA 625/R-00/008-Chapter 3 is incorporated by reference as general
                       information in support of this section.

                       The calculations for water consumption and sewage disposal are to be considered equal
                       for planning purposes and at standard rates used by the New Hampshire Department of
                       Environmental Services (NHDES).

                       The Board shall receive estimates of proposed flows for uses not listed by the NHDES,
                       and for populations, customers, seats and the like if based on data from similar projects
                       and uses. In later phases of the Project, metered flows from earlier phases of the Project
                       shall be accepted as demonstrative of sewer and water use for similar uses.

                       The Applicant shall not be granted any certificate of occupancy for buildings which, if
                       occupied, would exceed the capacity of the public water supply or sewage disposal
                       systems. However there shall be no restriction on the number of units or amount of
                       development that may receive Master Plan approval from the Board based on water
                       supply or sewage disposal capacities of the available facilities. Public water supply and
                       sewage disposal remain required parts of the Project.

                       Water Supply
                       Based on discussions with Manchester Water Works (MWW), who manages the source
                       of potable water for the project area, there is adequate capacity to accommodate the
                       proposed development.

                       With the 2006 upgrades to the MWW facilities, the water treatment plant has the
                       capacity to treat up to 40 million gallons per day (MGD) of high-quality water. The
                       treatment facility has a current average demand of approximately 17.5 MGD with high-
                       use days reaching 28 to 29 MGD. This results in significant reserve capacity. Based on
                       their distribution maps, the Woodmont Commons project lies within the franchise area
                       controlled by Pennichuck Water Works, who distributes water using a supply that
                       Manchester Water Works provides along Route 28, Old Derry Road, Wilson Road, and

                       other locations in Londonderry. The source of MWW's water is Lake Massabesic in
                       Manchester and has a "safe yield" of 20.5 MGD.

                       The southeasterly limit of MWW's infrastructure terminates along Route 28 at the
                       Londonderry/Derry town line, but also extends along Coteville Road in Londonderry
                       near the town line. South of there, the infrastructure is controlled by the Town of Derry.
                       There are several potential locations to connect to the Woodmont Commons project
                       through an extension of the Pennichuck Water Works and Town of Derry
                       infrastructure. See Appendix 9 for a copy of the recent correspondence from MWW.

                       Project team members also discussed the project with representatives of Pennichuck
                       Water Works (PWW), who maintains water mains along Route 102, Garden Lane, and
                       Gilcreast Road on the southerly and westerly edges of the PUD. As part of the
                       infrastructure planning for the project, project team members will continue to meet with
                       PWW to identify water line loops, booster stations, and reserve water tower needs. As
                       part of the broader public benefit of the PUD proposal, the Proponent will investigate
                       the feasibility of providing a water loop between the east and west sides of Interstate 93
                       as an element of flexibility for regional access to the water supply.

                       As each phase of the project is proposed, the water line network will be configured to
                       create redundancy in the event of a failed line. Water gates will be positioned at each leg
                       of intersections and key loops through development pads in order to isolate sections of
                       pipe for maintenance. During each phase of site plan review, and as part of calculable
                       needs that may be identified by specific tenants, the Proponent will commission a study
                       of the water distribution system. In the event that the system requires additional storage
                       to better distribute the water demand for the project over a typical day, or requires
                       additional improvements to the hydraulic grade line (water pressure), the Proponent will
                       consider a water tower near the northerly end of the site where the elevation is the
                       highest.

                       Wastewater Capacity
                       There is adequate reserve capacity to treat wastewater that is generated by the PUD. The
                       project team coordinated with the Town of Derry Wastewater Department to better
                       understand the capacity of the Derry Wastewater Treatment Plant, located southeast of
                       the I-93 Exit 4 Interchange. The wastewater treatment facility currently has capacity to
                       treat 3.0 million gallons per day (MGD) based on the current lagoon operations,
                       treatment methods, and permits. The treatment capacity can extend to 4.0 MGD with
                       the use of one of the supplemental lagoons at the treatment facility. The treatment
                       facility has a current average demand of approximately only 1.6 to 1.8 MGD, which
                       results in significant reserve capacity. The balance of the treatment capacity is
                       apportioned on a first-come, first-serve basis. See Appendix 9 for a copy of the recent
                       correspondence from The Town of Derry Department of Public Works.

                       The treatment of flows from the Town of Londonderry falls under an existing
                       intermunicipal agreement between the two towns. Derry's facility currently treats
                       approximately 80,000 to 100,000 gallons per day, or 0.08 to 0.10 MGD, from the

                       Town of Londonderry. The Proponent will work with the two towns as specific phases
                       of the project are proposed. A new agreement will be required with the Town of
                       Londonderry if the demand from Londonderry exceeds the current cap.

                       Due to the topography of the PUD site on both sides of Interstate 93, the sanitary sewer
                       flows are likely going to be conveyed by gravity in primary interceptors from north to
                       south. There may be portions of the development on the east side of Interstate 93 that
                       will require force mains to connect to existing facilities along Londonderry Road or
                       Route 28. Any low lying residences or businesses will have private pumps to discharge
                       their wastewater into the trunk lines. However, these are expected to be limited in
                       number and will be identified in each particular phase.

                       Most of the wastewater from the west side of Interstate 93 will be conveyed to the low
                       point in the system along Charleston Avenue and pumped to the other side of the
                       highway to the wastewater treatment plant. As part of the first phase of the PUD, the
                       Proponent will evaluate the capacity of the Gilcreast Road and Charleston Avenue
                       piping network to identify any short- and long-term improvements that may be
                       necessary to upsize the pipes to accommodate the additional flow from the PUD. Most
                       of the wastewater on the east side of Interstate 93 will be conveyed by gravity in existing
                       and proposed pipes along Ash Street and Londonderry Road, with a lesser volume
                       expected to be pumped from the A Street pump station, which lies to the east of the
                       PUD in the existing industrial park.

                       15. Stormwater Management Plan (2.8.9.2.15)

                       Specific Requirement: Brief explanation or sketch of proposed stormwater management plan.
                       The overall stormwater management plan is to provide on-site detention and retention
                       so that the rate of stormwater flow leaving the Project post development is equivalent to,
                       or less than, the stormwater presently leaving the Project. The proposed pond area on
                       W-2-3 will, if constructed as now conceived, form a part of this stormwater management
                       strategy.

                       The Project shall provide for proper surface drainage so that conveyance of surface
                       waters will not adversely affect neighboring properties or the public storm water system
                       and will help prevent flooding, erosion and sedimentation.

                       The Project's drainage systems shall be designed so that the post development runoff rate
                       outside the Project does not exceed the pre-development runoff rate.
                       Detention/retention areas may be used to achieve this requirement. Underground
                       detention structures are permitted in the Project.

                       Surface water runoff shall be carried away in a system of swales, drainage ways, culverts
                       and channels to a natural watercourse or existing drainage facilities, as the same are
                       regulated by the State of New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services.

                       Where a site is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream serving
                       another property or properties, an easement may be provided ensuring the ongoing use
                       and maintenance of such watercourse.

                       All culverts or other drainage facilities shall at least be large enough to accommodate 25-
                       year design storms.

                           ·   Design Computations ­ A drainage study shall be submitted for review in
                               connection with Site Plan Review, unless a proposal will have de minimis or no
                               drainage impact. A drainage study shall include the same items in the Town's
                               Site Plan Review Regulations, Section 3.07.
                           ·   Driveway Culverts ­ The location, length, size, material, bedding and backfill of
                               any driveway culverts proposed for an existing Town road shall be approved by
                               the Town prior to construction. The Applicant's engineers shall design all
                               proposed driveway and other culverts in the Project.

                       Hydrologic Analysis
                       The hydrology of the project site will be analyzed at a primary discharge point such as
                       the pond located at the southwesterly project limit. The pre-development and post-
                       development conditions will be analyzed so that the post-development discharge rate
                       does not exceed the pre-development discharge rate to the greatest extent possible.
                       Watershed area plans will be provided to depict the pre-development and post-
                       development runoff areas for the project site. Watershed soil characteristics will be
                       determined in accordance with the Soil Conservation Service. The hydrologic analysis

                       will be designed for the 50-year storm event and all calculations will be provided in an
                       acceptable format to the Town Engineer.

                       Hydraulic Analysis
                       The hydraulics of the project site will be analyzed for all open channels, swales, cross
                       culverts and closed drainage systems to check the capacity of a 25-year storm event. All
                       capacity analysis will be performed in accordance with The Manual on Drainage for
                       Highways ­ NH Department of Transportation. The hydraulic analysis calculations shall
                       be provided and summarized for each element of the drainage system in an acceptable
                       format to the Town Engineer.

                       Stormwater Management Facilities
                       The overall objectives of the stormwater management plan are to control, convey, and
                       treat stormwater to improve the quality of runoff and prevent downstream flooding and
                       erosion and sedimentation. The stormwater management plan will utilize a mix of Low
                       Impact Design (LID) and convention stormwater best management practices (BMPs) to
                       achieve the objectives of the plan. Examples of LID BMPs may include bioretention/rain
                       garden areas, water quality swales, vegetated buffer strips, tree box filters, or other
                       treatment facilities designed to mimic the natural stormwater treatment and filtration
                       process. Examples of conventional BMPs may include sediment forebays,
                       detention/retention basins, water quality units, underground detention/infiltration
                       chambers, and deep sump hooded catch basins. Stormwater Management Facilities will
                       be designed to treat runoff and reduce peak runoff rates from the pre-development
                       condition. Stormwater Management Facilities will be sized in accordance with Town
                       and State standards. The proposed pond area on W-2-3 will, if constructed, form a part
                       of this stormwater management strategy.

                       Chloride Abatement Plan
                       In 2008 the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services published a Total
                       Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) study for chlorides for watershed in the I-93 Corridor
                       including the Beaver Brook Watershed. The TMDL estimated that more than 90% of
                       the chloride loads in the Beaver Brook watershed and in adjacent watersheds derived
                       from road salt usage for deicing of roadways and parking areas. In the Beaver Brook
                       Watershed approximately 47% of the chloride loads were attributable to deicing
                       activities in private parking lots and 46% could be attributed to deicing of roadways.

                       In response to these findings Woodmont Commons will cooperate with the Towns of
                       Londonderry and Derry and the State of New Hampshire to continue source reduction
                       best management practices as defined in the New Hampshire Department of
                       Transportation's TMDL Chloride Implementation Plan.

                       These practices include:

                           ·   Calibrated Applicators
                           ·   Brining Applicators
                           ·   Pre-Wetted Applicators
                           ·   Ground Orientated Applicators
                           ·   Proactive Anti-icing Practices

                       In addition, Woodmont Commons will also explore additional source reduction and
                       chloride abatement practices where applicable for common parking areas and sidewalks.
                       These practices may include geothermal hydronic assist for large areas such as parking
                       lots or boiler assist hydronic and embedded electric radiant snow melt systems for
                       sidewalks and common areas.

                       In problem sidewalk and common area locations where persistent icing hazards require
                       the use of deicing agents, such as cold pockets, northern exposures, and persistent fetch
                       areas, Woodmont Commons may consider incorporating chloride bioremediation
                       species into rain garden areas.

                       16. Other Proposed Utilities (2.8.9.2.16)

                       Specific Requirement: Brief explanation or sketch of other proposed utilities.
                       The Project is expected to include, without limitation, cable television,
                       telecommunications lines, gas, and electrical power lines, and other traditional utilities.
                       In addition, there may also co-generation facilities that may provide means of melting
                       snow and ice using buried heating lines of various types or other methods available
                       under streets, sidewalks, and parking areas.

                       All utilities shall generally be located underground and at any location within street and
                       alley Rights-of-Way that is consistent with state or national public health safety
                       requirements. Utilities are also permitted underground elsewhere within easements.

                       All utility outlets, service entrances, transformers and the like shall be clustered, where
                       practicable, to mitigate visual impacts and screen equipment from view where permitted
                       by Building and Electrical codes.

                       Lighting
                       Outdoor lighting in the Project shall consist primarily of pedestrian-scale Streetlights.

                       Significant public or civic buildings may be illuminated with spotlights.

                       Commercial and mixed-use buildings may have building-mounted lights directed to the
                       ground to "wash" parts of the building with light.

                       Building-mounted lighting on porches, garages and the like is also expected to augment
                       the lighting in the Project.

                       Lighting shall be consistent with the intent of the Master Plan.

                       Wireless Communication
                       Wireless communication systems and apparatus are permitted in E-1. It is the
                       Applicant's intent to preserve the existing wireless facilities located on E-1, and no
                       setbacks from these facilities shall apply.

                       17. Firefighting Strategy (2.8.9.2.17)

                       Specific Requirement: Brief explanation or sketch of proposed firefighting strategy.
                       Most of the larger buildings in the Project will have sprinkler systems, either wet or dry.
                       In addition, hydrants will be well-positioned and located throughout the Project to
                       provide firefighting access to credible sources of fire-fighting water.

                       It is also anticipated that as the Project reaches future, near build-out conditions, that
                       some firefighting apparatus may be located on site- on either or both sides of Route 93.

                       As each phase of the project is proposed, the water line network will be configured to
                       create redundancy in the event of a failed line. Water gates will be positioned at each leg
                       of intersections and key loops through development pads in order to isolate sections of
                       pipe for maintenance. During each phase of site plan review, and as part of calculable
                       needs that may be identified by specific tenants, the Proponent will commission a study
                       of the water distribution system. In the event that the system requires additional storage
                       to better distribute the water demand for the project over a typical day, or requires
                       additional improvements to the hydraulic grade line (water pressure) for fire flow, the
                       Proponent will consider constructing a water tower near the northerly end of the site
                       where the elevation is the highest. Fire hydrants will be located with reference to the
                       National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) guidelines and will consultation with the
                       Londonderry and Derry Fire Departments as a site plan is prepared for each phase of the
                       PUD.

                       18. Architecture (2.8.9.2.18)

                       Specific Requirement: Proposed architectural        standards   or   guidelines   or   brief
                       explanation/sketch of architectural treatment.
                       Woodmont Commons is intended to emulate the good characteristics of traditional and
                       walkable New England communities. The Applicant submits that an attempt to prepare
                       arithmetic or geometric or other strict definitions of style would be unduly complicated
                       and counterproductive.

                       For that reason, and because of the power of images to communicate a great deal of
                       information, the images contained throughout this document together with the
                       following images are intended to convey the styles of private buildings to be constructed.
                       Civic buildings should convey their purpose and civic nature as a part of the structure's
                       design.

                       Note that some images depict overhead wires, which are not generally considered to be a
                       part of the Project.

                       The following images depicting architectural guidelines and building massing do not
                       pertain to Use Zones W-2-1-GL or E-1 and are intended to convey general building and
                       structure styles that are otherwise considered to be in keeping with Applicant's vision for
                       Woodmont Commons. All images convey at least one if not several desirable
                       characteristics including but not limited to:

                           1.      Proportion
                           2.      Scale

                           5.      Roof Lines
                           6.      Exterior cladding
                           7.      Placement of windows and doors
                           8.      Eaves and/or overhangs
                           9.      Historical Reference
                           10.     Window types
                           11.     Horizontal and vertical change in materials
                           12.     Relationship to the public environment
                           13.     Outdoor spaces
                           14.     Recesses

                       19. Signage (2.8.9.2.19)

                       Specific Requirement: A "Signage Plan" shall be submitted, this document shall establish
                       guidelines regulating and coordinating all signage within the PUD, including general
                       representations of tenant signage, development signage, directional signage, and vehicular and
                       pedestrian traffic circulation signage. Specific criteria for design, size, proposed sign types
                       (wall, free standing, etc.), materials, heights, colors, setbacks, projections and contextual issues
                       shall be established. Any other sign design information as required by the Town shall also be
                       provided.
                       The following parameters pertain to the installation, use, maintenance, and lighting
                       standards of signs within and relating to commercial and mixed-use areas within the
                       Project. Signage within the Project's residential Use Areas will be subject to section 3.11
                       of the Londonderry Zoning Ordinance, unless such section conflicts with the Master
                       Plan, in which case the Master Plan provisions shall prevail.

                       The Signage Plan is provided in Appendix 4.

                       20. Phasing and Amenity Approach (2.8.9.2.20)

APPENDIX 1: DEFINITIONS



                       Words and phrases within the Master Plan shall have ordinary dictionary meanings
                       except as may be otherwise defined hereafter. The general definitions of the
                       Londonderry Zoning Ordinance shall pertain to Woodmont Commons unless otherwise
                       defined herein.

                       Accessory Apartment: (Also known as "granny flats," guest apartments, in-law
                       apartments, family apartments or secondary units and units over a garage) provide
                       supplementary housing that can be integrated into single family and other
                       neighborhoods to provide a typically lower priced housing alternative with little or no
                       negative impact on the character of the neighborhood. Because the units are usually
                       small, they are more affordable than full-size rentals. There are three types of accessory
                       units:

                           1. Interior ­ using an interior part of a dwelling;
                           2. Interior with modifications where the outside of the dwelling is modified to
                              accommodate a separate unit (this could include a unit over the garage if the
                              garage is attached)
                           3. Detached ­ a structure on a residential lot that is separate from the main
                              dwelling, yet by definition still "accessory" and so smaller than the Principal
                              unit.

                       Agriculture: Shall mean any operations of a farm such as the cultivation, conserving, and
                       tillage of the soil, dairying, greenhouse operations, the production, cultivation, growing
                       and harvesting of any agricultural, floricultural, sod or horticultural commodities, the
                       raising of livestock, bees, fur-bearing animals, fresh water fish or poultry, or any practices
                       on the farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations including,
                       but not necessarily restricted to, the following: preparation for market, delivery to
                       storage or to market, or to carriers for transportation to market, or any products or
                       materials from the farm; the transportation to the farm of supplies and materials; the
                       transportation of farm workers; forestry or lumbering operations; the marketing or
                       selling at wholesale or retail or in any other manner any products from the farm and of
                       other supplies that do not exceed in average yearly dollar volume the value of products
                       from such farm.

                       Applicant: Pillsbury Realty Development, Inc., HYRAX Derry Partners LLC, Demoulas
                       Supermarkets Inc., and Robert D. and Stephen R. Lievens or their legally authorized
                       agents.

                       Assisted Living Facility: A facility licensed under RSA 151 for elderly (over 55 years of
                       age) or disabled individuals, which provides onsite services that support independent or
                       semi-independent living for residents, including, at a minimum, communal dining
                       facilities, and may include onsite personal care services, housekeeping and linen service

                           ·   Signs are used to establish a) identities of tenants, b) to contribute to a lively
                               visual atmosphere, and c) to give clear functional information. Graphic signs
                               should be simple and clear and reinforce the character of the subject business
                               and overall character of the PUD.
                           ·   Materials, colors, placement and shape must be clearly differentiated from
                               public safety, traffic and regulatory signage.

                       said tract acquired through foreclosure, trustee's sale or otherwise.

                                18.      The Protective Covenants set forth herein are made for the benefit of
                       the owners of Lots within the Subdivision and/or their designees. All persons having an
                       interest in these Protective Covenants have the right to stop or prevent the violation of
                       these Protective Covenants by seeking injunctive relief, restraining orders, or availing
                       themselves of other lawful process.

                               19.      The Grantor and its business successors reserve the right to itself, its
                       agents, employees, contractors and subcontractors, to enter upon the Lots and land
                       covered by these Protective Covenants for the purpose of carrying out and completing
                       the development of the Subdivision, and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass,
                       conversion or other actionable wrong.

                               20.     Invalidation of any of these Protective Covenants by a court of
                       competent jurisdiction shall in no way affect or invalidate any of the other restrictions
                       which shall remain in full force and effect.

                                21.      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a majority
                       of the owners of the Lots within the Subdivision and/or their designees shall have the
                       right, but not the obligation, to waive any of the Protective Covenants contained herein.
                       A decision to waive any of these Protective Covenants shall be an isolated determination
                       and shall not in any way invalidate any of the other Protective Covenants which shall
                       remain in full force and effect.

                                 22.   These Protective Covenants are subject to all encumbrances of public
                       record.

Re: Woodmont Commons Trip Capture

Dear Mike:

As you know, I requested that TEC Engineering use internal "capture" rates of 35% for
the full buildout of Woodmont Commons east of Route 93 and 45% for the westerly
portion. These rates were applied as reductions to the traffic predicted using the
Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) publication Trip Generation. These rates are,
in my experience and judgment, quite conservative.

Trip "capture" is a term of art relating to a trip which does not enter or exit a project in a
motor vehicle. These trips do not occur due to: replacement by a walking or bicycling
trip; the trip is made by vehicle but the vehicle does not exit the project; the trip does not
occur at all,
such as a
home-based
work trip; or
the trip is
made          by
transit. The
largest factor
is usually by
walking. The
graphic        to
the right was
prepared by
the      Florida
DOT            to
explain the
concept,
especially for
an      internal
driving trip.

As you know, I have worked on the design and analysis of dozens of projects in the US
and abroad that share characteristics with Woodmont Commons. I have been studying
and witnessing the effects of trip capture for years and have attached a few documents
in support of the above capture rates for Woodmont Commons.

First, and both the oldest and most local, is a report of a study of Portsmouth I prepared
in 1991 when I owned White Mountain Survey Co. For this study, we cordoned off the
downtown and an adjacent residential area and measured traffic into and out of the
areas, and then compared these results with what the ITE methodology would predict.
This analysis showed a daily capture rate of more than 50% and even higher peak hour
capture rates.

Next is an article by professor Robert Cervero, where he notes on page 2 that research
for trip generation calculation purposes, "[t]he co-mingling of offices, shops, eateries,
and condos within a master-planned project" can reduce vehicle trips "by as much as
55%".

I have also attached an April 10, 2007 letter that I prepared for a project proposed in
South Carolina named Noisette. In this case, there was a lot more detail known of the
project land use mix (or at least what was thought to be known in 2007), so I worked
with SCDOT and Kimley-Horn (a large engineering firm) to calculate trip capture in more
detail, and as may be seen on the first page, daily capture came in at almost 48%;
SCDOT actually thought we were low.

There is additional literature available, but for the Master Planning purposes of
Woodmont Commons, I trust that this package will be found to be adequate.

                                                    Sincerely,
                                                    TND Engineering

Re: Noisette Trip Generation & Capture

Dear Larry:

I have been working on a refinement of my earlier calculations regarding the vehicular
trip generation and capture rates for the Navy Yard at Noisette.

My first series of calculations built largely on my own cordon count study of Portsmouth,
NH. First, I have updated those calculations to reflect the Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 7th Edition comparison rates. These calculations
revealed an overall daily capture rate of 47.7%, up a little from the 41.8% based on the
earlier edition Trip Generation formulas.

AM and PM overall peak hour capture rates decreased a little, from 72.3% to 67.7% and
from 64.6% to 64.0%, respectively.

I have also used the City of San Diego's City Centre trip generation rates for additional
information and comparisons. This information provides several use-by-use rates,
which help augment the Portsmouth data, which was necessarily an overall blend of
capture for all of the uses. Since the San Diego data does not have peak hour data, I
have looked at both Trip Generation comparisons of daily and peak hourly rates and the
Portsmouth ratios.

I first calculated the "base" trip generation rates for the Navy Yard on a phase-by-phase
basis for the weekday peak hourly periods and on a daily basis. These revised land
uses correspond to the latest and final information from Harry Gordon, FIA and Gina
Baker of Burt Hill. I should note that this information revised the overall residential unit
count to the lower value of 5,610 units to correspond with the approved PDD. These
use mix values also now correspond with Burt Hill's revit model of Phase One that
caused a revision to the prior calculations.

These calculations appear on the following pages.

    In the earlier calculations, I had used what amounted to a series of blended San
    Diego/Portsmouth series of capture rates. I more closely examined the various use
    types and proportions in both the Navy Yard and Portsmouth and, while similar, there
    are differences.

    Portsmouth has a higher percentage of its commercial uses in retail, but a very similar
    proportion of office. Residential densities and numbers are higher in portions of the
    Navy Yard as well.

    Taking this information into account, I re-calculated capture rates on a use-by-use basis
    where I had data to support this methodology. As a check on this method, I then
    analyzed Portsmouth using this same technique. An iterative process ensued and I
    calculated capture rates that allowed the methodology to predict Portsmouth's daily and
    peak hourly trip generation within 10% daily and 15-18% on a peak hourly basis. The
    final rates that I settled on over-predict Portsmouth's trip generation by those amounts
    (in other words, the formulas I used predict higher trip generation than was actually
    counted in the cordon counts).

After calculating these results, I went back and re-examined my earlier methodology,
updating it with the revised Portsmouth data using the 7th Edition of Trip Generation.
These two calculations compared quite favorably. : within 1% of each other on a daily
basis and within 11% and 1% in the AM and PM peak hours respectively.1

As final checks, I have also analyzed the Navy Yard using the California Department of
Transportation's (CalTrans) Urbemis program (available online at www.urbemis.com).

This program is relatively new, but its results are recognized by CalTrans for studies in
California, and I feel it is valid on a comparative basis.

Urbemis does not (to my knowledge) estimate peak hourly traffic volumes, as it is
primarily a vehicular emissions calculator. Using its default settings, and assuming a
daily transit service of 15 stops in or within ¼ mile of the Navy Yard at buildout, Urbemis
calculates a daily trip generation of approximately 82,000 vehicle trips, as compared
with the approximate 86,000 to 90,000 that I calculated using the above-described
methodologies ("raw" data, again yield approximately 137,000).2

I have also revisited the phasing question from a capture perspective. While it remains
true that each phase of the Navy Yard represents a very large project (bigger than most
in total), upon reflection I feel it appropriate to consider that the capture rates will mature
and increase as the project builds out.

I therefore in my judgment have reduced the buildout capture rates to 65% of buildout
values for phase 1 and to 83% for phase 2. Putting these together in summary form
yields the following comparative table:

                                                       Capture Rates Summary
                                                      Daily   AM Peak   PM Peak
                Navy Yard Phase 1                     24%       35%      33%
                Navy Yard Phase 2                     31%       44%      41%
                Navy Yard Buildout                    37%       57%      49%
                Portsmouth Study                      48%       68%      64%


On a phase-by-phase basis, the trip generation distributions appear as follows:


1 Using the prior methodology and a 10% factor of conservatism, the former method calculate results slightly higher
than the more refined method, by the percentages noted; increasing that factor (less capture) increases the difference
from the current methodology.
2 The transit service input does not seem to impact the resultant trips generated in a substantive manner, which does
not seem logical. I have contacted one pf the principals at Nelson/Nygaard, one of the primary authors of the
program to see about this.

  In addition to these calculations, I have reviewed what I believe is all of the current
  literature on this topic of internalization and elimination of trips.

  So that it is contained in this letter, it is clear from my research that vehicular trip
  generation is a well-understood phenomenon when land uses are assembled in a
  suburban form. Indeed, when land uses are separated and linked essentially only by
  thoroughfares, Trip Generation, cited earlier, is a good predictor of vehicular trips
  generated.

  However, the Trip Generation database shows a wide range of trip generation in certain
  land uses; for single family houses, the daily range of rates runs from 4.3 to almost 22
  trips per day per household.

The Appendices in the Urbemis user manual also provide data on the relationship
between density, parking supply and other factors and vehicular travel rates.1

It is clear that the more urban form of land development pattern of the Navy Yard will
generate fewer vehicular trips than would the same land uses assembled in a more
sprawling fashion.

In deriving these "final preliminary" result, I reserve the possible need to change them
pending my review and consideration of the parking supply data that is being or has
been developed by Kimley-Horn.

Based on all of the above, I hereby submit this letter and information, in my opinion as a
professional engineer licensed by the State of South Carolina, as the vehicular trip
generation and trip capture report for the Navy Yard at Noisette.

Mr. Michael Kettenbach
Pillsbury Realty and Development, LLC

Londonderry, NH 03053

Subject: Woodmont Commons Fiscal Impact Analysis

Dear Mr. Kettenbach:

It is our pleasure to submit this proposal to prepare a Fiscal Impact Analysis for Woodmont
Commons, a proposed master planned community on approximately 625 acres in Londonderry,
New Hampshire.

PROJECT UNDERSTANDING

The owners of the Woodmont Commons site are Pillsbury Realty Development, LLC., HYRAX
Derry Partners, LLC, Demoulas Super Markets, Inc. and Robert D. and Stephen R. Lievens
("Owners), and their goal is to create a revenue-positive mixed-use live, work, plan community
using traditional neighborhood development principles that will compliment, blend with and
augment the existing community. Woodmont Commons is intended to constitute a single PUD.
The proposed land uses are as follows:

       New dwelling units ­ up to 1,430 mix of types
       Office building space ­ up to 700,000 square feet
       Medical ­ up to 300 beds or 250,000 square feet
       Hotel ­ up to 3, 50 to 400 guest rooms each, total up to 550
       New retail ­ up to 882,000 square feet

SCOPE OF SERVICES

This section outlines Development Planning & Financing Group's ("DPFG") proposed work
program, including deliverables. DPFG considers this work scope flexible and can adjust to
meet the needs of the Owners.
TASK 1: Meet with Town Staff and Town's Independent Reviewers and Review
Background Materials (Trip #1)

To complete this Task, DPFG will perform the following:

     1. Tour the project site.
     2. Review relevant documents and plans pertaining to the project.
     3. Review the Town's budget, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, Town fee
        ordinances and other financial documents from the Town and affected special districts.
     4. Meet with Town staff and the Town's Independent Reviewers to discuss background
        materials, methodologies, data and assumptions for the Fiscal Impact Analysis.

TASK 2: Fiscal Impact Model Design

In this Task, DPFG will design a fiscal impact model suitable for the Woodmont Commons
Master Plan. The objective of the model is to assist the Owners in measuring the revenue-
positive impacts of the project on the Town of Londonderry. Fiscal neutrality is achieved when a
development pays the full costs of all public facilities and services that are required to support
the development and that are required to meet or exceed the level of service standards adopted by
the Town. Revenue-positive results are achieved when the public revenues generated exceed the
corresponding cost of services. The facilities and services shall include the initial costs of
required Town infrastructure and the on-going costs for operations and maintenance.

The Government Finance Officers Association ("GFOA")1 outlines the most common methods
for estimating service costs in fiscal impact analysis as: average cost, marginal cost,
comparisons to other governments and econometric modeling. In many cases, fiscal impact
analysis uses a combination of these methods to generate a projection.

          Average Cost is the easiest and most common method and assumes the current cost of
          serving residents and businesses will equal the cost of serving the new development. The
          average cost method provides a rough estimate of both direct and indirect costs
          associated with development. However, this method does not account for demographic
          change, existing excess capacity or potential economies of scale in service delivery.
          Methods of calculating average cost include per capita costs, service standard costs and
          proportional valuation costs.

          Marginal Cost uses site-specific information to determine services costs for a new
          development. A case study approach is typically necessary to gather detailed information
          about the existing capacity within public services and infrastructure to accommodate
          growth from a development project. This method assumes that information about local
          service levels and capacity is more accurate than standards based on average data

          Comparable Governments incorporate the experience by similar governments with
          comparable development projects. Studying other governments before and after specific

                                                                                                                                 2
       projects can provide useful information in determining additional costs and the increase
       in costs over a long period of time.

       Econometric Modeling uses complex econometric models and is best used for
       estimating impacts from large projects that create many indirect effects on the existing
       community such as a utility plant or an entertainment center.

The fiscal impact analysis of Woodmont Commons will use a marginal/average cost hybrid
methodology to determine the project's impact on capital and operating costs. Personnel and
operating costs will be projected on a variable, or incremental basis, as will expenditures for
capital improvements. Revenues, such as property taxes, will be projected on a marginal basis
whereas revenues attributable to growth will be reflected on an average basis. A case study
approach will be used for revenue and cost assumptions developed on the marginal basis.

The FY2013 budget will form the basis for the Town's service level, revenue and cost
assumptions. Revenue and costs will be projected in constant 2012 dollars, with no adjustment
for future inflation. The use of a constant dollar approach in fiscal impact analysis produces
annual and buildout results that are readily comparable and understandable.

The Owners will provide estimated absorption rates and projected market values for the project's
residential, commercial and retail products. DPFG's scope of work does not include market
analysis, market feasibility or market valuation services and procedures.

TASK 3: Develop Assumptions and Analyze Fiscal Impacts

DPFG, in collaboration with Town staff and the Town's Independent Reviewers, will gather
appropriate inputs and develop reasonable assumptions for the fiscal analysis using acceptable
fiscal impact methodologies. Fiscal impacts will be presented in 2012 dollars on a net annual
and cumulative basis over the build-out period.

TASK 4: Preparation of Draft Fiscal Impact Analysis and Report

Upon completion of the analysis, DPFG will submit a draft report for review and comment by
the Woodmont Commons team. During this task, DPFG, at the direction of the Owners, may
also solicit comments from Town staff and their Independent Reviewers so any issues or
concerns can be fully resolved prior to finalization of the report.

TASK 5: Finalization of Fiscal Impact Analysis and Report

DPFG will submit the final Fiscal Impact Analysis and Report to the Owners. It is our
understanding the final report is needed within 65 days of the Planning Board meeting to

1.0 Introduction
1.1      Purpose of Report

This Traffic Report is a technical report intended to present findings of the evaluations of
existing and future traffic operations for the Federal Boulevard (5th Avenue to Howard Place)
Planning Environmental Linkage (PEL) Study. The report is organized in the following
sections:
·     Section 1 provides an introduction, with statements about the purpose of the report in
      the PEL development process.
·     Section 2 provides an evaluation of existing traffic operational conditions.
·     Section 3 presents year 2035 traffic forecasts and evaluates operational conditions in
      2035 with the No-Action scenario.
·     Section 4 provides level of service (LOS) evaluations of intersection operations in the
      year 2035 with the Proposed Action scenario.
·     Section 5 provides a summary of results of the traffic study.

The traffic forecasts that are presented and evaluated in this report are Year 2035 forecasts,
using the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) 2035 regional travel demand
forecasting model as a basis.
There are three primary purposes for the preparation of this Traffic Report:
·     It provides an opportunity for stakeholders to review analyses in detail to inform ongoing
      discussions about the PEL improvements.
·     It provides detailed information supporting the PEL traffic analysis beyond what may be
      included in the PEL final report, which is intended to be a more concise summary of
      important traffic analysis results and conclusions.
·     The traffic forecasts and level of service findings presented provide a basis for
      preliminary analyses of other resources, including air quality and noise.

1.2      Additional Traffic Evaluations
Another related technical report that is being developed is the Safety Report. This report
provides an analysis of the accident history in the study area. The results of the Traffic
Report and the Safety Report will be refined and incorporated in the Transportation Impacts
section of the forthcoming PEL.

2.0 Existing Conditions
2.1     Existing Roadway Network
The study area designated for the Federal Boulevard PEL process is depicted on Figure 1.
Federal Boulevard is an arterial roadway with three lanes southbound and two lanes
northbound between 5th Avenue and 10th Avenue, and three lanes southbound and
northbound between 10th Avenue and Holden Place. This section of Federal Boulevard is a
segment of State Highway 88 (SH 88) within the City and County of Denver (CCD). The
study includes the portion of Federal Boulevard between 5th Avenue (MP 1.12) and south of
Howard Place (MP 0.17). This section of SH 88 is designated on the National Highway
System (NHS). The speed limit along this section of Federal Boulevard is 35 mph.

2.2     Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing daily and peak hour traffic volume information is summarized on Figure 2. The
average weekday daily traffic volumes on Federal Boulevard are approximately 40,000
vehicles per day (vpd) between 6th and 8th Avenues and 41,400 vpd between 8th and Colfax
Avenues. These volumes were obtained from the average annual traffic volumes contained
in the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) data base, adjusted up by 6% to
convert to a weekday traffic equivalent based on CDOT data.
Existing peak hour traffic count data were developed from counts taken for the Baseline
Traffic Analysis Report - Existing and 2030 No-Action Conditions report completed in July
2006 for the Environmental Assessment of Federal Boulevard from Alameda to 5th Avenue
and counts performed for this PEL study in August and September 2008.
Traffic count data were evaluated to determine the directional split and percents of daily
traffic occurring during peak hours. The northbound direction experienced 47% of traffic
while the southbound direction experienced 53% of traffic. This disparity is likely due to the
lane difference created by two northbound lanes and three southbound lanes. Percentages
of traffic occurring in the peak hours are approximately 7% and 9% for the AM and PM
hours, respectively. Traffic flows remain heavy over long periods of the day.

2.3     Capacity Analysis
2.3.1 Methodology
The analysis of traffic operations in the study area utilized methods documented in the
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Transportation Research Board, 2000 Edition. The result
of such an analysis is a level of service (LOS) rating, which is a qualitative assessment of
the traffic flow for a given roadway facility. Level of service is described by a letter
designation ranging from "A" to "F", with LOS A representing essentially uninterrupted flow,
and LOS F representing a breakdown of traffic flow and excessive congestion and delay.
For analysis of a signalized intersection, a LOS rating is calculated for an intersection as a
whole. Level of service analysis of an unsignalized intersection yields a LOS rating for each
critical vehicle movement. The Synchro software analysis package and methodology was
utilized to calculate LOS ratings for signalized intersections throughout the study area.
The traffic parameters shown in Table 1 were used as the basis for the operational
analyses. Level of service delay parameters are included in Appendix A.

2.3.2 Public Transportation Services
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) operates several bus routes that service Federal
Boulevard. Federal Boulevard is a heavily used transit corridor. There are four routes that
provide services along Federal Boulevard within this project area: Route 30 South Federal,
30L South Federal Limited, 36L Fort Logan Limited, and 49 North Lowell.
Figure 3 shows the locations of the bus stops and each route that services it in the study
area.
Route 30 South Federal. This route is the primary service provider along Federal
Boulevard and provides all day service between the Wadsworth-Hampden Park-N-Ride and
downtown Denver. Service is provided every 10 minutes in each direction during the peak
hours, every 15 minutes in each direction during the off-peak hours, and every 30 minutes in
each direction during the late-night hours.
Route 30L South Federal Limited. This route provides additional service during both the
AM and PM peak periods between the Wadsworth-Hampden Park-N-Ride and downtown
Denver. Service includes four northbound and one southbound trip during the morning
period, and one northbound and four southbound trips during the evening period.
Route 36L Fort Logan Limited. This route provides additional service during both the AM
and PM peak periods between the Littleton/Downtown Station and downtown Denver.
Service includes six northbound and four southbound trips during the morning period, and
six northbound and nine southbound trips during the evening period.
Route 49 North Lowell. This route provides service during both the AM and PM peak
periods between the Colfax-Federal Transfer Center and 46th Avenue/Wolff Street. Service
includes three northbound and three southbound trips during the morning period, and three
northbound and three southbound trips during the evening period.
The impact of these bus routes on Federal Boulevard traffic was observed during a site visit.
The primary problem occurred when a bus approached a stop and blocked the right lane
along Federal Boulevard causing all traffic behind also to stop. Many cars did not wait until
the bus started again, but instead abruptly turned into the adjacent lane. This problem is
most pronounced in the northbound direction where there are only two lanes and it was
harder for vehicles to avoid the bus blocked lane. The effect of bus stops along the corridor
was included in the Synchro modeling for all analyses.

3.0 Assessment of Future Conditions
3.1      Traffic Forecasting
Year 2035 traffic volumes on Federal Boulevard were forecasted using the regional travel
demand model developed by DRCOG. Traffic forecasts were first prepared based on a No-
Action scenario, with the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan background roadway network
in place. Chapter 4.0 presents the same travel demand levels reallocated to represent the
Proposed Action.

3.1.1 Forecasting Process
DRCOG, as the Metropolitan Planning Organization for Denver, is responsible for
development of regional transportation plans and travel demand forecasting models for the
metropolitan area. The most current Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG)
regional travel demand model (Compass 2.0, Version 95) was used to prepare year 2035
design year traffic forecasts for the Federal Boulevard corridor.
Daily traffic forecasts were developed first by taking model-produced volumes and adjusting
them based on the differences between actual traffic counts and base year (2005) model-
produced volumes. The adjustment process followed the National Cooperative Highway
Research Project publication number 255 (NCHRP 255), per DRCOG recommendations.
The adjusted daily traffic forecasts were compared with existing traffic volumes to develop
generalized growth projections, which generally range from 20% to 40% growth between
today and 2035. These growth rates were applied to existing peak hour turning movement
counts to generate 2035 forecasted peak hour turning movements.

3.1.2 Baseline Roadway Network
The baseline Year 2035 traffic forecast scenario presented in this report uses the current
fiscally constrained 2035 Regional Transportation Plan roadway network. In addition to the
numerous roadway improvements throughout the region that are included, the baseline Year
2035 roadway network includes the following improvements within the Federal Boulevard
PEL study area and its immediate vicinity.
·     The Year 2035 analysis includes a major US 6 interchange reconfiguration. The new
      configuration provides a standard diamond configuration, with the entrance ramp onto
      Eastbound US 6 at the southern intersection with Federal Boulevard and US 6. The new
      traffic patterns associated with the rerouting of traffic through the intersection were taken
      from the Valley Highway EIS.
·     To remain consistent with previous forecasting processes and due to limitations in the
      modeling process for unbalanced laneage, Federal Boulevard was coded as having six
      through lanes from Jewell Avenue to Colfax Avenue for both the No-Action and
      Proposed Action forecasts.

3.1.3 Traffic Forecasts
Figure 5 depicts the projected Year 2035 No-Action daily and peak hour movements for the
study area. Daily traffic volume forecasts for 2035 are in the 53,000 to 55,000 vpd range on
Federal Boulevard in the study area, with increases of approximately 30% compared with
existing traffic volumes.

3.2     Year 2035 No-Action Capacity Analysis
3.2.1 Level of Service
As with the existing conditions operational assessment, analysis of forecasted Year 2035
traffic operations in the study area utilized methods documented in the HCM. Again, these
forecasts and the operational analyses are based on the adopted Regional Transportation
Plan network. The LOS results are depicted graphically on Figure 6.
The analysis of projected Year 2035 traffic conditions at each of the intersections along
Federal Boulevard reflects a general pattern of worsened operational conditions. Two of the
five analyzed signalized intersections are expected to operate at LOS F during peak hours,
including 10th Avenue/Federal Boulevard with LOS F during the PM peak hour and 8th
Avenue/Federal Boulevard with LOS F during both the AM and PM peak hours. Table 2
summarizes the 2035 No-Action signalized intersection results along with existing
conditions. The average intersection delay calculated by the HCM methodology is shown in
parenthesis for intersections shown to operate at LOS F.
LOS worksheets for the Year 2035 No-Action scenario are included in Appendix C.

4.0 Analysis of Proposed Action Scenario
4.1     Definition of Proposed Action Scenario
The Proposed Action defines the improved Federal Boulevard cross-section. This scenario
represents the expansion of the remaining two-lane northbound portion within the study area
into a full three lanes. Through lanes would be widened to a standard 11 foot width. Two
northbound and southbound left turn lanes are provided at the interchange with US 6 for an
eventual 10 lane overpass at this interchange.
In addition, this scenario removes the existing two way left turn lane and replaces it with a
raised curb median with dedicated left turn lanes. In addition, the access to Severn Place
and Barberry Place would be reduced to right-in-right-out movements with new raised curb
median barriers. Also, the access to 7th Avenue, 11th Avenue, and 12th Avenue were
reduced to ¾ movements, with left-turns permitted from Federal Boulevard onto the cross-
street but not permitted from the cross-street onto Federal Boulevard.
The signal timing was adjusted for the southbound left turn lanes at Holden Place and
northbound and southbound movements at 10th Avenue to include protected/permitted
phasing. The signal timing was adjusted for the northbound and southbound left turn lanes
at 8th Avenue and northbound and southbound movements at 6th Avenue to include
protected only phasing.
The operational analyses of all the intersections were performed assuming a "baseline" set
of lane geometry assumptions. The baseline laneage for each alternative represents an
initial configuration based on preliminary design assumptions.

4.2     Traffic Volume Forecasts
Year 2035 traffic volume forecasts were developed for the Build Out scenario by modifying
the No-Action scenario discussed in Section 3.1 of this report. The changes include
rerouting traffic that is no longer able to make specific movements due to the raised curb
median installation.
As was mentioned earlier, the major reconfiguration of access onto Eastbound US 6 by
including a through movement at the existing off ramp means significant changes to the
existing roadway geometry. Details of this change can be found in the Valley Highway EIS.

4.3     Level of Service Analysis of Proposed Action Scenario
4.3.1 Proposed Action Scenario
Year 2035 peak hour traffic volumes with the Proposed Action are depicted on Figure 7,
2035 Build Out Peak Hour Traffic Volumes.
The AM and PM peak hour LOS results at each intersection with the Proposed Action are
shown graphically in Figure 8 LOS worksheets for the Build Out scenario and are included
in Appendix D. Proposed Action analyses show that the only projected peak hour LOS F
conditions would occur at the 8th Avenue/Federal Boulevard intersection in the PM peak
hour. Other LOS F conditions projected at the 10th Avenue and the 8th Avenue intersections
with the No-Action scenario would be improved by the Proposed Action.

4.3.2 Level of Service Summary
The results of the operational analyses of all the signalized intersections are summarized in
Table 3. Locations projected to operate at LOS F are shown highlighted in orange. The
highlighted cells within the tables allow for some qualitative operational comparisons
between alternatives. For example, a comparison indicates that the Build Out scenario
provides considerable improvement to vehicle delay time at the intersections of Federal
Boulevard with US 6 when compared to the 2035 No-Action scenario.

5.0 Summary
The evaluation of the No-Action scenario described in Section 3.0 as well as the Proposed
Action scenario described in Section 4.0 included a description of operations based on level
of service analyses. Each scenario included the reconfiguration of Eastbound US 6, allowing
for the evaluation of the impacts of each scenario compared to the forecasted conditions for
Year 2035.
This analysis finds significant benefit to operational performance by widening the roadway to
include three lanes in the northbound direction, as already exists for the southbound
direction. The addition of the third northbound lane would be most significant during times
when a bus must stop for boarding or alighting of passengers. By providing drivers an
additional lane, some would avoid the right lane when a bus is ahead, reducing congestion
and quick lane changes throughout the corridor.
Traffic operations and safety will be enhanced by widening existing sub-standard lanes to
standard 11 foot widths. In addition, the installation of a raised curb median throughout the
corridor would help to control access to individual driveways throughout the segment
reducing the potential vehicular conflicts throughout the study corridor.

                                    INTRODUCTION


There is a residential property located at 133 Barry Avenue on Little Torch Key in the
Florida Keys, Monroe County, Florida. The subject site is approximately 5.23 acres and
is located on the north (bay) side of US 1 / Overseas Highway, near Mile Marker 28.5. A
Project Location Map is presented in Figure 1 on the following page.


Little Palm Cottages, LLC is proposing to develop a new residential rental community on
this site. A preliminary site plan for this project is included in Appendix A.


KBP Consulting, Inc. has been retained by the Little Palm Cottages, LLC to conduct a
traffic impact study for this project. This study addresses the anticipated trip generation
characteristics of the project, the current operating conditions of the surrounding roadway
network, project traffic impacts along Overseas Highway / US 1 by mile marker, and site
access.

Existing Land Use and Access
As mentioned previously, the size of the subject site is 5.23 acres. There are currently
three (3) single family homes on the site.      Previously, this site had also contained
45 mobile homes (Lucky's Landing) which were demolished / removed approximately
five (5) years ago. Primary access to this site is provided via three (3) driveways on
Barry Avenue which intersects with Overseas Highway / US 1 approximately 500 feet to
the south.


Proposed Land Use and Access
The proposed development on this site will consist of 48 residential dwelling units in the
form of 24 duplex buildings. These proposed units will be rentals. Two of the existing
single-family homes will be removed and the third single family home shall be reused as
the community center. The community center will contain a clubhouse and management
office. Additional amenities on the site include two (2) swimming pools, and docking
facilities for residents.   Vehicular access to the site shall be provided by two (2)
driveways on Barry Avenue. And, for the purposes of performing this traffic impact
analysis, the project is planned to be completed by the year 2014.

                                EXISTING CONDITIONS


This section of the report addresses the existing roadway network in the study area and
general traffic conditions.

Existing Roadway Network

Overseas Highway / US 1 through the study area is a two-lane principal arterial. The
intersections along Overseas Highway / US 1 at Barry Avenue and at State Road 4A
consist of dedicated right and left-turn lanes.


In order to assess the traffic impacts on the surrounding roadway network, the project
team selected the section of Overseas Highway / US 1 between Barry Avenue and SR 4A
as the study area for this project. Figure 2 on the following page depicts the lane
geometry at each of the key intersections within the project study area.

Existing Traffic Conditions

The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) maintains a traffic count station
within the proximity of the study area.           FDOT Count Station #900108 is located
2,000 feet north of Kemp Channel Bridge which is near Mile Marker 24.                Traffic
volumes recorded over the last (published) five (5) years at this station is summarized in
Table 1.    Traffic volumes collected at Station #900108 indicate that volumes have
generally decreased during the previous five (5) years.         Appendix B contains the
historical traffic data from the FDOT Count Station referenced above.

                                             TRIP GENERATION


The trip generation for this project was determined using the trip generation information
published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation
(9th Edition). Based upon this information, the daily, AM peak hour, and PM peak hour
trip generation rates for the existing and proposed development are as follows:

         Single Family Detached Housing ­ ITE Land Use #210
                   Daily (wt. avg.) Trip Generation Rate:    T = 9.45 (X)
                   where T = number of trips and X = number of dwelling units

                   AM Peak Hour Trip Generation Rate:                T = 0.75 (X) (25% in / 75% out)
                   PM Peak Hour Trip Generation Rate:                T = 1.00 (X) (63% in / 37% out)

         Apartment ­ ITE Land Use #220
                   Daily (wt. avg.) Trip Generation Rate:    T = 6.50 (X)
                   where T = number of trips and X = number of dwelling units

                   AM Peak Hour Trip Generation Rate:                T = 0.51 (X) (20% in / 80% out)
                   PM Peak Hour Trip Generation Rate:                T = 0.62 (X) (65% in / 35% out)

Table 2 below presents the trip generation analysis for the Little Palm Cottages.

As indicated in Table 2, the proposed residential development is anticipated to generate
284 net new daily vehicle trips, 22 net new AM peak hour vehicle trips (4 inbound and
18 outbound), and 27 net new PM peak hour vehicle trips (18 inbound and 9 outbound).
With 312 gross daily trips, a Level 2 traffic study is required per the Monroe County
Traffic Report Guidelines Manual.

                                  TRIP DISTRIBUTION



A trip distribution analysis was performed based on the nearby population areas (as
documented in the Monroe County Traffic Report Guidelines Manual), the existing
transportation network, and the location of the subject project. Most of the project-
related trips are anticipated to access Overseas Highway / US 1.                 Table 3 below
summarizes the anticipated trip distribution for the Little Palm Cottages project.

                            TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS


This section of the report is divided into two parts: 1) link analysis, and 2) Overseas
Highway / US 1 impacts by mile marker.


Link Analysis
The link analysis compares the maximum number of reserve trips on Overseas Highway /
US 1 through the Little Torch Key area (per Monroe County's Level of Service and
Reserve Capacity Table) with the project's traffic impacts. Based upon a 61%/36%/3%
trip distribution, the project will add a maximum of 173 daily trips (61% of additional
daily trips) to Segment Number 9 (Torch). According to Monroe County's Level of
Service and Reserve Capacity Table (see Appendix D), Segment Number 9 has
2,400 trips of reserve capacity. Therefore, Overseas Highway / US 1 through Little
Torch Key has excess capacity to absorb the maximum impacts generated by the Little
Palm Cottages residential project.


US 1 Impacts by Mile Marker
For this project, it was assumed that the maximum trip length will be approximately
30 miles to the south (toward Key West) and 30 miles to the north (toward Marathon).
The average trip length was assumed to be half of the maximum trip length, or 15 miles.
Based upon these trip length assumptions, the Overseas Highway / US 1 segments
identified in Monroe County's Traffic Report Guidelines, and the traffic assignment
discussed previously, an estimate of the number of primary trips by segment on Overseas
Highway / US 1 was performed. Table 4 summarizes the number of primary trips by
segment on Overseas Highway / US 1 (Arterial Trip Assignment). As indicated in this
table, this project will add approximately 284 daily trips.

                            SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS



Based upon the results of the analyses performed for Little Palm Cottages, the proposed
residential project will not have an adverse impact on the operating characteristics of
Overseas Highway / US 1, nor will it inhibit the safe flow of traffic traveling through
Little Torch Key. Overseas Highway / US 1 has adequate capacity to accommodate the
traffic impacts generated by the project.

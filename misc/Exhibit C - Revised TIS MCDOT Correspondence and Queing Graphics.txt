ATTN:    Thomas J. Cesario, P.E.                    RE:    Wegmans East Avenue ­Traffic Impact
                                                           Study Review, City of Rochester

Dear Mr. Cesario,

Thank you for reviewing our Revised Traffic Impact Study (TIS) dated November 2010 and our
letter dated November 16, 2010. The following is our responses to your letter dated January 12,
2011. Changes will be made to the Traffic Impact Study based on your comments.

Comment 1:     REGARDING THE CAPACITY ANALYSIS SUMMARY SHOWN ON PAGE 12 OF THE UPDATED REPORT,
               THE TABULAR INFORMATION IS INCOMPLETE FOR OUR COMPARISON. PLEASE ADD PROJECTED
               LEVELS OF SERVICE/DELAY DATA USING THE EXISTING TIMING SCHEMES TO PROVIDE
               COMPARISON AGAINST THE INFORMATION USING ADJUSTED TIMINGS.

Response 1:    An updated LOS table, including 2012 Future with Original Timings, is attached
               to this letter.

Comment 2A: FOR EAST AVENUE, WE GENERALLY CONCUR WITH YOUR FINDINGS THAT A TRAFFIC SIGNAL IS
            JUSTIFIED AT THE PROPOSED WEGMANS/COUNTRY CLUB PLAZA INTERSECTION. WE DO
            REQUEST THE ANALYSIS BE RE-RUN WITH THE NON-CONFLICTING RIGHT TURN VOLUMES < 7
               SECONDS REMOVED AND ALSO TO RUN A WARRANT ANALYSIS TO JUSTIFY AN EASTBOUND LEFT
               TURN ARROW.

Response 2A: An updated signal warrant analysis was conducted with the southbound non-
             conflicting right turn volumes <7 seconds removed at the proposed intersection
             of Wegmans Driveway and East Ave. This total number was calculated based on
             the 8.5 second delay per vehicle in the right-turn lane as reported in Sim Traffic
             for the unsignalized intersection during PM peak hour. Using a normal
             distribution curve, the total number of vehicles predicted to experience 7
             seconds of delay or less were identified and removed from the total right turn
             volume. With approximately 96 vehicles removed from the approach, the
             intersection still meets warrants 1b, 2 and 3, and warrants a traffic signal. The
             updated warrant analyses are attached to this letter.

               A left turn arrow warrant analysis was conducted. Though the warrant was not
               met, the total Annual Daily Traffic (ADT) calculated for the warrant is near the
               threshold of 50,000 vehicles. It is expected that the warrant would be met
               within 7 years. Therefore, a left turn phase is still recommended. Additionally, a
               left turn phase will improve the eastbound left turn level of service and reduce
               the eastbound queue lengths in the left-turn lane so the Probert Street

               intersection will not be blocked by traffic turning into Wegmans. The left-turn
               warrant is attached to this letter.

Comment 2B: FOR EAST AVENUE, PLEASE CLARIFY WHETHER A TWO-PHASE SIGNAL OR THREE-PHASE SIGNAL
            IS PROPOSED AT WEGMANS DRIVE/EAST AVE/COUNTRY CLUB PLAZA INTERSECTION. THE
            UPDATED STUDY AND THE NOVEMBER 16, 20 10 DATED RESPONSE LETTER DIFFER ON THE
            DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SIGNAL.

Response 2B: A three-phase signal is recommended. The analysis for the `Signal @ Wegmans'
             has been updated with the 3-phase signal analysis as reported in the November
             16, 2010 response letter. See the attached LOS table for updated levels of
             service.

Comment 2C: FOR EAST AVENUE, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHAT IMPACT EASTBOUND QUEUING AT THE
            PROPOSED SIGNAL LOCATION WILL HAVE ON THE PROBERT STREET INTERSECTION AND THE
            MCDONALD'S ENTRANCE. YOUR PLAN INDICATES ANY QUEUING BEYOND 115 FEET FROM THE
            PROPOSED STOP BAR AT WEGMANS DR/EAST AVE/COUNTRY CLUB PLAZA INTERSECTION WILL
            ENCROACH INTO THE INTERSECTION, YET THE REPORT INDICATES A GREATER LENGTH OCCURS
            BUT DOES NOT MENTION IMPACTS.

Response 2C: With the proposed three-phase signal at Wegman's Driveway/East Ave/Country
             Club Plaza, the eastbound left-turn lane 95th percentile queue length is
             projected to be less than 115 feet for both the PM and Saturday midday peak
             hours. The 95th percentile queue length for the through movement is projected
             to be less than 115 feet for the PM peak hour and approximately 127 feet for
             the Saturday midday peak hour. For cases where there is more than one lane in
             a lane group, the 95th percentile length is reported for the highest lane.
             Additionally, the lane utilization factor for a through lane group movement is
             0.95 which is calculated as the total number of lanes in the lane group
             multiplied by the highest lane volume divided into the total through movement
             volume. Because the reported 95th queue pertains to the highest lane within the
             lane group, the 95th percentile queue for the second through lane would be less
             than 115 feet during the Saturday midday peak hour and is therefore not
             anticipated to block Probert Street or the McDonald's exit. Additionally, the 95th
             percentile queue may never actually be experienced within the peak hour.
             Figure PQ-1 (attached) identifies the proposed 95th percentile traffic queuing
             within the vicinity of Wegmans' including the eastbound approach at the
             proposed signalized intersection at Wegman's Driveway/East Ave/Country Club
             Plaza.

Comment 2D: ALSO, REGARDING WESTBOUND TRAVEL, YOUR 11.16.10 RESPONSE TO OUR COMMENT 1A
               STATED A SINGLE THROUGH LANE WOULD OPERATE SUFFICIENTLY AND THE PRESENCE OF A
               RIGHT-TURN LANE WOULD PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO THE PROPOSED SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION.
               PLEASE EXPOUND UPON THE PREVIOUS REPLY BY STATING YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE
               PAVEMENT MARKING SCHEME THROUGH THIS AREA.

Response 2D: Two westbound lanes are existing, and no changes are proposed or
             recommended. The intersection will operate significantly better if two lanes are
             available. The statement only implies that a majority of the curb-lane traffic will
             be right-turning traffic into the site. Pavement markings should indicate two
             through lanes.

MCDOT Traffic Comments
January 11, 2011

Comment 2E: FOR EAST AVENUE, THE ANALYSIS INDICATES A SINGLE OUTBOUND LANE FOR THE COUNTRY
            CLUB PLAZA ENTRANCE, YET THE PLAN SHOWS TWO EXITING LANES. PLEASE REVISE THE
            ANALYSIS TO COINCIDE WITH THE PROPOSED PLANS. THIS MAY HELP THE QUEUING EASTBOUND.

Response 2E: The Synchro analysis at the intersection of East Avenue and Wegman's
             proposed driveway reflects a single northbound left/through/right lane, and a
             southbound left/through lane, and southbound exclusive-right lane. The
             proposed plans will show this layout.

Comment 3A: FOR UNIVERSITY AVENUE, PLEASE RE-RUN THE ANALYSIS FOR THE PROPOSED SIGNALIZED
            INTERSECTION AT WEGMANS DR/UNIVERSITY AVE TO INCLUDE A LONGER (120-SEC.) CYCLE.
            WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROJECTED EASTBOUND QUEUE LENGTH AND ITS IMPACT ON
            THE PROBERT STREET INTERSECTION. BEFORE CONSIDERING A SECOND EASTBOUND LANE,
            THE LONGER CYCLE LENGTH MAY PROVIDE ADEQUATE MITIGATION.

Response 3A: The Synchro analysis has been updated with 120 second cycle length at this
             intersection, as it decreases the weekday morning and Friday evening peak hour
             westbound through queue lengths. An updates LOS table is attached to this
             letter.

Comment 3B: FOR UNIVERSITY AVENUE, WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED STRIPING PLAN FOR
            UNIVERSITY AVENUE BETWEEN WINTON ROAD AND PROBERT STREET. THE PROPOSED TAPER
            LENGTH TO MERGE 2 WESTBOUND LANES INTO ONE LANE IS ONLY 150' AS THEY LEAVE
            WINTON ROAD. WE FEEL THIS MAY NOT BE ENOUGH SPACE, AND MAY CAUSE SOME PROBLEMS
            AT THE WINTON RD/UNIVERSITY AVE SIGNAL. PLEASE INVESTIGATE OPTIONS TO CARRY TWO
               LANES WESTBOUND FURTHER WEST AND A LONGER TAPER INTO ONE LANE FOR THE PROPOSED
               SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION.

Response 3B: Wegmans has prepared revised striping layout drawings of University Avenue
             which lengthens the westbound 2-lane section and extends the transition to 200
             feet. The western end of the transition is near to the Wegmans' driveway left -
             turn lane. Problems associated with the 2-lane to 1-lane transition are not
             anticipated, since the peak through traffic volumes are half of the single lane
             capacity. The revised plan that shows the proposed striping plan is attached.

Comment 3C: FOR THE WINTON ROAD ACCESS, THE REPORT DOES NOT PROVIDE DISCUSSION RELATIVE TO
            OUR OCTOBER 21, 2010 MEETING. AT THAT TIME, WE DISCUSSED THE ANTICIPATED TRUCK
            DELIVERY SCHEDULES AND THE TOPIC OF THE RAISED MEDIAN CHANGES. THE CURRENT
            PROPOSAL IS TO REMOVE A PORTION OF THE EXISTING RAISED MEDIAN. WE REQUEST A LIST OF
            MITIGATION CHOICES THAT WEGMANS CAN IMPLEMENT SHOULD A PROBLEM EVER DEVELOP
            WITH LEFT TURNS INTO AND OUT OF THIS ACCESS.

Response 3C: It is proposed to remove a portion of the existing raised median on Winton Road
             to allow for truck access. Should a problem arise with left turns into and out of
             this access, the following are options for mitigation:
                      Educate delivery truck drivers on alternate routes to the loading area
                      that do not include a southbound left turn on Winton Road or a left turn
                      exit from the loading area, or access from the Culver Road direction.
                      Limit delivery hours to non-peak hours.
                      Add signage that restricts left turn movements in and out of the site.

Jim, after our phone conversation, we concur with the location you propose for the temporary
pedestrian signal (Harris) as long as it doesn't preclude Wegmans from modifying the location in
the future to better fit the proposed Wegmans site driveway.

We also concur that we would rather not signalize our existing (driveway) onto University Avenue
to accommodate the temporary pedestrian crosswalk at this time.

Eric,

In developing our proposal, we had moved the crosswalk as far west as possible to get it away from your
existing driveway and avoid the conflict problems you've mentioned. We are not planning on installing it
as you show it on your attached plan. I've attached a modified version of it showing where our signal
would go and where I understood that your driveway would go. My understanding was that you were
limited on how far east you could move your future driveway, which was another reason we went this
route. Maybe that's not the case?

If we leave the crosswalk where it is today, we (actually, you) would have to signalize your driveway now
as well as the crosswalk. Is this what you are contemplating? If the final driveway alignment is then
flipped to the other side of the crosswalk, basically you would be starting over for the permanent signal
installation, so you won't gain anything by signalizing your driveway today. You have very few left turns
out as it is.

Alternatively, if you want your future driveway where you have shown it and we relocate the signalized
crosswalk as proposed, the crosswalk would end up on the west leg of your new driveway. I'd rather it be
on the east leg, because then pedestrians coming from the north side wouldn't have to cross your driveway
after crossing University Avenue. (You do show it on the east leg on your drawing, but the crosswalk has
been retained in its existing location). If you were building the store right now, that would be a great
solution, but we need to do something in the interim. Again, we're trying not to signalize your existing
driveway, which is why we're moving the crosswalk away from it.

Call me at 753-7755 if you want to discuss this some more...

Jim

Eric,

I like the proposal to leave the crosswalk where it currently is as shown in your attached preliminary plan.
 This takes a "leg" out of the potential conflicts for pedestrians. I would propose, however, to move the
existing catch basin currently located along the south side of University to the west so it's not located
within the crosswalk. I also propose that the catch basin currently within the crosswalk on the north side
of University Avenue also be moved west. Who would ultimately move these basins and pay for their
relocation would need to be agreed upon, but it seems like it would probably be a City shared expense.

I also attached a copy of the boundary survey as well for MCDOT's reference given if we leave the
crosswalk where it is it won't be necessary to install new ramps. It's up to MCDOT if they still want to
install a temporary pedestrian signal at the crosswalk.

Thanks.

Willy

Subject: University Ave. Temporary signal

Willy, attached is our preliminary plan for the new parking lot. Under a temporary signal
scenario, we are concerned about the potential safety of the Harris pedestrian / vehicle
conflict with our left turn exits (west bound) onto University Ave.

We are also concerned as to whether our west bound exiting traffic will be able to exit
with vehicle stacking on University Avenue (West Bound).

Please keep us in the loop as this further develops

I'll send over the existing conditions plan under separate heading.

Thanks, looking forward to working with you on this.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Wegmans Food Markets, Inc. is proposing to replace the existing supermarket on the north
side of East Avenue between Probert Street and North Winton Road in the City of Rochester.
The existing 40,500 square foot Wegmans store will be replaced by a new 93,500 square
foot store on the same site and on the adjacent land to the east. The traffic was analyzed for
a building size up to 105,100 square feet.

This store location is one of the better performing stores, on a patron volume basis, and is in
need of expansion to remain competitive in the marketplace. In anticipation of required site
plan approval considerations, this Traffic Impact Study was conducted to assess the
potential for impacts to the adjacent street network as well as investigate the interactions
between the proposed site and the motor vehicles, pedestrians, and RTS buses using the
public right-of-ways adjacent to the site.

Manual counts were originally conducted during the months of January and February 2004
to assess operating characteristics. To update this study, new manual counts at the
intersection of East Avenue and Probert Street, and East Avenue and North Winton Road
were conducted in September 2009 to analyze the change in volumes since 2004. This
information was input into a computer based traffic model (Synchro 7.0) to develop a
baseline scenario for comparison purposes. This information was combined with the
proposed site plan from Wegmans to develop a series of models created to assess the
projected future traffic conditions in the vicinity of the site. An updated pedestrian
observation was conducted in October 2010, to observe pedestrian traffic along the East
Avenue corridor.

Overall, the increase in traffic as a result of this application will be modest and may result in
only minor increases in delay at certain locations. Further, the projected increases in delay
can be mitigated by adjusting signal timings where needed.

Significant improvements are being recommended as part of this application, all of which
will have a positive impact on the site and adjacent street networks. These improvements
include:

               Relocating the existing Wegmans driveways on East Avenue and University
               Avenue as shown in the site plan (Appendix `A') and eliminating all access
               points to Probert Street. Resulting in a reduction of the overall number of curb
               cuts from 10 full access points to 2 full-access driveways and 3 limited-access
               driveways.

               on University Avenue; affectively narrowing the travel lanes for the through
               movements in front of the Wegmans Food Market and the Harris Corporation
               buildings.


Based on the analysis conducted, which assessed the projected traffic volumes resulting
from the proposed project, the proposed 93,500 SF Wegmans Food Market will not
adversely impact the adjacent street network and will positively impact the pedestrian and
vehicular environments on the adjacent streets.

This report has been updated based on several changes in site plan design. The following
lists changes made and their effects on the overall traffic impact statement.

    For the original 2004 study, a 105,100 sf Wegmans Food Market with a 4,400 sf
    bank proposed on the southeast corner of the property. This was changed to a
    105,100 sf Wegmans Food Market and a 4,700 sf outparcel for future retail
    development as analyzed in the December 2009 TIS. As of this October 2010 study,
    the site plans have been changed to a 93,500 sf Wegmans Food Market and no
    longer include an outparcel on the southeast corner. Since the total building square
    footage has decreased, the TIS analysis reports volumes for a building size up to
    105,100 sf. Therefore this analysis is conservative.

    The proposed site driveway configuration changed between the December 2009 and
    October 2010 TIS from single exiting lanes to an exclusive right and a left-through
    lane. This slight change improved queue delays at the intersection, reducing the 95%
    queue, and no longer blocking the McDonald's driveway along East Avenue.

I. INTRODUCTION
Wegmans Food Markets, Inc. is proposing to replace the existing supermarket on the north
side of East Avenue between Probert Street and North Winton Road in the City of Rochester.
The existing 40,500 square foot Wegmans store will be replaced by a new 93,500 square
foot store on the same site and on the adjacent land to the east. The total floor area of the
project is approximately 28,800 SF less than the current total floor area on the subject
property.

The purpose of this Traffic Impact Study is to evaluate the potential impacts that the new
Wegmans will have on traffic operations on the adjacent street system. The scope and
parameters used in this study have been reviewed and approved by the Monroe County
Department of Transportation (MCDOT) and reviewed and discussed with the City of
Rochester and the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). The following
general items were included in the original study:

           An inventory of existing roadway and traffic conditions in the vicinity of the project
           site.

           Traffic counts at major intersections surrounding the site.

           A projection of the amount of traffic to be generated by the project and a
           projection of the directional distribution of site traffic on the adjacent highway
           system.

           A signal warrant analysis to determine whether the existing traffic signal at the
           intersection of East Avenue and Probert Street should be removed and replaced
           by a new signal on East Avenue at the new Wegmans driveway.

           A Level of Service analysis for each of the site driveway intersections and for
           nearby existing intersections.

           A review of the recent accident history on existing roadways surrounding the
           project site.

           A review of pedestrian accommodations and travel patterns along University
           Avenue, particularly between the Harris property and the subject site,
           incorporating findings by MCDOT for pedestrian accommodations.

           A review of the current RTS bus operations in the vicinity of the site, to address
           bus stops, staging areas, and potential conflicts with vehicles and pedestrians.

           Identification of mitigation measures to accommodate the new site-generated
           traffic.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The existing Wegmans Food Market is served by one driveway to East Avenue, one driveway
to University Avenue, and two driveways to Probert Street. Additionally there are four
driveways behind the Wegmans Food Market (east of the existing store), two on East Avenue
and two on University Avenue, that access a rear parking lot serving existing retail
establishments and provides employees parking for Wegmans. All driveways are
unsignalized.

Wegmans is now proposing to raze the existing store and construct a new 93,500 square
foot store on the same site and on the adjacent land to the east. An enlarged parking lot
with 356 spaces, versus the existing 213 spaces, will occupy the western portion of the site,
while the new Wegmans building will occupy the eastern portion. Several existing buildings
and a parking garage will be razed to accommodate the new Wegmans store.

The existing Wegmans driveways to East Avenue and University Avenue will each be
relocated some 80 feet to the west. The driveway to East Avenue will be aligned directly
opposite a driveway to the World Gym and Country Club Diner. The World Gym and Country
Club Diner parking lot will be reconfigured to accommodate a shared access to the proposed
signal (see Appendix `A' for intersection details). All existing site access to Probert Street will
be eliminated. As part of the project, Wegmans is seeking the removal of the existing traffic
signal at the intersection of East Avenue and Probert Street and the installation of a new
traffic signal on East Avenue at the Wegmans driveway. The warrants for these traffic
signals are discussed in this report.



                                                                                                 4
Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY          TIS Report Update ­November 2010

A new 121-space underground parking garage will be constructed directly beneath the new
Wegmans building. The parking garage is intended primarily for Wegmans employees, and
will not be accessible to the general public. The garage will be served by two full-access
driveways on University Avenue, one of which will be a one-way entrance and the other a
one-way exit.

The driveway to North Winton Road will be intended for Wegmans service and delivery
vehicles accessing the rear of the Wegmans building.

An updated site plan for the proposed project is shown in Appendix `A'.


III. EXISTING HIGHWAY SYSTEM

The roadway system examined in this study consists of East Avenue from Probert Street to
North Winton Road; University Avenue from Probert Street to North Winton Road; Probert
Street from East Avenue to University Avenue; and North Winton Road from East Avenue to
University Avenue. East Avenue and University Avenue follow a northwest/southeast
orientation and are referred to as east/west streets for study purposes. Probert Street and
North Winton Road follow a northeast/southwest orientation and are referred to as
north/south streets.

All roadways in the study area are on the City of Rochester street system with a posted
speed limit of 30 MPH. There are curbs and sidewalks on both sides of all streets. The
following is a description of the individual streets and intersections in the study area:

East Avenue

East Avenue is a Principal Arterial designated N.Y. Route 96 on the State Touring Route
System. The section of East Avenue from Probert Street to North Winton Road consists of
two 11-foot wide traffic lanes in each direction and an 11-foot wide two-way center lane for
left turning vehicles.

The intersection of East Avenue and Probert Street is signalized. Probert Street is aligned
directly opposite a one-way exit from a McDonalds Restaurant. The East Avenue
approaches to the intersection consist of an exclusive left turn lane and two through lanes,
with right turns made from the outside through lanes. The southbound Probert Street
approach provides sufficient width for one left turn lane and one right turn lane. The
outbound McDonalds driveway consists of one left turn lane and one shared through/right
turn lane.

East Avenue forms a four-way signalized intersection with North Winton Road. The
eastbound, westbound and southbound approaches consist of an exclusive left turn lane
and two through lanes, with right turns made from the outside through lane. The
northbound approach consists of an exclusive left turn lane, two through lanes, and an
exclusive right turn lane. The traffic signal includes green left turn arrow phases for all four
approaches.



                                                                                              5
Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY           TIS Report Update ­November 2010




University Avenue

University Avenue in the vicinity of Probert Street consists of one variable-width traffic lane in
each direction. The roadway widens to two 11-foot wide lanes in each direction about 200
feet east of Probert Street and continues to North Winton Road.

Probert Street intersects University Avenue directly opposite Joe Hues Place. The
intersection is unsignalized with stop signs for the Probert Street and Joe Hues Place
approaches.

University Avenue forms a four-way signalized intersection with North Winton Road. All four
approaches consist of an exclusive left turn lane and two through lanes, with right turns
made from the outside through lane. The traffic signal operation includes advance green
left turn arrows for all four approaches.

Probert Street

Probert Street is a local street that extends for about 325 feet from East Avenue to
University Avenue. Probert Street has a curb-to-curb width of 30 feet and consists of one
traffic lane in each direction with parking permitted along the west curbline.

North Winton Road

North Winton Road between East Avenue and University Avenue consists of two 11-foot wide
through lanes in each direction with exclusive left turn lanes on the respective approaches
to East Avenue and University Avenue.



IV. ROADWAY ALIGNMENT AND SIGHT DISTANCES

All roadways surrounding the project site follow a nearly straight horizontal alignment. East
Avenue, and Probert Street follow a near level vertical alignment; while North Winton Road
drops approximately 14 feet in elevation from East Avenue to University Avenue and
University Avenue drops approximately 10 feet from Probert Street to North Winton Road.
All intersections in the study area form approximately 90-degree angles. The available sight
distances from each of the proposed driveway locations are unrestricted. The available
sight distances exceed the sight distance criteria utilized by the New York State Department
of Transportation for both passenger cars and trucks.

V. EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES

The Monroe County Department of Transportation (MCDOT) reported the following Average
Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes on area roadways as listed below. On East Avenue west of
Winton Road the ADT volumes have dropped between the years 2002 and 2006. Likewise,
on Winton Road north of East Avenue the ADT volumes have dropped between the years
2001 to 2005.

As a part of the TIS Update, TY Lin International [TYLI] (as FRA Engineering) conducted
manual turning movement counts at the following intersections in September 2009:

           East Avenue at Probert Street & McDonalds Driveway (non-Friday Weekday AM,
           Mid-Day, PM, Friday PM and Saturday Mid-day peaks)
           East Avenue at North Winton Road (Friday PM and Saturday Mid-day peaks)

The traffic counts were taken on a weekday morning other than Friday (7:00 AM to 9:00AM),
a weekday mid-day other than Friday (12:00 PM to 1:00 PM), a weekday evening other than
Friday (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM), a Friday evening (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) and a Saturday mid-day
(11:00 AM to 2:00 PM). The traffic volumes recorded at each intersection during the peak
hour periods are illustrated in Figures 1 through 5 in Appendix ,,B.

These counts were compared to the original 2004 counts to determine a growth factor. In
comparison, the volumes appeared to be generally consistent with the 2004 existing
volumes. To determine the Existing 2009 volumes, a seasonal factor was applied to both
the 2004 volumes and the 2009 volumes. These compared volumes were relatively
consistent for the Weekday PM and Friday PM peak hours. However, during the Weekday AM
and Saturday midday peak there was an increase of approximately 15% over the 5 year
period between the 2004 and 2009 counts. A 15% adjustment factor was applied to the
through volumes on East Avenue and North Winton Road, for the Weekday AM and Saturday
midday peak hours for the intersections that were not counted in 2009. Additionally, a


                                                                                         7
Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY          TIS Report Update ­November 2010

seasonal factor was applied to all intersections. Wegmans driveway volumes were not
seasonally factored as the current parking lot is operating at maximum capacity.

For the original TIS Report, TYLI (as FRA Engineering) conducted manual turning movement
counts at the following intersections in February 2004:

           East Avenue at Probert Street & McDonalds Driveway.
           East Avenue at Wegmans Driveway.
           East Avenue at Driveways to Adjacent Businesses (Country Club Diner, Eastside
           Gymnastics, Antique Shop).
           East Avenue at Winton Road.
           Probert Street at Wegmans Driveways.
           University Avenue at Probert Street and Joe Hues Place.
           University Avenue at Wegmans Driveway.
           University Avenue at Driveways to Wegmans Employee Parking and Parking
           Garage.
           University Avenue at North Winton Road.

The original 2004 traffic counts were taken on a weekday morning (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM), a
weekday afternoon other than Friday (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM), a Friday afternoon (4:00 PM to
6:00 PM) and a Saturday (11:00 AM to 2:00 PM).

At the request of MCDOT, this study examined traffic conditions during the weekday
morning, weekday afternoon, Friday afternoon, and Saturday mid-day peak hours.


VI.   PROJECTION OF SITE-GENERATED TRAFFIC

The standard source of trip generation data is the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
Report Trip Generation, 8th Edition. However, the ITE Report does not provide sufficient trip
data for large (80,000+ square foot) supermarkets. Consultants for Wegmans Food
Markets have conducted trip generation studies at a large sample of Wegmans stores in
New York State and Pennsylvania. Their studies have indicated that large Wegmans stores
have different trip characteristics than smaller or mid-size stores.

If the average trip rates obtained at the large Wegmans stores were applied to the proposed
93,500 square foot store on East Avenue, the resulting traffic projections for the new store
would be lower than the actual traffic volumes recorded at the existing 40,500 square foot
store, which is not realistic.

Officials from Wegmans Food Markets anticipate a nominal increase in sales as a result of
the new store footprint. For purposes of projecting traffic, it was estimated that the traffic
generation of the new Wegmans store would be 35% higher than the existing store, which is
conservative. Because of its urban location the trip rates for this store are skewed since
many patrons frequent the store several times per week, often on their way home from
work, versus completing one large shopping trip on the weekends, which is typical of other
store locations. As a result, the calculated trip generation rate for the existing store is 2.85


                                                                                              8
Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY                          TIS Report Update ­November 2010

times higher than that of the average Wegmans Food Market (including 15 or more stores
greater than 90,000 SF in size).

The following table shows the actual trip generation of the existing Wegmans store, the
projected increase in trips resulting from the new Wegmans store:

New Wegmans


Some of the projected trips generated by the new Wegmans are expected to be drawn from
the existing traffic stream passing by the site. These vehicles, referred to as ,,pass-by trips,
represent intermediate stops at the site on the way to another trip destination. Studies
conducted by Wegmans Food Markets indicate that pass-by trips account for an average of
32% of their traffic during the weekday afternoon peak hour and 19% during the Saturday
peak hour. In addition to these rates used for analysis, a 32% pass-by rate was also used
for the Friday PM peak hour and a conservative pass-by rate of 20% was used for the
weekday morning peak hour.

The following table shows the projected trip generation for the Wegmans expansion
according to the number of pass-by trips and primary (new) trips:

VII. TRIP DISTRIBUTION

The projected traffic for the new Wegmans store was distributed to the surrounding highway
system by taking into consideration the existing Wegmans directional patterns and the
surrounding residential and business concentrations. Wegmans officials expect that the
future Wegmans directional patterns should be similar to the existing patterns, except that a
somewhat higher percentage may be anticipated from the south via Winton Road. The
estimated percentage distribution of the new Wegmans expansion traffic on the highway
system is shown in Figure 6 in Appendix ,,B. These percentages apply to the newly
generated traffic and not pass-by traffic. The distribution of pass-by traffic was based on the
directional proportions of existing traffic passing by the site driveways.


                                                                                                                          9
Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY          TIS Report Update ­November 2010


The projected traffic volume distribution of new (primary) trips for the Wegmans expansion is
shown for each of the peak hours in Figures 7 through 10 in Appendix ,,B. The traffic
volumes in these figures do not include existing traffic or pass-by traffic. The estimated
distribution of pass-by traffic is shown in Figures 11 through 14 in Appendix ,,B.

An additional consideration is the redistribution of existing Wegmans traffic to the new
driveways. As noted earlier, the existing driveways to Probert Street will be eliminated and
the driveways to East Avenue and University Avenue will be relocated. The redistributed
existing traffic volumes are shown in Figures 15 through 18 in Appendix ,,B.


VIII.   BACKGROUND AND COMBINED TRAFFIC

The anticipated opening of the new Wegmans store is expected to be Summer 2012. To
account for expected growth in existing traffic over that time period, an annual growth rate
of 0.5% was applied to the through traffic volumes in the study area. The growth rate was
not applied to existing Wegmans traffic.

The resulting volumes were then added to the projected new and pass-by traffic distributions
for the Wegmans. The total volumes, shown in Figures 19 through 22 in Appendix ,,B,
represent anticipated traffic conditions after the new Wegmans project is completed. These
volumes were used to evaluate the proposed site access plan and the potential impacts of
the site-generated traffic.

MCDOT has determined that a signalized pedestrian crossing is warranted for the crossing
located adjacent to the Harris Corporation Building. MCDOT will allow Wegmans to install a
traffic signal at the parking lot driveway on University Avenue concurrent with the pedestrian
crossing. Therefore, all future analysis assumes a traffic signal at the University Avenue
driveway location.


IX. LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS

The critical locations for traffic operations are normally at the intersections of major streets
or driveways. Each of the proposed Wegmans driveways were evaluated for Level of
Service, lane requirements, and signal warrants. In addition, a capacity analysis was
conducted for the following existing intersections to determine the impact of the site-
generated traffic:

           East Avenue at Probert Street & McDonalds Driveway.
           East Avenue at North Winton Road.
           University Avenue at Probert Street.
           University Avenue at North Winton Road.

A capacity analysis was conducted for each intersection by using procedures set forth in the
2000 Highway Capacity Manual, published by the Transportation Research Board. The

purpose of a capacity analysis is to determine the traffic ,,Level of Service for movements
that may be stopped during normal intersection operation. The Highway Capacity Manual
defines the intersection Level of Service in terms of average vehicle delays, ranging from ,,A
for very short delays to ,,F for very long delays. Levels of Service of ,,D or higher are normally
considered to be acceptable for the peak hour periods. The Level of Service definitions are
shown in Appendix ,,C.

All intersections were analyzed by using the Synchro, version 7.0 (Build 761) computer
modeling software. Geometric and traffic control data were based on the Synchro model
utilized by the Monroe County Department of Transportation. The Synchro outputs are
provided in Appendix ,,D,,.

Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY        TIS Report Update ­November 2010

Wegmans Driveway at East Avenue: A capacity analysis was conducted for the intersection
of East Avenue and the new Wegmans driveway for both unsignalized and signalized control.
The unsignalized analysis indicated that left turns from the new Wegmans driveway would
operate at Level of Service ,,F during the weekday PM, Friday PM and Saturday peak hours.
Delays to outbound left turns would be very long due to the relatively high outbound left turn
volume, the amount of conflicting through traffic on East Avenue, and the significant number
of left turns from East Avenue into the driveway (see the proposed queue diagram PQ-1 in
Appendix ,,B. The left turns from East Avenue receive gap priority and utilize many of the
available gaps in the East Avenue traffic stream.

A signalized capacity analysis indicates that all movements at the intersection would operate
at acceptable Levels of Service with a two-phase traffic signal. Signal faces and vehicle
detection should be provided for the new Wegmans driveway as well as the opposing
Country Club Diner driveway. The Wegmans driveway will operate acceptably with one
inbound lane and one outbound lane; however, two exiting lanes (one exclusive right-turn
and one shared left-through) would reduce onsite queue lengths (see Section X ­ Signal
Warrant Analysis).

Probert Street at East Avenue: A capacity analysis was conducted for the intersection of
East Avenue and Probert Street based on a stop sign control on the Probert Street approach.
The analysis for projected traffic indicates that the stop sign-controlled Probert Street
approach would operate at acceptable Levels of Service during all peak hours. However, left
turns from the McDonalds driveway opposite Probert Street would operate at deficient
Levels of Service during the weekday PM peak hour without the existing signal. The left turn
volume from the McDonalds driveway is very low at only 17 and 19 vehicles during the
weekday PM and Friday PM peak hours, respectively. The delays to driveway traffic would
stem from the relatively heavy through traffic volume on East Avenue and not from the minor
left turn volume on the driveway. Traffic from Probert Street and from the McDonalds
driveway will benefit from gaps in the East Avenue traffic stream created by the new signal
at the Wegmans driveway. The analysis indicates that there will be more than sufficient
gaps in the traffic stream to accommodate the outbound traffic (see Section XI ­ Gap
Analysis). Also, under the future conditions, there would be fewer vehicles turning from
Probert Street onto East Avenue, thus reducing the competition for utilizing the gaps in the
East Avenue traffic flow.

A queuing analysis was conducted to determine whether eastbound queues on East Avenue
would extend from the new Wegmans traffic signal into the Probert Street intersection. The
Synchro analysis indicates that during the Friday PM peak hour and the Saturday midday
peak hour the 95th-percentile queue length on East Avenue would be 87 feet and 127 feet
respectively. The periodic queues on East Avenue are not expected to extend to the Probert
Street intersection during the peak hour periods studied. See the proposed queue diagram
PQ-1 in Appendix ,,B for more details.

The Synchro analysis for all other intersections in the study area indicated acceptable Levels
of Service for both existing and projected conditions with the following exceptions:




                                                                                           13
Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY         TIS Report Update ­November 2010

University Avenue at North Winton Road: The analysis of this intersection for existing
conditions indicated Level of Service ,,E for the eastbound left turn movement, the
westbound left turn movement, and the westbound left turn movement during the Friday PM
peak hour only. The impact of the site-generated traffic on this condition is projected to be
minor. The Level of Service for eastbound left turns and southbound left turns will remain at
,,E, and the westbound left turns can be improved to LOS ,,D with signal timing adjustments.

University Avenue at Probert Street: The analysis of this intersection for existing conditions
indicated LOS ,,E for the northbound approach during the weekday PM and Friday PM peak
hours. The shift in traffic caused by the closure of the Probert Street driveways will decrease
the traffic at this intersection and improve the movement to LOS ,,C.

Overall, the impact of the new Wegmans traffic is expected to be minor at all locations away
from the site entrances. The new site traffic pattern will be dispersed more uniformly due to
traffic signals at both driveways (University Avenue & East Avenue), thereby minimizing the
impacts at any one location. There is a negligible (a few seconds) decrease in LOS at East
Avenue at Winton Road, but the changes are not significant enough to warrant mitigation.


X.   SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS

The new Wegmans driveway to East Avenue will be located approximately 150 feet east of
Probert Street and the parking lot for the World Gym will be reconfigured to bring their
patrons in and out at a shared access point with the adjoining restaurant to utilize the signal
(see Appendix `A' for intersection details). Wegmans is seeking the removal of the existing
traffic signal at the intersection of East Avenue and Probert Street and the installation of a
new traffic signal at the intersection of East Avenue and the Wegmans driveway. A traffic
signal warrant analysis was conducted for each of these intersections to determine whether
the existing and projected traffic volumes meet the signal warrants set forth in the New York
State Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). The following warrants were
applied:

     Warrant #1A­ Minimum Vehicular Volume (Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume Warrant):
     The ,,Minimum Vehicular Volume, Condition A warrant is satisfied where the volume of
     intersecting traffic is the principal reason for consideration of signal installation. The
     warrant is satisfied when the minimum volumes specified in the MUTCD are met or
     exceeded for each of any eight hours of an average day. This warrant was met for 8
     hours of an average day at the intersection of East Avenue and Wegmans driveway. It
     was not met for the intersection of East Avenue and Probert Street during existing or
     proposed conditions.

     Warrant #1B ­ Interruption of Continuous Traffic (Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume
     Warrant):
     The ,,Interruption of Continuous Traffic, Condition B warrant is satisfied where the
     volume of the major street traffic is so heavy that the traffic on the intersecting minor
     street suffers excessive delay or conflict in entering or crossing the major roadway.
     The warrant is satisfied when the minimum volumes specified in the MUTCD are met or


                                                                                            14
Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY          TIS Report Update ­November 2010

     exceeded for each of any eight hours of an average day. This warrant was met for 8
     hours of an average day at the intersection of East Avenue and Wegmans driveway. It
     was not met for the intersection of East Avenue and Probert Street during existing or
     proposed conditions.
     The ,,Combination of Conditions A & B is intended for application at locations where
     Condition A is not satisfied and Condition B is not satisfied, but where at least 80
     percent of the stated volume values in both warrants 1A and 1B are met. This warrant
     was not applicable for the intersection of East Avenue and Wegmans Driveway;
     however, it was met for the intersection of East Avenue and Probert Street for existing
     conditions only.

     Warrant #2 ­ Four-Hour Volume Warrant:
     The ,,Four Hour Volume warrant is satisfied when the plotted points representing the
     vehicles per hour on the major street and the corresponding vehicles per hour on the
     higher volume minor street lie above the curves shown in the MUTCD for any four
     hours of an average day. This warrant was met for four hours of an average day at the
     intersection of East Avenue and Wegmans driveway. It was not met for the intersection
     of East Avenue and Probert Street during the existing or future scenarios.

     Warrant #3 - Peak Hour Volume Warrant:
     The ,,Peak Hour Volume warrant is satisfied when the plotted points representing the
     vehicles per hour on the major street and the corresponding vehicles per hour on the
     higher volume minor street lie above the curves shown in the MUTCD for any single
     hour of an average day. This warrant was met for a single hour of an average day at
     the intersection of East Avenue and Wegmans driveway. It was not met for the
     intersection of East Avenue and Probert Street during the proposed scenarios, however
     the warrant was met for the existing conditions.

The signal warrant analysis is shown in Appendix `E'. The existing traffic volumes at the
intersection of East Avenue and Probert Street meet only the ,,Combination of Warrant 1A &
1B and ,,Peak Hour Volume warrants. The projected traffic volumes at this intersection
would not meet any of the signal warrants. The elimination of Wegmans access to Probert
Street will result in a significant reduction in traffic volume on Probert Street. Therefore, the
existing traffic signal at the intersection of East Avenue and Probert Street would no longer
be warranted.

The signal warrant analysis for the intersection of East Avenue and the new Wegmans
driveway indicated that the projected traffic volumes would meet the ,,Eight Hour Volume,
,,Four Hour Volume and ,,Peak Hour Volume. It is expected that about half of the outbound
driveway traffic will turn left and half will turn right. Therefore, a traffic signal will be
warranted at the new Wegmans driveway on East Avenue.

University Avenue Driveway Signalization
MCDOT has determined that a signalized pedestrian crossing is warranted for the crossing
located adjacent to the Harris Corporation Building. This pedestrian signal will be installed
prior to the construction of the proposed Wegmans. Upon project completion MCDOT will
allow Wegmans to install a traffic signal at the parking lot driveway on University Avenue



                                                                                              15
Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY          TIS Report Update ­November 2010

concurrent with the pedestrian crossing, taking the place of the new pedestrian signal.
Therefore, all future analysis includes a signalized driveway on University Avenue.

University Avenue will be restriped to widen from a two lane section at Probert Street to a
three lane section at the Wegmans Driveway. The three lane section will then continue to
Harris Driveway located just east of the proposed store face. The center left turn lane will be
split between the Wegmans Driveway (westbound) and the Harris Driveway (eastbound)
providing 100+ for Wegmans and 75+ for Harris with about 50 of Continuous Two-Way
Left Turn (CTWLT) lane to allow additional capacity for each direction. The peak traffic times
for the left turns should be at different times allowing this arrangement to operate
satisfactorily.


The CTWLT lane will continue easterly and align with the existing left turn lane at Winton
Road allowing left turn storage for vehicles accessing both Wegmans and Harris employee
parking between Winton and the Harris Driveway. In the eastbound direction the single
through lane will widen to two lanes just west of the Harris Driveway to accommodate the
through/right lane at the intersection of North Winton Road. And in the westbound direction,
the two through lanes from Winton Road will narrow to one lane between Winton and the
Harris Driveway.



XI.   GAP ANALYSIS

A gap analysis was conducted on East Avenue between N. Winton Road and the existing
Wegmans entrance on East Avenue, on October 15, 2009. Two studies were conducted, one
during an off-peak hour between 2:30pm ­ 3:30pm and one during the weekday evening
peak hour between 4:45pm ­ 5:45pm. The results of the gap study are shown in Appendix
` H' .

The Highway Capacity Manual indicates that there is a 7.0 second minimum gap required
for one vehicle to turn left onto a four-lane major road from a minor street or driveway. Any
subsequent vehicle attempting to gain access using the same gap requires an additional 3.4
seconds.

There were opportunities for 58 vehicles to obtain left-turn access to East Avenue during the
weekday evening peak hour, according to the gap study. For the off-peak, there were
opportunities for approximately 100 vehicles to obtain left-turn access to East Avenue.

Given that the exiting volume at the proposed Wegmans driveway onto East Avenue for the
weekday evening peak is 298 vehicles, there will not be sufficient gaps for these exiting
vehicles. The installation of a traffic signal would allow for these vehicles to exit the site.

There will be 460 opportunities for the 144 right-turning vehicles exiting Wegmans parking
lot without a traffic signal, which is acceptable. The McDonalds 36 right-turning vehicles will
have opportunities for 415 vehicles to exit, without a traffic signal, which is also acceptable.


                                                                                             16

XII.   ACCIDENT HISTORY

An accident study was performed by TYLI (as FRA Engineering) in the "Wegmans Food
Market & Bank" East Avenue TIS dated June 2004. The study analyzed the three-year period
from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2003 between 1701 East Avenue
(McDonalds Restaurant) and 1844 East Avenue (Wendys Restaurant). A total of 86
accidents were reported within the study area including the intersections of Probert Street
and Winton Road. The intersection of East Avenue/Probert Street exceeded the Countywide
Accident Rate (17 accidents) as well as the midblock area between Probert Street.
Therefore, these two locations were re-investigated as a part of this study. Winton Road at
East Avenue (36 accidents) was below the Countywide accident rate and was not further
analyzed. Refer to Appendix `I' for the previous accident analysis.

Available accident data for the 2006 revision reported on a three-year period from March 1,
2003 through February 28, 2006 and was obtained through the City of Rochester Police
Department for the study area between 1701 East Avenue (McDonalds Restaurant) and
Winton Road including the Probert Street intersection. During this three-year period, a total
of 6 accidents occurred at the Probert Street intersection, 8 accidents occurred west of
Probert Street, and 19 accidents occurred along East Avenue between Probert Street and
Winton Road. Refer to Appendix `I' for the previous accident analysis.

An update of the accident analysis for this 2009 revision reports on a three-year period from
July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2009 and was obtained through the City of Rochester Police
Department for the study area between 1701 East Avenue (McDonalds Restaurant) and
Winton Road including the Probert Street intersection. During this three-year period, a total
of 7 accidents occurred at the Probert Street intersection, 5 accidents occurred west of
Probert Street, 26 accidents occurred along East Avenue between Probert Street and Winton
Road, and 19 accidents occurred at the N. Winton Road intersection. Refer to Appendix `I'
for the current accident analysis.

Table 4 summarizes the number and types of accidents that occurred within the project
limits during the most recent three-year study period.

The East Avenue/Probert Street intersection and midblock section (between Probert Street
to Winton Road) exceeded the countywide average rate the 2004 accident study from
January 1, 2001 through December 31. The 2006 data indicates the East Avenue/Probert
Street intersection was below the average rate and the midblock section rate had been
significantly reduced but still above the Countywide accident rate. The most recent 2009
data indicates the East Avenue/Probert Street intersection is slightly higher than the
countywide average rate and the midblock section rate is still less than the 2004 study,
however still significantly higher than the countywide average rate. Accident summary
sheets and a Collision diagrams are provided in Appendix `I'.

East Avenue/Probert Street
There were a total of 7 accidents that occurred during the three year time period studied at
the intersection of East Avenue and Probert Street. The accidents were 4 Rear End
accidents, 1 Overtaking accident, 1 Left Turn accident, and 1 Right Turn accident.

Of the 7 accidents there were no clears pattern or problems identified. Three of the Rear
End accidents occurred in the westbound direction with vehicles stopped for the red light.

Midblock Between Winton Road and Probert Street
There were a total of 24 accidents that occurred during the three-year time period studied
for this midblock. A majority of the accidents occurred during the day, under good weather
conditions and dry pavement conditions. Of the 24 accidents, there were 9 Left-Turn
accidents, 7 were Right-Angle accidents, 4 Overtaking accidents, 2 Rear End accidents, 1
Head-On accident, and a single accident involving a bicycle.

Further investigation revealed 8 of the 16 left-turn and right-angle accidents involved
vehicles making a left-turn into the path of an oncoming vehicle indicating they thought the
travel way was clear and their view was obstructed. Right-angle accidents often occur when
a vehicle is attempting to make a left-turn out of a driveway in traffic. Five of the left-turn
and right-angle accidents occurred at the Wegmans driveway. This can be mitigated with
the installation of a traffic signal at the proposed Wegmans driveway.


                                                                                               19
Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY                   TIS Report Update ­November 2010


Of the 4 Overtaking accidents, 2 were vehicles gaining access to exclusive turn lanes while
operators were not paying attention. There was no other clear patterns or problems
identified.

Midblock West of Probert Street
There were a total of 5 accidents at this midblock location. One accident was a Left-Turn
accident into the McDonalds property, one was a Rear-End accident in the westbound
direction, one was a Right-Angle accident, one was an Overtaking accident, and the
remaining accident was a Side-swipe collision between a bus and a vehicle that were both
attempting to occupy the center turn lane. There were no clear patterns or problems
identified.


XIII.      PEDESTRIAN AND RTS BUS CONSIDERATIONS

As part of the original 2004 Traffic Impact Study observations regarding pedestrian volumes,
travel patterns, and interactions with motor vehicles and RTS buses were conducted.

RTS Bus Considerations ­ This section is as written in the original 2004 TIS Report.
Applicable updates are written in italics at the bottom of each section.

Within the proximity of the site there are three RTS bus stop locations; one is located just
east (approximately 100-feet) of the Probert Street and University Avenue intersection on
the south side of University Avenue. A second bus stop is located on the west side of North
Winton Road, approximately 50-feet south of the North Winton Road and University Avenue
intersection; and a third bus stop is located on the north side of East Avenue, approximately
100-feet east of the existing Wegmans access drive.

The following table summarizes the posted Bus routes, bus schedules, and travel patterns
for the five bus routes in the vicinity of the Wegmans Food Market site.

Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY         TIS Report Update ­November 2010

As presented in Table 6, buses travel in the vicinity of the site on a regular basis throughout
the course of the average weekday. Currently there no concerns with the East Avenue bus
stop location or the North Winton Road bus stop location; however there has been concern
expressed by MCDOT in the past regarding the bus stop at the southeast corner of University
Avenue and Probert Street.

University Avenue Bus Stop: MCDOT conducted a field investigation in early 2002, related to
pedestrian safety, at this location in response to a request by Harris Corporation, which was
located on the north side of University Avenue between North Winton Road and Probert
Street. In their review of potential pedestrian conflicts at this location, MCDOT staff noted
that buses stopped at this location had a tendency to "block the visibility of the pedestrian
crossing sign for eastbound traffic and create a sight distance restriction for pedestrians
crossing University Avenue from the south side to the north side".

To address this concern MCDOT requested that RTS discontinue the practice of allowing
buses to layover at this bus stop, which significantly reduces the amount of time a bus is
stopped at this location and thus reduces the potential for visibility constraints on motorists
traveling eastbound on University Avenue. RTS has since complied with this request and
currently allows vehicles to layover on East Avenue at the East Avenue bus stop location,
where there are far fewer issues with visibility because of the midblock location.

There were still concerns with the bus stop location along University Avenue, primarily
because of the proximity to the Probert Street intersection and the lack of a clear pull-off
and loading/unloading area.

To address this concern, we recommended relocating this bus stop further east,
approximately even with the front of the Wegmans Food Market building and creating a well-
defined bus stop for clearer delineation for pedestrians and motorists.

As of October 2009, according to a site visit and verified by RGRTA, there is no longer a bus
stop on University Avenue near the Wegmans site. Therefore there is no further concern
with buses along University Avenue.

North Winton Road Bus Stop: This bus stop is located approximately 50-feet north of the
North Winton Road and University Avenue intersection on the west side of the street. This
bus stop is projected to operate at the same location and in the same manner as it does
today. Therefore, no recommendations are provided for this location.

East Avenue Bus Stop: This bus stop is located on the north side of East Avenue,
approximately 100-feet east of the Wegmans driveway onto East Avenue. This is perhaps
the busiest of the three bus stops and quite frequently serves as a layover point for buses
headed in the westbound direction. While there are no concerns with this location with the
current Wegmans Food Market, there is potential for conflict with the proposed Wegmans
Food Market.

The new Wegmans Food Market is proposing a second floor eatery, which will likely have a
balcony with "open-air" seating overlooking East Avenue. The noise and fumes associated
with buses laying over at this location would not be desirable or accommodating for


                                                                                            21
Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY         TIS Report Update ­November 2010

Wegmans patrons utilizing the eatery. In response to this concern, RTS was contacted to
discuss the possibility of relocating the bus stop further west on East Avenue. RTS personnel
was understanding and was agreeable to visiting the East Avenue location to identify a
better location for the bus stop.

It is recommended that Wegmans contact RTS once approval of the project is apparent in
order to facilitate the relocation of the bus stop.

Pedestrian Considerations

Due to the urban location, proximity to bus stops and major employers, such as Harris
Corporation, there is a higher than normal volume of pedestrian traffic at this location. A
majority of the pedestrian volumes are located along East Avenue and are traveling to and
from the bus stop on East Avenue and between the bus stop and the Wegmans Food
Market. See Figures 23 ­ 26 in Appendix ,,B for pedestrian counts conducted in 2004
during each of the four peak hours investigated.

Despite the fact that the majority of the pedestrian volumes are located on East Avenue,
there have been no concerns expressed regarding the volumes or potential for conflicts with
motor vehicles. However, concerns have been identified along University Avenue, specifically
related to pedestrians crossing the street between the Wegmans Food Market site and
Harris Corporation.

There is an Audible Pedestrian Signal at the crossing of the west leg of the intersection of
East Avenue and Probert Street. If the signal is relocated, the audible device must also be
relocated.

As indicated previously, MCDOT conducted a field investigation into these concerns and
provided the following five specific recommendations (See complete letter and findings in
Appendix `F'):

               Stripe a white edgeline as described in the MCDOT discussion.
               Remove the crosswalk on the west leg of the intersection of University Avenue
               and Probert Street.
               Restripe the remaining three crosswalks for use by Harris employers with
               "ladder" type cross hatching.
               Recommend to RTS that they discontinue using the bus stop just west of
               Wegmans easterly driveway on the south side of University Avenue as a
               layover point.
               Notify the City Engineer of the need for wheelchair ramps at the crosswalk just
               west of Probert Street.

Of these five recommendations, all appear to have been implemented as recommended.

As of October 2009, MCDOT has determined that a signal is warranted for pedestrian
crossing of University Avenue, as there is a high pedestrian volume from Harris Corporation
to Wegmans. The county has agreed to work with Wegmans to place the signal at the
proposed Wegmans Driveway on University Avenue.


                                                                                            22
Wegmans Food Market: East Avenue­City of Rochester, NY         TIS Report Update ­November 2010


Additionally, the proposed Wegmans Food Market project will make pedestrian-friendly
improvements to the entire site and adjacent rights-of-way including the following:

               Installing new sidewalks along the east side of Probert Street,
               Providing new sidewalks along all four streets immediately adjacent to the
               proposed project,
               Providing a combination of streetscape and hardscape amenities along all for
               streets, immediately adjacent to the proposed project, and
               Relocating the driveways on East Avenue and University Avenue further from
               the Wegmans Food Market entrance, in order to reduce the likelihood of
               vehicle/pedestrian conflicts.

TYLI conducted a pedestrian activity observation to update the pedestrian analysis at the
existing East Avenue Wegmans on Friday October 15 (Figure 25-A), and Saturday October
16, 2010 (Figure 26-A) during the Friday evening and Saturday midday peak hours. The
focuses of the observations were to:
        Count the number of pedestrians crossing East Avenue at the existing Probert Street
        intersection.
        Count the number of pedestrians crossing East Avenue along midblock near the
        Wegmans entrance.
        And to observe the pedestrians using the RTS busses along East Avenue.

For the observation, an approximate time and the general pattern of each pedestrian or
groups of pedestrians were recorded. The existing Probert Street intersection has
pedestrian signals for all crosswalks, and also has an audible pedestrian signal device on
its western crosswalk. Pedestrians that crossed at the Probert Street intersection generally
used the crosswalks. There were approximately 10 pedestrians per hour crossing at the
Probert Street intersection for both Friday evening and Saturday midday peak hours. Most
of the pedestrians crossing were headed to Wegmans and most of them walked through the
Wegmans parking lot to get to or from the storefront to the intersection. Moving the signal
closer to the storefront will encourage pedestrians to cross safely by bringing the signalized
crossing closer to the store front, while also discouraging pedestrians from walking through
the parking lot. The observations are summarized in Table 7.

The number of pedestrians crossing at the midblock between the Wegmans driveway and
Probert Street as well as east of the Wegmans drive was also observed. There was only on
average one pedestrian that crossed at the midblock per hour. These pedestrians usually
came from or went to the east on the south side of the sidewalk. On occasion, a customer at
one of the businesses to the south crossed the street, and once, a car parked on the south
side of the street with the driver crossing East Avenue to go to Wegmans.

It was noted that there are three on-street parking spots to the immediate east of the
existing Wegmans driveway. Observations show that these three spots are consistently
occupied by customers of the Wegmans store during both the Friday evening peak hour and
the Saturday midday peak hour.

During the Friday evening peak hour, the RTS bus traffic was also observed. The main bus
route that is serviced by this stop is Route #1 ­ Park Avenue route. A majority of the people
utilizing the busses at the East Avenue Wegmans stop are customers of Wegmans. On
average, 2-3 passengers got off the bus and went to Wegmans from every bus that stopped.
Most of the time two passengers (also Wegmans customers) got onto the bus. It was noted
that often times the bus passengers bring shopping carts out to the bus shelter, and then
leave them there when they get on the bus. However, sometimes the passengers getting off
the bus would grab a cart and bring it back to the store with them. It was noted that
Wegmans' helping hands employees did come and check for carts at regular intervals. A
summary of bus passengers observed on Friday is shown in Table 8.

In conclusion, a majority of the pedestrians in the area that are crossing East Avenue are
destined to the East Avenue Wegmans store. With the proposed signal location closer to the
store front, it will provide a safe way for pedestrians to cross East Avenue encouraging the
use of the sidewalk rather than the parking lot, and could reduce the number of mid-block
crossings.


XIV.   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The following is a summary of recommendations to mitigate the anticipated traffic from the
proposed project:

               Relocate the existing Wegmans driveways on East Avenue and University
               Avenue as shown in the site plan. Eliminate all access to Probert Street;
               reducing the overall number of curb cuts from 10 full access points to 3 full-
               access driveways and 3 limited-access driveways.

               Install a two-phase traffic signal at the intersection of East Avenue and the
               Wegmans Drive/World Gym intersection, with reconfiguration of the World
               Gym parking lot.

               Remove the existing traffic signal at the intersection of East Avenue and
               Probert Street.

               Install a westbound left-turn lane into the Wegmans Food Market site on
               University Avenue. And stripe University Avenue with one lane in each
               direction and a two-way left-turn lane from the proposed Wegmans signalized
               driveway to just west of the Harris Driveway.
               Providing streetscape improvements and pedestrian accommodations along
               East Avenue, Probert Street, University Avenue and North Winton Road;



                                                                                              25

               including textured/painted crosswalks at all intersections and driveway
               locations within the vicinity of the project site.


Although the proposed Wegmans Driveway on East Avenue would warrant a traffic signal
and the anticipated volumes would be substantially greater than the traffic at the Probert
Street/McDonalds ,,EXIT Drive on East Avenue, for the future condition, relocation of the
traffic signal is being discussed with the City of Rochester, MCDOT, McDonalds, and World
Gym.

Relocating the existing traffic signal would shift the existing East Avenue eastbound queue
to the new signal and allow for better access into the McDonalds entrance driveway. The
gap analysis indicated that with the relocation of the traffic signal, gaps would be available a
majority of the time for traffic exiting the McDonalds driveway. However, during the times of
peak traffic volumes on East Avenue, the exiting traffic may not have adequate gaps. If
possible, cross access for the McDonalds site to the adjacent property to the east should be
a consideration in the discussion with the City of Rochester, MCDOT and McDonalds to have
indirect access to the relocated traffic signal.

not for the intersection as a whole. Levels range from A to F, with A describing traffic
operations with little or no delays. Level of Service analysis for TWSC unsignalized
intersections considers the left-turn out of the minor road, the right-turn out of the minor road,
and the left-turn entering the minor road. The average control delay is defined as the total
elapsed time from when a vehicle stops at the end of a queue until the vehicle departs from the
stop line. This includes the time required for the vehicle to travel from the "last-in-queue"
position to the "first-in-queue" position, including deceleration of vehicles from free-flow speed
to the speed of vehicles in queue.

Average control delay for any particular minor movement is a function of the capacity of the
approach and the degree of saturation. Because different transportation facilities cause different
driver perceptions, the LOS criteria for TWSC intersections are different from the criteria for
signalized intersections.
                       DEFINITIONS OF LEVEL OF SERVICE FOR
                            SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS


Level of Service describes the quality of operation in terms of delay to the driving public. Levels
range from A to F describing traffic operation with very little delay. Definitions for levels of
Service follow. The Level of Service analysis provides a basis for assessing the potential impact
of traffic; both in terms of how traffic conditions would change and whether the existing
transportation system would be adequate for the additional traffic.

Level of Service for signalized intersections is defined in terms of control delay. Control delay
is a component of delay that results when a control signal causes a lane group to reduce speed or
stop. It is measured by comparison with the uncontrolled condition. Delay is a measure of
driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and lost travel time.

Specifically, level-of-service criteria are stated in terms of control delay per vehicle for a 15-
minute analysis period. The criteria are given in the following table:



                                                                   Stopped Delay
           Level of Service                                     Per Vehicle (seconds)

                   A                                                      0 - 10.0
                   B                                                  >10.0 - 20.0
                   C                                                  >20.0 - 35.0
                   D                                                  >35.0 - 55.0
                   E                                                  >55.0 - 80.0
                   F                                                        >80.0


Control delay is a complex measure and is dependent on a number of variables including: the
quality of traffic progression, the cycle length, and the relative amount of green time for the lane
group or approach in question.

Level-of-Service A describes operations with very low control delay, i.e., less than 10.0 seconds
per vehicle. This occurs when progression is extremely favorable and most vehicles arrive
during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute
to low delay.

Level-of-Service B describes operations with control delay in the range of 10.1 to 20.0 seconds
per vehicle. This generally occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More
vehicles stop than for Level A, causing higher levels of average delay.
Level-of Service C describes vehicles with control delay in the range of 20.1 to 35.0 seconds per
vehicle. These higher delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths.
Individual cycle failures may begin to appear in this level. The number of vehicles stopping is
significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection without stopping.

Level-of-Service D describes operations with control delay in the range of 35.1 to 55.0 seconds
per vehicle. At level D, the influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays
may result from some combination of unfavorable progression or long cycle lengths. Many
vehicles stop and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle failures are
noticeable.

Level-of-Service E describes operations with control delay in the range of 55.1 to 80.0 per
vehicle. This is considered the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally
indicate poor progression and long cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures are frequent
occurrences.

Level-of-Service F describes operations with control delay in excess of 80.0 seconds per vehicle.
This is considered unacceptable by most drivers. This condition often occurs with over-
saturation, i.e., when arrival flow rates exceed the capacity of the intersection. It may also occur
at high v/c ratios below 1.00 with many individual cycle failures. Poor progression and long
cycle lengths may also be major contributing causes to such delay levels.

Dear Ms. Zacher:

        The intent of this letter is to obtain your concurrence on the National Register of
Historic Places (National Register)-eligibility of the architectural resources associated
with the closure of Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base (NAS JRB) Willow Grove.
Under legislation enacted in 2005, the Navy closed NAS JRB Willow Grove and its
associated properties on September 15, 2011 and will subsequently transfer portions of
the United States Navy (Navy)-owned property for redevelopment to non-federal entities.
The Horsham Township Land Reuse Authority (HLRA) will coordinate redevelopment
efforts for the main base and for the two off-base housing sites.

       As part of the closure process, National Register-eligibility evaluations were
conducted to comply with Sections 106 and 110 ofthe National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA), as amended, and in support of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
documents. The Navy coordinated architectural and archaeological investigations, in
accordance with federal law and Navy procedures. Additional information regarding the
evaluation of archaeological resources will be forthcoming.

       On September 13, 2010, representatives of the Navy and Southeastern
Archaeological Research (SEARCH), Inc. met with representatives of the Pennsylvania
State Historic Preservation Office (PA SHPO) to kick-off consultation regarding the
planned closure. A general framework for National Register evaluations at the base was
discussed and cultural resources study began immediately following the meeting.

        The Navy determined that the area of potential effect (APE) for this undertaking
is the Navy-owned property associated with NAS JRB Willow Grove that will potentially
be transferred out of federal ownership. The APE includes the 1,170-acre main base in
Horsham Township, Montgomery County, the 2.5-acre Jacksonville Road housing
enclave in Ivyland Borough, Bucks County, and the 51-acre Shenandoah Woods housing
site in Warminster Township, Bucks County. The following two enclosed
comprehensive reports detail these facilities:
   1) Architectural Assessment and National Register ofHistoric Places Evaluation of
       Above-Ground Navy-Owned Resources Located at Naval Air Station Joint
       Reserve Base Willow Grove, Willow Grove, Pennsylvania (March 2011 Draft
       SEARCH). (enclosure 1)
   2)  Historic Structures Survey and Determination ofEligibility Report ofSelect
       Facilities at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove, Willow Grove,
       Horsham Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania and Off-Base Housing
       Enclaves in Warminster Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania (August 2011
       Draft-AECOM). (enclosure 2)

         At the main base, the SEARCH report surveyed 121 architectural resources, and
concluded that six ammunition magazines may meet National Register criteria under the
"Program Comment for World War II and Cold War-Era (1939-1974) Ammunition
Storage Facilities." After receiving the draft SEARCH report, the Navy sought
clarification in the utilization of the ammunition storage program comments. While there
is no definitive guidance on whether the program comments make ammunition storage
facilities covered under its stipulations automatically National Register-eligible, it
appears that the intetpretation ofthis agreement commonly varies. The Navy feels that
the ammunition storage representatives at NAS JRB Willow Grove are not significant
resources, and are, therefore, not National Register-eligible. If, however, the PA SHPO
disagrees with this intetpretation, the six resources which fall under the program
comment will require no further compliance with preservation statutes. SEARCH
concluded that the remaining 115 resources are not eligible for inclusion in the National
Register either as individual resources or a historic district. AECOM inventoried an
additiona114 resources at the main base and concluded that none are National Register
eligible.

        AECOM inventoried six houses at the off-base Jacksonville Road enclave, and
concluded that the Jacksonville Road Off-Base Housing Enclave Historic District is
eligible under the "Program Comment for Capehart and Wherry Era Housing and
Associated Structures and Landscape Features (1949-1962)." AECOM recommended the
buildings as eligible as a district only, citing their significance as representatives ofthe
Wherry Act program, not in their individual characteristics.

        At the Shenandoah Woods off-base housing site, AECOM concluded that the
development as a whole does not meet National Register Criteria Consideration G for
exceptional importance as a Cold War-era resource. The report details the housing types
utilized at Shenandoah Woods and includes associated structures and features.

        Pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA, AECOM report CDs, PHMC BHP Access
database, and Pennsylvania historic resource survey forms, (enclosures 3-5) are provided
to continue consultation with your agency, to facilitate effective planning in conjunction
with the NEPA process, and to plan for the disposal ofthe Navy-owned facilities.
       Based on the information enumerated above, mUltiple site visits by Navy cultural
resources staff, and the enclosed deliverables, the Navy has determined the following:

 ·  The NAS JRB Willow Grove main base contains no individually National Register
    eligible architectural resources, nor does the assembly or any portion of resources on
    the main base constitute an eligible historic district.
 ·  The Jacksonville Road Off-Base Housing Enclave Historic District is National 

    Register-eligible, however, the program comment for Wherry housing covers all 

    compliance with preservation statutes. 

 ·  The Shenandoah Woods off-base housing site does not meet National Register
    Criteria Consideration G for exceptional importance, and is therefore, not eligible.

        In accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA and other applicable historic
preservation statutes and procedures, the Navy requests you to concur with these findings
by letter, within thirty days to foster adequate planning for the pending transfers. Please
provide us with an environmental review number for this project, if necessary. Feel free
to contact NAVFAC Atlantic architectural historian Darrell E. Cook, at (757) 322-4282,
or by email atdarrell.e.cook@navy.mil. if you have questions about the architectural
survey materials.

Dear Mr. McLearen:

      Thank you for your letter of August 14, 2012 concurring with the
Navy recommendation that archaeological sites 36 Mg 0459 (Area B); 36
Mg 0460 (Area D); 36 Bu 0427 (Area G); and 36 Bu 0429 (Area G),
at Willow Grove PA are potentially eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D.

     As you requested, we confirm that Navy will provide deed
restrictions and covenants with the property recipients in order to
provide for the evaluative testing of these four sites.   These
covenants and deed restrictions will require that no disturbance of
the ground surface or any other thing shall be undertaken or
permitted to be undertaken on the archeological sites that would
affect the physical integrity of the archeological sites without
first obtaining the prior written permission of the PA SHPO. (See
enclosure for an example) . We will also provide two additional
copies of the final report for your files under separate cover as
requested.

      Based on these actions contained in this correspondence, we have
satisfied Section 106 of the National Historical Preservation Act of
1966 and its implementing regulation. Questions may be directed to
Thomas Stephan at (215) 897-4916, or by email at

Covenant re Archeological Matters: As more fully described in the document attached
to this Quitclaim Deed and incorporated herein as Exhibit A, areas within NAS JRB
Willow Grove PA have been identified and are referred to within, collectively, as
Archeological Sites. GRANTEE, its successors, and its assigns hereby covenant at all
times to the Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Officer ("PA SHPO") to maintain
and preserve the Archeological Site as follows:

                1.     No disturbance of the ground surface or any other thing shall be
       undertaken or permitted to be undertaken on the Archeological Sites that would
       affect the physical integrity of the Archeological Site without frrst obtaining the
       prior written permission of the PA SHPO (signed by a fully authorized
       representative thereof). Should the P A SHPO require, as a condition to granting
       of such permission, that GRANTEE conduct a Phase ll survey, archeological
       data recovery operations or other activities designed to mitigate the adverse
       effect of the proposed activity on the Archeological Site, GRANTEE shall at its
       own expense conduct such activities in accordance with the Secretary of the
       Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeological Documentation (48 FR
       447344-37) and such standards and guidelines as PA SHPO may specify
       (including, but not limited to, standards and guidelines for research design, field
       work, analysis, preparation and dissemination of reports, disposition of artifacts
       and other materials, consultation with Native American or other organizations,
       andre-interment of human remains).

               2.     GRANTEE shall make every reasonable effort to prohibit any
       person from vandalizing or otherwise disturbing the Archeological Site and
       shall promptly report any such disturbance to the PA SHPO.

              3.      GRANTEE will allow the PA SHPO or his/her designee, upon
       reasonable advance notice to GRANTEE, an annual inspection of the
       Archeological Sites in order to ascertain whether GRANTEE is complying with
       the conditions of this preservation covenant.

               4.      In the event of a violation of this covenant, and in addition to any
       remedy now or hereafter provided by law, GOVERNMENT, or (upon 60 days
       prior notice to GOVERNMENT) PA SHPO, may, following reasonable written
       notice to GRANTEE, institute a suit to enjoin said violation or to require the
       restoration of the Archeological Site.


              5.      The failure by GOVERNMENT or by the PA SHPO to exercise
       any right or remedy granted under this covenant shall not have the effect of
       waiving or limiting the exercise by GOVERNMENT or by the PA SHPO of any
other right or remedy or the use of such right or remedy at any other time

        6.      This covenant shall be binding on GRANTEE, its successors,
and its assigns in perpetuity. The restrictions, stipulations, and covenants
contained herein shall be inserted by GRANTEE, its successors, and its assigns,
verbatim or by express reference in any deed or other legal instrument by which
such party divests itself of either the fee-simple title or any lesser estate in the
archeological site or any part thereof.

        7.      This covenant shall be a binding servitude upon the real property
that includes the Archeological Site and shall be deemed to run with the land.
Recording this Quitclaim Deed shall constitute conclusive evidence that
GRANTEE agrees to be bound by the foregoing conditions and restrictions and
to perform the obligations herein set forth.

Wildlife Impact Review Coordinator

Division of Environmental Planning and Habitat Protection

Harrisburg, PA 17110-9797

Dear Ms. Mowery:

     The Navy closed Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base
(NASJRB) Willow Grove, located in Horsham Township, Montgomery
County, Pennsylvania in accordance with the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Act (BRAC) of 1990, as amended in 2005. The
Navy is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for
the disposal and reuse of the property. An online Pennsylvania
Natural Diversity Inventory (PNDI) search of the project area
was conducted on March 8, 2013 using the PNDI Environmental
Review Tool and is provided in enclosure 1. Although the
results of the search indicate that no further review is
required by your office, the Navy is requesting information from
your office regarding the potential occurrence of threatened,
endangered, and/or special concern species, unique natural
communities, or other significant wildlife communities at or
near NASJRB Willow Grove. This letter contains all information
requested on the PNDI Project Planning and Environmental Review
Form. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,
Bureau of Forestry; Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission,
Natural Diversity Section; and, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service are also being contacted to request similar information.

     The proposed project is within the NE Ambler Quad of the
USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle map (enclosure 2). The EIS would
analyze the potential environmental consequences of the reuse of
the property in a manner consistent with the Horsham Township
Athority for NASJRB Willow Grove (HLRA) NASJRB Willow Grove
Redevelopment Plan (March 2012) . The entire property
encompasses approximately 862 acres.  Full build-out is proposed
to be implemented over a 20-year period and three action
alternatives are being assessed for this project:
                                              5090
                                              Ser BPMOE/13-063
                                              March 27, 2013

1. Alternative 1 (HLRA Plan - Preferred Alternative): The
   Redevelopment Plan calls for the redevelopment of most of the
   installation property (enclosure 3). Two facilities, the Navy
   Lodge and the installation fire station, would be reused and
   all other facilities, including the airfield, would be
   demolished. The Redevelopment Plan includes a mix of land use
   types and densities, as well as open space and natural areas.
   The Redevelopment Plan was designed to incorporate mixed-use,
   pedestrian-oriented features (e.g., a town center, walkable
   neighborhoods, and bike lanes), open spaces, best management
   practices for storm water management, and green and
   sustainable design principles. This alternative calls for the
   development of approximately 650 acres (76%) of the total
   installation property.

2. Alternative 2 (HLRA Plan with Increased Residential
   Development): Alternative 2 provides for a higher density of
   residential and community mixed-use development (enclosure 4).
   As with Alternative 1, the airfield and most installation
   facilities would be demolished. This alternative includes a
   mix of land use types, open space and natural areas, and
   incorporates smart-growth principles that include pedestrian-
   friendly transportation and compact development. This
   alternative calls for the development of approximately 580
   acres (67%) of the total installation property.

3. Alternative 3 (Airfield Reuse): Alternative 3 would maintain
   the existing runway and a portion of the taxiways, parking
   aprons, and hanger space for airfield operations (enclosure
   5). After accounting for the area taken up by critical
   airfield/air operation elements, the remaining land available
   for redevelopment is approximately 380 acres (44%) . The
   layout of Alternative 3 incorporates the approximate sizes and
   locations of several Alternative 1 elements, such as the
   recreation center, aviation museum, and golf course. However,
   due to the proximity to the airfield and the limited available
   land, this option excludes virtually all residential
   development land uses, including the town center. Areas such
   as the hotel and conference center have been moved to the

Dear Ms. Bowen:

      The Navy closed Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base
 (NASJRB) Willow Grove, located in Horsham Township, Montgomery
County, Pennsylvania in accordance with the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Act (BRAC) of 1990, as amended in 2005. The
Navy is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for
the disposal and reuse of the property. An online Pennsylvania
Natural Diversity Inventory (PNDI) search of the project area
was conducted on March 8, 2013 using the PNDI Environmental
Review Tool and is provided in enclosure 1. Although the
results of the search indicate that no further review is
required by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and
Natural Resources, the Navy is requesting information from your
office regarding the potential occurrence of threatened,
endangered, and/or special concern species, unique natural
communities, or other significant wildlife communities at or
near NAS JRB Willow Grove. This letter contains all information
requested on the PNDI Project Planning and Environmental Review
Form.   The Pennsylvania Game Commission, Bureau of Wildlife
Habitat Management; Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission,
Natural Diversity Section; and, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service are also being contacted to request similar information.

The proposed project is within the NE Ambler Quad of the USGS
7.5-minute quadrangle map (enclosure 2). The EIS would analyze
the potential environmental consequences of the reuse of the
property in a manner consistent with the Horsham Township
Authority for NASJRB Willow Grove (HLRA) NASJRB Willow Grove
Redevelopment Plan (March 2012). The entire property
encompasses approximately 862 Acres.  Full build-out is proposed
to be implemented over a 20-year period and three action
alternatives are being assessed for this project:
                                            5090

                                            March 27, 2013

1. Alternative 1 (HLRA Plan - Preferred Alternative}: The
   Redevelopment Plan calls for the redevelopment of most of the
   installation property (enclosure 3}. Two facilities, the Navy
   Lodge and the installation fire station, would be reused and
   all other facilities, including the airfield, would be
   demolished.  The Redevelopment Plan includes a mix of land use
   types and densities, as well as open space and natural areas.
   The Redevelopment Plan was designed to incorporate mixed-use,
                                                          \

   pedestrian-oriented features (e.g., a town center, walkable
   neighborhoods, and bike lanes}, open spaces, best management
   practices for storm water management, and green and
   sustainable design principles. This alternative calls for the
   development of approximately 650 acres (76%} of the total
   installation property.

2. Alternative 2 (HLRA Plan with Increased Residential
   Development} : Alternative 2 provides for a higher density of
   residential and community mixed-use development (enclosure 4}
   As with Alternative 1, the airfield and most installation
   facilities would be demolished. This alternative includes a
   mix of land use types, open space and natural areas, and
                                                          \

   incorporates smart-growth principles that include pedestrian-
   friendly transportation and compact development.  This
   alternative calls for the development of approximately 580
   acres (67%} of the total installation property.

3. Alternative 3 (Airfield Reuse}: Alternative 3 would maintain
   the existing runway and a portion of the taxiways, parking
   aprons, and hanger space for airfield operations (enclosure
   5) . After accounting for the area taken up by critical
   airfield/air operation elements, the remaining land available
   for redevelopment is approximately 380 acres (44%) . The
   layout of Alternative 3 incorporates the approximate sizes and
   locations of several Alternative 1 elements, such as th~
   recreation center, aviation museum, and golf course. However,
   due to the proximity to the airfield and the limited available
   land, this option excludes virtually all residential
   development land uses, including the town center. Areas such
   as the hotel and conference center have been moved to the
   southern portion of the property (along Horsham Road), away

  from the airfield. Alternative 3 would provide more green
  space compared to Alternative 1 due to safety requirements for
  open space surrounding the airfield. This alternative calls
  for the development of approximately sao acres (65%) of the
  total installation property.

Introduction

This appendix describes the methodology, assumptions, and multipliers used to develop the construction
cost, economic impact, full build-out employment, population and tax revenue projections provided in
Section 4.2 ­ Socioeconomic Environmental Consequences. In addition, similar details are provided for
the water supply, wastewater, stormwater, and utility projections presented in Section 4.8 ­ Infrastructure.

In order to provide a concise and easy-to-follow discussion of the potential impacts of implementing
Alternative 1, Alternative 2, Alternative 3 or the No Action Alternative on these resource areas, only the
summary tables and results were provided in the text of the EIS. The balance of the information is
provided in this appendix, which is organized into the following sections:

B-1       Methodology and Assumptions for Socioeconomic Environmental Consequences

Construction Cost Projections
The construction cost estimates are the sum of estimated structure construction and infrastructure costs.

Structure construction costs were estimated by multiplying the assumed square footage for each type of
development by a "cost-per-square-foot" multiplier. For the residential structures, the estimated total
square footage was calculated by multiplying the number of units (e.g., of large-lot, single-family homes)
contained in the Redevelopment Plan by an assumed square footage per unit 1. For the other structures,
the assumed total square footage assumptions were taken from the Redevelopment Plan. The majority of
the cost per square foot multipliers were adapted from an Excel workbook, entitled "FINAL
IMPACTS.xlsx" created by RKG Associates, Inc. 2,3

Infrastructure costs were adapted from Table 11-3 in RKG Associates, Inc.'s report 4 (RKG 2012).

Economic Impact Projections
The construction expenditures associated with the potential redevelopment scenarios would create a direct
economic impact on the regional economy in the form of increased output, employment and employee
earnings, as firms and workers located in the region are hired to undertake the construction activities.
Indirect economic impacts would occur when local suppliers provide materials for the construction
activities and induced economic impacts would occur when the construction workers spend a portion of
their incomes in the regional economy.

To estimate the total impact (i.e., the sum of the direct, indirect and induced impacts) on regional output,
employment and employee earnings use was made of multipliers, relating to the construction industry in
Montgomery and Bucks Counties in Pennsylvania, derived from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis'
economic modeling system known as the Regional Input-Output Modeling System or "RIMS II" (U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis 2013). The estimates for the total change in regional output and employee
earnings were calculated by multiplying construction expenditures by the appropriate multipliers. The
estimates of the total change in employment were calculated by dividing the construction expenditures by
a million, re-expressing them in 2010 prices and then multiplying the result by the appropriate multiplier.
The multipliers used in these calculations are reported in Table B-1.

Full Build-Out Employment Projections
During the operations phase (i.e., employment at full build-out), workers would be permanently employed
at the former installation property. To estimate the number of on-site jobs for each of the alternatives,
RKG Associates, Inc.'s methodology was utilized. For most types of development this involved applying
"employees per square foot estimates from the Urban Land Institute (ULI) and the U.S. Energy
Information Administration (EIA)" to the assumed square footage for each type of development (RKG
2012). However, for the Housing for Homeless, Regional Recreation Center and Aviation Museum,
RKG Associates, Inc. simply assumed a certain total number of employees 5. Table B-2 contains the
employees per square foot estimates and the assumed total number of employees used in estimating direct
employment for each type of development 6.

For Alternative 3 that included reuse of the airfield, in addition to the direct employment estimated in the
manner described above, an estimate of direct employment at the potential general aviation airport was
also calculated using a correlation between data on employment and the number of takeoffs and landings
at Pennsylvanian airports. (Wilbur Smith and Associates, Inc. 2011) 7. Combining the observed numerical
relationship between employment and the number of takeoffs and landings with the estimated number of
annual aircraft operations at the general aviation airport yielded the airfield direct employment estimate.

The increased business activity caused by on-site employment would lead to additional indirect and
induced employment in the regional economy. Indirect and induced employment estimates were
developed using the estimated number of direct jobs and multiplier values from the RIMS II economic
modeling system (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 2013). The multiplier values used for this purpose
are called "direct effect employment multipliers" and differ between industrial categories. The multiplier
for the most appropriate industrial category was used for each type of development (e.g., the multiplier

    The table contains the assumed number of employees for Housing for Homeless, Regional Recreation Center and
    Aviation Museum for Alternative 1. These numbers were scaled according to the square footage of each type of
    development for Alternatives 2 and 3.
7
    It was estimated, using this data, that every 1,000 annual take-offs and landings at an airport was associated with
    an additional 7.25 employees.

for the retail trade industry was used for retail structures). Multiplying the direct employment estimates
by the appropriate multiplier (minus one so as to not double count direct employment) calculated the
indirect and induced employment estimates.

Population Projections
The population estimates were produced using the number and types of residential structures detailed in
the Redevelopment Plan (RKG 2012) in combination with data on the average household size by type of
housing unit for Horsham Township. Table B-3 shows how residential structures were categorized by
occupier type.

The data on average household sizes for owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing units were taken
from the 2007-2011 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates 8 (U.S. Census Bureau 2011a).

Tax Revenue Projections
Estimates were made of the revenues from the real estate tax, the school district tax, the earned income
tax and all other taxes. Each source of tax revenues is discussed in turn below.

Real Estate and School District Taxes
Real estate and school district tax revenues were estimated by multiplying assessed property values by the
Township and School District millage rates 9. Assessed property values were estimated by summing the
value of the structure and the value of the land and multiplying the result by the Common Level Ratio for
Montgomery County 10. Structure values were calculated in the manner described in Construction Cost
Projections and land values were estimated using RKG Associates Inc.'s methodology. For residential
structures, land values were assumed to be equal to a percentage of structure values. For commercial,
community services and recreation development, a value per acre of land was assumed for each
development type and multiplied by the number of acres used by each development type.

   The average household size for owner-occupied housing units was 2.89 persons, and for renter-occupied units was
   1.96 persons.

Earned Income Tax
Horsham Township levies a 1 percent tax on the local incomes of those who reside in Horsham and on the
local incomes of non-resident workers who do not pay earned income tax to their town of residence11.

Following RKG Associates, Inc.'s methodology, total local incomes were estimated for each type of
development. For the residential development types, total local incomes were estimated by multiplying
the number of units by the median household income for Horsham Township 12. For commercial,
community services and recreation developments, total local incomes were estimated by multiplying the
number of workers eligible to pay earned income tax by average annual pay in the most appropriate
industrial category for each type of development (e.g., average annual pay for the retail trade industry was
used for retail structures) 13.

Other Taxes
In accordance with RKG Associates, Inc.'s methodology, the estimate for other taxes was calculated by
dividing the 2012 total for all other taxes (Horsham Township 2013c) by the total assessed value for all
properties to obtain the equivalent of a tax rate which was then applied to the estimated assessed value of
the proposed developments.




11
   RKG Associates, Inc. assumed that 94.0 percent of direct jobs create would be filled by non-residents and that
   only 10 percent of non-residents would be eligible to pay earned income tax to Horsham Township.
12
   The median household income for Horsham Township was taken from the American Community Survey (US
   Census Bureau 2011b) and was updated to a 2013 value using the consumer price index (Bureau of Labor
   Statistics 2013a)
13
   Average annual pay data relating to Montgomery County, Pennsylvania were taken from the Quarterly Census of
   Employment and Wages (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2013b).

B-2      Methodology and Assumptions for Infrastructure and Utility Environmental
         Consequences

Water Supply and Wastewater Projections
The assumptions used in determining the land use-specific multipliers for water and wastewater
projections were obtained from Nelson 2004. Nelson adapted these multipliers from Environmental
Health Planning Guide and Environmental Health Practice in Recreational Areas (U.S. Public Health
Service n.d. (a), n.d. (b)), and it is noted in the text book that "No warranty is made that the figures
reported ... reflect the consumption characteristics of any given local government" (Nelson 2004, pp.
105 and 106).

Commercial and Mixed Use
Commercial land use was assumed to be similar to Office land use in terms of water demand and
wastewater generation. It was assumed that average water usage and wastewater generation would be
similar to that of an office building. Office water demand and wastewater generation is generally more
constant than the intermittent high/low demands at, for example, a conference center which would be
expected to experience high and low demands depending on the presence of an event. However, looking
on average across a long period of time, it is assumed the two different land uses would use similar
amounts of water and generate similar amounts of wastewater.

The multiplier for the Commercial land use water demand and wastewater generation is in average
gallons per day (gpd) per 1,000 square feet of space. It was assumed that this would be 125 gpd per 1,000
square feet (or 0.125 gpd per square foot) for water consumption, and 119 gpd per 1,000 square feet (or
0.119 gpd per square foot) for wastewater generation.

To project water demand and wastewater generation under Alternative 1, 2 and 3, the Commercial land
use multiplier was multiplied by the number of square feet of Commercial land use within each specified
land use category at full build-out.

Example: Use of Water Demand Multiplier for Commercial and Mixed Land Use*.

Under Alternative 1, in the Hotel/Conference land use area it is expected that 137,000 square feet of
Commercial land use will be available at full build-out. As shown by Equation 1 below, multiplying the
Commercial land use water demand multiplier (0.125 gpd per square foot) to the number of square feet
projected (137,000 square feet) gives an estimate of 17,125 gpd of water demand for Hotel/Conference
land use in the Commercial land use area at full build out under Alternative 1.

Equation 1: 137,000 ft2 × 0.125 gpd /ft2 = 17,125 gpd **

* The same methodology was used to project wastewater generation; substituting in 0.119 gpd per square foot for the multiplier.
** Note: Numbers may not match directly with table due to rounding in the build-out analysis for number of square feet of non-
   residential space.

Community Services and Recreation
The Community Services and Recreation land use was assumed to be similar to the Commercial land use
in terms of water demand and wastewater generation. It was assumed that average water usage and
wastewater generation would be comparable to that of an office building. For example; in an education
facility there could be classes, events, or faculty offices that might create high and low water demands.
However, looking on average across a long period of time, it is assumed that offices and education
facilities would require similar quantities of water and generate similar quantities of wastewater.



Draft EIS                                                    B-9                                  December 2013
The multiplier for the Community Services and Recreation water demand and wastewater generation is in
terms of average gallons per day (gpd) per 1,000 square feet of space. It was assumed that this would be
125 gpd per 1,000 square feet (or 0.125 gpd per square foot) for water demand, and 119 gpd per 1,000
square feet (or 0.119 gpd per square foot) for wastewater generation.

To project water demand and wastewater generation under Alternative 1, Alternative 2 and Alternative 3,
the multiplier was multiplied by the number of square feet of Commercial Services and Recreation land
use within each specified land use category. The same is true for estimated water consumption and
wastewater generation.

Example: Use of Water Consumption Multiplier for School Facility Land Use*.

Under Alternative 1, in the Community Services and Recreation land use district, it is expected that there
will be 152,727 square feet of School facility land use at full build-out. As shown in Equation 2 below,
multiplying the School facility land use water consumption multiplier (0.125 gpd per square foot) to the
projected number of square feet (152,727 square feet) gives an estimate of 19,091 gpd of water demand
for School facility land use at full build-out under Alternative 1.

Equation 2: 152,727 ft2 × 0.125 gpd/ft2 = 19,091 gpd**

* The same methodology was used to project wastewater generation; substitute in 0.119 gpd per square foot for the multiplier.
** Note: Numbers may not match directly with table due to rounding in the build-out analysis for number of square feet of non-
   residential space.

Residential
All residential unit water demand and wastewater generation multipliers are in gpd per housing unit. The
following assumptions and water demand and wastewater multipliers were used for residential units. For
large and small lot single family units a Single Family multiplier of 280 gpd/unit was used. Although it is
likely that a 5-bedroom home would use more water and create more wastewater than a single-family
home with 2 bedrooms; the multiplier is assumed to be an average; therefore, is applicable to all single
family homes regardless of the number of bedrooms. However, for quarter acre single family lots a
smaller multiplier of 180 gpd/unit was used based on the assumption that these quarter acre lots would
have significantly less occupancy and yard space resulting in less water demand and wastewater
generation.

Two multiplier categories were used for residential unit types designated as townhomes, condos, and
apartments. The multiplier categories were split between apartments with less than (<) 3 bedrooms and
those with 3 or more () bedrooms. To project water consumption and wastewater generation under
Alternative 1, Alternative 2 and Alternative 3, the specific residential unit multiplier was multiplied by
the number of residential units for each residential type.

Under Alternative 1, it is expected that there will be 90 large lot single family residences. As shown in
Equation 3 below; applying the single family multiplier (280 gpd/unit) to the number of units projected
(90 units) gives an estimate of 25,200 gpd of water demand for large lot single family residences and full
build out.

Equation 3: 90 units × 280 gpd/unit = 25,200 gpd**

* The same methodology was used to project wastewater generation; substitute in 162 gpd per unit for the multiplier.
** Note: Numbers may not match directly with table due to rounding in the build-out analysis for number of units.

Total Water Consumption and Wastewater Generation. Upon calculating water consumption and
wastewater generation by each land use type or residential unit, the subtotals by land use district were
summed to achieve a grand total under Alternatives 1, 2, and 3 at full build out, which are shown in
summary in Section 4.8 and shown in detail by alternative below (see Tables B-4 to B-6).

Impervious Surface Area Projections
The total impervious surface areas that would result from the implementation of Alternative 1, Alternative
2, or Alternative 3 were projected utilizing the final build-out projections identified in Section 2 and
applying local zoning dimension requirements. The total impervious surface area includes existing and
the potential new surface areas (i.e., buildings, structures, parking lots, roadways, and sidewalks) resulting
from the maximum build-out of Alternative 1, Alternative 2 or Alternative 3. Alternatives 1 and 2
include removal of the existing runway and Alternative 3 accounts for the runway being reused and
remaining in-place.

The impervious surface area projections are used only for planning and assessment purposes and should
not be interpreted as an absolute definition of future conditions upon full build-out of any of the
redevelopment alternatives. The final build-out of the installation is subject to many variables outside of
the Navy's and developer's control, including future market conditions, changes to local and state land
use regulations, and other development factors.

The projected lot area was derived from the size and extent of the proposed land use districts under each
of the three redevelopment alternatives. This figure was then applied to the maximum land coverage for
the corresponding zoning district according the Town of Horsham regulations. This provided a worst-
case amount of impervious surface by land use type, which was then summed to obtain a total amount of
impervious surfaces under Alternatives 1, 2, and 3.

The projected total impervious surface area for each alternative is presented in Tables B-7 to B-9.

Energy Usage Projections
Energy infrastructure at the NAS JRB Willow Grove property includes the supply of electricity and
natural gas. To assess the impacts to these energy supply infrastructures, existing 2010 electricity and
natural gas usages were determined, and compared to the projected usage of these energies at full build
out for all three alternatives.

Existing natural gas usage was found in the 2010 Air Emissions Inventory Report compiled for
compliance with NAS JRB Willow Grove's Title V permit (AECOM 2011). The facility reported the use
of 92,211,409 cubic feet (cf) of natural gas in 2010, primarily used in various boilers, furnaces, and hot
water heaters (AECOM 2011). Electricity usage at the installation is not included in the site's emission
report. Existing building square footage and U.S. averages for energy use per square foot (energy
intensity) obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Agency (EIA) for specific
types of building use (EIA 2003) were used to estimate total annual electricity usage in the existing
buildings (See Table B-10).

     Energy Information Administration, 2003 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption
     Survey

The need for electricity and natural gas infrastructure and supply would be associated with the typical
operation of the proposed residential and commercial buildings under each of the three redevelopment
alternatives. To estimate the electricity and natural gas energy usage that are projected to be needed for
the new buildings, U.S. averages for energy use per square foot from the EIA for specific building types
were applied (EIA 2003, EIA 2009). These averages were used to estimate total energy use by the


Draft EIS                                         B-19                            December 2013
proposed new building spaces, based on the type and size of buildings indicated in, or adapted from the
Redevelopment Plan. It was assumed that commercial emission factors would remain the same and that
new residential buildings would be 30% more efficient, based on the Redevelopment Plan, which
recommends energy efficient housing. The U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Star program suggests
that homes can be 30% more efficient if minimum guidelines are followed (Energy Star 2013).

The following tables present the energy intensity factors (Table B-11) for residential and commercial
uses, as well as how those factors apply to the three redevelopment alternatives (Tables B-12 to B-14).

Introduction
The U.S. Department of the Navy (Navy) has declared approximately 910 acres of property at the former
Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base (NAS-JRB) Willow Grove, in Horsham, Pennsylvania, to be surplus to
the needs of the federal government, in accordance with Public Law 101-510, the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended in 2005 (BRAC Law). As such, the Navy is preparing an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to analyze the potential impacts of the redevelopment of the
surplus property. This Traffic Assessment Study (TAS) presents the existing conditions in the study area
surrounding the former NAS-JRB Willow Grove property and estimates the potential transportation-
related impacts associated with the redevelopment under the three action alternatives being evaluated.
The TAS is a supporting document of the EIS and will provide information to be incorporated into the
EIS's overall analysis.

Background
The former NAS-JRB Willow Grove occupied approximately 910 acres in Horsham Township,
Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The former installation property is located approximately 18 miles
north of Philadelphia. The main gate is located on Easton Road, approximately 2.5 miles north of the
Pennsylvania Turnpike.

The BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure) Commission recommended closure of NAS-JRB Willow Grove
on September 8, 2005. The recommendation to close the installation was approved by President Bush
and accepted by Congress on November 9, 2005. By law, the installation had to be closed before
September 15, 2011. The installation ceased operations and was officially closed on September 15,
2011.

The Navy established the BRAC PMO (Program Management Office) to oversee and manage the
implementation of BRAC actions throughout the Navy. Under BRAC, the Navy acts as the disposal
agency and employs the following procedures: disposal planning and federal transfers (Phase 1), surplus
property notice and designation (Phase 2) and property disposal (Phase 3). Transfer and redevelopment
planning is a multi-phase process, most of which is specified by law.

For NAS-JRB Willow Grove, Phase 1 began on November 9, 2005, when the recommendation to close
the installation became law. The first step in the planning involved offering the properties to federal
agencies for reuse through a federal transfer process. As a result of the federal transfer process,
approximately 48 acres have been or are planned to be transferred from the Navy to the U.S.
Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (3 acres) and U.S. Air Force (45
acres).

Following the federal transfers, the remaining 861 acres of installation property was declared surplus
and made available for reuse. Phase 2 includes the Local Redevelopment Authority's (LRA's)
redevelopment planning. The Horsham Township Authority's (HLRA's) Redevelopment Plan (RKG March


                                                                                                      1
2012) is a critical component of the Navy's environmental analysis required by the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). HLRA is used to describe two different organizations depending on the
time period being discussed. Prior to 2012, the HLRA was the Horsham Township Authority and after
2012, it was the Horsham Land Redevelopment Authority.

After the DOD officially designated the property as surplus, the HRLA began preparation of the
Redevelopment Plan. The NAS-JRB Willow Grove Redevelopment Plan (Redevelopment Plan) (by RKG)
was completed in March 2012 and was officially adopted on March 21, 2012. The Navy's EIS evaluates
the potential redevelopment of the property in a manner consistent with the Redevelopment Plan.

Navy Environmental Impact Statement
The Navy's EIS evaluates three redevelopment alternatives and the No-Action Alternative (No Build).
Alternative 1, the preferred alternative, is the reuse of the property in accordance with the
Redevelopment Plan including mixed land use types and densities, as well as open space and natural
areas. The airfield and most installation facilities would be demolished. Alternative 2 consists of a
higher density of residential development than under Alternative 1, a similar level of mixed-use
development, and demolition of the airfield and most installation facilities. Alternative 3 includes
commercial and mixed-use development, minimal residential development, and conversion of the
military airfield to a general aviation airfield. The No-Action Alternative is the retention of the former
NAS-JRB Willow Grove property by the U.S. government in caretaker status.



Existing Conditions
This section describes the local road network and traffic conditions surrounding the NAS-JRB Willow
Grove. The information presented in this section is based on field investigations, as well as the NAS-JRB
Willow Grove Redevelopment Plan dated March 2012 prepared by RKG. Transit information was
compiled from Southeast Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA).


Road Network and Access
NAS-JRB Willow Grove is located between Horsham Road (SR [State Route] 463), Easton Road (SR 611),
County Line Road and Keith Valley Road in Horsham Township. A description of the principal roadways
and intersections in the vicinity of the former Base are included below.




                                                                                                        2
The Label ID "TMC" represents the location of a Turning Movement Count.

The Label ID "ATR" represents the location of an Automatic Traffic Recorder.




Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 276). The primary regional highway serving the area is the
Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 276), with Exit 343 approximately 2.5 miles south of the Base. The
Turnpike serves Horsham Township by providing connections to I-95 to the east and I-76 and I-476 in
the west.

Easton Road (SR 611). This predominantly four-lane undivided major arterial highway traverses the area
in a generally north-south direction, connecting the area to Philadelphia, where the roadway becomes

                                                                                                    3
Broad Street. There are two-way center left turn lanes throughout the length of Easton Road in the area
of the Base. The traffic movements at the major intersections are controlled by traffic signals. There is
a mix of commercial and non-commercial uses along Easton Road.

Horsham Road (Route 463). This multi-lane major arterial undivided highway connects to areas in the
north such as Allentown. Horsham Road traverses the study area in a northwesterly-southeasterly
direction. There are two-way center left turn lanes along the length of Horsham Road in the area of the
Base. Traffic movements are controlled by traffic signals at the major intersections. The area has mixed
land uses such as Hatboro-Horsham High School, Commonwealth Corporate Center and National
Country Club and the Horsham Township Municipal Complex.

County Line Road. County Line Road is a multi-lane major arterial undivided highway that connects
Keith Valley Road with Easton Road (SR 611). There are turn lanes and shoulders in this area. There are
commercial uses along this portion of the corridor.

Keith Valley Road. Keith Valley Road is an undivided single lane in each direction roadway connecting
County Line Road with Horsham Road. There are minimal shoulders and very sparse land uses.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Turning movement counts (TMCs) were performed on Tuesday, May 7, 2013 through Thursday, May 9,
2013 at the following locations during the peak periods of 7:00 AM to 9: 00 AM and 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM:

    * Note: Intersection #9 does not currently exist. It is a proposed intersection that would provide
    access to the former installation property under Alternatives 1 and 2 only. Therefore, information
    pertaining to Intersection #9 is not presented for existing conditions or under Alternative 3.


Traffic volumes were summarized to determine the AM and PM peak hours. The system AM peak hour
was determined to be 7:15 AM to 8:15 AM. The PM peak hour was 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM. The existing
AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. May is a
typical month for traffic with schools in session.

Automatic Traffic Recorders (ATRs) were placed at the following locations to collect 24-hour traffic
volumes from Monday, May 6 through Monday, May 13, 2013:

   ATR-1 (S): Easton Road ­ (southbound) north of the I-276 interchange
   ATR-1 (N): Easton Road ­ (northbound) north of the I-276 interchange
   ATR-2 (SE): Horsham Road ­ (eastbound) between Privet Road and the High School
   ATR-2 (NW): Horsham Road ­ (westbound) between Privet Road and the High School
   ATR-3 (SE): Easton Road ­ (southbound) between Maple Avenue and Meetinghouse Road
   ATR-3 (NW): Easton Road ­ (northbound) between Maple Avenue and Meetinghouse Road


The ATR data confirmed that the peak traffic hours vary from location to location. The daily traffic
volumes from the ATR data are provided in the appendix.

    Intersection Level of Service
    Capacity analyses were conducted for the study intersections to determine the ability of these
    intersections to accommodate traffic volumes. Level of Service (LOS) is characterized as a qualitative
    measure based on the calculated sum of average vehicle delay for each lane group of an intersection.
    The Levels of Service range from A (short delay) to F (extreme delay). This study analyzed the AM and
    PM peak hour operations for 14 of the intersections listed above. The analyses are based on the
    Transportation Research Board's (TRB) fifth edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2010),
    Chapter 18: Signalized Intersections and Chapter 19: Two-Way Stop-Controlled Intersections for the
    unsignalized intersections.

    The table below presents the Intersection Level of Service and the Intersection Delay for the AM and PM
    peak hour. However, this is only a summary and for a more comprehensive presentation of the LOS and
    Average Vehicle Delay for the individual lane groups, refer to Table 1.

    Safety Conditions
    A summary of vehicle accidents was requested from the Horsham Police Department from the period of
    January 1, 2010 to July 11, 2013 for the following roadways near NAS-JRB Willow Grove and their
    associated intersections:

             Horsham Road (SR 463)
             Keith Valley Road

                                                                                                          7
       Easton Road (SR 611)
       County Line Road

There were 266 accidents reported near NAS JRB Willow Grove during this time period. The majority of
accidents reported (233) took place at an intersection. A total of 237 accidents were recorded on
Horsham Road for this time period. Sixty-three occurred in 2010, 71 in 2011, 65 in 2012 and 38 have
been recorded in 2013 as of July 11, 2013. Of these, 92 accidents involved an injury or vehicle towing
and were reported to PennDOT (Pennsylvania Department of Transportation). The intersection of
Horsham Road and Norristown Road had a total of 37 accidents. The intersection of Horsham Road and
Maple Road recorded 33 accidents and the intersection of Horsham Road and Dresher Road had 30
accidents during this time period. Easton Road experienced ten accidents during this time period. Of
these, four involved injury or vehicle towing and were reportable to PennDOT. Three accidents occurred
in 2010, one in 2011, four in 2012 and two in 2013. Keith Valley Road experienced 14 accidents. Six of
these involved injury or vehicle towing and were reported to PennDOT. The intersection of Keith Valley
Road and Graeme Park Road had five reported accidents. Three accidents occurred in 2010, two in
2011, nine in 2012. A total of five accidents were recorded on Keith Valley Road, three of which
involved injury or vehicle towing and were reported to PennDOT. Three accidents occurred in 2010, and
two in 2012 (Horsham Township Police Department 2013).

Future Conditions
No-Action Condition
It was assumed that the entire project would be completed in 20 years or the year 2033. Population
growth projections, developed by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) for
Montgomery County and Horsham Township, were used to extrapolate traffic growth to the year 2033.
The total projected population growth between the year 2010 and 2035 is 20%. Assuming an equal
growth rate per year, a conservative growth rate of 17% over the 20-year period from 2013 to 2033.
The annual rate of 0.735% was compounded annually from the year 2013 to the year 2033. The Growth
Factors for September 2012 to July 2013 provided by PennDOT (Appendix G) shows an annual growth
factor for Urban Non-Interstates in Montgomery County of 0.73%, which is similar to the growth factor
developed by DVRPC. This annually compounded growth factor of 1.17 was applied to the existing 2013
traffic volumes to develop the future year 2033 No-Action traffic volumes. This background growth
factor accounts for other unknown developments in the area that would generate additional traffic
along the study area roadways. No specific developments in the area were identified.

PennDOT recommends that the growth factors not be used to project traffic beyond a 20-year
period. The redevelopment of the former installation is anticipated to occur over a 20-year
period. PennDOT policies recommend analyzing traffic at the design horizon year; defined as five years
after the opening year of the development (full build-out). However, the redevelopment of the
installation would be dictated by market conditions and it could occur more rapidly during certain time
periods. Based upon the long-term redevelopment of the former installation property, the 20-year
application of the PennDOT growth factors, and that the majority of the redevelopment would occur in
the first 15 years of redevelopment, the analysis was conducted for the 20-year build-out conditions.

    Transportation Future Build Conditions
    This section summarizes the potential transportation impacts resulting from implementing Alternative 1,
    Alternative 2 or Alternative 3 compared to the No-Action condition. The projected traffic volumes and
    subsequent LOS results are summarized in figures and tables. Mitigation measures are described.

    Redevelopment Alternatives
    The three redevelopment alternatives considered in this analysis provide for a mix of land uses.
    Alternatives 1 and 2 are versions of the HLRA's Redevelopment Plan, which do not include reuse of the
    existing airfield. Alternative 3 includes reuse of the airfield along with a mix of commercial, retail and
    recreation/open space. The table below and subsequent figure shows the general location of land uses
    and build environment being proposed under the three redevelopment alternatives.

No-Action Alternative
Analysis of the No-Action Alternative is required by NEPA and includes the former NAS-JRB Willow Grove
property remaining in caretaker status and no redevelopment would take place. However, for the
purposes of the traffic assessment study, there would still be regional population growth. Therefore,
the No-Action Alternative is covered under the Future No-Action Condition.

                                                                                                                    12
Trip Distribution ­ Future Conditions
The trip distribution was based on best professional judgment combined with the land uses in the area,
existing traffic volumes, roadway network configuration, as well as the layout of the proposed
development of the site, the proximity to each access driveway and proximity to major roadways.

Trip Generation ­ Future Conditions
Trip generation values were calculated for each proposed land use based on the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE), 8th Edition of Trip Generation. This is an industry standard for calculating
traffic generation associated with development based on nationwide statistics for each land use (i.e.,
number of housing units by type, non-residential square footage by type, etc.). A comparison of the 8th
Edition of the Trip Generation was made with the 9th Edition. The result was that only the Retail trip
generation calculations changed in the 9th Edition. The AM peak hour trips were 4% less than the 8th
Edition and the PM peak hour retail trips were 6% greater than the 8th Edition. Distributing these
additional trips over the various study intersections would result in an insignificant difference in traffic
volumes. Therefore, the 8th Edition Trip Generation values were used in the study.

Internal Trip Capture Rate Calculation
Internal trip capture is a situation where each land use with a multi-use development would attract trips
from other complementary land uses within the entire development. That is to say that a certain
predictable percentage of residents who would live in the proposed development, would also shop at
the retail uses and the reverse would also apply. Based on the guidelines of the Trip Generation
Handbook, the internal trip capture percentages were calculated for the PM peak hour. Tables 4.1, 4.2
and 4.3 in the appendix provide the calculations for each of the alternative development scenarios. The
overall internal capture percentage was applied to the total new trips to reduce the PM peak hour new
trips to the roadway network and better reflect the future traffic conditions.




                                                                                                         13
Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative) ­ HLRA Plan
To be conservative, the PM peak hour internal capture rate of 23% was applied to both the AM and PM
peak hour trips. At full build-out, Alternative 1 is projected to result in 2,820 new vehicle trips in the AM
peak hour and 3,719 new vehicle trips in the PM peak hour. Traffic volumes increase throughout the
study network. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the new trips for the AM peak hour and the PM peak hour for
Alternative 1, respectively.

Roadway Network and Access ­ Alternative 1
For analysis purposes, it was assumed that Alternative 1 provides seven access points to connect the
new development with the existing roadway network; three on Horsham Road (at approximately
Intersection #s 4, 5, and 7), three on Easton Road (approximately Intersection #s 12, 13, and 14) and one
on Keith Valley Road (at approximately Intersection #9). The major access points connect to existing
signalized intersections, form a T-intersection or form the fourth leg of an existing T-intersection.

Projected Traffic Volumes ­ Alternative 1
Table 2.1 summarizes the trip generation for each of the various land uses of Alternative 1, which are
made up of residential units, commercial space and other land uses. The Institute of Transportation,
Engineers (ITE), Trip Generation, 8th Edition was used to calculate the new trips associated with each
land use. Alternative 1 has a combination of 1,486 units of various housing types, including single family
homes, townhomes/condominiums, and congregate-care retirement community independent living and
assisted living nursing units. The commercial land uses include 1,830,182 SF of a mix of office, office
park and medical office, hotel/conference center, town center retail/services/restaurants,
movies/entertainment. The trips generated by the proposed retail space would have a component
called "pass-by," which means that traffic already driving along the existing roadway network would be
drawn into the retail uses. The new trips of the proposed school of 1,200 students were also calculated.
It was assumed that the trips associated with the proposed Aviation Museum would not be generated
within the AM or PM peak hour of the adjacent street, but rather would occur during the off-peak hours.

Projected Level of Service ­ Alternative 1
The LOS, Average Vehicle Delay and Volume to Capacity ratios are summarized in Table 3.1 for each lane
group of each intersection in the study area. Table 3.1 shows a side-by-side comparison of the Future
No-Action and Alternative 1 Build conditions. In many cases, the background growth applied to the
existing traffic volumes creates a LOS F. The increase in traffic from the proposed development makes
these LOS F worse and creates additional movements at already unacceptable LOS.

Alternative 2 ­ HLRA Plan with Increased Residential Development
To be conservative, the PM peak hour internal capture rate of 28% was applied to both the AM and PM
peak hour trip generation. At full build-out, Alternative 2 is projected to result in 2,817 new vehicle trips
in the AM peak hour and 3,592 new vehicle trips in the PM peak hour. Traffic volumes increase
throughout the study network. Figures 9 and 10 illustrate the new trips for the AM peak hour and the
PM peak hour for Alternative 2, respectively.

Roadway Network and Access ­ Alternative 2
Alternative 2 provides seven access points to connect the new development with the existing roadway
network; three on Horsham Road (at approximately Intersection #s 4, 5, and 7), three on Easton Road
(at approximately Intersection #s 12, 13, and 14) and one on Keith Valley Road (at approximately
Intersection # 9). The major access points connect to existing signalized intersections or form the fourth
leg of an existing T-intersection.

Projected Traffic Volumes ­ Alternative 2
Table 2.2 summarizes the trip generation for each of the various land uses of Alternative 2, which are
made up of residential units, commercial space and other land uses. The Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE), Trip Generation, 8th Edition was used to calculate the new trips associated with each
land use. Alternative 2 has a combination of 1,999 units of various housing types, including single family
homes, townhomes/condominiums, and congregate care retirement community independent living and
assisted living nursing units. The commercial land uses include 1,798,750 SF of a mix of office, office
park and medical office, hotel/conference center, town center retail/services/restaurants,
movies/entertainment. A school with 1,200 students is also proposed in Alternative 2. Once again, the
Aviation Museum trips were assumed to occur during the off-peak hours.

Projected Level of Service ­ Alternative 2
The LOS, Average Vehicle Delay and Volume to Capacity ratios are summarized in Table 3.2 for each lane
group of each intersection in the study area. Table 3.2 shows a side-by-side comparison of the No-
Action and Build conditions.

Alternative 3 ­ Airfield Reuse
To be conservative, the PM peak hour internal capture rate of 12% was applied to the AM and PM peak
hour trip generation. At full build-out, Alternative 3 is projected to result in 1,763 new vehicle trips in
the AM peak hour and 2,502 new vehicle trips in the PM peak hour. Traffic volumes increase
throughout the study network. Figures 13 and 14 illustrate the new trips for the AM peak hour and the
PM peak hour, respectively.

Roadway Network and Access ­ Alternative 3
Alternative 2 provides six access points to connect the new development with the existing roadway
network; three on Horsham Road (at approximately Intersection #s 4, 5, and 7), three on Easton Road
(at approximately Intersection #s 12, 13, and 14) and none on Keith Valley Road. The major access
points connect to existing signalized intersections or form the fourth leg of an existing T-intersection.

Projected Traffic Volumes ­ Alternative 3
Table 2.3 summarizes the trip generation for each of the various land uses of Alternative 3, which are
made up of residential units, commercial space and other land uses. The Institute of Transportation,
Trip Generation, 8th Edition was used to calculate the new trips associated with each land use.
Alternative 3 has no residential units other than the 70 units of housing for the homeless. The
commercial land uses include a mix of 1,214,693 SF of office park, hotel/conference center, and retail
space. There is no school contemplated for this alternative development scenario. Once again, the
Aviation Museum traffic would occur outside of the AM and PM peak hours of the adjacent streets. The
Airfield Operations was used treated as an office use with 351 employees (of which it is assumed 176
employees [or 50%] would commute during peak hours).

Projected Level of Service ­ Alternative 3
The LOS, Average Vehicle Delay and Volume to Capacity ratios are summarized in Table 3.3 for each lane
group of each intersection in the study area. Table 3.3 shows a side-by-side comparison of the No-

Traffic Impact Mitigation Measures ­ Build Alternatives 1, 2 and 3
All traffic impact mitigation measures require appropriate traffic signal timing and phasing modifications
to accommodate the lane configuration modifications. The proposed mitigation at the intersections
analyzed in this study are described below and the Proposed Mitigation Measures appendix provides
arrow depictions for new turning and through lanes. Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 compare the Future
Conditions (No-Action) to Alternatives 1, 2 and 3, respectively, both without and with the mitigation
noted below.

Easton Road with Horsham Road (Intersection #1):

An additional northbound through lane, an additional southbound through lane and a double left for the
southbound approach would result in a slight improvement; however, these approaches would still
operate at LOS F. The Horsham Road leg of the intersection must be widened by one lane to accept the
southbound double left turn traffic.

Easton Road with Horsham Road (Intersection #2):

A third right turn lane for the eastbound approach and an additional through lane for the southbound
approach are recommended to improve the operations of this intersection. Southbound Easton Road
must be widened to three lanes to accept the traffic from the three right turn lanes from eastbound
Horsham Road. These improvements provide enough capacity to bring the LOS back to the No-Action
conditions.

Horsham Road with Dresher Road (Intersection #3):

In order to improve the traffic operational impacts of the development traffic, an additional through
lane is recommended for the eastbound, westbound, and southbound approaches. The northbound left
turn should be widened to accommodate a double left turn lane. The departure lanes of the east, west
and south legs of the intersection must be widened to accept the additional through lanes. The LOS is
improved with these mitigation measures, comparable to those of the No-Action LOS.

Horsham Road with Maple Avenue (Intersection #4):

The eastbound left turn lane should be a double left turn lane. The northbound approach should be a
separate left turn and a shared through-right lane. To improve the capacity of the southbound
approach, the southbound right turn should be reconfigured so that the right turn lane traffic can turn
right on red.

Horsham Road and Norristown Road (Intersection #5):

The new access roadway would form the fourth leg of the intersection. The configuration of this
southbound leg of the intersection would be one exclusive left turn lane, one through lane and one right
turn lane with two lanes entering the site. The westbound approach would require a second left turn
lane, resulting in the need to widen the southbound departure lanes of Norristown Road to two lanes.
The westbound approach would also benefit from an exclusive right turn lane to enter the site. The

                                                                                                       20
eastbound approach would require a double left turn to enter the site and an exclusive right turn lane
for traffic turning to Norristown Road. The northbound approach would require one exclusive left turn
lane, one through lane and one right turn lane.

Easton Road with Home Depot Drive/I-276 Ramps (Intersection #6):

The southbound approach and departure would require an additional through lane to accommodate the
additional site generated traffic.

Horsham Road with Privet Road (Intersection #7):

The proposed site driveway would consist of three lanes; an exclusive left turn lane, a through lane and
an exclusive right turn lane. The recommended improvement to this intersection is to develop a
northbound right turn lane that allows traffic to flow freely onto eastbound Horsham Road. This
improves the capacity of that movement.

Horsham Road with Keith Valley Road (Intersection #8):

An additional through lane for the eastbound and westbound approaches of Horsham Road is
recommended. The eastbound approach should provide an exclusive right turn lane to accommodate
the second eastbound through lane. The eastbound and westbound departure legs should be widened
to accommodate the additional through lane.

Keith Valley Road and New Access Road (Intersection #9):

Based on the results of the traffic analyses, the proposed intersection of Graeme Park Road with Keith
Valley Road would consist of one lane in each direction along Keith Valley Road and one single entering
and one single lane exiting the proposed site access on Graeme Park Road.

County Line Road with Keith Valley Road (Intersection #10):

A northbound through lane is recommended on Keith Valley Road. The northern leg of Kansas Road
would need to be widened to two northbound lanes to accommodate the additional through lane.

County Line Road with Easton Road (Intersection #11):

A northbound Easton Road double left turn lane configuration is recommended to mitigation poor LOS.
An additional exclusive through lane for all four approaches is also recommended to mitigate some of
the traffic impacts.

Easton Road with Gate 1 (Intersection #12):

Improvements to the Gate 1 exiting movements would include double left turn lanes and an exclusive
right turn lane with two lanes entering the site. The southbound approach of Easton Road should be
widened to accommodate an additional through lane. The southbound departure of Easton Road
should also be widened to accommodate the additional southbound through lane.


                                                                                                     21
Easton Road with W Moreland Road (unsignalized) (Intersection #13):

A traffic signal will be required to accommodate the traffic demand at this intersection. The fourth leg
of the intersection is the driveway accessing the redevelopment. A northbound left turn lane on Easton
Road would be proposed.

Easton Road with Maple Avenue (Lower) (Intersection #14):

An additional northbound left turn lane and an additional northbound through lane are recommended
as well as double left lanes and one shared through-right lane for Maple Avenue approach. The
northbound departure must be widened to accommodate the additional northbound through lane. One
lane entering the site and one lane exiting the site is proposed. The Maple Avenue (Lower) roadway
would be two lanes entering the site and three lanes exiting the site. Upper Maple Avenue is just north
of Lower Maple Avenue intersection and is the east leg of the "T" intersection.

Easton Road with Dresher Road /Meetinghouse Road (Intersection #15):

An additional through lane on Easton Road northbound and south bound is recommended to
accommodate the additional site generated traffic. The departure lanes of southbound and northbound
Easton Road also would be widened to accommodate the additional through lane.

NOTE: The projected growth factors are derived using historical VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) data (1994 to 2011), as well as Woods and
Poole demographic and economic data. The factors should not be used to project traffic beyond a 20-year period. Please be aware that these
factors are estimates, and unforeseen events (opening of shopping centers, fast food franchises, gas stations, etc) could cause growth to
change over time.

                  CLEAN AIR ACT CONFORMITY

                   DISPOSAL AND REUSE OF FORMER
                       NAS JRB WILLOW GROVE
                      HORSHAM, PENNSYLVANIA


Action Proponent: United States Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering
Command Base Realignment and Program Management Office, East (BRAC PMO East)

Location: Former NAS JRB Willow Grove, Horsham, Pennsylvania

Proposed Action Name: Transfer of Property for the Disposal and Reuse of Former NAS JRB
Willow Grove

Summary: This Record of Non-Applicability (RONA) documents the Navy's determination that
the requirement to make a Clean Air Act conformity determination does not apply to the
Proposed Action because the Proposed Action fits within one or more of the exemptions at 40
CFR 93.153.

Regulatory Background: Pursuant to Section 176 of the Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) published Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to
State or Federal Implementation Plans; Final Rule, in the 30 November 1993, Federal Register
(General Conformity Rule, 40 CFR Parts 6, 51, and 93, as amended). These implementing
regulations state that no department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government shall
engage in, support in any way or provide financial assistance for, license or permit, or approve
any activity that does not conform to an applicable implementation plan (40 CFR Part
93.150[a]). It is the responsibility of the Federal agency to determine whether a Federal action
conforms to the applicable implementation plan before the action is taken (40 CFR Part
93.150[b]).

A federal action is exempt from the requirement to make a conformity determination if the action
fits within one of the categories of actions identified at 40 CFR 93.153(c)(2) that have been
deemed by U.S. EPA to result in no emissions increase or an increase in emissions that is clearly
de minimis. Federal actions may also be exempt from conformity determinations if they do not
exceed designated de minimis levels for criteria pollutants (40 CFR Part 51.853[b]).

The U.S. Navy published Clean Air Act Conformity Guidance in OPNAVINST 5090.1C,
Appendix F, dated 30 October 2007 (OPNAVINST). This RONA has been prepared pursuant to
the OPNAVINST.
Description of the Proposed Action:
The proposed action is the disposal of the former NAS JRB Willow Grove property by the Navy
and its subsequent reuse by the local redevelopment authority (LRA). Three action alternatives
for reuse of the surplus property and the No Action Alternative were evaluated. The preferred
reuse alternative (Alternative 1) is use of the surplus property consistent with the NAS JRB
Willow Grove prepared and adopted by the LRA. Alternative 2 is redevelopment of the property
with a more dense mixture of land uses. Alternative 3 is redevelopment of the property as an
airfield.

Applicability Exemption Categories:
The requirement to prepare a conformity determination does not apply to a federal action if the
action fits within one or more of the exemption categories at 40 CFR 93.153(c)(2). The
Proposed Action fits within one or more of the exemption categories described below:

(xiv) Transfers of ownership, interests, and titles in land, facilities, and real and personal
properties, regardless of the form or method of transfer

Per BRAC recommendations, following prescribed documentation and studies, the Navy will
transfer the former NAS JRB Willow Grove property out of federal-ownership to the LRA for
future redevelopment.

More generally, in the preamble to the General Conformity Rule, U.S. EPA stated "Under the
exclusive definition of indirect emissions, Federal land transfers are unlikely to be covered since
the Federal agency will not maintain authority over reuse activities on that land. Consequently,
Federal land transfers are included in the regulatory list of actions that will not exceed the de
minimis levels and are thus exempt from the conformity rules." 58 Fed. Reg. 63231 (1993). The
Proposed Action fits squarely within the actions U.S. EPA intended to exempt from the
conformity requirement.

Evaluation Against De Minimis Air Emissions Conformity Thresholds:
Although the Proposed Action would be exempted under one of the exemption categories at 40
CFR 93.153(c)(2), the Navy nevertheless evaluated projected emissions from the Proposed
Action against the de minimis thresholds for the Philadelphia-Wilmington Air Control Region in
order to understand and better quantify the potential impacts from the action. The details of that
evaluation are included as Attachment 1 to the RONA. The evaluation demonstrated that the de
minimis thresholds for applicable criteria pollutants would not be exceeded as a result of
implementation of the Proposed Action.

CONCLUSION
The Proposed Action is Transfer of Property and subsequent Disposal and Reuse of Former NAS
JRB Willow Grove. Reuse of the property would result in indirect air impacts from the
construction and operation of the facility. The Proposed Action fits within one or more of the
exemptions from the requirement to prepare a conformity determination found at 40 CFR
93.153(c)(2). The Navy also performed an evaluation of the projected emissions from the
Proposed Action as against the de minimis thresholds for the Philadelphia-Wilmington Air
Control Region, which is in moderate nonattainment for the 8-hour ozone standard, and basic
nonattainment for both the 1997 and 2006 PM 2.5 standards. In addition, Pennsylvania as a
whole is included in the North East Ozone Transport Region (U.S. EPA 2013b, U.S. EPA
2013c). The Navy concluded that emissions thresholds would not be exceeded, nor would
projected emissions be regionally significant, meaning the Proposed Action would also fit within
the exemption at 40 CFR 93.153(c)(1). Therefore, on the basis of the foregoing, the Navy
concludes that the Clean Air Act Conformity Determination requirements do not apply to the
Proposed Action, resulting in this Record of Non Applicability.

                ATTACHMENT 1 ­ DE MINIMIS THRESHOLDS EVALUATION

The Philadelphia-Wilmington Air Control Region is in moderate nonattainment for the 8-hour
ozone standard and basic nonattainment for both the 1997 and 2006 PM 2.5 standards. In
addition, Pennsylvania as a whole is included in the North East Ozone Transport Region (U.S.
EPA 2013b, U.S. EPA 2013c).

 Notes:

   GCR determinations are based on federal attainment designations. All air pollutants that are taken into consideration for
   maintenance of federal standards do not have a de minimis threshold.

 Key:
  GCR      =   General Conformity Rule
   N/A     =   Not Applicable
   NOX     =   oxides of nitrogen
  PM10     =   particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microns
  PM2.5    =   particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 microns
  VOC      =   volatile organic compounds

The Proposed Action would not have a direct impact on air quality or greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. However, execution of the transfer of the former NAS JRB Willow Grove property
would indirectly create air quality emissions related to construction and operation of the
proposed redevelopment. Tables 2 and 3 provide a summary of calculations as detailed in the
EIS and Appendix D and comparison to conformity de minimis levels.

  Totals may be different than sum of numbers in column due to rounding.
2
  GCR determinations are based on federal attainment designations. All air pollutants that are taken into consideration for
  maintenance of federal standards do not have a de minimis threshold.

In summary, no material change in operational emissions is projected to result from the Proposed
Action, and an increase in emissions over either the No Action Alternative or existing conditions,
if any, would be below the conformity determination de minimis thresholds.

Notes:
a. Emission factors for gasoline worker vehicles from "Emission Facts: Average Annual Emissions and Fuel Consumption for Gasoline-Fueled Passenger Cars and Light
Trucks (EPA420-F-08-024, EPA 2008). It was assumed that the vehicle make-up included 50% cars and 50% light-duty trucks/SUVs. SO2 emission factor calculated from
gasoline consumption rate and a sulfur content of 80 ppm.
b. Emission factors for diesel worker and delivery vehicles (except SO2 and CO2) from "Assessing the Effects of Freight Movement on Air Quality at the National and
Regional Level- Final Report" (U.S. Federal Highway Administration 2005).
c. CO2 and SO 2 emission factors for diesel worker and delivery vehicles from "Greenhouse Gas Protocol - Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard / Mobile Guide"
(World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development 2005). SO2 emission factor calculated from diesel consumption rate and a sulfur content of
348 ppm.
d. See emission factor derivation table below.
e. Sum of exhaust and road dust emission factors.

Introduction
Day-night average sound level (DNL) noise contours were modeled using the Federal Aviation
Administration's (FAA's) Integrated Noise Model (INM) version 7.0d. The modeling was performed as
part of the environmental consequences analysis for Alternative 3 at the former NAS JRB Willow Grove
installation.

INM 7.0d, which was released in May 2013, is planned to be the final version of this program before
INM is replaced by the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) in 2014. This version of INM
does not incorporate any significant computational improvements over earlier versions; however, some
databases have been updated. Some of the factors considered in the noise model include:

            ·   Type of operation (e.g., arrival, departure, pattern);
            ·   Number of operations per day of aircraft types;
            ·   Time of operation;
            ·   Flight tracks;
            ·   Aircraft power settings, speeds, and altitudes;
            ·   Number, duration, power setting, and heading of maintenance run-ups; and
            ·   Environmental data (temperature and humidity).

Two scenarios were modeled: (1) 2010 Baseline Conditions, which included military fixed-wing and
rotary-wing aircraft, general aviation (GA) fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, and military ground run-
ups; and (2) 2034 Projected Conditions, which included only GA fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft.

The following describes the major elements of the model and any adjustments/approximations made.

Study Aircraft

Military fixed-wing: A-10A, C-12, P-3C, C-130E, C-9A, C-17, and F/A-18

Military rotary-wing: CH-53E (INM substitute used is a S65), UH-1N (INM substitute used is a B212),
AH-1W

General Aviation fixed-wing: GASEPV, BEC58P, Lear 60 (INM substitute used is a CNA55B), EMB145

General Aviation rotary-wing: SA350D

Study Parameters
Standard day temperature (59 degrees Fahrenheit [F]) and pressure (29.92 inches of mercury [in-Hg])
were used in the model along with a headwind of 8 knots (standard in INM). INM permits just these
three values as weather/atmospheric inputs, not monthly data. In comparison, actual historical monthly
data for NAS JRB Willow Grove, which was considered for input to the model, had an average
temperature, over a 12-month period, of 52 degrees F; a single barometric pressure data point of 29.8 in-
Hg was recorded from actual data. Use of the standard day values proved to be a reasonable estimate for
the weather conditions at NAS JRB Willow Grove; running the model with 52 degrees F and 29.8 in-Hg
produced no significant changes in the contours, compared with those run with standard day values.

Flight Tracks
Sixty-two flight tracks were measured and formatted for use with INM. The INM tracks have a close
resemblance to the original tracks depicted in the 1999 Air Installations Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ)
Study for NAS JRB Willow Grove (The Onyx Group 1999). Minor modifications were made to the GCA
Box flight tracks 15G1, 15G4, 33G1, and 33G4 to get these to close completely, a requirement of INM.
Figure E-1 presents representative arrival and departure flight tracks adapted from the 1999 AICUZ and
used for modeling the existing environment noise conditions; Figure E-2 presents the representative
pattern (i.e., touch-and-go and GCA Box pattern) flight tracks used in the noise model.

Flight Profiles
Custom flight profiles for arrivals and departures were used for the military fixed-wing flight profiles
instead of the Noisemap standard profiles (which are available in INM). These custom profiles are
commonly used in noise modeling to support Navy AICUZ studies and other studies for the military,
because they have been generated more recently and, in some cases, are believed to be more
representative of typical flight operations than the standard profiles. INM runs were conducted using both
sets of profiles, and no significant differences were noted in the DNL contours. This is because neither
scenario involves a large number of flight operations, and the noise contours of interest (60 to 80 DNL)
are located close to the airfield. Noise differences between the custom and standard flight profiles would
be more noticeable farther away from the airfield, where there would be a wider spread between these two
types of profiles.

INM does not have the capability to model touch-and-go patterns for rotary-wing aircraft; therefore, all
pattern operations for military and GA rotary-wing aircraft were distributed onto arrivals and departures
that have track turn points located as close as possible to where the touch-and-go pattern turns are located.
This is one example of an operations adjustment that was necessary due to INM limitations. However,
touch-and-go operation numbers were small in the overall mix of operations, so it is expected that no
significant changes to the noise results occurred due to these adjustments. Furthermore, the DNL
contours of interest (60 to 80 DNL) are located close to the airfield, where the influence of the touch-and-
go patterns tends to diminish, and a potential effect would be more noticeable for the outer contours (55
DNL and lower).

INM standard flight profiles were used for all GA fixed-wing aircraft.

Flight Operations
The flight operations are described in detail in the Tables E-1 through E-6. Some of the important
modeling assumptions made for the purpose of this analysis are also noted below.

The 2010 military fixed-wing aircraft operations are based on the same percentage distribution of
operations as indicated in the 1999 AICUZ Study (The Onyx Group 1999). Raw control tower operations
data were assigned to the military aircraft types using this percentage distribution, which was also applied
to the military rotary-wing operations.

The 2010 and 2034 GA aircraft operations and day/night splits were assigned based on typical
percentages for GA airports (95 percent daytime to 5 percent nighttime).

Single Engine Maintenance Run-Up Operations
Maintenance run-ups were modeled for all the aircraft types indicated in the 1999 AICUZ Study (The
Onyx Group 1999). The run-up operations used for 2010 were scaled down from those represented in the
AICUZ Study to reflect the decrease in military flight operations from 1999 to 2010. This scaling was
done separately for each aircraft type; however, the scaling resulted in essentially the same effect for all
aircraft types (i.e., the 2010 military flight operations are 23.5 percent of the 1999 military flight

operations, and this percentage applies to all military aircraft). Therefore, the 2010 military aircraft run-
up operations represent 23.5 percent of the 1999 military aircraft run-ups.

It is likely that some GA run-ups will occur in 2034, but no readily available information exists on
location, schedule, etc.; therefore, no GA run-up operations were modeled.

                       The U.S. Department of the Navy is preparing an Environmental Impact State-
                       ment (EIS) to evaluate the disposal and reuse of Naval Air Station Joint Reserve
                       Base Willow Grove, in Horsham, Pennsylvania. The installation ceased opera-
                       tions and was officially closed in September 2011 under the Defense Base Clo-
                       sure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended in 2005 (BRAC Closure Law).
                       To support preparation of the EIS, a wetland delineation was conducted on ap-
                       proximately 860 acres of the former installation in April and May of 2013.

                       The wetland delineation identified and mapped 23 wetland features encompassing
                       a total of 25.96 acres. Drainage features associated with the wetlands, including
                       both man-made features such as culverts and ditches and naturally occurring fea-
                       tures such as seeps and streams, were also mapped. A total of 6,738.99 feet of
                       linear features were mapped.

1   Introduction

    The U.S. Department of the Navy (Navy) has closed Naval Air Station Joint Re-
    serve Base (NAS JRB) Willow Grove in accordance with Public Law 101-510,
    the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended in 2005
    (BRAC Closure Law). NAS JRB Willow Grove is located in Horsham Township,
    Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, approximately 18 miles north of Philadelph-
    ia. The main gate is located on Easton Road approximately 2.5 miles north of the
    Pennsylvania Turnpike (see Figure 1-1).

    The site of NAS JRB Willow Grove was originally a municipal airfield construct-
    ed in the mid-1930s. The Navy acquired the airfield in response to World War II,
    and NAS Willow Grove was commissioned in January 1943. After World War II
    ended in 1945, the installation was designated a Reserve Training Station. In
    1994, the installation was re-designated a Joint Reserve Base to more accurately
    reflect its status. The mission of NAS JRB Willow Grove prior to closure was to
    provide, train, and maintain a ready reserve force for the country.

    The BRAC Commission recommended closure of NAS JRB Willow Grove on
    September 8, 2005. The recommendation to close NAS JRB Willow Grove was
    approved by President Bush and accepted by Congress on November 9, 2005. By
    law, the installation had to be closed before September 15, 2011. The installation
    ceased operations and was officially closed in September 2011. The Navy intends
    to dispose of the installation property based on the recommendation of the BRAC
    Commission to close the installation. As part of the disposal process, the Hors-
    ham Township Authority (HLRA 2) for NAS JRB Willow Grove was formed as
    the entity responsible for preparing the Redevelopment Plan with respect to the
    installation (RKG 2012). The Navy is preparing an Environmental Impact State-
    ment (EIS) to evaluate the disposal and reuse of NAS JRB Willow Grove.

    This wetland delineation report was prepared to support the Navy's EIS. Field
    reconnaissance surveys were conducted at NAS JRB Willow Grove in April and
    May 2013 to assess the occurrence of wetlands and waterbodies (e.g., streams,
    tributaries, and other major watercourses). Section 2 describes the methods used
    to evaluate wetlands and waterbodies at NAS JRB Willow Grove, and Section 3
    describes the wetlands and waterbodies identified during the reconnaissance field

        In June 2012, the Horsham Township Authority was redesignated as the Horsham Land Rede-
        velopment Authority (HLRA). To avoid confusion, this entity is referred to herein as the
        HLRA.

             visit. The wetland delineation was performed for NEPA planning purposes and to
             identify potential impacts, which will be evaluated in the EIS; therefore, a juris-
             dictional determination (JD) of the wetland boundaries was not conducted. A JD
             will need to be conducted by a developer prior to any redevelopment of the instal-
             lation property.

2   Methodology

    This section describes the definition of wetlands and accepted criteria used to
    identify wetlands at NAS JRB Willow Grove.

    Wetlands are defined as:

           "Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground-
           water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that
           under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation
           typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands
           generally include swamps, bogs, marshes, and similar areas" (40
           Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 232.2).

    The wetland delineation methods used in this study are described in the 1987 U.S.
    Army Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual (Environmental Laborato-
    ry 1987) and the Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Deline-
    ation Manual: Eastern Mountains and Piedmont Region (Version 2.0) (USACE
    2012). According to the wetland delineation manual, to be defined as a wetland
    an area must exhibit evidence of at least one positive wetland indicator from each
    of three parameters, including soils, hydrology, and vegetation (Environmental
    Laboratory 1987). These parameters are described below.

    2.1 Characteristics of Hydric Soils
    The National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils has developed criteria for
    identifying hydric soils and published a list of the nation's hydric soil types. A
    hydric soil is defined as a soil that formed under conditions of saturation, flood-
    ing, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic con-
    ditions in the upper part of the soil profile (USDA NRCS n.d.). The growing sea-
    son is defined as the portion of the year when the soil temperature at 12 inches
    below the soil surface is 41 degrees Fahrenheit (oF) or higher (USACE 2012). If
    the timing of the growing season based on vegetation growth and development
    and/or soil temperature is unknown and on-site data collection is not practical,
    then growing season dates may be approximated by the median dates (i.e., 5 years
    in 10, or a 50 percent probability) of 28 oF air temperatures in spring and fall,
    based on long-term records gathered at National Weather Service meteorological
    stations (USACE 2005). For Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, the growing
    season extends from April 18 through October 15, a period of 180 days (USDA
    NRCS 2002).

                                      2-1                                  June 2013
Final Wetland Delineation Report

             Anaerobic conditions are created when flooding, ponding, or saturation is of suf-
             ficient duration to result in the absence of oxygen from the soil. Such soils usual-
             ly support hydrophytic vegetation. Due to their saturated condition during the
             growing season, hydric soils usually develop certain morphological features that
             can be observed in the field. A prolonged anaerobic environment typically results
             in the accumulation of organic matter and/or lowers the soil reduction-oxidation,
             or redox, potential and causes a chemical reduction of soil components, such as
             iron and manganese oxides. This reduction affects solubility, movement, and ag-
             gregations of these oxides, which are reflected in soil colors (USDA NRCS 2010).

             2.2 Characteristics of Wetland Hydrology
             Permanent or periodic inundation (where soil is saturated within the rooting zone,
             at least seasonally) is the hydrologic force behind wetland formation. The pres-
             ence of water for 5 percent or more of the growing season typically creates an an-
             aerobic condition in the soil, which affects the types of plants that can grow there
             and the types of soils that develop (Environmental Laboratory 1987).

             Factors that influence the wetness of an area include precipitation, stratigraphy
             (i.e., layering), topography and micro-relief, and soil permeability. The water
             found in wetlands may come directly from precipitation and from overbank flood-
             ing, surface water runoff, groundwater discharge, or tidal flooding. The frequen-
             cy and duration of inundation and soil saturation range from permanent flooding
             or saturation to intermittent flooding or saturation. Duration is usually the most
             important factor affecting soils and vegetation. Soil permeability, which is affect-
             ed by soil texture and density, also influences the duration of inundation or soil
             saturation. For example, soils with high clay content generally have lower per-
             meabilities, absorb water more slowly, and therefore remain saturated for a longer
             period of time than sandy or loamy soils (Environmental Laboratory 1987).

             Of the three technical criteria for wetland identification, wetland hydrology is of-
             ten the least exact and most challenging to characterize, primarily because of an-
             nual, seasonal, and daily fluctuations in water level. An area has wetland hydrol-
             ogy when saturated within the rooting zone (usually within 12 inches of the sur-
             face) for at least 5 percent of the growing season (Environmental Laboratory
             1987).

             The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) defines the water table as "the up-
             per surface of groundwater or the level below which the soil is saturated with wa-
             ter. It is at least 6 inches thick and persists in the soil for more than a few weeks"
             (Environmental Laboratory 1987). Field indicators used as evidence of wetland
             hydrology include one or more primary indicator such as surface water, high wa-
             ter table, or saturation. Two or more secondary indicators may also be used as
             evidence of wetland hydrology, such as ordinary high water marks, drift lines,
             drainage patterns, water marks, sediment deposition, vegetation morphology (e.g.,
             adventitious roots), and presence or absence of algae or moss (Environmental La-
             boratory 1987). The Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland De-
             lineation Manual: Eastern Mountains and Piedmont Region (Version 2.0) pro-


                                               2-2                                    June 2013

             vides a complete list of primary and secondary wetland hydrology indicators for
             the region (USACE 2012).

             2.3 Characteristics of Hydrophytic Vegetation
             Hydrophytic vegetation is defined as macrophytic plant life growing in water or
             soil or on a substrate that is at least periodically deficient in oxygen as a result of
             excessive water content (Environmental Laboratory 1987). Vascular plants are
             classified into the following five wetland indicator status groups based on qualita-
             tive ecological descriptions (Lichvar et al. 2012):

              Obligate Wetland (OBL). Almost always occur in wetlands.
              Facultative Wetland (FACW). Usually occur in wetlands, but may occur in
              non-wetlands.
              Facultative (FAC). Occur in wetlands and non-wetlands.
              Facultative Upland (FACU). Usually occur in non-wetlands, but may occur
              in wetlands.
              Obligate Upland (UPL). Almost never occur in wetlands.

             A list of plants able to tolerate saturated soil conditions has been developed for
             the Eastern Mountains and Piedmont Region by the USACE as part of an inter-
             agency effort with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and
             Wildlife Service (USFWS), and U.S. Department of Agriculture - Natural Re-
             sources Conservation Service (USDA NRCS) (Lichvar 2012). The presence of
             hydrophytic vegetation is determined using the wetland indicator status of species
             encountered. Wetland boundaries are identified based on the presence of a wet-
             land plant community rather than on any one particular indicator species. For ex-
             ample, a plant community with scattered individual upland species but dominated
             by hydrophytic species is considered to be a wetland plant community. Within
             each wetland, specific communities are determined on the basis of their dominant
             plant species, soils, and hydrology.

             2.4 Classification
             This section describes the different classes of wetlands and the criteria used to
             classify them. These criteria were used to classify wetlands at NAS JRB Willow
             Grove.

             The wetlands delineated in the study area were classified using the USFWS wet-
             land hierarchical classification system (Cowardin et al. 1979). This system classi-
             fies wetlands according to hydrologic, geomorphologic, chemical, and biological
             factors. Wetlands are first classified by the primary source of water to the wet-
             land. These classes are usually identified by the physical form of the dominant
             vegetation community type or, less often, the substrate of the wetland. The Cow-
             ardin et al. (1979) primary systems are as follows:

              Palustrine Systems are shallow ponds and wet areas, including all non-tidal
              wetlands, dominated by trees, shrubs, persistent emergents, emergent mosses,


                                                2-3                                    June 2013

                 or lichens. This system also includes wetlands lacking such vegetation but
                 with all of the following four characteristics: (1) total area is less than 20
                 acres; (2) active wave-formed or bedrock shoreline features are lacking; (3)
                 water depth in the deepest part of the basin is less than 6.6 feet at low water;
                 and (4) salinity, due to ocean-derived salts, is less than 0.5 part per thousand.
              Lacustrine Systems are lakes and deep ponds and include wetlands and
              deepwater habitats with all of the following characteristics: (1) situated in a
              topographic depression or a dammed river channel; (2) trees, shrubs, persis-
              tent emergents, emergent mosses, or lichens with less than 30 percent aerial
              coverage; and (3) total area exceeds 20 acres. Similar wetland and deepwater
              habitats totaling less than 20 acres are also considered a Lacustrine System if
              an active wave-formed or bedrock shoreline feature makes up all or part of the
              boundary, or if the water depth in the deepest part of the basin exceeds 6.6
              feet at low water. Lacustrine waters may be tidal or non-tidal, but ocean-
              derived salinity is always less than 0.5 parts per thousand.
              Marine Systems consist of open ocean overlying the continental shelf and its
              associated high-energy coastline. Marine habitats are exposed to the waves
              and currents of the open ocean, and the water regimes are determined primari-
              ly by the ebb and flow of oceanic tides. Salinities exceed 30 parts per thou-
              sand, with little or no dilution, except outside the mouths of estuaries. Shal-
              low coastal indentations or bays without appreciable freshwater inflow and
              coasts with exposed rocky islands that provide the mainland with little or no
              shelter from wind and waves are also considered a Marine System because
              they generally support typical marine biota.
              Estuarine Systems consist of deepwater tidal habitats and their adjacent tidal
              wetlands, which are usually semi-enclosed by land but have open, partly ob-
              structed, or sporadic access to the open ocean, and in which ocean water is at
              least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. The salinity
              may periodically increase above that of the open ocean by evaporation. Along
              some low-energy coastlines, there is appreciable dilution of seawater. Off-
              shore areas with typical estuarine plants and animals are also included in this
              system.
              Riverine Systems include all wetlands and deepwater habitats contained
              within a channel, except: (1) wetlands dominated by trees, shrubs, persistent
              emergents, emergent mosses, or lichens; and (2) habitats with water contain-
              ing ocean-derived salts in excess of 0.5 parts per thousand.

             The above systems are then divided into more specific categories, or subsystems,
             although there are no subsystems in the Palustrine System. The classification sys-
             tem further subdivides wetlands into different classes based on general appear-
             ance of the life form in the plant community (e.g., trees, shrubs, aquatic vegeta-
             tion; see Table 2-1). The class Forested Wetland is characterized by woody vege-
             tation that is 19.7 feet or taller and greater than 3 inches in diameter at breast
             height. The class Scrub-Shrub Wetland is dominated by multi-stemmed woody
             vegetation less than 19.7 feet in height. This class includes shrubs, sapling trees,
             and trees that are small or stunted due to environmental conditions. The class

             Emergent Wetland consists of erect, rooted, herbaceous vascular plants and ex-
             cludes mosses and lichens.

             The determination of wetland classes is based on the following criteria: if vegeta-
             tion covers 30 percent or more of the substrate, then the class is distinguished on
             the basis of the life form of the plants that constitutes the uppermost layer of
             vegetation and that possesses an aerial coverage of 30 percent or greater. For ex-
             ample, an area with 50 percent areal coverage of trees over a shrub layer with 60
             percent areal coverage would be classified as Forested Wetland; an area with 20
             percent areal coverage of trees over the same (60 percent) shrub layer would be
             classified as Scrub-Shrub Wetland. When trees or shrubs alone cover less than 30
             percent of an area but in combination cover 30 percent or more, the wetland
             would be assigned to the class Scrub-Shrub Wetland. When trees and shrubs to-
             gether cover less than 30 percent of the area but the total cover of vegetation is 30
             percent or greater, the wetland would be assigned to the appropriate class for the
             predominant life form below the shrub layer.

             Finer differences in life form are recognized at the subclass level. For example,
             during this study, the only Forested Wetland subclass (and its classification code)
             encountered during surveys was "1 ­ Broad-Leaved Deciduous," the only Scrub-
             Shrub Wetland subclass encountered during field surveys was "1 ­ Broad-Leaved
             Deciduous," and the only Emergent Wetland subclass was "1 ­ Persistent."

             2.5 Desktop Data Review
             Prior to engaging in field work, background information was reviewed to famil-
             iarize field personnel with the study area and to assist in the initial identification
             of wetlands and waterbodies. This background information included data from
             the following publicly available sources:

               U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) 7.5-Minute Series topographic maps (Ambler
               and Hatboro Quadrangles) (USGS 1996)
               Current aerial imagery
               USFWS National Wetland Inventory (USFWS 2011)
               USGS National Land Cover Data (Fry et al. 2011)
               USDA Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database (USDA NRCS 2009)
               USDA NRCS WETS table data (USDA NRCS 1995).

             In addition to public databases queried during the desktop review, the installa-
             tion's Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (Atlantic Division, Naval
             Facilities Engineering Command 2000) was reviewed for descriptions of previ-
             ously noted water resources.

             2.6 Field Surveys
             Field surveys were conducted on April 1 through April 6, April 30 through May
             3, and May 12, 2013, to delineate and characterize water resources occurring
             within approximately 860 acres of the former NAS JRB Willow Grove property.
             The delineation did not include areas of the former installation that have been, or
             will be, transferred to other federal agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Admin-
             istration and the U.S. Air Force (Horsham Air Guard Station).

             Field data collected during the wetland delineation were recorded on "Wetland
             Determination Data Form: Eastern Mountains and Piedmont Region" datasheets
             (see Appendix A). A "Wetland Jurisdictional Field Data Sheet" was also com-
             pleted for each delineated wetland (see Appendix A). In general, after prelimi-
             nary identification of potential wetland areas based on vegetation and hydrology,
             the following activities were performed at each location to assist in verifying the
             presence of a wetland and delineating the wetland boundaries:

              The Wetland Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory 1987) and the
              Regional Supplement (USACE 2012) provide guidelines for determining the
              presence of wetland hydrology. In general, the criteria for wetland hydrology
              are met if the area is inundated or saturated at the soil surface during the
              growing season for a time sufficient to develop hydric soils and support hy-

                                                2-6                                     June 2013

                 drophytic vegetation. In some instances, it is necessary to use other field
                 characteristics to identify wetland hydrology. These characteristics may in-
                 clude water staining, sediment deposits, drainage patterns, or drift lines. Hy-
                 drologic characteristics, as well as the depth of surface water or depth to soil
                 saturation, were recorded for each wetland area.
              To determine the presence of hydrophytic vegetation, the dominant species in
              each major vegetative stratum (i.e., tree, shrub/sapling, herbaceous, and
              woody vine) and their relative percent cover were identified and recorded.
              Each dominant plant species was then associated with its wetland indicator
              status (i.e., OBL, FACW, FAC, FACU, or UPL) as defined by Lichvar (2012).
              If the percent cover is dominated by species that are classified as FAC,
              FACW, or OBL then hydrophytic vegetation is deemed to be present.
              Soils were examined by using a tile spade shovel, or "sharpshooter," to a
              depth of at least 36 centimeters (cm) (14 inches), if possible. Wherever dis-
              turbance of the soils caused by past excavation or fill activity was evident, a
              soil characterization was performed in adjacent, undisturbed areas within the
              potential wetland, if present. Soils were characterized at a depth immediately
              below the A-horizon or at 30 cm (12 inches), whichever was shallower. Soil
              colors were identified using a Munsell Soil Color Chart (Munsell Color 2009),
              and characteristics such as the presence of mottles and soil texture were rec-
              orded. Hydric characteristics such as organic soil layers, gleying, mottling,
              and oxidized rhizospheres were noted where they occurred.
              Each wetland was classified according to the USFWS hierarchical classifica-
              tion system developed by Cowardin et al. (1979).

             In addition to delineating wetland boundaries, information on seeps, streams, and
             ponds/lakes was also collected. Man-made and natural features such as ditches,
             swales, drainage patterns, and culverts were also mapped as necessary to describe
             the hydrologic regime related to the wetlands at NAS JRB Willow Grove. Only
             man-made features connected to a wetland or stream with a significant enough
             function worth noting were mapped.

             Based on the methods described above, the boundary of each water resource was
             determined and flagged with wetland delineation tape. Flag locations were sur-
             veyed using a Trimble GeoXT global positioning system (GPS) unit. Electronic
             files were then generated from the GPS survey for integration into figures for
             NAS JRB Willow Grove. Photographs were taken at each delineated feature (see
             Appendix B).

3   Results

    3.1 Wetlands
    Twenty-three wetland features encompassing a total of 25.96 acres were identi-
    fied during the survey (see Figures 3-1, Frames 1 through 6). The 23 wetlands
    listed in Table 3-1 are identified on Figure 3-1 by 32 polygons; some features
    with a distinct upland area between them were treated as a single wetland if they
    had similar conditions and shared a distinct hydrologic connection. It is likely
    that many of these features were once larger wetlands that have been bisected by
    human activities. A summary of each wetland is provided in Table 3-1.

               corner of the property (see Figure 3-1, Frame 1). The wetland continues off
               the property to the north and receives hydrologic inputs from a retention
               pond located off the NAS JRB Willow Grove property. The wetland appears
               to have a discrete ephemeral connection to W02 and Park Creek (S02) via a
               swale (D01) that runs southeast, off the installation property. Dominant her-
               baceous species in the wetland include common fox sedge (Carex vulpinoi-
               dea), lesser poverty rush (Juncus tenuis), lamp rush (Juncus effusus), and
               common velvet grass (Holcus lanatus).
               Wetland W02: This 1.62 acres PFO1 wetland was delineated as two sepa-
               rate sections north of Keith Valley Road (see Figure 3-1, Frame 1). The
               western section encompasses 0.49 acres, and the eastern section encompasses
               1.13 acres. The eastern section of the wetland continues to the east, off NAS
               JRB Willow Grove property. The wetland is located within the floodplain
               terrace of Park Creek (S02) and is bisected by a stream (S01) that flows south
               to Park Creek (S02). Each wetland section has a discrete ephemeral connec-
               tion to S01. A swale (D02) is also present at the eastern end of the wetland
               that connects directly to Park Creek (S02). At the time of the survey, approx-
               imately 25 percent of the wetland was inundated or saturated at the surface.
               Dominant trees include silver maple (Acer saccharinum), American elm
               (Ulmus americana), and red maple (Acer rubrum). American elm, northern
               spicebush (Lindera benzoin), and rambler rose (Rosa multiflora) occur in the
               sapling/shrub stratum, and melic manna grass (Glyceria melicaria), thyme-
               leaf speedwell (Veronica serpyllifolia), fig buttercup (Ficaria verna), and
               lamp rush occur in the herbaceous stratum.

               Wetland W03: This 0.30 acres wetland borders the north side of Keith Val-
               ley Road; it continues off of the installation property to the east (see Figure
               3-1, Frame 1). The wetland connects to Park Creek (S02) through a drainage
               (D03) originating on the south side of Keith Valley Road. It is a PEM1 wet-
               land close to the road, and transitions to a PSS1 wetland and PFO1 wetland
               moving north from the road. Green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) is the
               dominant tree species and also occurs in the sapling stratum. Red osier
               (Cornus alba) also occurs in the sapling stratum. Herbaceous species include
               skunk-cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus), lamp rush, fig buttercup, uptight
               sedge (Carex stricta), and sensitive fern (Onoclea sensibilis).
               Wetland W04: This 0.83 acres PSS1/PFO1 wetland is located along the pe-
               rimeter fence on the south side of Keith Valley Road (see Figure 3-1, Frame
               1). The wetland is bisected by a road and was delineated as two separate
               polygons; the western portion encompasses 0.41 acres and the eastern portion
               encompasses 0.42 acres. The two areas are connected by a culvert and drain
               into a narrow roadside ditch along Keith Valley Road (D06). A small
               hillside seep (H01) was also noted during the survey draining into D06. Cul-
               verts (D04 and D05) continue under Keith Valley Road and drain into Park
               Creek (S02). At the time of the survey, approximately 20 percent of the wet-
               land was inundated. The wetland contains an abundance of trees up to 40
               feet tall and saplings up to 20 feet tall. Silver maple, slippery elm (Ulmus
               rubra), and red maple dominate the tree stratum. Silver maple and slippery
               elm are also common in the sapling stratum, along with red osier and black
               willow (Salix nigra). The herbaceous stratum is dominated by common reed
               (Phragmites australis), sensitive fern, and field horsetail (Equisetum arven-
               se).
               Wetland W05: This 0.24 acres PFO1 depression may be man-made, as it is
               bounded by berms and appears to have been used for debris disposal (see
               Figure 3-1, Frame 1). Soils are hydric and show evidence of disturbance. A
               majority of the wetland was inundated with several inches of water at the
               time of the survey. The tree stratum is dominated by silver maple, green ash,
               and eastern red-cedar (Juniperus virginiana). Northern spicebush (Lindera
               benzoin), southern arrow-wood (Viburnum dentatum), and silver maple are
               common in the sapling/shrub stratum.
               Wetland W06: This 2.94 acres PSS1/PFO1 wetland is situated in a depres-
               sion created by bermed roads on all sides (see Figure 3-1, Frame 1). The
               roads separate this wetland from W07, W08, and W09. A culvert/drain
               (D07) joins W08 to W06. Water appears to flow north from W08 into W06;
               however, no outlet from W06 was identified. Much of W06 was inundated at
               the time of the survey. Forested areas of the wetland are dominated by red
               maple, green ash, northern red oak (Quercus rubra), and slippery elm in the
               tree stratum. Southern arrow-wood, red osier, red maple, slippery elm, and
               flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) are common in the sapling/shrub stra-
               tum. In the scrub-shrub portions of the wetland, crack willow (Salix fragilis)
               and red maple are common saplings/shrubs; fringed yellow-loosestrife (Ly-
               simachia ciliata) and rufous bulrush (Scirpus pendulus) are common herbs.

               Wetland 07: This 0.66 acres PSS1/PFO1 wetland is situated in a depression
               created by bermed roads to the south and east (see Figure 3-1, Frame 1),
               which separate this wetland from W06, W08, and W09. This wetland was
               not inundated at the time of the survey; however, the soil was saturated to the
               surface and primary (i.e., oxidized rhizospheres) and secondary (e.g., drain-
               age patterns) wetland hydrology indicators were observed. Forested portions
               of this wetland are dominated by red maple and eastern red-cedar in the tree
               stratum, and red maple, southern arrow-wood, and rambler rose in the sap-
               ling/shrub stratum. In the scrub-shrub portions of the wetland, red osier,
               green ash, crack willow, and red maple are common in the sapling/shrub stra-
               tum, and lamp rush, uptight sedge, thyme-leaf speedwell, Canadian golden-
               rod (Solidago canadensis), fowl manna grass (Glyceria striata), and arrow-
               leaf tearthumb (Persicaria sagittata) are common in the herb stratum.
               Wetland W08: This 7.04 acres wetland has PFO1, PSS1, and PEM1 com-
               ponents (see Figure 3-1, Frames 1 and 2). As with other wetlands in this area
               (i.e., W06, W07, and W09), it is a depression bounded by bermed roads. A
               0.18 acres portion of the wetland was delineated to the west of the main wet-
               land area. This portion is a PEM1 wetland connected to the main wetland by
               a culvert (D10) (see Figure 3-1, Frame 2). D08 and D09 appear to be hydro-
               logic inputs into W08. W08 drains into W06 through a culvert (D07); how-
               ever, these wetlands appear to be isolated, as no outlet from W06 was ob-
               served. This wetland appears to have been cleared in the past, possibly for
               clear zone maintenance. Forested areas are dominated by red maple, silver
               maple, and green ash in the tree stratum; red osier, flowering dogwood,
               American plum (Prunus americana), red maple, green ash, southern arrow-
               wood, rambler rose, and twinsisters (Lonicera tatarica) in the sapling/shrub
               stratum; and, soft fox sedge (Carex conjuncta), Japanese honeysuckle (Lo-
               nicera japonica), and rufous bulrush in the herb stratum. Scrub-shrub areas
               contain saplings of red osier, black willow, green ash, ash-leaf maple (Acer
               negundo), pin oak, and red maple. Common reed and rufous bulrush occur in
               the herb stratum. PEM areas of the wetland are almost entirely vegetated
               with common reed.
               Wetland W09: This 0.71 acres PEM1/PSS1 wetland is situated in a depres-
               sion created by bermed roads to the north and east (see Figure 3-1, Frame 1),
               which separate this wetland from W06, W07, and W08. The wetland appears
               isolated, as no outlets were observed during the survey. As with W08, W09
               appears to have been cleared in the past, and contains emergent vegetation in
               the center with a scrub-shrub fringe. The center portion of the wetland was
               inundated at the time of the survey. The emergent portion of the wetland is
               dominated by rufous bulrush, uptight sedge, broad-leaf cat-tail (Typha latifo-
               lia), harvestlice (Agrimonia parviflora), blunt spike-rush (Eleocharis obtusa),
               and arrow-leaf tearthumb. Scattered saplings of green ash, slippery elm, and
               pin oak (Quercus palustris) are also present. The scrub-shrub fringe is dom-
               inated by pin oak, red osier, red maple, and slippery elm.
               Wetland W10: This is 0.06 acres isolated PFO1 depressional wetland is ad-
               jacent to a road (see Figure 3-1, Frame 2). At the time of the survey, it was
               inundated with 2 to 3 inches of water. It is dominated by red maple and sil-

                                             3-16                                 June 2013

                  ver maple, with red maple saplings also present. No herb stratum is present
                  in the wetland.
               Wetland W11: This 0.69 acres PFO1/PEM1 wetland occurs within a
               stormwater outfall on the eastern side of NAS JRB Willow Grove (see Figure
               3-1, Frame 3). It was delineated as two separate areas connected through a
               culvert (D11) under A Avenue. The western portion encompasses 0.58 acres
               and the eastern portion encompasses 0.11 acres. It drains northeast, off the
               installation. The PEM portion of the wetland is dominated by broad-leaf cat-
               tail, and the PFO portion is dominated by weeping willow (Salix babylonica).
               Wetland W12: This 0.07 acres isolated PEM1 wetland occurs within a re-
               tention pond (see Figure 3-1, Frame 3). It is dominated by broad-leaf cattail,
               but also contains lamp rush and needle spike-rush (Eleocharis acicularis).
               Wetland W13: This 0.76 acres wetland is primarily a PSS1 wetland with
               areas of open water, but it contains some pockets of larger trees within its in-
               terior and along its fringe (see Figure 3-1, Frame 4). An old boardwalk and
               evidence of altered hydrology were observed during the survey. A previous-
               ly mapped NHD stream was not located, likely as a result of the previous dis-
               turbance. However, a culvert (D12) was identified at the western end of the
               wetland that drains the wetland area under a road and off the installation.
               Larger trees include red maple, shag-bark hickory (Carya ovata), and crack
               willow. The scrub-shrub areas are dominated by red osier, red maple, and
               pin oak.
               Wetland W14: This 3.68 acres wetland contains PSS1/PEM1 and PFO1
               wetlands and open water. It was delineated as two separate areas (see Figure
               3-1, Frame 4). The eastern area encompasses 3.28 acres and consists of a
               mixed PSS1/PEM1 wetland to the east that flows into an open water pond to
               the west. The pond is dammed by a road on its western side. A culvert and
               spill gate (D13 and D14) drain water to the west into a 0.40 acres PFO1 wet-
               land. The system drains southwest off the installation through a culvert
               (D15). An overflowing monitoring well (D16) was noted during the survey;
               water from this well was flowing north into the wetland. Beaver (Castor
               canadensis) activity was noted throughout this wetland system. The
               PSS/PEM portion of the wetland is dominated by red osier, crack willow,
               sensitive fern, and uptight sedge. The forested portions are dominated by red
               maple, green ash, and tuliptree (Liriodendron tulipifera) in the tree stratum.
               Wetland W15: This 1.06 acres isolated PEM1 wetland is located in a de-
               pression between the runway and taxiway (see Figure 3-1, Frame 5). The
               size of the wetland is likely limited by a stormwater drain (D17), which
               drains the area during high water periods. At the time of the survey, soils
               within the wetland were saturated to the surface and inundated areas occurred
               in the interior. A seep (H02) was noted as a hydrologic input to the wetland.
               Dominant species include dark-green bulrush (Scirpus atrovirens), lamp
               rush, sallow sedge (Carex lurida), and slender spike-rush (Eleocharis tenuis).
               Wetland W16: This 0.09 acres isolated PSS1 wetland abuts a paved road
               and the airfield perimeter fence (see Figure 3-1, Frame 5). Portions of the
               wetland are disturbed with rock and debris. Dominant species include red

                                             3-17                                  June 2013

                  osier and crack willow in the shrub stratum, and rufous bulrush, lamp rush,
                  and Canadian goldenrod in the herb stratum.
               Wetland W17: This 0.30 acres isolated PSS1 wetland was delineated as two
               separate areas, as it is divided by a road (see Figure 3-1, Frame 5). The
               western portion encompasses 0.10 acres, and the eastern portion encom-
               passes 0.20 acres. Both portions were inundated at the time of the survey.
               The sapling/shrub layer is dominated by pussy willow (Salix discolor), crack
               willow, and red osier; the herb layer is dominated by common reed.
               Wetland W18: This 0.44 acres mixed PSS1/PFO1/PEM1 wetland is located
               in the wooded margins of the airfield (see Figure 3-1, Frame 5). It was de-
               lineated as two areas connected by an upland swale (D18). The northern por-
               tion encompasses 0.28 acres, and the southern portion encompasses 0.16
               acres. While the two portions are connected to each other, the wetland ap-
               pears to be isolated. Forested areas contain crack willow and red maple in
               the tree stratum and red osier, crack willow, and red maple in the sap-
               ling/shrub stratum. PSS and PEM areas contain saplings of crack willow and
               red osier, with lamp rush, uptight sedge, and field horsetail in the herb layer.
               Wetland W19: This 0.5 acres PFO1 wetland is drained by a stream (S04)
               (see Figure 3-1, Frames 5 and 6). It was delineated as two areas connected
               by a culvert (D19), which conveys a stream (S04) under a paved path; an ad-
               ditional culvert (D20) also feeds into this stream. During the survey, an
               overflowing well or manhole cover (H03) was noted providing additional
               hydrologic input to S04. S04 drains from the installation via a culvert (D22).
               The eastern portion of the wetland encompasses 0.34 acres, and the western
               portion of the wetland encompasses 0.16 acres. Dominant trees include red
               maple and green ash; red osier and red maple are common saplings.
               Wetland W20: This 0.36 acres PSS1 wetland is adjacent to a stream (S03)
               (see Figure 3-1, Frames 5 and 6). The wetland is separated from the stream
               by approximately 5 feet at the closest point, but likely has a subsurface con-
               nection. S03 drains into S04, which drains from the installation via a culvert
               (D22). The sapling/shrub stratum is primarily composed of red osier, but al-
               so contains red maple; rufous bulrush is dominant in the herb stratum.
               Wetland W21: This 0.04 acres PEM1 wetland is associated with a drainage
               ditch (see Figure 3-1, Frame 6). It is connected to other waterbodies on NAS
               JRB Willow Grove via a storm sewer. Broad-leaf cat-tail is the dominant
               vegetation; lesser poverty rush, needle spike-rush, and broom-sedge (Andro-
               pogon virginicus) also occur.
               Wetland W22: This 3.30 acres PSS1/PFO1 wetland complex contains two
               open-water ponds (see Figure 3-1, Frame 6). The wetland complex drains
               via S05, which drains from the installation via a culvert (D22). A man-made
               ditch (D21) flows southwest into S05. In addition, two seeps (H04 and H05)
               provide hydrologic inputs into S05. The PSS portions of the wetland are
               dominated by red maple and red osier in the sapling/shrub stratum, and sensi-
               tive fern and broad-leaf cat-tail in the herb stratum. PFO portions of the wet-
               land are dominated by red maple in the tree stratum. The sapling/shrub stra-
               tum consists of red maple saplings and red osier, Virginia rose (Rosa virgini-

                                              3-18                                 June 2013

                  ana), and Allegheny blackberry (Rubus allegheniensis). The two open-water
                  ponds are connected by D23.
              Wetland W23: This 0.21 acres PEM1 wetland is situated within a wide
              swale with berms on either side (see Figure 3-1, Frame 6). It appears to have
              been man-made for stormwater runoff. The wetland is delineated as two are-
              as; the northern area encompasses 0.15 acres, and the southern area encom-
              passes 0.06 acres. The two areas are hydrologically linked by a drainage ditch
              (D25). Two culverts (D24 and D27) appear to be hydrologic inputs to the sys-
              tem, while a third culvert (D26) appears to be an outlet from the system. The
              northern portion of the wetland appears to be permanently inundated, while
              the southern portion appears to be intermittently inundated. Dominant plants
              in both portions include common fox sedge and lamp rush.

             3.2 Waterbodies
             In addition to the wetlands described in Section 3.1, information on other hydro-
             logic features at NAS JRB Willow Grove was collected. Three ponds were noted
             during the survey. All three of the ponds occur within the extent of wetlands
             (W14 and W22); therefore, specific pond boundaries were not delineated. Other
             features noted during the survey included drains, other hydrologic (hydrology)
             features, and streams. In general, drains refer to man-made structures such as
             ditches and culverts. Hydrology features generally include naturally occurring
             seeps. Streams are generally naturally occurring and can be intermittent or peren-
             nial. The features mapped at NAS JRB Willow Grove, including their associated
             wetland(s) or other feature(s), are summarized in Table 3-2. Descriptions of the
             features are included with their associated wetland in Section 3.1.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

 This plot is located in a swale associated with D03 culvert and drainage line north of Keith Valley Road and at the eastern edge of the survey corridor.
 The swale and wetland extends only a short distance but is situated in PEM areas abutting Keith Valley Road, PSS areas, as well as PFO areas where
 the wetland ends near the right bank of Park Creek.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Confined: +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

 The prevalence test is a better representation of this wetland community than the dominance test. Not included in this plot is Pinus virginiana (UPL).
 Several pinus v. and Juniperus v. are located within the wetland boundary. These are stressed and dying but do push the overall vegetation
 community closer to upland than what is reflected in the dominance test at this plot.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Confined: +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Confined: +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Confined: +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

Definitions
Abutting: Wetlands that provide a continuous surface connection to relatively permanent waters that flow directly or indirectly into
         TNWs are abutting. The wetland boundary must interface with the OHWM of the tributary. If the wetland boundary does not
         abut the OHWM of the tributary, the wetland is adjacent. Abutting wetlands are not separated from tributaries by uplands,
         berms, dikes, or similar features. It is important to note, a continuous surface connection does not require surface water to be
         continuously present between the wetland and tributary.

Adjacent: bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. Adjacent wetlands may have a continuous surface connection to TNWs, but may
       also be separated from these waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or similar features. By
       definition, a continuous surface water connection is not required to establish adjacency.

Hydrologically Isolated: no surface water connections to other aquatic features exist.

Perennial: has flowing water year-round during a typical year.

Intermittent: has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow.

Ephemeral: has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year.

Discrete: 348 +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317! 720./8 +,56,77043 ;/,6, ;(8,6 6937"

Confined: +,-03,+ ),+ (3+ )(317"

Overland Sheet Flow: no defined channel, comprised of runoff.

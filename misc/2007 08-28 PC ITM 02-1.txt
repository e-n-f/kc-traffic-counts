EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed Golden Hill Retail
Center (GHRC) located in Paso Robles, California. The site is located on the west side of Golden Hill Road
between SR 46 East and Dallons Road. The proposed 290,732-square foot shopping center includes a home
improvement superstore, various retail stores, a drugstore, and restaurants. Although the current site plan has
slightly changed with two retail pads replacing the drugstore, this traffic study analyzes the original project
description that contains more square footage and generates a higher number of trips.

The purpose of the analysis is to identify potential transportation impacts of the proposed project on the
surrounding roadway system, and recommend appropriate improvements to mitigate impacts considered
significant in comparison to set thresholds. The roadway system was evaluated under Existing, Existing Plus
Project, Near-Term, and Year 2030 Conditions for typical weekday AM and PM peak hours plus the Friday PM
peak hour. The impacts of the project were also evaluated for alternate modes of travel including bicycle,
pedestrian, and transit.

PROJECT TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
The proposed retail development is estimated to generate approximately 12,400 net new daily trips, 720 net new
AM peak-hour trips, and 1,020 net new PM peak-hour trips. The project site is assumed to generate the same
number of trips during the Friday PM peak-hour as the typical weekday PM peak-hour.

KEY TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS

Analysis Periods

The traffic study includes an evaluation of the Friday peak-hour conditions in addition to typical weekday
(Tuesday to Thursday) commute conditions. In general, traffic operations on SR 46 are more congested during
Friday PM peak-hour because of weekend traffic traveling to and from the Central Valley. The inclusion of Friday
PM peak-hour traffic operations was requested by Caltrans. The analysis for the City's General Plan Circulation
Element analyzed typical weekday conditions and not recreational weekend peak travel (Friday PM peak-hour).

Level of Service Standards

The City of Paso Robles maintains level of service (LOS) D as the minimum acceptable level of service for
intersections (i.e., LOS E and F are considered unacceptable operations). Caltrans has more stringent standards
than the City of Paso Robles and strives to maintain operations at the LOS C/D threshold on state-operated
facilities in the study area, which include US 101 and SR 46. Therefore, LOS C or better is considered acceptable
on Caltrans facilities.

Regional Growth

For the Near-term Cumulative (Year 2010) and Cumulative (Year 2030) scenarios, Caltrans requested that an
annual growth rate of 4.1 percent per year (based on 13 years of historical counts) be applied to the existing
volumes in the SR 46 corridor to account for growth. While this growth rate is not typically sustained over a 20- to
30-year period, its use results in a conservative estimate of traffic, where the existing volumes are projected to
increase by 20 percent for Near-term Cumulative and 100 percent for Cumulative conditions, Growth includes
some traffic from other development in Paso Robles, and substantial regional traffic that has origins and
destinations outside the City.

                                                                                                                  1

Under the Cumulative (Year 2030) volumes, project traffic generally represents five (5) percent or less of the total
volumes at intersections on SR 46 west and east of Golden Hill Road. In addition, the Cumulative scenario
analyzed for this study reflects a five-year horizon beyond what was evaluated in the City's Circulation Element
(Year 2025).

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

Intersections

Significant impacts are anticipated at all study intersections under near-term or long-term conditions with the
proposed project in place. For Existing Plus Project Conditions, the following will mitigate significant impacts:

                 ·   planned improvements (second westbound left-turn at the US 101/SR 46 interchange,
                     widening of SR 46, east of Airport Road, to four lanes, and roundabout at Golden Hill
                     Road/Union Road ),

                 ·   widening of SR 46/Golden Hill Road intersection, and

                 ·   prohibition of northbound left-turns at SR 46/Union Road.

These improvements will substantially improve the level of service ratings at SR 46/Golden Hill Road (LOS F to
LOS D) and Golden Hill Road/Union Road (LOS E/F to LOS A).

Under Near-Term Conditions, representing traffic growth to Year 2010 which accounts for buildout of the project,
construction of one pending and all approved projects near the site, and future growth in the SR 46 corridor,
capacity improvements were identified at all locations including a grade-separation at SR 46/Airport Road. An
assessment district fee will be collected to secure funding for the SR 46/Airport Road interchange. The project
applicant required participation in this program will constitute its fair share towards the SR 46/Airport Road
improvements.

Under Cumulative (Year 2030) Conditions, the removal of at-grade crossings on SR 46 (via an upgrade to an
expressway or freeway) would provide improved corridor operations. Closure of Buena Vista Drive, Union Road,
and Mill Road would likely be required to meet Caltrans requirements for spacing of grade-separated
interchanges. Grade-separation of intersections is anticipated at Golden Hill Road, Airport Road, and Jardine
Road. However, substantial right-of-way acquisition is required. To mitigate near-term and cumulative impacts,
the project applicant has agreed to provide a 30-foot easement to the City of Paso Robles along the southern
project frontage to provide sufficient right-of-way to accommodate future improvements to SR 46. According to
Caltrans District 5 staff, the easement would allow for a future upgrade of SR 46 to provide additional capacity.
Caltrans staff has indicated that this easement in addition to the proposed Existing Plus Project improvements
would constitute "fair-share" contribution towards near-term and cumulative impacts on SR 46. As noted in the
previous section, the project traffic represents a small percentage of the total intersections volumes on SR 46
under Cumulative Conditions.

We strongly recommend that a comprehensive SR 46 corridor study be conducted to evaluate the potential for
modification or removal of at-grade crossings and to address all design issues, including right-of-way concerns
and appropriate locations for on- and off-ramps.




                                                                                                                  2

Roadway Segments

A planning level analysis was conducted to determine if the study roadway segments are operating below or over
capacity. Because this type of analysis is general in nature and does not take into account delays and other
factors affecting capacity, impacts usually defer to a more detailed operational analysis (intersection and freeway
ramp levels of service).

Based on the results of the planning analysis, widening of SR 46 (to four lanes), east of Airport, and Golden Hill
Road, north of SR 46, will provide acceptable operations under Existing Plus Project Conditions. The analysis
indicates a grade-separated facility on SR 46 will be required under Cumulative (Year 2030) Conditions to provide
sufficient capacity.

The City of Paso Robles is contemplating an extension of Dallons Road east from Golden Hill Road to Airport
Road to provide an alternate parallel facility to US 101. This roadway extension would provide an alternate route
to SR 46 between Buena Vista Drive and Airport Road, improve local circulation and reduce the need for local
traffic to use SR 46. The extension of Dallons Drive would serve as an interim facility until additional capacity on
SR 46 is provided.

Pedestrian, Bicycle, and Transit Facilities

Pedestrian sidewalks are proposed along the perimeter of the site and pedestrian crosswalks provide connections
between the parking aisles and the buildings. Plans to widen Dallons Road and Golden Hill Road shall not
preclude construction of future bicycle facilities. Bike lanes are to be provided along the east side of Golden Hill
Road north of SR 46, and along the west side of Golden Hill Road between Dallons Road and the project
driveway. As directed by the City of Paso Robles staff, the 10-foot wide sidewalk on the west side of Golden Hill
Road between the project driveway and SR 46 is to be maintained, and the bike lane will transition to a signed
bike route (Class III facility).

The project sponsor shall coordinate with San Luis Obispo Regional Transit Authority (RTA) and the City of Paso
Robles to provide transit service to the site (i.e. modify North County Shuttle route). With the above
recommendations, the project's impacts are mitigated to a less-than-significant level.

SITE ACCESS AND ON-SITE CIRCULATION
The number of proposed driveways is sufficient to accommodate the total number of trips generated by the
project land uses. Roadway improvement plans were prepared to determine the ultimate width and the required
traffic control measures on Golden Hill Road and Dallons Road adjacent to the project site. The Golden Hill Road
plans call for a traffic signal at the project driveway with a raised median located from the signal to SR 46. The
Dallons Road plans call for one lane of travel in each direction with an eastbound bike lane and a center two-way
left-turn lane. The project applicant will be responsible for implementation and construction of these
improvements.

The original site plan was modified to include the following improvements recommended by Fehr & Peers (site
plan dated March 8, 2007):

    1. Parking was eliminated in front of Majors 3 and 4 so that vehicles entering or exiting will not conflict with
       traffic on the main aisle.

    2. An all-way stop at the internal intersection located southeast of the Garden Center was provided.



                                                                                                                  3

1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed Golden Hill Retail
Center (GHRC) located on the west side of Golden Hill Road between SR 46 East and Dallons Road in Paso
Robles, California. The proposed project includes a 290,732 square foot shopping center with a home
improvement superstore, general shopping center, drugstore, and restaurants. Although the current site plan has
slightly changed with two retail pads replacing the drugstore, this traffic study analyzes the original project
description that contains more square footage and generates a higher number of trips.

The analysis was conducted to identify potential transportation impacts of the proposed development on the
surrounding roadway system and to recommend appropriate improvements to mitigate significant impacts. Figure
1 presents a map of the project location. Figure 2 shows the proposed GHRC site plan.

Existing and future conditions were evaluated with level of service (LOS) calculations for the key intersections and
roadway segments near the project site. Significant impacts were determined following guidelines from the City of
Paso Robles and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).

The analysis evaluated the operations of the following key intersections, roadway segments, and freeway ramp
junctions:

The operations of the study intersections, roadway and freeway segments, and freeway ramp junctions were
evaluated during the summertime morning (AM), summertime evening (PM), and summertime Friday evening
(Friday PM) peak periods for the following four scenarios:

        Scenario 1:       Existing Conditions ­ Existing volumes obtained from counts or previous recent traffic
                          studies.

        Scenario 2:       Existing Plus Project Conditions ­ Existing volumes plus new traffic generated by the
                          proposed retail center.

        Scenario 3:       Near-Term Cumulative Plus Project Conditions ­ Scenario 2 volumes plus 4.1% annual
                          interregional growth on SR 46 to Year 2010 plus traffic generated by approved and
                          pending developments.

        Scenario 4:       Year 2030 Cumulative Conditions ­ Scenario 3 volumes with 4.1% annual interregional
                          growth on SR 46 through volume plus 1% annual growth on side-streets to Year 2030,
                          plus traffic generated by the Chandler Ranch Area Specific Plan and Cuesta College
                          expansion.

This remainder of this report is divided into four chapters. The existing transportation system serving the site and
the current operating conditions of the study intersections and roadway segments are described in Chapter 2.
Chapter 3 describes the method used to estimate the traffic added to the surrounding roadways by the proposed
project and its impacts on the transportation system. This chapter also includes a discussion of site access and
on-site circulation. Chapter 4 presents the results of Near-term Cumulative Conditions, and Year 2030 Cumulative
Conditions are described in Chapter 5.

2.     EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the existing conditions of the roadway facilities, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, transit
service, traffic volumes, and intersection operations. This chapter also includes a discussion of the methodology
used to calculate levels of service (LOS) and the corresponding results.

EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK
The project location and the surrounding roadway network are presented on Figure 1. Regional access is
provided by US 101 and State Route 46 (SR 46). Golden Hill Road, Union Road, Airport Road, Buena Vista Drive,
River Road, and Dallons Road provide local access. Descriptions of these roadways are provided below.

US Highway 101 is a regional facility that traverses through San Luis Obispo County, continuing north to San
Francisco and south to Los Angeles. Within the study area, US 101 is a four-lane freeway with an interchange at
SR 46E.

State Route 46 is an east-west, four-lane highway
between US 101 and Airport Road. East of Airport
Road, SR 46 contains two travel lanes. SR 46
provides an east-west regional connection to I-5 in the
Central Valley and to Bakersfield and Fresno (via SR
41). Between Jardine Road and US 101, two
signalized intersections are located at Buena Vista
Drive and Golden Hill Road. During the peak summer
months, this corridor is highly congested in the
westbound direction on Friday evenings and
eastbound on Sunday afternoons.
                                                                  View of westbound SR 46 approaching Golden Hill Road

are not provided along SR 46E. At the intersection of SR 46E-24th Street/US 101 Southbound Ramps, sidewalks
are currently under construction to allow travel across the highway. Pedestrians signals are provided at the SR
46/Golden Hill Road intersection to allow pedestrians to cross SR 46. Sidewalks are not provided on SR 46,
Jardine Road, Dry Creek Road, or Beacon Road.

Bicycle facilities include bike paths, bike lanes, and bike routes. Bike paths (Class I facilities) are paved pathways
for use by bicycles that are separated from roadways. Bike lanes (Class II facilities) are lanes on roadways
designated for use by bicycles with special lane markings, pavement legends, and signage. Bike routes (Class III
facilities) are designated with signs only. Bike facilities are not provided on any of the surrounding roadways or
streets around the project site.

TRANSIT SERVICE
The North County Shuttle (NCS) provides bus service to Paso Robles, Templeton, and Atascadero. Paso Robles
City Area Transit System (PRCATS) provides bus service within the City of Paso Robles. The San Luis Obispo
Regional Transit Authority (RTA) operates intercity bus service in San Luis Obispo County. There is no direct
transit service provided to the project site. Transit service in the City of Paso Robles is described below.

North County Shuttle provides bus service between Paso Robles, Templeton, and Atascadero. The NCS provides
hourly service Monday through Friday 7:00 AM to 7:15 PM. Saturday service operates hourly from 10:35 AM to
4:35 PM. The NCS does not operate Sunday service. A bus stop is located at the northeast corner of the Buena
Vista Drive/Dallons Road intersection.

RTA Route 9 provides intercity fixed-route service between San Luis Obispo, Santa Margarita, Atascadero,
Templeton, and Paso Robles, with limited service to San Miguel. Service to Paso Robles operates Monday
through Friday from 5:50 AM to 9:40 PM with sixteen trips in each direction. Service operates on Saturdays and
Sundays from 7:31 AM to 6:31 PM with three trips in each direction.

PRCATS provides fixed-route bus service along two designated routes within the City of Paso Robles. Service
operates from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday through Saturday. PRCATS does not provide Sunday service. In
addition, PRCATS operates a Dial-A-Ride service within the city limits Monday through Friday only from 7:00 AM
to 8:00 PM.

Runabout provides countywide ADA paratransit service for qualified individuals within ¾ mile of the fixed-route
bus service. Runabout service hours are the same as the fixed-route services.

Amtrak provides intercity rail and bus service at the station located at 8th Street and Pine Street in Paso Robles,
approximately 8 miles southwest of the project site. The Coast Starlight line makes two stops daily on weekdays,
one southbound at 1:38 PM and one northbound at 4:45 PM. The Pacific Surfliner bus service provides four
additional trips daily to San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and south, and five additional trips daily to San Jose and
San Francisco. The San Joaquin bus service provides one trip daily from the Paso Robles station north to
Hanford and south to Santa Maria. The Capitol Corridor bus service provides one trip daily from the station north
to San Jose and Oakland and south to Santa Barbara.

EXISTING VOLUMES AND LANE CONFIGURATIONS
Year 2005 summertime weekday morning (AM), weekday evening (PM), and Friday evening (Friday PM) peak-
hour traffic volumes at the SR 46 study intersections were obtained from the Final SR 46E/Airport Road PSR. The
volumes on SR 46 represent unconstrained volumes on SR 46 provided that sufficient capacity is available at
Highway 101/SR 46 interchange and traffic does not divert from SR 46 to the side streets.

The peak hour represents the highest one-hour volumes during the weekday commute peak periods (7:00-9:00
AM and 4:00-6:00 PM). Summertime Friday evening peak-hour traffic volumes are typically higher than weekday
evening peak-hour volumes due to regional traffic from I-5 east of Paso Robles.

The inclusion of Friday PM peak-hour traffic operations was requested by Caltrans. The analysis for the City's
General Plan Circulation Element analyzed typical weekday conditions and not recreational weekend peak travel
(Friday PM peak-hour).

New intersection counts were conducted or provided by Caltrans staff at the following locations to supplement the
2005 counts:

    ·   Buena Vista Drive/Dallons Road (September 2006);

    ·   Golden Hill Road/Dallons Road (September 2006);

    ·   SR 46/Airport Road (January 2007); and

    ·   SR 46/Golden Hill Road (March 2007).

The Year 2005 volumes turning to/from SR 46 to Golden Hill and Airport Road were adjusted to reflect the more
recent traffic counts that were higher. Similarly, adjustments were made at the Buena Vista Drive/Dallons Road
and Golden Hill Road/Dallons Road intersections. Although the 2007 volumes show a decrease in through
volumes on SR 46 at Golden Hill Road, those lower volumes were not used in the analysis.

Figure 3 presents the existing AM, PM, and Friday PM peak-hour turning movement volumes at the study
intersections. Figure 4 presents the existing lane configurations and traffic control devices at each intersection.

Year 2005 freeway mainline counts for US 101 and SR 46 were provided by Caltrans. New 72-hour (3-day)
machine counts were conducted for local roadways in April 2006. Figure 5 presents the average daily traffic
volumes for the study roadway segments. The new intersection and roadway counts are located in Appendix A.

LEVEL OF SERVICE METHODOLOGY
The quality of roadway facility operations are described with the term level of service (LOS). LOS is a qualitative
description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six levels
are defined, from LOS A with the best operating conditions to LOS F with the worst operating conditions. LOS E
represents "at-capacity" operations. Two methodologies were used to evaluate the study intersections: one
method for the signalized intersections and another method for the unsignalized intersections.




                                                                                                                11

Intersection Level of Service Criteria

The City of Paso Robles maintains LOS D as the minimum acceptable level of service for intersections (i.e., LOS
E and F are considered unacceptable operations). Caltrans has more stringent standards than the City of Paso
Robles and strives to maintain operations at the LOS C/D threshold on state-operated facilities in the study area,
which include US 101 and SR 46. Therefore, LOS C or better is considered acceptable on Caltrans facilities.

Signalized Intersections

For signalized intersections, the LOS methodology described in Chapter 16 of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM) published by the Transportation Research Board was applied. This methodology evaluates a signalized
intersection's operations based on average control delay. Control delay represents delay caused by signal
operation but does not account for delays caused by on-street parking, driveways, pedestrians, and other friction
factors. The average control delay for signalized intersections is calculated using the SYNCHRO analysis
software and is correlated to a LOS designation as shown in Table 1.

methodology contained in Chapter 17 of the 2000 HCM and the TRAFFIX analysis software program. LOS ratings
for stop-sign controlled intersections are based on the average control delay expressed in seconds per vehicle. At
two-way or side street-controlled intersections, the control delay is calculated for each movement, not for the
intersection as a whole. For approaches composed of a single lane, the control delay is computed as the average
of all movements in that lane. For all-way stop-controlled locations, a weighted average delay for the entire
intersection is presented. Table 2 summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized
intersections.

Roadway Segments

Levels of service (LOS) for the roadway segments were evaluated by comparing the measured average daily
traffic (ADT) volume to volume thresholds presented in the City of Paso Robles Circulation Element (General
Plan, 2003) and to volume thresholds presented in Quality/Level of Service Handbook (Florida Department of
Transportation, 2002). Table 3 presents threshold volumes for various roadway types. These threshold volumes
include adjustments for divided and undivided facilities and for roadways with left-turn lanes.

This planning level analysis determines if the study roadway segments are operating below or over capacity.
Because this type of analysis is general in nature and does not take into account delays and other factors
affecting capacity, impacts usually defer to a more detailed operational analysis (intersection and freeway ramp
levels of service).

The study roadway segments are classified as follows:

    ·    SR 46E, between US 101 and west of Airport Road ­ four-lane divided arterial;

    ·    SR 46E, east of Airport Road ­ two lane highway;

    ·    US 101, north of SR 46E to south of SR 46W ­ a four-lane divided freeway;

                                                                                                                    16

    ·    Golden Hill Road, between Dallons Road and Union Road ­ two-lane collector with no left-turn lane;

    ·    Dallons Road, west of Golden Hill Road ­ two-lane collector with no left-turn lane.

The segment of Golden Hill Road is classified as an arterial roadway according to the City's Circulation Element.
Since a volume threshold is not provided for a two-lane arterial road, the volume thresholds for a two-lane
collector road was applied to the Golden Hill Road segment.

Freeway Ramp Junctions

Ramp junction operations were evaluated using the methodology contained in Chapter 21 of the 2000 HCM. The
density is calculated using the HCS+ analysis software and is correlated to a LOS designation for ramp junctions
as shown in Table 4. Density, measured in vehicles per mile per lane, is an measure of the proximity of vehicles
to one another and the motorist's ability to maneuver in on the roadway segment.

EXISTING LEVELS OF SERVICE

Intersections

Existing intersection lane configurations and peak-hour turning movement volumes were used to calculate the
LOS for the study intersections during AM, PM, and Friday PM peak-hours. The results of the LOS analysis for
existing conditions are presented in Table 5. The corresponding calculation sheets are contained in Appendix B.

The US 101/SR 46 E ramps intersections are operating at LOS C during the weekday AM and PM peak hours
and LOS E or F during the Friday PM peak hour. The SR 46E/Golden Hill Road intersection is operating at LOS F
during all peak hours. The side-street movement or approaches for the unsignalized intersection on SR 46 (at
Union Road, Airport Road, Mill Road, and Jardine Road) are operating at LOS F for at least one peak hour. The
Golden Hill Road/Union Road intersection is operating at LOS F during the PM peak hour.

Freeway Ramp Junctions

The AM, PM, and Friday PM peak-hour operations of the US 101 freeway ramp junctions at SR 46 were analyzed
under Existing Conditions. The ramp volumes used in the merge/diverge analysis were obtained from the counts
conducted at the ramp intersections in 2005.

The results of the LOS analysis for existing ramp junctions are presented in Table 7. The corresponding

FIELD OBSERVATIONS
Weekday AM and PM peak-hour field observations were completed in October 2006. Available traffic data was
provided to Fehr & Peers after the traffic counts had been completed. Thus, observations during the traffic count
collection period was not possible. Operations and queuing at the signalized and unsignalized intersections were
observed. The study intersections were generally observed to operate at the calculated levels of service shown in
Table 5.

During the PM peak-hour, queuing in the westbound direction at SR 46 E-24th Street/US 101 SB Ramps was
observed to occur through the SR 46 E/US 101 NB Ramp intersection.

At the SR 46 E/Golden Hill Road intersection, queues of greater than 10 vehicles were observed north and
southbound during the AM and PM peak-hours.

Delays at the unsignalized intersections were typically less than 35 seconds/vehicle. Queuing at the unsignalized
intersections was minimal, typically under 3 vehicles. Due to the low demand on the side streets and platooning
effects from the upstream traffic signals, these intersections were typically observed to operate at acceptable
levels of service. As noted above, the observations were conducted in Fall 2006 and not during Summer 2005
when traffic volumes are typically higher and during the period when the traffic counts were conducted.

 Final Golden Hill Retail Center Transportation Impact Analysis
 June 2007




3. EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
The impacts of the proposed Golden Hill Retail Center (GHRC) project on the surrounding transportation system
under Existing Plus Project Conditions are discussed in this chapter. Existing Plus Project Conditions are defined
as Existing Conditions plus traffic generated by the proposed GHRC project. First, the methodology used to
estimate the amount of traffic generated by the project is described. Then, the results of the level of service (LOS)
calculations for Existing Plus Project are presented. A comparison of roadway operations under Existing and
Existing Plus Project Conditions is presented and the impacts of the project on the study intersections and
roadway segments are discussed. Site access, on-site circulations, and potential impacts to non-automobile
modes are also discussed in this chapter.

PROJECT TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
The amount of traffic added to the roadway system by the proposed development is estimated using a three-step
process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip assignment. The first step estimates the amount of
traffic added to the roadway network. The second step estimates the direction of travel to and from the
development area. The trips are assigned to specific street segments and intersection turning movements during
the third step. The results of this process are described in the following sections.

Trip Generation

The amount of traffic added to the surrounding roadway system by the proposed GHRC project was estimated by
applying land use trip generation rates published in Trip Generation (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 7th
Edition) to the size of the project.

A passby and diverted trip reduction of 25 percent was applied to the retail center (50 percent reduction was
applied to the fast-food restaurants) to account for vehicles that are already traveling on the roadway network
(primarily on SR 46E and Golden Hill Road) and will be expected to divert to the new shopping center. These
passby and diverted trips are not considered new external trips to the study area because they are already
traveling on the roadway network past the project site and these trips are already included in the existing traffic
counts.

A ten (10) percent reduction was also applied to account to internal trips between the retail uses. These internal
trips account for consumers that shop at the general retail stores and then stop at the fast-food restaurants.

The weekday peak-hour trip generation rates and trip estimates are presented in Tables 8 and 9, respectively.
The GHRC project is estimate to generate approximately 12,400 net new daily trips, 720 net new AM peak-hour
trips, and 1,020 net new PM peak-hour trips. The project site is assumed to generate the same number of trips
during the Friday PM peak-hour as the typical weekday PM peak-hour.

 Final Golden Hill Retail Center Transportation Impact Analysis
 June 2007




Trip Distribution

The directions of approach and departure for project traffic were estimated based on the existing travel patterns in
the area, previous studies, and the relative locations of complementary land uses such as residential areas.
Figure 6 illustrates the major directions of approach and departure.

Trip Assignment

The project trips were assigned to the roadway network based on the directions of approach and departure
discussed above. Figure 7 shows the project trips assigned to each turning movement at the study intersections.
These project trips were added to the existing traffic volumes to establish intersection volumes for Existing Plus
Project Conditions shown on Figure 8. Daily project trips were added to the existing average daily traffic (ADT) for
each of the study roadway segments as shown on Figure 9.

EXISTING PLUS PROJECT LEVELS OF SERVICE

Intersections

Intersection levels of service were calculated with the Existing Plus Project volumes to evaluate the operating
conditions of the intersections. The results of the intersection level of service calculations for Existing and Existing
Plus Project Conditions are presented in Table 9. The LOS calculation sheets are included in Appendix B.

With the exception of SR 46/Buena Vista Drive and the two intersections on Dallons Road (at Buena Vista Drive
and at Golden Hill Road), traffic from the proposed project is estimated to degrade the level of service rating or
exacerbate unacceptable LOS E or F operations at all study intersections.

Roadway Segments

The results of the roadway segments level of service analysis for Existing Plus Project Conditions are
summarized in Table 11. The two study segments on SR 46, segment of US 101 between SR 46 E and SR 46W,
and the segment on Golden Hill north of SR 46 are projected to operate at unacceptable levels with the addition
of project traffic. Dallons Road is projected to operate at acceptable levels.

Ramp Junctions

Freeway ramp junction LOS analysis was conducted with traffic added by the project. The results are summarized
in Table 12 and the corresponding calculation sheets are contained in Appendix C. The addition of project traffic
is not projected to degrade the level of service ratings at the ramp junctions between Existing and Existing Plus
Project Conditions. All ramp junctions will continue to operate at acceptable levels.

THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE AND PROJECT IMPACTS

City of Paso Robles

According to the City of Paso Robles Circulation Element (2003), the minimum acceptable Level of Service (LOS)
is LOS D. Since none of the signalized intersections are under the jurisdiction of the City, only unsignalized
intersections are discussed in this sub-section.

Unsignalized Intersections

A significant impact at an unsignalized intersection is defined to occur when the addition of project traffic:

           1. Causes intersection operations for the side-street movement or approach to deteriorate from an
              acceptable level (LOS D or better) to an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) and satisfies the peak-hour
              signal warrant from the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).
           2. Exacerbates unacceptable operations (LOS E or F) and satisfies the peak-hour signal warrant from
              the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).

Based on these impact criteria, the addition of project traffic is estimated to have a significant impact at the
intersection of Golden Hill Road/Union Road.




                                                                                                                     31

Roadway Segments

As noted previously, evaluation of roadway segments is used as a general guide to determine if a street is
operating below or over capacity; in most cases, analysis of the intersections represent the constraint points and
better reflect operating conditions of the roadway. Typically, poor operating conditions on a roadway are due to
capacity constraints at the intersections, and can be mitigated accordingly. Therefore, if a roadway segment
analysis shows poor operating conditions, but individual intersections operate within acceptable standards, the
mitigation measures defer to the intersection. For roadway segments, a degradation in the level of service from an
acceptable level (LOS D or better) to an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) is a significant impact. For segments
already operating at LOS E or F without the project, the addition of any project traffic to that location is considered
a significant impact.

Golden Hill Road is projected to degrade to an unacceptable level of service under Existing Plus Project
Conditions. Thus, the project's impact to this City of Paso Robles roadway segment is significant.

Caltrans

Signalized Intersections and Ramp Junctions

A degradation in the level of service from an acceptable level (LOS C or better) to an unacceptable level (LOS D,
E, or F) is considered to be a significant impact. For those facilities already operating at LOS D, E, or F without
the project, the addition of any project traffic to that location is considered a significant impact.

The signalized intersection of SR 46/Buena Vista Drive operates at acceptable levels of service under Project
Conditions. The addition of project traffic is estimated to have a significant impact on the following signalized
intersections:

    ·   SR 46/US 101 SB Ramps (Friday PM peak-hour)

    ·   SR 46/US 101 NB Ramps (Friday PM peak-hour)

    ·   SR 46/Golden Hill Road (Weekday AM and PM peak-hours and Friday PM peak-hour)

All US 101/SR 46E ramp junctions are estimated to operate at acceptable levels of service under Project
Conditions. No significant impacts to any of the ramp junctions are projected.

Unsignalized Intersections

The significance impact criteria presented above for unsignalized City of Paso Robles intersections was applied to
unsignalized intersections on SR 46. The project traffic is projected to have a significant impact at the following
locations:

    ·   SR 46/Union Road (Weekday AM and PM peak-hours and Friday PM peak-hour)

    ·   SR 46/Airport Road (Weekday PM peak-hour and Friday PM peak-hour)

    ·   SR 46/Jardine Road (Weekday AM and PM peak-hours and Friday PM peak-hour)

The unsignalized intersection of SR 46/Mill Road is projected to operate at unacceptable levels during the AM,
PM, and Friday PM peak-hours, however, the MUTCD peak-hour signal warrant is not satisfied and the project's
impact to this location is considered less-than-significant. Appendix D contains the peak-hour warrant.


                                                                                                                    32
 Final Golden Hill Retail Center Transportation Impact Analysis
 June 2007




It should be noted that the MUTCD contains seven other warrants that should be considered when determining
the need for a traffic signal. The peak-hour signal warrant analysis should not serve as the only basis for deciding
whether and when to install a signal. To reach such a decision, the full set of warrants should be investigated
based on a thorough study of traffic and roadway conditions. The decision to install a signal should not be based
solely upon the warrants, since the installation of signals can lead to certain types of collisions. Caltrans shall
make the final determination on the need for a signal at this location since SR 46 is a state-maintained roadway.

Freeway and Roadway Segments

The analysis of Caltrans roadway and freeway segments were analyzed using the City of Paso Robles
significance criteria as described above. The addition of project traffic is estimated to have a significant impact on
the two-lane segment of SR 46 east of Airport Road and on the segment of US 101, between SR 46E and SR
46W. All other roadway segments are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service.

Transit Impacts

Impacts to transit are considered significant if the proposed project will conflict with existing or planned transit
facilities or will generate potential transit trips and will not provide adequate facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists
to access transit routes and stops.

The proposed retail development is estimated to generate transit demand from City of Paso Robles residents as
both patrons and employees. However, direct transit service to the site is not provided. Thus, the project impact to
the transit facilities is considered potentially significant.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Impacts

An impact to pedestrians and bicyclists would be considered significant if implementation of the proposed project
will conflict with existing or planned bicycle facilities or will generate pedestrian and bicycle demand without
providing adequate and appropriate facilities for safe non-motorized mobility.

On-site pedestrian circulation is generally adequate and direct. Pedestrian crosswalks are proposed on-site to
provide a connection between the parking aisles and the retail buildings. The project will include sidewalks along
its frontage on Dallons Road and Golden Hill Road. According to the City of Paso Robles' Bikeway Master Plan
(2002), bike lanes are designated on Golden Hill Road and a bike path is designated on Dallons Road. The
project will be widening and constructing improvements on Golden Hill Road and Dallons Road adjacent to the
site. These improvements shall not preclude construction of the planned bike facilities as outlined in the Bikeway
Master Plan.

Thus, the proposed project is estimated to have a less-than-significant impact to existing and planned pedestrian
and bicycle facilities.




                                                                                                                        33

PROJECT MITIGATION MEASURES

Intersections

The following intersection improvements were identified to mitigate significant impacts. The resulting mitigated
delays and levels of service with implementation of these improvements are presented in Table 13. The
corresponding calculation sheets are included in Appendix B. The project applicant will contribute their fair share
costs towards some of these mitigation measures through payment of the City of Paso Robles development
impact fee program. The last column identifies the percentage of project traffic over the total intersection volume
for each peak hour. These percentages are not typically associated with "fair-share" cost percentages because
Caltrans use a different formula to calculate project responsibility.

City of Paso Robles

    ·   Golden Hill Road/Union Road ­ The City of Paso Robles has adopted a plan line for this intersection. The
        plan line includes a one-lane roundabout with flared northbound and southbound right-turn lanes. As
        shown in Table 13, a roundabout will provide LOS A operations during both AM and PM peak-hours. As a
        fair-share contribution, the project applicant will be responsible for the design of the roundabout at this

    ·   SR 46/US 101 SB Ramps ­ The addition of a second westbound left-turn lane and third eastbound
        through lane will provide acceptable LOS B operations during the weekday AM and PM peak hours. This
        intersection is projected to operate at LOS D during the Friday peak-hour. The proposed improvement
        includes widening of the southbound on-ramp to provide two receiving lanes. According to Caltrans staff,
        environmental review for this improvement is underway and scheduled to be completed by the end of the
        year.

    ·   SR 46/US 101 NB Ramps ­ With the proposed second westbound left-turn lane at the US 101 SB Ramp
        intersection, two additional westbound through lanes are provided at this intersection. These new
        westbound through lanes will lead directly into the westbound left-turn lanes at the southbound ramp
        intersection. With this improvement, the intersection will operate at acceptable levels of service (LOS C)
        during all peak-hours.

    ·   SR 46/Golden Hill Road ­ The SR 46/Golden Hill intersection needs to be widened to provide the
        following configuration:

            o    Two left-turn lanes, one through lane, and one shared through/right-turn lane (northbound)

            o    Two left-turn lanes, one through lane, and one right-turn lane (southbound)

            o    Two left-turn lanes, two through lanes, and one right-turn lane (eastbound and westbound)

        Modification to the existing traffic signal timings and phasing will be required. These improvements will
        substantially improve the level of service rating (LOS F to LOS D).

    ·   SR 46/Union Road ­ The restriction of northbound left-turns from Union Road to west SR 46 will provide
        acceptable levels of service on the side street (Union Road) during all peak-hours. Vehicles currently
        turning left from Union Road will be required to travel west and utilize the signalized intersection at SR


                                                                                                                34

       46/Golden Hill Road to make a left-turn. Approximately 30 or fewer vehicles during each peak-hour will be
       affected.

     ·     SR 46/Airport Road ­ SR 46 currently narrows from four lanes to two lanes east of Airport Road. Caltrans
           is preparing environmental documentation for a project to widen SR 46, east of Airport Road, to provide
           two travel lanes in each direction to the Shandon rest stop. The widening plans include acceleration and
           deceleration lanes to improve merging maneuvers for left- and right-turning vehicles from the side streets
           (at Airport Road, Mill Road, Jardine Road) with SR 46 traffic. This project is expected to start construction
           in 2008. With these proposed improvements, the side street movements will operate with lower vehicular
           delays when compared to Existing Conditions.

     ·     SR 46/Jardine Road ­ As noted above, acceleration and deceleration lanes will be provided at this
           location with the SR 46 Widening project. With these proposed improvements, the side street movements
           will operate with lower vehicular delays when compared to Existing Conditions.

Roadway Segments

The SR 46 Widening project discussed above will provide two travel lanes in each direction and improve the level
of service along SR 46 to LOS A east of Airport Road. Golden Hill Road, north of SR 46, will be widened to
provide two travel lanes in each direction. As part of the dual left-turn lane improvements at the US 101/SR 46E
interchange, a southbound auxiliary lane will be provided on US 101 between SR 46E and 16th Street to provide
additional capacity on US 101. These improvements are sufficient to mitigate the project's impact on the roadway
segments.

Freeway Ramp Junctions

No significant impacts to the freeway ramp junctions were identified, thus no mitigation measures are proposed.

Transit Facilities

The project sponsor shall coordinate with San Luis Obispo Regional Transit Authority (RTA) and the City of Paso
Robles to provide transit service to the site. Since the North County Shuttle stops near the site, at the northeast
corner of the Buena Vista Drive/Dallons Road intersection, the bus route could be adjusted to operate on Dallons


                                                                                                                                              36
 Final Golden Hill Retail Center Transportation Impact Analysis

Road. The appropriate location for a bus stop along the project frontage shall be determined in consultation with
City and RTA staff. The existing transit stop on the east side of Golden Hill may be relocated to Dallons Road.
With the above recommendations, the project's impacts are mitigated to a less-than-significant level.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities

As noted in the previous section, the widening plans on Dallons Road and Golden Hill Road shall not preclude
construction of future bicycle facilities. Bike lanes are to be provided along the east side of Golden Hill Road north
of SR 46, and along the west side of Golden Hill Road between Dallons Road and the project driveway. As
directed by the City of Paso Robles staff, the 10-foot wide sidewalk on the west side of Golden Hill Road between
the project driveway and SR 46 is to be maintained, and the bike lane will transition to a signed bike route (Class
III facility). Thus the project's impacts to the bicycle and pedestrian facilities are less-than-significant, and no
mitigation is required.

Other Mitigation Measures

To allow for the addition of a third lane in each direction on SR 46 or to upgrade this facility to a freeway, the
project applicant has agreed to provide a 30-foot easement to the City of Paso Robles along the southern project
frontage. This easement will provide sufficient right-of-way to accommodate future improvements to SR 46. A
discussion of when these future improvements are needed is presented in the next two chapters.

SITE ACCESS AND ON-SITE CIRCULATION
The site plan (dated November 20, 2006) for the proposed project is shown on Figure 2. Access to the site will be
provided via one driveway on Golden Hill Road and three driveways on Dallons Road. The majority of the project
traffic is estimated to utilize the Golden Hill Road driveway due to the roadway's direct connection to SR 46 East.
The number of proposed driveways is sufficient to accommodate the total number of trips generated by the
project.

The site plan is oriented with the majority of parking spaces located in the center of the site. The larger retail
buildings are oriented along the northern border of the site with the smaller retail pads and restaurants located
along the southern border and adjacent to the gas stations. A main east-west aisle bisects the site and leads
directly to the Golden Hill Road driveway. A secondary east-west aisle provides direct access to the smaller retail
buildings and restaurants. Due to the location of the loading docks for the large retail buildings, primary truck
access is proposed from Dallons Road.

The original site plan was modified to include the following improvements recommended by Fehr & Peers (site
plan dated March 8, 2007):

    1. Parking was eliminated in front of Majors 3 and 4 so that vehicles entering or exiting will not conflict with
       traffic on the main aisle.

    2. An all-way stop at the internal intersection located southeast of the Garden Center was provided.

Golden Hill Road/Project Driveway Traffic Control

A review of the peak-hour volumes was conducted at the main project driveway on Golden Hill Road to determine
the appropriate traffic control device (e.g. stop control, traffic signal, or roundabout). The projected volumes meet
the requirements of the MUTCD peak-hour signal warrant. The main driveway is projected to operate at LOS B
with a traffic signal under Existing Plus Project Conditions.


                                                                                                                   37
 Final Golden Hill Retail Center Transportation Impact Analysis

City staff requested a single-lane roundabout be considered as the traffic control for the main driveway location,
and directed that the roundabout be centered around two large oak trees on the eastern side of the site. Fehr &
Peers investigated the feasibility of a roundabout at this location. However, based on planning-level daily volumes
from Roundabouts: An Informational Guide (Federal Highway Administration, Publication No. FHWA-RD-00-067),
a two-lane roundabout is needed to serve the Project volumes and traffic from future approved and pending
projects (see next chapter for discussion of future approved and pending projects). According to Roundabouts, a
two-lane roundabout has a typical inscribed diameter of 180 feet. Implementation of a two-lane roundabout would
require substantial right-of-way on both sides of Golden Hill Road and would impact existing residences and
businesses. Thus, the City did not consider a roundabout as a feasible traffic control device at this location.

Golden Hill Road and Dallons Road Improvement Plans

Conceptual roadway improvement plans were prepared on Golden Hill Road (between SR 46 and Dallons Road)
and on Dallons Road (between the western project boundary and Golden Hill Road). Figures 10a and 10b present
these conceptual plans, and a text description of design issues is presented below.

Golden Hill Road

As shown on Figure 10a, two travel lanes with bike lanes in each direction are proposed on Golden Hill Road
between SR 46 and Dallons Road. The four-lane section tapers to match the existing cross-sections on Golden
Hill north of Dallons Road and south of SR 46. The improvement plans also incorporate the proposed lane
improvements at the SR 46/Golden Hill Road intersection that were discussed above as mitigation.

Due to the number and location of existing gas station driveways on Golden Hill Road between the main driveway
and SR 46, City of Paso Robles staff indicated that a raised median on Golden Hill is required to minimize vehicle
conflicts. The raised median will require outbound gas station traffic on the east side of Golden Hill Road,
outbound Wallace Drive traffic, and inbound gas station traffic on the west side of Golden Hill Road to make U-
turns at the proposed signalized main driveway. Two left-turn lanes at the project driveway are proposed to
accommodate U-turning traffic and inbound project traffic. The existing outbound gas station driveway would be
required to realign opposite the project driveway to create the east leg of the signalized intersection. To
accommodate larger inbound vehicles at the Pacific Pride gas station, trucks, buses, and recreational vehicles
would be required to turn left into the project site and use a shared driveway on the main circulation aisle.

A review of the operations on Golden Hill Road between SR 46 and Dallons Road was conducted using the
Synchro software program. The purpose of this supplemental analysis is to determine whether vehicles would
spill back between the project driveway and SR 46. Based on the Synchro results, vehicles traveling north on
Golden Hill Road and into the project site are not expected to spill back to SR 46. Similarly, southbound vehicle
queues on Golden Hill Road at SR 46 are not projected to extend back to the project driveway.

Dallons Road

Figure 10b presents the improvement plan on Dallons Road. One lane of travel is proposed on Dallons Road with
a center two-way left-turn lane. Left-turn lanes are proposed at the two western driveways. An eastbound bicycle

the north side of Dallons Road occurs.

4. NEAR-TERM (YEAR 2010) CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS
This chapter presents an analysis of Near-Term Cumulative Conditions. Near-Term Conditions represent traffic
growth to Year 2010 which accounts for buildout of the project, construction of one pending and all approved
projects near the site, and future growth in the SR 46 corridor.

NEAR-TERM CUMULATIVE TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
According to Caltrans District 5 staff, volumes on SR 46, west of Jardine Road, have increased by 4.1 percent per
year between 1993 and 2006. The existing segment volumes on SR 46, west of Jardine Road, were multiplied by
20.5 percent (representing five years of growth at 4.1 percent per year from 2005). The added growth was
assigned through the SR 46 corridor and added to the Existing volumes to establish Near-Term baseline traffic
volumes. This approach was requested by Caltrans and represents a conservative estimate of traffic.

The following list of approved and pending projects, developed in consultation with City of Paso Robles and
Caltrans staff, was included under Near-Term Conditions:

      ·    Projects located on Airport Road

            o    Robert Shannon (Tract 2594)--17.46 acres

            o    Ole Viborg/Don Thiessen--27,500 s.f.

    ·   Links Industrial/Office--154,000 s.f. of industrial and office development on Jardine Road (pending)

Daily, AM peak-hour, and PM peak-hour traffic estimates for the above projects were obtained either from their
respective traffic studies or from Caltrans and added to the Near-Term baseline volumes to represent Near-Term
Condition volumes. The Near-Term intersection volumes are presented on Figure 11. Daily project trips were
added to the existing average daily traffic (ADT) for each of the study roadway segments as shown on Figure 12.

NEAR-TERM CUMULATIVE ROADWAY NETWORK
The existing roadway geometry was assumed for near-term cumulative conditions.

NEAR-TERM CUMULATIVE LEVELS OF SERVICE

Intersections

Levels of service were calculated under Near-Term Cumulative volumes to evaluate the operating conditions of
the intersection. When intersections operate at congested levels (i.e. LOS E or F), the number of vehicles that
travel through the intersection is constant and evenly distributed throughout the entire peak-hour. Thus, the peak-
hour factor was increased to 0.95 for all study intersections under this scenario to reflect this condition.

The results of the intersection level of service calculations are presented in Table 14. The LOS calculation sheets
are included in Appendix B. All study intersections except Buena Vista Drive/Dallons Road and Golden Hill
Road/Dallons Road, are projected to operate at unacceptable levels (LOS E or F for at least the PM peak hour)
under Near-Term Conditions with the existing roadway geometry.

Roadway Segments

The results of the roadway segments level of service analysis for Near-Term Cumulative Conditions are
summarized in Table 15. Both segments of SR 46, between US 101 and Airport Road, and east of Airport Road,
and the segment of US 101 between SR 46E and SR 46W are projected to operate at unacceptable levels. The
other roadway segments are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service.

Ramp Junctions

Freeway ramp junction merge/diverge analysis was conducted for the study ramps with the added traffic from the
Near-Term projects. The results are summarized in Table 16, and the corresponding calculation sheets are
contained in Appendix C. The US 101/SR 46 ramp junctions are projected to operate at acceptable levels (LOS C
or better).

NEAR-TERM CUMULATIVE MITIGATION MEASURES

Intersections

Table 14 presents the mitigated level of service calculations under Near-Term Conditions with the mitigation
measures identified under Existing Plus Project Conditions. Additional mitigation measures beyond those
identified in the previous chapter are presented to provide improved operations. The last column identifies the
percentage of project traffic over the total intersection volume for each peak hour. These percentages are not
typically associated with "fair-share" cost percentages because Caltrans use a different formula to calculate
project responsibility.

City of Paso Robles

   ·    Golden Hill Road/Union Road ­ The addition of a second circulating lane in the roundabout will provide
        acceptable operations. This mitigation will likely require additional right-of-way acquisition.

Caltrans

   ·    SR 46/US 101 SB Ramps ­ Re-optimization of the signal timings and the splits for each phase will
        provide LOS C or better operations during the weekday AM and PM peak hours. This improvement will be
        made in conjunction with the proposed mitigation at the SR 46/US 101 NB Ramps (see below). This
        intersection is projected to operate at LOS E, however, the mitigated delay will be lower than Existing
        Conditions.

   ·    SR 46/US 101 NB Ramps ­ The widening of the northbound off-ramp structure to provide dual
        northbound right-turn lanes will provide LOS C or better operations during all peak hours. The approach
        will contain one shared left-turn/through lane and two right-turn lanes.

   ·    SR 46/Buena Vista Drive ­ The addition of a westbound right-turn lane and dual eastbound left-turn lanes
        will provide LOS C operations.

   ·    SR 46/Golden Hill Road ­ The addition of a third eastbound and westbound through lane is required to
        provide improved intersection operations. The intersection is projected to operate at LOS D or E but the
        mitigated delays are less than Existing Conditions. As noted in the previous chapter, the project applicant
        is providing an easement along the southern project frontage to accommodate widening of SR 46 or
        conversion of SR 46 to a freeway.

   ·    SR 46/Union Road ­ The addition of an eastbound acceleration lane for the northbound right-turn is
        recommended to reduce delays for vehicles to turn from Union Road to eastbound SR 46. Applying
        guidelines from the Caltrans' Highway Design Manual, a 700-foot acceleration lane should be provided.
        The acceleration lane will terminate prior to the Huerhuero Creek overcrossing. With the acceleration
        lane, the SR 46/Union Road intersection is projected to operate at LOS C during weekdays, and LOS D
        during the Friday PM peak hour.

   ·    SR 46/Airport Road ­ The projected peak-hour volumes at this location meet the minimum volume
        thresholds for the MUTCD peak-hour signal warrant. While a signal could be constructed at this location,
        the north leg of the intersection would have to be substantially widened and re-constructed with retaining
        walls to accommodate up to four lanes (two receiving lanes for dual eastbound left-turns and one lane
        each for southbound left-turn and right-turn).. According to Caltrans District 5 staff, a traffic signal would
        conflict with long-term plans for grade separation at this location. Thus, Caltrans is requesting grade

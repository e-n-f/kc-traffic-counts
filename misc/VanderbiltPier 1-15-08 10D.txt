                              Executive Summary

Review the recently completed Vanderbilt Recreational Pier Feasibility
Study and obtain direction from the Board of County Commissioners
on how to proceed.


Objective: Obtain direction from the Board of County Commissioners on how to
proceed with the recently completed Vanderbilt Recreational Pier Feasibility Study.
Considerations: On June 26, 2007 the Board of County Commissioners approved a
feasibility study to build a Recreational Pier at Vanderbilt Beach. This study is
completed and contains the following elements:

   ·   Technical report by Coastal Planning and Engineering (CP&E) discussing layout,
       permitting, costs, potential mitigation requirements and timeframe.
   ·   An alternative phased approach which would construct critical public restrooms,
       offices, and snack bar/restaurant facilities to be built now and accommodate
       future pier construction.
   ·   A traffic study conducted by Johnson Engineering on the impact this installation
       would have on the surrounding roadway infrastructure.
   ·   A parking study conducted by Parks & Recreation analyzing parking capacity at
       the Vanderbilt Beach Parking Garage.
   ·   A Crime analysis of the Naples Pier over the last 3 years with supporting
       documentation from Naples elected officials.
This report has not been reviewed, vetted or discussed with the public or any Advisory
Boards. In addition to presenting this report, direction is requested from the Board of
County Commissioners on how to proceed and what public organizations this report
should be reviewed and discussed with.
Report Summaries and Conclusions:
CP&E Technical Report:
A recreational pier suitable for fishing and other uses can be constructed at the end of
Vanderbilt Beach road entirely within county owned right-of-way. This pier would be
930 feet in length from the Erosion Control Line (ECL) and encompass 1,060 feet at full
deck length. It would have a width of 22 feet to accommodate emergency vehicles and be
20 foot off the water. The structural portions of the pier would be designed to withstand
a minimum 20 year storm based on FDEP state wide data. More probably, our design
would resist a 50 year storm based on local data. A site specific wave height study would
be required as part of the final design to determine this. Decking and handrail would be
of wood/composite material and designed to be sacrificial during significant storm
events. 3,700 SF of public restrooms, offices and snack bar/restaurant along with 1,700
SF of deck area adjacent to the snack bar/restaurant is included in this project. These
facilities will be elevated and constructed directly above the existing Vanderbilt Beach
                                                                              Agenda Item No. 10D
                                                                                 January 15, 2008
                                                                                    Page 2 of 119


turnaround. These facilities, especially the public restrooms are critically needed.
Replacement of existing public facilities will require elevated structure design to comply
with revised FEMA guidelines.
Permitting for this project is possible and can be accomplished within 24 months.
Permitting will be accomplished in phases with the overall site permit secured first. This
pier will extend 380 feet over critical hardbottom habitat that will complicate the
permitting process. FDEP has provided a wealth of information on the content of a pier
application but not much on the permittability of building a pier over hardbottom.
History however is on our side; all 6 recent pier projects throughout the state have been
permitted. Some have required administrative hearings after initial applications have
been rejected to be permitted.
Although we will modify our design when practical to avoid critical habitat, some
mitigation will be required. $1,250,000 has been allotted in our construction cost
estimate to fund mitigation and monitoring that FDEP will require. We believe that this
is sufficient especially when viewed in combination with the recently constructed and
unutilized one acre artificial reef. Examples of mitigation activities that the FDEP might
require are the relocation of existing coral outcroppings and coral growth monitoring.
After permitting, which may require 2 years; this project can be constructed in 18
months. Overall preliminary cost estimates for the pier, site development, restrooms,
offices, snack bar/restaurant along with the engineering, permits, mitigation and
monitoring is estimated at approximately $8,640,000. These costs are broken down as
follows:

    ·   Pier engineering, permitting and construction mgt -         $ 800,000
    ·   Pier construction -                                         $3,950,000
    ·   Facilities engineering, permitting and construction mgt -   $ 280,000
    ·   Restrooms, offices, snack bar/restaurant construction -     $2,360,000
    ·   Mitigation and monitoring -                                 $1,250,000
Funding would be from Beach Park Facilities Fund (183) utilizing Tourist Development
Taxes. The next step in the appropriation process would be to authorize $330,000 to fund
the preliminary design, permitting and request for additional information by FDEP to
secure the permits. Sufficient reserves are budgeted in Beach Park Facilities Fund (183)
to fund the $330,000 contract for Preliminary Design. Note that reserves are not
sufficient to fund the entire project as estimated above.
Alternative Approach ­ Construct public restrooms, offices, and snack
bar/restaurant facilities now:
In development of this feasibility study, it became obvious that a phased approach could
be possible. If phased, this project would construct the restrooms, offices, snack
bar/restaurant and deck overlook now while planning for and verifying that the pier can
be constructed some time in the future. The restrooms, offices, snack bar/restaurant and
deck overlook would be a stand-alone elevated structure; positioned directly above the
existing Vanderbilt Beach turn-around as depicted on sheets 7 and 11 of the proposed
layout drawings.

                                                                                  January 15, 2008
                                                                                     Page 3 of 119




The benefit of the approach would be to provide critically needed facilities now that tie
into a master plan and expand public beach access and use. The existing public
bathrooms at Vanderbilt Beach are inadequate and in need of expansion and replacement.
Any significant work on these bathrooms will require elevated construction to comply
with recently revised FEMA flood guidelines. A significant investment must be spent in
the near future to expand/replace these bathrooms. Adding the offices and snack
bar/restaurant to the bathrooms provides the needed facilities, eliminates stand alone
capital spending and preserves our ability to build a pier structure in the future.
Permitting for this facility would be significantly simpler than a combined pier/facility
project and most probably could be accomplished within 12 months. Construction could
be accomplished in an additional 12 months making the total project duration 2 years.
Some ramp rework would be required if a pier was constructed in the future. Estimated
costs for this alternate would be $2,640,000 and broken down as follows:
     ·   Engineering, permitting and construction mgt -             $ 280,000
     ·   Building, deck and ramp construction -                     $2,160,000
     ·   Site development, utilities, signage and landscaping -     $ 200,000
The next step in the appropriation process would be to authorize funds for design and
permitting to secure the permits, confirm the costs, engineer the project and obtain bids
for funding the construction. Sufficient reserves are budgeted in Beach Park Facilities
Fund (183) to fund the $330,000 contract for Preliminary Design. Reserves may be
sufficient to fund this alternative depending upon overall project expenditures within the
Beach Park Facilities fund (183).
Traffic Study
A traffic study conducted by Johnson Engineering on the impact additional pier traffic
would have on the surrounding roadway infrastructure indicated that at build-out in 2009,
county concurrency segments and non-concurrency segments will operate at acceptable
levels of service and that the county's minimum level of service Standard D will be
maintained. This study was based on direct traffic counts from the Naples Pier.
Parking Study
A parking study conducted by Parks & Recreation staff indicated that sufficient capacity
exists in the existing Vanderbilt Beach Parking Garage to accommodate additional
parking requirements of this proposed pier. Since beginning operation in March 2006,
the Vanderbilt Beach Parking Garage averages only 4 times per month when parking
capacity is reached and only averages closure for 29 minutes per occurrence usually
between 10:30 am to 1:30 pm. March and April appear to be the busiest months with 13
to 16 closures occurring and averaging only 30 minutes per closure.
Naples Pier Crime Study
Several concerns were voiced relative to the increased crime that this type of facility
would bring into the area. A review of the City of Naples police reports for the entire
area surrounding the Naples Pier for the last 3 years did not support the implied concerns.
Emails from Mayor Barnett and Vice Mayor Nocera also strongly support this position
                                                                               Agenda Item No. 10D
                                                                                  January 15, 2008
                                                                                     Page 4 of 119


indicating that the pier has been a very popular asset to the community with limited
problems. The vast majority of the police reports were for fishing infractions like fishing
with more that one pole or undersize catches. A summary of all infractions for the last 3
years is as follows:

Infractions                                   2005      2006      2007
Fishing and other infractions                 42        61        61
Possession of Alcohol/Controlled Substance    12        20        19
Theft                                         5         5         4
Disorderly Conduct                            2         4         7
Robbery                                       0         0         1
Criminal Mischief                             1         4         2
Burglary                                      2         7         1
Traffic/Speeding                              0         3         0
Battery/Fighting                              1         2         0
Trespass                                      3         1         0
Total Police Reports                          68        107       95

Advisory Committee Recommendations: No Advisory Committees or public
groups/organizations have reviewed this feasibility study.
County Attorney Findings: The County Attorney has not reviewed or approved this
item for form or legal sufficiency.
Fiscal Impact: The source of these funds will be Category "A" Beach Park Facilities
Fund (183), Tourist Development Tax. Current budgeted Beach Park Facility Fund
reserves total $1,924,800. While sufficient to fund preliminary design, a combination of
reserves and other financing sources will be necessary to proceed with construction.
A budget amendment is necessary moving dollars from Fund (183) reserves to the
appropriate Fund (183) project in order to fund any preliminary design contract.
Growth Management Impact: Depending on the approach and direction provided by
the Board of County Commissioners the impact to the Growth Management Plan may
vary. However, any approach taken will be consistent with the Conservation and Coastal
Management Element Policies supporting Objective 10.3 that addresses developed
coastal barriers and shorelines.
Recommendation: Obtain direction from the Board of County Commissioners on how to
proceed with the recently completed Vanderbilt Recreational Pier Feasibility Study.

                       Vanderbilt Recreational Pier Feasibility Study

The purpose of the feasibility study is to describe the design, permitting, scheduling and cost
aspects of a project to build a pier at Vanderbilt Beach. The report was prepared as a planning
and decision document. A proposed layout of the project was developed and is provided in
Figure 1 and Sheets 1-11 at the end of this report. We suggest a two phase permit application
approach. The first phase to be submitted for site approval, and the second phase for approval of
technical design. Without site approval, investments into technical design would be excessive.

Bridge Design Associates, Inc. is the structural engineer for the project and Coastal Planning &
Engineering, Inc. provides coastal engineering and permitting services. An architect, and civil
and geotechnical engineer will be needed to round out the design team.

The end of Vanderbilt Beach Road is the only location in northern Collier County that has beach
parking, public access and County owned property needed to support a recreational pier for
county residents and visitors in northern Collier County. The County parking garage is a unique
public structure supporting access to the beach. Collier County needs this type of facility to
support the population growth in northern Collier County. No practical alternative is available.
A pier the size of Naples' is desired. The proposed pier length will be 930 feet from the
shoreline (ECL), and it will extend 380 feet over the hardbottom habitat regions mapped
immediately offshore of the Vanderbilt Beach Road access point (vicinity of R-29). A shorter
pier would not meet the County's needs.

This feasibility report describes the hardbottom substrate based on new and existing
investigations, along with the subsurface conditions. A moderately detailed examination of the
hardbottom habitat was an add on to this year's marine sidescan survey and groundtruthing work.
Permittability is analyzed based on consultation with permit agencies and their actual practices
on recent projects in Florida. Ultimately, it is not known how the agencies will treat the unique
conditions at Vanderbilt Pier. The report includes a construction and total project cost estimate
along with a list of tasks needed to bring the project to construction.

Site Location

The siting of the pier is illustrated on Figure 1 and on plan Sheets 1-11 at the end of this report.
The landward pier extension and the restaurant complex (facility) are located entirely within the
Vanderbilt Beach Road right of way (Figure 1). The County owns the land to the south
(Appendix G), where the parking garage is located. This property cannot be used as the piers'
landward end given the deed restrictions which requires third party approval for any
improvements. The County does not have a specific setback that pertains to a pier under these
land use circumstances. A 30 foot setback is provided from the northern property and a nominal
6 foot setback is provided from the County property to the south.

The offshore portion of the pier is positioned to minimize hardbottom impact. The pier extends
over 380 feet of hardbottom that terminates in a bare spot surrounded by offshore hardbottom.
This bare spot was verified by a sidescan survey (Appendix C) and a diver investigation along
the pier alignment. The plan is to conduct sufficient mapping of hardbottom point resources, so
that the pier placement will avoid or minimize impact to the coral species before mitigation is
proposed.

The pier includes a landward facility containing restrooms for the beach, an office and a small
restaurant. The complex has been situated to FDEP guidance provided during the pre-
application meeting. Only water dependent buildings can be located on the pier seaward of the
ECL, which excludes a restaurant. The complex has been positioned within the seaward and
landward alignment of adjacent development, landward of the ECL and will be elevated to meet
CCCL building requirements.

Design Criteria, Risk and Water Levels

The State requires a pier to be designed to withstand the 20-year storm event.

CHAPTER 62B-33 :(k) Fishing or ocean piers or the extension of existing fishing or ocean piers shall be designed to
withstand at a minimum the erosion, scour, and loads accompanying a twenty (20)-year storm event. Pier decking
and rails may be designed to be an expendable structure. Major structures constructed on the pier shall be designed
for the wind loads as set forth in the FBC.

The pier deck elevation should be designed for the 20-year storm elevation or 20 feet NAVD,
since a deck any higher is undesirable for fishing. The State values (Appendix D) put the lowest
horizontal structural member at 21.7 ft NGVD for the 100 year storm, and the equivalent 20-year
storm level is also very high. In Figure 2 shown below, the measured 20-year return tide value is
a couple of feet lower than that predicted by NOAA or Dean, even with adjustment for set up.
After consultation with Ralph Clark (Appendix D), FDEP will provide the County the
opportunity to reevaluate the design water level and wave height, so that a 20 year or higher
design level can be achieved at the 20 foot deck height.

It is the structural engineers' intent to maximize the pier strength without compromising its
purpose as a fishing and recreational pier. Loads caused by a 20-year and 50-year storm wave
will be analyzed. With the results from the new storm water level and wave height study, it
should be feasible to achieve or approach a 50-year design level for all design parameters.

The pictures provided below illustrate the pier design challenges and features. In Photo 1, storm
waves have reached the elevation of the lowest cross-member and deck of the pier, and frangible
deck features have been lost as a means of protecting the core structure. The pier deck will blow
out in the design storm. Photo 2 shows where the deck has been knocked out by the waves and
the cross-members have been lost on a couple of pile bents. The pier deck will be designed to be
sacrificial, but the cross-members will be designed to survive the design storm.




Photographs 1 and 2 illustrate classic pier failure modes.

The engineering should be accomplished in two phases, the first to define the elevations for
critical pier components, and the second to conduct the wave force analysis and design of the
structural members.

Engineering and Technical Analysis

Engineering and Technical Analysis can be broken down into 3 main areas: coastal and
hydraulic engineering, structural engineering and geology/geotechnical engineering. Ralph
Clark provided the following guidance (Appendix A) on the engineering and technical
calculations required for permit review by the FDEP (July 2007) based on his initial review of
the Panama City Beaches recent pier project:

Wave height computations
Wave loads
Structural design computations
Design erosion and scour for 20 year storm
Geotechnical analysis
Pile tip elevations
Computations for pile breakout resistance

A precursor investigation is needed to determine the storm surge plus wave height elevation
needed to design the pier decks, so that they can be reviewed and approved by FDEP prior to
detailed design.




Photograph 3: Dania Pier was originally built over hardbottom. The pier includes a terminal t-
section and a landward facility built on the deck.

Permitting

The procedures for permitting a pier are well defined, with the process generally leading to a
permit, but changes must be expected to reach agreement with the permit agencies. A pre-permit
application meeting was conducted with FDEP, and the results are summarized in Appendix A.
The FDEP provided a wealth of information on the content of a pier permit application, but not

much on the permittability of building a pier over a hardbottom habitat. Piers built over
hardbottom are not unusual, since there are a number of them on the east coast such as Dania
Pier in Broward County (Photograph 3). An e-mail requesting advice on this issue was sent to
all the pertinent permit agencies, and only one answer was received from NOAA Fisheries
(Appendix B). Their response was similar to FDEP's guidelines where it provided instruction on
how to permit the project. It is normal for the agencies to avoid making significant comments
until they fully understand the environmental conditions at the site, which could take until late in
the permit process at the 2nd requests for additional information stage. This is a means to control
or limit their work load.

The best strategy for permitting this project while minimizing expensive engineering and
environmental services is to do a two phase permitting process. The first phase would be to
provide a plan layout similar to plan Sheets 1-11, along with sufficient engineering and natural
resources information. The permit would be accompanied with a request to submit the detailed
engineering and design (as requested by Ralph Clark) with the plans and specifications at a later
date. In essence, the first submittal would be for site approval, while the second phase would be
for approval of the technical design.

Sidescan Survey Geotechnical Investigation Results

Coastal Planning & Engineering geologists conducted a nearshore sidescan survey off of Collier
County on June 15 and 16, 2007. The results of the survey covered the proposed pier location
and are provided in Appendix C. Included in the figures are comparisons to the diver verified
hardbottom edge of 2006 and the nearshore sidescan survey conducted in 2003.

During the sidescan sonar survey conducted in June 2007, a number of possible and probable
hardbottom areas were interpreted from the sidescan sonar data. These sites were verified using
scuba diver groundtruthing. These operations were conducted using DGPS positions integrated
into the HYPACKMAX® program. Target transects were laid out based on sidescan interpretations
and generally oriented across transitions between what was interpreted as sandy bottoms and
potential rock outcrops or other identified features of interest. The entire hardbottom extended
along the proposed pier alignment was diver investigated. This operation was integrated with the
annual monitoring program.

A sub-surface investigation was conducted by a geotechnical sub-contractor at the edge of the
beach to determine the substrate for the pier piles. The findings were similar to those found
during the foundation investigation for the County garage. The top 28 feet consisted of various
qualities of sand, with some rocks found at 18.5' below the surface (Appendix C).

Diver Investigation of Vanderbilt Pier (R-29) Alignment

After the sidescan survey was completed, the results were groundtruthed and a preliminary
investigation was made of the marine resources along the possible pier alignment. The results
confirmed the hardbottom edges shown on Figure 1 and in Appendix C. This operation also
confirmed the gap within the hardbottom region proposed for the seaward terminating T-section.
A description of the results follow:

are approximately 1-2' tall and are in good health. They occur roughly every 10 meters along
the proposed pier location.




The following photograph is of a massive starlet coral (Siderastrea sp.). These corals form
rounded domes along the bottom of the reef. They can grow to be 1' across.

The nearshore region in the vicinity of Vanderbilt Road access point has been monitored
periodically since 2003 as part of the Collier County Beach Renourishment Project. The results
of this investigation are summarized in Appendix G. The proposed pier location is next to FDEP
Monument R-29. Diver transects were run in 2006 at R28+550 and R29+700. The hardbottom
region in this area has between 41.4% and 79.9% average sediment coverage and between 43.3%
and 15.9% macroalgae coverage, which can be seen in the photographs above.

The DVD accompanying this report contains a five minute segment of underwater digital video
taken over the proposed Collier County pier alignment. The following indented items describe
the major elements on the video clip:

       The transect tape in the video represents the vector line where the pier would be built.
       Use this tape as a reference as the video is shot from east to west, away from shore.

       The large, yellowish structures are hard coral formations. As seen in the video, this area
       contains some of the largest corals seen in the nearshore. These corals would mostly
       likely have to be carefully transplanted away from this area prior to the start of pier
       construction.

       The round, brownish structures along the bottom are also hard corals. These too may
       have to be transplanted or mitigated for.

       The area in the video shows mostly low to moderate relief (<2 ft), with the reef
       dominated by macroalgae cover.

       Several fish species are seen in the video. Most common are snappers and sheepshead,
       both of which are favorites of fishermen.

Natural Resource Management

The nearshore hardbottom contains a number of natural resources that require special
management practices as part of the permitting and construction process. The permit application
will need to identify the means of avoiding or minimizing impacts to the hardbottom resources,
or where this is not practical, mitigate for any impacts. An environmental monitoring and
mitigation plan will be prepared as part of the permit process. Since the hardbottom area is
common to the pier and County beach nourishment projects, a joint monitoring and mitigation
program may be feasible. The county has already constructed 1.1 acres of hardbottom
mitigation, some or all of which might count towards mitigation of pier impacts.

The pier may directly impact the hardbottom habitat by causing a shadow over the habitat or by
debris caused by driving pier piles during construction. Indirectly, fishing hooks, lines, sinkers
and related debris may impact the habitat. The direct shadowing may extend to a region 1 to 4
times the pier width, which may call for mitigation up to 0.8 acre in conjunction with
construction impacts. Mitigation of 0.8 acres will cost $800,000, if not offset by the existing
reef. Relocation of corals can also mitigate for the impact, and would cost approximate
$200,000 from within the pier shadow. The Uniform Mitigation Assessment Methodology
(UMAM) calculation in conjunction consultation with permit agencies is required to determine
the actual amount of mitigation required. A detailed inventory of individual corals is proposed
as a basis for planning avoidance, minimization and mitigation of impacts. These costs are
included in Table 2.

Schedule and Cost

Design, permitting and construction of this project will take between 36 and 42 months, if there
are no major permit issues. Permitting could take up to two years based on recent experience
with complex projects. Major complex issues are often brought up late during the permitting
process. Construction will take about 2 weeks per pier pile bent, for a total time of at least 54
weeks, if the landward construction can be done simultaneously. Bid, award, and materials
acquisition will take up the remaining 18 month construction window. The four phases and
times of the project are summarized below.

Preliminary Design and Permitting Phase                                                6 months
Detailed Design Phase                                                                  6 months
Request for Additional Information (RAI) Phase                                         6-12 months
Construction Phase                                                                     18-months

Tables 2 and 3 are the construction and total project cost estimates based on the plan shown in
Sheets 1-11. These estimates are preliminary and will be modified as the design and the
environment becomes better defined. The construction cost estimate (Table 2) includes the cost
of the pier, restaurant facility with foundation street work and landscaping. The total project
cost estimate (Table 3) lists the design, permitting and engineering tasks required to implement
the project. The list breaks the project down into four phases.

There are advantages to constructing the restaurant and restroom facility separate from the pier.
The combined structure planning will have to progress at the speed of the slowest design and
permitting process, which will be the pier. The restaurant and restroom facility can be permitted
and built in a much shorter period of time. The second advantage is permitting. The pier will
require a state JCP permit and a Federal permit. The facility will need a state CCCL permit, but
no federal permit. Both will need building and zoning for the upland end of the structures. The
pier is a civil structure while the facility is largely architectural. Their will be additional cost of
separating the structures, but the speed of construction can be accelerated. The cost directly
related to the facility (restaurant and restroom) design and construction are bolded on Tables 2
and 3. Common upland costs are assigned to the facility.

We propose that a permit without the detailed calculations and design be submitted with a
request to submit the detailed design at a future date, once the site has been approved. This
should reduce detailed design expenses that may be wasted should a change in site layout be
called for.

The environmental cost will depend to a large part on the decisions made by the permit agencies.
We have tried to anticipate these based on previous experience.

Special Pier Features

A number of special features have been integrated into the feasibility level design shown in
Sheets 1-11. During the study, features from a wide variety of piers where investigated to assist
in formulating the select design. Examples of pier layouts, shade canopies, pier buildings and
restaurants are provided in Appendix G. The pier has been designed to appeal to both fishermen
and non-fisherman. Nooks protruding out from the pier have been included to serve the
fishermen, while covered pier areas are created for those who just want to observe nature. The
alternating covered and uncovered areas create areas for the public without the intrusion of
fishermen. The photograph of Juno Pier from Florida's east coast illustrates some of these
features.

Conclusions

The construction of a pier at the Vanderbilt Beach access point is feasible, based on the
preliminary investigation conducted for this study. Permitting of a long pier will depend on
developing a monitoring and mitigation program acceptable to the permit agencies. The pier
design and permitting should begin with an effort to seek site approval before moving to a
detailed design phase.

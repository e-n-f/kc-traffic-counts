PREFACE

The Milpitas Midtown Area encompasses approximately 1,000 acres of land at the core of the City.
In March 1999, the City of Milpitas initiated the planning process for the Midtown Area and
developed the Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan (Specific Plan). The Specific Plan created new
General Plan land use and zoning designations that allowed higher density development in the
Midtown Area, and circulation and utility improvements to support the development. The
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) prepared for the Specific Plan identified that the Specific Plan
would result in significant unavoidable transportation and air quality impacts. On March 19, 2002,
the City of Milpitas certified the EIR prepared for the Specific Plan.

This Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (SEIR) has been prepared by the City of Milpitas in
conformance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the CEQA Guidelines.
The SEIR describes the changes to the Specific Plan that are being proposed (see below), as well as
the impacts that will result from those changes. The purpose of this SEIR is to inform decision
makers and the general public of the environmental effects of the proposed project. Section 15163 of
the CEQA Guidelines states that the lead or responsible agency may prepare a supplement to a
previously-certified EIR if only minor additions or changes are necessary to make the previous EIR
adequate. Further, the supplement to the EIR need contain only the information necessary to make
the previous EIR adequate.

This SEIR provides project-level environmental review appropriate for the proposed Milpitas
Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update project, in accordance with Sections 15163 of the
CEQA Guidelines.

City of Milpitas                             1                                             June 2008
SUMMARY

                                 Summary Description of the Proposed Project

The proposed project consists of changes to the existing and planned roadway system within the
Milpitas Midtown Area, which were described in the Specific Plan EIR as either the existing
condition or as proposed mitigation for impacts created by the Specific Plan. These changes include
the following:

1) Converting the eastbound Carlo Street onramp at Calaveras Boulevard to an eastbound offramp.

 2) Reducing the number of lanes on Main Street from Abel Street to Great Mall Parkway from five
lanes (two lanes in each direction with a center turn lane) to three lanes (one lane in each direction
with a center turn lane).

3) Removing the existing dedicated southbound right turn lane at the intersection of Main Street and
Abel Street.

4) Eliminating the future construction of a second left turn lane from eastbound Calaveras Boulevard
to northbound Abel Street.

5) Modifying the signal phasing at the intersection of Calaveras Boulevard and Abel Street to allow
simultaneous southbound right turn and eastbound left turn movements.

                                Summary of Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Transportation

                                                         Impact

IMPACT TR-1:            The diverted traffic resulting from closing the Carlo Street offramp would
degrade operations at the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard from LOS E to LOS F
during the PM peak hour. [Significant Impact]

                                                       Mitigation

MM TR-1:            The 2030 Valley Transportation Plan (VTP) includes the widening of Calaveras
                    Boulevard, between Milpitas Boulevard and I-880. Although this is a high priority
                    project, no current funding for this project has been secured. The following measures
                    would return operation of this intersection to LOS to E during the PM peak hour and
                    would need to be implemented as part of the Calaveras widening project:

                    ·        Add one additional westbound left turn lane on Calaveras Boulevard (for a
                             total of 2 left turn lanes), and
                    ·        Restripe the northbound approach on Abel Street from a two through lanes
                             and one right turn lane to one through lane, one shared right/through lane, and
                             one right turn lane. 1

    This may require modifications to the crosswalks at the intersection.

MMSP Transportation Update                                                                        Draft SEIR
City of Milpitas                                        2                                          June 2008
                                             Conclusion

Although the above-mitigation would return the LOS to E during the PM peak hour, the addition of a
second northbound right turn lane on Abel Street would result in safety issues for pedestrians in the
adjacent crosswalk. While removal of the crosswalk would eliminate the safety issue, crosswalk
removal would decrease pedestrian mobility in the Midtown area, which is not consistent with the
goals of the Midtown Specific Plan. In addition, the second westbound left turn lane on Calaveras
Boulevard may result in alignment issues and/or additional right-of-way on the north side of
Calaveras Boulevard and widening the Wrigley Creek box culvert. Widening the Wrigley Creek box
culvert would result in water quality and riparian habitat impacts. Furthermore, this improvement
would likely require widening the Calaveras Boulevard bridge between Abel Street and Milpitas
Boulevard, which may not occur for many years due to lack of full funding. For these reasons, this
mitigation is not considered feasible and is not proposed by the project. Because the intersection of
Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard is designated a CMP intersection, the City of Milpitas will
prepare a deficiency plan, as required by the CMA for significant impacts to CMP intersections. The
proposed project would not result in any other transportation impacts.

The EIR prepared for the Specific Plan disclosed that implementation of the Specific Plan would
result in significant and unavoidable impacts at eight intersections. The transportation impact that
would result from the proposed project is not one of these previously identified significant and
unavoidable impacts. For this reason, transportation impact that would result from the proposed
project is greater than the transportation impact disclosed in the certified EIR prepared for the
Specific Plan. [Significant Unavoidable Impact]

                                      Summary of Alternatives

CEQA requires that an EIR identify alternatives to the project as proposed. The CEQA Guidelines
[Section 15126.6(a)] specify that an EIR identify alternatives which "would feasibly attain most of
the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant
effects of the project." SECTION 5 ALTERNATIVES of this EIR analyzes several alternatives to
the proposed project. A brief summary of these alternatives and their impacts is provided below.

No Project Alternative

Under the No Project alternative, none of the components of the proposed project would be
implemented and all of the environmental impacts of the proposed project would be avoided. The
No Project alternative would meet none of the project objectives. The No Project alternative is an
environmentally superior alternative to the proposed project.

No Carlo Street Ramp Conversion Alternative

The No Carlo Street Ramp Conversion alternative includes implementing all of the components of
the proposed project, except for converting the Carlo Street onramp to an offramp. The No Carlo
Street Ramp Conversion alternative would avoid the significant unavoidable transportation impact
and the short-term, construction-related air quality and noise impacts that result from the proposed
project. The No Carlo Street Ramp Conversion alternative would meet all of the project objectives,
except for avoiding the existing unsafe condition created by the existing Carlo Street onramp. The
No Carlo Street Ramp Conversion alternative is an environmentally superior alternative to the
proposed project.

Reconstruct Carlo Street Onramp Alternative

The Reconstruct Carlo Street Onramp alternative would reconstruct the offramp in a manner that
would address the current safety issues associated with the short merge distance. The Reconstruct
Carlo Street Onramp alternative would avoid the significant transportation impact resulting from the
proposed project and would meet all of the objectives of the proposed project, except for improving
vehicular access to the Midtown Area. The Reconstruct Carlo Street Onramp alternative is not
feasible, because there is presently no evidence to conclude that it could be constructed within a
reasonable period of time.

Onramp and Offramp Alternative

In addition to all the components of the Reconstruct Onramp alternative (see above), the Onramp and
Offramp alternative includes construction of a Carlo Street offramp. The Onramp and Offramp
alternative would achieve all the objectives and would avoid all the impacts of the proposed project.
The Onramp and Offramp alternative is not feasible, because there is presently no evidence to
conclude that it could be constructed within a reasonable period of time.

SECTION 1              INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND, AND PROJECT
                       OBJECTIVES

1.1    PROJECT LOCATION

The Milpitas Midtown Area is comprised of approximately 1,000 acres of land at the core of the
City. The area is generally bounded by the Union Pacific Railroad lines on the east; Trade Zone
Boulevard on the south; Main Street, Highway 880, Abel Street on the west; and Abel Street on the
north (refer to Figures 1 and 2).

1.2    BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE PROJECT

The EIR for the Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan (Specific Plan) was certified on March 19, 2002.
The Specific Plan itself was approved by the Milpitas City Council in April 2002. Work on several
projects included in the Specific Plan has been completed or is in progress, while work on other
projects included in the Specific Plan has not yet started.

This SEIR is being prepared to address proposed changes to the existing and planned roadway
system within the Milpitas Midtown Area, which were described in the Specific Plan EIR as either
the existing condition or proposed as mitigation for impacts created by the Specific Plan.

1.3    PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The City's stated objectives for the proposed project are as follows:

1.     Remediate the existing condition of unsafe merging of cars onto eastbound Calaveras
       Boulevard from Carlo Street.
2.     Safely accommodate bike lanes and parking on the west side of Main Street from Abel Street
       to Great Mall Parkway
3.     Avoid the acquisition of right-of-way on the north side of Calaveras Boulevard and widening
       the Wrigley Creek box culvert.
4.     Avoid water quality and riparian habitat impacts that could result from widening the Wrigley
       Creek box culvert.
5.     Improve the efficiency of traffic operations at the intersection of Calaveras Boulevard and
       Abel Street.
6.     Improve vehicular access to the Milpitas Midtown Area.
7.     Improve pedestrian circulation in the Milpitas Midtown Area.

1.4    USES OF THE EIR

This SEIR provides environmental review for the proposed Milpitas Midtown Transportation Update
project. The information contained in this EIR will be used by the City of Milpitas (the CEQA Lead
Agency) as it considers whether or not to approve some or all of the changes to the existing and
planned roadway system within the Milpitas Midtown Area that are proposed by the project. Per
Section 15163 of the CEQA Guidelines, when the City decides whether to approve the project, the
City shall consider the previous EIR as revised by this SEIR.

SECTION 2              DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT

2.1            DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project proposes the following changes to the existing and planned roadway system within the
Milpitas Midtown Area: 1) converting the existing eastbound Carlo Street onramp at Calaveras
Boulevard to an eastbound offramp, 2) reducing the existing number of lanes on Main Street from
Abel Street to Great Mall Parkway from five lanes (two lanes in each direction with a center turn
lane) to three lanes (one lane in each direction with a center turn lane), 3) removing the existing
dedicated southbound right turn lane at the intersection of Main Street and Abel Street, 4) eliminating
the future construction of a second left turn lane from eastbound Calaveras Boulevard to northbound
Abel Street, and 5) modifying the signal phasing at the intersection of Calaveras Boulevard and Abel
Street to allow simultaneous southbound right turn and eastbound left turn movements. These
proposed changes are discussed in further detail below.

2.1.1          Carlo Street Onramp/Offramp Conversion

Carlo Street west of Main Street is an approximately 500-foot, two-way street that provides an
onramp to eastbound Calaveras Boulevard, secondary driveway access to the commercial property
located on the north side of the Carlo Street, and primary driveway access to the commercial property
located on the south side of Carlo Street. The existing onramp is elevated on fill approximately five
feet to meet the elevation of Calaveras Boulevard.

The project proposes to convert the eastbound onramp to an eastbound offramp and the 500-foot
section of Carlo Street west of Main Street to a one-way street. The locations of the existing
driveways would remain essentially unchanged. The conceptual plan for the Carlo Street onramp to
offramp Conversion is shown on Figure 3.

2.1.2          Main Street Modifications

Main Street from Abel Street to Great Mall Parkway includes two lanes in each direction, a shared
center turn lane, and a bike lane on each side of the street. There is no onstreet parking allowed on
this segment of Main Street.

The project proposes to reduce the number of lanes on Main Street from Abel Street to Great Mall
Parkway from five lanes (two lanes in each direction with a center turn lane) to three lanes (one lane
in each direction with a center turn lane). The right-of-way gained from removing one lane in each
direction would be used to increase the width of the existing bike lanes and to allow parking on the
west side of the street. In order to insure that the lane reduction on Main Street does not interfere
with intersection operations at Great Mall Parkway/Main Street and Abel Street/Main Street, existing
lane configurations at the intersections would remain unchanged, except for the removal of the right
turn lane, as described below.

The existing southbound approach to the Main and Abel Street intersection (i.e., Main Street or the
east leg of the intersection) includes a dedicated right turn lane and two left turn lanes. The project
proposes to remove the dedicated southbound right turn lane at the intersection and re-stripe the Main
Street leg of the intersection with two lanes.

2.1.3          Calaveras Boulevard/Abel Street Intersection Modifications

The project proposes to eliminate the future construction of a second left turn lane from eastbound
Calaveras Boulevard to northbound Abel Street and modify the signal phasing at this intersection to
allow simultaneous southbound right turns and eastbound left turns. Under existing conditions, the
southbound traffic has a red light when the eastbound left turn movement has a green arrow. The
proposed phasing would include a southbound green right turn arrow simultaneously with the
eastbound green left turn arrow. The proposed phasing would prohibit eastbound u-turns.

SECTION 3              CONSISTENCY WITH ADOPTED PLANS AND
                       POLICIES

This section complies with CEQA Guidelines Section 15125 (d), which requires that an EIR discuss
any inconsistencies between the proposed project and applicable general plans and regional plans.

3.1            CITY OF MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN

The City of Milpitas General Plan is a comprehensive, long-term plan that represents the City's
official development policy. The General Plan contains several goals and policies pertaining to the
City's circulation system. These policies support public transit, non-vehicular modes of travel, and a
safe, convenient, and efficient circulation system. The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan
Transportation Update does not conflict with these policies. The proposed project would improve
pedestrian and bicycle facilities by providing contiguous sidewalks on both sides of Carlo Street,
obtaining right-of-way on Main Street from Abel Street to Great Mall Parkway to safely
accommodate bike lanes on both sides of the street and parking on the west side of the street, and
reducing the crosswalk length at the existing southbound approach to the Main and Abel Street
intersection. The proposed project supports a safe and efficient circulation system by avoiding
merging of cars onto eastbound Calaveras Boulevard from Carlo Street, improving bike access along
Main Street, and improving the efficiency of the southbound right turn movement at the intersection
of Calaveras Boulevard and Abel Street.

3.2            CONGESTION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

In 1991, legislation was passed creating requirements for congestion management in urbanized areas
of California. The legislation spawned the creation of Congestion Management Agencies (CMA).
The Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) is the CMA for Santa Clara County and has developed
the Congestion Management Program (CMP). The CMP designates regionally significant
intersections throughout the County. CMA law requires that local agencies either maintain levels of
service at designated regionally significant intersections, or prepare deficiency plans that identify
improvement strategies. The VTA has developed standards and procedures for the preparation of
deficiency plans. Deficiency plans can be prepared at the time a deficiency occurs, or they can be
prepared in advance based on long range forecasts. The proposed project will result in a significant
unavoidable impact at a CMP intersection (i.e., Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard). In
conformance with CMA law, the City will prepare a deficiency plan meeting the standards and
procedures of the CMA. For this reason, the proposed project is consistent with the CMP.

SECTION 4               ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING, IMPACTS, AND
                        MITIGATION

4.1             AESTHETICS

4.11            Discussion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would modify signal phasing, re-stripe
streets, forgo planned mitigation, and convert an existing onramp to an offramp. These
inconspicuous changes would not change the visual character of the Midtown Area or block scenic
views. The project would not create a new source of light or glare and would not be visible from a
designated state scenic highway. For these reasons, the proposed project would not have an
aesthetics impact.

4.12            Conclusion

The aesthetic impact that could result from the Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation
Update is less than that disclosed in the certified EIR prepared for the Specific Plan.


4.2             AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

4.21            Discussion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would affect existing roadways within
existing right-of-way that are designated Urban and Built-up Land by the California Resources
Agency. For these reasons, Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not affect
agricultural resources.

4.22            Conclusion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would have no impact upon agricultural
resources.

4.3             AIR QUALITY

4.31            Discussion

Dust generation during construction of the Carlo Street onramp to offramp conversion could result in
short-term air quality impacts. These would be reduced to a less than significant level with the
implementation of standard dust control measures (e.g., apply water to exposed soil).

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would increase congestion at the
intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard, which would increase carbon monoxide (CO)
concentrations at this intersection. However, as stated in the certified EIR prepared for the Specific
Plan, the project area is in compliance with federal and state CO standards and vehicular CO
emission is decreasing due to more stringent standards. For these reasons, the Milpitas Midtown
Specific Plan Transportation Update would not result in significant localized air quality impacts.



MMSP Transportation Update                                                                    Draft SEIR
City of Milpitas                              12                                               June 2008
4.32           Conclusion

The air quality impacts that could result from the Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation
Update are the same or less than those disclosed in the certified EIR prepared for the Specific Plan.

4.4             BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

4.41           Discussion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not affect biological resources,
except for small landscape trees and shrubs located in the existing Carlo Street onramp right-of-way,
some or all of which would be removed by the project. These trees and shrubs do not constitute
important biological habitat. As discussed in the certified EIR prepared for the Specific Plan, the
removal of landscaping (i.e., small trees and shrubs) would not significantly impact biological
resources.

4.42           Conclusion

Impacts to biological resources that could result from the Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan
Transportation Update are the same or less than those disclosed in the certified EIR prepared for the
Specific Plan.

4.5            CULTURAL RESOURCES

4.51           Discussion

The existing Carlo Street onramp is constructed on imported fill. Therefore, construction of the
Carlo Street onramp to offramp conversion would not disturb native soils and would not impact
cultural resources. The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update does not propose any
other ground disturbing activities. Therefore, the proposed project would not impact cultural
resources.

4.52           Conclusion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not impact cultural resources.

4.6            ENERGY

4.6.1          Discussion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update is a roadway project that includes signal
phasing modification, lane re-striping, forgoing planned traffic mitigation, and converting an existing
onramp to an offramp. Upon completion, the project would not use or increase the use of energy.
Construction of the Carlo Street onramp to offramp conversion would require the use of energy. The
short-term use of energy during construction is not substantial.

4.6.2          Conclusion

The energy impact of the Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update is less than those
disclosed in the certified EIR prepared for the Specific Plan.

MMSP Transportation Update                                                                   Draft SEIR

4.7             GEOLOGY AND SOILS

4.7.1           Discussion

Except for the conversion of the Carlo Street onramp to an offramp, the Milpitas Midtown Specific
Plan Update does not propose any new development. The Carlo Street onramp to offramp
conversion would be completed with the implementation of existing building permit standards that
ensure geology and soil impacts do not occur. The other roadway changes proposed by the project
(i.e., modifying signal phasing, re-striping streets, and forgoing planned mitigation) would not have
geology or soils impacts because they would not expose people or structures to geology and soil
hazards.

4.7.2           Conclusion

Geology and soil impacts that could result from the Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation
Update are the same or less than those disclosed in the certified EIR prepared for the Specific Plan.

4.8             HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

4.8.1           Discussion

Except for the conversion of the Carlo Street onramp to an offramp, the Milpitas Midtown Specific
Plan Update does not propose any new development. The existing Carlo Street onramp is
constructed atop imported fill that is not contaminated with hazardous materials (e.g., agricultural
pesticides). The existing onramp structure is cement and does not contain hazardous materials. For
these reasons, conversion of the Carlo Street onramp to an offramp would not expose people or the
environment to hazards or hazardous materials. The other roadway changes proposed by the project
(i.e., modifying signal phasing, re-striping streets, and forgoing planned mitigation) would not have
hazards and hazardous material impacts because they would not expose people or structures to
hazards or hazardous materials.

4.8.2           Conclusion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Update would not result in hazards and hazardous material
impacts.

4.9             HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

4.9.1           Discussion

Except for the conversion of the Carlo Street onramp to an offramp, the Milpitas Midtown Specific
Plan Update does not propose any new development. As shown in the certified EIR prepared for the
Specific Plan, the Carlo Street onramp to offramp conversion is not located within a 100-year flood
zone. The construction of the Carlo Street onramp to offramp conversion would, however, expose
soil to the erosive forces of water and wind, which could result in water quality impacts downstream
of the project site (e.g., sedimentation). Erosion control measures will be implemented during
construction (e.g., fiber rolls). Once construction is complete and all disturbed soil is stabilized with
landscaping, erosion will be minimal. The other roadway changes proposed by the project (i.e.,
modifying signal phasing, re-striping streets, and forgoing planned mitigation) would not have

hydrology and water quality impacts because they would not change the existing hydrology of the
project area or contaminate surface or groundwater in the project area.

4.9.2          Conclusion

Hydrology and water quality impacts that could result from the Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan
Transportation Update are the same or less than those disclosed in the certified EIR prepared for the
Specific Plan.

4.10           LAND USE

4.10.1         Discussion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Update would only affect existing roadway facilities within
existing right-of-way. The project does not propose any land use or zoning designation changes and
does not conflict with any plans or policies adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an
environmental effect. The project area is not within the boundaries of a habitat conservation plan or
a natural community conservation plan. For these reasons, the Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan
Update would not result in land use impacts.

4.10.2         Conclusion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not result in land use impacts.

4.11           MINERAL RESOURCES

4.11.1         Discussion

The Milpitas Midtown Area does not contain any known important mineral resources, as delineated
by the California Division of Mines and Geology or the Milpitas General Plan. The Milpitas
Midtown Specific Plan Update would only affect existing facilities in existing right-of-way. For
these reasons, the proposed project would not impact mineral resources.

4.11.2          Conclusion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not impact known mineral
resources.

4.12           NOISE

4.12.1         Discussion

Except during the construction of the Carlo Street onramp to offramp conversion, the Milpitas
Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not generate noise. Construction of the Carlo
Street onramp to offramp conversion would generate noise. The nearest noise sensitive land uses
(e.g., residences) are located across Calaveras Boulevard approximately 150 feet west of the existing
Carlo Street onramp on Spence Avenue. While construction noise will be audible at these
residences, the impacts will not be significant because the duration will be temporary and
construction will be limited to the daytime hours. Therefore, noise generated during construction of
the onramp to offramp conversion is not expected to substantially affect sensitive land uses. The

MMSP Transportation Update                                                                  Draft SEIR

other roadway changes proposed by the project (i.e., modifying signal phasing, re-striping streets,
and forgoing planned mitigation) would not increase noise levels during or after construction.

4.12.2          Conclusion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not result in significant noise
impacts.

4.13           POPULATION AND HOUSING

4.13.1         Discussion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not construct or displace housing
or induce substantial population growth directly or indirectly.

4.13.2         Conclusion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not result in population and
housing impacts.

4.14           PUBLIC SERVICES

4.14.1         Discussion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would only affect existing roadway
facilities within existing right-of-way. The proposed changes to the roadway system would not affect
existing or planned fire protection or police protection facilities or schools, parks or libraries.

4.14.2         Conclusion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not impact public services.

4.15           RECREATION

4.15.1         Discussion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update is a roadway project that includes signal
phasing modification, lane re-striping, forgoing planned traffic mitigation, and converting an existing
onramp to an offramp. The project would only affect the existing roadway system in the existing
right-of-way. The changes to the existing and planned roadway system proposed by the project
would not affect recreation facilities.

4.15.2         Conclusion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not impact recreation facilities.

4.16            TRANSPORTATION

The following discussion is based upon the transportation impact analysis (TIA) prepared for the
proposed project by Hexagon Associates in February 2008. The TIA is included as Appendix B to
this SEIR.

4.16.1          Regulatory Setting

4.16.1.1        Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority

The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) is the Congestion Management Agency
(CMA) for Santa Clara County and oversees the Santa Clara County Congestion Management
Program (CMP). The CMP identifies regional intersections in the county that are under the control
of the CMA. The CMA's traffic level of service standard for CMP intersections in the county is
Level of Service E.

4.16.1.2        City of Milpitas Level of Service Policies

The City of Milpitas General Plan states that the level of service goal for the local roadway system is
Level of Service D, and Level of Service E for regional CMP intersections.

4.16.2          Existing Setting

Regional access to the Midtown area is provided via I-880, I-680, and SR 237/Calaveras Boulevard.
These facilities are described below.

         I-680 is a north/south freeway traversing the eastern portion of Milpitas. This freeway
         connects the inland East Bay communities to the north with San Jose to the south. I-680 has
         six mixed flow lanes north of SR 237 and eight mixed flow lanes south of SR 237. A
         southbound HOV lane is currently in operation north of Calaveras Boulevard.

         I-880 is a north/south freeway providing regional access from East Bay cities to San Jose,
         where it becomes SR 17. Within the City of Milpitas, I-880 is a six-to-eight lane freeway.
         The initial construction phases of the SR 237/I-880 interchange have recently been
         completed. South of Montague Expressway, I-880 has recently been widened to six lanes.

         State Route 237/Calaveras Boulevard is an east/west arterial between I-880 and I-680 and
         generally provides six travel lanes (four on the Union Pacific overcrossing). West of I-880,
         this facility becomes a freeway with four mixed flow lanes and two High Occupancy Vehicle
         (HOV) lanes. Calaveras Boulevard accommodates a significant amount of regional through
         traffic during the peak commute hours. Milpitas staff estimate that approximately 50 percent
         of the peak hour traffic between I-680 and I-880 is generated outside of Milpitas. The
         predominant direction of travel is westbound in the morning and eastbound during the
         afternoon.

City of Milpitas                              17                                              June 2008
Local access to the Midtown area is provided by Abel Street and Main Street. These roadways are
described below.

       Abel Street is a four-lane north/south arterial beginning at Main Street and terminating at
       Milpitas Boulevard. This roadway provides a two-way center left turn lane along some
       segments and is signalized at major cross streets. On-street parking is generally prohibited,
       except adjacent to residential frontage.

       Main Street is a north/south collector connecting Montague Expressway to residential areas
       north of Calaveras Boulevard. This roadway consists of four travel lanes from Montague
       Expressway to immediately north of Curtis Avenue, where it transitions to a two lane facility
       with parking on both sides. Main Street currently operates within capacity, but experiences
       peak hour congestion at its intersection with Montague Expressway.

The following existing intersections were studied because they are located in the project area and,
therefore, could be affected by the Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update:

       ·       I-880 Southbound Ramps and Calaveras Boulevard
       ·       I-880 Northbound Ramps and Calaveras Boulevard
       ·       Abbott Street and Calaveras Boulevard
       ·       Serra Way and Calaveras Boulevard
       ·       Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard*
       ·       Milpitas Boulevard and Calaveras Boulevard*
       ·       Town Center Drive and Calaveras Boulevard
       ·       Hillview Drive and Calaveras Boulevard
       ·       Abel Street and Marylinn Drive
       ·       Abel Street and Weller Lane
       ·       Abel Street and Serra Avenue
       ·       Abel Street and Corning Avenue
       ·       Abel Street and Main Street
       ·       Main Street and Weller Lane (unsignalized)
       ·       Main Street and Calaveras Boulevard Offramp (unsignalized)
       ·       Main Street and Carlo Street (unsignalized)
       ·       Main Street and Serra Way
       ·       Main Street and Great Mall Parkway

4.16.2.2       Existing Level of Service

The existing traffic conditions at the above-listed study intersections were analyzed for the weekday
AM and PM peak hours of traffic. The AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00
AM, and the PM peak hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the
most congested traffic conditions occur on an average day. Traffic conditions at the study
intersections were evaluated using Level of Service (LOS). As shown in Tables 1 and 2, LOS is a
qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with
little or no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays.



MMSP Transportation Update                                                                  Draft SEIR

The existing LOS at the study intersections was calculated using TRAFFIX software with CMP
default settings. TRAFFIX is based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method for
intersections, and evaluates intersection operations on the basis of average delay for all vehicles at
the intersection. This average delay can then be correlated to an LOS, as shown in Table 1 for
signalized intersections and Table 2 for unsignalized intersections. For two-way stop controlled
intersections, the reported LOS is for the worst approach of the intersection.

"Near Term No Project" peak hour traffic volumes were calculated by adding to existing volumes the
estimated traffic from approved-but-not-yet-constructed developments and traffic from the Milpitas
Midtown Specific Plan. The traffic from approved-but-not-yet-constructed developments includes
the trips from the City's Approved Trips Inventory (ATI) and trips from buildout of Phase I of the
nearby North San Jose Area Development Policy. In cases where Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan
development traffic was also included in the ATI or has been built, the duplicate trips were removed
from the Near Term No Project traffic volume estimates.

The Near-term LOS analysis assumes the mitigation identified in the Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan
EIR as well as programmed Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) are implemented at the study
intersections, including the following:

         ·      An additional eastbound left turn at the Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard intersection
                (Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan EIR mitigation), and
         ·      Median improvements on Main Street and Abel Street (CIP Projects).

The results of the intersection level of service analysis under "Near Term No Project" conditions are
summarized in Table 3. The results show that the intersection of Milpitas Boulevard/Calaveras
Boulevard would operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour. The remaining study intersections
would operate at an acceptable LOS.

4.16.2          Transportation Impacts

4.16.2.1        Thresholds of Significance

For the purposes of this EIR, a transportation impact is considered significant if the project would:

·        cause the level of service at any City of Milpitas intersection operating at LOS D or better
         under Background Conditions to deteriorate to LOS E or F,
·        cause an increase in the critical movement delay at any City of Milpitas intersection
         operating at LOS E or F under Background Conditions of four (4) or more seconds and an
         increase in the critical V/C ratio by 0.01 or more,
·        cause an increase in the V/C ratio of 0.01 or more at an intersection with unacceptable
         operations (LOS E or F) when the change in critical delay is negative (i.e., decreases). This
         can occur if the critical movements change,
·        cause the level of service at a regional CMP intersection operating at LOS E or better under
         Background Conditions to deteriorate to LOS F,
·        cause an increase in the critical movement delay at any regional CMP intersection operating
         at LOS F under Background Conditions of four (4) or more seconds and an increase in the
         critical V/C ratio by 0.01 or more,
·        cause a freeway segment to operate at LOS F, or contribute traffic in excess of one percent
         (1%) of segment capacity to a freeway segment already operating at LOS F,
·        substantially increase hazards due to a design feature (e.g., dangerous intersection) or
         incompatible uses,
·        result in inadequate emergency access,
·        result in inadequate parking capacity, or
·        conflict with adopted plans or policies supporting alternative transportation.

4.16.3.2               Project Traffic Operations

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update proposes the following changes to the
existing and planned roadway system within the Milpitas Midtown Area:

       ·       Convert the eastbound Carlo Street onramp at Calaveras Boulevard to an eastbound
               offramp,
       ·       Reduce Main Street between Abel Street and Great Mall Parkway from five lanes
               (two lanes in each direction with a center turn lane) to three lanes (one in each
               direction with a center turn lane),
       ·       remove the dedicated southbound right turn lane at the intersection of Main and Abel
               Street and re-stripe this leg of the intersection with two lanes.
       ·       Eliminate future construction of a second left turn lane from eastbound Calaveras
               Boulevard to northbound Abel Street, and
       ·       Modify signal phasing at the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard to
               allow simultaneous southbound right turn and eastbound left turn movements.

Other than these changes, the traffic analysis assumed that the near-term roadway network under
project conditions would be the same as described under Near Term No Project conditions.

Converting the Carlo Street onramp to an offramp was evaluated in two phases. Phase I is the
closure of the existing onramp. Phase II is the opening of the new offramp. Phase I and Phase II
were evaluated in combination with the other improvements proposed by the project and described
above (i.e., lane reduction on Main Street, elimination of second left turn at Calaveras/Abel, and
signal phasing improvements at Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard). The traffic impact analysis
determined that these other improvements would not substantially affect AM or PM intersection
operations in the project area. The following discussion, therefore, focuses on the closure of the
onramp (Phase I) and opening of the offramp (Phase II).

                                   Carlo Street Onramp Closure

Converting the existing Carlo Street onramp to an offramp would change travel routes for drivers
entering and exiting Midtown Area. With the onramp closed, drivers exiting the Midtown Area
would have two options for reaching eastern destinations. These options would depend on the origin
of the traffic (i.e., south or north of Calaveras Boulevard). Traffic originating south of Calaveras
Boulevard would likely divert to northbound Abel Street (via Serra Way, Corning Avenue, or other
parallel route) and make a right turn at the intersection of Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard. Traffic
originating north of Calaveras Boulevard on Main Street would likely divert to southbound Abel
Street (via Weller Lane) and turn left at the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard. The
onramp closure would substantially increase the number of vehicles passing through the intersection
of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard, which would degrade PM peak hour operations at this
intersection from LOS E in the Near Term to LOS F. The ramp closure would not substantially
affect the other study intersections during the PM peak hour. Closing the onramp would not impact
any of the study intersections during the AM peak hour. The results of the LOS analysis under Phase
I are summarized in Table 4.

Impact TR-1: Closing the Carlo Street offramp would divert traffic to the intersection of Abel Street
and Calaveras Boulevard, which would degrade PM peak hour operations at this intersection from
LOS E to LOS F. [Significant Impact]

      City of Milpitas                              23                                            June 2008
                                           Carlo Street Offramp Opening

Similar to the closing the Carlo Street onramp diverting traffic, opening the Carlo Street onramp
would provide a direct route for vehicles entering the Midtown Area and would also divert traffic in
the Midtown Area. Currently, most vehicles traveling eastbound on Calaveras Boulevard enter the
Midtown Area by either turn right onto Serra Way or left onto Abel Street. The Carlo Street offramp
would result in more vehicles traveling through the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras
Boulevard to use the offramp and fewer vehicles using Serra Way or making a left onto Abel Street.
Although the proposed Carlo Street offramp would increase the amount of vehicles traveling through
the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard, the offramp would not substantially affect
this intersection or the other study intersections during the AM or PM peak hour. The results of the
LOS analysis for the opening of the offramp are summarized in Table 4.

       Freeways, Parking, Alternative Transportation, and Pedestrian and Emergency Access

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not increase the amount of
vehicles on adjacent freeways (i.e., Interstate 880 and 680), restrict the use of alternative forms of
transportation, impede pedestrian or emergency vehicle access, or increase hazards due to a design
feature. The proposed roadway changes would remove the currently unsafe Carlo Street onramp,
provide additional sidewalks on Carlo Street, reduce crosswalk length at the intersection of Main and
Abel Street, and provide right-of-way for onstreet parking on Main Street between Abel Street and
Great Mall Parkway. For these reasons, the Milpitas Midtown Transportation Update would not
result in impacts to freeways, alternative forms of transportation, or restrict pedestrian or emergency
access.

4.16.4              Mitigation

MM TR-1:            The 2030 Valley Transportation Plan (VTP) includes the widening of Calaveras
                    Boulevard, between Milpitas Boulevard and I-880. Although this is a high priority
                    project, no current funding for this project has been secured. The following measures
                    would return operation of this intersection to LOS to E during the PM peak hour and
                    would need to be implemented as part of the Calaveras widening project:

                    ·         Add one additional westbound left turn lane on Calaveras Boulevard (for a
                              total of 2 left turn lanes), and
                    ·         Restripe the northbound approach on Abel Street from two through lanes and
                              one right turn lane to one through lane, one shared right/through lane, and one
                              right turn lane. 2

4.16.5              Conclusion

Although the above-mitigation would return the LOS to E during the PM peak hour, the addition of a
second northbound right turn lane on Abel Street would result in safety issues for pedestrians in the
adjacent crosswalk. While removal of the crosswalk would eliminate the safety issue, crosswalk
removal would decrease pedestrian mobility in the Midtown area, which is not consistent with the
goals of the Midtown Specific Plan. In addition, the second westbound left turn lane on Calaveras
Boulevard may result in alignment issues and/or additional right-of-way on the north side of
Calaveras Boulevard and widening the Wrigley Creek box culvert. Widening the Wrigley Creek box

    This may require modifications to the crosswalk at this leg of the intersection.

culvert would result in water quality and riparian habitat impacts. Furthermore, this improvement
would likely require widening the Calaveras Boulevard bridge between Abel Street and Milpitas
Boulevard, which may not occur for many years due to lack of full funding. For these reasons, this
mitigation is not considered feasible and is not proposed by the project. Because the intersection of
Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard is designated a CMP intersection, the City of Milpitas will
prepare a deficiency plan, as required by the CMA for significant impacts to CMP intersections. The
proposed project would not result in any other transportation impacts.

The EIR prepared for the Specific Plan disclosed that implementation of the Specific Plan would
result in significant and unavoidable impacts at eight intersections. The transportation impact that
would result from the proposed project is not one of these previously identified significant and
unavoidable impacts. For this reason, transportation impact that would result from the proposed
project is greater than the transportation impact disclosed in the certified EIR prepared for the
Specific Plan. [Significant Unavoidable Impact]

4.17           UTILITIES AND SERVICE SYSTEMS

4.17.1         Discussion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update is a roadway project that includes signal
phasing modification, lane re-striping, forgoing planned traffic mitigation, and converting an existing
onramp to an offramp. The project would only affect the existing roadway system in the existing
right-of-way. No utility lines are located with the right-of-way of the proposed Carlo Street onramp
to offramp conversion. The changes to the existing and planned roadway system proposed by the
project would not affect utility and service systems.

4.17.2         Conclusion

The Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not impact utility and service
systems.

SECTION 5               ALTERNATIVES

5.1             INTRODUCTION

Section 15126.6 of the CEQA Guidelines provides extensive direction on identifying and evaluating
alternatives to a proposed project, specifically:

(a) ...An EIR shall describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or to the location of the
project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or
substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project...An EIR need not consider every
conceivable alternative to a project...An EIR is not required to consider alternatives which are
infeasible...There is no ironclad rule governing the nature or scope of the alternatives to be discussed
other than the rule of reason.

(b) ... the discussion of alternatives shall focus on alternatives to the project or its location which are
capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project, even if these
alternatives would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives, or would be more
costly.
(d) ...The EIR shall include sufficient information about each alternative to allow meaningful
evaluation, analysis, and comparison with the proposed project...

Given the information above, the three critical factors to consider when selecting and evaluating
alternatives are: 1.) the significant impacts from the proposed project that could be reduced or
avoided by an alternative, 2.) the project's objectives, and 3.) the feasibility of the alternatives
available. Each of these factors is discussed below.

5.1.1           Significant Impacts

As discussed in Section 4.16 TRANSPORTATION of this SEIR, the proposed project would result
in the following significant unavoidable impact:

Impact TR-1: The diverted traffic resulting from closing the Carlo Street offramp would degrade
operations at the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard during the PM peak hour from
LOS E to LOS F. [Significant Unavoidable Impact]

5.1.2           Objectives

While CEQA does not require that alternatives must be capable of meeting all of the project
objectives, their ability to meet most of the objectives is considered relevant to their consideration:

The objectives for the proposed project are as follows:

1.      Avoid the existing condition of unsafe merging of cars onto eastbound Calaveras Boulevard
        from Carlo Street.
2.      Obtain additional right-of-way on Main Street from Abel Street to Great Mall Parkway to
        safely accommodate bike lanes on both sides of the street and parking on the west side of the
        street.
3.      Avoid the acquisition of right-of-way on the north side of Calaveras Boulevard and widening
        the Wrigley Creek box culvert.


MMSP Transportation Update                                                                       Draft SEIR
City of Milpitas                                26                                                June 2008
4.      Avoid water quality and riparian habitat impacts that could result from widening the Wrigley
        Creek box culvert.
5.      Improve the efficiency of traffic operations at the intersection of Calaveras Boulevard and
        Abel Street.
6.      Improve vehicular access to the Milpitas Midtown Area.
7.      Improve pedestrian circulation in the Milpitas Midtown Area.

5.1.3           Feasibility of Alternatives

CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and case law on the subject have found that feasibility can be based
on a wide range of factors and influences. CEQA's general definition of feasibility is "capable of
being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account
economic, environmental, legal, social, and technological factors." [Section 15126.6 (f)(1)].

5.1.4           Selection of Alternatives

In addition to "No Project", the CEQA Guidelines advise that the range of alternatives discussed in
an EIR should include those that "would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of
the project." As discussed above, the proposed project would result in a significant transportation
impact at the intersection of Calaveras Boulevard and Abel Street. One project component is the
cause of this significant impact, namely, the closing the existing Carlo Street onramp. The other
components of the project (i.e., modifying signal phasing, re-striping streets, and forgoing planned
mitigation) would not result in a significant impact and would not contribute to the impact at the
Calaveras Boulevard/Abel Street intersection. Therefore, alternatives to these components of the
project are not necessary.

Besides the No Project alternative, there are two alternatives that meet or partially meet the objective
of eliminating the existing unsafe condition. These are: 1) fixing the existing unsafe condition at the
Carlo Street onramp and leaving it open or 2) fixing the existing unsafe condition at the Carlo Street
onramp and constructing the proposed Carlo Street offramp.

5.2             NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE

The CEQA Guidelines require an EIR to include a "No Project" alternative, which addresses both
"the existing conditions, as well as what will be reasonably expected to occur in the foreseeable
future if the project is not approved, based on current plans and consistent with available
infrastructure and community services." Under the No Project alternative, none of the components
of the proposed project would be implemented and all of the environmental impacts of the proposed
project would be avoided. The No Project alternative would meet none of the project objectives.

5.2.1           Conclusion

The No Project alternative would meet none of the project objectives, but would avoid all of the
proposed project's environmental impacts. For this reason, the No Project alternative is an
environmentally superior alternative to the proposed project.

5.3             NO CARLO STREET RAMP CONVERSION ALTERNATIVE

The No Carlo Street Ramp Conversion alternative includes implementing all of the components of
the proposed project, except for converting the Carlo Street onramp to an offramp. The No Carlo

City of Milpitas                               27                                              June 2008
Street Ramp Conversion alternative would avoid the significant unavoidable transportation impact
and the short-term, construction-related air quality and noise impacts that result from the proposed
project. The No Carlo Street Ramp Conversion alternative would meet all of the project objectives,
except for avoiding the existing unsafe condition created by the existing Carlo Street onramp.

5.3.1          Conclusion

The No Carlo Street Ramp Conversion alternative would meet most of the project objectives and
would avoid all of the proposed project's environmental impacts. For this reason, the No Carlo
Street Ramp Conversion alternative is an environmentally superior alternative to the proposed
project.

5.4            RECONSTRUCT CARLO STREET ONRAMP ALTERNATIVE

The Reconstruct Carlo Street Onramp alternative would be a modification of the Carlo Street
component of the proposed project wherein, instead of removing the existing Carlo Street onramp to
eastbound Calaveras Boulevard and building a new offramp, the existing onramp would be
reconstructed in a manner that would address the current safety issues associated with the short
merge distance. Instead of forcing traffic to immediately merge to the left, which is the current
situation, the reconstructed ramp would include a new 1,000-foot receiving lane and a 500-foot
receiving lane. In turn, this would require widening the Calaveras Boulevard bridge because there is
no room for another lane on the existing structure.

The Reconstruct Carlo Street Onramp alternative would avoid the significant transportation impact
resulting from the proposed project and would meet all of the objectives of the proposed project,
except for improving vehicular access to the Midtown Area.

Based on information contained in the Project Study Report for a separate Calaveras Boulevard
Widening Project, the above-described partial widening of the Calaveras Boulevard bridge would be
approximately $25 million. Further, because the long-term plans call for the replacement of the
bridge at a higher profile (i.e., elevation), the $25 million partial widening would be a "throw-away
cost" because the bridge would eventually be demolished. If the City were to choose to replace the
entire bridge now to accommodate the new receiving lane, the cost would be in excess of $50
million.

5.4.1          Conclusion

There is currently no funding to widen the bridge and construct the receiving and merge lanes.
Absent funding, it is not known if and when this alternative would be constructed. Therefore, the
Reconstruct Carlo Street Onramp alternative is not feasible, because there is presently no evidence to
conclude that it could be constructed within a reasonable period of time.

5.5            ONRAMP AND OFFRAMP ALTERNATIVE

In addition to all the components of the Reconstruct Onramp alternative (see above), the Onramp and
Offramp alternative includes construction of a Carlo Street offramp. The offramp for this alternative
would be similar to the offramp proposed by the project, however, modification would be necessary.
The Onramp and Offramp alternative would achieve all the objectives and would avoid all the
impacts of the proposed project.


MMSP Transportation Update                                                                  Draft SEIR

5.5.1          Conclusion

The Onramp and Offramp alternative would be more expensive than the Reconstruct Onramp
alternative, because it also includes construction of an offramp. As is the case with the Reconstruct
Onramp alternative, there is currently no funding for the Onramp and Offramp alternative. Absent
funding, it is not known if and when this alternative would be constructed. Therefore, the Onramp
and Offramp alternative is not feasible, because there is presently no evidence to conclude that it
could be constructed within a reasonable period of time.

SECTION 6               CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

6.1             INTRODUCTION

Cumulative impacts, as defined by CEQA, refer to two or more individual effects, which when
combined, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts.
Cumulative impacts may result from individually minor, but collectively significant projects taking
place over a period of time. The CEQA Guidelines state (§15130) that an EIR should discuss
cumulative impacts "when the project's incremental effect is cumulatively considerable." The
discussion does not need to be in as great detail as is necessary for project impacts, but is to be
"guided by the standards of practicality and reasonableness."

Based on the analysis in this EIR, the proposed project would not contribute to a cumulative
aesthetics, agricultural resource, air quality, biological resource, cultural resource, energy, geology
and soils, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, land use, mineral resource,
noise, population and housing, public services, recreation, or utilities and service systems impact.
This is because the project will not impact these resources or measures are included in the project to
reduce impacts to these resources to a less than significant level.

The proposed project results in a significant unavoidable transportation impact and, therefore, it is
possible that the project in combination with past, present, and reasonably future projects could have
a cumulatively significant transportation impact.

6.2             CUMULATIVE TRANSPORTATION IMPACTS

A cumulative transportation analysis was completed for the proposed project per the City of Milpitas
Guidelines. The analysis evaluated projected roadway link volumes for two Year 2030 scenarios,
2030 No Project and 2030 Plus Project. This long-term analysis evaluated roadway link volumes
because estimating intersection turning movement volumes in 2030 is considered speculative.

Year 2030 AM and PM peak-hour roadway segment traffic volumes were developed using the
Valley Transportation Authority's (VTA) Congestion Management Program (CMP) year 2030
Travel Demand Forecast (TDF) model. This regional model is includes buildout of the City of
Milpitas according to its adopted General Plan.

Year 2030 No Project volumes assume no components of the project are implemented. The roadway
segment levels of service under 2030 No Project and 2030 Plus Project were compared to determine
if the proposed project would result in a significant cumulative transportation impact.

Under cumulative conditions, the proposed project will have beneficial impact on a roadway
segment if:

        ·       The roadway segment is projected to operate below its LOS standard under 2030 No
                Project and the proposed project is expected to cause a decrease in traffic of at least
                one percent of its capacity.




MMSP Transportation Update                                                                    Draft SEIR
City of Milpitas                               30                                              June 2008
Under cumulative conditions, the proposed project will have an adverse significant impact on a
roadway segment if:

       ·       The roadway segment is projected to operate below its LOS standard under the
               existing general plan and the proposed general plan change is projected to cause an
               increase in traffic of at least one percent of its capacity, or

       ·       The roadway segment is projected to operate at or better than its LOS standard under
               the existing general plan and the proposed general plan change is projected to
               degrade the level of service to less than acceptable levels.

For roadway segments controlled by the CMA, the minimum acceptable level of service is LOS E.
The minimum acceptable level of service for non-CMA roadway segments in the City of Milpitas is
LOS D. Calaveras Boulevard, Montague Expressway, I-880, and SR 237 are the nearby CMA
roadways included in the cumulative analysis.

Based on the criteria above, comparison of 2030 No Project to 2030 Plus Project roadway segment
LOS indicates the project would have both significant beneficial and adverse impacts. The proposed
project would have a beneficial significant impact on the following roadway segments, because 2030
No Project operations on these segments are projected to be below LOS D and the traffic diversion
caused by the proposed project would decrease traffic at least one percent of the segment capacity:

       ·       Main Street (southbound), between Calaveras Boulevard Ramp and Carlo Street
               Ramp (AM Peak)
       ·       Main Street (southbound), between Calaveras Boulevard Ramp and Carlo Street
               Ramp (PM Peak)
       ·       Main Street (northbound), between Carlo Street Ramp and Curtis Avenue (PM Peak)

The proposed project would have an adverse significant impact the following roadway segments,
because 2030 No Project operations on these segments are projected to be below LOS D and the
traffic diversion caused by the proposed project would increase traffic at least one percent of the
segment capacity:

       ·       Abel Street (southbound), between North Milpitas Boulevard and Calaveras
               Boulevard (AM Peak)
       ·       Abel Street (northbound), between Calaveras Boulevard and Great Mall Parkway
               (PM Peak)
       ·       Main Street (northbound), between Weller Lane and Calaveras Boulevard Ramp (PM
               Peak)
       ·       Main Street (northbound), between Calaveras Boulevard Ramp and Carlo Street
               Ramp (PM Peak)

Impact CM-1: Abel Street southbound between Milpitas Boulevard and Calaveras Boulevard would
operate at LOS F under 2030 No Project conditions during the AM peak hour. The Carlo Street ramp
conversion would add traffic in the amount of two percent of capacity to this segment. [Significant
Impact]




MMSP Transportation Update                                                                   Draft SEIR

Impact CM-2: Abel Street northbound between Calaveras Boulevard and Great Mall Parkway
would operate at LOS E under 2030 No Project conditions during the PM peak hour. The Carlo
Street ramp conversion would add traffic in the amount of 13 percent of capacity to this segment.
[Significant Impact]

Impact CM-3: Main Street northbound between Weller Lane and Calaveras Boulevard Ramp would
operate at LOS F under 2030 No Project conditions during the PM peak hour. The Carlo Street
ramp conversion would add traffic in the amount of 2.8 percent of capacity to this segment.
[Significant Impact]

Impact CM-4: Main Street northbound between Calaveras Boulevard Ramp and Carlo
Street Ramp would operate at LOS F under 2030 No Project conditions during the PM peak hour.
The Carlo Street ramp conversion would add traffic in the amount of 2.1 percent of capacity to this
segment. [Significant Impact]

6.2.1           Mitigation for Cumulative Traffic Impacts

The significant cumulative transportation impacts on Abel Street occur immediately around the
intersection of Calaveras Boulevard at Abel Street. The mitigation measures identified in Section
4.16 TRANSPORTATION for the project's significant unavoidable transportation impact would
also mitigate the significant cumulative impacts on Abel Street. However, as previously discussed,
these mitigation measures are not feasible.

The significant cumulative transportation impacts on Main Street can be mitigated by widening Main
Street to provide additional through lanes, thereby increasing roadway capacity. However, widening
Main Street is not consistent with the City's North Main Street Streetscape project, which is intended
to create a more pedestrian friendly environment. Therefore, the mitigation for the significant
cumulative transportation impacts on Main Street is not feasible.

The City of Milpitas will prepare a deficiency plan as required by the VTA to address significant and
unavoidable impacts.

6.2.2           Cumulative Traffic Impact Conclusion

There are no feasible mitigation measures to reduce the significant cumulative transportation impacts
to a less than significant level. For this reason, the cumulative transportation impacts are significant
and unavoidable. The project will, however, have beneficial cumulative impacts on Main Street
between the Calaveras Boulevard ramp and Curtis Avenue. [Significant Unavoidable Impact]

SECTION 7               GROWTH INDUCING IMPACTS

The proposed Milpitas Midtown Specific Plan Transportation Update would not expand roadway
facilities or otherwise foster growth (e.g., expand utilities). For these reasons, the proposed project
would not result in growth inducing impacts.

SECTION 8              SIGNIFICANT UNAVOIDABLE IMPACTS

As discussed in SECTION 4.17 TRANSPORTATION and SECTION 6.2 CUMULATIVE
TRANSPORTATION IMPACTS of this SEIR, the proposed project would result in the following
significant unavoidable impact:

       ·       The project would degrade operations at the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras
               Boulevard during the PM peak hour from LOS E to LOS F. [Significant
               Unavoidable Impact]

       ·       The project would contribute to significant unavoidable cumulative impacts on
               segments of Main Street and Abel Street during both the AM and PM peak hours.
               [Significant Unavoidable Impact]




MMSP Transportation Update                                                                Draft SEIR

SECTION 9               SCOPING, COORDINDATION, AND MEETINGS

Per Section 15082 of the CEQA Guidelines, the City circulated a Notice of Preparation (NOP) of an
EIR for the proposed project from January 28, 2008 through February 27, 2008. The City received
two letters in response to the NOP. Both comment letters were from the California Department of
Transportation (Caltrans). A copy of the NOP and responses to the NOP are included as Appendix A
of this EIR.

9.1             Letter from Caltrans dated February 19, 2008

This letter from Caltrans stated that the future construction of a second left turn lane from eastbound
Calaveras Boulevard to northbound Abel Street is needed for future traffic volumes at this
intersection and, therefore, should not be eliminated.

The City of Milpitas decided to retain this component of the proposed project for the following
reasons: 1) eliminating the future construction of the second left turn lane would not result in a
significant traffic impact (refer to Section 4.16 Transportation of this EIR), 2) a second left turn lane
is not included in the traffic analysis prepared for Calaveras Boulevard Preliminary Study Report
(PSR) in conjunction with Caltrans, 3) the second left turn lane requires additional right-of-way on
the north side of Calaveras Boulevard and widening the Wrigley Creek box culvert, and 4) widening
the Wrigley Creek box culvert would result in water quality and riparian habitat impacts. The City
met with Caltrans on March 19, 2008 to discuss this issue and explain their reasons for eliminating
the future second left turn. Caltrans will be sent a copy of this EIR.

9.2             Letter from Caltrans dated February 27, 2008

This letter requested that the SEIR analyze impacts upon pedestrians, bicyclists, and
pedestrian/bicycle access to transit facilities in the project area, as well as secondary impacts on these
modes resulting from mitigation measures for traffic impacts.

As stated in Section 1 Introduction, Background, and Project Objectives of this SEIR, improving
bicycle and pedestrian circulation in the Midtown Area are objectives of the proposed project. The
proposed project includes construction of new sidewalks on Carlo Street, lane reduction on Main
Street to increase the width of existing bike lanes and enhance pedestrian facilities by allowing street
parking, which would separate vehicles from motorists. The project would also reduce the length of
the crosswalk at the east leg of the intersection of Main Street and Abel Street and forego widening
the intersection of Calaveras Boulevard and Abel Street, both of which improve pedestrian facilities
in the Midtown Area. As discussed in Section 4.16 Transportation, the proposed project would not
impact pedestrian or bicycle facilities.

Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic impacts of four proposed improvement projects in the
Midtown area of Milpitas, California. The improvement projects include the following:

1) Convert the eastbound Carlo Street On-Ramp at Calaveras Boulevard to an eastbound off-ramp. The
    existing on-ramp to Calaveras Boulevard is substandard in many respects: (1) the radii of the ramp is
    insufficient for vehicles on the ramp to match speeds with traffic on Calaveras Boulevard, (2) The
    lane drop taper at Calaveras Boulevard is far less than current design standards, (3) The length of
    merge (i.e. the distance before two full lanes become one lane) is insufficient for on-ramp traffic to
    safely locate a gap in traffic on eastbound Calaveras Boulevard. Eliminating this sub-standard merge
    would improve overall safety on eastbound Calaveras Boulevard between Milpitas Boulevard and
    Abel Street.

2) Reduce Main Street between Abel Street and Great Mall Parkway from five lanes (two lanes in each
   direction) to three lanes (one in each direction with a two way center left turn lane). The lane
   reduction will improve safety by reducing Main Street from four lanes to two lanes, which would
   allow for wider northbound and southbound bike lanes and a wider parking strip on the west side of
   Main Street. The improvement will not result in a lane reduction at the intersection of Great Mall
   Parkway/Main Street.

3) Eliminate future construction of a second left turn lane from eastbound Calaveras Boulevard to
   northbound Abel Street. This was a mitigation in the Midtown Milpitas Specific Plan EIR dated
   October 2001, but further study revealed that biology impacts, water quality impacts to Wrigley
   Creek, and land use/acquisition impacts would occur as a result of the improvement.

4) Modify signal phasing at the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard to allow
   simultaneous southbound right-turn and eastbound left-turn movements. This improvement would
   improve overall traffic flow on Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard.

The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the standards set forth by the City
of Milpitas and the Congestion Management Program (CMP) of Santa Clara County. The study included
an analysis of AM and PM peak hour traffic conditions for 15 signalized intersections and 3 unsignalized
intersections.

Re-Assignment of Traffic
For the near-term analysis, the impact of converting the eastbound on-ramp at Calaveras Boulevard to an
eastbound off-ramp was evaluated in two phases. The first phase (hereafter referred to as Phase 1)
includes the closure of the on-ramp from Main Street to eastbound Calaveras Boulevard. During this
phase, access to eastbound Calaveras Boulevard from Main Street will be closed, but the off-ramp from
eastbound Calaveras Boulevard would not yet be opened. The second phase (hereafter referred to as
Phase 2) represents the full implementation of the improvement projects, including both the closure of the
on-ramp and the opening of the new off-ramp. Both Phases 1 and 2 of this analysis include all of the
other proposed improvement projects previously described.

The improvement project to rebuild the Carlo Street Ramp from an on-ramp to eastbound Calaveras
Boulevard to an off-ramp would change travel routes for drivers entering and exiting Midtown. The
changes are outlined below.

Phase 1 Diversion. With the on-ramp to Calaveras Boulevard eliminated, drivers exiting the Midtown
area would have two options for reaching eastern destinations. First, for traffic originating south of
Calaveras Boulevard on Main Street, drivers would likely divert to northbound Abel Street (via Serra
Way, Corning Avenue, or some other parallel route farther south) and make a right turn at the intersection
of Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard. Based on the existing traffic counts and the Midtown traffic
projections, the vast majority of traffic exiting Midtown would choose this route. Second, for traffic
originating north of Calaveras Boulevard on Main Street, drivers would likely divert to southbound Abel
Street (via Weller Lane) and turn left at the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard. Overall,
for drivers exiting Midtown, the on-ramp closure would result in significantly more trips at the Abel
Street/Calaveras Boulevard intersection for the northbound right turn movement and southbound left turn
movement.

Phase 2 Diversion. The diversion for Phase 2 would include all of the diversion of Phase 1, plus it would
provide another primary route for drivers to enter Midtown. With the opening of the off-ramp from
Calaveras Boulevard to Main Street, drivers would have three primary routes to enter the Midtown area
from west Milpitas. First, eastbound drivers could choose to take Calaveras Boulevard just past Abel
Street to the new Carlo Street Off-Ramp. The off-ramp provides direct access to Midtown Milpitas.
Second, vehicles heading eastbound on Calaveras Boulevard could turn right on Serra Way, also
providing direct access to Midtown Milpitas. Due to the heavy traffic volumes on Calaveras Boulevard
during the PM peak, it is anticipated that many drivers will continue to utilize Serra Way to access
Midtown. Third, eastbound drivers on Calaveras Boulevard could choose to turn left at Abel Street to
access Weller Lane or Marylinn Drive to enter Midtown. However, with the proposed ramp conversion,
drivers would be less likely to make a left at Abel Street because the new ramp would provide a more
direct route for some destinations within Midtown. Overall, for drivers entering Midtown, the ramp
conversion would result in fewer trips eastbound on Serra Way and fewer trips for the eastbound left turn
movement at the Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard intersection. The ramp conversion would result in more
eastbound through trips at the intersection of Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard.

The peak hour trips generated by Phases 1 and 2 of the proposed ramp conversion were assigned to the
roadway system in accordance with the trip redistribution patterns discussed above. None of the other
project improvements would result in significant traffic diversion.

Near Term Intersection Impacts and Mitigation
Project impacts were determined based on the appropriate significance criteria. The results of the
intersection level of service analysis show one of the signalized study intersections would be impacted by
the project (see Table ES-1).

     Significant Impact: The intersection of Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard would operate at LOS E
     under Near Term No Project conditions during the PM peak hour. Under Phase 1 and 2 project
     conditions it would degrade to LOS F. According to the CMP guidelines, this would constitute a
     significant impact.

    Mitigation: The 2030 Valley Transportation Plan (VTP) includes a range of highway and transit
    improvement projects to ease existing and future traffic congestion along major travel corridors in
    Santa Clara County. The widening of Calaveras Boulevard, between Milpitas Boulevard and Abel
    Street, is the highest priority project under the Street and Local Roads category and at least 80% of
    the necessary project funding may be secured from federal sources as part of the VTP. To mitigate the
    significant impact, as part of the widening of Calaveras widening project, the following would be
    required:

    ·   Add one additional westbound left turn lane on Calaveras Boulevard (for a total of 2 left turn
        lanes), and
    ·   Restripe the northbound approach on Abel Street from a two through lanes and one right turn lane
        to one through lane, one shared right/through lane, and one right turn lane. This may require
        modifications to the crosswalks at the intersection.

    The implementation of this mitigation would return the LOS to E during the PM peak hour.
    However, the implementation of these improvements may have secondary affects that result in
    additional undesirable impacts. The addition of a second right turn lane northbound on Abel Street
    could result in safety issues for pedestrians in the adjacent crosswalk. While removal of the crosswalk
    would eliminate the potential safety issue, crosswalk removal would decrease pedestrian mobility in
    the Midtown area, which is contrary to the goals of the Midtown Specific Plan. In addition, the
    additional westbound left turn lane on Calaveras Boulevard results in alignment issues with the
    Calaveras Blvd PSR and additional right-of-way on Calaveras Boulevard. Furthermore, this
    improvement is not likely feasible without the widening of Calaveras Boulevard bridge between Abel
    Street and Milpitas Boulevard, which may not occur for many years. Considering all these issues, the
    City of Milpitas has decided that the Phase 1 and 2 impacts at Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard
    should be considered significant and unavoidable. Because Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard is
    designated as a CMP intersection, and the intersection is subject to regional monitoring, the City of
    Milpitas has opted to prepare a deficiency plan to offset the significant and unavoidable impacts at
    this location.


Year 2030 Traffic Analysis
The analysis of 2030 conditions was conducted only for the full build out of the four proposed
improvement projects (Phase 2 only). Phase 1 (onramp closure only) represents an interim condition
likely to occur during construction of the new off-ramp. It would be completed well in advance of 2030.

Project conditions were evaluated relative to No Project 2030 in order to determine potential impacts. As
expected, many of the roadway segments would operate a LOS E or F by the year 2030. Even though the
2030 roadway network assumes several major roadway capacity improvements, the anticipated growth in
jobs and housing would cause the traffic to increase substantially and cause increased congestion on the
transportation system.

The proposed improvement projects would have a beneficial significant impact on the following roadway
segments in both the AM and PM Peak Hour:

    ·   Main Street (southbound), between Calaveras Boulevard Ramp and Carlo Street Ramp (AM Peak)
    ·   Main Street (northbound), between Carlo Street Ramp and Curtis Avenue (PM Peak)
    ·   Main Street (southbound), between Calaveras Boulevard Ramp and Carlo Street Ramp (PM Peak)

The proposed improvement projects would have an adverse significant impact the following roadway
segments in both the AM and PM peak hours:

    ·   Abel Street (southbound), between Milpitas Boulevard and Calaveras Boulevard (AM Peak)
    ·   Abel Street (northbound), between Calaveras Boulevard and Great Mall Parkway (PM Peak)
    ·   Main Street (northbound), between Weller Lane and Calaveras Boulevard Ramp (PM Peak)
    ·   Main Street (northbound), between Calaveras Boulevard Ramp and Carlo Street Ramp (PM Peak)

    Significant Impact: Abel Street southbound between Milpitas Boulevard and Calaveras Boulevard
    would operate at LOS F under No Project 2030 conditions during the AM peak hour. The Carlo Street
    ramp conversion would add traffic in the amount of 2% of capacity to this segment. According to the
    Milpitas significance criteria, this would constitute a significant impact. The significant impacts on
    Abel Street between Milpitas Boulevard and Calaveras Boulevard occur immediately around the
    intersection of Calaveras Boulevard at Abel Street. Thus, the improvements to this intersection would
    effectively mitigate the impacts of the Carlo Street ramp diversion. However, as previously described,
    for various reasons, the City has considered these improvements infeasible and considers the impacts
    on this segment to be significant and unavoidable.

    Significant Impact: Abel Street northbound between Calaveras Boulevard and Great Mall Parkway
    would operate at LOS E under No Project 2030 conditions during the PM peak hour. The Carlo Street
    ramp conversion would add traffic in the amount of 13% of capacity to this segment. According to
    the Milpitas significance criteria, this would constitute a significant impact. The significant impacts
    on Abel Street between Great Mall Parkway and Calaveras Boulevard occur immediately around the
    intersection of Calaveras Boulevard at Abel Street. Thus, the improvements to this intersection would
    effectively mitigate the impacts of the Carlo Street ramp diversion. However, as previously described,
    for various reasons, the City has considered these improvements infeasible and considers the impacts
    on this segment to be significant and unavoidable.

    Significant Impact: Main Street northbound between Weller Lane and Calaveras Boulevard Ramp
    would operate at LOS F under No Project 2030 conditions during the PM peak hour. The Carlo Street
    ramp conversion would add traffic in the amount of 2.8% of capacity to this segment. According to
    the Milpitas significance criteria, this would constitute a significant impact. Mitigation of significant
    project impacts on these segments of Main Street would require roadway widening to construct
    additional through lanes, thereby increasing roadway capacity. However, widening is not consistent
    with the City's North Main Street Streetscape Project, which is currently under construction and is
    intended to create a more walkable environment. Therefore, the significant impacts on this segment
    should be considered significant and unavoidable.

    Significant Impact: Main Street northbound between Calaveras Boulevard Ramp and Carlo Street
    Ramp would operate at LOS F under No Project 2030 conditions during the PM peak hour. The Carlo
    Street ramp conversion would add traffic in the amount of 2.1% of capacity to this segment.
    According to the Milpitas significance criteria, this would constitute a significant impact. Mitigation
    of significant project impacts on these segments of Main Street would require roadway widening to
    construct additional through lanes, thereby increasing roadway capacity. However, widening is not
    consistent with the City's North Main Street Streetscape Project, which is currently under construction
    and is intended to create a more walkable environment. Therefore, the significant impacts on this
    segment should be considered significant and unavoidable.

Introduction
This report presents the results of the traffic impacts of four proposed improvement projects in the
Midtown area of Milpitas, California. The improvement projects include the following:

1) Convert the eastbound Carlo Street On-Ramp at Calaveras Boulevard to an eastbound off-ramp. The
   existing on-ramp to Calaveras Boulevard is substandard in many respects: (1) the radii of the ramp is
   insufficient for vehicles on the ramp to match speeds with traffic on Calaveras Boulevard, (2) The
   lane drop taper at Calaveras Boulevard is far less than current design standards. (3) The length of
   merge (i.e. the distance before two full lanes become one lane) is insufficient for on-ramp traffic to
   safely locate a gap in traffic on eastbound Calaveras Boulevard. Eliminating this sub-standard merge
   would improve overall safety on eastbound Calaveras Boulevard between Milpitas Boulevard and
   Abel Street.

2) Reduce Main Street between Abel Street and Great Mall Parkway from five lanes (two lanes in each
   direction) to three lanes (one in each direction with a two way center left turn lane). The lane
   reduction will improve safety by reducing Main Street from four lanes to two lanes, which would
   allow for wider northbound and southbound bike lanes and a wider parking strip on the west side of
   Main Street. The improvement will not result in a lane reduction at the intersection of Great Mall
   Parkway/Main Street.

3) Eliminate future construction of a second left turn lane from eastbound Calaveras Boulevard to
   northbound Abel Street. This was a mitigation in the Midtown Milpitas Specific Plan EIR dated
   October 2001, but further study revealed that biology impacts, water quality impacts to Wrigley
   Creek, and land use/acquisition impacts would occur as a result of the improvement.

4) Modify signal phasing at the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard to allow
   simultaneous southbound right-turn and eastbound left-turn movements. This improvement would
   improve overall traffic flow on Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard.

The projects and the surrounding study area are shown on Figure 1. The Carlo Street ramp conversion is
shown graphically on Figure 2.

Scope of Study
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts of the four
previously described improvement projects relative to the existing Midtown Milpitas Specific Plan. This
analysis does not include an update of the impacts and mitigations required as a result of the land uses
contained in the Midtown Milpitas Specific Plan. The impacts of the project were evaluated following the
standards and methodologies set forth by the City of Milpitas and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA). The VTA administers the county Congestion Management Program (CMP). The traffic
analysis is based on peak hour levels of service for the study intersections. The traffic analysis also
includes an evaluation of peak hour signal warrants for the unsignalized intersections of Main
Street/Calaveras Boulevard Off-Ramp and Main Street/Carlo Street. The Main Street/Weller Lane
unsignalized intersection is reverting back to a signalized intersection prior to project completion.
Therefore, an evaluation of peak hour signal warrants is unnecessary for the intersection. The study
intersections are identified below.

CMP intersections are denoted with an asterisk (*).

Traffic conditions at the study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours of
traffic. The AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM, and the PM peak hour is
typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the most congested traffic conditions
occur on an average day. Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:

   Scenario 1:     Existing Conditions. Existing conditions were represented by existing peak hour traffic
                   volumes on the existing roadway network. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from
                   the City of Milpitas.

    Scenario 2: Near Term No Project Conditions. Near Term No Project conditions were represented
                by future traffic volumes on the near-term future roadway network. Near Term No
                Project traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing peak hour volumes the
                traffic from the Midtown Milpitas Specific Plan and the traffic volumes from approved
                but not yet completed developments. The latter components are contained in the City of
                Milpitas Approved Trips Inventory (ATI) and the North San Jose project.
    Scenario 3:    Project Conditions. Project conditions were represented by future traffic volumes, with
                   the proposed projects, on the near-term future roadway network. Future traffic volumes
                   with the project (hereafter called project traffic volumes) were estimated by adding to
                   Near Term No Project traffic volumes the diversion generated by the proposed projects.
                   The proposed improvement projects were evaluated relative to Near Term No Project
                   conditions in order to determine potential project impacts.

    Scenario 4 : Year 2030 Conditions. Future conditions were represented by year 2030 traffic volumes
                 with and without the proposed improvement projects. Base traffic volumes were
                 obtained from the McCarthy Ranch R&D TIA, dated September 25, 2007. Per City of
                 Milpitas requirements, roadway segments were evaluated for year 2030 conditions.


Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described
above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable
level of service standards.

Data Requirements

The data required for the analysis were obtained from field observations, previous traffic studies, the City
of Milpitas, and the CMP annual Monitoring Report. The following data were collected from these
sources:

·   existing traffic volumes
·   lane configurations
·   signal timing and phasing (for signalized intersections only)
·   approved trips inventory for Milpitas
·   North San Jose Phase One
·   planned roadway improvements
·   Milpitas 2030 base year forecasts

Analysis Methodologies

Traffic conditions at the study locations were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service is a
qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or
no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays.

The City of Milpitas and CMP level of service methodologies utilize TRAFFIX software using CMP
default settings. TRAFFIX is based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method for
intersections, and evaluates intersection operations on the basis of average delay for all vehicles at the

intersection. This average delay can then be correlated to a level of service as shown in Table 1 for
signalized intersections. The level of service correlation for unsignalized intersections is shown in Table
2. For two-way stop controlled intersections, the level of service reported is for the worst approach of the
intersection.

              and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures begin to
              appear.
     D        Operations with longer delays due to a combination of unfavorable                    35.1 to 55.0
              progression, long cycle lengths, or high V/C ratios. Many vehicles
              stop and individual cycle failures are noticeable.
     E        Operations with high delay values indicating poor progression, long                  55.1 to 80.0
              cycle lengths, and high V/C ratios. Individual cycle failures are
               frequent occurrences. This is considered to be the limit of
              acceptable delay.
      F       Operation with delays unacceptable to most drivers occurring due                 Greater than 80.0
              to oversaturation, poor progression, or very long cycle lengths.

In addition to the level of service evaluation, for unsignalized intersections an assessment is made of the
need for signalization of the intersection. This assessment is made on the basis of the Peak hour Volume
Signal Warrant described in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), 2003. This
method makes no evaluation of intersection level of service, but simply provides an indication whether
peak hour traffic volumes are, or would be, sufficient to justify installation of a traffic signal.

Roadway Segments

For 2030 conditions, the traffic operations at the study segments were calculated based on the volume-to-
capacity ratio, which can be correlated to a level of service. Table 3 shows the roadway types, capacity
assumptions, and LOS thresholds that were used for this analysis.

Level of Service Standards

For CMP intersections, roadway segments, and freeway segments, the minimum acceptable level of
service is LOS E. At intersections and roadway segments in Milpitas that are not CMP intersections, the
minimum acceptable level of service is LOS D.

Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all the major roadway facilities in the vicinity of the
site, including the roadway network, levels of service, and field observations.


Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the Midtown area is provided via I-880, I-680, and SR 237/Calaveras Boulevard.
These facilities are described below.

        I-680 is a north/south freeway traversing the eastern portion of Milpitas. This freeway connects
        the inland East Bay communities to the north with San Jose to the south. I-680 has six mixed flow
        lanes north of SR 237 and eight mixed flow lanes south of SR 237. A southbound HOV lane is
        currently in operation north of Calaveras Boulevard.

        I-880 is a north/south freeway providing regional access from East Bay cities to San Jose, where
        it becomes SR 17. Within the City of Milpitas, I-880 is a six-to-eight lane freeway. The initial
        construction phases of the SR 237/I-880 interchange have recently been completed. South of
        Montague Expressway, I-880 has recently been widened to six lanes.

        State Route 237/Calaveras Boulevard is an east/west arterial between I-880 and I-680 and
        generally provides six travel lanes (four on the Union Pacific overcrossing). West of I-880, this
        facility becomes a freeway with four mixed flow lanes and two High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV)
        lanes. Calaveras Boulevard accommodates a significant amount of regional through traffic during
        the peak commute hours. Milpitas staff estimate that approximately 50 percent of the peak hour
        traffic between I-680 and I-880 is generated outside of Milpitas. The predominate direction of
        travel is westbound in the morning and eastbound during the afternoon.

Local access to the Midtown area is provided by Abel Street and Main Street. These roadways are
described below.

        Abel Street is a four-lane north/south arterial beginning at Main Street and terminating at Milpitas
        Boulevard. This roadway provides a two-way center left-turn lane along some segments. This
        facility is signalized at major cross streets, where left-turn pockets are provided. On-street
        parking is generally prohibited, except adjacent to residential frontage.

        Main Street is a north/south collector connecting Montague Expressway to residential areas north
        of Calaveras Boulevard. This roadway consists of four travel lanes from Montague Expressway to
        just north of Curtis Avenue, where it transitions to a two lane facility with parking on both sides.
        Main Street currently operates within capacity, but experiences peak hour congestion at its
        intersection with Montague Expressway.


Existing Intersection Lane Configurations & Traffic Volumes
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were determined by observations in the field.
The existing intersection lane configurations are shown on Figure 3. Existing peak hour traffic volumes
were obtained from the City of Milpitas. The existing peak hour intersection volumes are shown on
Figure 4. The traffic count data are included in Appendix A.


Existing Intersection Level of Service

The level of service results for the signalized and unsignalized intersections under existing conditions are
summarized in Table 4. The results show that, measured against the City of Milpitas level of service
standards, all of the study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels. The level of service
calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.



Existing Signal Warrants
The peak hour signal warrant (MUTCD, 2003) was checked for the unsignalized intersections of Main
Street/Calaveras Boulevard Off-Ramp and Main Street/Carlo Street On-Ramp to determine whether
signalization would be justified on the basis of existing peak hour volumes. The analysis showed that the
peak hour volume signal warrant is not satisfied under existing conditions at any of the intersections.
However, this is just one of eleven possible signal warrants. The signal warrants analysis sheets are
included in Appendix E.


Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and to
confirm the accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify any
existing traffic problems that may not be directly related to level of service, and (2) to identify any
locations where the level of service analysis does not accurately reflect existing traffic conditions.

Overall, the level of service analysis appears to accurately reflect actual existing traffic conditions.
However, field observations revealed that some operational problems do occur.

Hillview Drive and Calaveras Boulevard ­ During the PM peak hours, the eastbound traffic queue was
unable to clear the intersection in one signal cycle. Traffic queues would stretch past the Calaveras
Boulevard/Town Center Drive intersection to the west.

I-880 (NB ramps) and Calaveras Boulevard ­ During the PM peak hours, the westbound right turn queue
to I-880 North spills out into Calaveras Boulevard. A queue of fifteen cars was observed on Calaveras
Boulevard. This was caused by heavy traffic northbound on I-880.

It should be noted that Calaveras Boulevard, an eastern extension of SR 237, provides a link between the
major interstate highways I-880 and I-680. As expected, heavy traffic volumes were observed on
Calaveras Boulevard during commute hours. Intersections along Calaveras Boulevard operated well
considering the high traffic volumes.

Near Term No Project Conditions
This chapter describes Near Term No Project traffic conditions. It shows the resulting levels of service at
the study intersections based on the most recent available traffic counts and assuming a Near Term
buildout of the Midtown Milpitas Specific Plan. Near Term No Project traffic volumes were estimated by
adding to existing peak hour volumes the traffic from the Midtown Milpitas Specific Plan and the traffic
volumes from approved but not yet completed developments. This chapter describes both the procedure
used to determine Near Term No Project traffic volumes and the resulting traffic conditions.


Near Term No Project Transportation Network & Traffic Volumes
It is assumed in this analysis that the future near-term roadway network at the study intersections would
be the same as existing conditions, except this scenario also includes the improvements required as
mitigation in the Midtown Milpitas Specific Plan EIR dated October 2001 as well as programmed Capital
Improvement Projects (CIP). These improvements include:

·   An additional eastbound left-turn at the Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard intersection (Midtown
    Milpitas Specific Plan EIR mitigation) and
·   Median improvements on Main Street and Abel Street (CIP Projects) and
·   Signalization of Main Street and Weller Lane.

Near Term No Project peak hour traffic volumes were calculated by adding to existing volumes the
estimated traffic from approved but not yet constructed developments and traffic from the Midtown
Milpitas Specific Plan. The added traffic from approved but not yet constructed developments was
provided by Milpitas in the form of an Approved Trips Inventory (ATI). Trips from the North San Jose
Phase One buildout were also added to the ATI. Traffic from the buildout of Midtown was estimated from
the Midtown Milpitas Specific Plan EIR dated October 2001. In cases where Midtown Milpitas Specific
Plan development traffic was also included in the Milpitas ATI or has been built, the duplication of trips
was removed from the Near Term No Project traffic volume estimates. Near Term No Project traffic
volumes are shown on Figure 5. A full description of the ATI is included in Appendix B.

Near Term No Project Intersection Analysis
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under Near Term No Project conditions are
summarized in Table 5. The results show that the intersection of Milpitas Boulevard/Calaveras Boulevard
would operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour. The remaining study intersections would operate at an
acceptable LOS. The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.


Near Term No Project Signal Warrants
The peak hour signal warrant (MUTCD, 2003) was checked at the unsignalized intersections of Main
Street/Calaveras Boulevard Off-Ramp and Main Street/Carlo Street On-Ramp to determine whether
signalization would be justified on the basis of Near Term No Project peak hour volumes. The analysis
showed that the peak hour volume signal warrant is not satisfied under Near Term No Project conditions
at any the intersections. However, this is just one of eleven possible signal warrants checks. The signal
warrant analysis sheets are included in Appendix E.

Project Impacts and Mitigation Measures
This chapter describes project traffic conditions, significant project impacts, and measures that are
recommended to mitigate impacts. Included are descriptions of the significance criteria that define an
intersection impact, estimates of project-generated traffic, identification of the impacts, and descriptions
of the mitigation measures. Project conditions are represented by Near Term No Project traffic conditions
plus the implementation of the four proposed improvement projects.

Transportation Network Under Project Conditions
The proposed improvement projects would make the following changes to the roadway network. Other
than these changes, it is assumed in this analysis that the near-term roadway network under project
conditions would be the same as described under Near Term No Project conditions.

1.   Convert the eastbound Carlo Street On-Ramp at Calaveras Boulevard to an eastbound off-ramp

2. Reduce Main Street between Abel Street and Great Mall Parkway from five lanes (two lanes in each
   direction) to three lanes (one in each direction with a two way center left turn lane). This
   improvement will not result in a lane reduction at the intersection of Great Mall Parkway/ Main
   Street. At the intersection of Abel Street/Main Street, the westbound right turn traffic island will be
   removed and the number of approach lanes on Main Street will be reduced from three to two.

3. Eliminate future construction of a second left turn lane from eastbound Calaveras Boulevard to
   northbound Abel Street.

4. Modify signal phasing at the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard to allow
   simultaneous southbound right-turn and eastbound left-turn movements.

For the purposes of this analysis, the impact of converting the eastbound on-ramp at Calaveras Boulevard
to an eastbound off-ramp was evaluated in two phases. The first phase (hereafter referred to as Phase 1)
includes the closure of the on-ramp from Main Street to eastbound Calaveras Boulevard. During this
phase, access to eastbound Calaveras Boulevard from Main Street will be closed, but the off-ramp from
eastbound Calaveras Boulevard would not yet be opened. The second phase (hereafter referred to as

Milpitas Midtown Improvement Plans TIA                                                                    18
Phase 2) represents the full implementation of the improvement projects, including both the closure of the
on-ramp and the opening of the new off-ramp. Both Phases 1 and 2 of this analysis include all of the
other proposed improvement projects described above.


Re-Assignment of Traffic
The improvement project to rebuild the Carlo Street Ramp from an on-ramp to eastbound Calaveras
Boulevard to an off-ramp would change travel routes for drivers entering and exiting Midtown. The
changes are outlined below.

Phase 1 Diversion. With the on-ramp to Calaveras Boulevard eliminated, drivers exiting the Midtown
area would have two options for reaching eastern destinations. First, for traffic originating south of
Calaveras Boulevard on Main Street, drivers would likely divert to northbound Abel Street (via Serra
Way, Corning Avenue, or some other parallel route farther south) and make a right turn at the intersection
of Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard. Based on the existing traffic counts and the Midtown traffic
projections, the vast majority of traffic exiting Midtown would choose this route. Second, for traffic
originating north of Calaveras Boulevard on Main Street, drivers would likely divert to southbound Abel
Street (via Weller Lane) and turn left at the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard. Overall,
for drivers exiting Midtown, the on-ramp closure would result in significantly more trips at the Abel
Street/Calaveras Boulevard intersection for the northbound right turn movement and southbound left turn
movement.

Phase 2 Diversion. The diversion for Phase 2 would include all of the diversion of Phase 1, plus it would
provide another primary route for drivers to enter Midtown. With the opening of the off-ramp from
Calaveras Boulevard to Main Street, drivers would have three primary routes to enter the Midtown area
from west Milpitas. First, eastbound drivers could choose to take Calaveras Boulevard just past Abel
Street to the new Carlo Street Off-Ramp. The off-ramp provides direct access to Midtown Milpitas.
Second, vehicles heading eastbound on Calaveras Boulevard could turn right on Serra Way, also
providing direct access to Midtown Milpitas. Due to the heavy traffic volumes on Calaveras Boulevard
during the PM peak, it is anticipated that many drivers will continue to utilize Serra Way to access
Midtown. Third, eastbound drivers on Calaveras Boulevard could choose to turn left at Abel Street to
access Weller Lane or Marylinn Drive to enter Midtown. However, with the proposed ramp conversion,
drivers would be less likely to make a left at Abel Street because the new ramp would provide a more
direct route for some destinations within Midtown. Overall, for drivers entering Midtown, the ramp
conversion would result in fewer trips eastbound on Serra Way and fewer trips for the eastbound left turn
movement at the Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard intersection. The ramp conversion would result in more
eastbound through trips at the intersection of Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard.

The peak hour diversion generated by Phases 1 and 2 of the proposed ramp conversion were assigned to
the roadway system in accordance with the trip redistribution patterns discussed above. None of the other
project improvements would result in significant traffic diversion. Project trip volumes are tabulated in
Appendix F.


Project Traffic Volumes
The Phase 1 and 2 diversion of traffic due to the planned improvements was added to Near Term No
Project traffic volumes to obtain project traffic volumes. The project traffic volumes for Phase 1 and

Phase 2 are shown graphically on Figures 6 and 7. Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are
tabulated in Appendix C.


Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis there are two sets
of relevant criteria for impacts on intersections and freeways. These are based on: (1) the City of Milpitas
and intersection Level of Service standards and (2) the CMP intersection Level of Service standards.

The project is said to create a significant adverse LOS impact on traffic conditions at an intersection in the
City of Milpitas if for either peak hour:

    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under Near
       Term No Project conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under project conditions, or

    2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under Near Term No
       Project conditions and the proposed improvement projects causes both the critical-movement
       delay at the intersection to increase by four or more seconds and the demand-to-capacity ratio
       (V/C) to increase by .01 or more.

An exception to this rule applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average
stopped delay for critical movements (i.e. the change in average stopped delay for critical movements is
negative). In this case, the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by .01 or more.

A significant impact by the City of Milpitas standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures
are implemented that would restore intersection level of service to Near Term No Project conditions or
better.

The definition of a significant impact at a CMP intersection is the same as for the City of Milpitas, except
that the CMP standard for acceptable level of service at a CMP intersection is LOS E or better. A
significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore intersection conditions to Near Term No Project conditions or better.


Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis under Phase 1 and 2 project conditions are summarized in
Table 6. Under both Phase 1 and 2 project conditions, the results show that the following study
intersections would operate at an unacceptable LOS measured against the City of Milpitas and CMP level
of service guidelines during at least one of the peak hours of traffic:

        Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard ­ LOS F, PM peak hour
        Milpitas Boulevard and Calaveras Boulevard ­ LOS F, AM peak hour

The intersection of Milpitas Boulevard and Calaveras Boulevard is projected to degrade to LOS F during
the AM peak hour with or without the proposed improvement projects. This intersection experiences a
large increase in traffic in the future due to already approved development projects and the buildout of the
Midtown Specific Plan. The four proposed improvement projects would have little effect on operations of
this intersection. In the future, the City is planning to widen Calaveras Boulevard to six lanes between
Milpitas Boulevard and Abel Street. Operational improvements are also planned for intersections on
Calaveras Boulevard between I-680 and I-880. The City is currently developing conceptual plans for
these improvements and methods to finance the construction. It is believed that the implementation of
these improvements will return the LOS at the intersection of Milpitas Boulevard/Calaveras Boulevard to
acceptable levels.

The intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard is projected to degrade from LOS E under no
project conditions to LOS F under Phase 1 and Phase 2 conditions during the PM peak hour. Most of the
delay is added as a result of the on-ramp closure. Phase 1 of the project (on-ramp closure) would add 15.9
seconds of average delay during the PM peak hour (94.1 seconds ­ 78.2 seconds). This is primarily due
to the fact that traffic using the eastbound on-ramp to Calaveras Boulevard must divert to the intersection
of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard. Phase 2 of the project (on-ramp closure and off-ramp open)
would add an additional 3.5 seconds of average delay during the PM peak hour (97.6 seconds ­ 94.1
seconds). The additional delay occurs because the new off-ramp draws additional eastbound traffic on
Calaveras Boulevard, which is the peak direction during the PM commute hour, through the intersection
of Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard. During the AM commute hours, the effects of both Phases 1 and 2 on
intersection operations at Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard would be minimal.

All of the remaining study intersections would operate at acceptable levels. The level of service
calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.


    Significant Impact: The intersection of Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard would operate at LOS E
    under Near Term No Project conditions during the PM peak hour. Under Phase 1 and 2 project
    conditions it would degrade to LOS F. According to the CMP guidelines, this would constitute a
    significant impact.

    Mitigation: The 2030 Valley Transportation Plan (VTP) includes a range of highway and transit
    improvement projects to ease existing and future traffic congestion along major travel corridors in
    Santa Clara County. The widening of Calaveras Boulevard, between Milpitas Boulevard and Abel
    Street, is the highest priority project under the Street and Local Roads category and at least 80% of
    the necessary project funding may be secured from federal sources as part of the VTP. To mitigate the
    significant impact, as part of the widening of Calaveras widening project, the following would be
    required:

    ·   Add one additional westbound left turn lane on Calaveras Boulevard (for a total of 2 left turn
        lanes), and
    ·   Restripe the northbound approach on Abel Street from a two through lanes and one right turn lane
        to one through lane, one shared right/through lane, and one right turn lane. This may require
        modifications to the crosswalks at the intersection.

    The implementation of this mitigation would return the LOS to E during the PM peak hour.
    However, the implementation of these improvements may have secondary affects that result in
    additional undesirable impacts. The addition of a second right turn lane northbound on Abel Street
    could result in safety issues for pedestrians in the adjacent crosswalk. While removal of the crosswalk
    would eliminate the potential safety issue, crosswalk removal would decrease pedestrian mobility in

    additional westbound left turn lane on Calaveras Boulevard results in alignment issues with the
    Calaveras Blvd PSR and additional right-of-way on Calaveras Boulevard. Furthermore, this
    improvement is not likely feasible without the widening of Calaveras Boulevard bridge between Abel
    Street and Milpitas Boulevard, which may not occur for many years. Considering all these issues, the
    City of Milpitas has decided that the Phase 1 and 2 impacts at Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard
    should be considered significant and unavoidable. Because Abel Street/Calaveras Boulevard is
    designated as a CMP intersection, and the intersection is subject to regional monitoring, the City of
    Milpitas has opted to prepare a deficiency plan to offset the significant and unavoidable impacts at
    this location.


Signal Warrant Analysis

The peak-hour signal warrant was checked for the unsignalized intersections of Main Street/Calaveras
Boulevard Ramp and Main Street/Carlo Street Ramp to determine whether signalization would be
justified on the basis of project peak-hour volumes. The analysis showed that the peak hour volume signal
warrant is not satisfied under Phase 1 or Phase 2 project conditions at any of the intersections (see Table
7). However, this is just one of eleven possible signal warrants checks. The signal warrant analysis sheets
are included in Appendix E.



Bicycle Impacts
The proposed improvement projects would not result in the removal of any bike lanes, materially change
roadway conditions for bike travel, nor change the demand for bike facilities in the Midtown area. For
these reasons, the impacts on bicycle travel would be less than significant.


Transit Impacts
The proposed improvement projects would not change the demand for transit facilities, modify transit
stops, nor modify routes for buses in the Midtown area (buses do not use the Carlo Street On-Ramp to
Calaveras Boulevard). For these reasons, the impacts on transit travel would be less than significant.


Pedestrian Impacts
The proposed improvement projects would not change the demand for pedestrian facilities nor materially
change roadway conditions for pedestrian travel in the Midtown area. For these reasons, the impacts on
pedestrian travel would be less than significant.

Year 2030 Conditions
This chapter presents a summary of the traffic conditions that would occur under year 2030 conditions
with the proposed improvement projects (hereafter referred to as Project 2030). The analysis of 2030
project conditions was conducted based on projected roadway link volumes using year 2030 land use
data. AM and PM peak hour volumes were developed using the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)
Congestion Management Program (CMP) year 2030 Travel Demand Forecast (TDF) model. All traffic
volumes for year 2030 were supplied by the McCarthy Ranch R&D Traffic Impact Analysis dated
September 25, 2007. To determine project impacts, year 2030 traffic conditions without the proposed
projects (hereafter referred to as No Project 2030) were compared to traffic conditions with proposed
improvement projects (Project 2030). Unlike the near-term analysis described in the previous chapter, the
analysis of 2030 conditions was conducted only for the full build out of the four proposed improvement
projects (Phase 2 only). Phase 1 (onramp closure only) represents an interim condition likely to occur
during construction of the new off-ramp. It would be completed well in advance of 2030.


Project Impact Criteria
For cumulative conditions, the traffic operations at the study segments were evaluated based on the
volume-to-capacity ratio, which can be correlated to a level of service. Under year 2030 conditions, a
project is said to adversely impact a roadway segment if:

    ·   The roadway segment is projected to operate below its LOS standard under No Project 2030 and
        the proposed project is projected to cause an increase in traffic of at least one percent of its
        capacity. Or

    ·   The roadway segment is projected to operate at or better than its LOS standard under No Project
        2030 and the proposed project is expected to degrade the level of service to less than acceptable
        levels.

On roadway segments under year 2030 conditions, a project is said to benefit a roadway segment if:

    ·   The roadway segment is projected to operate below its LOS standard under No Project 2030 and
        the proposed project is expected to cause a decrease in traffic of at least one percent of its
        capacity.

For CMP roadway segments, the minimum acceptable level of service is LOS E. At roadway segments in
Milpitas that are not CMP roadway segments, the minimum acceptable level of service is LOS D.
Calaveras Boulevard, Montague Expressway, I-880, and SR 237 are the only CMP roadways analyzed for
this study.


2030 Network Assumptions
The year 2030 network assumptions under project and no project conditions are described below.

No Project 2030

The year 2030 roadway network for the no project scenario includes planned transportation
improvements. The improvements included in the VTA CMP TDF model have a high probability of
receiving funding in the future. Within the study area, the following improvements were included:

    ·   I-880 Widening Projects. I-880 will be widened to include a high occupancy vehicle lane and
        auxiliary lane in each direction from Montague Expressway north into Alameda County.

    ·   Fremont Boulevard Extension to Dixon Landing Road. Fremont Boulevard will be extended
        southward from its current terminus near Lakeview Drive to Dixon Landing Road. The Fremont
        Boulevard extension will include two lanes in each direction and will form the forth leg of the
        McCarthy Boulevard/Dixon Landing Road intersection. The Fremont Boulevard Extension is a
        City of Fremont (developer funded) project and will occur when the King-Lyon property
        develops.

    ·   Calaveras Boulevard. Calaveras Boulevard will be widened to six lanes between Milpitas
        Boulevard and Abel Street. Operational improvements are also planned for intersections on
        Calaveras Boulevard between I-680 and I-880.

    ·   Montague Expressway. Montague Expressway will be widened to provide eight lanes between
        Great Mall Parkway and I-880. The intersection of Montague Expressway and Great Mall
        Parkway is planned for grade separation.

Planned improvements outside the study area are described in the VTA Valley Transportation Plan 2030,
which is on file with the City of Milpitas. It should be noted that some VTP 2030 projects in the City of
Milpitas have been identified for VTP 2030 funding. However, the City is still responsible for the 20
percent local match. Therefore, additional monetary contributions for these projects are necessary.

Project 2030

The Project 2030 scenario includes all of the improvements described in the No Project 2030 scenario,
but also would result in further modifications to the roadway network (see Chapter 1 for a complete
description of improvements). However, the scale of the improvements would not materially change the

Milpitas Midtown Improvement Plans TIA                                                                 28
overall capacity of the subject roadways given the methods used in the City's 2030 analysis. The City's
year 2030 methods are primarily focussed on corridor capacity, rather than intersection operations
capacity. The City's method for year 2030 analysis considers the number of through lanes on a roadway,
and reduces the capacity of each through lane to account for conflicting movements at intersections.

For the proposed improvements to the Carlo Street ramp at Calaveras Boulevard, the principle effect
would be the diversion of traffic. Impacts to the capacity of Main Street and Calaveras Boulevard would
be insignificant. At the intersection of Abel Street and Calaveras Boulevard, the removal of the planned
second eastbound left turn lane and the introduction of a southbound right turn overlap phase are
primarily operational improvements for turn movements. Although these will affect intersection capacity
at certain times of the day (depending on what movements are critical), the overall scale of improvements
is not large enough to change the capacity of the Calaveras Boulevard corridor. For the proposed lane
reduction on Main Street between Great Mall Parkway and Abel Street, the proposed reduction would not
reduce the number of approach lanes at the signalized intersections below two and would maintain
adequate length for the approach lanes as needed to not adversely affect intersection operations. Thus,
even though between the intersections the number of through lanes would be reduced from four to two, in
the sections of Main Street that determine the segment's corridor capacity, a minimum of two approach
lanes would be maintained, effectively keeping the capacity of the segment unchanged.


Year 2030 Traffic Volumes
All traffic volumes for the No Project 2030 scenario were supplied by the McCarthy Ranch R&D TIA
dated September 25, 2007. Traffic volumes for the Project 2030 scenario were estimated by adding to the
No Project 2030 volumes, the diversion created by the proposed improvement projects. The methods used
to determine the project traffic diversion are described in Chapter 4.


Year 2030 Traffic Analysis
Project conditions were evaluated relative to No Project 2030 in order to determine potential impacts. The
impacts of the proposed project are summarized on Tables 8 through 11. Each table shows the study
roadway segments, the 2030 peak hour volumes for the No Project and Project, the volume-to-capacity
ratio, the level of service, and whether the proposed project adversely impacts the roadways based on the
aforementioned impact criteria. Table 8 presents the results of the northbound and eastbound roadway
segments analysis for the AM peak hour. Table 9 presents the results of the southbound and westbound
roadway segments analysis for the AM peak hour. Table 10 presents the results of the northbound and
eastbound roadway segments analysis for the PM peak hour. Table 11 presents the results of the
southbound and westbound roadway segments analysis for the PM peak hour.

As expected, many of the roadway segments would operate a LOS E or F by the year 2030. Even though
the 2030 roadway network assumes several major roadway capacity improvements, the anticipated
growth in jobs and housing would cause the traffic to increase substantially and cause increased
congestion on the transportation system.

The proposed improvement projects would have a beneficial significant impact on the following roadway
segments in both the AM and PM Peak Hour:

    ·   Main Street (southbound), between Calaveras Boulevard Ramp and Carlo Street Ramp (AM Peak)
    ·   Main Street (northbound), between Carlo Street Ramp and Curtis Avenue (PM Peak)


Hexagon Transportation Consultants, Inc.
Milpitas Midtown Improvement Plans TIA                                                                 29
    ·   Main Street (southbound), between Calaveras Boulevard Ramp and Carlo Street Ramp (PM Peak)

The proposed improvement projects would have an adverse significant impact the following roadway
segments in both the AM and PM peak hours:

    ·   Abel Street (southbound), between Milpitas Boulevard and Calaveras Boulevard (AM Peak)
    ·   Abel Street (northbound), between Calaveras Boulevard and Great Mall Parkway (PM Peak)
    ·   Main Street (northbound), between Weller Lane and Calaveras Boulevard Ramp (PM Peak)
    ·   Main Street (northbound), between Calaveras Boulevard Ramp and Carlo Street Ramp (PM Peak)

    Significant Impact: Abel Street southbound between Milpitas Boulevard and Calaveras Boulevard
    would operate at LOS F under No Project 2030 conditions during the AM peak hour. The Carlo Street
    ramp conversion would add traffic in the amount of 2% of capacity to this segment. According to the
    Milpitas significance criteria, this would constitute a significant impact. The significant impacts on
    Abel Street between Milpitas Boulevard and Calaveras Boulevard occur immediately around the
    intersection of Calaveras Boulevard at Abel Street. Thus, the improvements to this intersection would
    effectively mitigate the impacts of the Carlo Street ramp diversion. However, as previously described,
    for various reasons, the City has considered these improvements infeasible and considers the impacts
    on this segment to be significant and unavoidable.

    Significant Impact: Abel Street northbound between Calaveras Boulevard and Great Mall Parkway
    would operate at LOS E under No Project 2030 conditions during the PM peak hour. The Carlo Street
    ramp conversion would add traffic in the amount of 13% of capacity to this segment. According to
    the Milpitas significance criteria, this would constitute a significant impact. The significant impacts
    on Abel Street between Great Mall Parkway and Calaveras Boulevard occur immediately around the
    intersection of Calaveras Boulevard at Abel Street. Thus, the improvements to this intersection would
    effectively mitigate the impacts of the Carlo Street ramp diversion. However, as previously described,
    for various reasons, the City has considered these improvements infeasible and considers the impacts
    on this segment to be significant and unavoidable.

    Significant Impact: Main Street northbound between Weller Lane and Calaveras Boulevard Ramp
    would operate at LOS F under No Project 2030 conditions during the PM peak hour. The Carlo Street
    ramp conversion would add traffic in the amount of 2.8% of capacity to this segment. According to
    the Milpitas significance criteria, this would constitute a significant impact. Mitigation of significant
    project impacts on these segments of Main Street would require roadway widening to construct
    additional through lanes, thereby increasing roadway capacity. However, widening is not consistent
    with the City's North Main Street Streetscape Project, which is currently under construction and is
    intended to create a more walkable environment. Therefore, the significant impacts on this segment
    should be considered significant and unavoidable.

    Significant Impact: Main Street northbound between Calaveras Boulevard Ramp and Carlo
    Street Ramp would operate at LOS F under No Project 2030 conditions during the PM peak hour.
    The Carlo Street ramp conversion would add traffic in the amount of 2.1% of capacity to this
    segment. According to the Milpitas significance criteria, this would constitute a significant
    impact. Mitigation of significant project impacts on these segments of Main Street would require
    roadway widening to construct additional through lanes, thereby increasing roadway capacity.
    However, widening is not consistent with the City's North Main Street Streetscape Project, which
    is currently under construction and is intended to create a more walkable environment. Therefore,
    the significant impacts on this segment should be considered significant and unavoidable.

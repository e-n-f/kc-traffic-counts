   Executive Summary
   NOTE:
   The Metropolitan Topeka Planning Organization Policy Board voted to "receive" this Plan                       provides current land owners and potential developers with a framework from which to evaluate
   without endorsing any of the illustrated backage road or access closure concepts. The Policy                  future growth and development opportunities based on an improved transportation system and
   Board thinks further discussions with users of the corridor; additional public comment;                       approved land use concepts. Similarly, it provides stakeholder agencies with a mechanism to begin

   Policy Board supports KDOT's efforts to contract with a consultant for a Phase II Highway 24
   Corridor study.                                                                                               The study area encompassed US-24 and adjacent land uses from Huxman Road on the west, to

    interchange location at Topeka Boulevard and US-24 was noted as an important element in the
    future concepts. Several comments regarding replacement of the interchange, the proposed KDOT
    roundabout alternative, and standard at-grade intersection control were received during public
    meetings and on project surveys. Additional operational analyses were conducted for alternative
    traffic control options at this junction. Ultimately, an at-grade intersection option was recommended
    by the study team.

    In addition to the Topeka Boulevard location, several recommendations regarding circulation
    improvements along the corridor were finalized. These included a new 25th Street extension, and
    several service road locations to replace the current frontage road system that contributes to many
    of the access deficiencies today. The recommendations coincide with several redevelopment
    opportunities highlighted in the land use planning tasks and provide for improved long-term
    aesthetics, pedestrian activity, and transit options within the study area.

    1.2 Project Approach

    The approach to the US-24 Access Management, Circulation, and Land Use Plan was data driven
    in the collection of technical information and also the gathering of local stakeholder information
    through public involvement. Most aspects of this plan are based on the reciprocal relationship
    between land use and transportation. A large focus was placed on realistic future land use
    assumptions that would guide needed transportation improvements. In turn, those transportation
    alternatives help provide guidance on where
    specific land use types are best located in the
    future so that safe and efficient operations of
    the surrounding roadway network can be
    realized.

    Through the analysis of alternatives and
    gathering of stakeholder feedback, the on-
    going refinement of both land use and
    transportation improvements was completed.
    As part of the plan, several tasks were conducted to provide a summary of existing conditions along

    To fully understand the transportation elements of the study area, a detailed review and analysis of   Traffic operations in the proposed project vicinity were analyzed using procedures described in the
    existing transportation conditions was conducted. As part of this task, a number of key traffic and    Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2000). The efficiency of traffic operations is measured in terms of

    Upon the assembly and review of existing information, a drive-through field review was conducted
    of US-24, and several other segments including: Tyler Street, Rochester Road, Topeka Boulevard,
    Kansas Avenue, Lyman Road, Menninger Road, and other supplemental study area roadways.
    Several roadway segments and intersection characteristics were reviewed, in addition to general
    study area roadway continuity and circulation patterns. Key network segments included in the
    travel demand model were reviewed for consistency in number of lanes, speed limits, and
    capacities. The US-24 corridor was reviewed to also denote access locations, spacing of access
    points and any typical deficiencies noted with private driveways or frontage road operations. As
    part of the field review, several digital photos were collected and field notes were documented on
    aerial mapping of the study area. Speed limits, average daily traffic volumes, and access point
    locations are illustrated on Figure 3.1 through Figure 3.5. Existing average daily traffic (24-hour)
    volumes were obtained from KDOT.


    3.2 Data Collection

    Traffic volume information was also assembled for the study corridor to assist in the review of
    existing operations. To supplement existing information, peak hour (7 - 9 am and 4 - 6 pm)
    intersection turning movement volumes were collected (February/March 2008) by Iteris and City of
    Topeka staff at the following intersections:

             US Highway 24 and Tyler St/Rochester Rd
             US Highway 24 and Topeka Blvd

    As illustrated in the previous Figures 3.1 through Figure 3.6, capacity analyses were conducted to         East Central Area: To the east of the Goodyear Road interchange, the frontage roads stop and

    roadway segments and at select study area intersections. Segment level capacity analyses were              a higher mix of commercial and retail activity, lower speed traffic and signalized intersections. In

    weave segment analyses were performed using HCS for the US-24 and Topeka Boulevard                         24 with Rochester and Kansas Avenue. Multiple access drives are provided in this area, including
    interchange area.       Intersection capacity analyses were conducted for standard, at-grade               one located off of the northbound to eastbound US-24 on ramp as illustrated in Figure 3.7.
    intersections with signalized and unsignalized traffic control using Synchro, version 7.0, which is
    based on the HCM delay methodology.

    Based on the results of the analyses, most all of the US-24 roadway segments and study area
    intersections have adequate operations during peak hour periods. Specific left-turn movements at
    select signalized intersections experience higher delays during brief cycles of the peak period. This
    is primarily due to the larger turn movements both to and from the commercial areas adjacent US-
    24 at Tyler/Rochester, Topeka Boulevard, and Kansas Avenue. In addition, turning traffic at
    multiple commercial access driveways in this same vicinity adds to the delays and vehicle queuing.
    The existing interchange operations at the US-24 and Topeka Boulevard junction were also shown
    to be adequate based on the analysis software, however, field review of this location noted
    increased vehicle conflicts during peak periods due the minimal on/off ramp acceleration and
    deceleration lengths. The decreased availability of gaps in the mainline traffic during peak
    operations promoted on-ramp vehicle braking and increased difference in relative speeds among
    vehicles within the operational area of the interchange.


    3.4 Circulation Analysis

    Upon completion of the initial field review and analysis, a series of general observations, were                                                              Commercial Access

    transit modes is included in the Context Sensitive Design section of this report. A summary of this
    information is condensed by the US-24 sub areas and highlighted below:

    West Area: On the west end of the US-24 corridor, near Huxman Road, there are several private
    driveways to homes and businesses with direct access to the highway. There is a lack of turn lanes
    in this higher speed, two-lane section of US-24 through this area at both public road and private
    drive locations. These characteristic carry through the Menoken Road intersection to the east.                             Figure 3.7 US-24 Eastbound On-Ramp From Topeka Boulevard

    As illustrated in Table 3.2 above, the largest concentration of crashes occur in the segment from
    Rochester to Meriden. This segment is characterized by access management deficiencies
    including lack of turn lanes, closely-spaced driveway locations, and poor spacing between US-24
    and frontage road intersections. Individual intersection crash rates are illustrated in Table 3.3. As
    expected, the intersections located within the higher rate segments also contained the highest
    number of individual crashes. It is interesting to note that even though the junction of Topeka
    Boulevard is grade-separated, over half of the crashes were of the rear end type, confirming field
    observations with vehicle braking due to the lack of adequate accel/decel tapers for the ramp areas.


    3.6 Travel Demand Modeling

    As part of the study effort, the Iteris project team was provided the most recent TransCAD travel
    demand model for use on the project. Travel demand modeling was a major component of the
    project and provided a means to further analyze trends in traffic growth and test roadway network
    alternatives. A base year (2004) model was provided and assumed to be calibrated and validated                                   Figure 3.9: US-24 Existing Model Volumes (2)

             History of the area
             All transportation modes including vehicles, pedestrian, transit, and bicycles

    Context sensitive design of roadways should reflect community values and add lasting value to the

    The study team has pursued an integrated approach to land use and transportation analysis for this
    plan. The Iteris project team held numerous discussions regarding the transportation needs that
    would fit with certain land uses and how land use may change with transportation changes. There
    were three major outputs of the land use analysis that relate specifically to the transportation
    analysis.

    1. Travel Demand Model Input: Both land use scenarios helped feed the travel demand model for
       future transportation needs in the Study Area. The Study Team developed population,
       household, and employment projections for the land use scenarios and adjusted the traffic
       analysis zones in the travel demand model to better reflect the proposed land use changes. As
       a result the traffic volumes forecast for US-24 and adjacent local roads are reflective of the land
       use forecasts.

    2. Need for Service Roads at Key Locations: Several of the recommendations from the land use
       analysis support the need for expansion of connections and service roads at key locations in the
       study area. The following are locations where these facilities would help support future land
       use:

             Improved access through more continuous frontage or service roads between US-75 and
             the access to the Goodyear Plant would support the existing and desired industrial
             developments in this area.
             Enhanced connectivity between the Goodyear Plant and Rochester Road via roadway
             connections would enhance access and support further development in this area where
             potential office park use has been identified.

    2034 Land Use Scenario 1:
    Based on previous future land use alternatives developed by the project team, the model network
    was modified to evaluate Land Use Scenario 1, which was developed in accordance with existing
    City and County zoning regulations. In order to update the model to reflect the land use scenario,
    several Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) within the study area had to be split, which resulted in 11 new
    TAZs. Splitting the TAZ also required the addition of centroid connectors to the new TAZs, which
    were connected to the travel demand model roadway network consistent with the existing study
    area roadway network. Once the roadway network changes were complete the Socio-Economic
    Data in the model was updated to reflect the land use plan and the model was ran to evaluate the
    impact on the future roadway network. Traffic volume forecasts from this scenario were plotted and
    are illustrated in Figure 8.1 below.

    8.2 Traffic Operations Analysis

    Due to the overwhelming discussion regarding the future status of the US-24 and Topeka
    Boulevard interchange, additional operational analyses were conducted for the corridor to evaluate
    expected peak hour operations at this location, and impacts to adjacent intersections. Several
    stakeholder comments and public involvement survey information indicated that the interchange
    location was a focal point of the study and potential transportation improvement alternatives should
    be carefully evaluated. The Iteris project team developed additional peak hour traffic projections
    based on year 2034 Land Use Scenario 2 forecasts. These traffic projections were then analyzed
    for multiple, alternatives in terms of traffic control. The options analyzed included the current,
    functionally obsolete interchange, a standard diamond interchange, an at-grade signalized
    intersection, and an at-grade roundabout intersection.

    The peak hour traffic volume forecasts and operational analyses results for each of the US-24 and
    Topeka Boulevard alternatives is illustrated in Figure 8.4 and Figure 8.5.
                                                                                                             Figure 8.5: 2034 Peak Hour LOS at US-24 and Topeka

    The previous KDOT multi-lane roundabout concepts were also re-visited for the intersection.
    Analyses results indicate that a basic, two-lane roundabout will serve traffic for several years into
    the future. To facilitate ultimate year 2034 traffic forecasts, however, several geometric additions
    would be necessary to the roundabout including a third lane in the east/west approaches and
    separate, right-turn fly-by lanes. This was presented in previous KDOT studies and concepts for
    the intersection. The analyses results in Figure 8.5 depict a basic two-lane roundabout as the
    project team felt the ultimate configuration was somewhat a-typical. Discussions with agency
    partners and the public also indicated concern regarding driver familiarity and acceptance with this
    complex roundabout concept.

    An at-grade signalized intersection was also evaluated for this location and is expected to serve
    traffic well into the future. The intersection analyses assumed geometric improvements including
    dual left-turns when warranted, and exclusive right-turn lanes on each approach. LOS results at
    specific individual movements would experience some increased delays during peak hour
    operations (left-turns); however, overall intersection operations indicated LOS D or better for year
    2034 projections. A request for additional analyses and impacts to adjacent intersections was
    requested by City of Topeka and KDOT staff. In response, the Iteris project team conducted
    planning level operational analyses of adjacent intersections and provided simulation of these
    operations as part of public information displays. A sample snapshot of this is illustrated in Figure
    8.6.

US-24 Corridor



        Pedestrian / Bicycle Needs: With long term development and changes in both land use
        and transportation characteristics, there will be multiple opportunities to improve the
        pedestrian and bicycle facilities within the corridor. The LRTP already contains useful
        guidance on these facilities. In addition, sidewalk and trail extensions should be included
        where feasible along many of the service road and future collector roadway extensions
        that are identified in the recommendations. This will provide for improved character of
        these facilities and allow better access to development options.

        Transit: In similar fashion to providing pedestrian connectivity, future transit opportunities
        exist within the corridor as well. The service road locations that could provide access to
        development on both sides of their alignment are important locations to provide transit as it
        is anticipated that employment uses and primary destinations would be located within
        these segments. Options for east/west transit routes along these improved connections
        could be more easily managed than along US-24. Detailed transit analysis was not
        conducted as part of this project. Additional analysis of transit improvements, including
        transit routes and the potential for transfer centers and park and ride facilities should be
        conducted as transportation and roadway improvements implementation strategies are
        developed as part of future planning studies for the US 24 corridor.

      These items are discussed further in Section 10.3

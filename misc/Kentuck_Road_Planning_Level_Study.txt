Executive Summary

Dewberry Engineers Inc. (Dewberry) and Ramey Kemp & Associates Inc. (RKA) have completed the
Kentuck Road (Route 729) improvements study for the West Piedmont Planning District Commission
(WPPDC) and the Danville Pittsylvania Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) in cooperation with
the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), the City of Danville, and Pittsylvania County. The
intent of this study is to define the most advantageous locations for spot improvements along Kentuck
Road between the intersections with South Boston Road (US 58) and Little Creek Road (Route 732), as
well as to examine improvements to the existing signalized intersection at South Boston Road. Below is
a summary of the conclusions and recommendations from this study.

   1. Based on the analysis within this report, it is expected that due to the expected growth of this
      area and the existing crash rates, improvements to the existing roadway and associated
      intersections should be identified.

   2. To deal with these deficiencies, three (3) locations for spot improvements have been identified.
      For each location different improvement alternatives were identified. The locations and
      associated improvements are listed below:
      a. The intersection of Kentuck Road and Halifax Road.
           i. Addition of a 200 foot left turn lane on the northbound approach and a 100 foot left
              turn lane on the southbound approach.
          ii. Addition of 100 foot left turn lanes on the northbound and southbound approaches as
              well as the installation of a traffic signal.
         iii. Construction of a single lane roundabout with widened approaches of each leg.
      b. The intersection of Kentuck Road and Eagle Springs Road.
           i. Addition of a 100 foot right turn lane on the northbound approach.
          ii. Remove northbound channelization and install right turn on the northbound and
              westbound approaches.
      c. The intersection of Kentuck Road and Little Creek / Fall Creek Road.
           i. Construction of a center-turn lane on Kentuck Road between Fall Creek Road and Little
              Creek Road in addition to the construction of a 150 foot right turn lane on the
              eastbound approach and extension of the right turn lane on the southbound approach
              to provide 100 feet of storage.
          ii. Shifting the alignments of Little Creek Road and Fall Creek Road, the installation of a
              traffic signal, the construction of 100 foot left turn lanes on the northbound and
              southbound approaches, and a 100 foot left turn lane on the eastbound approach will
              be constructed.
         iii. Shifting the alignments of Little Creek Road and Fall Creek Road and the construction of
              a single lane roundabout with widened approaches.

   3. The alternatives for each location were evaluated using eight (8) criteria to determine the
      preferred alternative for the three spot improvements. The recommended spot improvements
      are listed below for each location.

FINAL REPORT                                                   Kentuck Road - Planning Level Study



    a. Location 1: The construction of a single lane roundabout with widened approaches of each
       leg based upon the current data.
       Note: As the time for implementation of this improvement approaches, the signal warrants
       should be reanalyzed. If a signal is warranted, the signalized intersection with the addition
       of 100 foot left turn lanes on the northbound and southbound approaches is the
       recommended alternative.
    b. Location 2: Remove northbound channelization and install right turn on the northbound
       and westbound approaches.
    c. Location 3: Shifting the alignments of Little Creek Road and Fall Creek Road, the installation
       of a traffic signal, the construction of 100 foot left turn lanes on the northbound and
       southbound approaches, and a 100 foot right turn lane on the eastbound approach will be
       included.

4. Through the implementation of these improvements, this segment of Kentuck Road will operate
   under capacity and with increased safety.

                             KENTUCK ROAD ­ PLANNING LEVEL STUDY
I. INTRODUCTION
Dewberry Engineers Inc. (Dewberry) and Ramey Kemp & Associates Inc. (RKA) have completed the
Kentuck Road (Route 729) improvements study for the West Piedmont Planning District Commission
(WPPDC) and the Danville Pittsylvania Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) in cooperation with
the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), the City of Danville, and Pittsylvania County. The
intent of this study is to define the most advantageous locations for spot improvements along
Kentuck Road between the intersections with South Boston Road (US 58) and Little Creek Road
(Route 732), as well as examine improvements to the existing signalized intersection at South Boston
Road.

This section of Kentuck Road is divided at the intersection of Wilkerson Road (Route 730), where
Pittsylvania County is to the north and the City of Danville is to the south. See Figure 1 for the locations
of Kentuck Road and the limits of the analysis. The section within the City of Danville between the
intersections with South Boston Road and Wilkerson Road was identified for improvement within the
Year 2035 Long Range Transportation Plan. The proposed improvements, listed within the Roadway
Vision Plan, were to widen the existing road to four lanes, matching the proposed R4D typical section.
Such projects listed within the Transportation Vision Plan were indicated as having a lesser priority as
funding is not available based on the Expected Funding Stream. For the purposes of this study, it is
anticipated that Kentuck Road will remain a two-lane rural roadway.

Also noted in Figure 1 is the approximate location of the potential alignment of the Route 730
Connector Road. The preferred alignment, as shown in the Route 730 to Route 29 Connector Study,
connects Route 29 to Kentuck Road and intersects with Kentuck Road between the Ringgold Industrial
Parkway and Little Creek Road. In addition, turn lanes along Kentuck Road will be required at this
intersection, which should be analyzed upon further development of the Connector Road. This potential
alignment has been shown on the figure, but for purposes of this planning level study, its impacts have
not been included in the analysis.

This study will provide the WPPDC, the MPO, and local governments with a planning level document
detailing multiple alternatives for improving the safety and capacity of Kentuck Road for the Year 2035.
In order to determine these alternatives, the following is addressed within this study:
    1.   Identification of the Existing Conditions;
    2.   Discussion of Possible Environmental Constraints;
    3.   Review of Existing Traffic Safety;
    4.   Analysis of the No-Build Alternative;
    5.   Statement of Purpose and Need;
    6.   Improvement Alternatives
From the improvement alternatives developed within this report, one preferred alternative will be
recommended for future design and construction.

II. EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
A description of each existing road within the study area is listed below.

Kentuck Road (Route 729) is classified as an Urban Minor Arterial within the Danville City limits and as a
Rural Major Collector within Pittsylvania County. The posted speed limit along this road is 45 miles per
hour (MPH). The typical road section includes two 11-foot lanes with no shoulders. The horizontal and
vertical alignments follow the natural terrain with limited to no passing zones.

South Boston Road (US 58) is classified as an Urban Principal Arterial with a posted speed limit of
45 MPH. This road serves as the primary route between Danville and South Boston. The typical road
section includes a four-lane divided roadway (two lanes in each direction) with lane widths of 12 feet.
The horizontal alignment is primarily straight with subtle horizontal curves. The vertical alignment
generally approximates the adjacent rolling terrain.

Halifax Road (Route 655) is a two-lane rural road with a posted speed limit of 45 MPH. The typical road
section includes two 10-foot-wide lanes; and the shoulders along this road are limited. The horizontal
alignment follows a winding path with multiple horizontal curves.

Wilkerson Road (Route 730) is classified as an Urban Collector with a posted speed limit of 45 MPH.
This road serves as an east-west route for local traffic. The typical road section includes 11-foot-wide
lanes. The horizontal alignment follows the natural terrain with a rolling vertical alignment.

Fall Creek Road is a two-lane rural road with a posted speed limit of 45 MPH. This road serves as an
east-west route for local traffic in this area. The typical road section includes 10-foot lanes with limited
or no shoulder. The horizontal and vertical alignments follow the natural terrain with limited to no
passing zones.

Little Creek Road (Route 732) is classified as a Rural Major Collector with a posted speed limit of 45
MPH. The typical road section includes 11-foot lanes with limited or no shoulder. This road serves as an
east-west route for local traffic to the City of Danville.

Existing Roadway Volumes and Level of Service

To determine the peak hour volumes within the study area, on February 6 and 7, 2013, Ramey Kemp &
Associates conducted turning movement counts for the AM and PM peak periods. These are included in
Appendix A for reference. A review of the traffic counts indicates the AM and PM peak hours occurred
at different times at each intersection. It should be noted that for the purpose of this study, the peak
hour volumes at each intersection were assumed to occur simultaneously. The turning movement
counts were taken at the following intersections:

    1.   Kentuck Road and South Boston Road
    2.   Kentuck Road and Shopping Center Entrance
    3.   Kentuck Road and Halifax Road
    4.   Kentuck Road and Eagle Springs/Wilkerson Road
    5.   Kentuck Road and Ringgold Industrial Park
    6.   Kentuck Road and Fall Creek Road
    7.   Kentuck Road and Little Creek Road.

The existing intersection geometry and traffic control devices are presented in Figure 2; and the existing
(2013) traffic volumes are presented in Figure 3. Using the existing traffic volumes shown in Figure 3,
the existing levels of service were determined for each intersection.

The levels of service (LOS) for each intersection are shown in Figure 4. As can be seen in this figure, all
approaches currently operate at acceptable LOSs and only the westbound approaches at the
intersections with South Boston Road (Route 58) and Halifax Road operate at LOS C in the p.m. peak
hour. Table 1 below also shows the existing LOSs for each intersection.

The complete level of service analysis for the existing condition is included in Appendix C for reference.

All analysis was performed using the methodologies as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM).
The measurement used to define the performance of an intersection is determined by LOS A through F.
An LOS C or better will be considered an acceptable LOS for this area. See Appendix B for a more
detailed explanation of the methodology and criteria used for the Level of Service analysis.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities

Currently Kentuck Road (Route 729) does not support bicycle or pedestrian traffic along the section
analyzed within this report. This study will consider the accommodations of bicycles and pedestrians
along this section of road to adhere to the Commonwealth Transportation Board's (CTB) policy.

In review of the West Piedmont Regional Bicycle Plan, revised September 2007, Kentuck Road north of
the Danville City Line is indicated as a possible bicycle route connecting to the proposed mixed-use route
along the existing railroad bed leading to the Ringgold Depot Trail. Four possible roadway sections are
shown within this report and are included in Appendix D for reference. When developing the alternative
improvements for this section of roadway, these different typical sections will be included in order to
account for bicycle facilities along Kentuck Road.

Environmental Resources

This section describes the potential environmental resources within the proposed project area. Table 2
summarizes potential environmental issues and recommendations for addressing possible impacts to
those resources. Other environmental resources may exist within the proposed project area that are
not included in the table.

 Cultural Resources         A review of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps and aerial
                            photographs identified a cemetery located approximately 1,500 feet south
                            of Lewis Lane and 200 feet west of Kentuck Road; further review of this
                            resource should be conducted. A review of the Virginia Department of
                            Historic Resources Data Sharing System (VDHR DSS) online database noted
                            no known or mapped resources within the project corridor. The absence of
                            mapped resources does not mean resources are not present in the project
                            corridor; it could be attributable to a lack of survey information. A Phase I
                            survey should be conducted once an alternative is identified.

 Waters of the U.S.,        A review of the National Wetland Inventory GIS online mapper noted no
 including wetlands         known or mapped wetlands within the project corridor. The absence of
                            mapped wetlands does not mean resources are not present on site; a
                            potential cause of the absence could be that a survey was never conducted.
                            A Waters of the U.S. (WOUS)/Wetland delineation should be conducted once
                            an alternative is identified. Three tributaries, Fall Creek and two unnamed
                            tributaries to Cane Creek, are located within the project corridor. One of the
                            tributaries of Fall Creek appears to originate at a culvert outfall under
                            Kentuck Road. Further review of USGS topographic maps and aerial
                            photographs indicate a few areas within the corridor, specifically adjacent to
                            the road that could potentially contain jurisdictional waters/wetlands.

Water Quality Permits     This roadway appears to follow a topographic ridge and as such, only minor
                          drainage crossing and headwater wetland areas exist. Permitting scenarios
                          will vary depending on verification of wetland and stream locations and the
                          location of construction activities. In comparison to similar projects, impacts
                          usually will fit general water quality permits from both the Department of
                          Environmental Quality (DEQ) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

Farmland and Soil         Service (NRCS). However, a portion of the project corridor is classified by the
                          U.S. Census Bureau as urbanized land and prime or state importance
                          farmland does not apply. Urbanized land does not meet all the
                          requirements set forth by governing bodies to be classified as prime or state
                          important farmland. Coordination with NRCS may be necessary when an
                          alternative is identified for areas classified as prime farmland or farmland of
                          statewide importance located outside the urbanized land.

Threatened and            The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service database (IPaC), Virginia Department of
Endangered                Conservation and Recreation, and the Virginia Department of Game and
Species/Wildlife and      Inland Fisheries did not note any mapped observations of Federal
Waterfowl Refuges         Endangered (FE), Federal Threatened (FT), State Endangered (SE) or State
                          Threatened (ST) species within the project corridor. The absence of mapped
                          species observation does not mean FE, FT, SE, or ST species are not present.
                          The absence may be because a survey was never conducted. Additionally,
                          the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not list any designated critical habitat.
                          No wildlife or waterfowl refuges are located within the project corridor. A
                          search of the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR)'s Biotics
                          Data System was submitted and resulted in the project not affecting any
                          documented state-listed threatened plants or insects.

Hazardous Materials       A review of the Environmental Protection Agency "Enviro-mapper" and the
                          Virginia DEQ website "What's in my Backyard" indicates that multiple known
                          hazardous material sites exist within the project limits and are shown on
                          Figure 5. Acquisitions of land that contains hazardous material will require,
                          at a minimum, a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) Report.
                          Multiple Phase I ESA Reports should be anticipated as a result of the past
                          and current use of existing properties and observation of many areas
                          currently being used as trash dump sites. Additionally, acquisition of
                          residential or commercial buildings with lead-based paint and/or asbestos-
                          containing, and/or Recognized Environmental Condition (REC) building
                          materials would be considered an issue for the project and further
                          investigation would be required.

 Resources/Issue           Comments
 FEMA                      There are no FEMA floodplains within the project corridor. An adjacent
                           tributary, Cane Creek, has a FEMA-Mapped Floodplain but does not
                           encroach into the corridor.

 Well and Septic           Well and septic locations within the project corridor are not known at this
                           time. A request for records of locations should be submitted to the health
                           department once an alternative is identified. There is a potential for a
                           complete parcel take if a septic system is required to be removed, and an
                           alternative field and/or public utilities hookup cannot be provided.


Traffic Safety/Crash Data Analysis

Crash data from the most recent 3-year period (2008 to 2010) for the corridor were provided by VDOT.
After review of the data, the results identified three locations along the 2.73-mile-long segment of
Kentuck Road where numerous crashes occurred, which are identified below:

    1. Intersection of Kentuck Road and South Boston Road;
    2. Intersection of Kentuck Road and the Shopping Center Entrance; and
    3. Intersection of Kentuck Road and Halifax Road.

During this period, 48 reported crashes occurred along the study corridor. Of the 48 total reported
crashes, 23 resulted in property damage only (PDO) and 25 involved at least one injury. No fatalities
were reported. The locations of all individual accidents along this section of roadway are shown in
Figure 6. This figure also indicates whether the crash was a PDO or if it resulted in an injury. Figure 7
graphically summarizes the Kentuck Road crash history by year and severity. Appendix F contains the
crash data summary sheet.

As displayed in Figure 7 above, more crashes were reported in 2010 than either 2008 or 2009 and both
years combined. In addition to the crash severity and total number of crashes, the type and location of
accidents were also analyzed. Figure 8 shows the type and severity of the 48 crashes that occurred
between 2008 and 2010.

As displayed in Figure 8 on the previous page, a majority of the crashes were Angle crashes, including
both injury and property damage only cases. Probable causes for the high number of Angle crashes
could be attributed to various factors such as large intersection volumes, restricted sight distance, and
excessive speed on approaches. Potential solutions to these contributing factors worth examining are
installation of signalized intersections, appropriate warning signage, and/or paved shoulders and
roadway widening.

As part of the safety analysis, the Kentuck Road corridor was studied as two segments, and more
specifically at seven intersections. The segments along the corridor include (1) South Boston Road to
the City Limit and (2) the City Limit to Route 732. The segments were created based on the classification
of the roadway. The crash rates for these segments are listed below:

    1. South Boston Road to City Limit: 276.1 per 100 million (100M) vehicle miles traveled
    2. City Limit to Route 732: 145 per 100M vehicle miles traveled

The crash rates per the listed segments along Kentuck Road can be compared to the statewide average
crash rate of 185 per 100M vehicle miles traveled. The majority of the corridor, from South Boston Road
to the City Limit, has a significantly higher crash rate, while the remainder of the corridor from the City
Limit to Route 732 is slightly lower compared to the statewide average. Because of the higher crash rate
along most of the corridor, further consideration to improve existing conditions is necessary.

Intersections were examined based on factors such as the method of traffic control, lane geometry, and
the number of approaches. According to the crash summary data sheet, 15 of the 48 reported accidents
were at existing intersections. Of those 15 accidents, eight occurred at the intersection of Halifax Road
and Kentuck Road. This intersection currently features two-way stop control. Because of the high
number of accidents taking place at this intersection, improvements are required to increase traffic
safety.

III. FUTURE NO-BUILD ALTERNATIVE (YEAR 2035)

Using information obtained from the regional traffic model received from VDOT for this area, Ramey
Kemp & Associates, Inc. projected the future no-build traffic volumes. Through this model, the following
annual growth rates were approximated for the associated movements at the following intersections
based on 2006 and 2035 average daily traffic (ADT) data. If ADT data was not available, or decreased in
the future year, a 1-percent growth rate was assumed.

Intersection of Kentuck Road and South Boston Road
Eastbound through movement on South Boston Road and southbound right-turn movement on
Kentuck Road: 1.0 percent.
All remaining movements on South Boston Road and Kentuck Road: 1.1 percent.

Intersection of Kentuck Road and Shopping Center
All movements on Kentuck Road and Shopping Center: 1.0 percent.

Intersection of Kentuck Road and Halifax Road
All movements on Kentuck Road and Halifax Road: 1.0 percent.

   FINAL REPORT                                                 Kentuck Road - Planning Level Study



Northbound right-turn movement and southbound left-turn movement on Kentuck Road as well as
eastbound through movement and all westbound movements on Halifax Road also included half of the
anticipated traffic that could be generated by a light-industrial site employing 111.

Intersection of Kentuck Road and Eagle Springs Road/Wilkerson Road
All movements on Kentuck Road, Eagle Springs Road, and Wilkerson Road: 1.0 percent.

Intersection of Kentuck Road and Ringgold Industrial Parkway
All movements on Kentuck Road and Ringgold Industrial Parkway: 1.0 percent.

Intersections of Kentuck Road and Little Creek Road and Fall Creek Road
Northbound left-turn movement and southbound right-turn movement on Kentuck Road as well as all
eastbound movements on Little Creek Road and the westbound through movement on Fall Creek Road:
4.0 percent.
All remaining movements on Kentuck Road and Fall Creek Road: 1.0 percent.

From this software, the future no-build traffic volumes were determined as shown in Figure 9. Using
these traffic volumes, the future no-build intersection level of service analysis was completed.

* Please note that the LOSs are reported in accordance with the HCM designations.


The complete LOS analysis for the future no-build condition is included in Appendix G for reference.

The most severe deterioration is forecast to occur at Little Creek Road. Poor service levels are expected
as a result of the increase in predicted traffic volumes along Kentuck Road. Reduced frequency of
adequate gaps between vehicles may increase delays for motorists on secondary street approaches
before they can safely enter the traffic stream. As shown by this analysis, improvements to these
intersections are required if acceptable LOSs are planned for the year 2035.

IV. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND NEED

Considering VDOT Access Management Standards and the results of the analysis of the existing and
future no-build (Year 2035) conditions, the statement of purpose and need for the Kentuck Road
Evaluation of Improvements Study is based on addressing the following issues:
   1. LOSs at intersections, within the study limits, are anticipated to decrease below acceptable
      levels unless improvements are made based on signal warrants and intersection analysis;
   2. Safety and mobility shall be preserved or increased through implementation of identified spot
      improvements; and,
   3. Accommodations for bicycles and pedestrians should be considered along Kentuck Road to
      adhere to the CTB Policy.

The improvement alternatives will be developed to best satisfy the requirements in each of the three
guidelines listed above.
V. IMPROVEMENT ALTERNATIVES
Improvement alternatives to this section of Kentuck Road will be analyzed within this study. Evaluation
criteria were developed to determine which alternative best meets the needs of this section of roadway.
Eight factors were rated by importance on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most important. These
criteria are shown in Table 4 below.

Based on the findings of the future no-build capacity analysis, most intersections will meet adequate
capacity requirements and operate at acceptable LOSs, except for the intersection with Little Creek
Road. In addition to the capacity analysis, the need for auxiliary turn lanes were evaluated using turn
lane warrants contained within Appendix F of the VDOT Roadway Design Manual. Based on the capacity
analysis and turn lane warrants, it was determined that no improvements are needed at the
intersections of South Boston Road, the Shopping Center, and Ringgold Industrial Parkway on
Kentuck Road. A review of the crash data was also completed and many accidents have occurred just
north of the South Boston Intersection and at the intersections of Halifax Road and Eagle Springs Road.
Given the number of accidents that have occurred along Kentuck Road, just north of South Boston Road,
this area should be monitored and if accidents increase or become more severe, measures may need to
be taken to restrict movements, such as constructing channelized islands within driveways, a median
island on Kentuck Road, or even driveway closure. Three locations for alternative spot improvements
have been identified along this corridor and are shown in Figure 11.

These alternative improvements shown in Figure 11 are broken up into three locations. The first area is
at the intersection of Kentuck Road and Halifax Road. The second spot is at the intersection of
Kentuck Road and Eagle Springs Road. The last location is at the intersection of Kentuck Road and
Fall Creek Road/Little Creek Road. Through the implementation of these improvements, the safety and
capacity along this stretch of road will be increased.

Intersection of Kentuck and Halifax Road Improvement Alternatives

As identified on Figure 11, three alternatives for improvements at the intersection of Kentuck Road and
Halifax Road were developed. Alternative 1 consists of the addition of a 200-foot left-turn lane on the
northbound approach and a 100-foot left-turn lane on the southbound approach. Because of the
addition of these turn lanes, Kentuck Road will be widened to the east. These improvements are shown
in Figure 12. As a result of the widening of Kentuck Road, there are existing power utility poles in
conflict, which will have to be relocated in conjunction with these improvements. The addition of turn
lanes will reduce delays and improve operation on the stop-controlled approaches, but the eastbound
and westbound approaches of Halifax Road will still operate at LOS C in both the AM and PM peak
hours. The intersection LOSs are shown in Table 5 below.

The preliminary estimate of probable cost indicates that these improvements could cost approximately
$927,000 to design and construct. A more detailed breakdown of the cost is included in Appendix H.

Alternative 2 consists of the addition of 100-foot left-turn lanes on the northbound and southbound
approaches as well as the installation of a traffic signal. However, based on an evaluation of the Manual
on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) Traffic Signal Warrants and four-hour traffic data, no
warrants are met at this location. The traffic signal warrant analysis is included in Appendix I for
reference. These improvements are shown in Figure 13. The improvements will raise the LOSs for both
the eastbound and westbound approaches to LOS B. The intersection LOSs resulting from these
improvements are shown in Table 6 below.

As can be seen in Table 6, the addition of a traffic signal will increase the delay along the major route,
Kentuck Road, but will raise the level of services for both the eastbound and westbound approaches.
The preliminary estimate of probable cost indicates that these improvements could cost approximately
$1,159,000 to design and construct. A more detailed breakdown of the cost is included in Appendix H.

Alternative 3 consists of the construction of a single-lane roundabout with widened approaches of each
leg. Figure 14 shows the improvements for this alternative. As a result of the construction of a
roundabout, many conflicts with existing utilities will arise. The main conflicts exist with the overhead
electric utility poles, but impacts to the underground water, gas or fiber optic lines could also occur.
With these improvements, the LOSs for all approaches will be LOS A. These LOSs are shown in Table 7
below.

The construction of a roundabout will not only increase the LOSs at this intersection (as can be seen in
Table 7) but should also help to reduce the frequency and severity of crashes. The preliminary estimate
of probable cost indicates that these improvements could cost approximately $2,539,000 to design and
construct. A more detailed breakdown of the cost is included in Appendix H.

In review of these three alternatives described above, all will increase the capacity of the intersection
but to different levels. Using the Evaluation Criteria identified in Table 4, the three alternatives were
compared to determine the preferred alternative, and this comparison is shown in greater detail in
Section VI of this report.

Intersection of Kentuck and Eagle Springs Road Improvement Alternatives

As identified on Figure 11, two alternatives for improvements at the intersection of Kentuck Road and
Eagle Springs Road were developed. Alternative 1 consists of the addition of a 100-foot right-turn lane
on the northbound approach. These improvements are shown in Figure 15. Because of this widening,
the existing power utility poles that are in conflict will need to be relocated. These improvements will
help reduce delays and improve operation on the stop-controlled approaches. The intersection LOSs are
shown in Table 8.

Intersection of Kentuck and Fall Creek/Little Creek Road Improvement Alternatives

As identified on Figure 11, three alternatives for improvements at the intersection of Kentuck Road and
Fall Creek Road/Little Creek Road were developed. Alternative 1 consists of the construction of a
center-turn lane on Kentuck Road between Fall Creek Road and Little Creek Road in addition to
construction of a 150-foot right-turn lane on the eastbound approach and extension of the right-turn
lane on the southbound approach to provide 100 feet of storage. Because of the addition of this center-
turn lane, Kentuck Road will be widened to the east. These improvements are shown in Figure 17. As a
result of the widening of Kentuck Road, the existing power utility poles that are in conflict will have to
be relocated. The addition of these turn lanes will help reduce delays and improve operation on the
stop-controlled approaches. The intersection LOSs are shown in Table 10 below.

* Please note that the LOSs are reported in accordance with the HCM designations.


The preliminary estimate of probable cost indicates that these improvements could cost approximately
$1,318,000 to design and construct. A more detailed breakdown of the cost is included in Appendix L.

Alternative 2 consists of shifting the alignments of Little Creek Road and Fall Creek Road and the
installation of a traffic signal. Based on an evaluation of the MUTCD Traffic Signal Warrants and four-
hour traffic data, Warrants 2 (Four-Hour Vehicular Volume) and 3B (Peak Hour) are met at this location.
The traffic signal warrant analysis is included in Appendix I for reference. In addition, the construction
of 100-foot left-turn lanes on the northbound and southbound approaches as well as a 100-foot left-
turn lane on the eastbound approach will be included. These improvements are shown in Figure 18. As
a result of the widening of Kentuck Road and relocation of Little Creek Road and Fall Creek Road, many
conflicts will arise with existing utilities and right-of-way acquisition. The addition of the turn lanes and
a traffic signal will significantly reduce delays and improve operation at this intersection, while also
increasing the safety along this section of roadway. The intersection LOSs are shown in Table 11.

The preliminary estimate of probable cost indicates that these improvements could cost approximately
$2,553,000 to design and construct. A more detailed breakdown of the cost is included in Appendix L.

Alternative 3 consists of shifting the alignments of Little Creek Road and Fall Creek Road and
construction of a single-lane roundabout with widened approaches. These improvements are shown in
Figure 19. The roundabout will help reduce delays and improve operation at this intersection, while also
increasing the safety along this section of roadway. The intersection LOSs are shown in Table XII.

The preliminary estimate of probable cost indicates that these improvements could cost approximately
$3,016,000 to design and construct. A more detailed breakdown of the cost is included in Appendix L.

In review of these three alternatives described above, all will increase the capacity and safety of the
intersection but to different levels. Using the Evaluation Criteria identified in Table 4, the three
alternatives were compared to determine the preferred alternative, and this comparison is shown in
greater detail in Section VI of this report.

VI. PREFERRED SPOT IMPROVEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Three locations along this segment of Kentuck Road have been identified for improvement as a result of
safety and capacity issues. The first area is at the intersection of Kentuck Road and Halifax Road. The
second spot is at the intersection of Kentuck Road and Eagle Springs Road. The last location is at the
intersection of Kentuck Road and Little Creek/Fall Creek Roads. Three alternative improvements were
analyzed for the first location, two alternative improvements were discussed for the second location,
and three alternative improvements were shown for the last location. As described in the previous
section, the alternatives will vary in cost and benefit to the roadway and intersection.




                                                                    33
   FINAL REPORT                                                       Kentuck Road - Planning Level Study



Beginning with Location 1, all of the alternatives will increase capacity and safety. The alternative
selected should provide the greatest benefit in traffic flow and public safety based upon the most recent
traffic data and design guidelines at the time of selection. Based upon the data and analysis included
within this report, the recommended alternative is the installation of a single lane roundabout with
widened approaches on each leg (Alternative 3). This improvement will increase the capacity of the
intersection and enhance the safety along this section of road. The installation of a traffic signal with
turn lanes (Alternative 2) is not recommended at this time because the signal is not warranted per VDOT
criteria. However, as the time for implementation of improvements approaches, new accident data and
traffic volumes can be collected to determine if signal warrants are met based on this new data. If a
signal is warranted then Alternative 2 is recommended. The alternative improvements at Location 2 are
also focused on increasing the capacity and bringing the future no-build LOSs up to the acceptable
range.

Both alternatives for Location 2 will increase the capacity of the intersection but to differing levels and
costs. Dewberry Engineers, Inc. and Ramey Kemp & Associates, Inc. recommend that Alternative 2
(Figure 16) be selected for the Preferred Alternative. This alternative includes the removal of the
northbound channelization and the addition of a 100-foot right-turn lane on the northbound approach
and a 100-foot right-turn lane on the westbound approach. These improvements will help reduce
delays and improve operation on the stop-controlled approaches, specifically adding capacity on the
left-turn movement on the westbound approach. The final recommendations along this segment of
Kentuck Road are at the intersection of Kentuck Road and Little Creek Road and Fall Creek Road.

All three alternatives will increase the capacity and safety of this intersection, but not all will bring the
LOSs to the acceptable range. Dewberry Engineers Inc. and Ramey Kemp & Associates Inc. recommend
that Alternative 2 (Figure 18) be selected for the Preferred Alternative. These improvements will
provide for the greatest increase in capacity and safety of this intersection while attempting to minimize
the impacts to the adjacent property owners.

With the implementation of these alternative improvements at the three locations, not only will the
safety along this segment of Kentuck Road be improved, but each intersection will operate at acceptable
LOSs in the Year 2035.

               LEVEL OF SERVICE METHODS AND CRITERIA
METHODOLOGY AND CRITERIA USED FOR THE LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS

All analyses were completed using the methodology outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)
2010 published by the Transportation Research Board. The computer software package of Synchro
(Version 8) was utilized to perform all signalized and unsignalized analyses at the study intersections
while SIDRA INTERSECTION 5.1 was utilized for roundabout analysis.

The HCM 2010 defines capacity as "the maximum sustainable hourly flow rate at which persons or
vehicles reasonably can be expected to traverse a point or a uniform section of a lane or roadway during
a given time period under prevailing roadway, environmental, traffic, and control conditions". Level of
service (LOS) is a term used to represent different driving conditions, and is defined as "a qualitative
stratification of a performance measure or measures that represent quality of service". Level of service
varies from Level "A" representing free flow to Level "F" where greater vehicle delays are evident. Refer
to the Table below for a summary of levels of service and related average control delay per vehicle for
both signalized and unsignalized intersections as well as roundabouts. Control delay as defined by the
HCM includes "vehicles slowing in advance of an intersection, the time spent stopped on an intersection
approach, the time spent as vehicles move up in the queue, and the time needed for vehicles to
accelerate to their desired speed". As shown in the Table, a control delay of 40 seconds at a signalized
intersection results in a LOS D operation.

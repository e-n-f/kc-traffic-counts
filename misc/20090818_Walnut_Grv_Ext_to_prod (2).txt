August 2009



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis of the planned Walnut Grove Drive extension
north of Dunne Avenue to Diana Avenue in Morgan Hill, California. The project under study is the change of the
Walnut Grove Drive extension to the west of the current planned extension by approximately 1,500 feet (west of
James Lex Lane). This report does include a cumulative traffic analysis for various pending General Plan
Amendments (GPA). The GPAs under consideration include update of the Circulation Element roadway network,
City-initiated roadway modifications, and land use changes within the Morgan Hill city limits or its Sphere of
Influence (SOI). This analysis did not identify potential project and cumulative impacts of the Walnut Grove Drive
extension on the surrounding transportation system.

YEAR 2030 CURRENT GENERAL PLAN PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
The project-level impacts of the proposed Alternative 1 or 2 Walnut Grove Drive alignment were evaluated by
comparing operations under Year 2030 Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions to Existing Conditions and
applying the 2001 General Plan Circulation Element LOS policies. The focus of this analysis and most long-range
planning efforts is on roadway segment operations, and not on peak hour or intersection-level operations.
However, the possible localized effects of the proposed project warrant evaluation of future intersection
operations to fully inform decision-makers and the public as to the likely impacts of the roadway extension.

ROADWAY SEGMENT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
No significant project impacts were identified at the five (5) study roadway segments.

INTERSECTION IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
No significant project impacts were identified at the three (3) study intersections.

NEIGHBORHOOD TRAFFIC IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
No significant neighborhood traffic project impacts were identified.

PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE, AND TRANSIT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The extension of Walnut Grove Drive would improve connectivity within the neighborhood and establish a more
direct route for pedestrians and bicyclist to/from Dunne Avenue and Diana Avenue. Pedestrians and bicyclists will
benefit from the continuous and complete pedestrian and bicycle facilities provided by the Walnut Grove Drive
extension, which is consistent with Goals 3 and 8 of the 2001 General Plan Circulation Element. Thus, the
Alternative 1 or 2 Walnut Grove Drive extension alignment would result in a beneficial impact to all non-auto
modes.

OTHER IMPROVEMENTS

St. Anthony Drive Extension

St. Anthony Drive is currently a short cul-de-sac street extending just south of Rosemary Circle west of the
proposed future commercial development area. A new public street connection linking St. Anthony Drive to Dunne
Avenue is included as part of a condition of approval for the new residential development in this area. This new
connection would provide an additional vehicle access route between the neighborhood and Dunne Avenue.



                                                                                                         i
Walnut Grove Drive Extension Transportation Impact Analysis ­ Draft Report
August 2009


Because of the circuitous path for vehicles to use the new connection and Rosemary Circle to travel between
Dunne Avenue and Diana Avenue, the use of the new connection is expected to be limited. However, the new
connection will reduce the amount of traffic that would use the Dunne Avenue/Butterfield Boulevard intersection
and would provide an additional circulation benefit for the overall area and reduce volumes on Diana Avenue
between Butterfield Boulevard and Calle Mazatan.

Neighborhood Traffic Management

To minimize potential impacts to the adjacent neighborhood, neighborhood traffic management measures could
be implemented to ensure that traffic on the key study roadways maintains appropriate travel speeds. Changes in
speed cannot be accurately predicted even with an increase in traffic volume. Measures designed to change
traffic volumes are not considered feasible given the limited number of access opportunities and a desire to not
overburden any individual street segment. The City maintains a neighborhood traffic management program
(NTMP) that delineates the process of requesting and implementing traffic calming measures and devices. This
neighborhood could receive special priority if the planned extension was constructed and a regular monitoring
program could be established if no other actions are taken.

Restricted Access

One potential measure to limit the amount of commercial traffic that would access the neighborhood via the
planned extension is the installation of turn restrictions at the Walnut Grove Drive/Laurel Road intersection.
These restrictions would preclude vehicles on Laurel Road from accessing Walnut Grove Drive to and from the
north through the use of median diverters and signage. However, these restrictions would apply to residents of
the adjacent neighborhood, and residents driving to access the retail areas would have to travel on Butterfield
Boulevard and Dunne Avenue.

YEAR 2030 CUMULATIVE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT (GPA) CONDITIONS
The impacts of the proposed Alternative 1 or 2 Walnut Grove Drive alignment were evaluated by comparing
operations under Year 2030 Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions to Existing Conditions and applying the
2001 General Plan Circulation Element LOS policies. The cumulative impact conclusions were identical to the
Year 2030 Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions project-level impacts summarized above.

SUMMARY OF PROJECT BENEFITS
The planned extension will improve connectivity of the existing roadway network by providing additional travel
options for residents of the study neighborhood. The extension will provide more direct public access to the
existing and planned retail developments on Dunne Avenue south of the neighborhood, as well as to the freeway
interchange. This new public access will help to encourage the use of bicycling and walking by providing a shorter
route that also does not require travel on major roadways such as Butterfield Boulevard and Dunne Avenue. The
new connection will also better link the neighborhoods north and south of Dunne Avenue as envisioned in the
city's General Plan Circulation Element. Emergency access and response times to the neighborhood would be
improved substantially with the extension and would better distribute emergency call volume between the two fire
stations serving this part of the City.

Walnut Grove Drive Extension Transportation Impact Analysis ­ Draft Report
August 2009



1. INTRODUCTION
This report evaluates the transportation impacts of the planned Walnut Grove Drive extension north of Dunne
Avenue to Diana Avenue west of James Lex Lane in Morgan Hill, California. The update was completed using a
new transportation demand model developed by Fehr & Peers in early 2009.

The proposed extension is included in the City's 2001 General Plan Circulation Element from Laurel Road to the
existing terminus of Walnut Grove Drive located immediately west of the US 101 freeway. The Walnut Grove
Drive extension intended to better distribute local vehicle traffic, pedestrians, and bicyclists across the roadway
network and improve access to major east-west corridors (e.g., Dunne Avenue and Main Avenue). The
connection would provide direct access to the adjacent neighborhood located between Butterfield Boulevard and
US Highway 101 and north of Diana Avenue. Based on direct from the Morgan Hill City Council, Fehr & Peers
was requested to analyze the Walnut Grove Drive connection between Diana Avenue and Dunne Avenue with the
following three extension alternatives (see Figure 1):

    ·   No extension of Walnut Grove Drive (informational alternative);
    ·   Existing General Plan alignment of Walnut Grove Drive from Laurel Road to the existing terminus of
        Walnut Grove Drive west of US 101 (no project alternative); and,
    ·   Two project alternatives west of James Lex Lane (e.g., Alternative 1 to Diana Avenue closer to Lotus
        Way, and Alternative 2 to Diana Avenue closer to Rosemary Circle).

For purposes of this TIA, the project is defined as Alternatives 1 and 2 with Alternative 2 defined as the preferred
alternative. These alternatives both extend north from the Walnut Grove Drive extension west of the Trader Joe's
store to Diana Avenue. Thus, traffic volume forecasts for either alignment would be similar. The "No Extension of
Walnut Grove Drive" condition is an informational alternative to the project, and the Existing General Plan
alignment represents the "No Project" scenario.

Project and cumulative impacts were evaluated following the guidelines of the City of Morgan Hill and the Santa
Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), which is the congestion management agency for Santa Clara
County. The focus of this analysis and most long-range planning efforts is on roadway segment operations, and
not on peak hour or intersection-level operations. However, the possible localized effects of the proposed project
warrant evaluation of future intersection operations to fully inform decision-makers and the public as to the likely
impacts of the roadway extension.

As presented in Figure 1 at the end of this chapter, this analysis evaluated the daily two-way roadway operations
for the following study segments:

    ·   Calle Mazatan between Main Avenue and Diana Avenue
    ·   Grand Prix Way between Main Avenue and Diana Avenue
    ·   Serene Drive between Main Avenue and Diana Avenue
    ·   Diana Avenue between Butterfield Boulevard and Calle Mazatan
    ·   Walnut Grove Drive extension between Diana Avenue and Dunne Avenue

The analysis also evaluated the AM and PM peak hour operations of the following study intersections, which are
presented in Figure 1 at the end of this chapter:

    ·   Dunne Avenue and Butterfield Boulevard
    ·   Dunne Avenue and Walnut Grove Drive
    ·   Dunne Avenue and Laurel Road



                                                                                                          1
Walnut Grove Drive Extension Transportation Impact Analysis ­ Draft Report
August 2009



The operations of the daily roadway segments and study intersections during the weekday morning (AM) and
evening (PM) peak hours were evaluated for the following four (4) scenarios:

        Scenario 1:      Existing Conditions ­ Existing volumes obtained from counts.

        Scenario 2:      Year 2030 Current General Plan Conditions ­ Year 2030 cumulative traffic volumes based
                         on City provided land use that includes approved and pending development projects, plus
                         roadway improvements from the July 2001 General Plan Circulation Element including the
                         existing General Plan alignment from Laurel Road to the existing terminus of Walnut
                         Grove Drive west of US 101.

        Scenario 3:      Year 2030 Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions ­ Scenario 2 traffic conditions
                         plus the Alternatives 1 & 2 Walnut Grove Drive alignments west of James Lex Lane
                         (project alternative). The "No Extension of Walnut Grove Drive" condition is an
                         informational alternative to the project.

        Scenario 4:      Year 2030 Cumulative General Plan Amendment Conditions ­ Year 2030 cumulative
                         traffic volumes based on City provided land use that includes approved and pending
                         development projects, (i.e., private General Plan Amendment applications and City-
                         initiated land use General Plan Amendments) plus funded and recommended roadway
                         improvements for the revised General Plan Circulation Element for each alignment
                         alternative (i.e., 1) no extension, existing General Plan alignment, and 3) Alternatives 1 &
                         2 alignments west of James Lex Lane).

Project-level impacts of the proposed Walnut Grove Drive extension were evaluated by comparing operations
under Year 2030 Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions (Scenario 3) to Existing Conditions. Cumulative
impacts were identified by comparing the Scenario 4 operations to Existing Conditions. The effect of the extension
on existing and planned bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities and services was also reviewed. The City of
Morgan Hill travel demand forecasting model was used to estimate traffic volumes for each Year 2030 scenario
and extension alternative. Using the base year and future year model forecasts, we developed weekday daily and
peak-hour forecasts for intersection turning movements, and roadway segments within the study area. The local
effect on traffic this project will have a negligible effect on freeway operations and therefore was not studied.

The remainder of this report is divided into four chapters.

    ·     Chapter 2 ­ Existing Conditions

    ·     Chapter 3 ­ Current General Plan Conditions

    ·     Chapter 4 ­ Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions

    ·     Chapter 5 ­ Year 2030 Cumulative GPA Conditions

A technical appendix is also attached, which contains counts and operations analysis that is referenced in this
report.

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the existing conditions of the roadway facilities, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, transit
service, traffic volumes, and intersection operations. A discussion of the method used to calculate intersection
levels of service (LOS) and the corresponding results is also presented in this chapter.

EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK
This section describes the existing roadway network near the project site, which is illustrated on Figure 1.
Regional access is provided via US 101 and local access is provided via Dunne Road, Butterfield Boulevard,
Laurel Road, Diana Avenue, Main Avenue, and Walnut Grove Drive. Each of these roadways is described below:

U.S. Highway 101 (US 101) is a north-south freeway that serves as the primary roadway connection between
Morgan Hill and all other areas of Santa Clara County. US 101 extends north to San Francisco and south to Los
Angeles. The freeway includes six lanes (three mixed-flow lanes in each direction) within most of Morgan Hill.
North of Cochrane Road, US 101 widens to eight lanes (three mixed-flow lanes and one high occupancy vehicle
(HOV) lane in each direction).The Dunne Avenue interchange provides regional access to the project site.

Butterfield Boulevard is a north-south, four-lane, divided arterial that extends northward from Tennant Avenue to
Cochrane Road. Butterfield Boulevard forms the eastern boundary of the downtown area and is west of the
project site.

Calle Mazatan is a north-south, two-lane local roadway that extends northward from Diana Avenue to Central
Avenue. It provides local access to for residential units north of the project.

Diana Avenue is an east-west, two-lane collector roadway north of extension alternatives. This street extends
through Morgan Hill in two segments but does not cross US 101. The segment adjacent to the project site
extends from US 101 to the Union Pacific railroad tracks. The eastern segment extends from US 101 east to
McDonald Lane

Dunne Avenue is an east-west, four-lane, divided arterial roadway located south of the project site. This street
extends through the City, from John Telfer Drive in western Morgan Hill to Anderson Lake in eastern Morgan Hill.
Dunne Avenue serves both residential, commercial and institutional uses along its length.

Grand Prix Way is a north-south, two-lane local roadway that extends northward from Diana Avenue to Central
Avenue. It provides local access to residential uses north of the project area.

Laurel Road is a two-lane local roadway located south of the extension alternatives. Laurel Road intersects both
Walnut Grove Drive and Dunne Avenue. The eastern end of Laurel Road serves the automobile dealership
property west of US 101.

Main Avenue is an east-west, two-lane undivided arterial roadway located north of the project site. Main Avenue
extends through Morgan Hill, from John Telfer Drive in western Morgan Hill to Liberata Drive in eastern Morgan
Hill. This street serves mostly residential areas, as well as downtown Morgan Hill and the civic center to the west,
and Live Oak High School to the east.

Serene Drive is a north-south, two-lane collector roadway that extends northward from Walnut Grove Drive to
Sutter Boulevard. Serene Drive is discontinuous between Jarvis Drive and north of Central Avenue. It provides
local access to residences north of the project area.

Walnut Grove Drive is a two-lane roadway comprised of several segments. Two segments extend north and south
of Diana Avenue, with the southern segment terminating just north of the project site, and both serving residential




                                                                                                           4

uses. The second segment extends through the study area from Laurel Road across Dunne Avenue to San Pedro
Avenue and serves commercial and residential areas.

EXISTING PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE FACILITIES
The mild climate, relatively flat terrain, and proximity of many recreational and non-recreational destinations
provide an ideal environment for walking and bicycling in the City of Morgan Hill. This section describes the
existing pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure.

Pedestrian Facilities

Pedestrian facilities comprise sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian signals, and off-street paths that are meant to
provide safe and convenient routes for pedestrians to access destinations such as institutions, businesses, public
transportation, and recreation facilities. Goal 8 of the City of Morgan Hill General Plan Circulation Element
addresses sidewalks and pedestrian paths in the City (July 2001).

Portions of Diana Avenue near the project site do not have sidewalks. Crosswalks controlled by pedestrian
signals are located at both signalized study intersections. The unsignalized intersection of Dunne Avenue/Laurel
Drive has a crosswalk across the north leg of the intersection. Pedestrian crossings are not permitted across
Dunne Avenue at the Dunne Avenue/Laurel Drive unsignalized intersection. Existing pedestrian access between
Diana Avenue and Dunne Avenue is circuitous and requires travel on Butterfield Boulevard.

Bicycle Facilities

Bikeway planning and design in California typically relies on the guidelines and design standards established by
Caltrans in the Highway Design Manual (Chapter 1000: Bikeway Planning and Design, 5th Edition, California
Department of Transportation, January 2001). Chapter 1000 follows standards developed by the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA), and identifies specific design standards for various conditions and bikeway-to-roadway relationships.
Under California Law, bicyclists are allowed to use all roadways in California unless posted otherwise. Like
pedestrian facilities, bicycle networks are typically included in the General Plan, along with any proposed
improvements or extensions. Goal 7 of the City of Morgan Hill General Plan Circulation Element defines the
existing and planned bicycle network in the City.

Caltrans standards provide for three (3) distinct types of bikeway facilities, as generally described below and
shown on the accompanying figures.

    ·   Class I Bikeway (Bike Path) provides a completely separate right-of-way and is designated for the
        exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians with vehicle and pedestrian cross-flow minimized. In general,
        bike paths serve corridors not served by streets and highways or where sufficient right-of-way exists to
        allow such facilities to be constructed away from the influence of parallel streets and numerous vehicle
        conflicts.




                                                                                                         5
Walnut Grove Drive Extension Transportation Impact Analysis ­ Draft Report
August 2009


    ·   Class II Bikeways (Bike Lanes) are lanes for bicyclists adjacent to the outer vehicle travel lanes. These
        lanes have special lane markings, pavement legends, and signage. Bicycle lanes are generally five (5)
        feet wide. Adjacent vehicle parking and vehicle/pedestrian cross-flow are permitted.




    ·   Class III Bikeway (Bike Route) are designated by signs or pavement markings for shared use with
        pedestrians or motor vehicles, but have no separated bike right-of-way or lane striping. Bike routes serve
        either to: a) provide continuity to other bicycle facilities, or b) designate preferred routes through high
        demand corridors.




Figure 2 shows the existing bicycle facilities near the project site. Existing bicycle access between Diana Avenue
and Dunne Avenue is circuitous and requires travel on Butterfield Boulevard. No Class I bike paths exist near the
project. Class II bike lanes are located along the following roadways in the study area:

    ·   Main Avenue west of US 101
    ·   Dunne Avenue between Monterey Road and US 101
    ·   Dunne Avenue east of Murphy Avenue
    ·   Butterfield Boulevard

Class III bike routes are provided on along the following roadways:

    ·   Main Avenue east of US 101

EXISTING TRANSIT SERVICE
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) operates fixed route, commuter, and paratransit bus
service and light rail service (LRT) in Santa Clara County. VTA provides four bus routes (two local and two
regional) that serve the project area. The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board operates Caltrain commuter rail
service between San Francisco and San Jose, with weekday commute-hour service to Morgan Hill and Gilroy.
Monterey Salinas Transit (MST) operates transit service in Monterey County, and provides express bus service to
Morgan Hill and San Jose. Existing transit service near the project is illustrated on Figure 3 and is discussed in
more detail below.

Route 16 operates along East Main Avenue near the project site. Route 16 operates between the Morgan Hill
Civic Center and Sobrato High School on Burnett Avenue. No weekend service is available.

Route 68 operates along Monterey Road west of the project site. Route 68 provides connections to cities within
the Santa Clara County.

Route 121 operates through Morgan Hill via Butterfield Boulevard and Monterey Road. Route 121 provides
connections with route 68 and Caltrain Station in Morgan Hill. No weekend service is available.

Route 168 operates through Morgan Hill via Butterfield Boulevard and Monterey Road. Route 121 provides
connections with route 68 and Caltrain Station in Morgan Hill. No weekend service is available.

MST 55 operates through Morgan Hill via US 101 and includes a stop at the Caltrain Station in Morgan Hill.

Caltrain provides frequent daily train service between San Jose and San Francisco. Service extends south to
Gilroy during commute hours, with three northbound trips during the AM peak period and three southbound trips
during the PM peak period stopping at the Morgan Hill Caltrain Station. Table 1 summarizes hours of operation
and service frequencies for these bus routes.

August 2009



EXISTING VOLUMES AND LANE CONFIGURATIONS
The operations of the study intersections were evaluated during the weekday AM and PM peak hours.
Intersection operations were evaluated for the highest one-hour volume counted between each of the 7:00 and
9:00 AM and the 4:00 and 6:00 PM peak periods. Intersection turning movement counts were conducted in
October 2007, May 2008 and April 2009. Figure 4 presents the existing AM and PM peak-hour turning movement
volumes, the existing intersection lane configurations, and traffic control devices for the three (3) study
intersections.

Given the limited amount of development on residential streets north of Diana Avenue, this report uses the daily
roadway segment volumes collected in December 2004 when school was in session. Existing daily traffic volumes
for each segment were extrapolated from the peak hour counts assuming the total AM and PM peak-hour
volumes are equal to 20 percent of the daily volume. The daily volumes for each study segment of on Grand Prix
Way, Calle Mazatan, and Serene Drive are presented on Figure ES-1 and range from 800 vehicles per day (vpd)
to 1,920 vpd. The existing daily volume on Diana Avenue east of Butterfield Boulevard is 3,300 vpd, and is less
for segments near the eastern end of the street. The traffic counts are included in Appendix A.

The physical capacity of a residential street with front-on housing is much higher than the volume that can be
tolerated by residents from a livability or "quality of life" standpoint. While a roadway is typically constrained by
the traffic control devices installed at intersections along a roadway, the actual capacity of a street with one-lane
in each direction is in excess of 7,500 vehicles per day (vpd). The volume that is considered reasonable by
residents in terms of perceived safety, convenience (in terms of backing out of a driveway), and noise is far less,
but the threshold for local and residential collector streets varies by community.

The City of Morgan Hill maintains a Neighborhood Traffic Management Program (NTMP) that delineates minimum
volume criteria to identify candidate streets for NTMP application. The minimum volume is 3,500 vpd for a
collector street and 2,000 vpd for a local street. All four of the study roadway segments function as collector
streets by linking Diana Avenue to Main Avenue or by serving as the primary distribution corridor for intersecting
local streets.

EXISTING LEVEL OF SERVICE METHODS AND POLICIES
The operations of roadway facilities are described with the term level of service (LOS). LOS is a qualitative
description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six levels
are defined from LOS A, with the least congested operating conditions, to LOS F, with the most congested
operating conditions. LOS E represents "at-capacity" operations. Operations are designated as LOS F when
volumes exceed capacity, resulting in stop-and-go conditions.

Roadway Segments

Roadway segments in Morgan Hill were analyzed using comparison of the daily volume to threshold volumes for
various roadway types presented in Table 2. It is important to note that daily volume thresholds are used for
planning purposes and traffic during peak periods may result in worse operations than illustrated by the daily
LOS. The City of Morgan Hill does not have a formally adopted roadway segment operating standard. Thus, for
the purposes of this analysis and to be consistent with planning efforts in Morgan Hill and other jurisdictions, LOS
D was used as a guideline for the long-range planning evaluation of daily segment volumes.

Notes:
 1
         The LOS capacity thresholds are based on HCM 2000 methodology and are generally appropriate for suburban and rural areas.
 2
         Non-directional peak hour traffic volumes are assumed to be 10% of the daily traffic volume. Directional split is assumed 70/30. For 2-
         lane arterial and 4-lane undivided arterial a directional split of 60/40 is assumed. All volumes are approximate and assume ideal
         roadway characteristics.
 3
         LOS A and B are not achievable for arterial roadways using the HCM 2000 methods.
 4
         For local and collector roadway segments, the capacity limitation is related to neighborhood quality of life rather than the physical
         carrying capacity of the road. This assumes a standard suburban neighborhood, 40-foot roadway width, and 25 mile per hour speed
         limit with normal speed violation rates.

Signalized Intersections

The LOS method for signalized intersections approved by the City of Morgan Hill and VTA analyzes intersection
operations based on average control vehicular delay, as described in Chapter 16 of the 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM) published by the Transportation Research Board, with adjusted saturation flow rates to reflect
conditions in Santa Clara County. Control delay includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped
delay, and final acceleration delay. The average control delay for signalized intersections is calculated using
TRAFFIX analysis software and is correlated to a LOS designation as shown in Table 3.

Current General Plan Circulation Element LOS Policy

The City of Morgan Hill currently maintains a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D+ (i.e., less than 39.0
seconds of delay) for local signalized intersections and LOS E at freeway ramp intersections. Per the City of
Morgan Hill General Plan (July 2001), three signalized intersections are allowed to operate at LOS D (up to 55
seconds of delay), where achieving LOS D+ would require extraordinary development expenditure and right-of-
way acquisition:

Unsignalized Intersections

Operations of the unsignalized study intersections are evaluated using the method contained in Chapter 17 of the
2000 HCM and calculated using TRAFFIX analysis software. LOS ratings for stop-sign controlled intersections
are based on the average control delay expressed in seconds per vehicle. At two-way or side-street-stop
controlled intersections, control delay is calculated for each movement, not for the intersection as a whole. For
approaches composed of a single lane, delay is computed as the average of all movements in that lane. For all-
way stop-controlled locations, a weighted average delay for the entire intersection is presented. Table 4
summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections. In accordance with its
adopted Guidelines for Preparation of Transportation Impact Analyses the City uses a minimum acceptable
operating level of LOS D for unsignalized intersections and a review of peak hour signal warrants to identify
significant traffic impacts.

EXISTING ROADWAY SEGMENT LEVEL OF SERVICE
Existing roadway types and daily two-way volumes were used as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of
the LOS analysis for Existing Conditions are presented in Table 5. Measured against the City of Morgan Hill LOS
standards, none of the roadway segments will operate at an unacceptable LOS (LOS E or worse) under daily
conditions.

EMERGENCY ACCESS
Emergency access to the study area is provided via Diana Avenue, Main Avenue, and Central Avenue. The
neighborhood is located approximately midway between the two City-serving fire stations: one located on Old
Monterey Road to the west and he second located on Dunne Avenue east of US 101. Based on information
provided by the Santa Clara County Fire Department staff, the neighborhood is currently served by the El Toro
Fire Station on Monterey Road, where the existing response time to the proposed Diana Avenue/Walnut Grove
Drive intersection is approximately 6 minutes. Factors that currently cause higher response times include
passenger and freight trains at several crossings, as well as traffic volumes on Monterey Road especially at peak
commute times and on holidays. The response time from the Dunne Hill Fire Station is longer at 6.5 minutes
depending on traffic. Response time is critical in terms of both life and property protection with critical events
occurring during the first 4 to 8 minutes of an occurrence.

The closest major hospital is St. Louise Regional Medical Center located in Gilroy approximately eight miles to the
south. As noted above, every minute saved in travel time can result in a significant improvement in life protection.

FIELD OBSERVATIONS
Field observations of the study intersections were conducted in June and October 2007, and April 2008 and 2009
to verify their operations. In general, observations indicated that all of the study intersections are operating at or
near the calculated levels of service. Queuing was observed at the signalized intersection with calculated LOS D
operations, however, most of the vehicle queues typically cleared this intersection within one cycle. The
unsignalized intersection of Dunne Avenue and Laurel Road was observed to operate acceptably, with side street
traffic volumes finding gaps to enter the intersection.

August 2009



3. YEAR 2030 CURRENT GENERAL PLAN CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the expected traffic operations under Year 2030 Current General Plan Conditions. This
scenario represents the current General Plan Alignment of Walnut Grove Drive extension from Laurel Road to
Walnut Grove Drive just east of the automobile dealership property. The City of Morgan Hill travel demand
forecasting model was used to estimate Year 2030 traffic volumes. Year 2030 land use and network assumptions
are briefly discussed and followed by a more detailed discussion of roadway and intersection operations.

LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION NETWORK ASSUMPTIONS
The City's travel demand forecasting model was used to develop Year 2030 Current General Plan traffic volume
estimates. The Morgan Hill TDF model has a base year of 2007 and horizon year of 2030, thus reflecting 23 years
of growth in the City and the surrounding region. Future land use data is instrumental in estimating daily and peak
hour trip generation and subsequently future traffic demand. As discussed in the Morgan Hill Travel Demand
Forecasting Model & Future Improvements Study (Fehr & Peers, June 2009), Year 2030 land use estimates were
based on input from City of Morgan Hill and regionally approved data from the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG) Projections 2003 south of Morgan Hill in San Martin and Gilroy.

The 2001 General Plan Circulation Element describes the planned roadway network to be built and is
summarized in Appendix J of the Morgan Hill Travel Demand Forecasting Model & Future Improvements Study
(June 2009). All planned roadway improvements were included for the Year 2030 network except: 1) the
extension of Butterfield Boulevard from Tennant Avenue to Middle Avenue, 2) construction of the Middle Avenue
interchange, and 3) widening of Murphy Avenue from Dunne avenue to Middle Avenue.

CURRENT GENERAL PLAN ROADWAY TRAFFIC VOLUME ESTIMATES
Using the base year and future year model forecasts, weekday daily and peak-hour (7:30-8:30 AM and 4:30-5:30
PM) forecasts were developed for intersection turning movements at the three (3) study intersections, as well as
on roadway segments within the study area. For this study, the guidelines published in National Cooperative
Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 2551 was applied to refine the raw model forecasts. This method is
based on the difference between counts and model volumes and helps to normalize the model projections based
on the accuracy of the validation.

Figure 5 shows the AM and PM peak hour intersection turning movement forecasts volumes, intersection lane
configurations, and traffic control devices for the three study intersections under Year 2030 Current General Plan
Roadway Conditions.

CURRENT GENERAL PLAN ROADWAY SEGMENT LEVEL OF SERVICE
Year 2030 Current General Plan improvements and daily two-way volumes were used as inputs for the LOS
calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for Year 2030 Current General Plan Conditions are presented in
Table 7. Measured against the City of Morgan Hill LOS standards, none of the roadway segments will operate at
an unacceptable level under daily conditions with the current General Plan improvements. Future daily volumes
were rounded to the nearest 100 vehicles.

CURRENT GENERAL PLAN INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE
Existing intersection configurations were modified to accommodate planned roadway widenings (e.g. Butterfield
Boulevard widened between Cochrane Road and Tennant Avenue).

Year 2030 current General Plan roadway intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak-hour turning
movement volumes were used as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for Year 2030
Current General Plan Conditions are presented in Table 8. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation
sheets. Measured against the City's current LOS D+ standard for signalized intersections, all study intersections
would operate at acceptable levels.

4. YEAR 2030 CURRENT GENERAL PLAN PLUS PROJECT
   CONDITIONS
This chapter describes expected traffic operations under Year 2030 Current General Plan Plus Project
Conditions. This chapter evaluates and identifies project impacts of the proposed Walnut Grove Drive extension
alternatives 1 and 2 west of James Lex Lane. Year 2030 land use and network assumptions are briefly discussed
and followed by a more detailed discussion of intersection and roadway operations.

LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION NETWORK ASSUMPTIONS
The Year 2030 Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions scenario uses the same land use and roadway
assumptions as the Year 2030 Current General Plan Conditions. Based on direct from the Morgan Hill City
Council, Fehr & Peers was requested to analyze the two Walnut Grove Drive project alternatives west of James
Lex Lane with Alternative 1 to Diana Avenue closer to Lotus Way, and Alternative 2 to Diana Avenue closer to
Rosemary Circle (see Figure 1):

For purposes of this TIA, the project is defined as Alternatives 1 and 2 with Alternative 2 defined as the preferred
alternative. These alternatives both extend north from the Walnut Grove Drive extension west of the Trader Joe's
store to Diana Avenue. Thus, traffic volume forecasts for either alignment would be similar. The "No Extension of
Walnut Grove Drive" condition is an informational alternative to the project, and the Existing General Plan
alignment represents the "No Project" scenario.

CURRENT GENERAL PLAN PLUS PROJECT ROADWAY TRAFFIC VOLUME ESTIMATES
The same forecast method discussed in Chapter 3 was used for the intersection and roadway segments study
locations under Year 2030 Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions. Figure ES 1 shows the daily roadway
segment volumes for each Walnut Grove Drive extension alternative under Year 2030 General Plan Conditions.
While Figure 6 shows the AM and PM peak hour intersection turning movement forecasts volumes for the three
(3) study intersections under Year 2030 Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions for each extension
alternative.

CURRENT GENERAL PLAN PLUS PROJECT ROADWAY SEGMENT LEVEL OF SERVICE
Year 2030 current General Plan roadway improvements and daily two-way volumes were used as inputs for the
LOS calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for Year 2030 Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions are
presented in Table 9. Measured against the City of Morgan Hill LOS standards, none of the roadway segments
will operate at an unacceptable level under daily conditions with the three Walnut Grove Drive extension
alternatives in place. However, Diana Avenue between Butterfield Boulevard and Calle Mazatan will exceed 3,500
daily vehicles per day (vpd) without the extension and the current General Plan alignment.

As shown in Table 9, the daily traffic volume on all three north-south streets and Diana Avenue is expected to
increase by 0 to 69 percent with the development of future residential uses without the extension. The volumes on
Grand Prix Way and Serene Drive are projected to increase to 800 and 1,800 vehicles per day, respectively,
which are within the planning capacity of a local residential street with front-on housing of 2,000 vpd. The daily
volume on Calle Mazatan is projected to be approximately 2,200 vpd, which occurs on a street south of El Toro
Elementary School. Some existing and future traffic on this street is from vehicles diverting from Butterfield
Boulevard. The 2030 volume on Diana Avenue without the extension is projected to be 4,300 vpd east of
Butterfield Boulevard, which substantially exceeds the City's target threshold of 3,500 vpd for a residential
collector street.




                                                                                                           21

August 2009


Relative to the no extension alternative, Alternatives 1 and 2 will increase daily traffic on Serene Drive by 400 vpd
and reduce daily traffic on Diana Avenue by 1,300 vpd (or an approximate decrease of one vehicle every 30
seconds during the peak hour). A portion of the increased traffic is from the improved connectivity and shifting of
existing traffic within the neighborhood. Calle Mazatan and Grand Prix Way total daily volumes are not estimated
to change substantially; however, existing daily traffic will shift to and from the west on Diana Avenue to the
eastern segments with the extension in place. The increase in volume on Serene Drive with the western Walnut
Grove Drive extension alignments (i.e., Alternative 1 or 2) of 400 vehicles per day translates to a potential
increase of one vehicle every 1-1/2 minutes during the peak hour. All of the key neighborhood roadways are
expected to serve volumes of less than 3,000 vpd, which is well within the collector street volume threshold. The
current General Plan Walnut Grove Drive alignment will server fewer daily vehicles because it is farther east than
the Alternative 1 and 2 alignments and results in a more circuitous route for much of the traffic from the greater
neighborhood.

The projected volume of 1,400 to 2,600 vpd could easily be accommodated by the planned two-lane Walnut
Grove Drive extension south of Diana Avenue. This section will have adequate capacity for vehicles turning from
intersecting side streets. The provision of left-turn lanes or a two-way center left-turn lane would provide additional
capacity and would further reduce any minor delays on this roadway, but is not required for the roadway to
operate acceptably. In fact, a wider street would likely contribute to faster travel speeds. The fact that the planned
extension will not connect directly opposite Serene Drive will help to discourage through traffic from diverting
through the neighborhood by not representing an "obvious" connection. The extension will greatly improve
vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian access to the commercial area and freeway access for residents of the
neighborhood.

CURRENT GENERAL PLAN PLUS PROJECT INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE
Year 2030 Current General Plan roadway intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak-hour turning
movement volumes were used as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for Year 2030
Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions are presented in Table 10. Appendix B contains the corresponding
calculation sheets. All intersections are projected to operate acceptably during both the AM and PM peak hours
under all three alternatives.

EMERGENCY ACCESS
As described in Chapter 2, emergency vehicle access to the study neighborhood is provided via Diana Avenue,
Main Avenue, and Central Avenue. The neighborhood bounded by Butterfield Boulevard, Main Avenue, US 101
and Diana Avenue is currently served by the El Toro Fire Station with an existing response time of 6 minutes that
can be affected by train activity and peak traffic volumes. Santa Clara County Fire Department representatives
estimate that the construction of the Walnut Grove Drive extension would allow the neighborhood to be better
served by the Dunne/Hill Fire Station. According to Fire Department estimates, the existing response time of 6.5
minutes could be reduced to approximately 4 minutes depending on the level of ambient traffic. Train activity
would not be an issue for a Dunne/Hill Station response, and traffic congestion would typically be less from this
location. Lastly, the call volume for the Dunne/Hill Station is less than El Toro, resulting in more reliable
responses. With improved emergency response, the Department's ability to fight structural and grass fires near
the US Highway 101 corridor would also be enhanced. The Fire Department has indicated that the proposed
Walnut Grove Drive extension would benefit the subject neighborhood and result in improved life and property
protection.

Travel time to the nearest hospital near Gilroy would be improved by an estimated 1 to 2 minutes (depending on
traffic conditions) with more direct access to Dunne Avenue and the Dunne Avenue/US 101 interchange. The
provision of the new extension would also provide an additional egress route from the neighborhood in the event
of a major evacuation.

CURRENT GENERAL PLAN PLUS PROJECT IMPACT CRITERIA
With one exception, the determination of significance for project impacts is based on applicable policies,
regulations, goals, and guidelines defined by the City of Morgan Hill. The City does not have a formally adopted
roadway segment operating standard. Thus, for the purposes of this analysis and to be consistent with planning
efforts in Morgan Hill and other jurisdictions, LOS D was used as a guideline for the long-range planning
evaluation of daily segment volumes. The detailed impact criteria for this study are presented below. The impacts
of the Alternative 1 and 2 Walnut Grove Drive extension alternatives were evaluated by comparing operations
with the Year 2030 Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions to Existing Conditions.

Roadway Segments

Roadway segment impacts are defined to occur when the proposed changes to the General Plan Circulation
Element causes:




                                                                                                                                         26
Walnut Grove Drive Extension Transportation Impact Analysis ­ Draft Report
August 2009


    ·   Roadway segment operations to deteriorate from an acceptable level (LOS D or better) under Existing
        Conditions to an unacceptable level; or
    ·   An increase in volume of one (1) percent in the capacity of a roadway segment that is already operating
        unacceptably under Existing Conditions.

Neighborhood Traffic

According to the City of Morgan Hill, the proposed project would be determined to result in a significant
neighborhood traffic impact if implementation of the project causes the average weekday daily traffic volume to
exceed 2,000 vehicles per day (vpd) on a local residential street or 3,500 vpd on a residential collector street.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Impact Criteria

The City of Morgan Hill 2001 General Plan Circulation Element Goals 7 and 8 describe related policies necessary
to ensure that these facilities are safe and effective for City residents. Map 5 of the 2001 General Plan Circulation
Element presents the existing bicycle network and identifies any future improvements. Using the General Plan as
a guide, significant impacts to pedestrian and bicycle facilities would occur when a project or an element of the
project:

    ·   creates a hazardous condition that currently does not exist for pedestrians or bicyclists, or otherwise
        interferes with pedestrian accessibility to the site and adjoining areas; or

    ·   conflicts with an existing or planned pedestrian or bicycle facility; or

    ·   conflicts with policies related to bicycle and pedestrian activity adopted by the City of Morgan Hill, Santa
        Clara County, VTA, or Caltrans for their respective facilities in the study area.

Construction-related impacts are generally not considered significant, since they are temporary and limited in
duration.

Transit Impact Criteria

Significant impacts to transit service would occur if the project or any part of the project:

    ·   conflicts with an existing or planned transit facility; or

    ·   conflicts with transit policies adopted by the City of Morgan Hill, Santa Clara County, VTA, or Caltrans for
        their respective facilities in the study area.

Signalized Intersections

Intersection impacts of the proposed project were evaluated by comparing the results of the Year 2030 Current
General Plan plus Project Condition LOS calculations to the results for Existing Conditions. In the City, significant
traffic impacts at signalized intersections are defined to occur when the addition of traffic from the proposed
changes to the General Plan Circulation Element causes:

    ·   Operations at signalized intersections to deteriorate from an acceptable level under Existing Conditions to
        an unacceptable level. Thus, a significant cumulative impact occurs at these signalized intersections
        when operations deteriorate from an acceptable level under Existing Conditions to an unacceptable level.




                                                                                                            27
Walnut Grove Drive Extension Transportation Impact Analysis ­ Draft Report
August 2009


    ·   Exacerbation of unacceptable operations by increasing the critical delay by more than four seconds and
        increasing the volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio by 0.01 or more at an intersection operating at unacceptable
        levels under Existing Conditions.

    ·   The V/C ratio increases by 0.01 or more at an intersection with unacceptable operations when the change
        in critical delay is negative (i.e., decreases). This can occur if the critical movements change.

Unsignalized Intersections

For this analysis, significant traffic impacts at unsignalized intersections are defined to occur when the addition of
traffic from the proposed changes to the General Plan Circulation Element causes:

    ·   Intersection operations to deteriorate from an acceptable level under Existing Conditions to an
        unacceptable level and the traffic volumes at the intersection to increase such that the Peak Hour
        Warrant for traffic signal installation is met; or

    ·   The exacerbation of operations at an unsignalized intersection already operating at an unacceptable level
        under Existing Conditions and the Peak Hour Warrant for traffic signal installation is met under Year 2030
        Current General Plan Plus Project Conditions.

ROADWAY SEGMENT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
Using the 2001 General Plan Circulation Element LOS policies and the significance criteria described above, the
Walnut Grove Driveway extension Alternatives 1 and 2 alignments would not have significant impact to roadway
segments. All City study roadway segments are projected to operate acceptably with the extension.

INTERSECTION IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
Using the 2001 General Plan Circulation Element LOS policies and the significance criteria described above, no
significant impact would be identified at any of the 3 study intersections for each of the project alternatives.

NEIGHBORHOOD TRAFFIC IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
Using the neighborhood traffic significance criteria described above, the Walnut Grove Driveway extension
Alternatives 1 and 2 alignments would not have significant impact to roadway segments. All of the key
neighborhood roadways function as collector streets and are projected to operate acceptably.

PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE, AND TRANSIT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The extension of Walnut Grove Drive would improve connectivity within the neighborhood and establish a more
direct route for pedestrians and bicyclist to/from Dunne Avenue and Diana Avenue. Pedestrians and bicyclists will
benefit from the continuous and complete pedestrian and bicycle facilities provided by the Walnut Grove Drive
extension, which is consistent with Goals 3 and 8 of the 2001 General Plan Circulation Element. Thus, the
Alternative 1 or 2 Walnut Grove Drive extension alignment would result in a beneficial impact to all non-auto
modes.




                                                                                                             28

OTHER IMPROVEMENTS

St. Anthony Drive Extension

St. Anthony Drive is currently a short cul-de-sac street extending just south of Rosemary Circle west of the
proposed future commercial development area. A new public street connection linking St. Anthony Drive to Dunne
Avenue is included as part of a condition of approval for the new residential development in this area. This new
connection would provide an additional vehicle access route between the neighborhood and Dunne Avenue.
Because of the circuitous path for vehicles to use the new connection and Rosemary Circle to travel between
Dunne Avenue and Diana Avenue, the use of the new connection is expected to be limited. However, the new
connection will reduce the amount of traffic that would use the Dunne Avenue/Butterfield Boulevard intersection
and would provide an additional circulation benefit for the overall area and reduce volumes on Diana Avenue
between Butterfield Boulevard and Calle Mazatan.

Neighborhood Traffic Management

To minimize potential impacts to the adjacent neighborhood, neighborhood traffic management measures could
be implemented to ensure that traffic on the key study roadways maintains appropriate travel speeds. Changes in
speed cannot be accurately predicted even with an increase in traffic volume. Measures designed to change
traffic volumes are not considered feasible given the limited number of access opportunities and a desire to not
overburden any individual street segment. The City maintains a neighborhood traffic management program
(NTMP) that delineates the process of requesting and implementing traffic calming measures and devices. This
neighborhood could receive special priority if the planned extension was constructed and a regular monitoring
program could be established if no other actions are taken.

Restricted Access

One potential measure to limit the amount of commercial traffic that would access the neighborhood via the
planned extension is the installation of turn restrictions at the Walnut Grove Drive/Laurel Road intersection.
These restrictions would preclude vehicles on Laurel Road from accessing Walnut Grove Drive to and from the
north through the use of median diverters and signage. However, these restrictions would apply to residents of
the adjacent neighborhood, and residents driving to access the retail areas would have to travel on Butterfield
Boulevard and Dunne Avenue.

SUMMARY OF PROJECT BENEFITS
The planned extension will improve connectivity of the existing roadway network by providing additional travel
options for residents of the study neighborhood. The extension will provide more direct public access to the
existing and planned retail developments on Dunne Avenue south of the neighborhood, as well as to the freeway
interchange. This new public access will help to encourage the use of bicycling and walking by providing a shorter
route that also does not require travel on major roadways such as Butterfield Boulevard and Dunne Avenue. The
new connection will also better link the neighborhoods north and south of Dunne Avenue as envisioned in the
city's General Plan Circulation Element. Emergency access and response times to the neighborhood would be
improved substantially with the extension and would better distribute emergency call volume between the two fire
stations serving this part of the City.

5. YEAR 2030 CUMULATIVE GPA CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the expected traffic operations under Year 2030 Cumulative General Plan Amendment
GPA Conditions with all of the proposed GPAs in place. This scenario includes recommended changes to the
City's roadway network based on the latest travel demand model, plus vehicle trips generated by the new GPA
land uses, as well as changes in travel patterns caused by proposed GPA roadway network changes. The City`s
travel demand forecasting model was used to estimate Year 2030 Cumulative GPA Condition traffic volumes. The
proposed GPA land use and network assumptions are briefly discussed and followed by a more detailed
discussion of the resulting intersection and roadway operations.

ROADWAY NETWORK GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS
The Year 2030 Cumulative GPA roadway network includes the "Model-Recommended Roadway Capacity
General Plan Amendments" discussed in Chapter 4 of the General Plan Circulation Element Network & Policy
Revisions TIA (July 29, 2009). These changes resulted from the evaluation of 2030 traffic volumes and the
identification of locations where the currently approved Circulation Element identified excess lane capacity for
several City roadways. At only one location (Tennant Avenue from Butterfield Boulevard to US 101), the
evaluation showed that additional capacity is needed to meet 2030 demand. In addition, four City-initiated
roadway network amendments were included in the GPA analysis as described below:

    ·   Monterey Road narrowed to a 2-lane arterial between Main Avenue and Dunne Avenue - The Monterey
        Road narrowing removes a northbound and southbound through lane from the intersections at Main
        Avenue/Monterey Road, and Dunne Avenue/Monterey Road. The purpose of this modification is to allow
        for wider sidewalks, increased on-street parking supply, and enhancement of the downtown area as a
        more walkable, bikeable, and transit-friendly environment.

    ·   Removal of the planned Dunne Avenue Grade Separation ­ The current General Plan includes a planned
        grade separation at the Dunne Avenue railroad crossing, which requires the closure of Depot Street at
        Dunne Avenue. However, the existing connection of Depot Street to Dunne Avenue would remain if the
        grade separation is not built. With this proposal, traffic on Dunne Avenue would continue to stop for trains
        as they pass through the City and would continue to experience temporary delays.

    ·   Walnut Grove Extension Realignment (this project) ­ The current alignment would extend from Walnut
        Grove Drive south to Laurel Road. The realignment is proposed to connect to Diana Avenue west of the
        currently planned extension by approximately 1,500 feet.

    ·   San Pedro Avenue ­ Rather than connecting San Pedro Avenue to Spring Avenue as planned in the
        2001 General Plan Circulation Element the proposed amendment maintains existing alignment with
        modifications to intersection control and access on Monterey Road at Spring Avenue and San Pedro
        Avenue.

LAND USE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS (GPAs) AND URBAN SERVICE AREA
AMENDMENTS (USAs)
The City of Morgan Hill provided the following changes in land uses and roadway network based on the pending
GPAs:

    ·   West Hills Community Church USA: Add parcels totaling 8.7 acres into the Urban Service Area and
        replace approximately 11,600 s.f. of church and school space with approximately 20,000 s.f. of the same
        land use.




                                                                                                           30
Walnut Grove Drive Extension Transportation Impact Analysis ­ Draft Report
August 2009


    ·   Peet ­ Trumpp USA: Add 6 acres of single family residences on the west side of Peet Road and north of
        Half Road into the Urban Service Area.

    ·   Monterey ­ Morgan Hill Bible Church GPA and USA: Add parcels totaling 8.7 acres into the Urban
        Service Area and replace approximately 11,600 s.f. of church and school space with approximately
        20,000 s.f. of the same land use.

    ·   Watsonville ­ Royal Oaks GPA and USA: Change one parcel from Single Family Medium (3-5 du/ac) to
        Light Commercial/Residential on 8.19 acres at the southwest corner of Watsonville Road and Monterey
        Road, and change a second parcel from Single Family Medium to Multi-Family Medium (14-21 du/ac) on
        7.5 acres on the Watsonville Road, west of Monterey Road.

    ·   Walnut Grove/Simonsen ­ DeRose Applications (GPA): Amend General Plan Land Use Designation from
        Multi-Family Low and Commercial to 100 percent Commercial. The anticipated square footage for the
        development will be approximately 113,500 s.f.

    ·   Hale-Signature Properties GPA: The proposed GPA will amend 30 vacant acres from Public Facilities to
        Single Family Residential to accommodate approximately 120 units in the Single Family Medium (3-5
        du/acre) designation and/or a new Single Family High (5-10 du/acre) land use designation the City is
        creating in conjunction with its 2009 Housing Element Update. The subject area is bounded by the Union
        Pacific Railroad tracks to the east, residential land use to the south (Campoli Drive) and north (Tarragon
        Avenue), and Hale Avenue to the west.

    ·   Berg & Berg GPA: The proposed GPA will amend approximately 56 acres of Industrial to a combination of
        Commercial and Multi-Family Low, Multi-Family Medium, and the new Single Family High (5-10 du/acre)
        land use designation the City is creating in conjunction with its 2009 Housing Element Update. The
        proposed land uses include approximately 446 small-lot single family residential units (which may be
        "senior housing" but which are analyzed as standard housing units), about 60 apartment units, and about
        25,000 square feet of retail commercial uses. This project is generally bounded by the Union Pacific
        Railroad tracks to the west, Jarvis Drive to the north, Sutter Boulevard to the south, Butterfield Boulevard
        to the east.

    ·   Downtown Specific Plan: This amendment also includes Downtown Redevelopment, Dunne
        Avenue/Depot Street: This application proposes to redevelop the Downtown area with approximately
        1,204 residential units and approximately 186,000 s.f. of retail space relative to existing uses. The
        Downtown area is generally bounded by Depot Street on the east, Dunne Avenue on the south, Del
        Monte Street on the west and Main Avenue on the north.

CUMULATIVE GPA TRAFFIC VOLUMES ESTIMATES
The same forecast method discussed in Chapter 3 was used for the intersection and roadway segments study
locations under Year 2030 Cumulative GPA Conditions. Figure ES 1 shows the daily roadway segment volumes
for each Walnut Grove Drive extension alternative under Year 2030 Cumulative GPA Conditions. While Figure 7
shows the AM and PM peak hour intersection turning movement forecasts volumes for the three (3) study
intersections under Year 2030 Cumulative GPA Conditions for each extension alternative.

CUMULATIVE GPA ROADWAY SEGMENT LEVEL OF SERVICE
Year 2030 Cumulative GPA roadway improvements and daily two-way volumes were used as inputs for the

Walnut Grove Drive Extension Transportation Impact Analysis ­ Draft Report
August 2009


Measured against the City of Morgan Hill LOS standards, none of the roadway segments will operate at an
unacceptable level under daily conditions with the three Walnut Grove Drive extension alternatives in place.
However, Diana Avenue between Butterfield Boulevard and Calle Mazatan will exceed 3,500 daily vehicles per
day without the extension and the current General Plan alignment.

As shown in Table 11, the daily traffic volume on all three north-south streets and Diana Avenue is expected to
increase by 0 to 59 percent with the development of future residential uses without the extension. The volumes on
Grand Prix Way and Serene Drive are projected to increase to 800 and 1,700 vehicles per day, respectively,
which are within the planning capacity of a local residential street with front-on housing of 2,000 vpd. The daily
volume on Calle Mazatan is projected to be approximately 2,200 vpd, which serves some diverted traffic from El
Toro Elementary School. The volume on Diana Avenue without the extension is projected to be 4,400 vpd east of
Butterfield Boulevard, which substantially exceeds the City's target threshold of 3,500 vpd for a residential
collector street.

Relative to the no extension alternative, Alternatives 1 and 2 will increase daily traffic on Serene Drive by 700 vpd
and reduce daily traffic on Diana Avenue by 1,500 vpd (or an approximate decrease of one vehicle every 25
seconds during the peak hour). A portion of the increased traffic is from the improved connectivity and shifting of
existing traffic within the neighborhood. Calle Mazatan and Grand Prix Way total daily volumes are not estimated
to change substantially; however, existing daily traffic will shift to and from the west on Diana Avenue to the
eastern segments with the extension in place. The increase in volume on Serene Drive with the western Walnut
Grove Drive extension alignments (i.e., Alternative 1 or 2) of 700 vehicles per day translates to a potential
increase of one vehicle every 50 seconds during the peak hour. All of the key neighborhood roadways are
expected to serve volumes of less than 2,900 vpd, which is well within the collector street volume threshold. The
current General Plan Walnut Grove Drive alignment will server fewer daily vehicles because it is farther east than
the Alternative 1 and 2 alignments and results in a more circuitous route for much of the traffic from the greater
neighborhood.

The projected volume of 1,600 to 3,100 vpd could easily be accommodated by the planned two-lane Walnut
Grove Drive extension south of Diana Avenue. This section will have adequate capacity for vehicles turning from
intersecting side streets. The provision of left-turn lanes or a two-way center left-turn lane would provide additional
capacity and would further reduce any minor delays on this roadway, but is not required for the roadway to
operate acceptably. In fact, a wider street would likely contribute to faster travel speeds. The fact that the planned
extension will not connect directly opposite Serene Drive will help to discourage through traffic from diverting
through the neighborhood by not representing an "obvious" connection. The extension will greatly improve
vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian access to the commercial area and freeway access for residents of the
neighborhood.

CUMULATIVE GPA INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Year 2030 Cumulative GPA roadway intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak-hour turning
movement volumes were used as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for Year 2030
Cumulative GPA Conditions are presented in Table 12. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation
sheets. Measured against the City's current LOS D+ standard for signalized intersections neither signalized
intersection would operate at an unacceptable LOS E and D during the AM and PM peak hours. Also, the
unsignalized intersection of Dunne Avenue and Laurel Road would operate acceptably (i.e., LOS D or better).

CUMULATIVE GPA IMPACT CRITERIA
As with the Year 2030 Current General Plan Plus Project impacts, the determination of significance for cumulative
impacts is based on applicable policies, regulations, goals, and guidelines defined by the City of Morgan Hill. The
City does not have a formally adopted roadway segment operating standard. The cumulative impact criteria are
identical to the significance criteria presented in Chapter 4. These projects are defined as cumulatively
considerable when the cumulative impact criteria are met between Year 2030 Cumulative GPA Conditions and
Year 2030 Current General Plan Conditions.

ROADWAY SEGMENT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
Using the 2001 General Plan Circulation Element LOS policies and the significance criteria described above, the
Walnut Grove Driveway extension Alternatives 1 and 2 alignments would not have significant cumulative impact
to roadway segments. All City study roadway segments are projected to operate acceptably with the extension.

INTERSECTION IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
Using the 2001 General Plan Circulation Element LOS policies and the significance criteria described in Chapter
4, no significant impact would be identified at any of the 3 study intersections for each of the project alternatives.

NEIGHBORHOOD IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
Using the neighborhood traffic significance criteria described in Chapter 4, the Walnut Grove Driveway extension
Alternatives 1 and 2 alignments would not have significant cumulative impact to roadway segments. All of the key
neighborhood roadways function as collector streets and are projected to operate acceptably.

PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE, AND TRANSIT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The extension of Walnut Grove Drive would improve connectivity within the neighborhood and establish a more
direct route for pedestrians and bicyclist to/from Dunne Avenue and Diana Avenue. Pedestrians and bicyclists will
benefit from the continuous and complete pedestrian and bicycle facilities provided by the Walnut Grove Drive
extension, which is consistent with Goals 3 and 8 of the 2001 General Plan Circulation Element. Thus, the
Alternative 1 or 2 Walnut Grove Drive extension alignment would result in a beneficial impact to all non-auto
modes.




                                                                                                                                         36

OTHER IMPROVEMENTS

St. Anthony Drive Extension

St. Anthony Drive is currently a short cul-de-sac street extending just south of Rosemary Circle west of the
proposed future commercial development area. A new public street connection linking St. Anthony Drive to Dunne
Avenue is included as part of a condition of approval for the new residential development in this area. This new
connection would provide an additional vehicle access route between the neighborhood and Dunne Avenue.
Because of the circuitous path for vehicles to use the new connection and Rosemary Circle to travel between
Dunne Avenue and Diana Avenue, the use of the new connection is expected to be limited. However, the new
connection will reduce the amount of traffic that would use the Dunne Avenue/Butterfield Boulevard intersection
and would provide an additional circulation benefit for the overall area and reduce volumes on Diana Avenue
between Butterfield Boulevard and Calle Mazatan.

Neighborhood Traffic Management

To minimize potential impacts to the adjacent neighborhood, neighborhood traffic management measures could
be implemented to ensure that traffic on the key study roadways maintains appropriate travel speeds. Changes in
speed cannot be accurately predicted even with an increase in traffic volume. Measures designed to change
traffic volumes are not considered feasible given the limited number of access opportunities and a desire to not
overburden any individual street segment. The City maintains a neighborhood traffic management program
(NTMP) that delineates the process of requesting and implementing traffic calming measures and devices. This
neighborhood could receive special priority if the planned extension was constructed and a regular monitoring
program could be established if no other actions are taken.

Restricted Access

One potential measure to limit the amount of commercial traffic that would access the neighborhood via the
planned extension is the installation of turn restrictions at the Walnut Grove Drive/Laurel Road intersection.
These restrictions would preclude vehicles on Laurel Road from accessing Walnut Grove Drive to and from the
north through the use of median diverters and signage. However, these restrictions would apply to residents of
the adjacent neighborhood, and residents driving to access the retail areas would have to travel on Butterfield
Boulevard and Dunne Avenue.

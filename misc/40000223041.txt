                           TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS


I.   INTRODUCTION

This report summarizes traffic impacts related to the Unitarian Church Property project.
The general goals of this impact study concentrate on 1) the assessment of existing
roadway conditions and intersection congestion, 2) forecasts of newly generated project
traffic, 3) estimations of future delay, and 4) recommendations for mitigation.
Preliminary tasks include the detailed collection of roadway information, road
improvement information, and peak hour traffic counts. A level of service analysis for
existing traffic conditions is then made to determine the present degree of intersection
congestion. Based on this analysis, forecasts of future traffic levels on the surrounding
street system are found. Following this forecast, the future service levels for the key
intersections are investigated. As a final step, applicable conclusions and possible on-site
or off-site mitigation measures are defined. The findings of this study are intended to
ensure safe and efficient progression of vehicular/non-motorist traffic near the site.


II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The proposed project is an apartment complex that will consist of ten apartment buildings
totaling 136 dwelling units. Also on site will be an office/recreation center building that
will serve on site residents and is considered ancillary space. The site is located on the
west side of Orchard Street, just north of the SR-16 on/off ramps between 12th Street
19th Street. Access to the site will be provided by one new entrance onto Orchard Street.
Surrounding development is primarily residential. Figure 1, on the following page shows
the general site location along with the local street network. The site plan is given in
Figure 2.


III. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A. Surrounding Roadway System

Roadways serving the proposed site consist of multi-lane arterials and two-lane collector
roads which vary in width, terrain, and posted speeds. As indicated by their specific
arterial designations, these roadways also vary in their overall function as part of the
general network. The key streets near the site are described on page 6.




                                             3

South Orchard Street is a north-south, two-to-multilane arterial that borders the east side
of the site and will provide primary access for project residents. The speed limit along
this road varies from 30 to 35 mph. Lane widths are around 12 feet and paving is asphalt
concrete. Shoulders are a mix of curb, gutter, and sidewalks sections and paved/gravel in
other areas. Grades along this road range from 0 to 3 percent.

B. Existing Peak Hour Volumes and Patterns

Field data for this study was collected in April of 2014. Traffic counts were taken during
the evening peak period between the hours of 4 PM and 6 PM. This specific peak period
was targeted for analysis purposes since it generally represents the worst case scenario
with respect to traffic conditions for residential projects. This is primarily due to the
common 8 AM to 5 PM work schedule and the greater number of personal trips occurring
after work hours. Most commuters return to their dwellings at the same time of day
which translates to a natural peak in intersection traffic loads, especially when combined
with the relatively large number of personal trips. Figure 3 on the following page shows
the weekday PM peak volumes for the key intersections of Orchard Street & 12th Street
and Orchard Street & the SR-16 NB on/off ramps.

C. Roadway Improvements

A review of a current City of Tacoma 6-Year Comprehensive Transportation Program
indicates that City improvements are planned near the site. Orchard Street is scheduled
for improvements from 6th Avenue to S 16th Street. According to the project description
this construction project will include: complete street concepts incorporating, curb and
gutter, bike lanes, pedestrian islands, sidewalk, curb ramps, asphalt pavement, storm
drainage, street lighting, landscaping, and traffic control. The cost of this project is
estimated at $6,289,000.

D. Existing Level of Service

Existing peak hour delays were determined through the use of the Highway Capacity
Manual. Capacity analysis is used to determine level of service (LOS) which is an
established measure of congestion for transportation facilities. LOS is defined for a
variety of facilities including intersections, freeways, arterials, etc. A complete definition
of level of service and related criteria can be found in the HCM.

The methodology for determining the LOS at signalized intersections strives to determine
the volume to capacity (/c) ratios for the various intersection movements as well as the
average control delay for those movements. Delay is generally used to measure the
degree of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and lost time. Control delay,
in particular, includes movements at slower speeds and stops on intersection approaches
as vehicles move up in queue position or slow down upstream of an intersection. Aside
from the overall quantity of traffic, three specific factors influence signalized intersection
LOS. These include the type of signal operation provided, the signal phasing pattern, and
the specific allocation of green time.




                                              6
7
The methodology for determining the LOS at unsignalized intersections strives to
determine the potential capacities for the various vehicle movements and ultimately
determines the average total delay for each movement. Potential Capacity represents the
number of additional vehicles that could effectively utilize a particular movement, which
is essentially the equivalent of the difference between the movement capacity and the
existing movement volume. Total delay is described as the elapsed time from when a
vehicle stops at the end of a queue until the vehicle departs from the stop line. Average
total delay is simply the mean total delay over the entire stream. A number of factors
influence potential capacity and total delay including the availability/usefulness of gaps.

The range for intersection level of service is LOS A to LOS F with the former indicating
the best operating conditions with low control delays and the latter indicating the worst
conditions with heavy control delays. Existing LOS for the PM peak hour is shown in
Table 1. This analysis involved the Synchro 8 intersection analysis program. Note that
the analysis assumes activation of the exclusive pedestrian phase at the Orchard & SR-16
ramp intersection; typical delays at the intersection would be lower with the pedestrian
phase not called. As shown in the table, existing delays are mild in the LOS A to LOS C
range.

E. Public Transit

A review of the Pierce Transit regional bus schedule shows transit service is provided to
the Unitarian Church Property area. Pierce Transit Routes 2 and 28 serve in the vicinity
of the site. Route 2 runs from the Lakewood Transit Center to Downtown Tacoma from
5:45 AM o 11:03 PM with stops along 19th Street. Route 28 runs from the TCC Transit
Center to the Downtown area. Service is provided between 6:45 AM to 8:38 PM with
stops along 12th Street. No deductions were made to trip generation values based on
transit usage to remain conservative with analysis.




                                              8
F. Sight Distance at Access Driveways

Access to the site will be provided by one entrance driveway onto Orchard Street.
Preliminary measurements were taken at this access point to verify sight distance
requirements. AASHTO standards require 390 feet of entering sight distance for the 35
mph design speed found on Orchard Street. Sight distance was measured to 500 feet in
both directions at the project entrance. Vertical curvature becomes the limiting factor to
the north.


IV. FUTURE TRAFFIC DEMAND

A. Trip Generation

Trip generation is used to determine the magnitude of project impacts on the surrounding
street system. Data presented in this report was taken from the Institute of Transportation
Engineer's publication Trip Generation, Ninth Edition. The ITE designated land use for
this project is defined as Apartments (LUC 220). Data for the 4 PM to 6 PM peak hour
was used for future traffic estimations and LOS calculations. Table 2 below gives a
summary of the estimated project trip generation. Included are the average weekday
volumes and the AM and PM peak hour volumes. As shown, during the critical PM peak
hour the project will generate 60 inbound trips and 32 outbound trips.

                                       TABLE 2
                                 Project Trip Generation

B. Trip Assignment and Distribution

The destination and origination of the generated traffic primarily influences the project
entrances and the key intersections which would effectively receive the majority of
project related traffic. Site generated trips are expected to follow the pattern shown in
Figure 4 on the following page. The figure reflects work-based and home-based trips
taken by project traffic during the PM peak hour. As shown in the figure, traffic is likely
to split along a number of paths. These percentages are estimated based on existing travel
patterns and the location of nearby major roadways.

C. Future Traffic Volumes With and Without the Project

A horizon year of 2016 was chosen for the future study period. The future 2016 traffic
volumes without the project were derived by applying a 1 percent annual growth rate
through the year 2016 to the existing traffic volumes shown in Figure 3. This rate of
growth is based on forecasted growth for the area. Much of the land in the area is already
developed limiting the amount of traffic growth as new projects develop. Future volumes
without project traffic included are shown in Figure 5. Future 2016 volumes with project
traffic are shown in Figure 6.

D. Future Level of Service

Level of service analyses were made of the future PM peak hour volumes without and
with trips from the project added to the key roadways and intersections. This analysis
once again involved the use the Synchro analysis program for intersection analysis.
Delays for the key intersections under future conditions are shown below in Table 3.
Analysis of the project entrance assumes a northbound to westbound left turn lane on
Orchard Street (see Part F).

The results of Table 3 show that future delays at the key intersections studied will remain
mild at LOS C or better. The project is shown to cause no increase in LOS, only minor
delays are expected. The project entrances will operate with mild delays at LOS B or
better.

E. Queues

An investigation of queues was made to determine if the project access would have any
interference from or to the Orchard & SR-16 ramp intersection for 2016 PM peak hour
volumes with the project. The LOS output for Orchard Street at the project entrance



                                               13
shows northbound 95th percentile queues of less than 1 vehicle length, with or without
the northbound left turn lane added. A simulation run using SimTraffic shows that the
northbound to westbound turn into the site would easily make the turn without hindering
through traffic. In addition, southbound 95th percentile queues on Orchard Street at SR-
16 would be relatively low at 72 feet. The project entrance is located roughly 260 feet to
the north from the stop bar, indicating no interference from southbound queues.

F. Left Turn Warrants

Left turn lanes are a means of providing necessary storage space for left turning vehicles
at intersections. For a two-lane or four-lane arterial with no left turn storage, delays are
often created by vehicles waiting to complete the desired left turn movement. These
turning vehicles typically block the heavier through movement, thereby causing some
disruption to traffic flow and subsequent congestion. Methods have been developed by
various agencies to determine under what circumstances a left turn lane would be needed.
For this impact study, procedures described by WSDOT Design Manual (Exhibit 1310-
7a) were used to ascertain storage requirements on Orchard Street at the project entrance.
The results of these assessments indicate that a left turn lane would be warranted at the
project entrance on Orchard Street based on 2016 PM peak hour volumes with project
traffic. Refer to the appendix for the corresponding inputs and figures.


V.   CONCLUSIONS AND MITIGATION

The project proposes to construct ten buildings that will support a total of 136 apartment
units. The project is located on the northwest corner of the Orchard Street & the SR-16
on/off ramp intersection. Access will be provided by one new entrance onto Orchard
Street. Roughly 948 total daily trips are expected to be generated on a typical weekday
with 70 trips during the AM peak hour and 92 trips during the PM peak hour.

Existing delays at the studied intersections are mild in the LOS A to LOS C range. Future
2016 delays, shown in Table 3, will remain in the LOS A to LOS C range both without
and with project traffic. Overall, the project is not expected to have any significant
impact on the surrounding roadway system. A left turn lane will be warranted based on
2016 PM peak hour traffic volumes at the project entrance on Orchard Street. Queues at
the project entrance and at the Orchard & SR-16 NB ramp intersection should not
interfere with traffic operations at either intersection.

Based on the above, proposed mitigation for the Unitarian Church Property project would
be to construct a left turn lane on Orchard Street at the project entrance. All design and
construction must be to City of Tacoma standards. Further widening for the northbound
through lanes, which currently taper from 2 lanes to 1 lane in this vicinity, should not be
needed.

                                   LEVEL OF SERVICE


The following are excerpts from the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation
Research Board Special Report 209.

Quality of service requires quantitative measures to characterize operational conditions
within a traffic stream. Level of service (LOS) is a quality measure describing
operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally in terms of such service measures
as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and comfort and
convenience.

Six LOS are defined for each type of facility that has analysis procedures available.
Letters designate each level, from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating
conditions and LOS F the worst. Each level of service represents a range of operating
conditions and the driver's perception of those conditions.

Level-of-Service definitions

The following definitions generally define the various levels of service for arterials.

Level of service A represents primarily free-flow operations at average travel speeds,
usually about 90 percent of the free-flow speed for the arterial classification. Vehicles are
seldom impeded in their ability to maneuver in the traffic stream. Delay at signalized
intersections is minimal.

Level of service B represents reasonably unimpeded operations at average travel speeds,
usually about 70 percent of the free-flow speed for the arterial classification. The ability
to maneuver in the traffic stream is only slightly restricted and delays are not bothersome.

Level of service C represents stable operations; however, ability to maneuver and change
lanes in midblock locations may be more restricted than in LOS B, and longer queues,
adverse signal coordination, or both may contribute to lower average travel speeds of
about 50 percent of the average free-flow speed for the arterial classification.

Level of service D borders on a range in which small increases in flow may cause
substantial increases in approach delay and hence decreases in arterial speed. LOS D may
be due to adverse signal progression, inappropriate signal timing, high volumes, or some
combination of these. Average travel speeds are about 40 percent of free-flow speed.

Level of service E is characterized by significant delays and average travel speeds of one-
third the free-flow speed or less. Such operations are caused by some combination of
adverse progression, high signal density, high volumes, extensive delays at critical
intersections, and inappropriate signal timing.




                                             16
Level of service F characterizes arterial flow at extremely low speeds, from less than one-
third to one-quarter of the free-flow speed. Intersection congestion is likely at critical
signalized locations, with long delays and extensive queuing.

These definitions are general and conceptual in nature, and they apply primarily to
uninterrupted flow. Levels of service for interrupted flow facilities vary widely in terms
of both the user's perception of service quality and the operational variables used to
describe them.

For each type of facility, levels of service are defined based on one or more operational
parameters that best describe operating quality for the subject facility type. While the
concept of level of service attempts to address a wide range of operating conditions,
limitations on data collection and availability make it impractical to treat the full range of
operational parameters for every type of facility. The parameters selected to define levels
of service for each facility type are called "measures of effectiveness" or "MOE's", and
represent available measures that best describe the quality of operation on the subject
facility type.

Each level of service represents a range of conditions, as defined by a range in the
parameters given. Thus, a level of service is not a discrete condition, but rather a range of
conditions for which boundaries are established.

The following tables describe levels of service for signalized and unsignalized
intersections. Level of service for signalized intersections is defined in terms of average
control delay. Delay is a measure of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption and
lost travel time, as well as time from movements at slower speeds and stops on
intersection approaches as vehicles move up in queue position or slow down upstream of
an intersection. Level of service for unsignalized intersections is determined by the
computed or measured control delay and is determined for each minor movement.

As described in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, level of service breakpoints for all-
way stop controlled (AWSC) intersections are somewhat different than the criteria used
for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is that drivers expect
different levels of performance from distinct kinds of transportation facilities. The
expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes
than an AWSC intersection. Thus a higher level of control delay is acceptable at a
signalized intersection for the same level of service.

Mr. Wise:

EcoCon, Inc. (ECI) at the request of Mr. John Wise, Wise Real Estate Investments, Inc., completed an
environmental investigation focusing on potential Arsenic and Lead impacted near surface soils as a
result of the Asarco Smelter Plum. This investigation was conducted on three proposed building sites
located on portions of Pierce County Parcels Pierce County Parcels 4475000390, 4475000380, and
4475000733 located in Tacoma, Washington (Subject Properties / Site  Figures 1-3).

According to the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology), the Site is located within the Tacoma
Asarco Smelter Plume (Smelter Plume)1. The City of Tacoma has required that the Subject Properties be
assessed for Arsenic and Lead contamination related to the Asarco Smelter Plume. Ecology provides
sampling guidelines that stipulate soil sampling requirements, provided in Attachment D.

Soil Sampling Activities
The goal of this project was to comply with the City of Tacoma and Ecology surface soil sampling
requirements. The soil sampling methodology includes the collection of soil samples at three elevations,
forested surface materials (Duff), near surface soil at 0-6" below ground surface (bgs) and 6-12" bgs.
Ecology requested three samples be collected below the stockpiled soil on the subject Site. These
samples were not collected as part of this sampling event.

ECI completed sampling activities at the Subject Site on February 24, 2014. Thirty-four sample locations
were randomly selected, eighteen on parcel 4475000390, six on parcel 4475000380 and ten on parcel
4475000733 (Figures 4-12). Fifty-one samples were collected, nine Duff samples, thirty three zero to six
inch samples and nine 6 to 12 inch samples.

Each discrete soil sample was collected by a properly trained sampling technician using appropriately
decontaminated sampling equipment. Each soil sample was placed into new laboratory provided
sampling containers and labeled using a unique sample identification number. Samples were delivered
under industry standard chain of custody to Freidman & Bruya, Inc., an Ecology accredited laboratory for
chemical analysis.

Regulatory Compliance
Regulatory compliance for this project is based on the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173-340
 Model Toxic Control Act (MTCA) - chapter 70.105D RCW and is regulated by Ecology. Ecology has
established cleanup standards and requirements for the cleanup actions. The rules establishing these
standards and requirements were developed by Ecology in consultation with the Science Advisory Board
(established under the Act) and with representatives from local government, citizen, environmental, and
business groups. The rules were first published in February 1991, with amendments in January 1996,
February 2001, and October 2007.

The applicable soil cleanup levels (CUL) for the contaminants of concern (COC) are guided by Ecology's
MTCA-173-340: Table 740-1 Method A Soil Cleanup Levels for Unrestricted Land Uses. The COCs for this
project are Arsenic with a CUL of 20 mg/kg and Lead with a CUL of 250 mg/kg.

Laboratory Analysis
Soil samples were analyzed for Total Arsenic (As) and Total Lead (Pb) by EPA Method 200.8 (Attachment
C  Laboratory Results). Twenty-three samples were reported exceeding the 20 mg/kg Arsenic cleanup
level, and two samples were reported exceeding the 250 mg/kg Lead cleanup level.

The remaining samples were reported below the Arsenic and Lead cleanup levels. Concentration of
Arsenic ranged from 20.1 mg/kg to 74.2 mg/kg with an average of 40.5 mg/kg. (Attachment B -Project
Tables - Table 1 - Soil Sample Results - Total Arsenic & Lead).

Summary
Based on soil sample analysis, soil impacted with arsenic exceeding the MTCA-A cleanup limit of 20
mg/kg was identified at twenty-three (23) of the thirty-four (34) sample locations. Twelve of fifteen 0-6"
sample locations (S10-6", S12-6", S13-6", S14-6", S16-6", S17-6", S18-6", S20-6", S21-6", S24-6", S25-6",
S27-6") and three of six 6-12" sample locations (S15-12", S19-12", S23-12") will need additional sampling
to delineate the extent of arsenic impacted soil. Samples S13-Duff and S25-Duff were reported

containing 253 and 283 mg/kg Lead respectively. Sample collected directly below these two samples,
S13-6" and S25-6", were each reported containing Lead at 75.5 and 92.2 mg/kg respectively, below the
250 mg/kg cleanup level. No further lead assessment is deemed necessary at this time.

In order to develop the sites, the arsenic impacted soil will need to be addressed. Remediation or
mitigation of the impacted soil can be incorporated into the development of the property. However, a
work plans incorporating the required additional investigation work and addressing the proposed
corrective action will need to be completed and approved by Ecology prior to implementation to
eliminate construction delays. Ecologies publication Tacoma Smelter Plume Model Remedies Guidance,
Publication Number 12-09-086-A provides specific technical guidance on Arsenic and Lead remediation.

Opinion
Further sampling is recommended to delineate the vertical extent of impacted soil. Using the Tacoma
Smelter Plume Model Remedies Guidance, the site currently meets soil mixing / dilution alternative
approved by Ecology. The requirements for this alternative are that Arsenic averages are below 40
mg/kg and Lead Averages be below 500 mg/kg. The Subject Sites current Arsenic averages are Duff:
31.0 mg/kg, 0-6": 24.1 mg/kg and 6-12": 19.8 mg/kg. Lead averages are Duff: 88.1.0 mg/kg, 0-6": 52.0
mg/kg and 6-12": 43.5 mg/kg. However, since the vertical extent of impacted soil has not been fully
delineated, the Arsenic averages will fluctuate following additional sampling and may end up above the
40 mg/kg threshold. Although this is a possibility, we consider it unlikely.

Re:       Supplemental Arsenic & Lead Soil Investigation
          Pierce County Parcels 4475000390, 4475000380, and 4475000733
          Tacoma, Washington

Mr. Wise:

EcoCon, Inc. (ECI) at the request of Mr. John Wise, Wise Real Estate Investments, Inc., completed a
supplemental environmental investigation focusing on the extent of Arsenic and Lead impacted near
surface soils as a result of the Asarco Smelter Plum. This investigation was conducted on two proposed
building sites located on portions of Pierce County Parcels 4475000390, 4475000380, and 4475000733
located in Tacoma, Washington (Subject Properties  Figures 1-3).

Soil Sampling Activities
The goal of this supplemental project was to further delineate the extent of the arsenic contamination
on parcels 4475000390, 4475000380, and 4475000733. The results of the previous sampling event on
February 24, 2014, identified twenty-three locations exceeding the 20 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg)
Model Toxic Cleanup Program (MTCA) cleanup levels. These locations were resampled at six inch
intervals to the maximum depth of twenty-four inches in order to discern the extent of the arsenic
contamination.

ECI completed sampling activities at the Subject Site on March 20, 2014, April 11, 2014, and April 14,
2014. Sixteen sample locations were selected to identify the depth of the arsenic contamination based
upon the previous sampling event on February 24, 2014, twelve on parcel 4475000390 and four on
parcel 4475000733 (Figures 3). Twenty samples were collected in all, thirteen 6 to 12 inch samples, six
12 to 18 inch samples, and one 18 to 24 inch samples.

Each discrete soil sample was collected by a properly trained sampling technician using appropriately
decontaminated sampling equipment. Each soil sample was placed into new laboratory provided
sampling containers and labeled using a unique sample identification number. Samples were delivered
under industry standard chain of custody to Freidman & Bruya, Inc., an Ecology accredited laboratory for
chemical analysis.

Regulatory Compliance
Regulatory compliance for this project is based on the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173-340
 Model Toxic Control Act (MTCA) - chapter 70.105D RCW and is regulated by Ecology. Ecology has
established cleanup standards and requirements for the cleanup actions. The rules establishing these
standards and requirements were developed by Ecology in consultation with the Science Advisory Board
(established under the Act) and with representatives from local government, citizen, environmental, and
business groups. The rules were first published in February 1991, with amendments in January 1996,
February 2001, and October 2007.

The applicable soil cleanup levels (CUL) for the contaminants of concern (COC) are guided by Ecology's
MTCA-173-340: Table 740-1 Method A Soil Cleanup Levels for Unrestricted Land Uses. The COCs for this
project tare Arsenic with a CUL of 20 mg/kg and Lead with a CUL of 250 mg/kg.

Laboratory Analysis
Soil samples were analyzed for Total Arsenic (As) and Total Lead (Pb) by Method 200.8 (Attachment C 
Laboratory Results). Four samples were reported exceeding the 20 mg/kg Arsenic cleanup level, and
two samples were reported exceeding the 250 mg/kg Lead cleanup level.

The remaining samples were reported below the Arsenic and Lead cleanup levels. Concentration of
Arsenic ranged from 22.1 mg/kg to 33.3 mg/kg. (Attachment B - Project Tables - Table 1 - Soil Sample
Results - Total Arsenic & Lead).

Summary
Based on soil sample analysis, soil impacted with arsenic exceeding the MTCA-A cleanup limit of 20
mg/kg was identified at four (4) of the twenty (20) sample locations. Two of the 6-12" sample locations
(S10-12", S12-12"), one of the 12-18" sample location (S10-18"), and one of the 18-24" sample locations
(S10-24"). Samples collected directly below samples, S12-12", was reported containing arsenic 13.4 and
lead at 25.4, below the 20 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg respective cleanup levels. Sample location S10 will
require further analysis to determine the extent of the contamination.

In order to develop the sites, the arsenic impacted soil will need to be addressed. Remediation or
mitigation of the impacted soil can be incorporated into the development of the property. However, a
work plans incorporating the required additional investigation work and addressing the proposed
corrective action will need to be completed and approved by Ecology prior to implementation to
eliminate construction delays. Ecologies publication Tacoma Smelter Plume Model Remedies Guidance,
Publication Number 12-09-086-A provides specific technical guidance on Arsenic and Lead remediation.

Opinion
The requirements for using the soil mixing this alternative are that Arsenic averages are below 40 mg/kg
and Lead Averages be below 500 mg/kg. The Subject Sites current Arsenic averages are Duff: 31.0
mg/kg, 0-6": 24.2 mg/kg, 6-12": 15.7 mg/kg, 12-18": 11.4 mg/kg and 18-24": 23.7 mg/kg. Lead averages
are Duff: 94.9 mg/kg, 0-6": 53.4 mg/kg, 6-12": 34.4 mg/kg, 12-18": 23.3 mg/kg and 18-24": 46.0 mg/kg.
ECI appreciates the opportunity to provide environmental services on this project. The competition of a
Cleanup Action Plan and entrance into the Voluntary Cleanup Program are recommended if regulatory
closure is required for this project.

                               Data Qualifiers & Definitions
a - The analyte was detected at a level less than five times the reporting limit. The RPD results may not
provide reliable information on the variability of the analysis.
A1  More than one compound of similar molecule structure was identified with equal probability.
b - The analyte was spiked at a level that was less than five times that present in the sample. Matrix spike
recoveries may not be meaningful.
ca - The calibration results for this range fell outside of acceptance criteria. The value reported is an
estimate.
c - The presence of the analyte indicated may be due to carryover from previous sample injections.
d - The sample was diluted. Detection limits may be raised due to dilution.
ds - The sample was diluted. Detection limits are raised due to dilution and surrogate recoveries may not be
meaningful.
dv - Insufficient sample was available to achieve normal reporting limits and limits are raised accordingly.
fb - Analyte present in the blank and the sample.
fc  The compound is a common laboratory and field contaminant.
hr - The sample and duplicate were reextracted and reanalyzed. RPD results were still outside of control
limits. The variability is attributed to sample inhomogeneity.
ht - Analysis performed outside the method or client-specified holding time requirement.
ip - Recovery fell outside of normal control limits. Compounds in the sample matrix interfered with the
quantitation of the analyte.
j  The result is below normal reporting limits. The value reported is an estimate.
J - The internal standard associated with the analyte is out of control limits. The reported concentration is
an estimate.
jl - The analyte result in the laboratory control sample is out of control limits. The reported concentration
should be considered an estimate.
jr - The rpd result in laboratory control sample associated with the analyte is out of control limits. The
reported concentration should be considered an estimate.
js - The surrogate associated with the analyte is out of control limits. The reported concentration should be
considered an estimate.
lc - The presence of the compound indicated is likely due to laboratory contamination.
L - The reported concentration was generated from a library search.
nm - The analyte was not detected in one or more of the duplicate analyses. Therefore, calculation of the
RPD is not applicable.
pc  The sample was received in a container not approved by the method. The value reported should be
considered an estimate.
pr  The sample was received with incorrect preservation. The value reported should be considered an
estimate.
ve - Estimated concentration calculated for an analyte response above the valid instrument calibration
range. A dilution is required to obtain an accurate quantification of the analyte.
vo - The value reported fell outside the control limits established for this analyte.
x - The sample chromatographic pattern does not resemble the fuel standard used for quantitation.

                               Data Qualifiers & Definitions
a - The analyte was detected at a level less than five times the reporting limit. The RPD results may not
provide reliable information on the variability of the analysis.
A1  More than one compound of similar molecule structure was identified with equal probability.
b - The analyte was spiked at a level that was less than five times that present in the sample. Matrix spike
recoveries may not be meaningful.
ca - The calibration results for this range fell outside of acceptance criteria. The value reported is an
estimate.
c - The presence of the analyte indicated may be due to carryover from previous sample injections.
d - The sample was diluted. Detection limits may be raised due to dilution.
ds - The sample was diluted. Detection limits are raised due to dilution and surrogate recoveries may not be
meaningful.
dv - Insufficient sample was available to achieve normal reporting limits and limits are raised accordingly.
fb - Analyte present in the blank and the sample.
fc  The compound is a common laboratory and field contaminant.
hr - The sample and duplicate were reextracted and reanalyzed. RPD results were still outside of control
limits. The variability is attributed to sample inhomogeneity.
ht - Analysis performed outside the method or client-specified holding time requirement.
ip - Recovery fell outside of normal control limits. Compounds in the sample matrix interfered with the
quantitation of the analyte.
j  The result is below normal reporting limits. The value reported is an estimate.
J - The internal standard associated with the analyte is out of control limits. The reported concentration is
an estimate.
jl - The analyte result in the laboratory control sample is out of control limits. The reported concentration
should be considered an estimate.
jr - The rpd result in laboratory control sample associated with the analyte is out of control limits. The
reported concentration should be considered an estimate.
js - The surrogate associated with the analyte is out of control limits. The reported concentration should be
considered an estimate.
lc - The presence of the compound indicated is likely due to laboratory contamination.
L - The reported concentration was generated from a library search.
nm - The analyte was not detected in one or more of the duplicate analyses. Therefore, calculation of the
RPD is not applicable.
pc  The sample was received in a container not approved by the method. The value reported should be
considered an estimate.
pr  The sample was received with incorrect preservation. The value reported should be considered an
estimate.
ve - Estimated concentration calculated for an analyte response above the valid instrument calibration
range. A dilution is required to obtain an accurate quantification of the analyte.
vo - The value reported fell outside the control limits established for this analyte.
x - The sample chromatographic pattern does not resemble the fuel standard used for quantitation.

Introduction

The following represents the traffic study completed for the construction of the Elmshade
Residential Development, a proposed 71-lot single-family home development on the west side of
North Street, approximately 1,300 feet north of the North Street/South Main Street intersection in
Bellingham, Massachusetts. Access for the proposed development is currently planned at two
locations, directly on North Street and with an extension of Blackstone Street at Maddie Way.
The majority of the site is currently zoned as agricultural, with a small section that is zoned as
Business I.

Presented within are existing conditions in the vicinity of the project site, a safety analysis of the
study area, an analysis of the traffic based on existing, future 2018 no-build and future 2018 build
conditions, and proposed mitigation measures, where required. Analysis and report preparation
has been completed in accordance with the Bellingham Planning Board Rules and Regulations for
Development Traffic Impact and Analysis Study. A locus map of the study area is provided in
Figure 1 and a conceptual plan for the site is provided in Figure 2.


Data Collection

Manual turning movement counts were completed at the intersections of North Street with
Blackstone Street, North Street with South Main Street, South Main Street with Blackstone
Street, and Blackstone Street with Saddleback Hill Road on Wednesday and Thursday, June 6 and
7, 2012 from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Copies of all count data are
provided in Appendix A.

MassDOT crash data for the roadway network in the vicinity of the project site was reviewed for
the years 2009-2011, the most recent three years available.

A field review of the area was conducted, with geometric measurements and other field
observations recorded at the significant intersections and roadways in the vicinity of the project
site that provide access. The information obtained was used in the analysis of the study area
intersections.

The Town of Bellingham Planning Department was contacted to determine additional projects
within the Town whose trip generation should be included as background growth in the
completion of this study. A number of nearby projects were identified and included as part of the
future no-build analysis.




                                                 -1-
Existing Roadway Conditions

The study area is defined as the significant roadways and intersections in the vicinity of the
proposed site that may be impacted by the traffic due to the construction of the proposed Elmshade
Residential Development. Included in the study area for the proposed development are the
intersections of North Street with Blackstone Street, Blackstone Street with Maddie Way, North
Street with South Main Street, South Main Street with Blackstone Street, and Blackstone Street
with Saddleback Hill Road. Also included is the intersection of North Street with the proposed site
entrance.

North Street and Blackstone Street
The intersection of North Street with Blackstone Street forms a four-legged unsignalized
intersection. North Street runs in a north/south direction and Blackstone Street runs in an
east/west direction. Blackstone Street is stop-controlled at the intersection, and North Street
operates uncontrolled. North Street is classified as an Urban Collector and Blackstone Street is
classified as a Local Roadway. On the northbound and southbound approaches to the
intersection, North Street has one 11-foot travel lane in each direction separated by a solid double
yellow line. The eastbound and westbound approaches to the intersection on Blackstone Street
have one 10-foot travel lane in each direction separated by a solid double yellow line. There are
no marked shoulders on either roadway. The posted speed limit on North Street is 25 miles per
hour, and no posted speed limit was observed on Blackstone Street in the vicinity of the
intersection.

Blackstone Street and Maddie Way
Blackstone Street intersects Maddie Way at a horizontal curve in the roadway. Blackstone Street
terminates at the curve, with a 16-foot dirt trail visible opposite Blackstone Street west of Maddie
Way. Maddie Way runs in a north/south direction at the intersection, and Blackstone Street runs
in an east/west direction approaching the curve. The intersection operates uncontrolled, although
it is likely that motorists traveling on either roadway would be required to slow down to navigate
the turn. On the approach to the intersection, Maddie Way is approximately 26 feet wide with no
visible pavement markings. Blackstone Street approaching the intersection is approximately 18
feet wide with no visible pavement markings. At the curve, Blackstone Street is approximately
20 feet wide. Neither roadway has a posted speed limit.

North Street and South Main Street
The intersection of North Street and South Main Street forms a three-legged unsignalized
intersection. North Street runs in a north/south direction and South Main Street runs in an
east/west direction. North Street is stop-controlled at the intersection and South Main Street
operates uncontrolled. The southbound approach to the intersection, on North Street, has one 12-
foot travel lane in each direction separated by a solid double yellow line. South Main Street has
one13-foot travel lanes and a 3-foot shoulder in each direction separated by a solid double yellow
line. Sidewalk is installed on the northern side of South Main Street with a marked crosswalk
across the North Street approach. The posted speed limit on North Street is 25 miles per hour and
the posted speed limit on South Main Street is 35 miles per hour.

South Main Street and Blackstone Street
The intersection of South Main Street and Blackstone Street forms a four-legged signalized
intersection. South Main Street runs in a north/south direction, and Blackstone Street runs in an
east/west direction. The northbound approach to the intersection on South Main Street has an 11-
foot through and left turn lane, an 11-foot designated right turn lane, and a 1-foot shoulder



                                                -4-
northbound, with a 12-foot travel lane and 1-foot shoulder southbound. Directional traffic on this
approach is separated by a 13-foot striped median. The southbound approach to the intersection,
on South Main Street, has an 11-foot designated left turn lane, an 11-foot shared through and
right turn lane, and a 2-foot shoulder southbound with an 11-foot travel lane and 2-foot shoulder
northbound. The eastbound approach to the intersection on Blackstone Street has one 11-foot
travel lane and a 1-foot shoulder in each direction separated by a solid double yellow line. The
westbound approach to the intersection on Blackstone Street has a designated 11-foot left turn
lane, an 11-foot shared through and right turn lane, and a 2-foot shoulder westbound, with an 11-
foot travel lane and 2-foot shoulder eastbound.

The entrance to Bellingham Memorial Middle School is located on the southeast corner of the
intersection with an entrance approximately 200 feet east of Blackstone Street. An additional
"buses only" entrance is located approximately 400 feet south of the intersection on South Main
Street. Crosswalks are installed at the intersection across the northbound approach on South
Main Street and the westbound approach on Blackstone Street with pedestrian signals and push
buttons located at the terminal ends of the crosswalks. Sidewalk is installed on all corners of the
intersection except the northwest corner. Flashing speed limit signs for a 20 mile per hour school
speed limit are installed along South Main Street on both the northbound and southbound
approaches and are accompanied by additional warning signs for school zones. While the signs
are not operating, the speed limit on South Main Street is 35 miles per hour.

Blackstone Street and Saddleback Hill Road
The intersection of Blackstone Street and Saddleback Hill Road forms a three-legged
unsignalized intersection. Blackstone Street generally runs in an east/west direction and
Saddleback Hill Road runs in a north/south direction at the intersection. Saddleback Hill Road is
stop controlled and Blackstone Street operates uncontrolled. The southbound approach to the
intersection, on Saddleback Hill Road, is 26-feet wide with no lane markings. Both Blackstone
Street approaches to the intersection have one 10-foot travel lane in each direction separated by a
single yellow centerline. Sidewalk is located on all approaches of the intersection and a
crosswalk is installed across Blackstone Street on the westerly side of Saddleback Hill Road. The
posted speed limit on Blackstone Street is 20 miles per hour and there is no posted speed limit on
Saddleback Hill Road.

North Street at the Proposed Site Entrance
The intersection of North Street and the Proposed Site Entrance is located on the westerly side of
North Street just south of Utility Pole Number 6. North Street runs in a north/south direction and
the site entrance runs in an east/west direction. North Street has one 10-foot travel lane in each
direction in the vicinity of the Site Entrance separated by a solid double yellow line. The posted
speed limit on North Street is 25 miles per hour.

Existing Traffic Volumes

The manual turning movement counts were completed in June 2012. For use as existing 2013
traffic volumes, the 2012 data was projected to 2013 using a 2% per year growth factor. Based
on the traffic counts completed, the peak hours along the roadway network in the vicinity of the
proposed Elmshade Subdivision occur from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and from 4:45 p.m. to 5:45
p.m. The volumes recorded during these hours were used in the capacity analysis of each
intersection.




                                               -5-
A 48-hour Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) count was completed on North Street in the
vicinity of the site entrance on October 29-30, 2013. According to this count data, the average
daily traffic (ADT) on North Street is approximately 3,800 vehicles per day.

Manual turning movement counts were not completed at the intersection of Blackstone Street and
Maddie Way as part of this study. Because Maddie Way is a cul-de-sac, motorists can only
access the roadway from Blackstone Street. The ITE Trip Generation Manual was used to
calculate estimated peak hour volumes entering and exiting Maddie Way based on the number of
existing single-family homes. The estimated volumes are shown in Figure 3 as existing volumes.

MassDOT traffic counting stations in the vicinity of the project area were reviewed to determine
the need for a seasonal adjustment of the existing volumes. According to the data available for
Station 6125 on Route I-495 in Bellingham at the Franklin Town Line, traffic volumes for the
month of June are approximately 7%-13% above the yearly average. To provide a conservative
analysis, no adjustments were made to the existing traffic volumes.

Existing a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 3.

Safety Analysis

Crash Data
MassDOT crash data for the most recent three years available, 2009 through 2011, was reviewed
for the roadway network surrounding the project site. The data was used in the calculation of
crash rates at the study area intersections utilizing the standard MassDOT procedures. The
MassDOT statewide average crash rates and the District 3 averages for unsignalized intersections
are provided below. The crash rates are provided in crashes per million entering vehicles.

Table 1: Crash Rate Averages for Signalized and Unsignalized Intersections
                                         Signalized              Unsignalized
                Statewide                   0.80                      0.60
                District 3                  0.89                      0.66

Based on the MassDOT crash data, seven crashes were reported at the intersection of North Street
with South Main Street, nine crashes were reported at the intersection of Blackstone Street with
South Main Street, and two crashes were reported at various locations along South Main Street
within the project area. No crashes were reported in the MassDOT data for the intersections of
North Street with Blackstone Street or Blackstone Street with Saddleback Way.

Three of the crashes reported at the intersection of North Street with South Main Street were rear-
end crashes, three were motorist collisions with an object, and one was an angle crash. Six of the
crashes involved property damage only and one resulted in an injury. The crash rate calculated for
this unsignalized intersection was 0.34, which is well below the MassDOT Statewide and District 3
averages. Overall, there is no apparent safety concern at this intersection.

Three of the ten crashes reported at the intersection of Blackstone Street with South Main Street
were rear-end crashes, two were angle crashes, two were motorist collisions with an object, one
was a sideswipe in the same direction, and one was a sideswipe in the opposite direction. Eight
of the reported crashes involved property damage only, while one involved an injury. The crash
rate calculated for this signalized intersection was 0.20, which is well below the MassDOT
Statewide and District 3 averages. Based on the available data, there does not appear to be an
existing safety concern at this intersection.

The two crashes reported on South Main Street within the project area occurred at addresses 960
and 975 South Main Street. One was an angle crash and one was a rear-end crash, both involving
injuries.

A summary of the crash data and the crash rate worksheets are provided in Appendix B.

Sight Distance
A spot speed study was performed on North Street in the vicinity of the proposed site entrance to
determine the average travel speed on the roadway. The speed data recorded indicates that the
85th percentile travel speed on the roadway is 39 miles per hour northbound and 41 miles per hour
southbound. The data collected is summarized below. Complete results are provided in
Appendix A.

Stopping Sight Distance
Based on the spot speed study performed, a design speed of 40 miles per hour was selected for
North Street, which is greater than the overall 85th percentile speed recorded on the roadway and the
posted 25 mile per hour speed limit. According to the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 6th
Edition, the minimum safe stopping sight distance for a 40 mile per hour condition is 305 feet, and
for a 25 mile per hour condition is 155 feet.

Stopping sight distance (SSD) for southbound traffic on North Street is approximately 460 feet.
Bushes planted in front of house number 41 on the east side of North Street are the limiting factor
for the clear line of sight. Northbound traffic on North Street has an available SSD of
approximately 565 feet. The crest curve on North Street south of the site entrance is the limiting
factor. Both SSD exceed the AASHTO requirements for the posted speed of 25 miles per hour on
a level roadway. The SSD for the southbound traffic is adequate for travel speeds up to 52 miles
per hour, while the SSD for northbound traffic is adequate for travel speeds up to 59 miles per
hour. Southbound traffic is coming down a hill approaching the site entrance, which requires a
slightly higher SSD than on a level roadway. The measured distance of 460 feet is adequate for
travel speeds up to 45 miles per hour for 6% or 9% grades and travel speeds up to 50 miles per
hour for 3% grades.

Table 3 below summarizes the requirements and the available stopping sight distances.

Intersection Sight Distance
Intersection sight distance (ISD) measurements were also taken from the proposed North Street
site entrance at a distance of 14.5 feet back from the edge of pavement. To the north, the
available ISD is approximately 70 feet due to shrubs adjacent to the north side of the driveway.
With some clearing of the area adjacent to the north side of the driveway, the ISD could be
increased to over 600 feet. To the south, the available ISD from the site entrance is
approximately 280 feet due to overhanging limbs from a tree adjacent to the south side of the
driveway. If the limbs were removed, the ISD could be increased to approximately 540 feet. The
ISD requirement for the posted 25 mile per hour speed limit is 280 feet for a left turn from stop



                                                   -9-
and 240 feet for a right turn from stop. The ISD requirement for the 40 mile per hour design
speed is 445 feet for a left turn from stop and 385 feet for a right turn from stop. Clearing is
required in both directions from the site entrance to meet the required ISD.

Table 4 below summarizes the requirements and the available intersection sight distances.

Build Conditions

The future 2018 build condition represents the future 2018 no-build condition plus the traffic
expected to be generated by the construction of the proposed development.

Trip Generation
Trip generation for the proposed 71-unit single-family residential development, Elmshade, was
completed using the industry standard Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation, 8th Edition. The proposed development was analyzed with Land Use Code 210,
Single-Family Detached Housing, based on the average number of vehicle trip ends versus
dwelling units for the weekday a.m. peak hour of adjacent street traffic, one hour between 7 and 9
a.m., and p.m. peak hour of adjacent street traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.

The proposed development is expected to generate 59 trips during the morning peak hour, 15
entering and 44 exiting. During the p.m. peak hour, the development is expected to generate 77
trips, 49 entering and 28 exiting. On a typical weekday, the development is expected to generate
759 trips per day. A summary of the new trips expected is provided below.

Complete trip generation calculations are provided in Appendix D.

Trip Distribution
Based on the current site layout, it was assumed that approximately 70% of the site traffic will
use the North Street driveway and approximately 30% will use the Blackstone Street driveway.

In accordance with the Bellingham Rules and Regulations for Development Traffic Impact and
Analysis Study, trip distribution was completed for the proposed development based on US
Census Commuting (Journey to Work) data. The available data indicates that the commuting
patterns of Bellingham residents follow the patterns below:
     Approximately 25% travel to/from the North ­ Middlesex County and parts of Worcester
        County
     Approximately 20% travel to/from the East ­ Norfolk county and Plymouth County
     Approximately 18% travel to/from the Northeast ­ Norfolk County, Suffolk County,
        Essex County, and Middlesex County
     Approximately 16% remain in Bellingham
     Approximately 10% travel to/from the South ­ Bristol County, MA, and Rhode Island
     Approximately 6% travel to/from the Northwest ­ Worcester County
     Approximately 3% travel to/from the Southeast ­ Nantucket County, Norfolk County,
        and Plymouth County
     Approximately 2% travel to/from the West ­ Worcester County, Hampden County

Reviewing the routes available to each of these general destinations, site-generated trips were
added into the existing roadway network according to the following assumptions:



                                              -15-
        50% of the new trips will travel to and from the site using South Main Street north of
        North Street
        30% of the new trips will travel to and from the site using Blackstone Street east of South
        Main Street
        15% of the new trips will travel to and from the site using South Main Street south of
        North Street
        5% will utilize North Street northwest of the site

Complete trip distribution calculations are provided in Appendix D, and the site-generated trips are
shown in Figure 6.

Capacity Analysis ­ Existing, Future No-Build, and Future Build Conditions

Capacity analysis was completed for all study intersections for existing, future 2018 no-build, and
future 2018 build conditions. Capacity analysis characterizes intersections based on their level of
service (LOS). LOS is a quality measure describing operational conditions within a traffic
stream, generally in terms of service measures such as speed, travel times, traffic interruptions,
etc. Six LOS are defined for each type of facility, from A to F, with A representing the best
operating conditions and F representing the worst operating conditions. The LOS criteria for both
signalized and unsignalized intersections are provided below.

Table 7: LOS Criteria for Signalized and Unsignalized Intersections
                        Signalized Intersection       Unsignalized Intersection
            LOS           Delay Time (sec/veh)           Delay Time (sec/veh)
              A                    10                            0-10
              B                > 10 ­ 20                        > 10-15
              C                > 20 ­ 35                        > 15-25
              D                 > 35 - 55                       > 25-35
              E                > 55 ­ 80                        > 35-50
              F                   > 80                           > 50


North Street and Blackstone Street
During the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, the approaches to the unsignalized intersection of North
Street and Blackstone Street currently operate at LOS B or better, with less than 13 seconds of
delay per vehicle. Under future 2018 no-build and build conditions, the approach LOS remain
unchanged, with less than two additional seconds of delay per vehicle. The v/c ratios on the
approaches also remain well below one.

The existing queue lengths on the approaches to the intersection are approximately eight feet or
less during both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Assuming an average vehicle length of 25 feet,
these queue lengths translate to no queue or one vehicle queued during the peak hours. Under
future 2018 no-build conditions, the queues increase by approximately two feet, and under 2018
build conditions, the queues increase by one to three feet. Overall, the approach queues are
expected to remain one vehicle or less under future 2018 build conditions.

Blackstone Street and Saddleback Hill Road
The unsignalized intersection of Blackstone Street with Saddleback Hill Road currently operates
with no conflicts and no queue lengths on any approach during both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
Under future 2018 no-build and future 2018 build conditions, no change in LOS or increase in
delay or queue is expected. The intersection will continue to operate with no conflicts.

North Street and South Main Street
The approaches to the unsignalized intersection of North Street with South Main Street operate at
varied LOS during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours. During both peak hours, the South Main Street
approaches to the intersection operate at LOS A with no conflict and less than 10 seconds of
delay per vehicle. The North Street approach to the intersection operates at LOS E with 43
seconds of delay during the a.m. peak hour and LOS F with over 100 seconds of delay during the
p.m. peak hour. Under the future 2018 no-build condition, the South Main Street approaches
remain unchanged, while the North Street approach operates at LOS F with increased delay




                                               -18-
during both peak hours. The LOS remains the same and delay times increase under the future
2018 build condition.

During the a.m. peak hour, queue lengths on the South Main Street approaches are currently
approximately one vehicle or less. Under future 2018 no-build and build conditions, negligible
increases in queue are expected. On the North Street approach, the existing a.m. peak queue is
approximately 92 feet, or about four vehicles. From the existing to future 2018 no-build, the
queue is expected to increase by approximately 275 feet, 11 vehicles. From the future 2018 no-
build to build condition, the additional increase is approximately 200 feet, 8 vehicles.

During the p.m. peak hour, queue lengths on the South Main Street approaches are currently
approximately one vehicle or less. Under future 2018 no-build and build conditions, negligible
increases in queue are expected. On the North Street approach, the existing p.m. peak queue is
approximately 260 feet, or about 11 vehicles. From the existing to future 2018 no build, the
queue is expected to increase by approximately 330 feet, 14 vehicles. From the future 2018 no-
build to build condition, the additional increase is approximately 140 feet, 6 vehicles.

The overall impact on the unsignalized intersection of North Street with South Main Street is
most significant from the existing condition to the future 2018 no-build condition. From the
future 2018 no-build to build condition, the expected traffic volume increase at the intersection is
42 vehicles during the a.m. peak hour and 54 vehicles during the p.m. peak hour, or
approximately a 2.5% increase. The Town Department of Public Works (DPW) has indicated
that a new traffic signal will be installed upstream at the intersection of South Main Street and
Center Street upon completion of the Lakeview Estates development, estimated to be 2-5 years
away. The addition of this signal will help create platoons on South Main Street, providing gaps
in traffic for vehicles turning onto and from North Street.

South Main Street and Blackstone Street
The signalized intersection of South Main Street with Blackstone Street operates at LOS D with
approximately 40 seconds of delay during both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours. The LOS on the
approaches vary, with delays from 5 seconds to 89 seconds. Under the future 2018 no-build
condition, the overall intersection LOS decreases to LOS F with delays over 100 seconds. The
expected delay increase is approximately 76 seconds during the a.m. peak hour and
approximately 106 seconds during the p.m. peak hour. Under the future 2018 build condition, the
overall intersection LOS remains at LOS F with delay increases of approximately 31 seconds
during the a.m. peak hour and approximately 9 seconds during the p.m. peak hour. The build
condition is expected to add approximately 45 vehicles to the intersection during the a.m. peak
hour and approximately 62 vehicles during the p.m. peak hour for an overall increase of
approximately 2.5%. The impacts on LOS and delay at this intersection are most significant from
the existing to future 2018 no-build condition.

The queue lengths on each approach to the intersection vary considerably during the a.m. and
p.m. peak hours. During the a.m. peak hour, the most significant queues currently exist in the
northbound left/through lane, the southbound through/right lane, and the westbound left turn lane.
Between existing and future 2018 no-build conditions, queue increases within these lanes are
expected to be approximately 335 feet, 465 feet, and 155 feet, respectively. On the same
approaches, the expected increases with the addition of the site traffic are 25 feet, 35 feet, and 15
feet, respectively. During the p.m. peak hour, the most significant queue currently occurs on the
northbound approach in both the left/through and right turn lanes. From existing to future no-
build 2018 conditions, the queue increases for these two lanes are expected to be 340 feet and 300
feet, respectively. From the no-build to the build condition, the expected increases are 20 and 15


                                                -19-
feet, respectively. Similar to the LOS and delay times, the overall impact of the future 2018 no-
build traffic is much more significant than the addition of the site-generated traffic.

Blackstone Street and Maddie Way
With the construction of the Elmshade residential development, the intersection of Blackstone
Street with Maddie Way will be reconfigured into a traditional "T" intersection. It is anticipated
that Maddie Way will operate under stop sign control and Blackstone Street will remain
uncontrolled. For the purposes of the future 2018 build analysis, this intersection was analyzed as
a two-way stop controlled intersection. Capacity analysis was not completed for the existing and
no-build conditions, as there are no conflicting movements at the intersection that would generate
delays.

During both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, the Maddie Way approach to the unsignalized
intersection of Blackstone Street with Maddie Way is expected to operate at LOS A with delays
less than nine seconds per vehicle. The Blackstone Street approaches are expected to operate
with no conflicts or delays. The peak hour queue lengths expected on the Maddie Way approach
are negligible, typically less than the assumed 25' length of one vehicle.

North Street and Proposed Site Entrance
The approaches to the intersection of the proposed Elmshade entrance and North Street are
expected to operate at LOS A with minimal or no delays during both the a.m. and p.m. peak
hours. The queues on these approaches are expected to be one vehicle or less.

Future build traffic volumes for all study area intersections for both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours
are shown in Figure 7 and the a.m. and p.m. peak hour level of service tables are presented
in Tables 8 and 9. Complete capacity analysis results are presented in Appendix E.

Potential Mitigation Measures

North Street and South Main Street
The town DPW indicated that plans had previously been prepared for the installation of a left turn
lane on South Main Street northbound at the North Street intersection. Capacity analysis was
completed for this configuration, and it would not have a significant improvement on intersection
LOS or delay. However, it does somewhat improve the volume to capacity (v/c) ratios and the
queue lengths. The stacking lane for the northbound left turns removes them from the traffic
stream and allows northbound through traffic to continue unimpeded. It also clearly indicates to
motorists turning from North Street who is turning left, providing added time for them to make a
decision to turn.

A second potential mitigation measure that could be considered for this intersection is the
installation of a traffic signal. A full warrant analysis was not completed; however, a review of
the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) Peak Hour traffic signal warrant
indicates that the future no-build 2018 projections meet the warrant thresholds during both the
a.m. and p.m. peak hours. The existing 2013 volumes are just shy of the threshold for the a.m.
peak hour, and meet the warrant for the p.m. peak hour. Because the 2018 volumes are
conservative projections including a 2% per year growth factor and a number of potential
developments, it is not recommended that signal installation occur based on these volumes.
Instead, it is recommended that the Town revisit the issue upon completion of several of the
specific developments included in the background traffic. The peak hour warrant analysis is
provided in Appendix F.

South Main Street and Blackstone Street
Optimization of the existing traffic signal at the intersection of South Main Street with Blackstone
Street was considered as a potential mitigation measure. The overall benefits for LOS, delay, and
queue length are varied. In general, where the LOS or delays are improved on an approach, the
queue length is negatively impacted. This is reasonable, because the longer one approach
remains green, the more time the opposing approaches have to develop a queue. In general,
signal optimization shows positive impacts on the overall intersection LOS and delay. Because
the 2% background growth and volume of traffic added from specific developments are so
conservative, it may benefit the Town to complete peak hour traffic counts following construction
and occupancy of several of the area-specific projects to determine the actual need for timing
changes. Otherwise, the signal may be retimed with peak hour timing plans that are too long for
the volume of traffic actually traversing the intersection.

Tables 10 and 11 show the capacity analysis results for the mitigation measures compared to the
future 2018 build conditions.

Conclusions


The crash data received from MassDOT shows a small number of crashes reported within the study
area between 2009 and 2011. The crash rate calculated for each of the intersections was lower than
both the MassDOT and District 3 averages for the respective intersection type. It is not anticipated
that the construction of the Elmshade residential development will have a significant safety impact
on any of the study area intersections.

From the proposed site entrance, the available stopping sight distance to the north and to the south
exceeds the AASHTO requirements for the selected 40 mile per hour design speed and the posted
25 mile per hour speed limit. To meet the required intersection sight distance for the design speed,
clearing will be required on the lot adjacent to the north side of the proposed entrance. It is
recommended to clear the adjacent vegetation to the extent required for the posted 25 mile per hour
speed limit rather than the 40 mile per hour design speed. This will provide adequate lines of sight
to the north and south for the posted condition, and will help maintain the beauty and character of
the roadway and overall area.

The impacts of the construction of the Elmshade development on the overall roadway network
surrounding the site are varied. A background growth percentage of 2% per year was included, as
were trips from a number of area-specific developments. The resulting future 2018 volumes
provide a very conservative analysis of the future conditions. In general, the impacts are greater
between the existing and future 2018 no-build conditions than between the no-build and build
conditions. Under the future 2018 build conditions, several intersections are expected to
experience no impact, while others will have changes in LOS or increases in delay or queue
length. At the intersection of Blackstone Street with Maddie Way, geometric improvements will
be required to create a traditional "T" intersection. With the improvements, the intersection is
expected to operate at acceptable LOS with minimal delays. The intersection of Blackstone
Street with South Main Street will experience impacts during both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours,
however, it is possible that the LOS and delay impacts could be reduced with modifications to the
existing signal timing. The intersection of North Street with South Main Street is also expected
to be impacted by the development. As mentioned earlier in the study, the existing volumes at
this intersection are close to or meet one traffic signal warrant during the a.m. and p.m. peak hour.
The Town may wish to pursue a full traffic signal warrant analysis for this intersection
independent of any developments within the Town. The installation of a traffic signal upstream
on South Main Street at the Center Street intersection will help create gaps in the South Main
Street traffic for turning vehicles to and from North Street.

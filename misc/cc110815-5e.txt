Subject:                Four-way stop at the intersection of Cutting Boulevard and Arlington
                        Boulevard

ACTIONREQUESTED
Adopt a resolution authorizing the City EngineerIPublic Works Director to establish a
four-way stop at the intersection of Cutting Boulevard and Arlington Boulevard.

DISCUSSION
The Public Works Department has received many complaints concerning the limited
visibility and confusing traffic control at the intersection of Cutting Boulevard and
Arlington Boulevard. The intersection of Cutting Boulevard and Arlington Boulevard is
located in a residential neighborhood. Both streets are classified as minor arterials and
have an 85th-percentile speed of 30 miles per hour (mph) and above in this area.
Arlington Boulevard is also designated as a pedestrian and bicycle route.

The intersection has four legs of which all except the eastbound Cutting Boulevard
approach are controlled by stop signs. Vehicles on northbound and southbound
Arlington Boulevard and westbound
Cutting Boulevard must stop for
vehicles     on      eastbound     Cutting
Boulevard. The three-way stop control
at a four-leg intersection is unusual.

Arlington Boulevard has a gradual slope
at the intersection. However, there is a
steeper uphill slope on eastbound
Cutting Boulevard.           Additionally,
eastbound Cutting Boulevard and
northbound        Arlington     Boulevard
intersect at a sharp angle as shown.

        ANALYSIS
        Multiway (also known as all-way) stop control can be useful as a safety measure at
        intersections if certain traffic conditions exist. As such, the intersection must meet one
        or more specific traffic criteria established by the State of California, Department of
        Transportation in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for the
        installation of multiway stop control. Public Works staff requested that our on-call
        traffic engineering consultant, TJKM Transportation Consultants, conduct an
        engineering study to evaluate this criteria for the intersection of Cutting Boulevard and
        Arlington Boulevard.

        The State criteria indicates that multiway stop control can be installed where the number
        of cars approaching the intersection from all directions is approximately equal for any
        eight hours of an average day or where there is a collision problem as indicated by five
        or more reported crashes susceptible to correction by a multiway stop. Such crashes
        include right- and left-turn collisions as well as right-angle collisions. Other criteria that
        may be considered in an engineering study include the need to control left-turn conflicts;
        the need to control vehiclelpedestrian conflicts near locations that generate high
        pedestrian volume; locations where a road user, after stopping, cannot see conflicting
        traffic and is not able to safely negotiate the intersection unless conflicting cross traffic
        is also required to stop; and an intersection of two residential collector (through) streets
        of similar design and operating characteristics where multiway stop control would
        improve traffic operational characteristics of the intersection.
        TJKM determined that although the traffic volume and collision criteria were not met,
        the criteria based on visibility constraints and traffic operational improvements were
        met. Visibility of vehicles traveling on eastbound Cutting Boulevard is problematic for
        vehicular or pedestrian traffic on northbound Arlington Boulevard because of the steep
        grade and skewed angle of the intersection. This awkward geometry along with unusual
        three-way stop control at the intersection leads to motorist confusion.
        Arlington Boulevard is considered to be the major street at this intersection because it
        carries higher traffic volumes than Cutting Boulevard. However, both intersections
'
    ,   function similarly like residential collectors. Therefore, stopping both approaches of
        Cutting Boulevard along with those on Arlington Boulevard will improve traffic
        operational conditions at this intersection. With the installation of a four-way stop, the
        intersection will operate at better levels of service and vehicle queuing will be reduced.
        Given these conditions, TJKM has determined that the intersection of Cutting Boulevard
        and Arlington Boulevard meets the State criteria for multiway stop sign control. The
        TJKM study report is attached. The installation of a four-way stop is expected to
        improve traffic safety and operations at this intersection. Based on these factors, Public
        Works staff recommends the installation of a stop sign and associated pavement
        markings on the eastbound approach of Cutting Boulevard to establish a four-way stop
        at the intersection.

FINANCIAL
        CONSIDERATIONS
The cost for installation of a stop sign and associated pavement markings is estimated to
be approximately $1,000 and is included in the Public Works, Maintenance operating
budget.

LEGAL
    CONSIDERATIONS
As required by Chapter 11.36 of the El Cerrito Municipal Code, installation of any stop
sign must be approved by City Council Resolution.

         2. The need to control vehiclelpedestrian conflicts near locations that generate high pedestrian

         4, An intersection of two residential neighborhood collector (through) street of similar design and
             operating characteristics where multiway stop control would improve traffic operational
             characteristics of the intersection.

TJKM conducted All-Way Stop analysis for the intersection based on the MUTCD criteria. This
included collision analysis based on a review of the most current 5-year SWITRS collision database
(2005 t o 2009). The details are contained in Appendix B.

Existing Condition
Cutting Boulevard and Arlington Boulevard are both t w o lane minor arterial. Stop control is
currently located on three of the approaches - the only uncontrolled approach is the west leg of
Cutting Boulevard. Although these streets are both arterial streets, they function like residential
collectors.

The ADT on Cutting Boulevard and Arlington Boulevard are respectively 2,900 vpd and 3,800 vpd.
Pedestrian andbicycle traffic is quite low with less than ten on all approaches during the peak
hours.

Arlington Boulevard has a gradual slope on the
north-south approach at the intersection.
However, there is a steep slope of
approximately ten percent on the west leg of
Cutting Boulevard as it approaches the
intersection. This is also the approach not stop
sign controlled. Due t o the steep slope and
skewed angle on Cutting Boulevard (the west
leg approach), visibility has been an issue.

Results of Analysis
The following is a summary of the minimum
criteria as indicated in the MUTCD:
Minimum volumes (8-hour) - not met for both
major and minor streets. Volume criteria met
for six of eight hours on the major street and
met five hours on the minor street.
Collision Criteria Pve or more r e ~ o r t e d
                                             crashes in a 12-month period that are susceptible to correction)   -
A total of t w o accidents were reported in a 12-month period.

Note the MUTCD warrants also include the other criteria that may be considered in an
engineering study include in Criteria D-3 that states:
" Locations where a road user, after stopping, cannot see conflicting traffic and is not able to safely
negotiate the intersection unless conflicting cross traffic is also required to stop;. .."
I t is our understanding that many residents have complained that since the west leg was
uncontrolled and due t o the grade and skewed angle, traffic from the other three approaches have
frequently encountered safety issues due t o visibility problems at the intersection. Another issue
is that a three-way stop control at a four-way intersection is unusual. According t o staff,
complaints of various near-misses have been reported. Due t o sight visibility constraints and
associated issues, an all-way stop control intersection is justified based on MUTCD Other D-
3Criteria. The detailed information and summary of the all-way stop analysis are contained in
Appendix B.

Level of Service LOS Analysis
The existing peak hour data were analyzed using the Synchro software and the level of service
(LOS) along with queuing analysis were performed for the existing conditions and the proposed
All-Way Stop control, The queuing analysis performed is based on the results of Simtraffic micro-
simulation at 95th percentile queuing. The results of the analysis are shown in Table I.

Note: queuing is based on the worst approach queue.

The intersection will operate at LOS F during the a.m. peak hour as shown in Table I. If converted
to All-Way Stop control, the intersection will operate at LOS C and LOS B, respectively during
the a.m. and p.m. peak hour. With All-Way Stop control, the estimated maximum queue would be
reduced from the estimated existing queue of 163 feet to approximately 108 feet during the a.m.
peak hour (approximately 33 percent decrease). Therefore, based on the MUTCD Other D-
4Criteria, a conversion t o multiway stop control would improve traffic operational characteristics
of the intersection.


Conclusion: All Way Stop justified based on MUTCD Other D-3and D-4 Criteria.

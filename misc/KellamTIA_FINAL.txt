1.0 Executive Summary
The existing Kellam High School, built in 1962, sits on an approximately 31 acre site on Holland Road near the
Virginia Beach City Municipal Center. Access to the school is restricted to three driveways along Holland Road,
a two-lane urban minor arterial with a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour. The age of the school, student
population, site characteristics, and anticipated development around the school have prompted the City to
relocate the school to a new site approximately 1.5 miles from the existing school location. The new site, nearly
four times the size of the existing site at 108 acres, will be located on West Neck Road, a two-lane urban
collector with a posted speed limit of 40 miles per hour. Construction is expected to begin in 2011, with
occupancy expected by 2014. An estimated 2000 students/150 faculty will attend the proposed school, an
increase of approximately 150 students from current enrollment. Figure 1 shows the location of the existing and
proposed Kellam High School.

Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. (KHA) was retained by the City to perform a traffic impact study for the
proposed development. The study area includes roadways and intersections in the vicinity of the proposed site.
The proposed site will distribute current traffic patterns, thus increasing traffic volumes along West Neck Road
and North Landing Road. More significantly than the proposed development, the projected background traffic
growth will increase the volumes of traffic along these roadways with the exception of North Landing Road.
Due to the extension of Nimmo Parkway to the east, a portion of traffic that is currently utilizing North Landing
Road will shift to Nimmo Parkway. To maintain traffic operations along the study area roadways under the
future 2015 scenario, the following improvements are recommended:

Princess Anne Road/ Holland Road
          Maintain existing laneage


Princess Anne Road/ North Landing Road
          Maintain existing laneage


North Landing Road/West Neck Road
          Maintain existing laneage
          Modify existing traffic signal timing to accommodate additional school traffic and provide
          coordination with the existing signal system.


Princess Anne Road/James Madison Boulevard
          Maintain existing laneage


Proposed North Driveway/West Neck Road/Driveway to the East
          Locate the North Driveway to align to a driveway to the east to allow for the creation of a 4-way
          intersection.

          Construct an exclusive northbound and southbound left-turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a 200
          foot taper.
          Construct an exclusive southbound right-turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a 100 foot taper.
          Construct the North Driveway to provide one ingress lane and two egress lanes to accommodate a
          separate right and left-turn lane.
          Operate intersection as STOP controlled for the side streets.
          Driveway should be a minimum of 36 feet wide with a minimum radii of 25 feet.


Proposed South Driveway/West Neck Road/Driveway to the East
          Locate the South Driveway to align to a driveway to the east to allow for the creation of a 4-Way
          intersection. (Note: the southbound left-turn will provide future access to a fourth leg and U-
          Turns).
          Construct a northbound left-turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a 100 foot taper and a
          southbound left-turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a 200 foot taper.
          Construct a southbound right-turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a 100 foot taper.
          Construct the entrance of the South Driveway to provide one ingress lane and two egress lanes to
          accommodate a separate right and left-turn lane.
          Operate intersection as STOP controlled for the side streets.
          Driveway should be a minimum of 36 feet wide with a minimum radii of 25 feet.


West Neck Road

          School Zone Flashing Beacons shall be installed along both directions of West Neck Road to warn
          vehicles of reduced speed limit.
          Construct an additional northbound and southbound through lane along the frontage of the site. A
          preliminary/conceptual layout of the improvements along both directions of West Neck Road is
          provided in the Appendix.

2.0 Introduction
The existing Kellam High School, built in 1962, sits on an approximately 31 acre site on Holland Road near the
Virginia Beach City Municipal Center. Access to the school is restricted to three driveways along Holland Road,
a two-lane urban minor arterial with a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour. The age of the school, student
population, site characteristics, and anticipated development around the school have prompted the City to
relocate the school to a new site approximately 1.5 miles from the existing school location. The new site, nearly
four times the size of the existing site at 108 acres, will be located on West Neck Road, a two-lane urban
collector with a posted speed limit of 40 miles per hour. Construction is expected to begin in 2011, with
occupancy expected by 2014. An estimated 2000 students/150 faculty will attend the proposed school, an
increase of approximately 150 students from current enrollment. Figure 1 shows the location of the existing and
proposed Kellam High School.

As shown in Figure 1, Holland Road and West Neck Road are generally oriented in a north/south direction. The
study has been prepared for submittal to the City of Virginia Beach to evaluate existing traffic conditions at the
current high school as well as future traffic conditions at the relocated high school. Kimley-Horn discussed the
necessary assumptions (trip distribution and traffic assignment) and potential future roadway improvements with
the City that should be considered as part of this traffic impact study (TIS). As previously stated, the proposed
high school is anticipated to be occupied by 2014.

This TIS provides trip distribution, traffic analyses, and recommendations for transportation improvements, such
as roadway geometrics, turn-lane requirements, and signal timing adjustments, to mitigate potential traffic impact
generated by the relocated high school. Although the school will be occupied by 2014, traffic analyses are
provided for the year 2015 to account for the Nimmo Parkway Extension roadway improvement which will have
an impact on local traffic patterns within the study area. While background traffic volumes will be incrementally
grown from 2010 to 2015, the student population (which is the capacity of the school) will remain at 2000 for the
build-year analyses. This study analyzes the following scenarios for the weekday AM and PM peak hours that
coincide with start and end of the school day:

     Roadways

          Holland Road

          Princess Anne Road (State Route 149/165)

          North Landing Road (State Route 165)

          West Neck Road

     Intersections

          North Landing Road/West Neck Road (signalized)

          North Landing Road/Princess Anne Road (signalized)

          Princess Anne Road/Holland Road (signalized)

          Princess Anne Road/James Madison Boulevard (unsignalized)

          Holland Road/Kellam High School Driveway #3 (unsignalized)

          Holland Road/Kellam High School Driveway #2 (unsignalized)

          Holland Road/Kellam High School Driveway #1 (unsignalized)

Study area roadways and intersections were identified through conversations with the City of Virginia and
also include all site driveways.

3.2 Existing Land Use

The proposed development is located south of North Landing Road on West Neck Road. The overall area is
primarily rural with several neighborhoods to the west and south of the site. The 108 acre site is currently zoned
R10 (residential) and will be rezoned to agriculture.

3.3 Existing Conditions

The following paragraphs provide a short description of existing roadway characteristics within the project
vicinity.

Holland Road is a two-lane urban minor arterial that provides exclusive access to the existing Kellam High
School. Holland Road intersects with Princess Anne Road within the study area. The posted speed limit
along Holland Road in the study area is 35 miles per hour (mph).



                                                     Page 5 of 31
Kellam High School Relocation Traffic Impact Study                                          March 15, 2010




Princess Anne Road (State Route 149 and 165) is a two-lane urban minor arterial. Princess Anne Road
intersects with Holland Road and North Landing Road within the study area. The posted speed limit along
Princess Anne Road is 25 mph west of Holland Road and 35 mph east of Holland Road.

North Landing Road (State Route 165) is a two-lane urban minor arterial. North Landing Road intersects
with Princess Anne Road within the study area. The posted speed limit along North Landing Road is 25
mph between Princess Anne Road and just west of George Mason Drive, at which point the speed limit
increases to 35 mph.

West Neck Road is a two-lane urban collector. West Neck Road intersects with North Landing Road
within the study area. The posted speed limit along West Neck Road is 40 mph.

Figure 2 depicts existing laneage for the study area roadways and intersections.

3.3.1 Existing Site Circulation and Parking Characteristics

Site circulation within the current Kellam High School facility provides a separate drop-off loop for
students being dropped off by personal transportation and buses. All vehicles enter the site through
Driveway 1 and 2. Buses park in the bus loop in front of the school, holding students until 7:10 AM when
they are released into the school. Any buses unable to park in the bus loop overflow to the north side of the
building adjacent to the senior parking lot. Buses exit the site through Driveway 3. Students dropped off
by personal transportation (i.e. parent or guardian) are directed to the north side of the building and loop
around the senior parking lot to deliver the student. These vehicles then exit the site through the
faculty/visitor parking lot and onto Holland Road via the Driveway 3.

Students arriving by self-transportation enter the site through Driveway 1 and 2 and park according to their
decal. Seniors are permitted to park in the paved lot adjacent to the building. Juniors are permitted to park
in the gravel lot adjacent to the senior parking lot. While access is provided to Driveway 1 from Holland
Road, left turn movements into and out of the lot are restricted due to the limited spacing provided between
Driveway 1 and 2. Secondary access to the junior lot is provided at the west end of the senior parking lot.
Students exit at the end of the day onto Holland Road via Driveway 2. In addition to the allowable school
parking, some students choose to park at the 911 Call Center located at the intersection of Holland Road
and James Madison Road.

Figure 1 depicts designations for the various parking lots and loops.

3.4 Existing Traffic

Existing AM and PM peak hour weekday turning movement counts (TMCs) were obtained by Kimley-Horn
and Associates, Inc. (KHA). Traffic counts for the school driveways were collected from 6:30 AM to 7:30
AM and from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, which were based on Kellam High School schedule. Traffic counts for
the major intersections were collected from 6:30 AM to 8:30 AM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM.

To clarify what the AM and PM peak hours represent the following applies:

          The AM peak hour analyzed as part of this study includes the overlap of the peaking traffic
          conditions of the current Kellam High School and the adjacent street network. In other words the
          school traffic and commuter traffic coincide in the morning.

          The PM peak hour analyzed as part of this study includes the peaking traffic conditions of the
          current Kellam High School and the adjacent street network between the hours of 2:00 PM and 4:00
          PM. The true PM peak condition of the study area street network occurs between 5:00-6:00 PM,
          however at that time school is out of session and it does not reflect any school traffic. Therefore,
          for the purposes of this study that analyzes the school and its traffic impacts, the PM peak
          conditions of the school was used as the period of analysis.

The study area intersections are listed below:

          Holland Road/Driveway 1­January 12th, 2010

          North Landing Road/West Neck Road­January 12th, 2010

January 12th and 13th of 2010, 24-hour, bi-directional average daily traffic (ADT) counts were obtained by
KHA at the following locations:

          West Neck Road (south of the proposed school site)
          North Landing Road (east of the intersection of North Landing Road/West Neck Road)

Figure 3 shows the existing turning movement count (TMC) volumes during the AM and PM peak hours
along with the 24-hour ADT traffic volumes. Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate the traffic composition of the
total traffic volumes to show specifically what traffic is background traffic versus the traffic associated to

4.0 Traffic Generation
The traffic volumes collected at the school driveways were used to calculate the trip generation rates for the
school on a per student basis. The normal high school arrival and dismissal times are 7:25 am and 2:00 pm,
respectively. While most students follow the normal school hours, some senior students choose alternative
schedules. The traffic counts reflect normal school hours, with the morning peak of traffic occurring at 7:30 am
to 8:30 am and the afternoon peak hour occurring from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm. The traffic counts collected at the
school driveways along with the 911 Call Center indicate that Kellam High School generates 913 trips in the AM
peak hour and 505 trips in the PM peak hour, as shown in Table 1. According to data supplied by the school
staff the total enrollment for the high school is 1,873 students and the attendance the day the traffic counts were
collected was 1,790 students with 260 senior students leaving early due to the alternative schedule program.
Thus, the school is assumed to generate 0.51 trips per student in the AM peak hour and 0.33 trips per student in
the PM peak hour. Thus, for the purpose of this report, all analyses will use the actual trip generation rates for the
school, as observed on January 12th, 2009.

Utilizing trip generation rates determined above, trip generation rates were determined for the 2015 build year, at
which point attendance will reach a capacity at 2000 students. For the A.M. peak hour, the site generates 1020
trips, and during the P.M. peak hour, the site generates 660 trips. Table 2 summaries the total trips and
corresponding in and out volumes based on the existing distribution.

The future daily traffic generation potential for the proposed High School was determined using the traffic
generation rate published in for a high school (ITE Code 530). Based on the trip generation rate for 2000
students/150 faculty, the daily trips generated by the site is 3,420 trips. As a note, the proposed AM and PM
peak hour trip generation that is calculated in Table 2 is greater than the total peak hour trips shown in the ITE
Trip Generation Manual.

Kellam High School Relocation Traffic Impact Study                                                 March 15, 2010




5.0 Traffic Distribution
The directional distribution and assignment of trips generated by the proposed development is based on
discussions with the City, a review of existing roadway volumes at the current high school site, an understanding
of the distribution of students in the attendance zone for Kellam High School, and average bus ridership provided
by the school. With all these sources, the confidence level of the distribution is high. Generally, directional
distribution between existing and future conditions is approximately the same along the four roadways within the
study area. The following regional distribution was determined based on traffic counts and was applied to the
2015 future scenario:

          21% to/from the north on Holland Road

          3% to/from the north on Princess Anne Road

          40% to/from the east on Princess Anne Road

          16% to/from the west on North Landing Road

          20% to/from the south on West Neck Road

Site traffic distribution for the proposed development is illustrated in Figure 6.




6.0 Site Access and Traffic Assignment
West Neck Road will be the only roadway providing access to the site. Access to the school will consist of
driveways along West Neck Road; one driveway at the north end of the site and one driveway near the south end
of the site. While the ultimate site circulation for the proposed site has yet to be approved, current plans for the
site will allow full access at both driveways, with students and visitors/parent drop-off traffic utilizing the north
driveway and buses, service vehicles, and faculty utilizing the south driveway.

7.0 Projected Traffic Volumes
The relocated Kellam High School is being designed for a maximum capacity of 2,000 students. Therefore
for analysis purposes a full capacity school was assumed in the calculations. The current student population
of 1,873 students indicates an estimated 1.7% growth rate in the student population. The future site traffic
volumes were assigned based on the calculated trip distribution. VDOT historical data, City of Virginia
Beach traffic count database, along with the counts collected by Kimley-Horn indicates an annual growth
rate of 2.5% was calculated for the intersection of North Landing Road and West Neck Road and an annual
growth rate of 1.5% for the remaining study area intersections. Due to the construction of the Nimmo
Parkway extension, traffic currently utilizing North Landing Road and Princess Anne Road is projected to
shift to the Nimmo Parkway Extension. Projected 2015 traffic volumes were calculated based on the
following information:

          Existing Kellam High School site traffic was subtracted off of total traffic volumes to calculate
          background traffic volumes.

          A growth of 1.5% - 2.5% was applied to the background traffic volumes to calculate 2015
          background traffic volumes.

          The projected site traffic volumes for the proposed Kellam High School (based off of 2,000
          maximum student capacity) was added to the 2015 background traffic volumes to calculate 2015
          total traffic volumes.

     Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the 2015 AM and 2015 PM future traffic volumes, respectively.

8.0 Traffic Operations Analysis
Capacity analyses for the signalized and unsignalized intersections in the AM and PM peak hours (provided in
the Appendix) were performed for the following scenarios:

          Existing Conditions

          2015 Build Conditions

As explained in Section 3.4, the AM and PM peak hours represent the following:

          The AM peak hour analyzed as part of this study includes the overlap of the peaking traffic
          conditions of the current Kellam High School and the adjacent street network. In other words the
          school traffic and commuter traffic coincide in the morning.

          The PM peak hour analyzed as part of this study includes the peaking traffic conditions of the
          current Kellam High School and the adjacent street network between the hours of 2:00 PM and 4:00
          PM. The true PM peak condition of the study area street network occurs between 5:00-6:00 PM,
          however at that time school is out of session and it does not reflect any school traffic. Therefore,
          for the purposes of this study that analyzes the school and its traffic impacts, the PM peak
          conditions of the school was used as the period of analysis.

Analyses were completed to determine the operating characteristics of study area intersections and roadways
using Synchro Professional 7.0, which uses methodologies provided in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM) [TRB Special Report 209, 2000].

Intersection turning movement counts, number of lanes, and existing traffic control at each intersection was used
to determine existing and future levels of service. Future 2015 roadway laneage is shown in Figure 9. Level of
service (LOS) describes traffic conditions by the amount of traffic congestion at an intersection or along a
roadway. LOS ranges from A to F, where LOS A indicates a condition of little or no congestion, and LOS F
indicates severe congestion, unstable traffic flow, and stop-and-go conditions. For intersections, LOS is based
on the average delay experienced by all traffic using the intersection during the busiest (peak) 15-minute period.
LOS A through LOS D are generally considered acceptable.

Each of the aforementioned scenarios was analyzed during the weekday AM and PM peak hours. Under the
existing scenarios, existing cycle lengths, splits, and offsets were used in each time period analyzed to reflect
actual traffic operations, with the existing signals currently being coordinated and actuated. Under the Build for
the future year scenario, cycle lengths, splits, and offsets were optimized to reflect optimized traffic operations.
The results are presented in the following summaries, and supporting calculations are presented in the
Appendix.

8.1 Princess Anne Road/Holland Road

This signalized intersection currently provides the following laneage:

          Princess Anne Road (eastbound)--one exclusive left-turn lane and one exclusive through lane

          Princess Anne Road (westbound) --one exclusive right-turn lane and one exclusive through lane

          Holland Road (southbound)--one exclusive left-turn lane and one exclusive right-turn lane

Under existing conditions, this intersection functions at an overall LOS D during the AM peak hour and overall
LOS C during the PM peak hour. 2015 Build conditions provide improved operations during both peaks due to
the construction of the Nimmo Parkway Extension, and the intersection operates at an overall LOS B during both
peak hours.

Table 3 indicates levels of service and delays for the intersection under existing and Build (2015) conditions
for the AM peak hour and the PM peak hour, respectively. Detailed level of service calculations are provided
in the Appendix.

8.2 Princess Anne Road/North Landing Road

This signalized intersection currently provides the following laneage:

          North Landing Road (eastbound)--one exclusive left-turn lane and one exclusive through turn lane

          Princess Anne Road (westbound) -- one shared through and right turn lane, with a small taper for
          right turning vehicles (this was analyzed as a storage lane for worse case scenario)

          Princess Anne Road (southbound)--one exclusive left-turn lane and one exclusive right-turn lane

Under existing conditions, this intersection functions acceptably at an overall LOS C during the AM peak hour
and the PM peak hour. Under 2015 Build conditions, the intersection operates at an overall LOS B in both the
AM peak hour and PM peak hour. The improved level of service is due to the construction of the Nimmo

Under existing conditions, this intersection functions acceptably at an overall LOS C during the AM peak hour
and the PM peak hour. Under 2015 Build conditions, the intersection operates at an overall LOS D in the AM
peak hour and LOS C in the PM peak hour during the school year. Since a high concentration of vehicles will
have to pass through the intersection of North Landing Road/West Neck Road in a short amount of time (30
minutes or less), some congestion will be expected. The westbound left-turn lane may need to be restriped to
allow for the storage to be extended utilizing the existing gore area. The additional storage would be created by a
width less than 12 feet.

for the AM peak hour and the PM peak hour, respectively. Detailed level of service calculations are provided

8.8 Site Access and Traffic Circulation

The site will be accessed by two full access driveways along West Neck Road with separate right and left
turn egress movements from the site; therefore it is recommended that each site driveway be 36 feet wide to
provide one ingress lane and two egress lanes. Although during school peak hours, the on-site queues for
exiting traffic are expected to exceed the available storage lengths at each of the site driveways, no
modifications are recommended because the congestion is expected to only occur during the arrival and
dismissal times of the school and all congestion is expected to occur on-site, without impact to the adjacent
street.

Each of the following site driveways were analyzed during the weekday AM and PM peak hours.


West Neck Road/North Driveway/Driveway to the East

This unsignalized intersection will provide the following laneage:

          North Driveway (eastbound)--one exclusive left-turn lane and one exclusive right-turn lane

          West Neck Road (northbound)-- one exclusive left-turn lane, one exclusive through lane, and one
          shared through-right turn lane

          West Neck Road (southbound)-- two exclusive through lanes and one exclusive right-turn lane

Under 2015 Build conditions, this intersection functions at an overall LOS D during the AM peak hour and an
overall LOS A during the PM peak hours and PM peak hour. The reason for the LOS D during the AM peak
hour is due to the high concentration of vehicles accessing the site in a short amount of time (30 minutes or less).
This creates delays for certain movements, which contributes to the poor level of service. Furthermore, stop-
controlled side street intersections will typically experience higher delay than signalized intersections.

Table 10 indicates levels of service and delays for the intersection under 2015 Build conditions for the AM
   peak hour and the PM peak hour. Detailed level of service calculations are provided in the Appendix.

          West Neck Road (southbound)-- one exclusive left-turn lane (U-Turns), two exclusive through
          lanes, and one exclusive right-turn lane

Under 2015 Build conditions, this intersection functions at an overall LOS A during the AM peak hour and an
overall LOS E during the PM peak hour. The reason for the LOS E during the PM peak hour is due to the high
concentration of vehicles leaving the site in a short amount of time (30 minutes or less). This creates delays for
certain movements, which contributes to the poor level of service. Furthermore, stop-controlled side street
intersections will typically experience higher delay than signalized intersections.

Table 11 indicates levels of service and delays for the intersection under 2015 Build conditions for the AM
peak hour and the PM peak hour. Detailed level of service calculations are provided in the Appendix.

9.0 Conclusions and Recommendations
The existing Kellam High School, built in 1962, sits on an approximately 31 acre site on Holland Road near the
Virginia Beach City Municipal Center. Access to the school is restricted to three driveways along Holland Road,
a two-lane urban minor arterial with a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour. The age of the school, student
population, site characteristics, and anticipated development around the school have prompted the City to
relocate the school to a new site approximately 1.5 miles from the existing school location. The new site, nearly
four times the size of the existing site at 108 acres, will be located on West Neck Road, a two-lane urban
collector with a posted speed limit of 40 miles per hour. Construction is expected to begin in 2011, with
occupancy expected by 2014. An estimated 2000 students/150 faculty will attend the proposed school, an
increase of approximately 150 students from current enrollment. Figure 1 shows the location of the existing and
proposed Kellam High School.

Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. (KHA) was retained by the City to perform a traffic impact study for the
proposed development. The study area includes roadways and intersections in the vicinity of the proposed site.
The proposed site will distribute current traffic patterns, thus increasing traffic volumes along West Neck Road
and North Landing Road. More significantly than the proposed development, the projected background traffic
growth will increase the volumes of traffic along these roadways with the exception of North Landing Road.
Due to the extension of Nimmo Parkway to the east, a portion of traffic that is currently utilizing North Landing
Road will shift to Nimmo Parkway. To maintain traffic operations along the study area roadways under the
future 2015 scenario, the following improvements are recommended:

Princess Anne Road/ Holland Road
          Maintain existing laneage


Princess Anne Road/ North Landing Road
          Maintain existing laneage


North Landing Road/West Neck Road
          Maintain existing laneage
          Modify existing traffic signal timing to accommodate additional school traffic and provide
          coordination with the existing signal system.


Princess Anne Road/James Madison Boulevard
          Maintain existing laneage


Proposed North Driveway/West Neck Road/Driveway to the East
          Locate the North Driveway to align to a driveway to the east to allow for the creation of a 4-way
          intersection.

          Construct an exclusive northbound and southbound left-turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a 200
          foot taper.
          Construct an exclusive southbound right-turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a 100 foot taper.
          Construct the North Driveway to provide one ingress lane and two egress lanes to accommodate a
          separate right and left-turn lane.
          Operate intersection as STOP controlled for the side streets.
          Driveway should be a minimum of 36 feet wide with a minimum radii of 25 feet.


Proposed South Driveway/West Neck Road/Driveway to the East
          Locate the South Driveway to align to a driveway to the east to allow for the creation of a 4-Way
          intersection. (Note: the southbound left-turn will provide future access to a fourth leg and U-
          Turns).
          Construct a northbound left-turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a 100 foot taper and a
          southbound left-turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a 200 foot taper.
          Construct a southbound right-turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a 100 foot taper.
          Construct the entrance of the South Driveway to provide one ingress lane and two egress lanes to
          accommodate a separate right and left-turn lane.
          Operate intersection as STOP controlled for the side streets.
          Driveway should be a minimum of 36 feet wide with a minimum radii of 25 feet.


West Neck Road

          School Zone Flashing Beacons shall be installed along both directions of West Neck Road to warn
          vehicles of reduced speed limit.
          Construct an additional northbound and southbound through lane along the frontage of the site. A
          preliminary/conceptual layout of the improvements along both directions of West Neck Road is
          provided in the Appendix.

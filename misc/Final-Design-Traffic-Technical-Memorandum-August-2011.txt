 DESIGN TRAFFIC TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM




      Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties, FL




                 August 2011
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                                          Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E


The purpose of this Design Traffic Technical Memorandum is to provide the Florida Department
of Transportation (FDOT) District Three with the traffic information necessary to assist in making
decisions and conducting environmental evaluations related to the Pensacola Bay Bridge
Replacement Project Development and Environmental (PD&E) process. The Pensacola Bay
Bridge replacement project involves the replacement of the existing bridge located in Escambia
and Santa Rosa Counties on SR 30 (US 98) from 17th Avenue in Pensacola to Baybridge Drive in
Gulf Breeze.

The need to replace the Pensacola Bay Bridge has been established due to the deteriorating
condition of the bridge. Construction for the bridge replacement is anticipated to be complete
by 2020. This memorandum will determine if there is a need to widen the bridge from the
existing 4-lane configuration to a 6-lane configuration. Traffic forecasts were developed based
on procedures outlined in the FDOT Project Traffic Forecasting Handbook (Design Traffic
Procedure 525-030-120-f). As part of the PD&E process, future design traffic must be analyzed
to determine any capacity shortfalls.

Existing Operational Results

The results of the Existing Year 2011 bridge arterial analysis indicate that the bridge is operating
at a Level of Service (LOS) D in the AM and PM Peak Hours. The intersection of 17 th Avenue in
Pensacola is operating at a LOS D for the Existing Year 2011 PM Peak Hour.

The Pensacola Bay Bridge currently operates within Statewide Minimum LOS Standards outlined
in the 2009 FDOT Quality Level of Service Handbook. LOS D is the minimum LOS standard for
State roads located within urbanized areas under 500,000.

Future Operational Results

The Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E Project Team developed two alternatives consisting of a "Build,
4-lane" and a "Build, 6-lane" alternative. The "No Build" alternative consisted of the existing
bridge with no improvements. It was determined prior to the start of this PD&E process the No

Build is an unfavorable alternative due to rapidly deteriorating conditions compounded with
functionally obsolete characteristics. The Build 4-lane alternative modeled a 4-lane bridge
configuration and reflects operations resulting from replacing the existing bridge with a similar
4-lane structure. The Build 6-lane alternative modeled a 6-lane bridge configuration and reflects
operations resulting from replacing the current bridge with a 6-lane structure.

The Build 4-lane analysis was completed for the Opening Year 2020, the Interim Year 2030, and
the Design Year 2040 using directional design hour volumes (DDHVs). Based on the 4-lane
growth rate, the Pensacola Bay Bridge will not be operating at established LOS standards by year
2020. If brought up to current standards and replaced with 4-lanes, the bridge is projected to
operate at LOS E for Opening Year 2020 through the 2040 Design Year. By the Design Year 2040,
the intersection at 17th Avenue and US 98 will operate at LOS E, which does not meet the
established LOS standards.

The Build 6-lane analysis was completed for the Opening Year 2020, the Interim Year 2030, and
the Design Year 2040 using DDHVs. Based on the 6-lane growth rate, the Pensacola Bay Bridge
will meet established LOS standards though Design Year 2040. If replaced with 6-lanes, the
bridge is projected to operate at LOS C for Opening Year 2020 and LOS D by the 2040 Design
Year. The 17th Avenue intersection is projected to operate at LOS C or better for the 2040
Design Year for this Build alternative with additional turn-lane improvements.

Conclusions

The 2040 Design Year substandard operating conditions within the study area warrant the
widening of Pensacola Bay Bridge. The Build, 6-lane alternative, which includes a 6-lane bridge
structure, should replace the existing 4-lane configuration. Under Build, 6-lane conditions with
the additional improvements at the 17th Avenue intersection, the study intersection is expected
to operate at LOS C or better while the bridge is expected to operate at LOS D or better for the
2040 Design Year.

It should be noted the Design Traffic Technical Memorandum design year is 2040; however, the
bridge life will extend well beyond 2040, possibly to 2095. It is anticipated that traffic growth
will continue to occur between the 2040 design year and the bridge structural life expectancy.
The growth beyond the 2040 traffic design year was not included in this analysis.

1.0 INTRODUCTION                                                  Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E



1.0     INTRODUCTION
    1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Design Traffic Technical Memorandum is to provide the Florida Department
of Transportation (FDOT) District Three with the traffic information necessary to assist in making
decisions and conducting environmental evaluations related to the Pensacola Bay Bridge
Replacement Project Development and Environmental (PD&E) process. The Pensacola Bay
Bridge replacement project involves the replacement of the existing bridge located in Escambia
and Santa Rosa Counties on SR 30 (US 98) from 17th Avenue in Pensacola to Baybridge Drive in
Gulf Breeze.

This memorandum will document the following:

        The Existing traffic and safety conditions
        The Forecasting methodology for future year traffic volumes
        The design hour traffic volumes developed for the future conditions
        The traffic operations analysis for future year conditions
        The geometry and lane configuration requirements for future year conditions

    1.2 Background
The PD&E for the replacement of the Pensacola Bay Bridge #480035 started in January 2011.
This bridge replacement PD&E Study will evaluate all viable alternatives within the study area,
including possible capacity improvements. A separate project (ETDM Project #2862) considers
several bypass corridors to connect the cities of Pensacola and Gulf Breeze and is currently in
the Planning Screen. This bridge replacement project considers only the physical replacement of
the Pensacola Bay Bridge, but many of the environmental, social and economic impacts as well
as the public comments from ETDM Project #2862 may be similar.

    1.3 Project Location
The Pensacola Bay Bridge is located in Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties, Florida. The bridge
crosses Pensacola Bay to connect the cities of Pensacola and Gulf Breeze. The project limits are
State Route 30 (US 98) from 17th Avenue in Pensacola to Baybridge Drive in Gulf Breeze and the
existing bridge begins at CMP 0.00 and ends at CMP 2.967. Figure 1-1 shows the project
location.

2.0    METHODOLOGY
    2.1 Overview
The following section will summarize the methodology used in the traffic study including data
collection, traffic forecasting, design hour traffic development, level of service criteria, and
operational analysis. Additional detail is included in subsequent sections.

     2.2 Area of Influence
The Pensacola Bay Bridge provides important regional access with its connections to US 98,
Interstate 110, and the Port of Pensacola. The Bridge is also a critical link for commuters and
freight transportation from the City of Gulf Breeze and points east to the City of Pensacola and
Interstates 110 and 10. The bridge provides the primary link between the cities of Pensacola
and Gulf Breeze as well as between the coastal areas of Santa Rosa and Escambia Counties. US
98 and the Pensacola Bay Bridge is a designated hurricane evacuation route for the residents
and visitors of the Florida Panhandle. The nearest detour route around the bridge would add
approximately 27 miles to the trip length.

    2.3 Data Collection
Traffic data and other transportation data were gathered from multiple sources. The data
sources within the project study area included the following:

       FDOT Florida Traffic Online 2010
       Existing Plans, Programs and Project Lists from FDOT
       Regional Travel Demand Models

In addition, supplemental turning movement counts, roadway link volume counts, and field
measurements were collected for the study.


    2.4 Base Traffic Data and Traffic Factors
Field traffic counts provided the source of existing traffic for this study area. 72-hour bi-
directional machine counts were collected at four locations. Peak-period turning movement
counts (TMCs) were collected for two-hours in the AM and Mid-day peak-periods and four-
hours in the PM peak-period at the intersection of 17th Avenue and US 98 in Pensacola in March
of 2011. The count locations are summarized in Table 2-1, while the raw (unadjusted) traffic
counts are included in the Appendix.

      The 72-hour machine counts were converted to annual average daily traffic (AADT) by applying a
      seasonal adjustment factor of 0.94. Information from Florida Traffic Online, a website service
      provided by FDOT Transportation Statistics Office, was used to check the reasonableness of the
      existing traffic counts.

      2.4.1 Traffic Factors

      The factors used for design traffic analysis included the K30, D30, Tf. The K30 is the proportion of
      the AADT occurring during the 30th highest hour of the year. D30 is the proportion of traffic in the
      30th highest hour of the year traveling in the peak direction. The Tf factor is the percentage of
      truck traffic occurring during the peak hour and is estimated as ½ of the 24-hour truck
      percentage (T24).

      The peak hour factor (PHF) is a measure of variability of demand during the peak hour [PHF =
      peak hour volume /      (4 x peak 15-minute volume within the peak hour)]. The detailed
      methodology used to determine the traffic factors used in this study are outlined in subsequent
      sections of this memorandum. Table 2-2 summarizes the traffic factors to be used in the
      Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E Traffic Study.

          1.   Peak Hour Truck Factors are calculated as ½ the T24 and rounded to the nearest integer.


          2.5 Analysis Years
      The following analysis years have been identified for the PD&E study:

               Existing Year:    2011
               Opening Year:     2020

    2.6 Travel Demand Forecasting
The need to replace the Pensacola Bay Bridge has been established due to the deteriorating
condition of the bridge and construction for the bridge replacement is anticipated to be
complete by 2020. The purpose of the PD&E study is to determine the location of the
replacement bridge and to determine if there is a need to widen the bridge from the existing 4-
lane configuration to a 6-lane configuration. As part of the PD&E process, future design traffic
must be analyzed to determine any capacity shortfalls. The standard process used to determine
growth rates is outlined below:

    1.   Compile available forecast sources
    2.   Refine sources to include those most applicable to the study area
    3.   Develop alternatives
    4.   Select the growth rate for use in each alternative


Available Traffic Forecasting Sources

Traffic forecasts are available from a variety of sources and tools. One tool available for use in
the Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E Study Area is the Northwest Florida Regional Planning Model
(NWFRPM), formally the Florida-Alabama TPO Travel Demand Model. Travel demand models
are established by using a locally adopted Florida Standard Urban Transportation Model
Structure (FSUTMS) for the area as provided by the local Transportation Planning Organization
(TPO). In addition to the regional travel demand models, area traffic projections can be
developed from historical traffic data, socioeconomic data, historical population data, and local
sources such as the Chambers of Commerce or Economic Development Council information.
The following sources have been compiled and reviewed:

         NWFRPM Forecast
         Florida Statewide Model Forecast
         Historical Escambia Population Data
         Historical Santa Rosa Population Data
         Historical Escambia, Santa Rosa, and Okaloosa MSA Population Data
         Pensacola Bay Bridge Historical Traffic Data
         US 98 east of Gulf Breeze Historical Traffic Data



     2.7 Development of Design Traffic
The development of traffic for this study followed procedures consistent with the process
defined in the 2002 FDOT Project Traffic Forecasting Handbook. The base year and future
volume projections from the NWFRPM were converted from Peak Season Weekday Average
Daily Traffic (PSWADT) to AADTs using the Model Output Conversion Factor (MOCF). The MOCF
is 0.91 for the study area. The growth rate derived from the base year and future year model
volumes was applied to the measured AADTs and converted to Directional Design Hour Volumes
(DDHVs) through the application of the K30 and D30 factors.

     2.8 Level of Service Criteria
FDOT maintains minimum acceptable operating level of service standards for the State Highway
System. The term "level of service" (LOS) is defined with six ranges from "A" (best) to "F"
(worst) used to identify roadway facility performance. The Pensacola Bay Bridge has its own
facility designation and LOS standard.

Pensacola Bay Bridge (US 98, SR 30) is a multilane state highway facility within an urbanized area
under 500,000 in population. The established statewide minimum LOS criterion for this
designation is LOS D. The bridge also functions as a designated hurricane evacuation route.

The statewide minimum acceptable LOS standard for the roadway and intersection is outlined
below:

        Pensacola Bay Bridge: LOS D
        Study Intersection: LOS D

The established LOS standards on related roadway types within the City and County limits as
outlined within local comprehensive plans are outlined below:

      Jurisdiction                         Roadway Type                          Adopted LOS
   City of Pensacola                Non-Intrastate State Roads                         E
  City of Gulf Breeze                 Arterials (4 and 6-lane)                     E + 10%
   Escambia County                       Urbanized Arterial                           D
  Santa Rosa County          US 98 Gulf Breeze to Okaloosa County Line                D


    2.9 Analysis Procedures
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 methodologies were used for the operational analysis of
individual roadway elements, i.e., arterial segments and study intersections. The operational
analysis of the arterial segments was completed using Highway Capacity Software (HCS+)
version 5.5. The operational analysis for the study intersections and link-level arterial analysis
was completed using Synchro 7.0. The Synchro intersection analysis results documented in this
study follow the on HCM methodologies.

  Pensacola Bay Bridge (US 98) is an east-west uninterrupted flow highway with a functional
  classification of urban principal arterial and is an integral part of both the state and US Highways
  system. The bridge is currently a four-lane divided facility with a posted speed limit of 45 miles
  per hour (mph). The AADT on the bridge is approximately 55,000 vehicles.

  17th Avenue is a 2-lane undivided urban collector with a posted speed limit of 35 mph. 17th
  Avenue serves mainly residential and small commercial areas and carries an AADT ranging from
  15,000 to 20,000 vehicles.

  East Gregory Street is a one-way 2-lane undivided principal arterial with a posted speed limit of
  45 mph. East Gregory Street primarily serves commercial development and provides the primary
  route to I-110 from Pensacola Bay Bridge and carries an AADT ranging from 15,000 to 20,000
  vehicles on two lanes one way.

  Bayfront Parkway is a 4-lane divided urban principal arterial with a posted speed limit of 45
  mph. Bayfront Parkway primarily serves commercial developments and provides access to and
  from downtown Pensacola and carries an AADT ranging from 25,000 to 30,000.

    3.2 Crash Analysis
The purpose of this section is to analyze the crash history on Pensacola Bay Bridge From 17th
Avenue in Pensacola to Baybridge Drive in Gulf Breeze. The results of the analysis represent the
latest trends in police reported motor vehicle crashes along the corridor.

The summary crash data was obtained from the FDOT Crash Analysis Reporting system (CAR) for
years 2005 through 2009. Because comparing crash data by individual years may distort analysis
results, five years of data was analyzed to account for anomalies caused by outside influence
such as construction projects. All crashes resulting in a vehicle being towed away, personal
injury, or fatality are documented on Long Form crash reports and reported to the Department
of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. Long Form crash reports are submitted to the FDOT
where they are then uploaded to the CAR database. The critical analysis factors identified from
CAR were:

    1.   Number and Type of Crashes
    2.   Severity
    3.   Crash Identification by Segment
    4.   Crash Rates

Results of the analysis may be used to determine the existence of any crash related trends. A
goal was not only to report the information, but also to indicate the potential for a particular
kind of system improvement or regulation change, and would be part of the concept
development of the overall PD&E process.

             3.2.1      Data Sources

The following information was used to review the corridor crash statistics.

Crash Data: CAR data by segments for years 2005 through 2009 for the corridor was obtained
from the FDOT Safety Office.

Geographic Information System (GIS): ArcMap software was used to display multiple layers of
crash data to determine geographical crash densities and visually compare individual segments.

Roadway Characteristics Inventory (RCI): Roadway information including area type and AADT
was reviewed.

             3.2.2      Overview of Method and Results

Crash counts and crash rates were the two primary elements reviewed because this data most
accurately reflects the crash patterns along the corridor. Crash counts show specific numbers of
crashes that have occurred on a given segment within a given timeframe. Crash rates account
for segment length, average daily traffic (ADT), timeframe, and crash occurrences.

Utilizing the available data provided through CAR, GIS and RCI, crash rates were organized and
compared to average statewide rates. Average statewide rates are calculated in terms of
crashes per million vehicle miles traveled (MVMT).

   Below outlines how the crash rate is calculated:

   Crash Rate = ( crash count * 108 ) / exposure

   Where,
   Exposure = Average Daily Traffic × 365 × Time Period in years × Length of Segment (in miles)


       1. GIS shape files for the number of crashes were created and compiled into ArcMap.
          ArcMap was the primary tool used for image evaluation.

       2. Results were organized by average crash occurrences, crash type, severity, and time of
          incident.

   Table 3-2 shows the crash analysis summary for each year over the past five years and the 5-
   year average crash rate for Pensacola Bay Bridge and for the FDOT statewide average crash rate.

    3.3 Existing Traffic Volumes

              3.3.1     Daily Traffic
Field traffic counts provided the source of existing traffic for this study area. 72-hour bi-
directional machine counts were collected at four locations in March of 2011. These raw traffic
counts were adjusted using a seasonal adjustment factor to obtain 2011 AADT volumes, which
were used to assess the current operating conditions along the study corridor. Table 3-4
summarizes the AADTs calculated for the Existing Year (2011).

              3.3.2      Turning Movement Counts
Two-hour AM and Mid-day peak-period and four-hour PM peak-period turning movement
counts (TMCs) were collected at the 17th Avenue intersection in Pensacola in March of 2011.
The counts, tabulated in 15-minute increments, were used to determine the peak hour traffic
volumes. The Existing Year 2011 peak hours were found to be 7:30-8:30 AM and 4:45-5:45 PM.
The traffic counts are provided in the Appendix.

    3.4 Existing Operating Conditions
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 methodologies were used for the operational analysis of
arterial segments and study intersections. The operational analysis of the arterial segments was
completed using Highway Capacity Software (HCS+) version 5.5. The operational analysis for the
study intersections and link-level arterial analysis was completed using Synchro 7.0. The Synchro
intersection analysis results documented in this study follow the on HCM methodologies.

The results of the Existing Year 2011 operational analysis is discussed in the following section.
Analysis worksheets for the Existing Year 2011 analysis is provided in the Appendix.

             3.4.1       Bridge Arterial Analysis
The results of the Existing Year 2011 bridge arterial analysis are summarized in Table 3-5. In the
existing conditions, the bridge segment on US 98 between Gulf Breeze and Pensacola operates
at acceptable LOS D or better in both the AM and PM peak hours.

4.0      TRAFFIC FORECASTS
Traffic forecasts were developed based on procedures outlined in the FDOT Project Traffic
Forecasting Handbook (Design Traffic Procedure 525-030-120-f). As part of the PD&E process,
future design traffic must be analyzed to determine any capacity shortfalls. The standard
process used to determine growth rates and develop design traffic is outlined below:

    1.   Compile available forecast sources
    2.   Refine sources to include those most applicable to the study area
    3.   Develop alternatives
    4.   Selection of the growth rate for use in the study

Once available sources have been compiled and refined to include those most applicable to the
study area, a range of growth rates from low to high will be demonstrated. However, a single
growth rate applicable to each alternative will be determined from this process and used in the
traffic analysis portion of this memorandum.


Available Traffic Forecasting Sources

Traffic forecasts are available from a variety of sources and tools. One tool available for use in
the Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E Study Area is the Northwest Florida Regional Planning Model
(NWFRPM) version 1.1. Travel demand models are established by using a locally adopted
Florida Standard Urban Transportation Model Structure (FSUTMS) for the area as provided by
the local Transportation Planning Organization (TPO). In addition to the regional travel demand
models, area traffic projections can be developed from historical traffic data, socioeconomic
data, historical population data, or other data from local sources such as the Chambers of
Commerce or Economic Development Council. The following sources have been compiled and
reviewed:

         NWFRPM Forecast (formally Florida-Alabama TPO Model)
         Florida Statewide Model Forecast
         Historical Escambia Population Data
         Historical Santa Rosa Population Data
         Historical Escambia, Santa Rosa, and Okaloosa MSA Population Data
         Pensacola Bay Bridge Historical Traffic Data
         US 98 east of Gulf Breeze Historical Traffic Data

Figure 4-1 provides a comparison of the individual rates associated with the sources outlined
above. Further refinement of the growth rates are outlined in subsequent sections of this
memorandum.

Travel demand models include detailed socioeconomic data such as population, housing, and
land use characteristics. In addition to socioeconomic data, capital improvements currently
adopted in the cost feasible Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) are included in the future
year network. The base model year for the NWFRPM is 2006 and the cost feasible design year
was extrapolated from 2035 to 2040.

In addition to model volumes, FDOT maintains a permanent count site (#580261) located on US
98, west of Baybridge Drive in Gulf Breeze. Permanent count sites continuously monitor and
record traffic and provide an accurate account of historical traffic.

There is a significant amount of variation among the sources outlined in Figure 4-1. The most
conservative (or lowest growth) sources include the NWFRPM growth forecasts and historical
traffic data. These sources are also the most applicable to the bridge itself.

It should be noted model volumes are projected from the base year, which is the most recent
validation year, and historical traffic volumes are projected from 2010. The traffic projections

   from the past fifteen years of traffic data.


       4.1 Alternatives Development

                4.1.1      No Build Alternative

   The No Build alternative represents the "do nothing" scenario in the Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E
   study. Under this alternative, the existing bridge would remain in place and undergo
   maintenance as needed. It should be noted the need for this study was determined largely on
   the part of the degrading structural condition, sufficiency ratings, and functional characteristics
   of the existing bridge. The existing bridge does not currently meet State sufficiency standards
   and is approaching Federal thresholds. Furthermore, the existing roadway does not meet
   current design standards and lacks alternative modes of transportation.

   The existing structure was constructed in 1960 with a 50-year structural design life. The 51 year
   old bridge requires millions of dollars in annual maintenance costs, which are anticipated to
   increase as the bridge further ages beyond its design life. Rapidly deteriorating conditions
   compounded with functionally obsolete characteristics and safety concerns render this
   alternative unfavorable.


                4.1.2      Build Alternatives

   The need to replace the bridge has been established prior to the start of this PD&E process. The
   location of the replacement bridge will be determined later in the study, therefore, the
   immediate purpose of this document is to determine if there is a need to widen the bridge from
   the existing 4-lane configuration to 6-lanes.

   The tables below represent growth rates on the Pensacola Bay Bridge for two alternatives
   included in the PD&E study. The growth rate and associated AADT's for the first alternative,
   Build, 4-lane, is depicted in Table 4-1 and is based on the cost feasible (CF) adopted NWFRPM
   maintaining a 4-lane bridge configuration through 2040. Table 4-2 represents a 6-lane bridge
   configuration through 2040, or future Build 6-lane alternative, where Pensacola Bay Bridge is
   widened within the NWFRPM CF Model.

   The model rates fall between other comparative source growth rates and represent
   socioeconomic data, land use changes, and historic traffic and therefore, are recommended for
   adoption for use in the Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E Study. This recommendation further limits
   the amount of manipulation that would occur if a method of averaging rates were applied.

    4.2 Model Development
This section will describe the development and validation of the base year model, compilation of
socioeconomic data for future year model runs and documentation of the area of influence.

The approved travel demand model for this study is the NWFRPM, which has a base year of
2006 and a CF horizon year of 2035, extrapolated to 2040. The recommended annual growth
rate is 0.64%. The following is a summary of the traffic forecasting procedure, which was used
in the study:

       Model Development
        o Model future roadway network
       Future Traffic Forecasts
        o Review raw model volumes for reasonableness (any unusual volume variations and
            their cause will be documented)
        o Post processing of model volumes where necessary (any post processing applied to
            raw model volumes will be documented)
        o Development of design hour volumes using K30 and D30 factors

             4.2.1     Model Review and Validation

An assessment was conducted of the recently released NWFRPM Version 1.1 to ascertain its
effectiveness and reasonableness as a traffic forecasting tool for this study. The NWFRPM is a
regional travel demand model developed and maintained primarily as a travel demand
forecasting tool to support the Long Range Transportation Plan updates of the TPOs within the
District. The NWFRPM includes the West Florida Regional Planning Council (WFRPC) area that
comprises three major urbanized areas and a number of rural Counties as follows: Florida-
Alabama Transportation Planning Organization (FATPO), which includes Escambia and Santa
Rosa Counties as well as a portion of Baldwin County in Alabama, the Okaloosa-Walton
Transportation Planning Organization (TPO), Bay County TPO, Holmes, and Washington
Counties. Outside the Regional Planning Council area the NWFRPM also includes Jackson,
Calhoun, Gulf, Franklin and Wakulla Counties. The NWFRPM includes a 2006 Base Year and a
2035 Forecast Year.

The NWFRPM was analyzed to assess whether the model is replicating travel patterns in the
study area of influence at a reasonable and acceptable level. The primary measure used to
assess the performance of the 2006 Base model was volume to count ratios. Peak Season
Weekday Average Daily Traffic (PSWADT) volumes produced by the NWFRPM were converted to
AADT and compared to traffic counts collected for this study as well as traffic counts provided
by FDOT. The FDOT Project Traffic Forecasting Handbook indicates:

        "Differences in volume in excess of 10% in high volume areas...should be further
                         evaluated in an effort to explain the disparity."

                            2006 Base Year Model Validation
              2006 TPO Model (AADT for the Bridge)                     56,863
              2006 FDOT Count (AADT for the Bridge)                    52,855
              Difference                                                 7%

4.0 TRAFFIC FORECASTS                                             Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E



A seven (7) percent difference in the 2006 base year volume when compared to the 2006 FDOT
count for Pensacola Bay Bridge falls within reasonable levels as outlined within the Project
Traffic Forecasting Handbook. The results of this assessment reveal that the NWFRPM is
replicating travel patterns at an acceptable level in the area of influence. This is a logical
conclusion supported by the fact that the NWFRPM was recently updated and validated prior to
its release.

A review of the 2035 Cost Feasible Network model run was also conducted to assess the
reasonableness of future traffic projections in the area of influence. Associated 2006 and 2035
socioeconomic data developed for the area of the NWFRPM was also reviewed as part of this
assessment to ascertain whether population and employment growth was reasonable as
compared to traffic growth.


             4.2.2      Socioeconomic (SE) Data Development

The base SE data used in the NWFRPM for this study was developed by FDOT in coordination
with the TPOs within District Three as part of their recent Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP)
updates. FDOT provided SE data for the 2006 base year as well as the 2035 forecast year. Figure
4-3 represents the Pensacola Bay Bridge area of influence.

                                  Figure 4-3 Area of Influence




Base SE data within the area of influence was extrapolated to 2040 from 2035. Analysis of the
population and employment growth between 2006 and 2040 reveals growth in population of
136,000 and an increase of 48,000 employees. Table 4-3 depicts the total population and
employment for both the base year and future cost feasible year. The increase in SE activity falls
in line with what was produced by the model traffic projections.

           4.3 Future Traffic Forecasts
      Design Year 2040 traffic forecasts were produced for a Build 4-lane bridge and a Build 6-lane
      bridge. Model runs were conducted for the base year and future year and resulting PSWADTs
      were converted to AADTs and reviewed for reasonableness. Upon successful review, the
      NWFRPM 2035 CF Model volumes were extrapolated to estimate the Design Year 2040 AADTs.
      The NWFRPM growth rate was then used to obtain future traffic forecasts for Opening Year
      2020, Interim Year 2030, and Design Year 2040 through application to the project measured
      traffic counts. The traffic forecasts were developed for Pensacola Bay Bridge and the signalized
      intersection at 17th Avenue in Pensacola for this PD&E study. Table 4-4 shows the comparison
      between the existing year 2011 AADTs and the future Build 4-lane AADTs.

    4.4 Development of Design Traffic
The purpose of this section is to identify the K30, D30, and T24 factors to be used in developing
design traffic volumes for the Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E Study.

Recommended Traffic Factors

The traffic factors recommended for use in this study are summarized in Table 4-5 below. The
methodology used to develop these factors is discussed in subsequent sections of this
memorandum.

    1. Peak Hour Truck Factors are calculated as ½ the T24


K30 Factor Development

The K30 factor is the proportion of the AADT occurring during the 30th highest hour of the year.
The K30 factor was developed using statewide and national guidelines and historical K30 trends.

Acceptable K30 Values

FDOT defines an acceptable range of K30 values in the FDOT Project Traffic Forecasting Handbook
(2002). These values are categorized by roadway type. Similarly, the Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM) 2000 defines a range of K30 values from high to low by roadway type. These values are
presented in Table 4-6.

The K30 values listed above are presented for comparison to the Pensacola Bay Bridge historical
K30 factors and to ensure that the recommended project K30 value is within the acceptable range
of values.


Historical K30 Trends

The historical K30 trends were examined for the Pensacola Bay Bridge study area. The factors
recorded at this location over an eleven-year (2000 ­ 2010) period were obtained from the 2010

Bridge reported in this memorandum is located directly on the
Pensacola Bay Bridge (Site 580261). A TTMS site records traffic
24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This provides the most
accurate and precise data available and should be noted when
compared to FDOT and HCM averages.

Review of the historical K30 values in the project area show
only slight fluctuations over the past eleven years. The extent
of the historical data showed K30 values ranging from 9.40 to
9.73, which fall within the acceptable range of K30 values. The
historical K30 data for 2000 to 2010 is provided in Table 4-7.

value of 9.50% is recommended. This value represents the average historical K30 and falls in line
with both FDOT and HCM acceptable ranges.

D30 Factor Development

The D30 factor represents the proportion of the two-way design hour traffic volume that is
traveling in the peak direction. The D30 factor was obtained using the following procedures. The
D30 factor was developed using state-wide guidelines, historical D30 trends, and project traffic
counts.

Acceptable D30 Values

FDOT defines an acceptable range of D30 values in the FDOT Project Traffic Forecasting
Handbook (2002). These values are categorized by roadway type. Similarly, HCM 2000 defines a
range of D30 from high to low by roadway type. These values are presented in Table 4-9.

As shown in the above table, the historical D30 values for Pensacola Bay Bridge range from 52.90
to 60.30. These values were compared with the acceptable D30 values for urban arterials from
the FDOT Project Traffic Forecasting Handbook (2002). The historical D30 values on the bridge
fall within both HCM and FDOT range of acceptable values.


Project Calculated DPH

DPH is the proportion of the two-way peak hour traffic traveling in the peak direction as
calculated from the collected project counts. A DPH value was calculated for the location where a
72-hour continuous count was conducted. This count took place on Pensacola Bay Bridge.

The calculated DPH value on the bridge was 54.46. The calculated DPH value and associated
traffic are shown in Table 4-11.

The historical D30 values and project calculated DPH factors for Pensacola Bay Bridge are within
the FDOT acceptable range of D30 values. The highest historical D30 is slightly higher than
acceptable High HCM levels. However, this value is an outlier when compared to the remaining
historical years reviewed.

The average of the historical D30 values and the DPH value was calculated to determine the
recommended D30 value of 55.10% for Pensacola Bay Bridge.

T24 and Tf Factors

The daily truck factor, T24, is the percentage of truck traffic in the total traffic stream for 24
hours (one day). The peak hour truck factor, Tf, is the percentage of truck traffic during the peak
hour and is typically calculated as one half (1/2) of the T24 factor. The T24 factors recorded at this
location over an eleven-year period was obtained from the 2010 Florida Traffic Online site.

The historical T24 trends were examined for Pensacola Bay Bridge. A summary of the observed
T24 factors is provided in Table 4-13.

In addition to the historical data, a T24 value was calculated from the location on Pensacola Bay
Bridge where a 72-hour classification count was collected. The average daily truck factor
calculated from this location was 2.25.

Based on the observations above, the recommended T24 for Pensacola Bay Bridge is 4.00%,
which produces a Tf of 2.00%.

Peak Hour Factor Development

The peak hour factor (PHF) is a measure of variability of demand during the peak hour PHF [PHF
= peak hour volume / (4 x peak 15-minute volume within the peak hour)]. Existing PHFs were
derived from the project traffic counts obtained in March of 2011. The PHFs used for the
existing conditions analysis ranged from 0.83 to 0.96. According to the 2009 FDOT Quality/Level
of Service Handbook, a PHF of 0.92 is standard for urbanized areas. Based on observed PHFs for
the existing conditions, a recommended PHF for Pensacola Bay Bridge is 0.92.

      The results of the future bridge level of service analysis are summarized in Table 5-2. The Peak
      volume is the calculated DDHV and is used in determining design requirements. By 2020,
      Pensacola Bay Bridge operates at LOS E during peak conditions, not consistent with established
      LOS standards. LOS E is maintained through the 2040 Design Year.

6.0     Summary of Build 4-lane Alternative

The results of the 4-lane alternative operational analysis are discussed in the following section.
Additional documentation is provided in the Appendix. An operational summary is outlined
below:

Bridge Arterial Analysis

Existing Year 2011 Arterial Analysis
In the existing conditions, Pensacola Bay Bridge operates within acceptable LOS standards
during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Opening Year 2020 through 2040 Arterial Analysis
By 2020, Pensacola Bay Bridge will operate at LOS E, not meeting established LOS standards.

Intersection Analysis

Existing Year 2011 Intersection Analysis
Under the existing conditions, the study intersection at 17th Avenue operates within acceptable
LOS standards during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Opening Year 2020 Intersection Analysis
In 2020, the study intersection at 17th Avenue is expected to operate at LOS C in the AM and PM
peak hours. The improved condition during the PM peak hour is due to signal optimization.

Interim Year 2030 Intersection Analysis
In 2030, the study intersection at 17th Avenue is expected to operate at LOS D in the PM peak
hour.

Design Year 2040 Intersection Analysis
In 2040, the study intersection at 17th Avenue is expected to operate at LOS D and E in the AM
and PM peak hours, respectively. Extended approach delays during PM Peak conditions due to
lack of available capacity results in poor intersection conditions.

          7.1 Operational Analysis
      The results of the 6-lane Build alternative operational analysis are discussed in the following
      section. Additional documentation for the analysis is provided in the Appendix.


                    7.1.1      Bridge Arterial Analysis

      Table 7-1 shows the future AADTs using the Build 6-lane growth rate. The future AADTS were
      converted to directional design hour volumes (DDHVs) by applying the traffic factors outlined in
      previous sections of this report.

      The results of the future bridge level of service analysis are summarized in Table 7-2. The Peak
      volume is the calculated DDHV and is used in determining design requirements. Pensacola Bay
      Bridge operates adequately by maintaining the established LOS standards through 2040 for the
      Peak direction.

               7.1.2      Intersection Analysis

The future intersection analysis is summarized in Table 7-3. By 2040, the study intersection will
operate at LOS F, not consistent with established LOS standards. Following the interim 2030
year, additional improvements will be needed at the 17th Avenue intersection, which are
outlined following the table. Figures 7-1 through 7-3 depict the AADT, peak hour volumes, and
operational results. Figures 7-5 through 7-7 depict the lane configuration requirements per
analysis year.

    1. Delay = seconds/vehicle
    2. Results Include Improvements

In the Design Year, the study intersection at 17th Avenue is expected to fail (LOS F) in both peak
hours without additional improvements. The following at-grade improvements are necessary to
achieve acceptable LOS in the design year:

        Add second eastbound left turn lane (dual lefts)
        Add second southbound right turn lane (dual rights)
        Add third southbound left turn lane (triple lefts)

The Operational analysis depicts queues building on 17th Avenue restricting southbound
intersection approach movements. Without the additional turn lanes, queues are anticipated to
extend to lengths limiting motorist's ability to access turning lanes increasing both movement
and total intersection delays to failing levels. Additional storage further reduces turning
movement green times allowing more time to be allocated for US 98 through movements.

Under Build 6-lane conditions with the additional improvements listed above, the study
intersection is expected to operate at LOS C in the AM and LOS B in the PM peak hour. Peak
hour volumes and LOS for Design Year 2040 Build are shown in Figure 7-3.

It should be noted the study intersection is located within the City of Pensacola's designated
Urban Redevelopment Transportation Concurrency Exception Area (TCEA). At this time, only at-
grade improvements have been provided to mitigate traffic demand at the 17th Avenue
intersection. The City shall continue to examine traffic impacts associated with the
development of roadways to ensure that adopted LOS standards are not degraded.

             7.1.3     Build 6-lane Traffic Information Worksheets for Air and Noise
The traffic information worksheets for air quality and noise quality analysis have been
completed for the year 2040 and include AADT's, posted speeds and number of lanes. This
worksheet can be found in Figure 7-4.

8.0 Summary of Build 6-Lane Alternative                           Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E


8.0     Summary of Build 6-lane Alternative
The findings of the 6-lane Build growth alternative are discussed in the following section. In the
future year, the Pensacola Bay Bridge is widened from four to six lanes through the study
intersection. Under Build conditions, additional intersection improvements are recommended
where necessary to achieve acceptable LOS. Documentation for the existing conditions analysis
is provided in the Appendix.

Bridge Arterial Analysis

Existing Year 2011 Arterial Analysis
In the existing conditions, Pensacola Bay Bridge operates within acceptable LOS standards
during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Opening Year 2020 through 2040 Arterial Analysis
Opening Year 2020, Pensacola Bay Bridge will operate at LOS C conditions, meeting established
LOS standards. By 2040, Pensacola Bay Bridge will operate at LOS D during peak conditions,
meeting standards through the Design Year.

Intersection Analysis

Existing Year 2011 Intersection Analysis
Under the existing conditions, the study intersection at 17th Avenue operates within acceptable
LOS standards during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Opening Year 2020 Intersection Analysis
In 2020, the study intersection at 17th Avenue is expected to operate at LOS C in the AM and PM
peak hours.

Interim Year 2030 Intersection Analysis
In 2030, the study intersection at 17th Avenue is expected to operate at LOS D in the AM and PM
peak hours.

Design Year 2040 Intersection Analysis
In the Design Year, the study intersection at 17th Avenue is expected to fail (LOS F) in both peak
hours without additional improvements. The following improvements are necessary to achieve
acceptable LOS in the design year:

        Add second eastbound left turn lane (dual lefts)
        Add second southbound right turn lane (dual rights)
        Add third southbound left turn lane (triple lefts)

Under Build 6-lane conditions with the additional improvements listed above, the intersection is
expected to operate at LOS C in the AM and LOS B in PM peak hour conditions.

9.0 RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS                                       Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E



9.0     RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The purpose of this Design Traffic Technical Memorandum is to provide the FDOT District Three
with the traffic information necessary to assist in making decisions and conducting
environmental evaluations related to the Pensacola Bay Bridge Replacement Project
Development and Environmental (PD&E) process. The Pensacola Bay Bridge replacement project
involves the replacement of the existing bridge located in Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties on
SR 30 (US 98) from 17th Avenue in Pensacola to Baybridge Drive in Gulf Breeze.

The need to replace the Pensacola Bay Bridge has been established due to the deteriorating
condition of the bridge. Construction for the bridge replacement is anticipated to be complete
by 2020. This memorandum evaluates whether or not there is a need to widen the bridge from
the existing 4-lane configuration to a 6-lane configuration. Traffic forecasts were developed
based on procedures outlined in the FDOT Project Traffic Forecasting Handbook (Design Traffic
Procedure 525-030-120-f). As part of the PD&E process, future design traffic must be analyzed
to determine any capacity shortfalls.

The study documented the following:

        Existing traffic and safety conditions
        The methodology used to forecast future year volumes
        The design hour traffic volumes developed for the future conditions
        The traffic operations analysis for future year conditions
        Summary of geometry requirements for 2040 future year conditions

The substandard operating conditions within the PD&E study area by the 2040 Design Year
warrant the widening of Pensacola Bay Bridge. The Build alternative, which includes a 6-lane
bridge structure, should replace the existing 4-lane configuration. Under the Build 6-lane
conditions with the additional improvements at the 17th Avenue intersection, the study
intersection is expected to operate at LOS C or better while the bridge is expected to operate at
LOS D or better for the 2040 Design Year.

It should be noted the Design Traffic Technical Memorandum design year is 2040; however, the
bridge life will extend well beyond 2040, possibly to 2095. It is anticipated that traffic growth
will continue to occur between the 2040 design year and the bridge structural life expectancy.
The growth beyond the 2040 traffic design year was not included in this analysis.

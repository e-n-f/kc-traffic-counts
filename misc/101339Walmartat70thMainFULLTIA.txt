        CHAPTER I ­ INTRODUCTION & EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
PART A ­ PURPOSE OF REPORT AND STUDY OBJECTIVES
A Walmart Market is proposed to be located southwest of the South 70th Street intersection with
West Main Street in the City of Milwaukee. To ensure a safe and efficient roadway network
upon completion of the store, Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc. conducted this traffic impact
analysis (TIA) to determine the expected weekday evening and Saturday midday peak hour
operating conditions and recommendations at the study area intersections both with and without
the proposed development.
This report documents the procedures, findings and conclusions of the TIA. The analysis
identifies recommended improvements based on existing intersection geometrics, background
traffic volumes, and additional traffic expected to be generated by the Walmart Market.
PART B ­ STUDY AREA & DEVELOPMENT DESCRIPTION
The executive summary includes a description of the study area, description of the development
and conclusions based on the findings of the TIA.
B1. Location of Study Site with Respect to Area Roadway Network
A street map illustrating the location of the proposed Walmart Market is shown in Exhibit 1-1 at
the end of this chapter. A copy of the conceptual site plan is shown in Exhibit 1-2. The study
area includes the following existing intersections:
        Main Street & 76th Street (traffic signal);
     Main Street & 75 Street (two-way stop control);
                           th

     Main Street & 74 Street (two-way stop control):
                           th

     Main Street & 73 Street (two-way stop control);
                           rd

     Main Street & 72 Street (two-way stop control);
                           nd

     Main Street & 71 Street (two-way stop control);
                           st

     Main Street & Public Alley (two-way stop control);
     Main Street & 70 Street (traffic signal control); and
                           th

     70 Street & Dickinson Street (two-way stop control).
           th

Access points to the Walmart Market are discussed later in this chapter and are also referred to as
study area intersections.
The proposed development site is an unutilized, deteriorated parking lot bound by Main Street to
the north, 72nd Street to the west, a multi-use trail (former railroad) to the south, and a public
alley to the east. Jetz gas station/convenience store, Air Comfort Systems, Krause Auto Body,
and other small commercial businesses are located between the public alley and the west side of
70th Street. Residential neighborhoods are located along the north side of Main Street, and
Roman Electric is located along the east side of 70th Street.
B2. On-Site Development Description
The Walmart Market is to be a 39,994 square foot (sf) grocery store with drive-thru pharmacy.
No developable outlots are proposed. This traffic study assumes the store will be constructed
and operational in Year 2011.
Vehicular access to the Walmart Market site is proposed to be located along Main Street
opposite 71st Street (west access), along 70th Street approximately halfway between Main Street
and Dickinson Street (north access), and along 70th Street opposite Dickinson Street (south
The Walmart Market - Milwaukee, Wisconsin                                           March 31, 2011

access). An existing north-south alley that intersects Main Street between 71st Street and 70th
Street will remain. Note that the Krause Auto Body building and the two business buildings
south of Jetz gas station/convenience store will be removed to accommodate the access points to
70th Street. Jetz gas station/convenience store and the Air Comfort Systems business will
remain.
Pedestrian connections are planned for the Walmart Market to/from both Main Street and 70th
Street. Bicycle racks are also planned, as is a connection to the multi-use trail to the south.
Milwaukee County Transit Service Route 76, which connects Brown Deer, Milwaukee, West
Allis, Greenfield and Greendale, currently travels along both 70th Street and 76th Street within the
study area and will be operationally unaffected by the Walmart Market. Note that Route 44 ­
National Flyer and Route 44U ­ Fairpark-Whitnall UBUS also travel along 76th Street and will
be operationally unaffected by the Walmart Market.
B3. Off-Site Development Description
No planned off-site development was identified. Note that the City of Milwaukee plans to
reconstruct 70th Street and resurface Main Street in Year 2011.
B4. Site Generated Traffic
Traffic volumes expected to be generated by the Walmart Market are based on the type and
density of the proposed land use, and on trip rates as published in the Institute of Transportation
Engineer's (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition, 2008. This manual is accepted in
Wisconsin and the rest of the country as the industry standard in estimating trips to/from various
land uses ­ including grocery stores like the Walmart Market.
The proposed Walmart Market is expected to generate approximately 125 new trips to/from the
study area during a typical weekday morning peak hour (80 in/45 out), 340 new trips to/from the
study area during a typical weekday evening peak hour (175 in/165 out) and 350 new trips to/from
the study area during a typical Saturday midday peak hour (180 in/170 out). On a typical weekday
(24 hour period), the Walmart Market is expected to generate approximately 3,270 new trips
(1,635 in/1,635 out).
Based on discussions with Walmart Market Operations, the Walmart Market site is expected to be
serviced by between 15 and 20 delivery vehicles on a given day. The deliveries are distributed
throughout the day for logistical purposes. All trucks to/from the Walmart Market will be
accommodated and focused at the south access along 70th Street.
PART C ­ RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS
C1. Level of Service Definition
The study area intersections were analyzed based on the procedures set forth in the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). This manual is accepted in Wisconsin and the rest of the
country as the industry standard in estimating operations at both signalized and unsignalized
intersections.
Intersection operation is defined by "level of service" (LOS), a quantitative measure that refers
to the overall quality of flow at an intersection ranging from very good, represented by LOS `A',
to very poor, represented by LOS `F'. LOS D or better operations (fewer than 35-seconds of
average vehicle delay at stop sign controlled intersections, fewer than 55-seconds of average
vehicle delay at traffic signal controlled intersections) are defined as acceptable peak hour
operating conditions.

The Walmart Market - Milwaukee, Wisconsin                                             March 31, 2011

C2. Year 2011 Background Traffic Recommended Improvements
The Year 2011 background traffic analysis assumes the Walmart Market does not occur. The
analysis was conducted using existing intersection geometrics, traffic controls and signal
timings. Based on the capacity analysis, no improvements are necessary to accommodate
operations under background traffic volumes. Traffic signalized intersections operate acceptably
at LOS C or better conditions. Stop-sign controlled intersections along Main Street operate
acceptably at LOS B or better conditions.
Note that the City of Milwaukee should consider replacing the bridge rail along the east side of
70th Street, south of Dickinson Street, with a more see-through solution to improve sight-distance
for motorists currently turning from Dickinson Street onto 70th Street. This improvement, which
is not related to the Walmart Market in any way, would address an existing sight distance
concern for the neighborhood east of 70th Street.
C3. Year 2011 Total Traffic Recommended Improvements
Year 2011 total traffic volumes assume the full build-out of the Walmart Market. The following
improvements, shown in Exhibit 1-3, are recommended to accommodate the Year 2011 total
traffic.
       Main Street & 76th Street
               No improvements are anticipated to be necessary.
       Main Street & 75th Street
               No improvements are anticipated to be necessary.
       Main Street & 74th Street
               No improvements are anticipated to be necessary.
       Main Street & 73rd Street
               No improvements are anticipated to be necessary.
       Main Street & 72nd Street
               No improvements are anticipated to be necessary.
       Main Street & 71st Street/Proposed West Access
               Construct the Walmart Market west access on the south side of Main Street
               opposite 71st Street. No exclusive turn lanes are necessary.
               Install a stop sign to control the Walmart Market northbound approach. Note that
               "DO NOT ENTER" signs currently exist along the north side of Main Street to
               inform motorists exiting the site that 71st Street is one-way southbound only.
       Main Street & Public Alley
               Install a stop sign to control the public alley northbound approach.
       Main Street & 70th Street
               No improvements are anticipated to be necessary.

The Walmart Market - Milwaukee, Wisconsin                                            March 31, 2011

       70th Street & Proposed North Access
               Construct the Walmart Market north access on the west side of 70th Street
               approximately half-way between Main Street and Dickinson Street. No exclusive
               turn lanes are necessary.
               Install a stop sign to control the Walmart Market eastbound approach.
       70th Street & Proposed South Access
               Construct the Walmart Market south access on the west side of 70th Street
               opposite Dickinson Street. No exclusive turn lanes are necessary.
               Install a stop sign to control the Walmart Market eastbound approach. Note that
               poor sight-distance exists at the access looking south for passenger vehicles, but
               not for delivery trucks, due to the height of the existing bridge abutment/railing on
               the west side of 70th Street. Install a MUTCD-compliant "RIGHT-TURN
               ONLY" sign with an additional sign stating "EXCEPT DELIVERY TRUCKS" to
               improve the safety of the intersection.
       General Improvements
               Recall that the Jetz gas station/convenience store and Air Comfort Systems
               business are expected to remain when the Walmart Market access points to 70th
               Street are constructed. Both businesses, as well as the Roman Electric business
               on the east side of 70th Street, have off-site parking accommodations.
               Consideration may be given to removing parking on the west side of 70th Street to
               improve visibility for motorists exiting the Walmart Market, Jetz, and HVAC
               sites. Consideration may also be given to removing parking on the south side of
               Main Street along the Walmart Market property to improve visibility for motorists
               exiting the west access and the existing public alley.
The traffic-signalized intersections are expected to continue to operate acceptably at LOS C or
better conditions. Stop-sign controlled intersections along Main Street are expected to continue
to operate acceptably at LOS B or better conditions. These operations make sense, as 1) Main
Street currently services low volumes of traffic to/from the neighborhoods to the north and 2) the
Walmart Market site adds a relatively low incremental increase in traffic to Main Street. Traffic
exiting the north access along 70th Street is expected to operate acceptably at LOS D or better
conditions, and traffic exiting the south access along 70th Street is expected to operate acceptably
at LOS B or better conditions.
PART D ­ NEIGHBORHOOD CONCERNS
A public information meeting (PIM) was conducted for the Walmart Market site at Juneau High
School on February 28th, 2011. Representatives of the property owner, representatives of
Walmart Market, and representatives of the City of Milwaukee were present to take note of the
concerns of the surrounding residents. This section of the report is provided to address traffic-
related concerns raised at the meeting that relate to the Walmart Market.
D1. Truck Traffic on Main Street
Residents at the February PIM stated they had concerns with Walmart delivery truck traffic
along Main Street, as well as truck headlights directed northbound into homes. Note that the
conceptual site plan at the time included a truck access along Main Street between 71st Street and
72nd Street, as well as loading docks along the west side of the building with trucks positioned
facing north towards Main Street.
Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc.                                                                     4
The Walmart Market - Milwaukee, Wisconsin                                             March 31, 2011

To address this concern, the latest Walmart Market site plan has been reconfigured in a manner
that will only accommodate delivery trucks along 70th Street. More specifically, the loading
docks have been placed along the south side of the proposed building with trucks positioned
facing south, the truck access along Main Street between 71st Street and 72nd Street has been
removed, and the internal site layout is such that delivery trucks will not be able to physically
make turns within the site to reach Main Street. With the IH-94 interchange with 70th Street to
the north, truck drivers will not use Main Street to reach their destinations since it is much faster
and convenient to utilize the 70th Street interchange.
D2. Walmart Market Traffic on Residential Streets
A concern was raised at the February PIM that Walmart Market would increase traffic on
residential streets north of Main Street.
Motorists take the path of least perceived resistance to reach their destinations. As such, traffic
to/from IH-94 will access the Walmart Market site most efficiently from the 70th Street
interchange rather than from the 84th Street interchange/ramp collector system due to fewer stops
and conflicts. Traffic to/from the north and south on 76th Street and 70th Street would access the
site most efficiently from the 76th Street and 70th Street intersections with Main Street rather than
the ramp collector system or neighborhoods for the same reasons. Therefore, it reasonable to
expect that the only Walmart Market traffic anticipated to utilize the residential streets north of
Main Street would be that traffic generated by the residents themselves.
D3. Traffic Signal Wait Times
A concern was raised at the February PIM that it takes multiple cycles to clear the traffic signals
from Main Street to either 70th Street or 76th Street during rush hours, and that Walmart Market
traffic would make wait times considerably longer.
Site observations and the traffic analysis performed at both intersections show that such an
operation does not occur during rush hours. A relatively short surge in traffic due to an office
release or the egress of Dawes heavy vehicles (both located along Main Street) may occur from
time to time during the day and cause a motorist to miss a signal cycle. However, the analysis
shows that these operations are not exacerbated by the Walmart Market site ­ even during its
busiest hours of the day ­ and that outside of these short and few surges the signals operate
acceptably at LOS C or better conditions.
D4. State Fair Park Special Event Traffic
Residents at the February PIM stated they experience heavy traffic due to State Fair Park events
­ most notably during the 11 days of State Fair. Residents stated that traffic utilizing Main Street
is heavy during this time and makes it difficult for them to enter/exit the neighborhood. The
stated concern of residents is that the Walmart Market site will further add to the congestion and
make it more difficult to enter/exit the neighborhood during such an event.
It is important to note that the Wisconsin State Fair is a special 11-day event and that restricting
development to accommodate traffic that occurs for only 3-percent of the year is generally
undesirable. It is also important to note that the Walmart Market contribution of traffic to Main
Street is minimal compared to the volume expected due to State Fair and that the remaining 97-
percent of the year operations are well within acceptable operation levels/available roadway
capacity. That being stated, Main Street is currently utilized as a two-lane undivided street with
wide parking lanes, and the homes within the neighborhood have private garages/parking areas
for personal vehicles. Consideration could be given to restricting parking along Main Street
during the short 11-day event, and adjust traffic signal timings accordingly, to aid in moving
traffic to/from State Fair Park and the neighborhoods. Such an improvement suggestion is not

caused by the Walmart Market, but is suggested by Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc. for the City
of Milwaukee's consideration in easing an existing State Fair traffic condition.
PART E ­ CONCLUSION
All movements at the study area intersections are expected to operate safely and efficiently with
the improvements identified in this TIA.

The Walmart Market - Milwaukee, Wisconsin                                          March 31, 2011

                   CHAPTER II ­ PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
PART A ­ ON-SITE DEVELOPMENT
A1. Development Site Location
A Walmart Market is proposed to be located southwest of the South 70th Street intersection with
West Main Street in the City of Milwaukee. A street map illustrating the location of the
proposed is shown in Exhibit 2-1 at the end of this chapter. A copy of the conceptual site plan is
shown in Exhibit 2-2.
A2. Surrounding Land Use
The proposed development site is an unutilized, deteriorated parking lot bound by Main Street to
the north, 72nd Street to the west, a multi-use trail (former railroad) to the south, and a public
alley to the east. Jetz gas station/convenience store, Air Comfort Systems, Krause Auto Body,
and other small commercial businesses are located between the public alley and the west side of
70th Street. Residential neighborhoods are located along the north side of Main Street, and
Roman Electric is located along the east side of 70th Street.
A3. Conceptual Site Plan & Phasing/Timing
The Walmart Market is to be a 39,994 square foot (sf) grocery store with drive-thru pharmacy.
No developable outlots are proposed. This traffic study assumes the store will be constructed
and operational in Year 2011.
Vehicular access to the Walmart Market site is proposed to be located along Main Street
opposite 71st Street (west access), along 70th Street approximately halfway between Main Street
and Dickinson Street (north access), and along 70th Street opposite Dickinson Street (south
access). An existing north-south alley that intersects Main Street between 71st Street and 70th
Street will remain. Note that the Krause Auto Body building and the two business buildings
south of Jetz gas station/convenience store will be removed to accommodate the access points to
70th Street. Jetz gas station/convenience store and the Air Comfort Systems business will
remain.
Pedestrian connections are planned for the Walmart Market to/from both Main Street and 70th
Street. Bicycle racks are also planned, as is a connection to the multi-use trail to the south.
PART B ­ STUDY AREA
B1. Influence Area
The area of primary influence for Walmart Market includes surrounding neighborhoods in the
City of Milwaukee and the City of West Allis.

Access points to the Walmart Market, described previously, are also referred to as study area
intersections.
PART C ­ OFF-SITE DEVELOPMENT
No planned off-site development was identified. Note that the City of Milwaukee plans to
reconstruct 70th Street and resurface Main Street in Year 2011.
PART D ­ SITE ACCESSIBILITY
D1. Study Area Roadways
The study area roadways are discussed below:
Main Street is an east-west two-lane undivided roadway with parking along both sides of the
street and a posted speed limit of 25 miles per hour (mph) within the study area. According to
the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT), the Year 2009 annual average daily
traffic (AADT) volume on Main Street was approximately 2,600 vehicles per day (vpd) between
70th Street and 71st Street. The City of Milwaukee plans to resurface Main Street in the Year
2011.
76th Street is a north-south four-lane divided roadway with a posted speed limit of 30-mph.
According to WisDOT, the Year 2009 AADT volume on 76th Street just north of Main Street
was approximately 9,800 vpd.
75th Street is a north-south two-lane undivided local roadway with a speed limit of 25-mph that
intersects Main Street as a tee-intersection from the north. This street provides access to the
residential neighborhood north of Main Street. No AADT data is available for this street.
74th Street is a north-south two-lane undivided local roadway with a speed limit of 25-mph that
intersects Main Street as a tee-intersection from the north opposite a private parking lot. This

           CHAPTER III ­ ANALYSIS OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
PART A ­ EXISTING PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Exhibit 3-1 shows the existing transportation detail for the study area intersections. More
specifically, the exhibit illustrates intersection lane configurations, intersection traffic controls,
posted speed limits, and approximate intersection spacing.
PART B ­ EXISTING/BACKGROUND TRAFFIC VOLUMES
Weekday evening and Saturday midday peak hour turning movement counts were conducted
prior to conducting any traffic analysis. The following table summarizes the date each count was
conducted.
            Intersection:                                   Weekday PM       Saturday MID

                      Main Street & 70th Street              1/13/2011         1/15/2011
                   70th Street & Dickinson Street            1/13/2011         1/15/2011

The weekday evening and Saturday midday peak hours were determined to be 4:30 to 5:30pm
and 11:15am to 12:15pm. Copies of the existing traffic counts and related calculations are
included in Appendix A.
The development is planned to be built in the Year 2011. Therefore, no growth rate was applied
to the existing traffic volumes. However, since the counts were conducted in January of 2011,
the counts were seasonally adjusted then balanced using WisDOT seasonal factors for urban
collectors. The seasonal growth rate increased the January of 2011 volumes by a factor of 1.087,
or an 8.7-percent increase. The seasonally adjusted volumes have been labeled Year 2011
background traffic volumes and are shown in Exhibit 3-2.
PART C ­ BACKGROUND TRAFFIC LEVEL OF SERVICE
C1. Level of Service Definitions
The study area intersections were analyzed based on the procedures set forth in the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). Intersection operation is defined by "level of service".
Level of service (LOS) is a quantitative measure that refers to the overall quality of flow at an
intersection ranging from very good, represented by LOS `A', to very poor, represented by LOS
`F'. For the purpose of this study, LOS D was used to define acceptable peak hour operating
conditions. Descriptions of the various levels of service are as follows:
        LOS A is the highest level of service that can be achieved. Under this condition,
        intersection approaches appear quite open, turning movements are easily made, and
        nearly all drivers find freedom of operation. At signalized and unsignalized intersections,
        average delays are less than 10 seconds.
        LOS B represents stable operation. At signalized intersections, average vehicle delays
        are 10 to 20 seconds. At unsignalized intersections, average delays are 10 to 15 seconds.

       LOS C still represents stable operation, but periodic backups of a few vehicles may
       develop behind turning vehicles. Most drivers begin to feel restricted, but not
       objectionably so. At signalized intersections, average vehicle delays are 20 to 35
       seconds. At unsignalized intersections, average delays are 15 to 25 seconds.
       LOS D represents increasing traffic restrictions as the intersection approaches instability.
       Delays to approaching vehicles may be substantial during short peaks within the peak
       period, but periodic clearance of long lines occurs, thus preventing excessive backups.
       At signalized intersections, average vehicle delays are 35 to 55 seconds. At unsignalized
       intersections, average delays are 25 to 35 seconds.
       LOS E represents the capacity of the intersection. At signalized intersections, average
       vehicle delays are 55 to 80 seconds. At unsignalized intersections, average delays are 35
       to 50 seconds.
       LOS F represents jammed conditions where the intersection is over capacity and
       acceptable gaps for unsignalized intersections in the mainline traffic flow are minimal.
       At signalized intersections, average vehicle delays exceed 80 seconds. At unsignalized
       intersections, average delays exceed 50 seconds.
C2. Year 2011 Background Traffic Operations ­ With Improvements
Exhibit 3-3 shows the Year 2011 background traffic (no development) peak hour operating
conditions at the study area intersections. The Year 2011 background traffic analysis was
conducted using the existing lane configurations shown in Exhibit 3-1, the Year 2011
background traffic volumes shown in Exhibit 3-2, and the existing traffic signal timings obtained
from the City of Milwaukee and included in Appendix A.
As shown in Exhibit 3-3, traffic signalized intersections currently operate acceptably at LOS C
or better conditions. Stop-sign controlled intersections along Main Street operate acceptably at
LOS B or better conditions. The westbound approach of Dickinson Street operates at LOS E
conditions for 10 vehicles in the weekday evening peak hour. Since the approach services a low
volume of traffic, operates well outside the weekday evening peak hour, has a volume-to-
capacity (v/c) ratio of 0.12 (desirably less than 1.00), and alternative access exists via the Main
Street intersection with 70th Street, this LOS E condition does not warrant correction.

The Walmart Market - Milwaukee, Wisconsin                                           March 31, 2011

                    CHAPTER IV ­ DEVELOPMENT TRAFFIC
PART A ­ DEVELOPMENT TRAFFIC FORECASTING
To address future traffic impacts along study area roadways and at the intersections adjacent to
the development, it is necessary to identify the hourly and daily volume of traffic generated by
the development. The expected traffic volumes generated by the Walmart Market development
are based on the type and size of the proposed land use, and on trip rates as published in the
Institute of Transportation Engineer's (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition, 2008.
A1. Trip Generation & Distribution
The trip generation and distribution for the Walmart Market is shown in Exhibit 4-1. The trip
distribution was based on the location of surrounding populated areas and on the existing AADT
traffic patterns of the surrounding roadways.
As shown in Exhibit 4-1, the proposed Walmart Market is expected to generate approximately
125 new trips to/from the study area during a typical weekday morning peak hour (80 in/45 out),
340 new trips to/from the study area during a typical weekday evening peak hour (175 in/165 out)
and 350 new trips to/from the study area during a typical Saturday midday peak hour (180 in/170
out). On a typical weekday (24 hour period), the Walmart Market is expected to generate
approximately 3,270 new trips (1,635 in/1,635 out).
A2. Mode Split
Though accessible to pedestrian, bicycle, and transit users, the primary mode to/from the
Walmart Market development is expected to be personal motorized vehicle. Therefore, no trip
reductions were taken for other modes. As such, the analysis assumes a more conservative and
higher vehicle volume scenario.
A3. Determination of Linked and Pass-by Trip Traffic
Linked trips occur when a patron or employee visits more than one land use within a site without
leaving the site. Since no other users are planned for the Walmart Market site, linked trips will
not occur.
Pass-by trips occur when motorists on the adjacent roadway system stop off at a development
prior to continuing on their intended route. For example, a motorist southbound on 70th Street
stops at the Walmart Market prior to continuing southbound on 70th Street. Approximately 15-
percent of the total driveway trips for the development are expected to be a result of pass-by
trips. Per the ITE Trip Generation Manual, this percentage is well within the pass-by rate ranges
seen at other grocery stores in the United States. Further, the resulting pass-by trip figures were
not allowed to exceed 10-percent of the existing traffic along 70th Street per guidance in the ITE
Trip Generation Manual. The Walmart Market pass-by trips are shown in Exhibit 4-2.
A4. Trip Assignment
New trips (i.e. total trips minus linked trips minus pass-by trips) expected to be generated by
Walmart Market were assigned based on the trip distribution shown in Exhibit 4-1. The Walmart
Market new trips are shown in Exhibit 4-3.
The Walmart Market pass-by trips (Exhibit 4-2) were added to the Walmart Market new trips
(Exhibit 4-3) to determine the Walmart Market driveway trips shown in Exhibit 4-4.
PART B ­ DETERMINATION OF TOTAL TRAFFIC
Year 2011 total traffic volumes, shown in Exhibit 4-5, were determined by adding the Year 2011
background traffic volumes (Exhibit 3-2) to the Walmart Market driveway trips (Exhibit 4-4).

       CHAPTER V ­ ANALYSIS OF TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
PART A ­ TOTAL TRAFFIC CAPACITY LEVEL OF SERVICE
A1. Year 2011 Total Traffic Operating Conditions ­ Without Improvements
Exhibit 5-1 shows the Year 2011 total traffic (with Walmart Market) peak hour operating
conditions at the study area intersections without improvements. The Year 2011 total traffic
analysis was conducted using the existing lane configurations shown in Exhibit 3-1, the Year
2011 total traffic volumes shown in Exhibit 4-5, and the existing traffic signal timings obtained
from the City of Milwaukee and included in Appendix A.
As shown in Exhibit 5-1, the traffic-signalized intersections of Main Street with 76th Street and
70th Street are expected to continue to operate acceptably at LOS C or better conditions. Stop-
sign controlled intersections along Main Street are expected to continue to operate acceptably at
LOS B or better conditions. These operations make sense, as 1) Main Street currently services
low volumes of traffic to/from the neighborhoods to the north and 2) the Walmart Market site
adds a relatively low incremental increase in traffic to Main Street. Traffic exiting the north
access along 70th Street is expected to operate acceptably at LOS D or better conditions, and
traffic exiting the south access along 70th Street is expected to operate acceptably at LOS B or
better conditions.
The westbound approach of Dickinson Street is expected to operate at LOS F conditions for 10
vehicles in the weekday evening peak hour. Since the approach services a low volume of traffic,
operates well outside the weekday evening peak hour, has a volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio of
0.15 (desirably less than 1.00), and alternative access exists via the Main Street intersection with
70th Street, this LOS F condition does not warrant correction. Note that the existing volume at
the intersection is the same and operates at LOS E with a v/c ratio of 0.12.
PART B ­ QUEUEING ANALYSIS
To estimate storage length requirements for turn bays at the study area intersections, a queuing
analysis has been conducted. Note that the 50th percentile and 95th percentile probable queue
lengths were checked against available turn bay lengths and intersection spacing to see if
improvements are necessary. The following is a list of where the results of the queuing analysis
can be found.

PART C ­ INTERSECTION SIGHT DISTANCE
Note that the intersection sight distance (ISD) measurements and photographs are based on
approximate intersection placement and on in-field observation by Traffic Analysis & Design,
Inc. The party responsible for designing the intersections is responsible for cross-checking,
verifying and designing for all applicable sight distances.
All new or improved intersections throughout the study area should be designed for ISD in
accordance with the latest edition of the American Association of State Highway Transportation
Officials (AASHTO) A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. ISD has been
checked at the following locations:

           Main Street & Proposed West Access
           70th Street & Proposed North Access
           70th Street & Proposed South Access opposite Dickinson Street
C1. Main Street & Proposed West Access ISD
ISD for the Main Street intersection with the proposed Walmart Market west access, which is
proposed to be constructed opposite 71st Street, was conducted using the following parameters:
           A design speed of 5 mph above the posted speed limit, or 30 mph.
           A passenger vehicle (P-vehicle) eye height of 3.5 feet and a single-unit trunk (SU-
           vehicle) eye height of 7.6 feet, located 14.6-feet south of the Main Street curb line.
           The height of the object to be seen on Main Street of 3.5-feet.
ISD from the proposed west access controls the necessary measurements, as the distances are
greater than the distances needed for a vehicle on Main Street making a westbound left-turn onto
the west access. All calculations are provided in Appendix A. As shown in Exhibit 5-4, ISD is
expected to be met in both directions of Main Street at the proposed west access.
C2. 70th Street & Proposed North Access ISD
ISD for the 70th Street intersection with the proposed Walmart Market north access, which is
proposed to be constructed approximately halfway between Main Street and Dickinson Street,
was conducted using the following parameters:
           A design speed of 5 mph above the posted speed limit, or 35 mph.
           A passenger vehicle (P-vehicle) eye height of 3.5 feet and a single-unit trunk (SU-
           vehicle) eye height of 7.6 feet, located 14.6-feet west of the 70th Street curb line. The
           curb-to-vehicle distance was maximized since a building currently exists, but will be
           taken as part of the development, within the 14.6-feet distance.
           The height of the object to be seen on 70th Street of 3.5-feet.
ISD from the proposed north access controls the necessary measurements, as the distances are
greater than the distances needed for a vehicle on 70th Street making a northbound left-turn onto
the north access. All calculations are provided in Appendix A. As shown in Exhibit 5-5, ISD is
expected to be met in both directions of 70th Street at the proposed north access.
C3. 70th Street & Proposed South Access ISD
ISD for the 70th Street intersection with the proposed Walmart Market south access, which is
proposed to be constructed opposite Dickinson Street, was conducted using the following
parameters:
           A design speed of 5 mph above the posted speed limit, or 35 mph.
           A passenger vehicle (P-vehicle) eye height of 3.5 feet and a semi-trunk (WB-vehicle)
           eye height of 7.6 feet, located 14.6-feet west of the 70th Street curb line.
           The height of the object to be seen on 70th Street of 3.5-feet.
ISD from the proposed south access controls the necessary measurements, as the distances are
greater than the distances needed for a vehicle on 70th Street making a northbound left-turn onto
the north access. All calculations are provided in Appendix A.
As shown in Exhibit 5-6, ISD is expected to be met for both P-vehicle and WB-vehicle motorists
looking north at southbound oncoming traffic. ISD is expected to be met for the WB-vehicle

motorists, but not the P-vehicle motorists, looking south at northbound oncoming traffic. Note
that, if a P-vehicle motorist is able to position themselves approximately 10-feet west of the curb
line rather than the 14.6-feet used for design in the AASHTO GDHS (which most P-vehicles can
do) the ISD would be met. Improvements to address the ISD deficiency are discussed in the
Chapter I and Chapter IV recommendations.

        CHAPTER VI ­ RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION
PART A ­ RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS
A1. Level of Service Definition
The study area intersections were analyzed based on the procedures set forth in the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). This manual is accepted in Wisconsin and the rest of the
country as the industry standard in estimating operations at both signalized and unsignalized
intersections.
Intersection operation is defined by "level of service" (LOS), a quantitative measure that refers
to the overall quality of flow at an intersection ranging from very good, represented by LOS `A',
to very poor, represented by LOS `F'. LOS D or better operations (fewer than 35-seconds of
average vehicle delay at stop sign controlled intersections, fewer than 55-seconds of average
vehicle delay at traffic signal controlled intersections) are defined as acceptable peak hour
operating conditions.
A2. Year 2011 Background Traffic Recommended Improvements
The Year 2011 background traffic analysis assumes the Walmart Market does not occur. The
analysis was conducted using existing intersection geometrics, traffic controls and signal
timings. Based on the capacity analysis, no improvements are necessary to accommodate
operations under background traffic volumes. Traffic signalized intersections operate acceptably
at LOS C or better conditions. Stop-sign controlled intersections along Main Street operate
acceptably at LOS B or better conditions.
Note that the City of Milwaukee should consider replacing the bridge rail along the east side of
70th Street, south of Dickinson Street, with a more see-through solution to improve sight-distance
for motorists currently turning from Dickinson Street onto 70th Street. This improvement, which
is not related to the Walmart Market in any way, would address an existing sight distance
concern for the neighborhood east of 70th Street.
A3. Year 2011 Total Traffic Recommended Improvements
Year 2011 total traffic volumes assume the full build-out of the Walmart Market. The following
improvements, shown in Exhibit 1-3 at the end of Chapter I, are recommended to accommodate
the Year 2011 total traffic.
       Main Street & 76th Street
               No improvements are anticipated to be necessary.
       Main Street & 75th Street
               No improvements are anticipated to be necessary.
       Main Street & 74th Street
               No improvements are anticipated to be necessary.
       Main Street & 73rd Street
               No improvements are anticipated to be necessary.
       Main Street & 72nd Street
               No improvements are anticipated to be necessary.

       Main Street & 71st Street/Proposed West Access
               Construct the Walmart Market west access on the south side of Main Street
               opposite 71st Street. No exclusive turn lanes are necessary.
               Install a stop sign to control the Walmart Market northbound approach. Note that
               "DO NOT ENTER" signs currently exist along the north side of Main Street to
               inform motorists exiting the site that 71st Street is one-way southbound only.
       Main Street & Public Alley
               Install a stop sign to control the public alley northbound approach.
       Main Street & 70th Street
               No improvements are anticipated to be necessary.
          th
       70 Street & Proposed North Access
               Construct the Walmart Market north access on the west side of 70th Street
               approximately half-way between Main Street and Dickinson Street. No exclusive
               turn lanes are necessary.
               Install a stop sign to control the Walmart Market eastbound approach.
       70th Street & Proposed South Access
               Construct the Walmart Market south access on the west side of 70th Street
               opposite Dickinson Street. No exclusive turn lanes are necessary.
               Install a stop sign to control the Walmart Market eastbound approach. Note that
               poor sight-distance exists at the access looking south for passenger vehicles, but
               not for delivery trucks, due to the height of the existing bridge abutment/railing on
               the west side of 70th Street. Install a MUTCD-compliant "RIGHT-TURN
               ONLY" sign with an additional sign stating "EXCEPT DELIVERY TRUCKS" to
               improve the safety of the intersection.
       General Improvements
               Recall that the Jetz gas station/convenience store and Air Comfort Systems
               business are expected to remain when the Walmart Market access points to 70th
               Street are constructed. Both businesses, as well as the Roman Electric business
               on the east side of 70th Street, have off-site parking accommodations.
               Consideration may be given to removing parking on the west side of 70th Street to
               improve visibility for motorists exiting the Walmart Market, Jetz, and HVAC
               sites. Consideration may also be given to removing parking on the south side of
               Main Street along the Walmart Market property to improve visibility for motorists
               exiting the west access and the existing public alley.
The traffic-signalized intersections are expected to continue to operate acceptably at LOS C or
better conditions. Stop-sign controlled intersections along Main Street are expected to continue
to operate acceptably at LOS B or better conditions. These operations make sense, as 1) Main
Street currently services low volumes of traffic to/from the neighborhoods to the north and 2) the
Walmart Market site adds a relatively low incremental increase in traffic to Main Street. Traffic
exiting the north access along 70th Street is expected to operate acceptably at LOS D or better
conditions, and traffic exiting the south access along 70th Street is expected to operate acceptably
at LOS B or better conditions.

Walmart Market, and representatives of the City of Milwaukee were present to take note of the
concerns of the surrounding residents. This section of the report is provided to address traffic-
related concerns raised at the meeting that relate to the Walmart Market.
B1. Truck Traffic on Main Street
Residents at the February PIM stated they had concerns with Walmart delivery truck traffic
along Main Street, as well as truck headlights directed northbound into homes. Note that the
conceptual site plan at the time included a truck access along Main Street between 71st Street and
72nd Street, as well as loading docks along the west side of the building with trucks positioned
facing north towards Main Street.
To address this concern, the latest Walmart Market site plan has been reconfigured in a manner
that will only accommodate delivery trucks along 70th Street. More specifically, the loading
docks have been placed along the south side of the proposed building with trucks positioned
facing south, the truck access along Main Street between 71st Street and 72nd Street has been
removed, and the internal site layout is such that delivery trucks will not be able to physically
make turns within the site to reach Main Street. With the IH-94 interchange with 70th Street to
the north, truck drivers will not use Main Street to reach their destinations since it is much faster
and convenient to utilize the 70th Street interchange.
B2. Walmart Market Traffic on Residential Streets
A concern was raised at the February PIM that Walmart Market would increase traffic on
residential streets north of Main Street.
Motorists take the path of least perceived resistance to reach their destinations. As such, traffic
to/from IH-94 will access the Walmart Market site most efficiently from the 70th Street
interchange rather than from the 84th Street interchange/ramp collector system due to fewer stops
and conflicts. Traffic to/from the north and south on 76th Street and 70th Street would access the
site most efficiently from the 76th Street and 70th Street intersections with Main Street rather than
the ramp collector system or neighborhoods for the same reasons. Therefore, it reasonable to
expect that the only Walmart Market traffic anticipated to utilize the residential streets north of
Main Street would be that traffic generated by the residents themselves.
B3. Traffic Signal Wait Times
A concern was raised at the February PIM that it takes multiple cycles to clear the traffic signals
from Main Street to either 70th Street or 76th Street during rush hours, and that Walmart Market
traffic would make wait times considerably longer.
Site observations and the traffic analysis performed at both intersections show that such an
operation does not occur during rush hours. A relatively short surge in traffic due to an office
release or the egress of Dawes heavy vehicles (both located along Main Street) may occur from
time to time during the day and cause a motorist to miss a signal cycle. However, the analysis
shows that these operations are not exacerbated by the Walmart Market site ­ even during its
busiest hours of the day ­ and that outside of these short and few surges the signals operate
acceptably at LOS C or better conditions.
B4. State Fair Park Special Event Traffic
Residents at the February PIM stated they experience heavy traffic due to State Fair Park events
­ most notably during the 11 days of State Fair. Residents stated that traffic utilizing Main Street

is heavy during this time and makes it difficult for them to enter/exit the neighborhood. The
stated concern of residents is that the Walmart Market site will further add to the congestion and
make it more difficult to enter/exit the neighborhood during such an event.
It is important to note that the Wisconsin State Fair is a special 11-day event and that restricting
development to accommodate traffic that occurs for only 3-percent of the year is generally
undesirable. It is also important to note that the Walmart Market contribution of traffic to Main
Street is minimal compared to the volume expected due to State Fair and that the remaining 97-
percent of the year operations are well within acceptable operation levels/available roadway
capacity. That being stated, Main Street is currently utilized as a two-lane undivided street with
wide parking lanes, and the homes within the neighborhood have private garages/parking areas
for personal vehicles. Consideration could be given to restricting parking along Main Street
during the short 11-day event, and adjust traffic signal timings accordingly, to aid in moving
traffic to/from State Fair Park and the neighborhoods. Such an improvement suggestion is not
caused by the Walmart Market, but is suggested by Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc. for the City
of Milwaukee's consideration in easing an existing State Fair traffic condition.
PART C ­ CONCLUSION
All movements at the study area intersections are expected to operate safely and efficiently with
the improvements identified in this TIA.

                HOLLYWOOD CASINO & HOTEL SPRINGFIELD

ACCESS ROADWAYS

The Hollywood Casino & Hotel Springfield is proposed along the west side of Main
Street bounded by Main Street to the east, Emery Street to the north and Columbus
Avenue to the west. Regional approach routes to the site include I-90, I-91 and I-291.
The local roadways within the City of Springfield that guests will use when traveling
between the site and the interstate highways are Dwight Street, Chestnut Street, Bond
Street, Main Street, Emery Street and Columbus Avenue.

I-91

I-91 is a north-south interstate highway beginning in New Haven, CT to the south
continuing north through the entire lengths of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont
ending at the Vermont/Canada border. I-91 provides access to Hartford, CT and
Waterbury, CT to the south and Northampton, MA, Greenfield, MA, and Brattleboro, VT
to the north.

Approximately 4 miles north of the site is the interchange with I-90 (Massachusetts
Turnpike) which will serve as the approach route for access from Pittsfield, MA and
Albany, NY to the west. The local roadways that patrons will use approaching the site
from the north and west will be Dwight Street, Congress Street, Main Street and Emery
Street. Patrons leaving the site will return to I-91 NB via Columbus Avenue.

Patrons approaching the site via I-91 from the south will primarily use the exit ramp to
Dwight Street then use Congress Street, Main Street and Emery Street to approach the
site. Some of the patrons will also use Columbus Avenue as an approach route to the site.
Leaving the site the majority of the patrons will use Main Street to Bond Street to access
the I-91 SB entrance ramp. A small percentage of patrons will also use West Columbus
Avenue southbound to access I-91.

I-291

The I-291 corridor provides direct access to and between I-90, to the east of the site and
I-91 to the south. The I-91/I-291 interchange is immediately north of the site. I-291
passes through the northwestern quadrant of the City of Springfield and is served by six
interchanges. The patrons approaching the site via I-90 from points east such as
Worcester, MA and Boston, MA will use I-291 to access the site. Patrons approaching
the site using I-291 will exit to Dwight Street and then use Congress Street, Main Street
and Emery Street. Patrons leaving the site will return to I-291 via Main Street to
Congress Street and use the I-291 EB Entrance Ramp from Chestnut Street.




                                            1
Main Street

Main Street travels in the north-south direction beginning in Springfield's South End
neighborhood traveling north through the Downtown Area and then continues north past
the site through the northwest portion of Springfield and then continues into Chicopee as
Center Street. Along the proposed Hollywood Casino & Hotel Springfield frontage,
Main Street has two travel lanes in each direction with left turn lanes provided in both
directions at Liberty Street and Congress Street. A landscaped median is provided
between the northbound and southbound lanes of Main Street along the entire site
frontage. To the south of the site, the development along Main Street is a mix of
commercial, retail and restaurants. In the vicinity of the site the development along Main
Street across from the project site is commercial.

Dwight Street

Dwight Street travels in the north-south direction beginning in the south at State Street in
downtown Springfield traveling north through the central and northern parts of the city
ending at Dover Street in the vicinity of the Baystate Medical Center. South of Liberty
Street, Dwight Street is one-way southbound. North of Liberty Street, it is a two-way
street. In the vicinity of the site, Dwight Street is general parallel to Main Street and has
two lanes in each direction with an additional lane for northbound left turning vehicles
onto Congress Street. In the vicinity of the project site the development along Dwight
Street is commercial.

Chestnut Street

Chestnut Street travels in the north-south direction beginning to the south at State Street
in downtown Springfield traveling north through the central and northern parts of the city
ending at Noble Street in the vicinity of the Baystate Medical Center. South of Liberty
Street, Chestnut Street is one-way northbound. North of Liberty Street, it is a two-way
street. In the vicinity of the site, Chestnut Street is general parallel to Main Street and has
two lanes in each direction with a median divider. An additional lane has been provided
for northbound left turning vehicles onto Congress Street. In the vicinity of the project
site the development along Chestnut Street is commercial.

Congress Street

Congress Street is a two lane roadway traveling in the east-west direction between Main
Street and Chestnut Street. Congress Street is approximately 40 feet wide with on-street
parking permitted along the south side of the street. The development along Congress
Street is commercial.

(East and West) Columbus Avenue

Columbus Avenue travels parallel to I-91 beginning at Main Street in the south end of the
City continuing north past the project site ending at the I-291/Route 20 ramps




                                              2
immediately north of the site. West Columbus Avenue is one-way southbound and East
Columbus Avenue is one-way northbound. For most of their length West Columbus
Avenue travels along the west side of I-91 and East Columbus Avenue travels along the
east side of I-91 with both acting as service roads for the interstate highway ramps.

Emery Street

Emery Street borders the project site on the north and is a two lane roadway traveling in
the east-west direction between Columbus Avenue and Main Street. At its intersection
with East Columbus Avenue all traffic must turn right and head north. At Main Street all
traffic on emery Street must turn right and head south. There is no median break along
Main Street at Emery Street thus there is no access to Emery Street from northbound
Main Street.

INTERSECTIONS STUDIED

Traffic counts were conducted at fifteen of the intersections in the immediate vicinity of
the site. The intersections studied are listed below:

       Columbus Street at Emery Street
       Columbus at Liberty Street
       Main Street at Bond Street
       Main Street at Boylston Street
       Main Street at Emery Street
       Main Street at Congress Street
       Main Street at Liberty Street
       Bond Street at I-91 SB On Ramp
       Dwight Street at Bond Street
       Dwight Street at I-291 WB Ramps
       Dwight Street at I-91 NB Exit / I-291 EB Entrance
       Dwight Street at Congress Street
       Dwight Street at Liberty Street
       Chestnut Street at I-91 SB Exit / I-291 EB Entrance
       Chestnut Street at Congress Street

The traffic counts for these intersections and the Volumes Traffic Flow Diagram TFD-1
for the existing volumes are presented in the Supplemental Traffic Data.


IMPACT EVALUATION


Determining the traffic impact of the proposed casino has been analyzed by calculating
the number of trips that are expected to be generated by the development and
subsequently assigning the trips to the surrounding roadway system in order to determine
the impact of the proposed development. It is assumed that the peak impact traffic of the




                                            3
proposed Hollywood Casino & Hotel Springfield will occur during an afternoon rush
hour, when the adjacent roadway traffic is also at its peak. The Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 8th Edition, 2008 contains afternoon peak hour trip
generation rates for "Casino/Video Lottery Establishment" (Land Use 473). However, the
data is based on only a single study and is therefore not considered reliable. Also, there
is no information available as to what a casino generated over an average day. To
determine an estimate for the anticipated trip generation of the proposed Hollywood
Casino & Hotel Springfield, during an Afternoon Peak Period, we used trip generation
rates developed by E.P. Ferris & Assoc., as presented in the Traffic Impact Study -
Hollywood Casino; Columbus, OH (208.1), the trip generation rate is 0.46 trips per
gaming seat. These rates are based on the number of "gaming positions" or seats (e.g., 1
seat per slot / 8 seats per gaming table). The use of gaming seat as the method for
calculating the anticipated trip generation for a casino without consideration of other uses
on the site is a standard methodology. This is noted on page 6 in the E.P. Ferris study:

       "Most casino traffic studies use gaming position as an independent variable.
       Gaming position is defined as one seat, so one slot machine would be one gaming
       position and one seat at a poker table would be one gaming position. Facilities
       attached to the casino, such as hotel and food and beverage outlets, exist to
       support gambling operations and are included in the gaming position trip
       generation rate."

The number of anticipated gaming seats for the proposed Springfield Hollywood Casino
is calculated as follows:

                                  Seats
       2,850 Slots                2,850
       80 Tables 8/Table            640
       20 Poker @ 6/Table           120

       Total Gaming Seats         3,610


Trip generation numbers were calculated for the PM Peak Period at the full build of 3,610
gaming seats using the generation rate of 0.46 trips/seat as follows:

       PM Peak Hour               1,769
       Entering 53%                 938
       Exiting - 47%                831




                                             4
The trip distribution for guests visiting the resort was calculated based the Casino Resort
Market Assessment study prepared by Strategic Market Advisors for the Hollywood
Casino & Hotel Springfield. This study calculated the number of patrons visiting the
resort annually from the following 17 geographical areas:

       Hollywood Primary
       Central CT
       North Secondary
       South Central Mass
       Northwest CT
       Coastal CT
       Tertiary Southwest
       Tertiary West
       Saratoga
       Tertiary North
       Southern NH
       North Central Mass
       North Shore
       Inside 128
       South Shore
       Rhode Island
       Southwest CT

In order to distribute the traffic to the four regional approach routes, the percentage of
total guests visiting the casino was assigned to each geographical area. Then the
percentages were then assigned to each regional approach route. Using the anticipated
number of patrons from each geographic area and assigning each area an approach route
the anticipated regional approach traffic distribution was created. The spreadsheet with
these calculations is presented in the Supplemental Traffic Data. The Regional Trip
Distribution is graphically shown in the Traffic Flow Diagram TFD-2 presented in the
Supplemental Traffic Data and presented in tabular form below:

       I-90 / I-91 Points West and North               35%
       I-90 / I-291Points East                         15%
       I-91 Points South                               40%
       Local                                           10%
                                                      100%

The impact of the proposed development to the affected roadway network in the vicinity
of the site is determined by assigning the generated traffic volumes for the Hollywood
Casino & Hotel Springfield to each roadway and intersection studied based on the
calculated trip distribution. The anticipated Afternoon Peak Trip Generation numbers are
shown in the Traffic Flow Diagram TFD-3 presented in the Supplemental Traffic Data.




                                            5
It assumed that all buses including local and regional bus service will stop at Union
Station. Patrons will then be able to walk via surface sidewalks or the pedestrian sky
bridge over Main Street between Union Station and Hollywood Casino & Hotel
Springfield.

Valet parking drop off / pick up will be located in the porte-cochere along Main Street at
the front of the casino. Access to the porte-cochere will be from the garage entrance
along Main Street opposite Congress Street. Vehicles exiting the porte-cochere area will
be able to turn right on to Main Street southbound or continue to the west and exit from
the site onto Columbus Avenue. It is anticipated at all taxi service will use the porte-
cochere to drop off and pick up passengers.

The construction of the Hollywood Casino & Hotel Springfield will necessitate the
closure of a part of two city streets. The roadway sections to be closed are Liberty Street
between East Columbus Avenue and Main Street and Boylston Street between Liberty
Street and Emery Street. Currently these streets only serve the Peter-Pan bus depot and
The Republican Newspaper operations. Due to the closure of these streets, the traffic
currently using them must be reassigned to the surrounding street. Traffic Flow Diagram
TFD-5 showing the diverted traffic is presented in the Supplemental Traffic Data at the
end of this section.

TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

2018 No-Build Volumes were then calculated by expanding the Existing Traffic Volumes
by 0.5% per year to 2018 to account for general background growth of traffic on the
roadway network. The 2018 No-Build Volumes are shown in Traffic Flow Diagram
TFD-4. These volumes were then adjusted to represent the roadway network with the
proposed road closures, by applying the Diverted Trips to the 2018 No-Build volumes to
create the 2018 No-Build w/Diverted Trips shown in Traffic Flow Diagram TFD-6
presented in the supplemental Traffic Data.

The 2018 Build Volumes were then calculated by adding the Site Generated Traffic to the
2018 No-Build w/ Diverted Trips volumes. The 2018 Build volumes are shown in
Traffic Flow DiagramTFD-7 presented in the Supplemental Traffic Data.

RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS

Evaluation of the 2018 Build Volumes by intersection capacity analysis reveals that
improvements are needed at a number of the intersections studied and along various
roadways, to allow for traffic to flow at a Level of Service (LOS) C or better during the
afternoon peak period once the Hollywood Casino & Hotel Springfield is opened. The
recommended improvements are as follows:

Chestnut Street at Congress Street
      Install a traffic control signal.




                                            6
Dwight Street at Bond Street
      Provide a break in the Dwight Street median to allow for through vehicles
      traveling east along Bond Street to continue through the intersection.
      Install a traffic control signal.

Dwight Street at I-91 NB Exit Ramp
      Widen the exit ramp to provide two lanes - an exclusive left turn lane and an
      exclusive right turn lane.
      Install a traffic control signal.

Congress Street between Main Street and Dwight Street
      Eliminate on street parking to permit three travel lanes along Congress Street.
      The Congress Street approach to Main Street will have an exclusive right turn
      lane and a shared through / left turn lane.
      The Congress street approach to Dwight Street will have a shared through / right
      turn lane and an exclusive left turn lane.

Dwight Street at Congress Street
      Revise the pavement markings on the eastbound Congress Street approach to
      provide two lanes - a shared through / right turn lane and an exclusive left turn
      lane.
      Revise the lane use along southbound Dwight Street to provide for three lanes -
      an exclusive right turn lane, an exclusive through lane and an exclusive left turn
      lane. This will necessitate the removal of the median on this leg of Dwight Street.
      Replace the traffic control signal.

Main Street at Emery Street
      Provide a break in the Main Street median to allow for full access to Main Street
      from Emery Street.
      Widen the Main Street northbound approach to provide three lanes - a through
      lane and two exclusive left turn lanes onto Emery Street.
      Widen the eastbound Emery Street approach to provide two lanes - an exclusive
      right turn lane and an exclusive left turn lane.
      Install a traffic control signal.

Main Street at Congress Street / Casino Valet /Garage Entrance
      Revise the lane use along westbound Congress Street to provide two lanes - an
      exclusive right turn lane and a shared through / left turn lane.
      Install a traffic control signal.

Main Street at Liberty Street
      Replace the traffic control signal.




                                            7
Emery Street at Hollywood Casino Garage Main Drive
     Widen Emery Street westbound to provide two lanes - a shared through / left turn
     lane and an exclusive left turn lane.
     Install a traffic control signal.

Emery Street at Columbus Avenue
     Widen the median break between East Columbus Avenue and West Columbus
     Avenue to allow for two way traffic.
     Install a traffic control signal.

Coordinated Signal System
      Provide an on-street master system to provide tight coordinated operation at the
      following signalized intersections:
             Main Street at Emery Street
             Main Street at Congress Street
             Main Street at Liberty Street
             Dwight Street at Bond Street
             Dwight Street at I-291 WB Ramps
             Dwight Street at I-91 NB Exit
             Dwight Street at Congress Street
             Dwight Street at Liberty Street
             Chestnut Street at Congress Street
             Emery Street at Hollywood Casino Garage Main Drive


CAPACITY ANALYSIS

The anticipated levels of service for each of the intersections studied with the 2018 No-
Build Traffic Volumes with existing conditions and the 2018 Build volumes and the
recommended improvements implemented are as follows:

This table shows that all of the intersections in the vicinity of the site will operate at a
Level of Service (LOS) C or better with the 2018 No-Build conditions and will continue
to operate at an LOS C or better when the Hollywood Casino & Hotel Springfield is
opened. In fact, the majority of the intersections will operate an LOS A or B meaning,
motorists will be able to easily and safely traverse these intersections. The capacity
analyses for both the 2018 No-Build and 2018 Build conditions are presented in the
Supplemental Traffic Data.

RIGHT OF WAY

Based on available information there appears to be sufficient ROW available to construct
the proposed improvements on City land or land controlled by the developers of the
Hollywood Casino & Hotel Springfield.

PEDESTRIAN ACCESS

Pedestrian access to the Hollywood Casino & Hotel Springfield will be provided via
three major points. The street level entrance will be located along Main Street at the
porte-cochere. In addition to the normal street level entrance, two pedestrian sky bridges
are proposed. The first will be over Main Street to the east between the casino and Union
Station. The second will be to the south over the railroad tracks, providing access
between the casino and the renovated Paramount Theatre.

In addition to these elevated pedestrian walkways, each of the signalized intersections
listed above to be included in the coordinated signal system will be provided with
pedestrian crosswalks across each leg of the intersection and fully accessible pedestrian
signals. The accessible signals will be in full compliance with the 2010 MUTCD and the
latest Massachusetts AAB guidelines.

In addition to the construction of the Hollywood Casino & Hotel Springfield, Union
Station will also be undergoing a major renovation during the next 5 years. This
renovation of Union Station is being undertaken by the City of Springfield will create a
modern multi-modal facility incorporating local bus access, regional bus access and rail
access. The developers of the Hollywood Casino & Hotel Springfield embrace the use of
multi-modal access to their facility. Not only are they providing an elevated pedestrian
bridge between Union Station and the new casino, they intend to encourage its use by
their employees and guests through creative marketing and outreach programs.

Additionally, in cooperation with Peter Pan, Hollywood Casino & Hotel Springfield
envisions packaging one-day and multi-day independent charter tours, bringing people
directly to Springfield and Hollywood casino for day trips and "play and stay" or "play,
stay and shop'' packages. Overnight packages would not be limited to the Hollywood
hotel but would offer stays at other Springfield hotels at various different price points to
suit the needs attract a wide variety customers.

Traffic Engineering Terms
(this page intentionally blank)
Throughout this report, many terms unique to traffic engineering are used. Below are
definitions of many of these terms.

Trip is a one-way movement to or from a site. One car entering and leaving site
constitutes two trips.

Traffic Generation is the actual number of vehicle movements which may reasonably be
expected to be attracted by a specific development. Usually traffic generation is
expressed as a number of trips.

Peak Hourly Generation is traffic generation which may be anticipated during the
highest volume hour for the particular development. This analysis parameter may vary as
to the time of day, depending on the type of facility being proposed.

Capacity and Level of Service are terms utilized to describe the ability of a roadway to
handle its traffic assignment.

Level of Service is a measure of the quality of flow and overall congestion on a
particular section of road or at a specific intersection.

Levels of Service (LOS) are defined in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 of the
Transportation Research Board, National Research Council, 2000. LOS ratings are
classified by letters from A to F, and are as follows:

Rating               Description                          Traffic

 A                   Free Flow                            Drivers feel no restrictions.

 B                   Stable Flow                          Drivers feel some
                                                          restrictions.

 C                    Stable Flow                         Drivers somewhat restricted,
                                                          but not
                                                          objectionably so.

 D                   Approaching                          Increased restricted and
                                                          congestion.
                     Unstable Flow

 E                   Capacity                             Substantial restriction,
                                                          serious delays.

 F                   Forced Flow                          Stop and go conditions
                                                          extreme delays.

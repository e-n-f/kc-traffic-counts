Re:     Rezoning of 2100 W. Littleton Boulevard

Dear Community Development Department:

Please accept this letter of intent regarding our proposal to rezone and develop the site located at 2100, 2120 West
Littleton Boulevard, and 5759 South Bemis Street. The site is approximately 4.5 acres and currently zoned as B-2
Commercial Business and R-3 Residential. We have submitted a rezoning application to allow for residential use as a
Planned Development. The current property owner is LBI Group, LLC. Their contact information is 2100 W. Littleton
Blvd., suite 300, Littleton, CO 80120. LBI Group, LLC is reachable by phone at 303-782-0003.

Currently, the site is comprised of three parcels. The first being Lot 1, Block 1 of the Intermountain Subdivision, which
contains 2100 and 2120 West Littleton Boulevard. Both buildings are currently being used as office space consisting of
11,000 square feet. Approximately 5,500 square feet are occupied by the owner. The second, Parcel 2, is a single family
residential lot known as 5759 Bemis Street. Lastly, Parcel 4 is vacant land that contains a railroad right-of-way, a 25 foot
easement for the Englewood City ditch which was relocated and enclosed underground in a 60 inch reinforced concrete
pipe, and a Qwest fiber optic line.

Our development plan includes construction striving to achieve LEED Gold certification for a luxury apartment rental
community. The community is comprised of no more than 250 units or 56 dwelling units per acre. After more than a
dozen meetings with various stakeholders 250 units represents a reduction of 23% from the original application in
October of 2012. The product consists of two buildings which are 2, 3, 4 and 5-story wood frame construction over one
level of concrete podium construction on the southwest portion of the site wrapped around a 5 to 6 level above grade
concrete parking structure. This revised massing, density and planned architectural style is intended to compliment and
respect the historic courthouse in size, style and design components.

This revised density attempts to strike a balance between the adjacent Transitional and Residential zoning on Bemis
Street while still maximizing the economic benefit to the City and support of Downtown Littleton businesses. The
enhanced pedestrian connectivity will contribute to the success of Historic Downtown Littleton and the Downtown
Littleton light rail station as our residents and the Sterne Park neighborhood will be within walking distance to support
these resources.

This community will be the second Class "A" project in Littleton and will be the first built to LEED Gold standards. There
are currently only two existing residential buildings in the Denver Metro Area built to LEED Gold standards. It will target
an actively engaged demographic with an even mix of young couples in their late 20's to early 30's, professional
individuals in their mid-30's and aging boomers between 50 and 65 years old. The common interests of these residents
will be walkable entertainment and services as well as quick access to outdoor activities, trails, and open space.
Approximately 45% of the units will be one-bedroom with 55% two-bedrooms and an average unit size of 892 square
feet. Each unit will be outfitted with premium fixtures and finishes, including quartz or granite countertops with
undermount sinks, and full size washer/dryer machines. Resident parking will be within a secured above ground parking
structure at a ratio of no less than 1.5 spaces per unit. Storage spaces as well as secured bike storage will also be
available on site. The Clubhouse amenities will include a wifi café, sports and entertainment lounge, fitness center
equipped with cardio and strength training machines, and a conference room to support the business needs of
residents. The property's courtyard will feature a large, resort-style pool and spa with barbeque areas and an outdoor
fire pit.
We have a great deal of experience building within high quality, established mixed-use neighborhoods and look forward
to working with the local community and the City of Littleton to design a product that will have a positive impact on the
city. Thank you for your attention to this request and we look forward to working with you.

Sincerely,

Andy Clay
                                                Executive Summary

·   Title work on the property indicates the existing zoning was implemented in 1975. It includes allows
    unconditional uses that are not in the interest of public health and welfare (see Exhibit A). Many uses conflict
    with the Littleton Corridor Study, the Comprehensive Plan and the Sterne Park Neighborhood Plan.

·   The Littleton Corridor Study explicitly states that the existing zoning "allows some commercial uses that are
    incompatible with the redevelopment plan" (see Development Catalyst Sites goal #1 of study fold-out).
    Rezoning of this parcel could not be interpreted as arbitrary and capricious but an opportunity to carry out the
    direction articulated in this study and the other guiding documents and policies.

·   Existing office vacancy within a 1 mile radius of the light rail station is 30%. The existing office space on the site
    consists of only 50% occupancy if you do not account for the ownership group occupancy. Multifamily vacancies
    for buildings less than 20 years old in the City of Littleton are less than 10%.

·   In the last 13 years the Denver Metro Area has observed apartment communities converted to condos and
    condos become rental communities. The 8%-10% shift from howeownership to renting in Colorado and
    throughout the U.S. reflects a large new class of non-transient renters who are not motivated to own.
    Legislation in Colorado now and in the near future makes new condo development infeasible. Residents who
    desire to live in a more dense community with walkable access to transit and retail services have limited
    ownership opportunities. The construction quality of the proposed community is more likely to be a candidate
    for condominium conversion than any currently proposed or under construction in the City of Littleton.

·   According to Apartment Insights (www.apartmentinsights.com) there is currently only one Class "A",
    unrestricted apartment community in Littleton. There are 87 in the entire Metro area.

·   The proposed development represents an equal or higher economic benefit than the most likely use under the
    current zoning (see Exhibits A & B) which would allow up to 200 ­ 300 residential units (depending on size) and
    little or no public input.

·   Littleton Corridor Study and Guidelines identified this specific parcel as a development catalyst in 2002. The
    study identified the goal of "maximizing value" and allowing for a purely residential, "medium density"
    development. Staff has inferred from parts of the same study that approximately 50 DU/acre with flexibility
    (since it is only a guideline) represents "medium density" at this location. This application reflects 56 DU/acre.

·   Adjacent to our property line, only 132 lineal feet of the 445 lineal feet fronting Bemis neighbors are zoned for
    single family residential. The remaining 313 lineal feet is zoned Transitional allowing multifamily townhomes
    and apartments among other commercial uses. Currently, out of the ten structures along the east side of Bemis
    Street (north of Sterne Park), three are operating as businesses and seven are residential homes.

·   Alliance has revised this application several times responding to staff and area stakeholders. This amended
    application responds to the following feedback received from neighbors, the City and stakeholders:
         o Reduce unit count by 20% - 25% ­ this application is a 23% reduction.
         o Break the building into two separate structures ­ this application creates two separate structures and
            allows views into our courtyard and potentially through to the west.
         o Reduce Bemis St and Littleton Blvd heights to 3 stories ­ this application accomplishes this with the 4th
            story being set back so far back as to be unseen from the pedestrian street view.
         o Move heights and density to west and southwest, away from the Courthouse ­ this application consists
            of 3 stories stepping back to four stories at the northwest corner adjacent to the courthouse. The
            highest 5 story with walkout level (reads as 6 stories from the west) does not step up until the elevation
            moves further south.
·   Impact Fees including building permits, plan review, use tax, Arapahoe County Open Space Tax, parks fee, and
    water and sewer systems development fees total over $13,000 per unit. This is double the amount within the
    City of Denver and comparable to Lone Tree, Centennial and Greenwood Village. In addition to these fees
    Alliance is responsible for the following:
         o 100% of the costs to install a traffic signal at the corner of Bemis Street and Littleton Blvd.
         o Widening of pedestrian walk along Alamo Street bridge (including a slush barrier)
         o All streetscape improvements along Bemis St and Littleton Blvd frontage

·   Alliance funded pedestrian improvements will enhance Sterne Park neighborhood pedestrian accessibility to the
    Courthouse and Buck Center complex as well as to Downtown Littleton and the light rail station.

·    Alliance funded park improvements will enhance the floodplain area to the south achieving the goal of
    converting it into a park as articulated in the Littleton Corridor Study (See Implementation goal #3 and
    Development Catalyst Sites goal #1 of study fold-out). Part of these funds may also be available for
    improvements or upgrades to Sterne Park.

·   The proposed project provides an opportunity for Littleton to be the first city outside of Denver proper with a
    community built to LEED Gold standards (see Exhibit C). Only two exist currently in the entire Denver Metro
    area.

·   The proposed project includes third party review during design and construction for FHA, ADA, and Title 9
    compliance assuring that the community treats all prospective residents with equality.

PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT DETAILS:

1. Under the existing zoning district for the B-2 parcel (2100 and 2120 W. Littleton Blvd.), Alliance
would propose a 5-story, 100% commercial building. Under that scenario, the following set of data
would be projected:

        Building Calculations: 379,124 SF
        75,825 SF x 5 stories = 379,124 SF
        13,124 SF of retail
        156,000 SF of office
        210,000 SF of parking (603 spaces total or approx. 120 per floor)

        Projected parking requirement: 586 spaces
        Retail - one space per 200 SF = 66 spaces
        Office - one space per 300 SF = 520 spaces

        Projected population: 902 employees
        902 employees = 150 SF per employee at 80% building efficiency (169,142 x 80% = 135,314/150)

        Projected population of school-age children: N/A

        Traffic generation: 2,819 daily vehicle trips
        2,819 daily vehicle trips (750 trips per 45,000 SF of office space (169,142/45,000 = 3.76 x 750)
        ***

        Additional park land required: N/A

        Availability of services:
        Based on the SF of our proposed development under the B-2 zoning scenario, we would
        anticipate an 8" sewer tap and a 3" water tap.

2. Under the existing zoning district for the R-3 parcel (5759 S. Bemis St.), Alliance would keep the
existing building, a single family residence. Under that scenario, the following set of data would be
projected:

        Projected population: 3

        Projected population of school-age children: 1
       Traffic generation: 9.5 daily vehicle trips
       9.5 X 1 = 9.5 daily vehicle trips***

       Additional park land required: $0
       Since Alliance would not do anything with the R-3 lot, there would be no park impact fees
       generated.

       Availability of services: N/A

3. Under the proposed PD - residential zone district (the combined B-2 and R-3 parcels), Alliance is
proposing a 250 unit, 4 and 5 story apartment building with an internal above-grade parking structure
and a basement condition on a portion of the site. Under that scenario, the following set of data
would be projected:

       Building Calculations:
       44,500 SF x 5 = 222,500 SF
       222,500/890 average unit size = 250 units

       Projected parking requirements: 450
       250 units x 1.5 = 375 residential parking spaces

       Projected population: 500 residents
       250 units x 45% = 113 1 bedrooms averaging 2 individuals per unit
       250 units x 55% = 137 2 bedrooms averaging 2 individual per unit

       Projected population of school-age children: 73 school age children
       .29 x 250 = 73

       Traffic generation: 1,495 daily vehicle trips
       250 units = 1,495 daily vehicle trips****

       Additional park land required: $637,500
       The city code requires payment of park fees in the amount of $2,550 per unit for multifamily
       residential.

       Availability of city services:
       Based on the SF of our development under the proposed PD Residential zoning scenario, we
       would anticipate an 8" sewer tap and a 3" water tap.

                                         Declaration of Public Policy for Rezoning

The Declaration of Public Policy for Rezoning states that the official zoning map should not be amended unless the
amendment is consistent with the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan, and promotes the general welfare of
the community. Alliance's request to rezone the 4.5 acres site known as 2100 & 2120 W. Littleton Boulevard (currently
zoned B-2 Commercial Business) and 5759 S Bemis Street (currently zoned R-3 Residential) to a Residential use Planned
Development will uphold the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan, and promote the general welfare of the
community in the following ways:

Community-Wide Goals & Policies of the Comprehensive Plan
Goal 1: Preserve Littleton's unique identity by protecting historic structures and emphasizing Littleton's distinct social
and economic heritage with consideration giving to:
A. View preservation;
B. Landscape preservation;
C. Topography;
D. Human qualities;
E. Encouragement of variety of housing stock and types of people.
MEETS GOAL:
        a. View Preservation ­ The current B-2 zoning contains no height limits or setbacks and has a FAR
        of 2:1. Alliance's proposed PD Plan will set an overall height limit of 59' feet. Setbacks will range from 10' to 80'
        feet depending on the elevation and floor level (see PD Plan cover sheet for exact measurements). To avoid the
        building reading like a long wall along the west elevation, Alliance has redesigned and broken the building into
        two distinct masses. The building fronting Littleton Boulevard will be of a lower scale in order to preserve solar
        access to the street and not distract from the historic Courthouse. By breaking the building into two distinct
        masses, views west of the mountains and Downtown Littleton will be better preserved from the vantage points
        along Bemis Street.

        b. Landscape Preservation ­ The current site is comprised of grasses and trees. Alliance will make best
        efforts to save and relocate trees during construction. Street trees will be planted at maximum 35'
        intervals along both street frontages. Bemis Street will receive a continuous tree lawn that is a minimum
        of 8' wide. The overall landscaping shall be intensive and provide year round interest.

        c. Topography ­ Due to the sloping grade change on the west portion of the site, Alliance has the
        opportunity to utilize the grade change and create walk-out basement level units that can add additional
        residential units without increasing the overall height of the building. The units will have direct access to
        the planned trail that runs on the west portion of the site and will create great pedestrian connectivity.

        d. Human Qualities ­ The proposed development will attract residents to Downtown Littleton who will be
        able to access all the amenities that historic Main Street has to offer without getting in a car and adding
        to the parking burden. The development will be designed to LEED Gold guidelines.

        e. Encouragement of variety of housing stock and types of people - The planned "Class A" multifamily
        apartment community will attract young professionals, emerging families, and empty nesters with a unit
        mix of 45% one-bedrooms and 55% two-bedrooms. There are no "Class A" apartment communities in
                                                                                                                 1|Page
        Downtown Littleton that are over 50 units in size. With only one Class A rental option available in all of Littleton
        (that isn't age restricted), there is a strong demand for a higher density luxury rental community within walking
        distance to Downtown Littleton. The rezoning application includes parameters that will produce a finished
        luxury, "Class A" product comparable to what Alliance has built in comparable locations within the Denver
        Metro Area.

Goal 2: Develop Littleton's economic independence and reemphasize Downtown as Littleton's economic and social
center.
MEETS GOAL:
        A 250-unit residential apartment community within walking distance to Historic Main Street will develop
        Littleton's economic dependence and reemphasize Downtown as Littleton's economic and social center.
        Future residents will dine, shop, and enjoy entertainment in Downtown Littleton. Approximately 500
        residents of a target demographic with statistically higher discretionary income will walk the short 500
        feet distance to historic Downtown Littleton to support the local business community without adding an
        additional burden to local parking. Additionally, current zoning would require retail/commercial space that could
        diminish Downtown Littleton as an economic and social center. Although it was stated that the current office
        building located on the site has 11 businesses and is 100% leased, it should be noted that the building is 50%
        owner occupied. The current owner continues the market to space, but due to the lack of demand he continues
        to utilize the space rather than have it sit vacant. An economic analysis was completed which highlights the
        commercial vacancy rate within a one mile radius of the Downtown Littleton Light Rail Station is approximately
        30%. Rather than create addition office space, the site could generate more revenue for the City of Littleton
        as a residential development (see attached economic analysis). Proposed rents will range from $1,050 to $2,999
        a month and will require average household incomes of $71,100, assuming 25% of income is spend on rent

Goal 3: Provide adequate public transportation, both within Littleton itself and as links to other communities in the
metropolitan area.
MEETS GOAL:
        The proximity of the site to the Downtown Littleton light rail station will encourage use of public transportation
        among residents. Rather than traveling via car, our residents will be able to take advantage of the convenience
        of the light rail station when commuting to other communities within the metropolitan area or traveling within
        Littleton itself. The Regional Demand Analysis & TOD Market Analysis produced by the City of Denver in 2008
        forecasted the average household per station along the southwest corridor would be 765 between 2005 and
        2030. Station areas along the Southeast and Central lines have exceeded initial baseline projections due to land
        availability within the station areas. Due to lack of developable land within station areas the Southwest line has
        yet to approach densities anywhere near the projected demand. While 700 units at Littleton Station may not be
        attainable, this application provides an opportunity to increase density at this station in a strategic and effective
        way.

Goal 4: Acquire and maintain sufficient park, recreation land, open space and trails to maintain a proper balance
between developed and recreational land use and to make recreational opportunities easily available to all residents.
MEETS GOAL:
       Our site will provide not less than 30% unobstructed open space, but will also contain a trail connection on the
       land adjacent to the west elevation of our building ensuring recreational opportunities are easily available to all
       residents. The intent is for the trail running on our property to link up with the proposed trail that parallel to the
       east of the rail road tracks. During the development process Alliance will also work with the City to pursue ways
       to enhance a portion of the floodplain for recreational use enjoyed by all residents in the area. Residents of our
       proposed project will also enjoy easily available recreational opportunities provided by the Douglas H. Buck
       Recreation center located just north of the property on W. Powers Avenue.

Goal 5: Preserve existing neighborhood values while encouraging any new development to make the most efficient
use of land, resulting in the highest possible standard of living and the best use of natural resources.
                                                                                                                 2|Page
MEETS GOAL:
      The building design will take into account the most efficient use of the 4.5 acre site. The parking structure will be
      completely enclosed by the building and therefore not visible from the street. Other design elements that will
      result in the highest possible standard of living and best use of natural resources includes; providing historic
      views, mountain views, horizontal emphasis, and interface of indoor and outdoor spaces. The proposed project
      will also preserve existing neighborhood values sited in the Sterne Park Neighborhood plan, which will be
      expanded upon later in this narrative. LEED Gold guidelines from the USGBC will insure the community is
      designed to retain value and be environmentally sustainable (see attached LEED durability checklist).

Goal 6: Reduce community and individual property loss from flooding through better storm drainage planning and
improvement of existing drainage facilities.
MEETS GOAL:
        The proposed project will capture the site runoff and convey the runoff to a central water quality pond. Runoff
        from the water quality pond will be released to the existing storm drain facilities adjacent to the site. Alliances'
        team has worked closely with the City of Littleton Engineering to control the storm release, so that runoff from
        the proposed development passes through the adjacent storm facilities prior to the peak flow time of
        concentration within the adjacent facilities.

Goal 7: Promote and maintain an attractive and healthful living environment for present and future Littleton
residents.
MEETS GOAL:
        Benefits of present residents:
           · Alliance is proposing to install a traffic signal at the intersection of W Littleton Boulevard and S Bemis
                Street which will greatly improve the safety of pedestrian and vehicular circulation. Sterne Park
                residents will gain improved pedestrian access across Littleton Boulevard to the Buck Rec Center and to
                Downtown Littleton.
           · Alliance will widen the sidewalk along the W Alamo Avenue Bridge. This was noted as a neighborhood
                concern, as the sidewalk is currently too narrow and becomes un-usable in the winter with excessive
                snow accumulation.
           · Alliance will provide $637,500 in park impact fees that could be used to enhance the flood plain located
                to the south of the site and also enhance Sterne Park amenities.
           · Alliance will build a trail to the south and west of the site, which current residents can utilize to access
                Downtown Littleton
           · View preservation west through the break in the building mass along Bemis Street and along the west
                elevation.
        Benefit to future residents:
           · Residents at the proposed project will be able to enjoy an attractive and healthful living environment.
           · Residents will have access to historic Downtown Littleton for shopping and entertainment
           · Residents will be encouraged to utilize the public transportation as they will be in walking distance to
                the Downtown Littleton light rail station and bus stop.
           · Residents will be close to ample outdoor space for their recreational enjoyment given the proximity to
                Sterne Park and the S. Platte River Trail system.
           · Residents will be future Littleton home buyers.

Goal 8: Encourage prudent conservation measures that will project and assure Littleton's air, water, energy, and land
resources for the future.
MEETS GOAL:
        The proposed project will be built to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold design
        standards and will incorporate the latest design goals to ensure sustainable development. Participation in the
        LEED process demonstrates leadership, innovation, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility. LEED
        provides building owners with the tools they need to immediately impact their buildings performance and
                                                                                                           3|Page
        bottom line, while providing healthy indoor spaces for a building's occupants. LEED certified buildings are
        designed to reduce waste sent to landfills, conserve energy and water, be healthier and safer for occupants,
        and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions.

Housing Policies
Policy 6: Prohibit discrimination in housing by continuing to enforce fair housing laws.
MEETS POLICY:
        Alliance Residential Company is committed to full compliance with Fair Housing laws which prohibit
        discrimination in housing because of race, color, national origin, religion, gender, familial status and disability.
        Alliance also complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by providing reasonable accommodations
        for persons with disabilities. Reasonable is defined as: modifications to an apartment home or common area at
        the resident's expense if the modification is necessary for the disabled person to enjoy use of the apartment
        home and community. Where it is reasonable, the manager of the apartment community may permit
        modification and changes to be made if the disabled person agrees to restore the property to its original
        condition upon leaving the property. Examples of such modifications would be the installation of handrails or
        special door-opening devices, the installation of special signal devices to assist a hearing impaired person, or the
        reservation of a handicapped parking space for a person who must use a wheelchair for mobility. Alliance hires
        a third party consulting service to review all construction documents and perform site visits to verify the
        compliance with ADA, FHA, and Title 9.

Policy 11: Encourage known energy efficient construction techniques in all types of housings.
MEETS POLICY:
        The proposed development will be designed to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold
        guidelines and will incorporate the latest design goals to ensure a sustainable, energy efficient development.
        There are only two LEED Gold certified residential apartment buildings in the entire Metro Denver area. This
        would be the first LEED Gold building in Littleton, including those projects that are currently under construction
        or proposed.

Land Use Policies
Policy 3: New development in the interior of established neighborhoods, not adjacent to arterial streets, should
respect the existing densities and land uses of the neighborhoods in order that character is well preserved.
MEETS POLICY:
        Alliance believes that multifamily residential is an appropriate transitional use. Based on comments received
        from the neighborhood and staff, Alliance has reduced the development from 325 units to 250 units, so the
        lesser building mass and scale will better preserve the existing character of the neighborhood. This represents a
        23% reduction in size as requested by neighbors. Alliance is committed to continue communication with the
        neighborhood through the site plan process and during construction.

Policy 8: Environmentally sensitive areas, such as floodplain, steep slopes, etc., shall be protected from development
in order to prevent adverse effect to these areas.
DOES NOT CONFLICT:
        The floodplain to the south of the site will remain protected from the development.

Policy 9: The City shall continue to encourage that energy and environmental concerns be taken into consideration
with all new residential and commercial developments.
MEETS POLICY:
         The proposed project will be built to LEED Gold guidelines and will incorporate the latest design goals to ensure
         a sustainable, energy efficient development.

Transportation Policies
Policy 1: Improve transportation facilities and traffic controls to provide safe and efficient traffic circulation.
                                                                                                                  4|Page
MEETS POLICY:
       Alliance is proposing to install a traffic signal at the corner of W. Littleton Boulevard and S. Bemis Street. During
       meetings with the neighborhood residents voiced concerns regarding how dangerous it is to try and cross
       Littleton Boulevard at S. Bemis Street. The majority of feedback received was how residents would welcome a
       traffic signal, which would make the intersection much safer and improve both vehicular and pedestrian traffic
       circulation.

Policy 2: Provide traffic controls on internal residential and collector streets to improve safety and to maintain proper
levels of traffic speed and volume.
MEETS POLICY:
         Feedback from the neighborhood residents has caused us to pursue the option of working with the City to install
         a `No Right Turn' sign when exiting our proposed parking garage so residents would be forced to turn left and
         head north to W. Littleton Boulevard. There will also be a built up curb that would make right turns very
         inconvenient. This would help assure the local neighborhood that traffic volume of cars traveling south on S.
         Bemis Street would not dramatically increase due to our proposed development. We will also design the
         entrance/exit in a way that will prohibit cars traveling north on Bemis to enter the development by turning left.
         All access to the development will be right turn only access when traveling south on Bemis Street from Littleton
         Boulevard. Another solution recommend by staff to reduce traffic impacts was to reduce the total unit count.
         Alliance responded to this recommendation and believes the reduction of units from 325 to 250 will also help
         reduce the potential traffic along Bemis Street.

Policy 5: Limit direct access on arterial streets to preserve the safety and traffic carrying capabilities of these
roadways.
        See response to Policy 2.

Urban Design Policies
Policy 4: The City should strengthen the identity of entrances into Littleton.
MEETS POLICY.
        The proposed project would serve as an additional identification element to welcome residents to Downtown
        Littleton while encouraging an active pedestrian presence. The corner elements of the building mass along
        Littleton Blvd. are required to be highly articulated in materials and details even as they are subdued in mass.


Downtown Neighborhood Plan
Policy LU-10: Development adjacent to the identified iconic structures should respect and not detract from their
prominence;
Policy LU-10a: Require that the height, scale, building placement, and other design elements of new construction,
expansion, or other property changes respect and do not overwhelm iconic structures. Employ techniques such as
building setbacks and step-backs for upper stories, and further detail that direction in the Downtown Design
Standards and Guidelines.
MEETS POLICY:
        It is important for the development to not detract from the prominence of the historic Courthouse which is an
        iconic structure. The development has been divided into two building masses. The building mass across from the
        historic courthouse is a lower scale mass, with majority of density being relegated to the southern part of the
        site. Brick will be incorporated at the northeast corner of the building façade that respectfully matches the
        courthouse but does not detract from its prominence. The low scale building mass directly across from the
        courthouse is required to step back significantly after the third story and no fifth story is allowed within 80' of
        Littleton Blvd. right of way. The resultant mass will accord due deference to the historic structure and will
        also preserve solar access for the street.



                                                                                                                5|Page
Policy LU-12: Development in areas that are outside of Downtown but immediately adjacent to Downtown gateways
should be planned with consideration of their proximity to Downtown and their potential role and impact on
Downtown. The four gateways are located at Main Street/Littleton Boulevard, Main Street/Alamo/Santa Fe Drive,
Prince Street/Santa Fe Drive, and Downtown Littleton light rail station;
Policy LU-12a: Plan new development immediately adjacent to Downtown gateways so that they improve connections
to Downtown, function as part of a gateway to Downtown, follow the same design standards, and are consistent with
the Downtown Neighborhood Plan.
MEETS POLICY:
        The western building façade faces and engages with Littleton Downtown and should effectively respond to the
        Downtown area in scale and proportion. This is where the tallest elements of the building design are located.
        The overall building mass is broken up into two building masses which will provide respite to the long facade.
        Furthermore, the two building masses will be sub divided into several sub masses imposing upon the façade a
        scale more reminiscent of a typical Downtown street front with varying planes and parapet heights implying
        several buildings rather than one long one.

        In order to create a development that is engaged and connected with the larger neighborhood, it is vitally
        important to make real connection to the pedestrian network with active ground floor spaces. To this end, the
        parking garage has been surrounded on all sides by dwelling units, thus preventing a large dead mass that
        usually results from an exposed parking garage. The ground floor units all around the building will connect to the
        pedestrian network creating a real connection with Downtown, enhancing safety, and fostering social
        interaction.

Sterne Park Neighborhood Goals
Goal 1: Preserve the unique character of the neighborhood and general "quality of life" aspects, especially the mix of
architectural styles, mature trees, and quiet atmosphere of the residential areas.
MEETS GOAL:
        The building design will take into account the existing architectural styles and quiet atmosphere of the
        residential area. The elevation fronting Bemis Street will step back after the third floor to respond to the
        adjacent residential area. This in turn will create a pedestrian feel, look, and relationship to the neighboring
        residences. Walkout residences on the first floor along Bemis, Littleton Boulevard, and the west side of the
        building will additionally establish a pedestrian scale and feel. The project will have an 8 foot tree lawn on the
        east side of S. Bemis Street. To the greatest extent possible, we will preserve mature trees on the property or
        replace any trees that must be removed during construction. Our property management team will be on site or
        on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to prevent noise violations per the City of Littleton's regulations on that
        matter. Additionally, the interior courtyard will reduce noise impact on Bemis neighbors. Alliance has responded
        to comments from City staff and neighbors by reducing the size and scale of the project. We feel the reduction
        in scale conforms to the neighborhood given the transitional nature of this site. Alliance believes the installation
        of a traffic signal will address any traffic loading issues on Bemis Street. It is also very likely that many of the
        residents will utilize light rail to commute to work. Alliance believes the proposed residential development
        will better preserve the character of the neighborhood more than a use-by-right development which would
        be built on the site today.

Goal 2: Improve transportation facilities and traffic controls only to the extent necessary to improve safety and to
provide good traffic circulation within the neighborhood.
MEETS GOAL:
        A traffic study was conducted which will address traffic controls and provide recommendations to improve
        traffic circulation within the neighborhood. Alliance is proposing to install a traffic signal at the intersection of W
        Littleton Boulevard and S Bemis Street. The improved safety of the Bemis/W. Littleton intersection will
        encourage more residents west of the development to walk Downtown, rather than take their cars to avoid the
        difficult and sometimes dangerous intersection. We have positioned the entry/exit into our parking garage well


                                                                                                                   6|Page
        to the south of the W. Littleton Boulevard with the hopes that there will be enough space on S. Bemis Street to
        accommodate everyone leaving the garage to turn left and head north on S. Bemis Street.

Goal 3: Prohibit encroachment of commercial uses into established residential areas by limiting such uses to existing
commercial districts such as Littleton Boulevard.
DOES NOT CONFLICT:
        A rezoning application has been submitted to allow for residential use on a site that was zoned for both
        residential (5759 Bemis) and B-2 commercial (2100 and 2120 W Littleton).

Goal 4: Preserve existing parks and open space and encourage new or expanded recreational areas to be developed to
provide natural, passive recreation opportunities.
DOES NOT CONFLICT:
        There are no existing parks and or open space on the current site. There is a large flood plain to the south of
        the site, which will remain. However, we would like to propose improved access to the flood plain land as a
        potential way to offset our park impact fees, so residents and neighbors may better enjoy the open space.

Goal 5: Improve enforcement of the City's environmental codes to assure neighborhood preservation through good
maintenance, adherence to noise ordinance, and crime prevention.
MEETS GOAL:
        Alliance Residential will not only develop and build the project, but will manage the project upon completion.
        Alliance is the 15th largest management company in the U.S. and our size is a testament to our scope and depth
        of industry knowledge. The on-site staff will monitor and oversee the continued maintenance of the property.
        We can ensure adherence to noise ordinances through our lease agreements and prior to signing a lease, all
        potential residents must pass the necessary background and credit checks.

Transportation Policies
Policy 1: That traffic controls in internal residential and collector streets be maintained or improved to improve safety
and to prevent further increases in speed and volume of traffic.
MEETS POLICY:
        Feedback from the neighborhood residents has caused us to pursue the option of working with the City to install
        a `No Right Turn' sign when exiting our proposed parking garage so residents would be forced to turn left and
        head north to W. Littleton Boulevard. There will also be a built up curb that would make right turns very
        inconvenient. This would help assure the local neighborhood that traffic volume of cars traveling south on S.
        Bemis Street would not dramatically increase due to our proposed development. We will also design the
        entrance/exit in a way that will prohibit cars traveling north on Bemis to enter the development by turning left.
        All access to the development will be right turn only access when traveling south on Bemis Street from Littleton
        Boulevard. Another solution recommend by staff to reduce traffic impacts was to reduce the total unit count.
        Alliance responded to this recommendation and believes the reduction of units from 325 to 250 will also help
        reduce the potential traffic along Bemis Street.

Land Policies
Policy 1: That development of commercial uses south of Littleton Boulevard, beyond that which is presently zoned
commercial, in residential areas of the neighborhood, be prohibited.
DOES NOT CONFLICT:
        The site is currently zoned B2 and R-3 residential and we are requesting a residential use Planned Development.

Policy 2: That emphasis in the decision-making process be placed on the preservation of the neighborhood as a sound,
desirable residential area.
MEETS POLICY:
        Alliance is committed to continue communicating with the neighborhood through the design and construction
        process.
                                                                                                             7|Page
Code Enforcement Policies
Policy 1:That the environmental code adopted by the City, which requires land owners to maintain the landscaping on
rental property, including renter-occupied, single-family dwellings, be strongly enforced to preserve the well-
maintained character of the neighborhood and to protect adjacent property owners from adverse impacts of poor
maintenance.
MEETS POLICY:
        Alliance Residential Company's management team will have maintenance staff on site 7 days a week to ensure
        the property is well maintained. In addition, a professional landscaping company will be hired to provide
        ongoing landscaping upkeep of the property.

Policy 2: That a concerted, intensified effort should be taken to control vandalism.
MEETS POLICY:
        Alliance Residential Company will have property management staff on site during regular business hours. After
        regular business hours, a security guard will monitor the site. As a courtesy patrol, Alliance will also offer a free
        or discounted unit to one or two local police officers who can live on site and assist with security. The property
        will also have access control key fobs, alarm systems, and video monitoring.

Littleton Boulevard Corridor Study
1C1: Massing/Height/Scale Goal: To moderate scale changes between adjacent lots.
1C1.2: Building form next to Littleton Boulevard and Bemis Street should be a maximum of three stories, stepping up
in height away from the building.
MEETS GOAL:
         Alliance has redesigned our building based on comments received from the City staff and neighborhood. We are
         proposing three stories along Bemis and Littleton, stepping back in height 25' on floor 3, 45' on floor 4 and 80'
         on floor 5.

1C3: Architectural character Goals: The architectural character should complement the existing historic architecture
of this subarea and to create buildings that provide human scale, interest, and variation.
MEETS Goal:
         Due to feedback from staff and the neighborhood, Alliance has adjusted the architectural design so as to better
         complement the existing historic character of the Courthouse and neighborhood. Similar color brick that
         matches the Courthouse will be used on the northeast corner of the north building mass. Also, instead of using
         only flat roofs, pitched and sloped roof elements will be strategically integrated into the building design. Direct
         access to sidewalks and pathways from ground level units will encourage an active lifestyle, foster social
         interactions and enhance safety.

1C4: Materials/Color Goal: To relate new construction to that of existing construction through the use of similar scale
elements and to use materials that conveys a sense of quality, permanence, and care.
MEETS GOAL:
       The primary building masses shall be broken up into smaller secondary masses that create a more residential
       scale with organized rhythm on the facades. Overall, brick, masonry and cast stone masonry materials shall
       constitute 35% of all exterior building materials, not counting openings. The color palette will be warm hued and
       will draw inspiration from surrounding historic context. By building to LEED Gold guidelines quality and
       permanence of the building will be ensured.

2A1 Goal 1: To terminate the view from Alamo Avenue looking east in an attractive way.
2A1 Goal 2: To present an attractive west façade to the light rail station and Downtown.
2A1.2: Building mass is preferred at the intersection of Littleton Boulevard and the railroad line to emphasize a
gateway to the Littleton Boulevard Corridor.
MEETS GOAL:
                                                                                                                 8|Page
        Alliance has broken the building into two distinct masses that will present an attractive west façade to the light
        rail station and Downtown. Highly articulated bay or other form breaks long the building mass will serve as a
        culmination of axial view from eastbound Alamo Avenue.

2A2: Vehicular access and parking Goal: To minimize the view of parking from Littleton Boulevard, Alamo Avenue, and
the Downtown light rail stop.
2A2.1: At grade parking lots and/or above grade parking structures should not extend along the entire length or
majority of the site boundary that faces the light rail stop.
2A2.2: Parking lots or above grade parking structures should not extend along the Littleton Boulevard Frontage.
MEETS GOAL:
        Alliance will have a fully wrapped parking garage that will not be visible from the street. The garage will not
        extend along the west elevation of the site or along Littleton Boulevard.

2A3: Pedestrian circulation and access Goal: To make easy and attractive pedestrian connections to the light rail stop
and Downtown.
MEETS GOAL:
       Alliance will add a trail that runs to the south and west of the site creating pedestrian circulation from Bemis
       Street through the open space and around the site to the sidewalk along Littleton Boulevard and Alamo Avenue.
       Alliance will widen the sidewalk along the Alamo Bridge to improve pedestrian access to the light rail stop and
       Downtown. The addition of a traffic signal will also make it safer and easier to cross Littleton Boulevard at Bemis
       Street.

2C1 Massing and Height Goal: To reflect the scale and height of the adjacent neighborhood and historic Courthouse
and to maintain a two to three story edge to Littleton Boulevard, particularly along the south side to provide more sun
exposure to the street.
2C1.1: Higher building forms should be located at the southwest and west portions of the site stepping down toward
Littleton Boulevard and Bemis Street. No building shall exceed the height of the Courthouse, 81 feet.
MEETS GOAL:
         Alliance has broken the building into two distinct masses so the west elevation will no longer be a 500 foot wall
         that may overpower the importance of the Courthouse. The building has been designed with more aggressive
         step backs along Littleton and Bemis, with the majority of the higher building forms located at the southwest
         and west portions of the site. We are proposing three stories along Bemis and Littleton, stepping back in height
         25' on floor 3, 45' on floor 4 and 80' on floor 5. The lower scale mass along Littleton Boulevard will
         preserve solar access to the street and will not detract from the Courthouse.

2C1.2: The building along Bemis Street should respect the scale and pattern of the houses across the street through
such design strategies as the articulation of building form, column/pier spacing, window pattern, and similar
approaches.
MEETS GOAL:
        By breaking the building into two distinct masses the design is able to better respect the scale and pattern of the
        eight houses/businesses across the street on Bemis.

February 2002 Littleton Boulevard Corridor Study Folded Map: Identifies the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Facility site as
a Development Catalyst Site
       Alliance is proposing the highest and best use for this property. The site was identified as a Development
       Catalyst Site and it was highlighted that the site is the closest redevelopment site to the Littleton Downtown
       Light Rail Station. Medium density residential uses were recommended although the staff noted in their
       comments that median density was not defined. Our project would yield 56 dwellings units per acre which we
       believe falls into the range of "median density". Additionally, by reducing the size and scale of our project,
       Alliance has designed a project that will complement the scale of the historic Courthouse.


                                                                                                               9|Page
COMPLIANCE WITH PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
Intent: The Planned Development District (PD) District is hereby created to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare by allowing more flexible development, based upon a comprehensive, integrated plan. For the
purpose of applying certain regulations and standards, and to insure maximum flexibility, the PD District is divided
into subdistrict designations, listed below, based on the primary land use on all or a portion of the land covered by a
general PD Plan. By creating these subdistricts, the Council recognizes that all standards and regulations do not apply
uniformly to all land uses. These subdistricts may exist singly or in combination on any approved general PD Plan,
provided that the specific standards and regulations applicable to the respective subdistricts are met.

Application and Intent: Further, in the application of this Section it is the intent of Council to:
1. Encourage more creative and effective use of land and public or private services, and to accommodate changes in
land development technology so that the resulting economies benefit the community.
       The proposed project and our associated park fees will encourage the City to enhance the flood plain to the
       south of the site. The flood plain is an area of land that would greatly benefit from a more creative and effective
       use. It is our hope that park-like enhancements will allow local residents to better enjoy the flood plain area.
       Additionally, we are proposing a trail connection through the flood plain to connect residents to the regional
       trail which will run parallel to the train tracks and through the west portion of our site. We want to capitalize on
       the sites great proximity to the Littleton Light Rail Station and encourage pedestrian connectivity to the greatest
       extent possible. Our innovative construction technology will allow us to conceal almost all parking except for a
       small fraction of visitor and prospective resident parking. We will accommodate changes in land development
       technology by building to US Green Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
       (LEED) certification at the Gold level. This results in operating efficiencies for energy and resource usage
       including water, electricity and gas ultimately minimizing the burden on City infrastructure. It represents a
       minimum of 15% improved energy efficiency over typical development standards. It also requires subcontractor
       training for waste recycling and material installation among many other details. Final certification is based on
       construction documentation and commissioning of major operating systems by third party consultant.

2. Encourage innovation and efficiency in residential development to meet the growing demands for housing of all
types and designs for persons of any social or economic status.
        Our project will have a mix of one and two bedroom units. Operating efficiencies of the LEED construction
        system will reduce operating expenses allowing luxury apartments at a premium location to be within the price
        range of teachers, administrative staff, as well as doctors, aerospace engineers, defense contractors and retired
        empty nesters. Alliance Residential Company is committed to full compliance with Fair Housing laws which
        prohibit discrimination in housing because of race, color, national origin, religion, gender, familial status and
        disability. Alliance also complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by providing reasonable
        accommodations for persons with disabilities. Reasonable is defined as: modifications to an apartment home or
        common area at the resident's expense if the modification is necessary for the disabled person to enjoy use of
        the apartment home and community. Where it is reasonable, the manager of the apartment community may
        permit modification and changes to be made if the disabled person agrees to restore the property to its original
        condition upon leaving the property. Examples of such modifications would be the installation of handrails or
        special door-opening devices, the installation of special signal devices to assist a hearing impaired person, or the
        reservation of a handicapped parking space for a person who must use a wheelchair for mobility.

3. Encourage innovative development or redevelopment of all land uses to meet the contemporary needs of the
community by providing for a greater variety and mix of uses including those which may coexist on the same parcel or
within the same building as shown on an approved PD Plan.
        The intent of this project is to bring a concentration of new customers to the existing Downtown Littleton
        businesses without adding vehicular traffic. This higher density could encourage more diverse businesses on
        Main Street such as specialty grocers or markets. However, residents are provided with many onsite amenities
        for convenience and recreation including:
                                                                                                               10 | P a g e
            ·   Resort-style swimming pool and spa with outdoor tables, seating and garden lighting
            ·   Commercial grade outdoor bbq grills in garden courtyard
            ·   Indoor/outdoor rooftop observatory lounge providing all residents access to the spectacular mountain
                and night sky views
            ·   Indoor Wi-Fi/media cafe with 24 hour access to printing, coffee, tea and fresh water providing a social
                environment to residents who work from home
            ·   Large conference room with multimedia presentation capabilities providing a professional environment
                for residents who work from home
            ·   Large commercial grade fitness center with 24 hour access including free weights, yoga/pilates studio,
                cardio machines and crossfit or TRX training area
            ·   Media lounge with multiple flat screen televisions and game tables available for residents to reserve and
                use for private events. Also open during business hours.
            ·   Bicycle repair space and secured bicycle storage to encourage multiple transit options from the
                community

4. Provide a process which relates the design and development of a site to the particular characteristics of the site.
        The most particular characteristic of the site is its proximity to the Downtown Littleton Light Rail Station. The
        station is an outcome of millions of dollars of infrastructure investment that needs to be leveraged for the
        benefit of the community. By locating a dense multifamily project in the immediate vicinity of Mass Transit,
        several objectives are achieved such as, Economic Vitality, Enlarged Tax Base, Sustainable Development, Healthy
        Living, and Sustainable Transportation. A dense multifamily development has proven itself to be the most viable
        and necessary form of development in the vicinity of transit stops in the region. This project continues that
        trend.

5. Require that the nature and intensity of development be supported by adequate utilities, transportation network,
drainage systems and open space to serve the development, and to minimize impacts on adjacent existing and future
development.
       Based on Strategic Land Solution's (SLS) conversations with City Engineering staff, the existing utilities are
       capable of supporting this project. The preliminary design connects the building effluent line to the existing
       sanitary sewer main located in Littleton Boulevard. Water will be served by the main in S. Bemis Street, with a
       new fire hydrant connecting to the existing main in Littleton Boulevard. The existing water infrastructure is
       capable of supplying the expected fire flow requirements. Based on SLS's conversations with Xcel Energy and
       Century Link communications, there is sufficient existing natural gas, electrical, and telecommunications
       facilities near the project to serve the expected development requirements. Residents will have walkable access
       to the Downtown Littleton Light Rail Station and RTD bus service. The development will also provide the
       required 1.5 parking spaces per units so residents can park their cars within our fully enclosed parking garage.
       Alliance will also provide a traffic signal at the corner of S. Bemis Street and Littleton Boulevard, if warranted by
       the City. The development will also provide 30% open space and through coordination with the City through the
       use of park impact fees generated by the project, will enhance the flood plain to the south of our site and add a
       trail connection on the west portion of our property.

6. Encourage development that is consistent with the policies and guidelines established in the adopted
Comprehensive Plan for the area and for the City.
       See attached for our Compliance with the Comprehensive Plan.

ADDITIONAL MATERIALS
A) The applicant shall submit a statement of the terms and conditions under which the subject property will be
developed and maintained subsequent to development. Such a statement shall include conditions, performance
standards and such other reasonable restrictions as may be necessary to ensure development and maintenance of the
subject property in full accordance with the approved PD Plan.
        During construction, Alliance will follow the Good Neighborhood Construction Policy:
                                                                                                               11 | P a g e
The Owners agree to implement a plan of construction management techniques, including the following:
    · Project Manager cell phone 24/7
    · Address parking for workers (on-site if possible)
    · No trucks and back up beeps before 8 a.m.
    · Construction weekdays 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. / weekends 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
    · Dust mitigation methods, including without limitation, water wagons for construction and dust control
    · Use a website for the purpose of updating the Sterne Park Neighborhood property owners of important
      dates (such as street closures and water interruption) and generally for project updates. Provide a
      complaint forum via email so that neighborhood concerns are able to be expressed on a timely basis.

The Owners will adhere to the "4 C's"
Communication with Neighbors Can Facilitate Cooperation and Support
The 4-C Solution:
1. Communication: Builders who communicate while attempting to limit the impact that construction invariably
causes will win the tolerance of the neighboring residents. A sign on the site, a flyer, a letter to residents in the
immediate area explaining the project and the anticipated schedule can alleviate much of the residents'
concerns about the short-term problems commonly generated by construction

2. Common Sense: While it is the nature of construction to be messy, noisy and paced to meet the pressure of
deadlines and budgets, neighborhood sites require special consideration. Neighbors and builders must
acknowledge the root of the situation ­ the area is both a neighborhood, where people retreat from the work-a-
day world, and a job site, where time is money and money is the bottom line. Residents' concerns arise when
construction practices continually go beyond the limits of common sense.

3. Courtesy: Builders can work to the limit of the law, which allows construction noise from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.
seven days a week. Thoughtful contractors who make the effort to schedule the more disruptive aspects of the
project to take place during weekdays between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. should expect few complaints from the
surrounding residents. Builders who respect neighbors' concerns and take action to remedy or modify a
problem will find that that kind of consideration should gain friendly support during the project.

4. Compromise: Compromise begins when builders and neighbors consider each other's point of view.
Compromise takes place through friendly communication between neighbors, the Owners and the contractors

GUIDELINES FOR BUILDERS
Informing Neighbors: At least two days in advance of construction or demolition, the Owners should:
1. Call or meet with as many neighbors as possible
2. Mail letters or flyers describing project
3. Post a sign at the site with a phone number for questions

During Construction: Considerate site policies and procedures should be specifically outlined for the
contractors' employees as well as any sub-contractors on the job.
1. Limit working hours of high noise operations to the middle of the day at least until the structure is fully
enclosed
2. Limit and control radio noise
3. Consider neighbor's exposure in sitting and screening the project's mechanical equipment
4. Place the dumpster on the lot or on the street in the middle of the site
5. Avoid blowing debris and accumulation of clutter
6. Cover the dumpster with a tarp bound by cord to contain dust and debris and to control unauthorized use of
the dumpster
7. Park construction vehicles off-street if possible. Turn off engines unless operating other equipment
8. Place portable toilets away from the property lines in less visible locations; arrange for regular service
                                                                                                        12 | P a g e
        9. Control dust with water and chutes
        10. Avoid damage to trees and landscaping

        To obtain LEED Gold Certification, the construction quality will be enhanced to achieve premium durability
        above applicable building and energy code in the following areas:
        1. Exterior Water/Moisture
        2. Interior Water/Moisture
        3. Air Infiltration
        4. Interstitial Condensation
        5. Pests
        6. Heat Loss
        7. Ultraviolet Radiation

        Alliance Residential Company is a fully integrated, national operating company that is focused on acquiring,
        owning, developing, and managing rental multi-family properties throughout the United States. Broadstone at
        Littleton Station will be owned and operated by Alliance and will be held to high performance standards. Some
        of the development features will include FHA/ADA compliant design construction and certification, and LEED
        certification. During construction the property will follow a professional erosion and sediment control plan that
        will be verified through field certification. Alliance will utilize professional landscape design and will establish a
        continued maintenance plan. The design goal for the landscaping, as well as the exterior site lighting, will be to
        ensure a pedestrian scale throughout the project and its perimeter. The experience that Alliance Residential
        Company has in the multifamily residential market is clearly highlighted through their property management
        success. The property management staff will be on site seven days a week during regular business hours. After
        hours the site will be monitored by 24 hour on-call staff. Additionally, the site will have 24 hour parking patrol
        which will be regulated by permits, and in the winter months there will be 24 hour snow removal. Lease
        agreements will set limitations on what residents can keep on their balconies to minimize balcony storage. The
        property will also be designed with a central rooftop satellite dish to help avoid additional balcony clutter.


B) The applicant shall submit a written description of the objectives to be achieved by the particular development
concept being proposed. This statement shall include, but is not limited to, the manner in which the proposed
development meets or exceeds the intent of the planned development district, the proposed architectural and site
design concepts including style; placement of structures to maximize views and take advantage of the site's natural
characteristics; building materials (type, textures and colors); specific concepts by which the proposed development
will make an orderly transition from existing adjacent development including varied setbacks and facade treatment,
additional open space, screening of parking areas and landscaping of all public and private open spaces and
recreational facilities. It is the intent of this requirement that the applicant provide a clear, concise statement for the
reviewing authorities to better understand the proposed development concept and upon which a decision regarding
the proposal may be based.
Design Objectives:
     1. Respect the Historic Courthouse by scaling back the building on the corner of Littleton Blvd and Bemis St.
     2. Create a Gateway to Downtown Littleton by locating a highly articulated building mass on the northwest
        corner, away from the courthouse but closer to Downtown.
     3. Relate to the lower scale buildings along Bemis Street by setting back the first two stories by 20', the third story
        by 25', the fourth story by 45' and the fifth story by 80'. This will also preserve solar access for the buildings
        across the street.
     4. Relate to the lower scale buildings along Bemis Street by breaking up the lower story masses into many smaller
        blocks.
     5. Create an inviting and unimposing entry by limiting the height of the entry structure to one or two stories.
     6. Create a safe vehicular environment by adding a much required traffic signal on Littleton Blvd & Bemis St
        intersection.
                                                                                                                 13 | P a g e
    7. Upgrade outdated infrastructure by widening & replacing Bemis St fronting the site.
    8. Create a safe community that fosters social interaction by connecting the ground floor units to public
        walkways.
    9. Integrate the building into existing pedestrian infrastructure by providing a connection through the
        development for a regional trail.
    10. Respond to the view from Alamo Ave by creating a prominent highly articulated building element that
        culminates the vista from eastbound Alamo Avenue.
    11. Mitigate the length of the West Façade by breaking up the building into two masses and then further breaking
        the façades into smaller sub-masses.
    12. Screen Parking from View by locating all resident parking in a garage that is surrounded on all sides by
        dwellings.
    13. Preserve Open Space in at least 30% percent of the site. This exceeds the PD requirements.
    14. Place a 59' height limit on the project. This is more stringent than the existing zoning.
    15. Limit the use to Residential only. This is more stringent than existing zoning which allows umpteen uses, some
        of which could be considered public nuisances.
    16. Use high quality building materials. Overall, brick masonry and cast stone masonry shall constitute at least 35%
        of all exterior building materials, not counting the openings. Cementitious stucco, cementitious panels, and
        metal panels shall constitute the other exterior building materials.
    17. Fit into existing neighborhood by utilizing warm hued color palettes inspired by the surrounding architecture.
    18. Mitigate light reflection pollution by limiting glass reflectivity on the west face of the building.
    19. Take advantage of the views by locating balconies and large openings especially along the south and west
        frontages.
    20. Provide highly amenetized common areas including Courtyard, Pool, Roof Deck, Lounge, & Fitness room for the
        residents.
    21. Provide a native xeric landscape that fits into the neighborhood, uses less water, and creates a year-round
        interest.
    22. Provide a sustainable building that contributes to the environment by pursuing LEED certification.

C) The applicant shall submit a written statement of the tentative time schedule for phased development. The
statement shall include the type of development, density, floor area ratios, etc., for each phase of development, and
shall be accompanied by a map generally designating the phases and the sequence of development.
        Alliance Residential Company plans on developing and financing Broadstone at Littleton Station as one phase.
        Pending rezoning, site plan and building permit approvals, construction of the residential development will
        begin December 2013. The leasing center and clubhouse will open first, approximately 14 months after the start
        of construction, in February 2015. Units will then be leased up at a rate of 25 units per month resulting in a fully
        completed project by November 2015. We are currently planning for a maximum of 250 units ranging in size
        from 599 square feet to 1,250 square feet. These units will include a mix of 45% one bedroom/one bathroom
        and 55% two bedrooms/two bathrooms.

Broadstone at Littleton Station Residential Redevelopment Traffic Impact Analysis, 2nd Edition



I.       INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this report is to provide information specifically related to the traffic impacts
associated with the redevelopment of the existing property located on the southwest corner of
Littleton Boulevard and Bemis Street in Littleton, Colorado. Figure 1 shows the location of this
development in relation to the other roadways in the vicinity of the project site. A previous traffic
study was completed by Felsburg, Holt & Ullevig for this site in September 2005 entitled
Downtown Littleton Transit Oriented Development. Some of the same assumptions developed
for that study were used in the analyses completed for this report.

Currently, the project site includes two buildings with a combined total of about 33,000 square
feet of professional office space. These buildings would be razed and replaced with a 250 unit
apartment building. The proposed plan for the site can be seen on Figure 2.

Direct access to the project site is currently and will continue to be provided via Bemis Street.
No direct access to the project site is planned along Littleton Boulevard.

The purposes of this study are (1) to evaluate the impact that traffic generated by the proposed
development will have on key intersections in the study area and (2) to determine any needed
mitigation measures or transportation improvements. This study will assess the impacts

II.       EXISTING CONDITIONS
A.        Existing Traffic Volumes and Crash Data

Existing traffic volumes at key locations in the site vicinity are provided on Figure 3. This figure
also shows the existing pedestrian traffic utilizing the crosswalk located just west of Bemis
Street. Currently there are approximately 30 pedestrians crossing Littleton Boulevard during
both the AM and PM peak hours. Traffic data was collected in October 2012 and is provided in
Appendix A.

In addition, three years (2010 to 2012) of crash data for the intersection of Littleton Boulevard
and Bemis Street were also reviewed to determine if a correctable crash pattern exists. An
intersection diagram as well as a crash listing can be found in Appendix A. During the three
year period, there were a total of 10 crashes at this intersection, 8 of which were rear end
crashes that occurred on Littleton Boulevard.

B.        Existing Roadway Network

The existing transportation network in the site vicinity includes the following key roadways:

      ·   Littleton Boulevard: This 4-lane minor arterial extends east from Downtown Littleton to
          Broadway. Littleton Boulevard splits into one-way streets through the downtown area of
          Littleton, with the westbound direction being Main Street and the eastbound direction
          being Alamo Avenue.

      ·   Bemis Street: This 2-lane local street extends south from Littleton Boulevard to Lake
          Street. This road serves both residential and commercial uses. Daily traffic count data
          indicates that Bemis Street currently carries about 960 vehicles per day (vpd) just south
          of Littleton Boulevard.

      ·   Lake Street: This collector street extends east of Prince Street to Windermere Street.
          The intersection of Lake Street and Bemis Street is a 4-way stop-sign controlled facility.

C.        Intersection Capacity

Capacity analyses were conducted at the three study area intersections using analysis methods
documented in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010, December 2010 by the Transportation
Research Board. The analysis software Synchro 8 was utilized in these analyses. These
analyses use the existing traffic volumes and intersection lane geometry to develop a level of
service (LOS), a measure of the ease of traffic flow through an intersection. Level of service A
represents relatively uninterrupted flow with little or no vehicle delay, while LOS F represents
undue delay and excessive congestion.

Using the HCM criteria, the existing traffic volumes, intersection lane assignments and traffic
control measures, capacity analyses of these intersections were conducted. Currently the
intersections at Littleton Boulevard and the site access operate as two way stop controlled
intersections while the intersection at Lake Avenue is an all way stop controlled intersection.




                                                                                              Page 4
Broadstone at Littleton Station Residential Redevelopment Traffic Impact Analysis, 2nd Edition



As can be seen on Figure 3, the majority of the movements at the intersections currently
operate at LOS C or better during both peak hours. The only exception is the northbound
approach to Littleton Boulevard during the PM peak which currently operates at LOS E. Level of
service worksheets for existing conditions may be found in Appendix B.

III.   BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
A.     Traffic Volume Projections

Background traffic consists of vehicle-trips on the roadway network not related to the proposed
residential development. First, traffic from the existing site currently using the study intersections
was removed from the turning movements since the existing office buildings will be removed
and replaced by the proposed development. The existing daily traffic on Bemis Street just south
of Littleton Boulevard was reduced based on the assumption that the AM Peak hour traffic
to/from the site is approximately 10 percent of the daily traffic. This is a reduction of
approximately 200 vehicles on Bemis Street just south of Littleton Boulevard. Background traffic
volumes for this traffic analysis were then developed based on an annual growth rate of
approximately 0.5 percent. This is based on information from historic traffic counts completed by
the City of Littleton in the vicinity of the site. Given that the area in the vicinity of the site is
nearly built out a 0.5 percent grow rate is not uncommon.

Projected Year 2014 background traffic volumes are depicted on Figure 4 while Year 2035
background traffic volumes are shown on Figure 5.

B.     Capacity Analyses

Once the future traffic volumes had been determined, a level of service analysis was completed
for each of the future scenarios. The results of this analysis can be seen on Figures 4 and 5
and the level of service worksheets can be found in Appendices C and D. For the Year 2014
background traffic scenario, all of the stop-controlled intersections are anticipated to operate at
LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak hours with the existing lane geometry in place. In
2035, most of the stop controlled approaches are expected to operate at LOS C or better with
the exception of the northbound Bemis Street approach at Littleton Boulevard which is expected
to operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour.

IV.         TRIP GENERATION AND TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT
A.          Trip Generation

The amount of traffic that the project site is expected to generate was estimated from data
documented by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in their manual titled Trip
Generation, 9th Edition.

Given that the project site is situated immediately adjacent to a major light rail transit station, it is
anticipated that a portion of the trips oriented to/from the project site will be transit related,
thereby reducing the potential amount of vehicle traffic that the project site will generate. Transit
reduction factors from Table B.3 of the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition, were applied
to the total vehicle-trip generation for the project site. Specifically, a 10% trip reduction was
applied to the residential trips generated by this site. Of note, this is the same reduction utilized
in the September 2005 study.

Table 1 summarizes the total estimated vehicle-trips that will be generated by the proposed
development.

 du = dwelling units

As shown in Table 1, it is estimated that the project site will generate a total of approximately
1,490 vehicle-trips per day with a total of 115 vehicle-trips during the AM peak hour and 140
vehicle-trips during the PM peak hour.

B.          Assignment of New Site Generated Trips

The distribution of site generated vehicle trips was based upon existing travel patterns in the
study area. The estimated trip distribution is as follows:

      ·     45% oriented to/from the east via Littleton Blvd,
      ·     35% oriented to/from the west via Littleton Blvd/Alamo Ave.,
      ·     10% oriented to/from the west via Lake Street,
      ·     6% oriented to/from the east via Lake Street,
      ·     4% oriented to/from the south via Bemis Street




                                                                                                  Page 10

The trip distribution percentages identified above are graphically shown on Figure 6. The site
generated vehicle trips from Table 1 were assigned to the each of the study intersections
according to the distribution patterns identified above. The resulting total site generated traffic
volumes are provided on Figure 6.

V.     FUTURE CONDITIONS WITH DEVELOPMENT
A.     Total Traffic Volumes

Year 2014

Figure 7 depicts total Year 2014 traffic volumes. These traffic volumes were calculated by
adding together the background traffic volumes shown on Figure 4 and the site generated traffic
volumes shown on Figure 6.

Long-Term Future (Year 2035)

Figure 8 depicts the total traffic volumes in the long term future. These traffic volumes were
calculated by adding together the background traffic volumes shown on Figure 5 and the site
generated traffic volumes shown on Figure 6.

B.     Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis

The MUTCD identifies nine warrants that provide guidance to determine whether installation of
a traffic signal is justified. Some of these warrants are based on traffic volume or pedestrian
volume levels, while others are based on the crash history of an intersection.

When evaluating future traffic conditions at Littleton Boulevard and Bemis Street per this study,
Warrant 3 (Peak Hour Volume), Warrant 4 (Pedestrian Volume) and Warrant 7 (Crash
Experience) were evaluated. The MUTCD states that Warrant 3 should only be used for
analyzing intersections that have unusual traffic characteristics such as a large number of
vehicles discharging over a short timeframe like during shift work at a factory. That is not the
case for this project. As such, traffic signal warrant analyses using Warrant 3 are only included
in this analysis as a guide for the potential of signalization in the future, not as a
recommendation.

Considering these factors, it is possible that a traffic signal may be warranted in the future at the
intersection of Littleton Boulevard and Bemis Street due to vehicle volume and delay but is
unlikely due to pedestrian volume or crash experience. A pedestrian volume of approximately
100 pedestrians per hour is needed to meet Warrant 4. The current pedestrian volume is 30
pedestrians per hour. Vehicle safety could be a consideration at this intersection due to the
difficult northbound to westbound left turn movement that could result in collisions but the crash
history currently does not include collisions involving northbound left turning vehicles. This
should be monitored in the future.

With respect to traffic volumes, the forecasts shown in this report suggest that the Littleton
Boulevard/Bemis Street intersection would be a borderline condition relative to satisfying the
relevant warrants, when considered in isolation. However, the potential exists to incorporate the
Littleton Boulevard/Court Place intersection, located 190 feet to the west, into the signalization.
There are several considerations that would contribute to the need for signalizing this offset
intersection system, and they include:

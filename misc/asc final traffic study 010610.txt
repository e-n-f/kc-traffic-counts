                     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Traffic Impact Study (TIS) document is intended as a supplemental to the overall
submittal for the Adams State College Campus Auxiliary Housing New Building project,
located in the City of Alamosa, Colorado. The following is a summary of the traffic
information and findings included in this report.

   1. Adams State College is modifying the campus in Alamosa, Colorado to add a new
      housing building and enhancement of the area adjacent to Rex Field. As part of this
      project, the College has proposed to vacate the portion of Stadium Drive between
      First Street and El Rio Drive. Also included with this project is the relocation of some
      of the surface and on-street parking to a new lot north of First Street at Faculty Drive.
      The closing of Stadium Drive is anticipated to result in the redistribution of both
      campus traffic and local (non-campus) traffic.

   2. The project site plan has been provided and is shown on Exhibit 2, herein. Along with
      the vacation of Stadium Drive between First Street and El Rio Drive, Monterey Avenue
      is proposed to be converted from the current one-way northbound operation between
      First Street and El Rio Drive to accommodating two-way traffic for the entire length of
      the roadway.

   3. This report includes an evaluation and assessment of the study area for the existing
      conditions, short-term conditions and the long range conditions. The short-term
      conditions represent the near-term immediately after the completion of the Adams
      State College Campus Auxiliary Housing New Building project, which is expected to
      be completed next year (Year 2010). The long range conditions considered both the
      potential impact of any planned changes within the study area and those proposed as
      part of the Adams State College Campus project, approximately 20 years into the
      future (Year 2030).

   4. According to the City of Alamosa staff, a level of service (LOS) C should be used as a
      guideline to maintain for overall intersection operations. However, depending on the
      movements and volume, the City would not necessarily require mitigation
      considerations for LOS D and worse. The queuing analyses conducted as part of this
      traffic study are reported as the 95th percentile calculated length in feet. The
      calculated lengths were compared to the actual available storage length for each
      movement at the study area intersections. Mitigation measures were considered and
      evaluated for the analysis results that indicate queue lengths for turn lanes that
      exceed the available storage lengths, queues that extend back through adjacent
      intersections or queues that block access to turn lanes.

Executive Summary                                                             January 2010



  5. Traffic data was collected within the project study area on September 1, 2009. Daily
     volumes were counted along four roadways (Stadium Drive, First Street, Monterey
     Avenue and Murphy drive), while AM and PM peak hour turn movement volumes were
     counted at the following five locations:
            First Street & Stadium Drive Intersection
            First Street & Murphy Drive Intersection (including the Mullins Avenue & Pike
            Avenue approaches)
            First Street & Monterey Avenue Intersection
            First Street & Richardson Avenue Intersection
            Murphy Drive & Sunset Street/Oliver Avenue Intersection

  6. The five study area intersections are currently operating at acceptable levels during
     both the AM and PM peak hours, with the exception of the Murphy Drive southbound
     approach to First Street. This approach, and specifically the left-turn movement, is
     operating at LOS D during the AM peak hour. In addition, this southbound left-turn
     movement currently queues back past the adjacent Mullins Avenue approach at times
     during both the AM and PM peak hours. Furthermore, the eastbound and westbound
     approaches along First Street at the pedestrian signal presently queue back past the
     respective adjacent Stadium Drive and Monterey Avenue intersections at times during
     both the AM and PM peak hours.

  7. A long range no project conditions analysis, without the changes to traffic patterns
     associated with the Adams State College Campus Auxiliary Housing New Building
     project, was performed as a comparison for the with project (build) conditions. This
     analysis included the best available information for projecting the situation
     approximately 20 years into the future for the study area to the Year 2030. The
     analysis included the roadway improvements within the study area that were
     anticipated to be completed over the next 20 years, as identified by the City of
     Alamosa staff. In addition, the future volumes took into account the redistribution of
     traffic associated with those roadway improvements, as well as a growth rate to
     represent the expected future developments and general increase in population for
     the area. The analysis results indicated that the study area intersections would
     operate at the same level of service as the existing conditions with the exception of
     the Murphy Drive southbound approach to First Street. This approach is expected to
     decline by one letter grade to LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS D during the
     PM peak hour. The same queue deficiencies as for the existing conditions were
     identified for the long range no project conditions.

  8. The short-term with project conditions analysis was conducted and compared to the
     existing conditions. The same geometry and traffic control was evaluated for the short-
     term with project conditions as the existing conditions, with the exception of the two
     roadway improvements proposed with the Adams State College Campus Auxiliary
     Housing New Building project. The campus project was not anticipated to generate
     any new trips to the area. However, traffic was expected to be redistributed for both
     on-campus trips and pass through trips for the surrounding neighborhoods as a result
     of the associated roadway modifications. The operations analysis did not identify any
     changes in level of service or queuing compared to the existing conditions, with the
     exception of the First Street eastbound approach to the pedestrian signal. With the
     closing of the Stadium Drive intersection, the queue was not expected to extend back
     through the next adjacent intersection.

  9. For the long range with projects conditions, the study area intersections will continue
     to function at the same levels as identified for the long range no projects conditions,
     with the exception of the Sunset Street westbound approach to Murphy Drive. The
     level of service is expected to decline by one letter grade from the long range no
     project conditions for this approach during the AM peak hour. Furthermore, similar to
     the short-term with project conditions results, the only change in the queuing analysis
     was the First Street eastbound approach to the pedestrian signal. This approach will
     not be expected to extend through the adjacent intersection as was the case for the
     long range no project conditions.

  10. Roadway improvements were considered to mitigate the intersection operational
      deficiencies identified by the traffic analysis. The following considerations were
      evaluated regarding the deficiencies identified and potential mitigation measures.
            A cul-de-sac could be constructed for Mullins Avenue closing off the connection
            to Murphy Drive all together. However, the capacity analysis did not indicate
            any operational problems for the Mullins Avenue traffic accessing Murphy
            Drive. Furthermore, the vast majority of the low volume of traffic along Mullins
            Avenue will continue to be right-turn movements onto southbound Murphy
            Drive.
            A change in the traffic control at the First Street and Murphy Drive intersection
            could be another modification to reduce the delay and queue for the
            southbound left-turn movement. However, the City staff indicated apprehension
            to an all-way stop control at this intersection, a traffic signal would not be
            warranted based on the volumes and, while there is potentially adequate land
            to construct a roundabout, the operational deficiency for the one movement
            does not justify the cost.
            One other mitigation for the area could be to limit the movements at the First
            Street and Pike Avenue intersection or close the northbound approach all
            together. Such a change would reduce the number of conflicting movements;
            however, once again the capacity analysis does not suggest any operational
            problems specifically for this intersection.

Executive Summary                                                             January 2010


     Based on the analysis results and evaluation of alternatives, no mitigation measures
     were considered appropriate to address the Murphy Drive southbound left-turn for the
     long range no project conditions.

     The queuing analysis also identified that the First Street eastbound and westbound
     approaches to the pedestrian signal will at times develop queue that extend past the
     respective adjacent Stadium Drive and Monterey Avenue intersections. However, no
     mitigation was considered for these queues as no operational deficiencies were
     reported for the adjacent intersections.

  11. The City of Alamosa staff should consider the following recommendations for the
      project study area based on the analysis, findings and conclusions discussed in this
      report:
           The roadway improvements that have been identified by the City of Alamosa
           staff should be carried through as City funding allows. These improvements
           should include, in the order of priority: (1) a change to the Mullins Avenue
           operations to one-way eastbound traffic toward Murphy Drive to remove some
           of the conflicting movements along Murphy Drive; (2) the closing of Richardson
           Avenue between First Street and Second Street to eliminate one of the offset
           intersections along First Street; and (3) the realignment of Oliver Avenue to
           remove the offset with Sunset Street at the Murphy Drive intersection.
           The Adams State College Campus Auxiliary Housing New Building Project and
           the associated roadway changes should be allowed to proceed from a traffic
           operations standpoint. The intersection capacity and queuing analyses did not
           identify any negative changes in the operations for the future with project
           conditions compared to the existing and future no project conditions.
           Depending on the actual projects that come to fruition within the study area and
           the resulting volume growth that occurs over the next 20 plus years and the
           amount, consideration may need to be given to restricting movements at some
           point in the future. The offset intersections along First Street and angled
           approaches along the west side of Murphy Drive are not preferred designs that
           may need to be rectified as the City funding allows in the future. The Pike
           Avenue intersection with First Street would be an appropriate first candidate
           due to the proximity of the northbound approach to the First Street and Murphy
           Drive intersection.
           One potential improvement that may be appropriate to consider in order to
           improve mobility along the east side of the ASC Campus, would be the
           realignment of the connection between Stadium Drive and Monterey Avenue. A
           new alignment of the roadways in the area could potentially be developed to
           create a direct connection between Stadium Drive and Monterey Avenue
           making through traffic the primary focus. As a result, vehicles would be directed
           to continue between Stadium Drive and Monterey Avenue rather than heading
           toward a dead end along south Stadium Drive or diverting along El Rio Drive
           through the residential neighborhood to the east.

Project Overview

Adams State College (ASC) is modifying the campus in Alamosa, Colorado to add a new
housing building and enhancement of the area adjacent to Rex Field. As part of this project,
the College has proposed to vacate the portion of Stadium Drive between First Street and El
Rio Drive. Also included with this project is the relocation of some of the surface and on-
street parking to a new lot north of First Street at Faculty Drive.

Regional access to the area is provided by State Highway 160 (Main Street), which runs
east-west just south of the ASC campus. The City of Alamosa is limited in the number of
continuous roadways due to the Rio Grande River, which cuts through the area, railroad
tracks and the ASC campus. The project is proposing to vacate the section of Stadium Drive
and relocate some of the parking in order to accommodate additional on-campus housing
and create a more pedestrian friendly campus. In order to accommodate the redistribution of
traffic that is anticipated with closing Stadium Drive, Monterey Avenue is proposed to be
converted from the current one-way northbound operation between First Street and El Rio
Drive to allowing two-way traffic for the full length of the roadway.

Purpose of Report

The purpose of this study is to review, assess and identify potential traffic related impacts
that the proposed ASC Campus Auxiliary Housing New Building project may have on the
transportation network and recommend mitigation to minimize these impacts where
necessary and possible. Exhibit 1 shows the general vicinity of the project in the City of
Alamosa. The changes being proposed as part of the ASC Campus project have been
provided as Exhibit 2. The key features proposed as part of the project that could impact
transportation operations include the vacation of Stadium Drive and the relocation of parking
to a new lot along the north side of First Street.

The City of Alamosa staff has indicated that a Traffic Impact Study (TIS) is required to be
submitted to evaluate the potential impact of closing Stadium Drive to traffic in the area. The
assumptions utilized in conducting the traffic analysis are based on direction received from
City of Alamosa staff via a scoping meeting on August 26, 2009, as documented in the
meeting notes prepared by Martin/Martin dated August 31, 2009. In addition, subsequent e-
mail correspondence and phone discussions with Don Koskelin, the Assistant City Manager
and Public Works Director, were conducted to further refine the assumptions.

This report includes an evaluation and assessment of the study area for the existing
conditions, short-term conditions and the long range conditions. The short-term conditions
represent the near-term immediately after the completion of the ASC Campus Auxiliary
Housing New Building project, which is expected to be completed next year (Year 2010). The
long range conditions considered both the potential impact of any planned changes within

the study area and those proposed as part of the ASC Campus project, approximately 20
years into the future (Year 2030).

Study Conditions

Study Area
The project study area for the TIS was determined in the traffic scoping discussion with the
City of Alamosa staff. As a result, the report includes an evaluation of Stadium Drive and the
roadways immediately adjacent to the ASC Campus to where the diverted traffic would be
anticipated to redistribute: Monterey Avenue, First Street, Murphy Drive and Sunset Street.
Consequently, the following five intersections were evaluated and included in the analysis:
   1. First Street & Stadium Drive Intersection
   2. First Street & Murphy Drive Intersection (including the Mullins Avenue & Pike Avenue
      approaches)
   3. First Street & Monterey Avenue Intersection
   4. First Street & Richardson Avenue Intersection
   5. Murphy Drive & Sunset Street/Oliver Avenue Intersection
Each of these intersections currently has unsignalized traffic control with the side street stop
controlled and no control on the major street.

Analysis Horizons
The following four conditions were analyzed as part of this study during both the AM and PM
peak hours, with the corresponding volume and network configurations as indicated:
   1. Existing Conditions
      Analysis of the existing conditions at the study area intersections were based on the
      turning movement volumes collected when classes were in Fall session on the ASC
      campus in September of 2009 and the intersection geometry and traffic control as
      observed in the field.
   2. Short-Term with Project Conditions
      Analysis of the short-term future conditions was conducted to evaluate the operations
      in the near-term that will be present with the completion of the ASC Campus project.
      With Stadium Drive expected to be vacated sometime in the next year, the analysis of
      this condition was intended to represent the volumes and roadway network for the
      Year 2010. The only roadway improvements presumed to be completed for the short-
      term condition were the closing of Stadium Drive between First Street and El Rio Drive
      and Monterey Avenue being changed to two-way operation between First Street and
      El Rio Drive. The volumes were developed to represent this short-term condition by
      predicting a growth in the existing volumes over the next year and adding the
      redistributed trips related to both on-campus traffic and Alamosa through traffic within
      the study area.

Introduction                                                                       January 2010


       A short-term no project condition was not evaluated as the operations were expected
       to be very similar to the existing conditions. The ASC Campus project was expected to
       be completed in the next year and aside form the changes included with the project,
       no specific roadway improvements have been identified for the immediate future. In
       addition, no other projects were identified in the study area that might impact the
       forecast volumes. Therefore, with the near-term expected to be such a short distance
       into the future, the existing conditions were utilized as a base comparison rather than
       conducting a short-term no project condition analysis.
   3. Long Range No Project Conditions
       The long range conditions included the best available information for projecting the
       situation approximately 20 years into the future for the study area to the Year 2030. A
       long range no project condition analysis, without the proposed Stadium Drive closure
       and associated traffic pattern changes, was performed as a comparison for the with
       project (build) condition. This analysis did include the roadway improvements within
       the study area that are anticipated to be completed over the next 20 years, as
       identified by the City of Alamosa staff. The long range no project conditions volumes
       were calculated by applying a growth rate to the roadway network and applying 21
       years of the background growth to the existing volumes along the study area
       roadways, representing the expected future developments and general increase in
       population for the area.
   4. Long Range With Project Conditions
       The long range future year analysis included the same roadway geometry as for the
       long range no project conditions with two exceptions. Stadium Drive was assumed to
       be vacated between First Street and El Rio Drive and Monterey Avenue was
       presumed to be changed to a two-way roadway between First Street and El Rio Drive.
       The forecast volumes were calculated by combining the long range no project
       volumes with redistributed trips related to both ASC on-campus traffic and Alamosa
       through traffic as a result of these project roadway modifications.

Analysis Methodology

The analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the procedures in
the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) and as described below. The analysis and procedures
conducted are based upon the worst case conditions that occur during a typical weekday.
Therefore, most of each weekday and the weekends will experience traffic conditions better
than those described within this document, which represent the peak hours of operation only.

Level of Service (LOS) is an empirical premise developed by the transportation profession to
quantify driver perception for such elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of
stopped delay, and impediments caused by other vehicles afforded to drivers who utilize the
transportation network. LOS has been defined by the Transportation Research Board in the
2000 Highway Capacity Manual. This document has quantified level of service into a range
from "A" which indicates little, if any, vehicle delay, to "F" which indicates significant vehicle

Introduction                                                                                     January 2010


delay and traffic congestion that may lead to system breakdown due to volumes that may far
exceed capacity.

The calculation of level of service at both signalized and unsignalized intersections are
examined in the Transportation Research Board's 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. The
Highway Capacity Manual defines the level of service for a signalized intersection as the
average delay per vehicle (amount of time a vehicle must spend at the intersection) for the
overall intersection. For unsignalized intersections that include both stop-controlled and
uncontrolled approaches (known as through/stop controlled), the Highway Capacity Manual
defines the level of service as the average delay per vehicle for the worst approach, not the
overall intersection.

As discussed in the previous section, all of the study area intersections are unsignalized.
Therefore, level of service letter grades as defined by the Transportation Research Board
and the associated amount of delay in seconds per vehicle, as well as a brief description of
the operating condition, only for unsignalized intersections are included for reference in
Table 1.

According to the City of Alamosa staff, a level of service C should be used as a guideline to
maintain for overall intersection operations. However, depending on the movements and
volume, the City would not necessarily require mitigation considerations for LOS D and
worse.

The queuing analyses conducted as part of this traffic study are reported as the 95th
percentile calculated length in feet. The analysis was conducted by transferring the model
developed in Synchro to the compatible SimTraffic simulation software. The calculated
lengths were then compared to the actual available storage length for each movement at the
study area intersections. Mitigation measures were considered and evaluated for the
analysis results that indicate queue lengths for turn lanes that exceed the available storage
lengths, queues that extend back through adjacent intersections or queues that block access
to turn lanes.

                     EXISTING CONDITIONS

The purpose of this section is to document the existing conditions within the study area for
the proposed ASC Campus project. The aerial photography and roadway images were
obtained via the Internet from Google Maps or from photos taken in the field.

Roadway Conditions

The following is a list of the surrounding streets, their functional classification, and general
geometry.

Stadium Drive is a north-south collector roadway that
extends approximately one-half of a mile between First
Street and Carroll Street running along the east side of the
ASC campus and providing access to the Alamosa
neighborhood immediately to the north of ASC. Currently,
parking is allowed along both sides of the two-lane
roadway and the signed speed limit on campus is 20 miles
per hour (mph).

First Street is an east-west arterial roadway that extends
approximately 1.5 miles and runs through the ASC
campus, providing an alternative to SH 160 (Main Street)
through Alamosa. The two-lane roadway is intersected by
a series of offset side-street roadways and provides a
center left-turn lane at intersections and driveways. The
only traffic signal within the study area is a pedestrian
crossing located along First Street between Stadium Drive
and Monterey Avenue. On-street parking is allowed in
some designated area and the roadway is signed at 30 mph within the project study area.

Murphy Drive is a north-south collector roadway that
extends approximately two-thirds of a mile between First
Street and Carroll Street. The wide, two-lane roadway
allows on-street parking along both sides of the street and
is intersected by a series of angled roadways from the
west.

Monterey Avenue is a two-block long, one-way
northbound roadway between First Street and El Rio Drive.
ASC Campus buildings are along the west side of the road
and residential single family homes are along the east
side, both accommodated by on-street parking. The two-
lane roadway is signed at 20 mph.

Sunset Street is a three-block long, east-west
roadway along the north side of the ASC Campus
between Stadium Drive and Murphy Drive. The two-
lane, local roadway allows on-street parking on both
sides of the street and has no posted speed.

Study Area Intersections

The project study area intersections were identified through a scoping discussion with the
City of Alamosa staff. The study encompasses five intersections, which are illustrated in
Exhibit 3 and described as follows.

First Street and Stadium Drive currently intersect

shared through/right-turn lane for the westbound           N
approach and a through and left-turn lane for the
eastbound     approach.     The     Stadium      Drive                                                 First St

stop controlled northbound approach only slightly
offset 50-feet to the east and Mullins Avenue
angles at 45 degrees into Murphy Drive creating
an additional eastbound approach 60-feet to the
north. This results in three very closely spaced

lane and a right-turn lane. The eastbound
approach along First Street includes a shared
through/left-turn lane at Murphy Drive and then a
shared through/right-turn lane at Pike Avenue.
The Murphy Drive southbound approach has a shared through/right-turn lane at Mullins
Avenue and both a left-turn lane and a right-turn lane at First Street. Mullins Avenue provides
a single lane for the eastbound approach to Murphy Drive and Pike Avenue a single lane for
the northbound approach to First Street. Stop control is provided for the eastbound Mullins
Avenue approach to Murphy Drive, the Pike Avenue northbound approach to First Street and
the Murphy Drive southbound approach to First Street.

First Street and Monterey Avenue meet at a three-legged unsignalized intersection.
Monterey Avenue is one-way northbound away from the intersection, so there is currently no
southbound approach. The east-west oriented First

intersection, the northbound approach provides
separate left-turn and right-turn lanes that are stop
controlled. With no access allowed onto Richardson         N
Avenue, both of the First Street approaches provide only a single through lane.

Together Murphy Drive and Sunset Street/Oliver Avenue
form a four-legged unsignalized intersection with the two east-
west streets slightly offset from one another. Oliver Avenue
approaches Murphy Drive at approximately a 45 degree angle. Oliver                       Sunset St

Traffic Volumes

Traffic volumes were collected by All Traffic Data Services, Inc. under the direction of
Martin/Martin. Daily volumes were collected on Tuesday, September 1, 2009 within the
project study area along Stadium Drive north of First Street (3,700), First Street east of
Faculty Drive (8,800), Monterey Avenue north of First Street (600) and Murphy Drive north of
Mullins Avenue (4,400). An additional day of data was collected at the First Street location on
Wednesday, September 2, 2009 to identify any substantial changes as a result of the local
public schools scheduled early dismissal; however, the data identified no discernable
difference between the two days of counts. Roadway morning (7:00 ­ 9:00 AM) and
afternoon (4:00 ­ 6:00 PM) peak period traffic volumes were collected on Tuesday,
September 1, 2009 at the five study area intersections.

The daily and peak hour volumes from these counts are shown in Exhibit 4. The raw count
data is provided in the Technical Appendix.

Intersection Capacity Analysis

The existing levels of service at the subject intersections were calculated applying the
methods from the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, as implemented in Synchro, Version 7 to
the existing volumes, geometry and traffic control shown in Exhibits 3 and 4. The existing
levels of service for the intersections within the study area are summarized in the following
Table 2. The table reports worst approach level of service and delay in seconds per vehicle
for each of the unsignalized intersections.

According to the City of Alamosa, a level of service C should be used as a guideline to
maintain for overall intersection operations. All of the existing study area intersections are
currently operating at acceptable levels during both the AM and PM peak hours with the
exception of the Murphy Drive southbound approach to First Street. During the AM peak hour
this approach, and specifically the left-turn movement, is operating at LOS D. The level of
service calculations for the existing conditions are provided in the Technical Appendix.

Queuing Analysis

In addition to the capacity analysis, the queue results were reviewed to determine if the
vehicle stacking along the approaches to the study area intersections extend back to
adjacent intersections. The queues were also evaluated to determine if vehicle stacking is
expected to extend out of turn lane storage lengths or if the through lane queues would be
expected to block access to turn lanes. The results indicated that the existing queue for the
southbound left-turn on Murphy Drive at First Street extends past the Mullins Avenue
approach at times during both the AM and PM peak hours. The pedestrian signal along First
Street between Stadium Drive and Monterey Avenue was also evaluated. Both the
eastbound and westbound vehicle queues along First Street extend back through the
adjacent intersection at times during the AM and PM peak hours. None of the other study
area intersections were found to have any existing queuing deficiencies. The queuing results
for the existing conditions are provided in the Technical Appendix.

       FUTURE NO PROJECT CONDITIONS

With the project expected to be completed in the next year, the near-term analysis is
expected to be such a short distance into the future that the existing conditions were utilized
as a base comparison rather than conducting a short-term no project condition analysis.
However, a long range no project conditions analysis, without the proposed ASC Campus
Auxiliary Housing New Building project Stadium Drive vacation and relocation of parking and
the associated redistribution of traffic, was performed as a comparison to the with project
(build) condition.

Geometry & Traffic Control

Over the next 20 years, three roadway improvements were anticipated to be completed
within the study area.
   1. The Oliver Avenue eastbound approach to the Murphy Drive and Sunset Street/Oliver
      Avenue intersection was presumed to be modified to align with Sunset Street. This
      change would eliminate the offset through the intersection.
   2. The Mullins Avenue eastbound approach to Murphy Drive was also presumed to be
      modified to operate as a one-way eastbound roadway. This change would eliminate
      the northbound left-turn movement from Murphy Drive so close to the First Street
      intersection, requiring vehicles to instead either use First Street or another access
      along Murphy Drive to the north.
   3. Richardson Avenue was presumed to be vacated for one block between First Street
      and Second Street. This change would eliminate one of the offset intersections along
      First Street and result in the vehicles previously using the northbound approach along
      Richardson Avenue to find an alternate route to access First Street.
      The portion of Richardson Avenue between First Street and Second Street, which is
      planned to be closed as part of a separate project, is one-way northbound in this
      segment. A majority of the traffic utilizing this roadway are Adams State College
      campus-related trips. After closure of this portion of the street, trips are anticipated to
      reduce usage of Richardson Avenue for non-campus purposes. Instead, these trips
      will likely utilize other north-south options in the vicinity, such as Edgemont Boulevard
      and Poncha Avenue, to access First Street. Some traffic will continue to use
      Richardson Avenue south of Second Street for on-campus purposes. While no traffic
      counts were collected on Poncha Avenue or Edgemont Boulevard for this study, it is
      not anticipated that the closure of this segment of Richardson Avenue will degrade
      these adjacent roadways to a point requiring mitigation.

The roadway improvements assumed for the future no project conditions are shown in
Exhibit 5.

Volumes

The only potential development or land use changes that were identified that could
potentially affect the project study area were the closing of Evans Elementary, future
expansion of the San Luis Valley Regional Medical Center campus, and future modifications
to the ASC Campus.
      Evans Elementary, currently located approximately ¼ mile to the east of the study
      area along the south side of First Street, is planned to be closed within the next year.
      The counts conducted along First Street at the beginning of September 2009 showed
      a negligible difference between typical weekday traffic volumes and when the school
      had an early dismissal time. Furthermore, any future use of the property would be
      expected to be of similar land use characteristics and not anticipated to be a high
      generator of traffic. Therefore, no significant change to the peak hour volumes was
      anticipated as a result of the future Evans Elementary School closing.
      The San Luis Valley Regional Medical Center campus, located adjacent to ASC on
      the south side of First Street, is anticipated to continue to expand and grow in the
      future. However, as documented in the previous traffic study conducted for the
      medical center back in 2002, any growth is expected to be gradual and steady, while
      the majority of the medical center's traffic is directed to/from SH 160 (Main Street).
      Presently, the only proposed improvements on the ASC Campus, other than those
      related to the currently planned Auxiliary Housing New Building project, are minor
      additions. With the exception of potentially additional parking for the portion of campus
      south of First Street, the other potential future plans are either minor or event based
      traffic generators and not expected to result in any noticeable peak hour changes in
      demand. Furthermore, the ASC staff indicated that little to no growth in on-campus
      student enrollment is anticipated for the next several years, with the long-term
      unpredictable at this time. However, over the past decade the student enrollment has
      stagnated having approached the capacity for on-campus residents and class
      attendance.

The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) conducts regular daily traffic counts
every couple of years on roadways included in their system. Reportedly, such counts were
recently conducted in the Summer of 2009 along First Street. However, no CDOT count data
was able to be obtained for First Street. Consequently, the only other historical volume data
available in the vicinity of the study area was found to be CDOT counts along SH 160 (Main
Street). Looking at counts from the Year 2000 to the Year 2008, the data showed a slight
decline in volume for the area. Consequently, the application of a modest average annual
growth rate to each of the study area roadways and for each of the study area intersection
movements was determined to be a reasonable approach for developing background growth
over the next 20 years.

As a result, with the proposed project located in a built-out area and the only potential future
projects in the area as described above and accountable by a minimal background growth
rate, an average annual growth rate of 0.5 percent was proposed and applied.

Future No Project Conditions                                                  January 2010


In addition, the planned roadway improvements to Oliver Avenue, Mullins Avenue and
Richardson Avenue were expected to result in some redistribution of the background traffic.
      The Oliver Avenue eastbound approach alignment with Sunset Street will result in
      more direct and clear movements through the intersection with Murphy Drive.
      The change in traffic operations on Mullins Avenue to allowing eastbound traffic only
      to Murphy Drive will result in the traffic presently accessing Mullins Avenue from
      Murphy Drive to use an alternative route. The southbound Murphy Drive traffic was
      assumed to either turn on to a roadway prior to arriving at Mullins Avenue or to
      continue along Murphy Drive to First Street before proceeding to the west. Similarly,
      for the northbound Murphy Drive left-turn traffic desiring to access Mullins Avenue, a
      majority of the traffic was assumed to use First Street to the west of Murphy Drive,
      while the remaining trips were directed to another access along Murphy Drive north of
      Mullins Avenue.
      With the closing of Richardson Avenue between First Street and Second Street, the
      previous northbound left and right-turn movements onto First Street were redistributed
      as westbound and eastbound through movements, respectively.

The resulting redistributed background trips associated with the presumed roadway
improvements are shown by study area intersection turn movement in Exhibit 6.

The long range no projects condition volumes were calculated by first redistributing the
existing (Year 2009) volumes to address the assumed roadway improvements and then
applying 21 years of background growth representing the expected future (Year 2030)
developments and general increase in population for the area. The resulting Year 2030
projected peak hour volumes are shown in Exhibit 7.

Intersection Capacity Analysis

The level of service calculations for the no project condition were based on the study area
roadway network and future volumes described above. Table 3 shows the anticipated level
of service and delay at the study area intersections.

The level of service is expected to decline by one letter grade from the existing conditions
during both the AM and PM peak hour operations for the Murphy Drive southbound approach
to First Street. The resulting long range no project condition operations for the approach are
LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS D in the PM peak hour. All of the other study area
intersections were reported at LOS C or better for this future condition.

The level of service calculations for the long range no projects conditions are provided in the
Technical Appendix.

Queuing Analysis

The queuing analysis for the long range no project conditions indicated the potential for
vehicle stacking impacting the traffic operations. The results identified that the Murphy Drive
southbound left-turn movement at First Street will be expected to continue to extend back
through the Mullins Avenue approach at times during the AM and PM peak hours. In
addition, the eastbound and westbound queues along First Street at the pedestrian signal will
continue to extend back through the adjacent intersection at times during both the AM and
PM peak hours. None of the other study area intersections were reported to have any
queuing deficiencies.

The queuing results for the long range no projects conditions are provided in the Technical
Appendix.

Mitigation

The only deficiency anticipated within the study area for the long range no project conditions
were reported along the Murphy Drive southbound approach to First Street. The approach
and, more specifically, the left-turn movement was reported to operate at LOS E during the
AM peak hour and LOS D during the PM peak hour. In addition, the left-turn queue will be
expected to extend back and block access from Mullins Avenue at times during both the AM
and PM peak hours. However, in developed urban areas it is not uncommon to have minor
street turn movements onto arterial roadways operating at LOS D or E during peak
conditions.

With Mullins Avenue already presumed to be changed to a one-way eastbound operation,
the southbound right-turn and northbound left-turn movements along Murphy Drive will have
been eliminated. Other potential roadway improvements that were considered included the
following:
             A cul-de-sac could be constructed for Mullins Avenue closing off the connection
             to Murphy Drive all together. However, the capacity analysis did not indicate
             any operational problems for the Mullins Avenue traffic accessing Murphy
             Drive. Furthermore, the vast majority of the low volume of traffic along Mullins
             Avenue will continue to be right-turn movements onto southbound Murphy
             Drive.
             A change in the traffic control at the First Street and Murphy Drive intersection
             could be another modification to reduce the delay and queue for the
             southbound left-turn movement. However, the City staff indicated apprehension
             to an all-way stop control at this intersection, a traffic signal would not be
             warranted based on the volumes and, while there is potentially adequate land
             to construct a roundabout, the operational deficiency for the one movement
             does not justify the cost.
             One other mitigation for the area could be to limit the movements at the First
             Street and Pike Avenue intersection or close the northbound approach all
             together. Such a change would reduce the number of conflicting movements;
             however, once again the capacity analysis does not suggest any operational
             problems specifically for this intersection.

Based on the analysis results and evaluation of alternatives, no mitigation measures were
considered appropriate to address the Murphy Drive southbound left-turn for the long range
no project conditions.

The queuing analysis also identified that the First Street eastbound and westbound
approaches to the pedestrian signal will at times develop queue that extend past the
respective adjacent Stadium Drive and Monterey Avenue intersections. However, no
mitigation was considered for these queues as no operational deficiencies were reported for
the adjacent intersections.




                  Adams State College Stadium Drive Vacation Traffic Impact Study         24
      PROPOSED PROJECT INFORMATION

Adams State College is planning to add a new housing building and enhancement of the
area adjacent to Rex Field on their Alamosa campus. As part of this project, the College has
proposed to vacate the portion of Stadium Drive between First Street and El Rio Drive and
relocate some of the surface and on-street parking to a new lot north of First Street at Faculty
Drive. The proposed modifications for the project were previously shown in Exhibit 2.

Project Geometry

In addition to the planned roadway improvements identified as part of the future no project
conditions, there are two additional changes within the study area proposed as part of the
ASC Campus project. First, Stadium Drive will be closed to traffic between First Street and El
Rio Drive. The newly aligned segment of roadway will accommodate pedestrians and
emergency vehicles, as necessary, only. Second, the operation along the two-block long
Monterey Avenue between First Street and El Rio Drive will be changed from a one-way
northbound roadway to allowing two-way traffic. In order for this to be possible, a design
option will need to be developed that accommodates any on-street parking that is necessary
to be maintained along Monterey Avenue and either continued access for truck delivery to
the Student Services Center or an alternative solution.

Trip Redistribution

While the proposed ASC Campus project was not anticipated to generate any new trips to
the area, the proposed roadway modifications were expected to result in a redistribution of
traffic. In determining the expected traffic patterns after the closing of Stadium Drive and
change in operation to two-way traffic on Monterey Avenue, the following matters were taken
into consideration in order to properly redistribute traffic.
         The trips currently using Stadium Drive were divided into two categories: ASC campus
         oriented trips and pass through trips to/from the surrounding Alamosa neighborhoods.
         A distinction as to how many of each type were currently using Stadium Drive was
         determined.
         The current traffic using Stadium Drive had the option of travelling either to/from the
         east or the west along First Street. The amount of traffic oriented to each direction
         along First Street and the number of trips associated with campus trips versus pass
         through trips were identified.
         The relocation of parking as part of the ASC Campus project had to be factored into
         the redistribution for the on-campus traffic.
         The appropriate alternative routes that the traffic could divert around the vacated
         Stadium Drive had to be determined.
         If there was any traffic congestion found within the study area, the affect on
         redistributed traffic had to be taken into account.

Proposed Project Information                                                     January 2010


Based on discussions with City of Alamosa and ASC staff, traffic currently using Stadium
Drive was determined to be split fairly evenly between drivers accessing the ASC campus
and drivers using Stadium Drive as a pass through to access the neighborhoods to the
northwest. Therefore, an even 50/50 division was used for the existing trips on Stadium Drive
oriented to/from the east along First Street. However, the existing trips on Stadium Drive that
are oriented to/from the west on First Street were determined to be more likely to be campus
trips. More neighborhood (non-ASC) trips were assumed to currently utilize Murphy Drive to
bypass the ASC campus. As a result, a 75/25 split was used for the existing Stadium Drive
traffic oriented to/from the west on First Street, with more campus trips than pass through
trips assumed.

For the redistribution of on-campus trips, traffic routes took into consideration the preferred
areas of destination. With the relocation of
parking on the ASC Campus as a result of the
Auxiliary Housing New Building project and
closure of Stadium Drive, the campus trips
oriented to/from the east along First Street
were determined to divert with approximately
one-third continuing on First Street to the new
parking lot and the other two-thirds using
Monterey Avenue. The campus trips oriented
to/from the west along First Avenue were
expected to divert with approximately one-
third using Murphy Drive to Sunset Street,
one-third accessing the new parking lot along
the north side of First Street at Faculty Drive
and the remaining one-third using the
presumed two-way Monterey Avenue.

                                              For the pass through trips, the redistribution for
                                              traffic oriented to/from the east along First
                                              Street was similar to those of on-campus
                                              traffic. The pass through traffic was assumed
                                              to redistribute with approximately one-third
                                              continuing on First Street to Murphy Drive and
                                              north past Sunset Street, with the other two-
                                              thirds using Monterey Avenue. However, for
                                              those pass through trips oriented to/from the
                                              west, the vast majority were assumed would
                                              utilize Murphy Drive to bypass the ASC
                                              Campus with the vacation of Stadium Drive.

Trip Assignment

The redistribution of on-campus and pass-through trips associated with the vacation of
Stadium Drive and the change to two-way traffic operation along Monterey Avenue were
assigned to the roadway network as described in the previous section.

The resulting project-related redistribution of traffic by intersection turn movement during

Exhibit 8 .Project-Related Redistributed Trips
     FUTURE WITH PROJECT CONDITIONS

This section documents the analysis conducted for both the future short-term and long range
conditions that included the ASC Campus Auxiliary Housing New Building project. Analysis
of the short-term future conditions was conducted to evaluate the operations in the near-term
that will be present with the completion of the ASC Campus project. The analysis of this
condition was intended to represent the volumes and roadway network to be present upon
completion of the project, which is anticipated to be the Year 2010. The short-term conditions
were compared to the existing conditions to determine the potential impact of the project on
the study area roadway system traffic operations.

The long range future year analysis was conducted and compared to the future no project
conditions to determine the potential impact of the ASC Campus project to the study area
roadway network. The long range represented any roadway improvements and the forecast
volumes for the Year 2030 conditions.

Geometry & Traffic Control

The same geometry and traffic control was evaluated for the short-term with project
conditions as the existing conditions and for the long range with project conditions as the
long range no project conditions, with the exception of the two roadway improvements
proposed with the ASC Campus project as discussed in the previous chapter.

The future geometry and traffic control, including the project-related roadway improvements
for the future with project conditions, are shown in Exhibit 5.

Volumes

Future volumes were developed for the short-term and long range with project conditions.
The short-term with projects condition volumes were calculated by applying the growth rate
to the existing condition volumes for one year and then combining the resulting background
traffic with the redistribution of trips associated with the closing of Stadium Drive and change
to two-way traffic operations on Monterey Avenue. The resulting short-term with project
conditions volumes are shown in Exhibit 9.

The long range with project condition volumes were calculated by combining the long range
no projects condition volumes with the redistributed trips associated with the closing of
Stadium Drive and change to two-way traffic operations on Monterey Avenue. The long
range with project condition volumes are illustrated in Exhibit 10.

Intersection Capacity Analysis

The future with project intersection capacity analyses were conducted for both the short-term
and long range conditions.

Short-Term Conditions

The level of service calculations for the short-term with project conditions were based on the
study area roadway network and future volumes. Table 4 shows the anticipated level of
service and delay at the study area intersections during the AM and PM peak hours.

The level of service is not expected to decline at any of the study area intersections from the
existing conditions during either the AM or the PM peak hours. However, the Murphy Drive
southbound left-turn movement at First Street is expected to continue to operate at LOS D
during the AM peak hour.

The level of service calculations for the short-term with project conditions are provided in the
Technical Appendix.

Long Range Conditions

The level of service calculations for the long range with project conditions were based on the
study area roadway network and future volumes described above. Table 5 shows the
anticipated level of service and delay at the study area intersections during the AM and PM
peak hours.

The level of service is expected to decline by one letter grade from the long range no project
conditions for the Sunset Street westbound approach to Murphy Drive during the AM peak
hour. The level of service is not expected to change at any of the other study area
intersections. The Murphy Drive southbound left-turn movement at First Street is expected to
continue to operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS D during the PM peak hour.

The level of service calculations for the long range with project conditions are provided in the
Technical Appendix.

Queuing Analysis

The short-term and long range with project conditions queuing analyses were also both
conducted.

The queuing analysis for the short-term with project conditions indicated the potential for
vehicle stacking at the same locations as for the existing conditions. The left-turn movement
along the Murphy Drive southbound approach to First Street will be expected to continue to
extend back past the Mullins Avenue approach at times during both the AM and PM peak
hours. However, while the First Street westbound approach queue at the pedestrian signal
will be expected to continue to extend back past the Monterey Avenue intersection at times
during the AM and PM peak hours, the eastbound approach queue will not be expected to
extend back to the adjacent intersection. The reason for this change from the existing
conditions was the removal of the Stadium Drive intersection for the with project condition.
None of the other study area intersections were reported to have any queuing deficiencies.

The queuing analysis for the long range with project conditions indicated the potential for
vehicle stacking impacting the traffic operations similar to the long range no project
conditions. The left-turn movement along the Murphy Drive southbound approach to First
Street will be expected to continue to extend back past the Mullins Avenue approach at times
during both the AM and PM peak hours. As with the short-term condition results, while the

Future With Project Conditions                                                  January 2010


First Street westbound approach queue at the pedestrian signal will be expected to continue
to extend back past the Monterey Avenue intersection at times during the AM and PM peak
hours, the eastbound approach queue will not be expected to extend back to the adjacent
intersection. None of the other study area intersections were reported to have any queuing
deficiencies.

The queuing results for the short-term and long range with project conditions are provided in
the Technical Appendix.

Mitigation

The same operational deficiencies identified for the existing conditions were expected to
continue to occur for the short-term with project conditions. Similarly, the same operational
deficiencies identified for the long range no project conditions were expected to continue to
occur for the long range with project conditions. The one exception for both comparisons was
that, with the removal of the Stadium Drive intersection with First Street as part of the ASC
Campus Auxiliary Housing New Building project, the queue along the First Street eastbound
approach will not be expected to extend back through the adjacent intersection.
Consequently, with no mitigation measures identified for the existing and long range no
project conditions, likewise none are recommended for the short-term or long range with
project conditions.

However, one potential improvement that may be appropriate to consider in order to improve
mobility along the east side of the ASC Campus, would be the realignment of the connection
between Stadium Drive and Monterey Avenue. The existing connection requires multiple 90-
degree turns along a stretch of El Rio Drive with on-street parking on both sides of the
roadway. A new alignment of the roadways in the area could potentially be developed to
create a direct connection between Stadium Drive and Monterey Avenue making through
traffic the primary focus. As a result, vehicles would be directed to continue between Stadium
Drive and Monterey Avenue rather than heading toward a dead end along south Stadium
Drive or diverting along El Rio Drive through the residential neighborhood to the east. Such a
realignment could potentially be accomplished by reassigning adjacent land uses, utilizing
more gentle curves for the roadway connection, and creating more distinctive T-intersections
for the south leg of Stadium Drive and the east leg of El Rio Drive.

        SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONS

Based upon the analysis, field observations, data collected, assumptions, methodologies and
results which are provided in the body of this document, minimal mitigation has been
identified to accommodate the redistributed traffic expected as a result of the roadway
improvements identified for the ASC Campus Auxiliary Housing New Building project. The
operational analysis results for the various conditions evaluated are summarized below and
in Table 6.

In summary, the following findings are documented in this report.

Existing Conditions
      All of the existing study area intersections are currently operating at acceptable levels
      during both the AM and PM peak hours with the exception of the Murphy Drive
      southbound approach to First Street. During the AM peak hour this approach, and
      specifically the left-turn movement, is operating at LOS D.
      The existing queue for the southbound left-turn on Murphy Drive at First Street
      extends past the Mullins Avenue approach at times during both the AM and PM peak
      hours. In addition, both the eastbound and westbound approach vehicle queues along
      First Street at the pedestrian signal extend back through the adjacent intersections at
      times during the AM and PM peak hours. None of the other study area intersections
      were found to have any existing queuing deficiencies.

Long Range No Project Conditions
      The level of service is expected to decline by one letter grade from the existing
      conditions during both the AM and PM peak hour operations for the Murphy Drive
      southbound approach to First Street. The resulting long range no project condition
      operations for the approach are LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS D in the PM
      peak hour. All of the other study area intersections were reported at LOS C or better
      for this future condition.
      The queuing analysis results identified that the Murphy Drive southbound left-turn
      movement at First Street will be expected to continue to extend back through the
      Mullins Avenue approach at times during the AM and PM peak hours. In addition, the
      eastbound and westbound queues along First Street at the pedestrian signal will
      continue to extend back through the adjacent intersection at times during both the AM
      and PM peak hours. None of the other study area intersections were reported to have
      any queuing deficiencies.

Summary & Recommendations                                                       January 2010



      With Mullins Avenue already presumed to be changed to a one-way eastbound
      operation, the southbound right-turn and northbound left-turn movements along
      Murphy Drive will have been eliminated. Other potential roadway improvements that
      were considered included the following:
            A cul-de-sac could be constructed for Mullins Avenue closing off the connection
            to Murphy Drive all together. However, the capacity analysis did not indicate
            any operational problems for the Mullins Avenue traffic accessing Murphy
            Drive. Furthermore, the vast majority of the low volume of traffic along Mullins
            Avenue will continue to be right-turn movements onto southbound Murphy
            Drive.
            A change in the traffic control at the First Street and Murphy Drive intersection
            could be another modification to reduce the delay and queue for the
            southbound left-turn movement. However, the City staff indicated apprehension
            to an all-way stop control at this intersection, a traffic signal would not be
            warranted based on the volumes and, while there is potentially adequate land
            to construct a roundabout, the operational deficiency for the one movement
            does not justify the cost.
            One other mitigation for the area could be to limit the movements at the First
            Street and Pike Avenue intersection or close the northbound approach all
            together. Such a change would reduce the number of conflicting movements;
            however, once again the capacity analysis does not suggest any operational
            problems specifically for this intersection.

      Based on the analysis results and evaluation of alternatives, no mitigation measures
      were considered appropriate to address the Murphy Drive southbound left-turn for the
      long range no project conditions.

      The queuing analysis also identified that the First Street eastbound and westbound
      approaches to the pedestrian signal will at times develop queue that extend past the
      respective adjacent Stadium Drive and Monterey Avenue intersections. However, no
      mitigation was considered for these queues as no operational deficiencies were
      reported for the adjacent intersections.

Short-Term with Project Conditions
      The level of service is not expected to decline at any of the study area intersections
      from the existing conditions during either the AM or the PM peak hours. However, the
      Murphy Drive southbound left-turn movement at First Street is expected to continue to
      operate at LOS D during the AM peak hour.
      The queuing analysis for the short-term with project conditions indicated the potential
      for vehicle stacking at the same locations as for the existing conditions. The left-turn
      movement along the Murphy Drive southbound approach to First Street will be
      expected to continue to extend back past the Mullins Avenue approach at times during
      both the AM and PM peak hours. However, while the First Street westbound approach

     queue at the pedestrian signal will be expected to continue to extend back past the
     Monterey Avenue intersection at times during the AM and PM peak hours, the
     eastbound approach queue will not be expected to extend back to the adjacent
     intersection. The reason for this change from the existing conditions was the removal
     of the Stadium Drive intersection for the with project condition. None of the other study
     area intersections were reported to have any queuing deficiencies.
     The same operational deficiencies identified for the existing conditions were expected
     to continue to occur for the short-term with project conditions. The one exception was
     that, with the removal of the Stadium Drive intersection with First Street as part of the
     ASC Campus Auxiliary Housing New Building project, the queue along the First Street
     eastbound approach will not be expected to extend back through the adjacent
     intersection. Consequently, no mitigation measures were identified for the short-term
     with project conditions.

Long Range with Project Conditions
     The level of service is expected to decline by one letter grade from the long range no
     project conditions for the Sunset Street westbound approach to Murphy Drive during
     the AM peak hour. The level of service is not expected to change at any of the other
     study area intersections. The Murphy Drive southbound left-turn movement at First
     Street is expected to continue to operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS
     D during the PM peak hour.
     The queuing analysis for the long range with project conditions indicated the potential
     for vehicle stacking impacting the traffic operations similar to the long range no project
     conditions. The left-turn movement along the Murphy Drive southbound approach to
     First Street will be expected to continue to extend back past the Mullins Avenue
     approach at times during both the AM and PM peak hours. As with the short-term
     condition results, while the First Street westbound approach queue at the pedestrian
     signal will be expected to continue to extend back past the Monterey Avenue
     intersection at times during the AM and PM peak hours, the eastbound approach
     queue will not be expected to extend back to the adjacent intersection. None of the
     other study area intersections were reported to have any queuing deficiencies.
     The same operational deficiencies identified for the long range no project conditions
     were expected to continue to occur for the long range with project conditions. The one
     exception was that, with the removal of the Stadium Drive intersection with First Street
     as part of the ASC Campus Auxiliary Housing New Building project, the queue along
     the First Street eastbound approach will not be expected to extend back through the
     adjacent intersection. Consequently, with no mitigation measures identified for the
     long range no project conditions, likewise none are recommended for the long range
     with project conditions.

Recommendations
Our recommendation to the City of Alamosa staff based on the traffic analysis and findings in
this report include the following:
      The roadway improvements that have been identified by the City of Alamosa staff
      should be carried through as City funding allows. These improvements should include,
      in the order of priority: (1) a change to the Mullins Avenue operations to one-way
      eastbound traffic toward Murphy Drive to remove some of the conflicting movements
      along Murphy Drive; (2) the closing of Richardson Avenue between First Street and
      Second Street to eliminate one of the offset intersections along First Street; and (3)
      the realignment of Oliver Avenue to remove the offset with Sunset Street at the
      Murphy Drive intersection.
      The Adams State College Campus Auxiliary Housing New Building Project and the
      associated roadway changes should be allowed to proceed from a traffic operations
      standpoint. The intersection capacity and queuing analyses did not identify any
      negative changes in the operations for the future with project conditions compared to
      the existing and future no project conditions.
      Depending on the actual projects that come to fruition within the study area and the
      resulting volume growth that occurs over the next 20 plus years and the amount,
      consideration may need to be given to restricting movements at some point in the
      future. The offset intersections along First Street and angled approaches along the
      west side of Murphy Drive are not preferred designs that may need to be rectified as
      the City funding allows in the future. The Pike Avenue intersection with First Street
      would be an appropriate first candidate due to the proximity of the northbound
      approach to the First Street and Murphy Drive intersection.
      One potential improvement that may be appropriate to consider in order to improve
      mobility along the east side of the ASC Campus, would be the realignment of the
      connection between Stadium Drive and Monterey Avenue. A new alignment of the
      roadways in the area could potentially be developed to create a direct connection
      between Stadium Drive and Monterey Avenue making through traffic the primary
      focus. As a result, vehicles would be directed to continue between Stadium Drive and
      Monterey Avenue rather than heading toward a dead end along south Stadium Drive
      or diverting along El Rio Drive through the residential neighborhood to the east.

 RECOMMENDATION:

 It is recommended that the City Council conduct the third Study Session on the Update of the
 General Plan, receive a presentation of technical studies, and approve the proposed draft land
 use designations.


 SUMMARY:

 This is the third Study Session for the General Plan Update. The objective of this session is to
 provide the City Council with a presentation of the Fiscal Capacity Report; the Infrastructure
 Report; the Existing Transportation Setting and Conditions Report; and hold discussions with
 the City Council on any refinement of the proposed Land Use designations so the draft
 General Plan can be prepared.


 BACKGROUND:

 The Community Development Department is pursuing the decennial update of the La Palma
 General Plan, which was last updated in March of 1999. The General Plan is a guide for
 future decisions with respect to land use, development, and related policy matters. To do that,
 it contains goals and policies that provide guidance to City Officials, City Staff, and the
 Community. The goals describe general conditions that are desired and the policies provide a
 framework for how to achieve those goals.

 The La Palma General Plan includes the seven (7) mandated Elements required by State law
 and an additional Element to comply with Orange County's Measure M. The 1999 General
 Plan was structured in the consolidated format with the eight elements divided up under four
 general chapters, which are: The City Structure, Community Safety, Housing, and Growth
 Management. The first two chapters contain most of the topics (or elements, as the
 Government Code refers to them) specified in State law. Housing is treated separately
General Plan Update
June 5, 2012

because its scope is specified in great detail in the law. The Growth Management chapter
likewise covers a single subject because of the specifications of Measure M.

The goal for this General Plan update was to use the existing General Plan Goals and Policies
as a base for policy development, augmenting these with any new changes resulting from
public outreach, emerging issues, and to address new State laws (including AB 32, AB 1358,
AB162, and SB 375). The Community also needs to confront several current and future
challenges in this update. Some of these challenges include the loss of redevelopment as a
financing tool for public infrastructure; lack of diversity in its revenue base; aging
commercial, industrial, and residential properties; shifting demographics; maintenance and
modernization of public facilities and equipment; and dealing with regional issues.


ANALYSIS:

At the second City Council General Plan Workshop that was held on April 17, 2012, the City
Council was provided with a market study, proposed Land Use designations, and a draft land
use map. At that meeting it was noted that additional studies were forthcoming, which included
fiscal capacity analysis and infrastructure assessment reports. It was determined that before the
City Council would approve a draft Land Use Plan that it was the City Council's request to have
all of the studies before them for review and discourse with the public.

Fiscal Capacity Report: A fiscal analysis was prepared by Hogle-Ireland based on the market
study and the draft land use plan and is included as Attachment 1 to this report. The Fiscal
Capacity Analysis component of the Strategy will include the following:
      A review of recurring municipal revenues and expenditures;
      Determination of capital improvement financing capacity;
      Future public service delivery capacity;
      Maintenance of public facilities assessment;
      Capacity for funding economic development initiatives; and
      Recommended initiatives to grow the City's/Agency's fiscal capability.

Infrastructure Report: An infrastructure analysis was prepared by Hogle-Ireland and is
included as Attachment 2 to this report. Adequate public infrastructure is an essential element
of successful economic development and the ability to support projected land use demands.
Without adequate public infrastructure, economic development faces challenges because the
systems may not be able to support the demands of new or intensified land uses. That is why
it is typical for economic development strategies to include the development and prioritization
of prerequisite area-benefitting backbone infrastructure, the absence of which would otherwise
be considered an impediment to planned and desirable development. The Infrastructure
Background Report includes an evaluation of the adequacy and capability of the backbone
infrastructure located within or of benefit to the City's economic development target area. This
General Plan Update
June 5, 2012
Page 3 of 5

report examines water        storage   and   distribution,   sewage   collection,   drainage   and
communications facilities.

Existing Transportation Setting and Conditions Report: An existing conditions traffic
analysis was prepared by Traffic and Circulation Report Team mobility expert Iteris. The
report examines current operating conditions on City streets and intersections. The report is
included as Attachment 3 to this report. Existing 2011 peak hour and average daily traffic
volumes were collected and analyzed in this traffic impact analysis for the update of the City of
La Palma General Plan. The analysis covers all of the City's key transportation elements,
including roadways, transit services, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities within the community.

Using roadway link and intersection volumes, Iteris calculated levels of service on City arterials
and at five intersections. Data from the City of La Palma and the Orange County Master Plan
of Arterial Highways (MPAH) document were used to develop current link volumes. The study
established the existing conditions which will be the foundation from which all planning and
mitigation for land use changes is built upon with the General Plan Update. Future conditions
will be analyzed once the draft Land Use Plan is confirmed by the City Council.

Draft Land Use Designations: In the updated General Plan, new land uses can be integrated
to create a better balance between residential and non-residential land uses to achieve more
robust property and retail sales taxes. The proposed draft Land Use designations responds by
providing the opportunity for the City of La Palma to improve its presence along the 91 freeway
corridor in terms of visual appearance, intensity of development, and a range of uses that
attracts spending on a regional scale. Also, a new town center along Walker Street and better
utilized commercial properties can create places for retail and service uses that meet the day-
to-day needs of local residents who now spend their money in adjacent communities. By
providing better local places to shop, the City can achieve two key goals: 1) building the tax
base and 2) allowing people to walk and bike to local businesses, which works toward
sustainability objectives. These objectives and the proposed designations were reviewed with
the City Council at the April 17, 2012 study session.

Three new Mixed Use land use designations, described in Attachment 4 and shown on the
draft map provided as Attachment 5, are proposed to achieve these goals. The Mixed Use
designations will provide flexibility for property owners and will, through higher intensity
standards (floor-area ratio, or FAR) than exist today, induce private reinvestment and
establishment of new uses.

Tables 1 and 2 below summarize the ultimate development yields that could result from the
long-term application of the proposed new land use designations. It should be noted that while
the proposed General Plan would allow for a significant increase in non-residential building
square footage, the majority of that would occur in the Mixed Use focus areas, and especially
in the Mixed Use ­ Freeway District area, which would represent 83 percent of the proposed
growth (see Table 2). Similarly, the proposed increase in dwelling units would occur primarily
in the Mixed Use - Freeway District and the Town Center, where residential uses would be
introduced through the new mixed-use land use categories.

CONCLUSIONS:

At this time, it is necessary for the City Council to review and consider approval of the
proposed Land Use designations and draft Land Use Map so that the General Plan update
process can continue to move forward. The proposed Land Use designations and Map
provides the framework necessary for the preparation of a draft Updated General Plan. Staff
and Hogle-Ireland will incorporate the City Council's direction and return later this year with a
Draft General Plan for further consideration. Once a draft Updated General Plan is agreed
upon the Environmental Review in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) of the plan is conducted.


NOTIFICATION:

To encourage participation from the public, an advertisement was placed in the May 23 and
May 30 editions of the News Enterprise. Announcement of the workshop has been posted on
the City's electronic reader board. Additionally, a tri-fold color mailer was sent to stakeholders
who participated in the outreach interview process, property owners of sites under
consideration for new land use designations, and residents adjacent to those sites. In all,
approximately 500 direct mailers were distributed for this Study Session.

                                                        Fiscal Capacity Background Report



I.           Purpose
The purpose of this background report is to review the existing (2012) fiscal
capacity of the City of La Palma, project future fiscal capacity, identify potential
economic development funding capacity and identify possible economic
development initiatives.

This report reviews six areas dealing with the City's fiscal condition:

     1.   Recurring municipal revenues and expenditures
     2.   Capital improvement financing capacity
     3.   Future public service delivery capacity
     4.   Maintenance of public facilities assessment
     5.   Capacity for funding economic development initiatives
     6.   Potential initiatives to grow the City's fiscal capacity



II.          Challenges
This analysis comes at a time of major challenges for cities throughout California,
including the City of La Palma. From a broad economic perspective, the City has
experienced a massive recession which has significantly reduced both local
property tax and sales tax revenues, along with other sources of income. While
there are indications the economic climate is improving, it is beyond the scope of
this study to make any projections about the broader economic conditions on a
regional, state, national or international level. Therefore, this report focuses on
the known and the potential that exists within the community and the immediate
market region of La Palma.

Specifically, the City is faced with several challenges as it updates the General
Plan.

          The City is virtually built out. While a few vacant sites and several
          underutilized sites exist, the City does not have the potential for significant
          new development or growth outside of creating opportunities to intensify
          existing development.

          Since 2007, increasing in late 2008 and early 2009, and continuing until the
          present, the City's property tax base has eroded as the value of property
          has decreased.

          The national economic conditions have significantly reduced sales tax
          revenues to the City, and the reduction may continue if large and small
          sales tax generators close and/or consolidate operations outside of La
          Palma.

          In the 2011 legislative session, the State Legislature adopted legislation
          which eliminated local redevelopment agencies.          While there was


La Palma General Plan Update ­ Fiscal Analysis                                              Page 1
Fiscal Capacity Background Report


         companion legislation to allow each redevelopment agency to continue to
         function if that agency shared its local revenues with the State, in
         December 2011 the State Supreme Court upheld the legislation terminating
         the redevelopment agencies but held the companion legislation allowing
         continued functioning as unconstitutional. This has ended a significant
         source of funding for the City.

         The State of California continues to grapple with its own budget deficit,
         which has implications for the ability of cities to depend on State resources
         for funding. While the State will be seeking ballot approval for increased
         revenues at the November 2012 General Election, the City cannot depend on
         the approval of these revenues. Even if the revenues are approved by the
         voters, the State will continue to face fiscal challenges.

While a General Plan is not a fiscal document nor does it set fiscal policy -- and
while its recommendations must be based on broad community needs, the City's
vision and land uses which reflect current market and planning considerations --
updating a General Plan can put in place long-term land use policies that can
either exacerbate or help resolve on-going fiscal issues.



III.        Recurring Municipal Revenues and Expenditures
A.       General Fund
The City's budget is the primary source document for analyzing La Palma's
recurring municipal revenues and expenditures. The budget reflects the policies
of the current City Council, as well as anticipates subsequent years of revenues
and expenditures. In addition to the budget, the City Finance Department also
maintains an analysis projecting revenues and expenditures through FY 2029-30,
although any projection beyond the first few years is speculative at best and is
appropriately based on very conservative growth factors being applied. The
current volatility of the economy, the loss of redevelopment funding and the
uncertain tax base for the City also impact any long-term projections.

The City Council is currently considering the budget for FY 2012-13, based upon
anticipated revenues and expenditures currently being projected.

In the proposed budget, the City Council anticipates total General Fund revenues
of $9,707,600 and total general fund expenditures of $9,644,200, as shown in
Table 1.

                   Total                                 $9,644,200

As Table 1 indicates, the City has three major sources of revenue: property tax,
sales tax and utility users tax.

1.    Property Taxes
Like all other agencies which depend on property tax, the City has experienced a
substantial decline in these revenues since 2008 because of the significant loss in
value for all forms of real estate caused by the economic downturn. Since FY
2010-11, however, the property tax revenues have stabilized. As shown in the
proposed 2012-13 budget, actual receipts in FY 2010-11 were $2,926,867,
projected receipts for FY 2011-12 are $2,965,000 and proposed receipts for FY
2012-13 are $2,920,200. As broader economic conditions improve, property
values for both residential and commercial properties are also expected to
improve, and these revenues will increase accordingly.

Additionally, the City has a large number of properties which continue to have
assessed values based on those established in 1978 with the passage of
Proposition 13.

Table 2 includes data provided by the City and shows the impact on property tax
revenues of those properties which remain with a Proposition 13-based assessed
value. Over the 20 to 25 year time period to be covered by the General Plan, it can
be expected that many of these properties will be sold, triggering reassessment
to then-market values and providing a commensurate increase in property tax
revenues to the City.

Furthermore, the Market Study for the General Plan Update identifies several
locations where property values can be significantly increased by allowing for
higher density housing, higher floor-area ratios and privately initiated
redevelopment to more productive land uses. These changes will also strengthen
the City's property tax base.

2.       Sales Tax
Table 3 details the percent of total sales tax received by the City in 2011 by
industry category. While the City's sales tax base is strong, it is highly dependent
on sales tax generated from fuel and service stations, which represents 80.97
percent of the City's total sales tax.

                           Table 3: Percent of Sales Tax by Source

                                                   Fiscal Capacity Background Report


Over-reliance on a single industry for sales tax is a concern for the City. Just as
the Market Study for the General Plan Update identifies potential sites for
strengthening property values, it also details a number of sales categories in
which the City is losing sales tax to surrounding jurisdictions because La Palma
lacks the retail outlets to provide residents an opportunity to shop locally. The
General Plan Update provides an opportunity for the City to change land uses and
policies for targeted sites to help capture this lost sales tax revenue. This will
strengthen the City's sales tax base and reduce its over-reliance on a single
source of sales tax as revenue to the General Fund.

3.    Utility Users' Tax
The City has a utility users' tax which applies a 5 percent tax to the cost of
utilities paid by residents and businesses within the City. The code establishing
the rate requires the City Council to set the rate annually. For the last several
years, including FY 2012-13, the City Council has chosen to lower the rate, setting
it at 4 percent.

Draft General Plan policy which has been the subject of City Council workshops
during 2012 includes a proposal to allow for mixed-use development within three
target areas: along the State Route 91 freeway, at the City center along Walker
Avenue and at a site on Valley Boulevard. Higher-density housing and increased
intensity of commercial and, professional office uses, in addition to hospitality
uses (hotels and entertainment), have the potential to provide for more utility
customers within the City, thus increasing the utility users tax revenues to help
meet future City needs without requiring a increase in the utility users tax above
the 4 percent applied to date. In the future, as an alternative to increasing
development intensities and expanding the base of users paying the utility tax,
the Council could increase revenues to meet service needs by raising the tax rate
to five percent. Other methods of funding services over the long term are
discussed later in this report.

B.    Elimination of Redevelopment
As part of its 2011-12 budgetary actions, the State adopted legislation to
eliminate local redevelopment agencies but also adopted legislation that would
have allowed local agencies to continue to function if each agreed to a greater
share of its revenues with the State. After consideration of a lawsuit against the
state's actions, in December, 2011, the State Supreme Court held the latter to be
unconstitutional, leaving only the legislation eliminating redevelopment in place.

La Palma's redevelopment agency, the Community Development Commission
(CDC), was a major source of funding for both capital projects and affordable
housing within the then-existing redevelopment project areas. This funding has
now been lost. There are numerous legislative proposals being considered in
Sacramento to replace the affordable housing function, the economic development
function or both with some type of local authority, but no action has yet been
taken on any of these.



La Palma General Plan Update ­ Fiscal Analysis                                         Page 5
Fiscal Capacity Background Report




As part of its response to the termination of redevelopment activity, the City of La
Palma has chosen to name itself "Successor Agency" for both the general assets
as well as the affordable housing assets of the CDC. While these assets have
been transferred to the City, use of them is subject to the provisions of the State
legislation, regulations being issued by the State and authorization of the
"Oversight Board," which includes representatives from various property taxing
agencies which had jurisdiction in the former project areas.

The result of the demise of redevelopment is that La Palma lost $4,856,300 in FY
2011-12 and similar anticipated amounts in future fiscal years. While this money
was legally required to be spent in Redevelopment Project Areas, the economic,
development, housing and infrastructure activities which would have taken place
in those areas will now either no longer be possible or will need to be financed by
other sources.

Not all of the redevelopment monies lost, however, had been used for on-going
CSC operations. Approximately 50 percent of the tax increment was pledged to
service the bonded indebtedness of the CDC. These funds will continue to be
available to retire this and other debt the CDC had incurred.

Certain administrative funds are available to the City as it unwinds the CDC.
Under the State legislation and regulations for the unwinding of the
redevelopment agencies, a Successor Agency is allowed to retain either three
percent of the property tax allocated to it or $250,000, whichever is greater. In an
April 27, 2012 letter to the City from the State Department of Finance (DOF), DOF
estimated that the three percent would total $12,208. DOF therefore concluded
that the City of La Palma, as Successor Agency, will receive $250,000 per year to
cover administrative expenses.



IV.       Capital Improvement Financing Capacity
The City of La Palma maintains a capital projects reserve fund to finance on-going
capital projects and to maintain an adequate emergency reserve in the event the
City must draw on it. The City also sets aside a portion of revenues from both its
sewer and water fees to finance water and sewer capital projects.

Drawing from these sources and from a variety of others, the City implements its
annual Capital Improvement Program, or CIP. Table 4 outlines the revenues
proposed for the FY 2012-13 and shows the projected future revenues through FY
2016-17.

Of the revenues shown in Table 4, only those from the Capital Outlay Reserve and
Facilities Maintenance can be used for general capital projects. The Gas Tax and
Measure M funds are restricted to streets, highways and transportation capital
projects, and the sewer and water funds are restricted to those two functions,
respectively.

Table 5 details the projected expenditures by type from Fiscal Year 2012-13
through FY 2016-17, as outlined in the proposed FY 2012-13 budget.

The Infrastructure Background Report prepared for the General Plan Update does
not indicate any major anticipated infrastructure improvements. The City's
infrastructure is fully constructed, and the City performs on-going maintenance
and repairs through its current CIP program. The loss of CDC funding will impact
capital projects within the former redevelopment project areas which the City will
need to fund from other sources. However, both the sewer and water funds are
generated from their own revenues sources and therefore, on-going sufficient
revenues can be anticipated.

A comparison of Table 4 (Revenues) with Table 5 (Expenditures) clearly shows
that the City's focus for its general capital projects revenues is on the street
system. The loss of the CDC funds which had previously been allocated to these
programs will reduce the City's ability to make these improvements.



La Palma General Plan Update ­ Fiscal Analysis                                                        Page 7
Fiscal Capacity Background Report


Further, the City's Capital Outlay Reserves -- as well as its facilities maintenance
funding -- come from General Fund allocations. If future disruptions to General
Fund revenues occur, as the City has experienced in the past few years because of
the economic downturn or some other occurrence, future capital expenditures will
be affected.

For sewer and water capital projects, both will continue to be funded through the
sewer and water fees the City collects, a portion of which are allocated to capital
improvements and maintenance. Specifically with respect to sewers, the City is
currently updating the Sewer Master Plan (see General Plan Infrastructure
Background Report). In order to meet any needs that may be identified in this
new Master Plan, sewer fees may need to be adjusted to ensure appropriate long-
term revenues. Water fees may also be similarly adjusted as the City's needs for
its water infrastructure are identified.

This analysis does not include the City's need for additional parkland or its ability
to maintain the parklands that exist today. Table 5 (Capital Expenditures) clearly
shows that, with the exception of FY 2012-13 and FY 2013-14, no funds are
proposed to be allocated for capital projects needed to maintain or improve the
condition of Central Park and the pocket parks, much less broader park
enhancement. However, on-going non-capital maintenance expenses are funded
through the General Fund. Without additional revenue sources or grant monies,
the City's inability to provide capital funds for its parks will create an on-going
funding challenge.



V.        Future Public Service Delivery Capacity
The City's public services are funded through the General Fund. While there are
some offsets for administration and similar expenditures from the two enterprise
funds (water and sewer), these offsets are limited to the level of activity of the
City's general management team needed to administer these two operations and
do not reflect significant transfers into the General Fund.

Table 6 reports the General Fund revenues in the currently proposed budget for
FY 2012-13, as well as the expected revenues the City's current financial analysis
anticipates for the subsequent three fiscal years, through FY 2015-16. While
included for FY 2012-13, the DOF projected Successor Agency Administration
funding has not been added for the subsequent three years since final
discussions continue with the DOF on the amount of money which will be
available for the activities of the Successor Agency in those years.

Any projection beyond FY 2015-16 is speculative at best and has not been
included.

As can be seen, the City anticipates revenues to remain relatively stable with no
significant increase expected. These projections were prepared absent increased
revenues that could result from land use intensification.

Expenditures for the City's public services come almost exclusively from the
General Fund. Similar to Table 6, Table 7 shows projected expenditures in the
proposed City budget for FY 2012-13 and the City's internal financial forecasts for
the subsequent three fiscal years.

VI.           Maintenance of Public Facilities Assessment
The City funds day-to-day maintenance of public facilities through the General
Fund. As noted in Table 6, the City can anticipate maintaining current day-to-day
maintenance efforts unless there is a significant reduction in General Fund



La Palma General Plan Update ­ Fiscal Analysis                                                 Page 9
Fiscal Capacity Background Report


revenues. If there is such a reduction, the City Council will need to determine the
priority of such maintenance when compared to other funding priorities.

The issue becomes problematic, however, when considering capital expenditures
which may be needed for more significant public facilities maintenance. While the
previous discussion concerning capital projects shows that maintenance of the
sewer and water facilities can be continued due to the dedicated revenues for
each of these functions, the General Fund allocation for public facility
maintenance is restricted.

Maintenance of streets and intersections also has specific revenue sources:
Measure M and Gas Tax. A reduction in revenues for circulation improvements
has resulted due to the loss of CDC funding,

However, Table 5, shows that in the proposed budget minimal expenditures are
planned for maintenance of other public facilities. In FY 2012-13, only $170,000
was allocated ($70,000 for parks and $100,00 for City Hall). The only other fiscal
year showing projected expenditures is FY 2013-14. Subsequent fiscal years show
no projected expenditures.

If revenues increase with an economic upturn or another occurrence, the City
Council may decide to allocate some of the additional revenues to maintenance of
City facilities.   But without a revenue increase, the City continues to face
difficulties in public facilities maintenance both because of maintenance deferred
as well as future maintenance needs arising.



VII.      Capacity for Funding Economic Development
          Initiatives
The loss of the CDC with associated revenues and powers creates a major gap in
the City's capacity to fund economic development activities. The following
discussion dealing with recommended initiatives to grow the City's fiscal capacity
identifies possible actions the City can take to expend revenues and strengthen
its fiscal capacity. However, unless different approaches and programs than the
City has previously considered are explored and adopted, the City will have
limited capacity to aggressively pursue economic development initiatives.

The City, however, is not without the ability to aggressively pursue attracting new
development and tax-generating users through cooperation with the private
sector. The tools available, though, are not ones the City has been accustomed to
using, and the creation of new tools needs to be considered.

Because of the impacts of the economic downturn, the City has the opportunity to
develop a cooperative, working relationship with private property owners in the
City who have seen their vacancies rise and thus the value of their properties
diminish. These property owners are seeking new and stronger tenants to serve
the La Palma marketplace. As the City and the region emerge from the economic

                                                        Fiscal Capacity Background Report


downturn, potential users and tenants will be seeking locations where they can
expand and grow.

For many potential tax-generating users, a cooperative regulatory environment is
a significant advantage.        For existing property owners seeking to expand,
rehabilitate, revitalize or intensify their properties, the same is true.

The market study prepared for the General Plan Update shows that the City is not
capturing its appropriate share of retail sales. While La Palma's population may
not be expected to grow significantly, new opportunities for La Palma residents to
spend within the City exist. Table 8 is replicated from Figure I-3 in the Market
Study detailing the potential for retail anchors.

In addition, the market study indicates a strong potential exists in the lodging
industry for hotel operations, the potential expanding over the next eight years.
This will enhance the City's ability to increase transient occupancy taxes beyond
those it now receives. Table 9 shows the information provided in the Market Study
Figure I-6 addressing the lodging industry in the City.

                                                                             Market

The market study further identified possible sites where significant
intensification of existing development is possible. These include the existing La
Palma Community Hospital Intercommunity Hospital, Centerpointe and two
industrial sites totaling 20+ acres immediately west of Centerpointe.

While the City may no longer have the economic development capacity that it had
with the CDC, it can, nonetheless, work closely with the property owners
throughout the community to attract those businesses which the market study

Fiscal Capacity Background Report


has identified as having potential within the community. Further, the City can
adopt land use and regulatory policies which encourage property owners to
revitalize and, where possible, intensify development opportunities.

Including those mentioned above, the market study identified 20 opportunity site
locations in La Palma. They are shown in Exhibit 1, as well as in Exhibit V-1 in the
market study.

               Exhibit 1: City of La Palma Opportunity Site Locations




Page 12                                  La Palma General Plan Update ­ Fiscal Analysis
                                                   Fiscal Capacity Background Report


The City's primary economic development strategy involves a proactive approach
to working with the private sector in revitalizing, rehabilitating and intensifying
uses, as well as coordinating efforts to attract those users for which market
potential exists. The General Plan Update can provide the appropriate policy
direction that will result in revised regulatory statutes to accomplish this.

At the same time, when a development is proposed, even without redevelopment
authority, the City has the capacity to provide focused financial and development
assistance through existing state enabling legislation. Among these are:

      Development Agreements

      State law enables the City to enter into development agreements with
      property owners and developers to assist in the development of their
      property.    Development agreements allow the City to provide direct
      incentives to developers in the development of their property through a
      variety of tax sharing mechanisms. They also provide for a "freezing" of
      development regulations as of the date of the development agreement for
      the term of the development agreement, thus protecting developers from
      changes in fees, regulations and other mandates over the life of the
      agreement.

      Specific Plans

      While not appropriate for smaller developments, the City has the capability
      of developing specific plans for larger developments. These specific plans
      become the primary land use regulatory documents for the areas covered
      by the specific plan. As such, they can be used to provide unique
      regulatory incentives, such as increases in density or floor-area ratios or
      other alternative regulations that might not be provided city-wide through
      standard zoning regulations.

      Such incentivized land use regulations can directly benefit property owners
      and developers by significantly adding to the investment potential of their
      properties. In return, the City's general fund receives the additional tax
      revenues which are generated by the new development.

      Parking Authorities/Districts

      Parking districts can be especially beneficial to the development and/or
      redevelopment of property. Through a parking authority, the City can issue
      bonds to buy the parking area from a property owner/developer, thus
      providing a financial infusion to the property owner, and then use the
      bonds to develop the parking itself. This can be especially beneficial to the
      developer where structured or underground parking is needed to allow
      more intense development because of the high cost of constructing such
      parking. The developer/property owner then leases the parking from the
      parking authority for the cost of the annual bond debt service.




La Palma General Plan Update ­ Fiscal Analysis                                         Page 13
Fiscal Capacity Background Report


      Based on the draft recommendations for the General Plan Update, this
      strategy might be particularly appropriate within the Centerpointe area or
      the proposed Town Center.

      Business Improvement Districts (BID) and Property Business Improvement
      Districts (PBID)

      Business Improvement Districts and Property Business Improvement
      Districts are focused types of assessment districts which can be valuable in
      assisting property owners accomplish improvements and business
      development within a cohesive area. However, unlike other assessment
      districts, a BID (assessments made through the business license tax) or a
      PBID (assessments through the business license tax on businesses and the
      property tax on property owners) are operated by the stakeholders involved
      in creating the district. The City annually approves the district's budget
      and sets and then collects the assessment, but the BID/PBID Board
      implements the activities.

      The activities are also different from the typical assessment districts, which
      are primarily used for the construction of infrastructure. The activities
      which can be funded by a BID/PBID are aimed at enhancing the business
      atmosphere within the district and include such things as cleaning the
      rights-of-way, removal of trash, providing parking and transportation
      services, special lighting and/or landscaping, graffiti removal, marketing
      and promotion and other similar activities. However, these may not replace
      the services the City typically provides throughout the rest of the
      community.

      Non-Profit Development Entities ­ Lease-Revenue Bonds

      Beginning in the late 1980s, school districts, community college districts,
      the state university systems and some special districts created non-profit
      development entities to develop needed facilities for which they had no
      available financing. Often these entities took the form of foundations.
      Through these non-profit entities, the public agencies could issue lease-
      revenue bonds for development projects which they could not otherwise
      afford or might be legally prevented from developing. The public agency or
      some other private entity would then lease the project from the non-profit
      to cover the debt service on the bonds.

      While the City cannot legally develop private property, a City-created non-
      profit corporation can. The non-profit corporation can also participate with
      a developer in a development sharing lease and other revenues the
      development generates to offset the bind payments.

      It should be noted that the two state university systems have used this
      mechanism very effectively in developing student housing. Some cities and
      former redevelopment agencies have also used this technique. This same
      template could be used to assist the City in developing affordable as well
      as higher density market rate housing.


Page 14                                  La Palma General Plan Update ­ Fiscal Analysis
                                                    Fiscal Capacity Background Report




With the loss of redevelopment authority, the City of La Palma can continue to
coordinate with the private sector in the development and redevelopment of
property. However, it will need to become more creative in how it does so and
consider options it may not have considered in the past.



VIII. Potential Incentives to Grow the City's Fiscal
      Capacity
As with all cities in California, La Palma faces challenges to finance both the on-
going provision of public services as well as its capacity to provide for capital
funding for its infrastructure and maintenance of public facilities. This latter will
become more important over the years as the infrastructure ages and there is an
increasing cost for repair and potential needed replacement.

A.    Provision of Public Services
The City of La Palma finances its public services primarily through its general
fund revenues. These revenues come primarily through property, sales and utility
user taxes. Therefore, in order to grow its fiscal capacity for public services, the
City must grow its tax base.

There are no quick fixes for this. Any short-term potential to quickly improve this
situation has limited possibility within a fully developed city. However, as noted
in the Market Study for the General Plan Update, both short-term and long-term
opportunities are available to attract revenue generators.          The economic
downturn has also created opportunities to work with existing property owners
who are faced with vacancies and/or underpriced lease space.

To this end, the City can immediately reach out to these property owners and
begin cooperating with them as they seek to lease out vacant space or to find
more profitable leases for underpriced space as it current leases expire. Using
the findings of the market study, as well as meeting directly with potential users
in cooperation with the property owners, the City can have a short-term, even if
limited, effect on the tax revenues being generated locally.

Over the long term, the City's fiscal capacity to provide on-going public services
can be significantly enhanced through the types of actions noted in Section VI
above, dealing with economic development incentives.          By allowing for an
intensification of development opportunities, specifically where such potential
exists along the freeway in the north and arterial highways throughout the City,
and by assisting such development utilizing tools it may not have used before,
the City can provide for long-term growth in its general fund revenue base, thus
providing for a significantly enhanced fiscal capacity for providing on-going
public services.

Fiscal Capacity Background Report



B.      Provision of Capital Improvements
The City has responsibility for a variety of infrastructure systems for which it has
and will need capital improvements, costs which cannot be born through the
General Fund. Among these systems are sewers, water, streets and parks.

The City's sewer and water systems are financed as enterprise funds, with
dedicated revenue sources of their own. Through the setting of fees and costs for
these two services, the City can effectively cover potential capital needs.

Streets and highways also have dedicated revenue sources, but the City does not
control the level of funding which comes from these. Gas tax funds can be used
throughout the City on both the residential as well as arterial systems. Measure
M funds are allocated primarily to encourage and assist the City in providing
street and transportation systems which coordinate with larger regional need.
This limits the use of Measure M funds to the major arterials in the City and
transportation systems serving regional needs.

Additional local capacity is needed for the circulation infrastructure, especially as
it ages. Increased general fund revenues through intensified development and
new tax-generating uses can assist this, since the City funds a portion of its
capital needs through its capital improvement reserve fund, which is replenished
by drawing from the general fund.

The City can consider a variety of financing but traditional techniques which it
has not been accustomed to using. Among these traditional techniques are
assessment districts and/or tax districts.

        Assessment and Tax Districts

        While primarily used by newer, growing cities, assessment and tax districts
        can provide alternative financing courses for developers and property
        owners for the installation of upgraded and/or new public infrastructure,
        including sewers, water, streets, curbs, gutters sidewalks, landscaping,
        lighting and a variety of other improvements. While the assessments
        and/or special taxes must be paid by the property owner, the public bonds
        and other financing mechanisms used by the City through the districts can
        offset initial development costs, allowing the property owner or developer
        to pay for these improvements over time and not have to capitalize their
        costs in their development financing.

        Infrastructure Financing Districts

        A tool that is available to the City for new infrastructure is an Infrastructure
        Financing District, (IFD), although many cities have been reticent to use this
        authority because of the difficulty in establishing an IFD.

        State law (Government Code §53395 et seq.) allows for the formation of
        IFDs. These districts obtain their revenues through tax increment, similar to


Page 16                                      La Palma General Plan Update ­ Fiscal Analysis
                                                     Fiscal Capacity Background Report


      the method previous used by redevelopment agencies. The tax increment
      can be captured for a period of 30 years. The law provides for a broad
      array of types of infrastructure to be developed, including financing
      highways, transit, water systems, sewer projects, flood control, child care
      facilities, libraries, parks and solid waste facilities. However, IFDs cannot
      pay for maintenance, repairs, operating costs and services.

      Forming an IFD is cumbersome. The City must develop an infrastructure
      plan, send copies to every landowner in the proposed district, consult with
      other local governments and hold a public hearing. Every local agency that
      will contribute its property tax increment revenue to the IFD must approve
      the plan, although schools cannot shift their property tax increment
      revenues to the IFD.

      Once the other local officials approve, the City must still get the affected
      voters' approval to:

          ·   Form the IFD (requires 2/3 voter approval).
          ·   Issue bonds (requires 2/3 voter approval).
          ·   Set the IFD's appropriations limit (majority voter approval).

      The use of this tool for financing new infrastructure can be difficult. But if
      the IFD is focused on areas which need the new infrastructure and the City
      is able to get the approval of the affected voters approve, this can be a
      significant tool for significant infrastructure which may be needed for new
      development within the City.

      Parcel/Per Unit Taxes

      A financing technique being increasingly used by public agencies is a
      parcel tax or per unit tax. Requiring a vote of the people being taxed, most
      successful parcel taxes ensure that the revenues generated are dedicated to
      specific uses and/or needs.

      Park Financing

      Of specific concern to the City is the lack of park funds for on-going
      maintenance and upgrading of existing parks and possible expansion of the
      City's park system. The capital financing techniques above can be used for
      park capital improvements.

      In addition to them, however, is the potential to form a city-wide park
      special district. Through such a special district, the park system would
      create its own tax base as well, as be able to issue notes and bonds for
      major capital projects. Further, the park district could generate funds for
      the on-going operation and maintenance of the parks as well as park
      activities and the personnel and other expenses currently being charged to
      the General Fund. This would benefit not only the park and recreation

      facilities and services of the City, but also free up needed general fund
      revenues for other priority projects.



IX.       Conclusion
The City of La Palma faces numerous financial and fiscal challenges for the future.
Its current revenue base is limited by the fact the City is virtually fully developed.
Redevelopment has been eliminated as a viable funding source for development
and improvements. Easy options are limited, as they are for most cities that are
fully developed in throughout California.

There are a variety of steps which can be taken, few of which are uncontroversial.
Several of the options outlined in this report are politically volatile and several
require approval by the voters and/or property owners affected, including
assessment and tax districts, parcel taxes and the creation of special districts.
Where such assessments/taxes are limited to developers and/or property owners
seeking them, voter approval is relatively simple since only those directly affected
need vote.    Where such techniques are to be applied to larger areas, to
neighborhoods or city-wide, such voter approval becomes more problematic.

The various policies adopted in any general plan must be based on factors
beyond just fiscal ones. However, updating a general plan provides opportunities
to increase the tax base by allowing for land use policies which incentivize and
encourage new development and more intensified development in specific areas
of the City. This Fiscal Capacity Background has prepared for the General Plan
Update to further analysis, public discussions and debate regarding fiscal issues
as the City considers all factors to be addressed in the updated General Plan.

I. Purpose 
This background report evaluates existing infrastructure systems in the City of
La Palma to identify capacity and possible deficiencies in the current system.
This broad analysis is intended to determine whether General Plan land use
policy may have the potential to impact current or planned systems to the
extent that improvements may be needed over the long term to meet growth
demands. The systems examined water storage and distribution, sewage
collection, regional drainage, and communications facilities.



II. Water 
Domestic water service for virtually all customers in La Palma is provided by the
City's Public Works Department, Water Division. The exception is a few water
service connections provided by the Golden State Water Company (GSWC), which
provides domestic water service to Walker Jr. High School and John F. Kennedy
High School. The City also provides water to approximately 388 residents in the
City of Cerritos, as identified in the 2010 Urban Water Management Plan.

Water Supply 
The City completed its most recent Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) in
2010. The UWMP identifies adequate water resources through year 2035,
assuming a maximum population equivalent of 156.7 gallons per capita per day
(GPCD) with a target of 146.2 GPCD in 2015 and 135.8 GPCD in 2020.

Water is provided through a combination of pumped groundwater from the
Orange County Water Basin and water from the State Water Project. As of 2010,
65% of the City's water supply was provided by well/groundwater and 35% by
State Water Project resources through the Municipal Water District of Orange
County (MWDOC).

The Orange County Water Basin is regulated by the Orange County Water District
(OCWD). John Kennedy, Assistant General Manager of the OCWD, has stated
that the groundwater basin is in "very good shape" due to the rains received
from the 2010 winter season. As a result of the increased amount of water
availability in the Orange County Water Basin, the percentage each jurisdiction is
allowed to pump in accordance with total water need will be increased by 3%,
from 65% to 68%, currently above the 65% pumped by the City of La Palma in
2010.

Generally, the water quality of local groundwater basin is good, although two
contaminates exist requiring treatment: arsenic and manganese. The City treats
the water to meet State standards to ensure contaminate levels do not exceed
those allowed for drinking water. However, if arsenic concentrations levels rise
above the State threshold, the City will need to add additional treatment
facilities at each of the two local well sites. Depending on the treatment
specifications, these plants range in cost from $1.5 to $5 million per facility.

The UWMP identifies build out at year 2035, with an adequate water supply for a
population increase of 1,155 people over the baseline population level of
15,544 people (which includes services the City has in from the City of Cerritos).
For this purpose, build out assumes five new commercial connections, four new
industrial connections, four new government connections, and four new
landscape connections. This is accommodated with an identified increase of
125 acre-feet per year (AFY) over the 25-year period from 2010 to 2035.

Table 1: La Palma Water Demand shows the estimate from the UWMP on the
water demand by land use category through year 2035.

Water System Infrastructure 
Water system infrastructure is installed throughout the City, with all properties
having access to domestic water service. The municipal water system is
constructed of transite lines which, according to City staff, are in "good overall
condition." Based on a review of data from previous years, the City typically
experiences a break on the main lines about once a year. Main line repairs to
are accomplished with C900 plastic piping.

Laterals are primarily constructed of copper lines and on average, about 12
lateral line breaks occur annually. These repairs are also made using plastic
piping. According to staff, breaks in the lateral lines occur due to the
characteristics of the soils and increase during the re-paving of roads. Heavy
equipment vibration and loads can cause punctures in the lines.

With regard to the wells, because of their age and normal deterioration, staff
anticipates that one of the two City wells may need to be re-drilled in the next
10 to 20 years. However, the well was inspected in 2011 and was determined to
still be in good condition since it showed no signs of corrosion.
Water Users 
The major water users within the City are schools, apartments, and ADP (a
payroll processing company). As noted above, Walker Junior High School and
John F. Kennedy High School are served by Golden State Water Company (Los
Alamitos district). GSWC also serves to cities of Cypress, Los Alamitos, and
Stanton, as well as portions of Buena Park, Garden Grove, unincorporated
Rossmoor, and Seal Beach. According to GSWC staff, adequate water supply
exists to continue to provide water service to schools they serve in La Palma into
the foreseeable future.

The City of La Palma has an agreement with the Anaheim Union High School
District for Kennedy High School and Walker Junior High School to receive water
for fire-fighting purposes at no cost; this agreement had a sunset date of 2008.
However, the City continues to provide this service to the schools at no cost
despite the contract expiring. According to City staff, the Anaheim Union
School District is reviewing whether it will continue to contract with GSWC or the
City of La Palma for both domestic and fire-flow water service. City staff states
that the City has adequate capacity to provide domestic service in addition to
fire-flow water service to the schools.

Reclaimed Water 
Currently, reclaimed water supplies are not available in La Palma. West of the
Coyote Creek Channel is a wastewater recycling plant in the City of Cerritos.
The City of La Palma would like to tie into this facility to provide irrigation to the
linear park located within the Southern California Edison (SCE) power line
easement and to Central Park. The cost of tying in to the system and crossing
the channel is estimated at $1.0 million. This cost does not include installation
of new piping for recycled irrigation water to the SCE easement and Central
Park. Funds have not been allocated, and City staff indicates the only way to
finance a tie into this facility would be via State or federal grant funding. If
implemented, approximately 30 acres of open space areas could be irrigated
with reclaimed water instead of the potable water currently used.



III. Wastewater 
Information on the sewage collection system was provided by City Public Works
staff. As of April 2012, the City was in the process of preparing a new Sewer
Master Plan, with an anticipated completion date of June 2012.

Sewer Infrastructure 
Sewage collection services are provided by the City of La Palma. The Orange
County Sanitation District (OCSD) is responsible for treatment. OCSD uses the
treated sewage water to replenish the County's groundwater system.
Sewage Collection 
All properties in La Palma are served by a public sanitary sewer system. City
maintenance staff indicates the system is in good operating condition and has
adequate capacity to serve the entire city. The collection system consists of
vitrified clay pipe (VCP) lines that were originally installed in the mid-1960s.

Staff indicates that the City has no plans or and does not anticipate any major
changes needed for sewage collection system with one exception. The existing
sewer main located within the centerline of La Palma Avenue needs to be lined.
The sewer line is located beneath a landscaped median in the center of the
street which will have to be demolished if reconstructed versus lined due to
gaining access to the sewer line for construction. Reconstruction of the median
will add cost to the sewer main improvement project if reconstruction is
pursued versus lining. This cost has not been evaluated at this time.

Sewer System Maintenance 
The City performs scheduled maintenance annually on the sewer system to
ensure it continues to work properly. This includes cleaning and encrustation
removal. The overall maintenance schedule is more frequent than a typical
sewer system experiences since La Palma is relatively flat, thus resulting in
lower flow velocities system-wide. According to City staff, much of the system
has a slope of less than one-half of one percent (< of 0.5%).

In addition to the annual maintenance throughout the system, maintenance is
performed quarterly on targeted areas which require additional servicing due to
more intense use.

The target areas which require additional servicing are generally near
restaurants which introduce fats, oils, and grease into the system, as well as
apartment complexes which produce higher volumes of wastewater. The
quarterly maintenance is deemed adequate to ensure the collection system
flows without additional problems.

City staff noted the increased usage of low-flow toilets has caused some
additional service issues since the lower water volumes tends to reduce the
amount of fluids necessary to keep the system flowing.

Ten "hot spot" locations (areas of increased maintenance frequency) in the sewer
system were identified by staff, as shown on Exhibit 1: Sewer Systems Hot
Spots. These locations have been slated for repair and consist of spot repairs
only; no major pipe replacement is anticipated in these areas. Some repairs
have already been conducted.

Wastewater Discharge 
Wastewater collected in the City's sewer system flows to regional facilities
operated by the Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) which serves a
majority of the jurisdictions located in Orange County. OCSD owns three
facilities that serve La Palma:

      The Los Alamitos Sub-trunk
      The Westside Relief Interceptor
      The Miller-Holder Trunk
The Los Alamitos Sub-trunk is an 18-inch VCP line that runs along Denni Street
south of La Palma Avenue. This line was identified as having future capacity
concerns in the OCSD's 2006 Strategic Plan Update. However, a more recent
study (2009 Facility Master Plan) indicates that any project which has a
surcharge depth of six feet for a sewer that is approximately 10 feet deep is not
a concern for short periods of time. This means that under full capacity
situations, fluid levels are allowed to reach a depth of six feet from the surface
level when the sewer line is placed at least 10 below surface. A system would
begin to overflow if the fluids reached a level of zero feet deep. Thus, the 2009
Facility Master Plan does indicate that local sewers could be negatively impacted
by surcharging if it occurs. OCSD indicates it will continue to monitor the
situation in the future.

The Westside Relief Interceptor is a 15-inch VCP line that begins at the
intersection of Crescent and Moody and continues south. Capacity issues have
not been identified for this pipe.

The Miller-Holder Trunk sewer is a 45-inch reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) that
runs along the eastern boundary of the City. Capacity issues have not been
identified for this pipe.

The OCSD is currently able to handle flow from the City of La Palma and
surrounding local agencies. The wastewater is treated at two OCSD facilities:
Plant No. 1 in Fountain Valley and Plant No. 2 in Huntington Beach. According
to the 2009 Facilities Master Plan, which forecasts through 2030, no future
improvements are planned for these facilities as they are able to handle both
average and peak influent flows.

According to the 2009 Facility Master Plan, in 2010 the projected average
influent flow was 232.6 million gallons per day (mgd) and is anticipated to
increase to 294.2 mgd by 2030. With the current treatment plants, the average
flow capacity is 309 mgd (153 mgd at Plant No. 1 and 156 mgd at Plant No. 2),
providing an excess average flow capacity of 14.8 mgd.

Peak influent flow demand is determined utilizing the peak wet weather influent
flow data. According to the 2009 Facility Master Plan, in 2010 the projected
peak flow was 513.5 mgd and anticipated to increase to 618.8 mgd by 2030.
With the current treatment plants, there is 663.9 mgd peak flow capacity (351.9
mgd at Plant No. 1 and 312 mgd at Plant No. 2), providing an excess peak flow
capacity of 45.1 mgd.



IV. Flood Control Facilities 
Regional drainage facilities are managed by the Orange County Flood Control
District (OCFCD) which utilizes large concrete-lined channels. OCFCD indicates
that some localized flooding occurs during large storm events within the City of
La Palma area. However, no major deficiencies exist. The flood control channel
serving the City of La Palma is the Coyote Creek Flood Control Channel which
runs along the north western side of the City. Accordingly, OCFCD has no
planned improvements for the La Palma area within the OCFCD's seven-year
planning horizon.

Local drainage facilities are managed by the City of La Palma and consist of curb
and gutter surface flow along with subterranean storm drains which serve the
whole City. According to staff, not every street has storm drains. In particular,
in areas including cul-de-sac locations, the water must travel a considerable
distance in gutters before entering the storm drain system. Since La Palma is
extremely flat, City staff does receive complaints from residents about standing
water after rain storms and due to over-irrigation. Despite the known standing
water issues within the system due to the lack of grade in the curb and gutter
system, staff has identified that no improvements are planned for the storm
drain system. Staff continues to communicate with the public to minimize water
usage for irrigation in order to minimize the nuisance water in the gutters.



V. Communications 
Communications infrastructure is comprised of both wired and wireless
technologies, and is one of the fastest changing utilities provided to consumers.
The wired communications facilities within the City currently consist of
telephone, cable, and fiber optic. Wireless communications infrastructure
consists of Wi-Fi, satellite, and cellular services. It is difficult to gauge the future
breadth of wireless communications, as this industry is ever growing and
changing as technology continues to improve.

Communication service providers in La Palma are:

       AT&T - telephone and fiber optic
       Verizon - telephone and fiber optic
       Time Warner Cable ­ cable television
       City of La Palma - Wi-Fi

Telephone  
Landline telephone service is provided by AT&T and Verizon. Exhibit 2 -
Telephone Service Provider Coverage identifies AT&T's service area. Those
areas in La Palma not served by AT&T are served by Verizon.

The telephone utilities are currently the only utility which is undergrounded; a
combination of above- and below-ground wiring exists. Other utilities (cable
television and electricity) utilize overhead cables only.

AT&T provides telephone service to La Palma City Hall and a majority of the City.
AT&T indicates that the company does not experience any major problems with
system infrastructure and will promptly respond when issues arise and are
brought to their attention. The telephone infrastructure is primarily composed
of copper wiring, with some areas outfitted with a fiber optic "backbone." City
staff has identified the use of undergrounded copper wiring as a problem due to
the high water table and acidic soil. Staff mentioned that telephone service is
problematic. After each rain storm, telephone service at City facilities can be
down for several days due to these conditions. Staff did not state if this
problem occurs in other areas of the City. AT&T did not mention if the
problems experienced by City Hall are being fixed at this time.

Fiber Optic 
 
In a few areas within the City, communications facilities have been upgraded to
fiber optic cables. AT&T serves a majority of the City of La Palma and according
to City staff has installed a fiber optic "backbone" down the major arterials. The
fiber optic lines feed into copper service connections lines that connect to the
residences and businesses within their service area. AT&T indicates that fiber
optic service is provided on an "order driven" system and is pulled to the
customer at the time service is requested if the fiber optic backbone is present
in the area. AT&T indicates that the specific locations of the fiber optic lines are
proprietary; thus, no map is available.

Verizon services a few sections on the western side of the City. According to
City staff, Verizon has installed a fiber optic "backbone" in one section of the
City north of La Palma Avenue and west of Moody Street. Fiber optic service is
available to residences in this area. Verizon will only pull the lines to residences
at the time fiber optic service is requested. Verizon has not indicated if there
are plans to extend the fiber optic service into the other areas in La Palma within
Verizon's service area.

Cable Television 
Wired cable television is exclusively provided to the City of La Palma by Time
Warner Cable (TWC). Cable service is available throughout the entire City via a
franchise agreement. Other services, such as internet services and digital
telephone, are also provided by TWC as these technologies become available.
TWC has identified that the company will continue to provide "enhanced"
services to its customers as the technology changes. According to TWC, the
system operates without any major problem, and improvements are only
anticipated as the technology changes.

Wireless "cable service" is also available to the City of La Palma via satellite
based services such as Direct TV and Dish Network. The satellite services are
not evaluated with this report since they are not franchised.

City staff indicated that facilities were once provided by TWC for local public
broadcasting. However, those facilities are no longer available to the City, and
TWC has no plans to re-establish public broadcasting facilities for La Palma. As
a result, the City is currently unable to utilize local access for public television,
which was previously used for broadcasting public meetings and posting
bulletins. The City has set aside Public, Educational, and Government (PEG)
Program funding to establish new facilities to utilize public access television. At
this time, the City has not started to work on providing new facilities for this
purpose.

Source: AT&T, 2012.
Public meetings are currently webcast since the City cannot utilize public access
television. However, the cable channel is still available for the City to use once
new facilities are constructed.

WiFi 
The City is in the process of establishing facilities to provide free Wi-Fi access in
public places (library, parks, etc.). Wi-Fi access is currently available at City Hall
and the public library located on Walker Street, and the City is studying potential
expansion to public parks. Additionally, staff indicated that they would like to
eventually provide Wi-Fi "hot spots" in local commercial centers.

Wi-Fi is also provided by a number of individual business operators in their
establishments for use by consumers. These Wi-Fi services are not evaluated
with this report.

Emergency Communications 
The City's Police department and other emergency response services such as
fire and paramedics have well-integrated systems with other regional and local
agencies to help ensure quick and concerted responses to emergency situations.
According to the City's Police Department, the system they have in place
operates properly and no improvements are needed for the emergency
communications systems.

2.0       CIRCULATION SYSTEM 
The  City  of  La  Palma  is  located  in  the  northwestern  portion  of  Orange  County  and  is  bordered 
on  the  east  by  the  City  of  Buena  Park  and  on  the  south  by  City  of  Cypress.   La  Palma's  western 
and  northern  boundary  lies  on  the  Orange  County/Los  Angeles  County  boundary,  with  the  City 
of Cerritos on the Los Angeles County side of the boundary on both the west and north. 
 
The  roadway  system  in  the  City  generally  follows  a  northsouth  grid  system.   Regional  access  is 
provided  primarily  by  State  Route  91  (SR  91),  which  provides  convenient  connections  to  I605 
and  I5.    Access  to  SR  91  is  at  three  interchanges  in  the  area:    Carmenita  Road/Moody  Road, 
Orangethorpe Avenue and Valley View Street. 
2.1       LOCAL CIRCULATION 
The  City  of  La  Palma  has  a  defined  roadway  classification  system.    The  classification  of  a 
roadway  is  intended  to  establish  its  function,  or  role,  in  the  overall  circulation  system.    It 
establishes  the  hierarchy  of  streets  in  terms  of  their  purpose  in  relation  to  movement  of 
through traffic versus provision of access to adjacent land uses. 
 
The  hierarchy  of  roadway  classifications  ranges  from  freeways  (with  full  control  access,  grade
separated  interchanges,  high  speed/high  volume  traffic,  emphasis  on  longer  distance  and 
intercity  travel)  to  local  streets  and  culdesacs  (with  unlimited  access  to  fronting  properties, 
low speed/low volume traffic, emphasis on multipurpose of the paved street section for travel, 
parking, pedestrian and bicycle activity). 
 
The  arterial  roadways  are  a  component  of  the  County  of  Orange  Master  Plan  of  Arterial 
Highways  (MPAH).   This  plan  was  designed  to  facilitate  the  efficient  movement  of  people  and 
goods  throughout  the  entire  County.    The  MPAH  arterial  highway  standards  are  defined  as 
follows: 
 
    · Major  Arterial  Highway:   This  is  designed  as  a  sixlane  divided  highway  with  an  ultimate 
        right  of  way  of  120  feet  and  a  typical  curb  to  curb  width  of  104  feet.   A  Major  Arterial 
        highway can accommodate between 30,000 to 45,000 vehicles per day. 
         
        Orangethorpe  Avenue  is  classified  as  a  Major  Arterial  in  the  City  of  La  Palma.   From  the 
        western  City  boundary  at  Moody  Street,  easterly  across  the  Coyote  Creek  bridge  to 
        Somerset Circle, the road is four lanes, two lanes in east direction.  From Somerset circle 
        to the eastern City boundary, the roadway is six lanes, three in each direction. 
         
        Valley  View  Street  is  also  a  Major  Arterial  in  the  City  of  La  Palma.    Falling  along  the 
        eastern City boundary, the roadway is six lanes, three in each direction. 
         
    · Primary  Arterial  Highway:    This  is  designated  as  a  fourlane  divided  highway  with  an 
        ultimate  right  of  way  of  100  feet,  and  a  typical  curb  to  curb  width  of  84  feet.   A  Primary 
        Arterial highway can accommodate between 20,000 and 30,000 vehicles per day.

                     EXISTING TRANSPORTATION SETTING AND CONDITIONS   
 
           Two  primary  roadways  are  located  in  La  Palma.   La  Palma  Avenue,  an  eastwest  street 
           which  generally  has  four  lanes,  two  in  each  direction  except  at  the  bridge  over  Coyote 
           Creek, where it is just one lane in each direction. 
            
           Moody Street is also a Primary Arterial in the City.  This northsouth roadway has a total 
           of four lanes, two in each direction. 
            
       ·   Secondary  Arterial  Highway:   This  is  designated  as  a  fourlane  undivided  highway  with 
           an  ultimate  right  of  way  width  of  80  feet,  and  a  typical  curb  to  curb  width  of  64  feet.   A 
           Secondary  Arterial  highway  can  accommodate  between  10,000  and  20,000  vehicles  per 
           day. 
            
           There  are  three  Secondary  Arterial  roadways  in  the  City  of  La  Palma.   Walker  Street  is  a 
           northsouth  roadway  with  four  lanes,  two  in  each  direction  from  the  southern  City 
           boundary  to  Fresca  Drive,  which  is  north  of  Orangethorpe  Avenue.    At  that  point,  the 
           roadway  transitions  to  one  lane  in  each  direction  and  crosses  Coyote  Creek,  and  then 
           widens to two lanes in each direction to the northern boundary. 
            
           Crescent  Avenue  is  an  eastwest  roadway  on  the  City's  southern  boundary  area.  
           Crescent  Avenue  is  a  fourlane  roadway,  with  two  lanes  in  each  direction.    Houston 
           Avenue  is  also  an  eastwest  Secondary  roadway,  between  Moody  Street  and  Walker 
           Street.  It is currently one lane in each direction. 
 
The Existing Circulation Plan is shown in Figure 2 and the standard roadway cross sections are 
shown in Figure 3.

2.3         INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE (LOS) CRITERIA 
Intersection  operations  are  evaluated  using  a  Level  of  Service  (LOS)  system.  The  concept  of 
level  of  service  is  used  to  characterize  how  well  the  roadway  network  operates.  The  signalized 
intersections  are  evaluated  using  the  Volume  to  Capacity  (V/C)  based  Intersection  Capacity 
Utilization  (ICU)  methodology.  This  methodology  results  in  level  of  service  measurements, 
indicating  the  quality  of  traffic  flow  and  using  letter  grades  from  A  (best)  to  F  (worst).  The  City 
of  La  Palma's  level  of  service  standards,  as  published  in  the  City's  General  Plan,  is  LOS  D  for 
peak  hour  intersection  operations.  The  level  of  service  range  for  signalized  intersections  is 
provided below in Table 3.

                movements are easily made, and nearly all drivers find freedom of operation. 
                Very good operation.  Many drivers begin to feel somewhat restricted within 
       B        platoons of vehicles.  This represents stable flow.  An approach to an intersection      0.61  0.70 
                may occasionally be fully utilized and traffic queues start to form. 
                Good operation.  Occasionally drivers may have to wait more than 60 seconds, and 
       C        backups may develop behind turning vehicles.  Most drivers feel somewhat                 0.71  0.80 
                restricted. 
                Fair operation.  Cars are sometimes required to wait more than 60 seconds during 
       D        short peaks.  There are no longstanding traffic queues.  This level is typically         0.81  0.90 
                associated with design practice for peak periods. 
                Poor operation.  Some longstanding vehicular queues develop on critical

2.4       ROADWAY LOS VOLUMETOCAPACITY (V/C) CRITERIA  
Roadway  segments  are  evaluated  by  calculating  the  volumetocapacity  (V/C)  ratio  based  on 
the  average  daily  traffic  (ADT)  volumes  to  street  capacity  according  to  the  City's  roadway 
classifications.  Capacity  is  a  measure  of  the  ability  of  the  street  system  to  meet  and  serve  the 
demands  placed  on  it.  It  is  generally  considered  the  most  practical  measure  of  how  well  the 
mobility needs of the City are being met.  
 
The  capacity  of  the  road  is  affected  by  a  number  of  factors,  including  street  width,  roadway 
design,  number  of  travel  lanes,  number  of  roadway  intersections,  number  of  driveways, 
presence of onstreet parking, and traffic signal cycle length.  
 
The  City's  roadway  classification  capacities  are  based  on  the  Orange  County  Transportation 
Authority (OCTA) Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH). The capacities are shown in Table 4 
below.

The  City  of  La  Palma  and  OCTA  use  the  LOS  C  threshold  for  impact  determination.   As  shown  in 
Table 4, for a Primary Arterial, the maximum ADT for LOS C is 30,000 vehicles per day. 
 
As noted in section 2.1, the primary roadway networks within the City of La Palma are classified 
according  to  the  City's  roadway  classification  standards.  Table  5  shows  a  summary  of  the 
primary roadways and the existing roadway classification in the City of La Palma.

2.5         LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS 
2.5.1 INTERSECTIONS 
 
A  total  of  five  signalized  intersections  in  the  City  of  La  Palma  were  identified  as  study 
intersections.  Traffic  counts  and  field  review  were  conducted  at  the  five  study  intersections  in 
December  2011  for  performance  evaluation  using  the  ICU  methodology.  Level  of  service 
analysis  was  conducted  for  the  highest  one  hour  traffic  during  the  AM  (7AM  ­  9AM)  and  PM 
(4PM  ­  6PM)  periods.  Existing  lane  configurations  and  traffic  volumes  for  the  five  study 
intersections  are  illustrated  in  Figures  5  and  6,  respectively.  Table  6  provides  the  existing 
conditions  level  of  service  results  for  the  five  study  intersections.  As  shown,  three  of  the  five 
study intersections currently operate at an acceptable level of service of LOS D or better during 
the  AM  and  PM  peak  hours.  The  two  study  intersections  that  are  currently  operating  below 
acceptable LOS D during either the AM or PM peak hours are as follow:

2.5.2 ROADWAY LINKS 
 
The  average  daily  traffic  (ADT)  volumes  were  collected  along  roadways  within  the  City  in 
September  2011  by  the  City  of  La  Palma.  The  2011  daily  traffic  volumes  are  shown  in  Figure  7. 
Using  the  maximum  daily  roadway  capacity  values  shown  in  Table  4,  the  daily  volumeto
capacity  ratios  have  been  determined  for  the  roadway  link  locations  and  are  shown  in  Table  7.  
The existing 2011 ADT volumes indicate that most of the study roadway segments are currently 
operating within the designed capacity and satisfactory level of service except for the following 
three locations: 
 
    · Walker Street between La Palma Avenue and Los Palos Circle ­ LOS D 
    · Orangethorpe Avenue between Walker Street and SR 91 ­ LOS D 
    · Orangethorpe Avenue between SR 91 and Valley View Street ­ LOS E.

2.9     PACIFIC ELECTRIC RIGHTOFWAY CORRIDOR 
  
The  Pacific  Electric  RightofWay  (PEROW)  /  West  Santa  Ana  Branch  Corridor  is  a  railroad  right
ofway  that  extends  for  approximately  20  miles  between  the  City  of  Paramount  in  Los  Angeles 
County  and  the  City  of  Santa  Ana  in  Orange  County,  and  forms  the  southwestern  border  of  the 
City  of  La  Palma.  The  railroad  corridor  was  once  part  of  the  Pacific  Electric  Railway,  or  Red  Car, 
system  that  provided  mass  transit  service  to  Southern  California  from  1901  to  1961.  Much  of 
the  corridor  has  been  abandoned  and  is  not  currently  used  for  mass  transit  purposes.   Several 
jurisdictions along the Corridor have developed the PEROW area into trails and walkways. 
 
A  coordinated  Orange  County/Los  Angeles  County/Orangeline  Development  Authority  (OLDA) 
Alternatives Analysis (AA) study is currently underway.  The AA examines options for connecting 
to the Metro Blue Line, Metro Green Line, and Los Angeles Union Station on the north end, and 
to  the  Santa  Ana  Regional  Transportation  Center  on  the  south  end.  The  alternatives  generally 
follow  the  PEROW  /  West  Santa  Ana  Branch  corridor.  The  AA  evaluates  a  broad  range  of 
alternatives, including:  
 
     · No Build Alternative 
     · Transportation System Management (TSM) Alternative 
     · BRT Alternative ­ StreetRunning and HOV LaneRunning options 
     · Street Car Alternative 
     · LRT Alternative 
     · Low Speed Magnetic Levitation Alternative. 
 
The  City  of  La  Palma  is  participating  in  the  AA  study  with  a  Councilmember  appointed  to  the 
Steering Committee and a City Engineer assigned to the Technical Advisory Committee. Overall, 
the  City  is  supportive  of  regional  transportation  alternatives  as  long  as  they  do  not  impact  or 
interfere with the quality of life within the City of La Palma.  At present, the City is encouraging 
the "no build" alternative during this analysis process.  
 
The  City  Council  has  previously  adopted  Resolutions  stating  opposition  to  any  development  of 
the  former  PEROW,  where  it  abuts  the  City's  jurisdictional  boundaries,  for  transit  or 
transportation  purposes.  The  resolutions  are  Resolution  200926  adopted  on  June  2,  2009, 
Resolution  200708  adopted  on  March  6,  2007,  and  Resolution  200517  adopted  on  April  5, 
2005.

Subject:     Proposed General Plan Land Use Designation Descriptions




PROPOSED LAND USE PLAN
Land use categories define the type, nature, and intensity of development allowed on all properties in the
City, with the categories applied as indicated on the Land Use Policy Map (also attached to this staff
report). Table 1 below lists the proposed categories and indicates the density, intensity, and population
standards for each, as well as the corresponding zoning districts. The paragraphs below Table 1 generally
describe the proposed land uses allowed within each category.

1.     RESIDENTIAL CATEGORIES
Three residential designations provide for a range of densities and housing types. The upper limit of a
prescribed range defines the maximum number of units per net acre at which development can occur. Net
acre is defined as the gross project or lot area, less that portion of the site used dedicated for use as a
public road and for flood control channels.

Residential uses are intended to be the principal and dominant use within each residential category. Other
allowed uses include public facilities/utilities, family day care facilities (as defined in the California Health
and Safety Code), and home occupations, as determined to be compatible with residential areas and
specifically addressed in the Zoning Code.

a) Single Family Residential
   1 to 8.7 Dwelling Units per Net Acre

The Single Family Residential category provides for a range of single-family housing types, including
conventional single-family detached homes, patio homes, zero lot line homes, and attached lower-density
developments such as duplexes. The average density for single-family development citywide is
approximately 8.8 dwelling units per net acre. Zoning standards that require a minimum 5,000-square-
foot lot for a single-family dwelling yield 8.7 dwelling units per net acre. Thus, conventional lots shall have
a minimum size of 5,000 square feet.

b) Multiple Family Residential
   8.8 to 25 Dwelling Units per Net Acre

The Multiple Family Residential category accommodates development of attached residential uses. Typical
housing types include higher-density attached multiple family dwellings such as duplexes, townhouses,
condominiums, and garden apartments.

c) Village Multiple Family Residential
   8.8 to 30 Dwelling Units per Net Acre

The Village Multiple Family Residential category provides for a variety of housing types within one project
or development, ranging from single-family housing to multiple family dwellings, as well as uses incidental
to the residential uses. The types of developments suitable within the Village Multiple Family Residential
category include housing projects targeted for households of more limited income and senior residents.
Development standards may be tailored to achieve higher densities, but site design requirements include
sensitivity to surrounding properties.


2.     NON-RESIDENTIAL AND MIXED USE CATEGORIES
Each of the non-residential and mixed use categories indicates the dominant use intended, appropriate
secondary uses, and the maximum intensity at which uses can occur. For non-residential uses, the
building intensity limits are prescribed via the floor-area ratio (FAR). The FAR is the ratio of total gross
floor area of a building on the lot to the total lot area. Floor area does not include area within parking

structures. FAR describes the intensity of the use on a site but not the building height or site coverage.
Exhibit II-5, Example Floor-Area Ratio Calculation illustrates the variation in height and site coverage that
can be achieved with the same FAR applied to a site. The FAR shall be calculated based on the net lot area,
as defined above.

For residential uses within a mixed-use development, the maximum number of units per net acre at which
development can occur is prescribed. The maximum allowable FAR is applicable only to non-residential
uses and does not apply to residential buildings. As indicated in the Zoning Code, some allowed uses may
require a Conditional Use Permit.

a) Neighborhood Commercial
   Maximum FAR: 0.5

The Neighborhood Commercial category provides for localized commercial retail and service activities in
close proximity to residential neighborhoods. Typical uses include restaurants, food markets, drug stores,
clothing stores, sporting goods stores, cleaners, banks, offices, child care centers, hardware stores, other
retail and personal services uses, and community facilities. Neighborhood commercial projects should be
compatible in design and scale with adjacent residential areas, and should be designed to provide
convenient connections to the neighborhoods.

b) Mixed Use - Town Center
   Maximum FAR: 1.5
   Residential Density: 8.8 to 30 Dwelling Units per Net Acre

The Mixed Use - Town Center designation is intended to create a community destination and focal point on
Walker Street complementary to Central Park, with civic uses, open spaces, professional and government
offices, lower-scale service and retail commercial businesses, limited institutional uses, and residences.
The sharing of parking and open space amenities among uses is encouraged. Residential developments are
required to include a nonresidential component, such as office or retail; no residential component is
permitted on the ground floor of a building. The singular exception to this nonresidential requirement is
development projects that are exclusively intended for senior living or assisted living facilities.

Buildings should be oriented toward and near the street frontage, with parking facilities tucked behind.
Developments shall have attractive and distinctive architectural design that distinguishes the City core,
with convenient pedestrian access among uses. Design considerations must include sensitivity to lower-
intensity residential neighborhoods.

c) Mixed Use - Arterial District
   Maximum FAR: 1.5
   Residential Density: 15 to 40 Dwelling Units per Net Acre

The Mixed Use - Arterial District (MU-AD) category allows for the creation of mixed use districts along the
City's major arterials. MU-AD provides for a compatible/complementary mix of employment, commercial,
hospitality, and residential uses either as part of an integrated development or as uses within a district.
Permitted business activities include regional and neighborhood-serving retail and service commercial,
mid-rise hotels, and professional offices. Residential uses are permitted either as a stand-alone use or
integrated vertically or horizontally into a commercial development. Connections and amenities to be

utilized to tie uses together include themed landscaping, well-marked and convenient pedestrian
travelways, and signage. Where multistory buildings are proposed on sites adjacent to lower-density
residential neighborhoods, site and building design shall be sensitive to the adjacent neighborhood.

d) Mixed Use - Freeway District
   Maximum FAR: 3.0
   Residential Density: 20 to 60 Dwelling Units per Net Acre

The Mixed Use - Freeway District (MU-FD) category is designed to be La Palma's highest intensity district,
taking advantage of the regional access and high visibility afforded by the SR-91 freeway. MU-FD provides
for a compatible/complementary mixture of employment, commercial, hospitality, and residential uses.
Permitted business activities include corporate headquarters, administrative and professional offices,
limited research and development operations, banks, multi-story hotels, business support services,
entertainment, restaurants, and retail commercial. Specifically prohibited are industrial uses. Residential
uses in the form of higher-intensity, multi-unit developments are permitted. However, all residential
projects must include a non-residential component. All developments must offer attractive and distinctive
architectural building design, integrated site layouts, ample landscaping enhancements, and convenient
pedestrian access among uses.


e) Industrial
   Maximum FAR: 0.6

The Industrial category provides for establishment of non-intrusive, jobs-intensive industrial uses,
including manufacturing, assembly, distribution, research and development, telecommunications, science
laboratories, and utility buildings/facilities. Uses may include ancillary office and commercial or wholesale
sales activities directly associated with the business. Commercial developments such as home
improvement stores and wholesale and retail commercial activities may be permitted. New warehousing
uses may be permitted only where it can be demonstrated that the use provides a substantial financial
benefit to the City.

f) Public/Institutional
   Maximum FAR: 0.6

The Public/Institutional category supports establishment of diverse uses: public schools, government
offices, police and fire stations, public utilities and easements, outdoor recreational uses, flood
control channels, libraries, museums, churches, and cultural facilities. Public and institutional uses
may also be permitted in other land use categories under regulations established in the Zoning Code.

g) Open-Space/Recreation
   Maximum FAR: Not applicable

The Open-Space/Recreation category encompasses park lands developed for recreational use. Only
accessory buildings or those structures related to parks and recreation facilities are intended for open
space lands. Certain commercial outdoor recreation uses may be permitted as a conditional use per
Zoning Code regulations.

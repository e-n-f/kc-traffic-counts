1. Introduction

Florida Transportation Engineering, Inc. was retained to provide a comprehensive assessment to
identify needs, and elaborate recommendations with an action plan for improving the current traffic
operation conditions in the vicinity of the Waterstone/South Dade Venture CDD during the AM and
PM periods. This study was initiated following requests from Alvarez Engineers, Inc the current
community engineering firm as a petition of the residents board directives and neighbor'
complaints regarding safety issues. This study included field observations, data collection, roadway
performance outlook, traffic review and the development of conclusions, recommendations with a
short/long range action plan.

2. Background

The Waterstone/South Dade Venture CDD is a 388 gross acres residential community approved
since 2001 by the City of Homestead. This community contains over 2,200 households that were
built in two phases including a Charter school serving from kindergarten to Middle school. Today,
the City of Homestead ranks among the top fastest growing development areas as a result of the
accelerated population growth. The current traffic conditions around within the community have
raised the safety concerns and several complaints from neighbors have been brought to the
attention of the residents' board.

3. Assessment of Adequacy of Existing facilities

A Professional Traffic Operations Engineer conducted field reviews of the existing conditions in the
vicinity of Waterstone/South Dade Venture CDD during peak hours of 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and
4:00 PM to 6:00 PM, on Tuesday May 29, 2007. Observations included assessments of existing
conditions, characteristics and, deficiencies in relation to site geographic location, land use,
roadway network, intersection operations, traffic volumes, and traffic conflicts affecting this vicinity.

3.1 Site Location and Land Use

Waterstone/South Dade Venture CDD is a community development district within the City of
Homestead located about 25 miles south of the Miami' downtown. This area is enclosing mainly
low to medium density single-family residential homes, lakes, bike trails, roads, parks, and the
Waterstone Charter School.

The roadway vicinity boundaries are delimited as follows: From the north with the SW 288th Street
(Biscayne Drive), from the south SW 312th Street (Campbell Drive), from the west the Florida
Turnpike, and from the east SW 137th Avenue (Tallahassee Blvd). However, the community three
main accesses are provided only by south and east corridors.

Based on the latest functional classification of SW 312th Street (Campbell Drive) and SW 137th
Avenue (Tallahassee Blvd) are considered as urban collectors under the Miami-Dade County
maintenance jurisdiction.

3.3 Critical Intersections
The Waterstone/South Dade Venture CDD Community includes five critical intersections identified
as per field observations. Three of those locations are the three main accesses which are two-way
stop controlled intersections, one roundabout at the intersection of Waterstone Way and NE 41st
Terrace, and one is a semi-actuated signalized intersection, (SW 312th Street at SW 137th Avenue),
as part of Traffic Control Section 222 with the Controller 3231.

The following pictures show the approaches and lane groups at these locations. Figure 6 presents
the controller timing data during AM and PM peaks at SW 312th Street and SW 137th Avenue,
respectively.

4. Identification of Existing Operational and Safety Issues

In order to Identify the existing operational and safety issues in South Dade Venture CDD
Community traffic observations, traffic data collection and intersection performance analyses
were performed for the main roads and key intersections that affect the residents journey
during AM and PM peak periods. Figure 6 depicts the existing operations, traffic volumes and
traffic safety issues within the community.

4.1 Field Observations

The field observations during the AM and PM peak within the community included assessment
of traffic patterns, identification critical elements, conflicts, and evaluation of activities that will
assist to formulate recommendations to improve the current traffic conditions.

    ·    During the AM peak several vehicles were observed exiting the community throughout
         the main accesses heading west and north primarily. On the other hand, most of the


                                             Page 10
                       TRAFFIC STUDY
              Waterstone-South Dade Venture CDD
    traffic entering the community are vehicles traveling southbound along SW 137th
    Avenue or eastbound along SW 312th Street

·   During the AM peak, the high volume traffic entering the community is related to arrival
    activities at the Waterstone Carter School.

·   Queues and delays of vehicles exiting this community throughout Waterstone Blvd.
    with SW 312th Street and Waterstone Blvd. with SW 137th Avenue during the AM peak.

·   Large differential of high speed between the vehicles traveling along the side streets
    and the vehicles along the critical corridors during both peak periods.

·   Some delays and unsafe maneuvers were observed by vehicles performing eastbound
    left turn movements at the intersection of SW 312 Street/Campbell Drive during the
    AM and PM peaks.
·   During the AM peak, several school buses picking up students were observed along
    the primary corridors of the community. Some locations such as the intersection of
    Waterstone Blvd and NE 10th Court side street traffic were blocked by school buses

·   Over-generous tires swept were observed at the roundabout over at Waterstone Way
    at NE 41st Terrace. The circle wide radii at the exits for traffic heading east and west
    allow those vehicles to easily accelerate.

·   Low visibility was perceived prior the bridge over the Waterstone Channel for
    approaching vehicles.

·   Several tire break skid marks were found from vehicles heading south that after
    crossing the bridge in front of the Waterstone Club house sharp horizontal curve.
    Several indications that vehicles had runaway over the lawn at this location.

·   Two vehicles concurrently were observed trapped at the median openings to exit the
    community by performing left turn movements from Waterstone Way and Waterstone
    Blvd with SW 137th Avenue and SW 312th Street.

·   It was also noted that the location of the two future guard-houses along Waterstone
    Way are approximately 120 feet which would be able to hold 3 to 4 vehicles in line.
    However, based on the observations, several vehicles heading to the school will
    require to cross through the guard-house to enter the community through SW 312th
    Street.

Signing and Pavement Markings

Based on the field observations the pavement markings and signing along the key corridors
are in good conditions. However, the following safety concern regarding signing and pavement
markings were identified:

        Some signs present visual obstructions
        Lack of signs to warn the visibility and horizontal change of alignment issues prior to
        the bridge over the Waterstone channel for vehicles heading south on Waterstone
        Way.
        The warning signs at the approaches of the roundabout at Waterstone Way with NE
        41st Terrace do not meet the latest 2003 MUTCD standards

        Lack of guide signs, pedestrian signs, and/or pavement markings to direct traffic within
        the roundabout in accordance with the 2003 MUTCD.

        Paint demarcations for future stripping were observed along Waterstone Way.

4.2 Data Collection
Data collection activities included four-hour turning movement counts performed during the
week of March 6, 2006 at the following locations:

    o SW 137th Avenue/Tallahassee Drive at Waterstone Way

    o SW 312th Street/Campbell Drive at Waterstone Way

    o SW 312th Street at SW 137th Avenue/Tallahassee Drive
Results from the raw turning movement count volumes during school peak hours are
documented in Appendix A. The TMC information reveals that the peak hour traffic that enters
this community are 360 vehicles throughout the intersection of SW 312 Street and Waterstone
Way during the AM peak while similar volumes were recorded at the intersection of SW 137th
Avenue and Waterstone Way during the PM peak.

4.3 Existing Level of Service

A level of service analysis (LOS) was performed using SYNCHRO version 6.0 by simulate the
existing traffic and geometric conditions for AM and PM traffic peak hours. This analysis
follows the procedures and methodologies outlined in the "Highway Capacity Manual (HCS)
2000 Edition" for signalized intersections.

Analysis of level of services for signalized intersections are based on amount of control delay
which is a measurement in seconds per vehicle that acts as an indicator of lost time, fuel
consumption, frustration and driver's discomfort at the signalized intersections. The level of

                  Waterstone-South Dade Venture CDD
services for signalized intersections is a scale from "A" to "F" in accordance to control delays
thresholds that range from less than 10 seconds to greater than 80 seconds of delay per
vehicle.

In order to perform this analysis, cycle lengths and clearance intervals used in the analysis
were consistent with the current Miami-Dade signal control sections and signal operating plans
for the study intersection in conjunction with physical and operational characteristics observed
during peak hours. Details of signal timing and LOS runs are documented in Appendix B.

An assessment of level of services analysis for peak periods indicated all intersections are
operating above acceptable LOS D during both of the AM and PM peaks. However, these
analyses also indicated that the southbound left turns at Waterstone Way with SW 312th Street
and the eastbound left turns at Waterstone Way and SW 137th Avenue are operating under
substantial delay that generates stress capacity (LOS E) or failing conditions (LOS F) during
the AM and PM peak hours. In addition, these analyses concluded that the left turn movements
at the intersection of SW 312th Street with SW 137th Avenue are operating under failing
condition during the AM peak

5. Development of Recommendations and Action Plan

Based on the safety concerns found during the development of this report and the traffic
analyses performed, the following existing operational and/or safety deficiencies were
identified with an action plan and recommended. Figure 7 depicts some of the proposed
recommendations conceptual improvements.

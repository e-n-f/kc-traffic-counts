Subject: Traffic Study for Terrazo at Fountaingrove Project

Dear Mr. Futrell:

Transpedia Consulting Engineers (TCE) has prepared this traffic analysis to address anticipated traffic
impacts associated with the Terrazo at Fountaingrove Project (Project).

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Project site is located at 1601 Fountaingrove Parkway in the City of Santa Rosa. The Project will
include 66 condominium housing units, as shown in the attached site plan.

SCOPE OF WORK
Fountaingrove Parkway/Stagecoach Road/Fountaingrove Club Drive intersection and Fountaingrove
Parkway roadway segment between Fir Ridge Drive and Round Barn Boulevard were evaluated under
"Existing", "Existing Plus Approved Projects", and "Existing Plus Approved Projects Plus Project"
scenarios during weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Turning movement traffic counts at the study
intersection were collected by All Traffic Data for TCE on Tuesday, April 26, 2011 during a.m. (7:00
a.m.-9:00 a.m.) and p.m. (4:00 p.m.-6:00 p.m.) peak periods, as attached.

LEVEL OF SERVICE CONCEPT
Intersections and roadways are evaluated in terms of "level of service" (LOS), which is a measure of
driving conditions and vehicle delay. Levels of service range from A (best) to F (poorest). Levels of
service A, B and C indicate conditions where traffic can move relatively freely. Level of service D
describes conditions where delay is more noticeable. Level of service E describes conditions where
traffic volumes are at or close to capacity, resulting in significant delays. Level of service F characterizes
conditions where traffic demand exceeds available capacity, with very slow speeds (stop-and-go) and
long delays (over a minute).

SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
The signalized study intersection was evaluated with the Synchro software using the methodologies from
Chapter 16 of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. This methodology evaluates the amount of green
signal time available to each traffic approach and the total intersection capacity used by traffic demand,

and assigns a LOS based on the average control delay that drivers would experience at the intersection
during the peak hour. The criteria for the six distinct levels of service are summarized in Table 1.

                      Table 1- Level of Service Definitions for Signalized Intersections
  Level of       Average Control Delay
                                                                            Description
  Service        per Vehicle (Seconds)
                                                   Very low delay. Occurs when progression is extremely
                                                   favorable and most vehicles arrive during the green phase.
      A                    0 ­ 10.0                Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also
                                                   contribute to low delay.

                                                   Generally occurs with good progression, short cycle lengths,
      B                  10.1 ­ 20.0               or both. More vehicles stop than with LOS "A," causing
                                                   higher levels of average delay.

                                                   These higher delays may result from fair progression, longer
                                                   cycle lengths, or both. Individual cycle failures may begin to
      C                  20.1 ­ 35.0               appear at this level. The number of vehicles stopping is
                                                   significant at this level, though may still pass through the
                                                   intersection without stopping.
                                                   The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable.
                                                   Longer delays may result from some combination of
      D                  35.1 ­ 55.0               unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, or high v/c
                                                   ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not
                                                   stopping declines. Individual cycle failures are noticeable.

                                                   These high delay values generally indicate poor progression,
      E                  55.1 ­ 80.0               long cycle lengths, and high v/c ratios. Individual cycle
                                                   failures are frequent occurrences.

                                                   This level, considered to be unacceptable to most drivers,
                                                   often occurs with over saturation, that is, when arrival flow
                                                   rates exceed the capacity of the intersection. It may also
      F                     > 80.0                 occur at high v/c ratios below 1.0 with many individual cycle
                                                   failures. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also be
                                                   major contributing causes to such delay levels.

ARTERIAL LEVEL OF SERVICE
The measure of effectiveness for arterials is average travel speed along the corridor. The methodology to
determine level of service stratifies urban streets into four classifications (Table 2). Levels of Service are
related to average travel speed along the corridor (Table 3).

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
Study intersection levels of service and delay are provided to determine the magnitude of proposed
development related impacts. Although no specific requirements are established by the City for
intersection service levels, LOS D is typically considered to be an acceptable service level for signalized
intersection operations. For unsignalized intersection operation, LOS E is typically considered to be
acceptable. For arterial segments, the General Plan Policy TD-1 assigned LOS D as the standard.

EXISTING SCENARIO
The study intersection provides primary access to the Project site. Fountaingrove Parkway has two lanes
with left-turn and right-turn lanes in each direction, sidewalks along both sides, and a posted speed limit
of 40 miles per hour (mph) west of Stagecoach Road. The speed limit decreases to 35 mph east of
Stagecoach Road where the roadway reduces to one lane in each direction with left-turn and right-turn
lanes and sidewalks along both sides.

Stagecoach Road has one through, one left-turn, one right-turn and one bike lanes in the northbound
direction and two through lanes in the southbound direction. Both directions have sidewalks and a posted
speed limit of 35 mph. Traffic at Fountaingrove Parkway/Stagecoach Road/Fountaingrove Club Drive
intersection is currently controlled by a signal.

Under "Existing Scenario", the study intersection operates at acceptable level of service during weekday
a.m. and p.m. peak hours, as summarized in Table 4. Turn lane storages are expected to be capable of
handling traffic queues at 95% confidence level. Capacity and queue analysis worksheets are attached.

TRIP GENERATION

The trip generation for the Project was estimated based on rates provided in Trip Generation, 8th
Edition, 2008 published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The land use category
for the Project consists of Residential Condominium/Townhouse (ITE Land Use Code 230). The
Project would generate 383 daily trips with 29 trips (7 inbound and 22 outbound) during the a.m.
peak hour and 34 trips (21 inbound and 13 outbound) during the p.m. peak hour, as summarized in
Table 6.

Previously "Approved Projects" are either (a) under construction, (b) are built but not fully occupied, or
(c) not built but have received final developmental approval from the City. The following projects are
expected to generate some traffic through the study intersection:

    Fir Ridge Workforce Housing
    Fountaingrove Lodge

"Skyfarm Unit 3" subdivision (31 single family residential units) was considered in this traffic study;
however, it was not added to the "Approved Projects" list as it is still in the appeal process and has not
been approved yet. Moreover, this project is expected to have minimal traffic impacts on the study
intersection or roadway segment as main access to the project site would be expected through Mark West
Springs Road.

These "Approved Projects" are expected to generate a total of 658 daily trips with 48 trips (20 inbound
and 28 outbound) during the a.m. peak hour and 68 trips (39 inbound and 29 outbound) during the p.m.
peak hour, as summarized in Table 7.

EXISTING PLUS APPROVED PROJECTS SCENARIO
Traffic that would be generated by the "Approved Projects" was added to the "Existing Scenario" traffic.
The "Existing Plus Approved Projects Scenario" is considered by the City as a baseline scenario for
traffic impact analysis of new developments. Under "Existing Plus Approved Projects Scenario", the
study intersection is expected to continue operating at acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better for
signalized intersections), as summarized in Table 9. Turn lane storages are also expected to be capable of
handling traffic queues at 95% confidence level. Capacity and queue analysis worksheets are attached.

SITE ACCESS
Project traffic access to the project site would be via the existing entrance of the Fountaingrove Golf
Club, which forms the northern leg of the Fountaingrove Parkway/Stagecoach Road signalized
intersection. The Project is not expected to impact the current operation of the traffic signal at this
intersection. Changes to the current signal timing plans are not warranted.

The emergency vehicle access (EVA) between the Golf Course Maintenance Road and the Project shall
be gated and locked at all times except when needed by emergency response vehicles. No private or
resident vehicles shall have access to Fountaingrove Parkway via this gate. However, golf course
maintenance vehicles may come through to use the road around to access the golf course from the athletic
facility side, so they do not go through the driving range; it is not feasible to add a new access driveway
off Fountaingrove Parkway due to topography and sight distance limitations. It is recommended to
examine the feasibility of adding a separate access gate for maintenance vehicles adjacent to the EVA.

The onsite circulation pattern appears to be adequate and typical of a residential development.

TRANSIT
Public transit service in the study area is provided by Santa Rosa CityBus. Santa Rosa CityBus operates
the Route 1, which runs on Stagecoach Road and Fountaingrove Parkway in the Project vicinity and
provides bus service twice an hour on weekdays, from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., once an hour on weekends,
on Saturdays from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and on Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

BICYCLE
There are currently Class I bike paths along Fountaingrove Parkway and Stagecoach Road in the study
area, as indicated in the Santa Rosa Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan 2010, September 2010. There is
also a Class II bike lane on Stagecoach Road northbound across from the Fountaingrove Village.

PEDESTRIANS
Sidewalks currently exist on both sides of Fountaingrove Parkway and eastern side of Stagecoach Road in
the Project vicinity. Push-button activated pedestrian signals currently exist at three legs of the
Fountaingrove Parkway/Stagecoach Road intersection signal.

Existing transit, bicycle and pedestrian facilities in the study area are expected to provide appropriate
access to the project site.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    Approved projects are expected to generate 658 trips daily, of which 48 trips during a.m. peak hour
    and 68 trips during p.m. peak hour.

    Project would generate 383 trips daily, of which 29 trips during a.m. peak hour and 34 trips during
    p.m. peak hour.

    Fountaingrove Parkway/Stagecoach Road/Fountaingrove Club Drive study intersection is expected to
    operate at acceptable levels of service during weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours under all study
    scenarios.

    The study intersection turn lane storages are expected to be capable of handling traffic queues at 95%
    confidence levels under all study scenarios.

    Fountaingrove Parkway between Fir Ridge Drive and Round Barn Boulevard Stagecoach is expected
    to operate at acceptable levels of service during weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours under all study
    scenarios.

    Project is expected to have a less-than-significant impact on the study intersection and roadway
    segment operations.

    The Project is not expected to impact the current operation of the traffic signal at the study
    intersection. Changes to the current signal timing plans are not warranted.

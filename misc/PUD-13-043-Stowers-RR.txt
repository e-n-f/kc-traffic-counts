CASE NO:               PUD-13-043

SUBJECT:               Rezoning from Prime Agriculture (A-1) to the Business Planned
                       Unit Development (BPUD) classification

LOCATION:              3585 Pioneer Trail, New Smyrna Beach

APPLICANT:             James Stowers, Esquire

OWNER:                 RR Farms, LLC.

STAFF:                 Becky Mendez, AICP, Senior Planning Manager



I. SUMMARY OF REQUEST

The applicant is requesting a rezoning of 9.63 acres from Prime Agriculture (A-1) to the
Business Planned Unit Development (BPUD) classification. The BPUD rezoning is
proposed to allow retail commercial uses in accordance with the development standards
detailed in the BPUD development agreement.

The commission and council will hear the companion small scale future land use
amendment request (case CPMA 13-004) from Agricultural Resource (AR) to Commercial
(COM) prior to this rezoning application. If the future land use amendment is approved, a
BPUD classification is appropriate.

III. Background and Previous Actions

In 2010, this property was the subject of a future land use amendment from Agricultural
Resource (AR) to Commercial (COM), which was ultimately rescinded. The previous
companion BPUD request was for 60,000 square feet of retail uses on two lots.

On June 28, 2013 the applicant submitted a small scale comprehensive plan map
amendment and rezoning similar to the previous request. The proposed future land use
map amendment limits development to 75,000 square feet and provides minimum
perimeter buffer widths. The proposed BPUD rezoning further limits development to
51,400 square feet on lot 1 and 5,000 square feet on lot 2. The development agreement of
the BPUD generally includes: phasing, permitted uses and development standards.

The following are outstanding issues related to the proposed BPUD Development
Agreement:

Parking:

In June 2012, the county council adopted reduced minimum parking requirements with the
aim of limiting impervious surface areas. The proposed BPUD allows 5 spaces per 1,000
square feet of gross floor area (GFA), compared to the existing code standard of 3 spaces
per 1,000 GFA for a grocery store use. The proposed BPUD preliminary plan indicates
246 parking spaces, which exceeds the county's zoning code by 57 spaces, or
approximately 9,750 square feet of additional impervious surface area (246 parking spaces
equals approximately 42,000 square feet of ISA).
                                                                                  Page 4 of 201




The applicant provided a parking study to support the increase. The parking analysis
projects that the peak parking demand for a suburban site is 5.05 spaces per 1,000 square
feet, and 3.2 spaces per 1,000 square feet for a rural site. In light of county council's 2011
adoption of the parking reduction ordinance, the rural nature of the site, and adjacent
agricultural, unincorporated properties, the applicant's support documentation does not
adequately justify the proposed increase.

Architectural Design:

The applicant previously included architectural design standards, supplementing the
minimum requirements of the county's code. However, the applicant's October revision
amends that proposed text by inserting "facing the public right-of-way" and deleting many
of the proffered enhancements. In order to screen adjacent properties, rear loading docks
and all exterior walls should be constructed with finished materials.

Illumination:

In order to reduce night-time urban glare and light pollution, all PUD development
agreements over the last several years have included standard illumination language,
which caps the maximum lumens produced on a site, caps the amount of light-candles
measured at property lines, and provides design standards for fixtures.

Planning for appropriate illumination in rural areas may help a commercial property blend-
in with the surrounding neighborhood. The applicant proposes to delete this section of the
BPUD development agreement in its entirety.

Administrative:

The preliminary plan attached as Exhibit B to the BPUD development agreement should be
revised so that it is clearly legible as a 8 1/2 " X 11" attachment. The plan should also
ensure that the square feet totals are consistent.

Inclusion of the parking justification memo (attached as Exhibit C to the BPUD
development agreement) is not typical and should be submitted as background
information, not an attachment.

IV. Review Criteria and Analysis

Amendment of the Official Zoning Map - Sec. 72-414. Amendment to official zoning map
procedure (e), in its review of a rezoning application, the commission shall consider:

   (1) Whether it is consistent with all adopted elements of the comprehensive plan.

This proposed BPUD rezoning is a companion to the applicant's request to change the
future land use designation from Agricultural Resource to Commercial. If the county
council approves the change to a Commercial designation, a BPUD classification may be
compatible. The comprehensive plan supports infill development, discourages strip
commercial, protects agricultural uses from encroachment, and restricts land uses that
                                                                               Page 5 of 201




have an adverse effect on the Samsula Local Plan community (See policies 1.1.3.7,
1.1.3.8, 1.1.3.11, 1.3.1.15, 1.4.1.1, 1.4.1.2, 1.4.1.3, SAM1.11.2.3, and goal 1.4).

Parking areas in excess of the maximum allowable parking unnecessarily increases
impervious surface areas and negatively impacts the natural environment. Enhanced
architectural design and illumination standards are tools to help otherwise incompatible
uses blend with the existing neighborhood. The proposed BPUD development agreement
does not offer meaningful enhancements to mitigate the impacts of the proposed
commercial activity on adjacent agricultural, rural, residential properties. Therefore, the
three outstanding issues regarding the BPUD development agreement should be
addressed.

   (2) Its impact upon the environment or natural resources.

As presented in the preliminary plan, the applicant proposes to preserve 47 out of 67
specimen trees found on site and all 5 historic trees. Open space areas that serve as tree
preservation areas are shown on the preliminary plan. The plan indicates the required 25'
wetland buffer. Protection of the environment and natural resources will be evaluated
during final site plan review.

   (3) Its impact upon the economy of any affected area.

The economic impacts of the requested rezoning will allow a commercial development that
may serve the daily commercial needs of the area. It will also provide local employment
opportunities.

   (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of Division 14 of the Land Development Code
       [article III], its impact upon necessary governmental services such as schools,
       sewage disposal, potable water, drainage, fire and police protection, solid
       waste or transportation systems.

Schools will not be impacted as this is a nonresidential use.

Potable water and sewage are to be provided by the City of Port Orange and they have
stated that adequate capacity exists for services.

Police and Fire protection will be provided by Volusia County.

Solid waste level of service is adequate to accommodate this use.

The BPUD development agreement limits the driveway connections to one onto Airport
Road and one onto Pioneer Trail. The development agreement provides for a 24-foot wide
cross access easement to the property to the east. Staff provided detailed information
regarding the potential impact to the adjacent transportation system in the future land use
map amendment report. If the land use designation is amended from agricultural to
commercial then the preliminary plan and development agreement of the BPUD rezoning
shall be reviewed during final site plan review for compliance with the land development
and zoning code.
                                                                                Page 6 of 201




     (5) Any changes in circumstances or conditions affecting the area.

There have been no changes in the area since the previous application for commercial
development of this property in 2008.

     (6) Any mistakes in the original classification.

There is no mistake in the original zoning classification of Prime Agricultural (A-1).

     (7) Its effect upon the use or value of the affected area.

The commercial use may increase the value of the affected parcel. It may also increase
the value of adjacent properties if the desire of the area is to redevelop in a more urban
form. However, if the desire of the area is to maintain the rural atmosphere then it may
negatively impact the value of adjacent rural properties.

     (8) Its impact upon the public health, welfare, safety or morals

The property owner/developer is required to obtain site plan approval and building permits
prior to development. The rezoning will not negatively impact the public health, welfare,
safety or morals.

V.      Staff Recommendation

If county council approves the future land use map amendment to Commercial the BPUD
rezoning may be consistent with the comprehensive plan if the following conditions are
incorporated:

     1. Revise the BPUD development agreement and preliminary plan so that the parking
        rate complies with existing county zoning code requirements.
     2. Revise the BPUD development agreement to include enhanced architectural
        elements and design to ensure a first class development and to mitigate the impact
        of commercial development on adjacent rural, agricultural, residential properties.
     3. Revise the BPUD development agreement to include illumination standards as
        previously drafted.
     4. Revise the BPUD development agreement for clarity:
            a. The preliminary plan attached as Exhibit B to the BPUD development
               agreement should be revised so that it is clearly legible as a 8 1/2 " X 11"
               attachment and such that the square foot totals are consistent.
            b. The parking justification memo should not be included as part of the BPUD
               development agreement, as this is atypical.

EXHIBIT "1"
                                DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT
                                     Pioneer Square
                                    Case # PUD-13-043

       A.      Development Concept.       The property shall be developed as a BPUD

substantially in accordance with the Pioneer Square Master Development Plan (the

"Pioneer Square MDP"). The Pioneer Square MDP shall govern the development of the

property as a BPUD and shall regulate the future use of this parcel.

               1.      Pioneer Square MDP. The Pioneer Square MDP shall consist of

the Preliminary Plan prepared by Zev Cohen & Associates, dated October 18, 2013 and

this Development Agreement.            The Preliminary Plan is hereby approved and

incorporated in this Development Agreement by reference as Exhibit "B". The Pioneer

Square MDP shall be filed and retained for public inspection in the Growth and

Resource Management Department and shall constitute a supplement to the Official

Zoning Map of Volusia County.

               2.      Amendments. All amendments to the Pioneer Square MDP, other

than those deemed by the Zoning Enforcement Official's reasonable opinion to be minor

amendments, in accordance with section 72-289 of the zoning code, shall require the

review and recommendation of the Planning and Land Development Regulation

Commission and action by the Volusia County Council in the same manner as a

rezoning of the parcel.

               3.      Subdivision Approval. After the Pioneer Square MDP is recorded,

and prior to any construction, including clearing and landfill, applications for Overall

Development Plan and subsequently Preliminary Plats and Final Plat of the area to be

subdivided shall be submitted for review and approval in the manner required by

Division 2 of the Land Development Code, as amended.

              4.    Final Site Plan Approval.      Prior to issuance of any permits for

construction, including clearing and landfill, a Final Site Plan shall be prepared and

submitted for review and approval in a manner required by the Land Development

Code, as amended, concurrent with, or subsequent to, the submittal of the Preliminary

Plat application. The Preliminary Plan meets the minimum submittal requirements of a

Conceptual Site Plan application in accordance with the Land Development Code.

Therefore, the Pioneer Square MDP shall be in-lieu of a Conceptual Site Plan

application, and the owner/developer is authorized to proceed with submittal of a Final

Site Plan application as stated above once this Order and Resolution has been

EXHIBIT "1"
                                DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT
                                 (Case # provided by staff)

       A.      Development Concept.        The property shall be developed as a BPUD

substantially in accordance with the Pioneer Square Master Development Plan (the

"Pioneer Square MDP"). The Pioneer Square MDP shall govern the development of the

property as a BPUD and shall regulate the future use of this parcel.

               1.      Pioneer Square MDP. The Pioneer Square MDP shall consist of

the Preliminary Plan prepared by Zev Cohen & Associates, dated __________ and this

Development Agreement. The Preliminary Plan is hereby approved and incorporated in

this Development Agreement by reference as Exhibit B. The Pioneer Square MDP

shall be filed and retained for public inspection in the Growth and Resource

Management Department and shall constitute a supplement to the Official Zoning Map

of Volusia County.

               2.      Amendments. All amendments to the Pioneer Square MDP, other

than those deemed by the Zoning Enforcement Official's reasonable opinion to be minor

amendments, in accordance with section 72-289 of the zoning code, shall require the

review and recommendation of the Planning and Land Development Regulation

Commission and action by the Volusia County Council in the same manner as a

rezoning of the parcel. Amendment to the Preliminary Plan (Exhibit B), such as building

location and orientation on the lot, reduction of building square footage, and the number

of buildings not to exceed four, shall be considered a minor amendment.

              3.     Subdivision Approval. After the Pioneer Square MDP is recorded,

and prior to any construction, including clearing and landfill, applications for Overall

Development Plan and subsequently Preliminary Plats and Final Plat of the area to be

subdivided shall be submitted for review and approval in the manner required by

Division 2 of the Land Development Code, as amended.

              4.     Final Site Plan Approval. After the Preliminary Plan is recorded,

and prior to issuance of any permits for construction, including clearing and landfill, a

Final Site Plan shall be prepared and submitted for review and approval in the manner

required by the land development code, as amended. The Preliminary Plan meets the

minimum submittal requirements of a Conceptual Site Plan application in accordance

with the land development code. Therefore, the Pioneer Square MDP shall be in-lieu of

a Conceptual Site Plan application, and the owner/developer is authorized to proceed

with submittal of a Final Site Plan application once this Order and Resolution has been

recorded.

       B.     Unified Ownership.      The Applicant or his successors has and shall

maintain unified ownership of the subject parcel until after the issuance date of the Final

Site Plan Development Order or until after issuance date of the Final Subdivision Plat

Development Order.

       C.     Phases of Development. The Property shall be generally developed with

two (2) lots as depicted on the Preliminary Plan. Although development of the Property

is expected to occur in a single phase, the development of the Pioneer Square BPUD,

Lot 1 shall be developed as Phase 1.           Lot 1 is the primary grocery store parcel

containing the grocery store structure, together with infrastructure and other

improvements supporting Pioneer Square. Lot 2 is an outparcel contiguous to Lot 1.

consistent with the uses prescribed for the proposed Pioneer Square BPUD. The

locations and sizes of said land use areas are shown on the Preliminary Plan, Exhibit B

consistent with the Pioneer Square MDP. Note, however, that the specific location of

the uses and structures within the site may change, provided they meet the

development standards provided in Section E.

INTRODUCTION
Lassiter Transportation Group, Inc. (LTG) has been retained on behalf of RR Farms, LLC to prepare a Traffic
Impact Analysis (TIA) in support of a proposed zoning change to 9.63-acre parcel currently zoned as Prime
Agriculture (A-1). The proposed zoning designation is business planned unit development (BPUD). The rezoning
is required to facilitate development of a 75,000-sq. ft. shopping center known as Pioneer Square. Language will
be provided in the BPUD development agreement to ensure that transportation impacts do not exceed the
impacts evaluated in this TIA.

The subject property is located in the northeast quadrant of the Pioneer Trail/Airport Road intersection in
unincorporated Volusia County. External access to the development is planned via two unrestricted driveways
that connect to Pioneer Trail and Airport Road. Figure 1 shows the location of the project relative to the
surrounding road network. Build-out of the development is anticipated by the end of 2018.

Study Area
A methodology letter (see Appendix A) was prepared in accordance with the Volusia Transportation Planning
Organization's (VTPO) TIA Guidelines and submitted to the County for review and comment. Comments were
received from the County and the proposed methodology was revised in accordance with the comments. The
methodology agreed upon by the county includes the following intersections and roadway segments:

Roadway Segments:
x Airport Road from Williamson Boulevard to Pioneer Trail
x Pioneer Trail from Airport Road to Turnbull Bay Road

Intersections:
x Pioneer Trail at Airport Road
x Airport Road at Williamson Boulevard
x Airport Road at Project Drive (Future)
x Pioneer Trail at Project Drive (Future)

Study Procedures
Standard engineering and planning procedures were used to determine the impacts of the proposed project.
Reference data was obtained from the Volusia County Traffic Engineering Department, the VTPO, the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE), and the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT).

Planned Roadway Improvements
The Volusia County Public Works Department, FDOT, the City of Port Orange, and the City of New Smyrna
Beach were contacted to determine if there are any planned roadway improvements within the project study area.

EXISTING ROADWAY ANALYSIS
P.M. peak-period turning movement counts were conducted at the study area intersections on May 14, 2013.
Figure 2 graphically presents these counts with the raw count data presented in Appendix B.

Unsignalized Intersection Analysis
The level of service (LOS) at an unsignalized intersection is based on the average stop delay per vehicle for the
conflicting movements within the intersection. The operating condition at the unsignalized intersection was
evaluated using the Highway Capacity Software Version 6.41 (HCS). This software utilizes the methodology
outlined in Chapter 19 of the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual, titled "Two-Way Stop-Controlled." Table 1 shows
the existing p.m. peak-hour LOS. The HCS summary sheets are located in Appendix C. As indicated in the table,
the unsignalized intersection currently operates within the adopted LOS.

Signalized Intersection Analysis
The level of service (LOS) at a signalized intersection is based on the average control delay per vehicle for the
various movements within the intersection. The operating conditions at the signalized intersections were
evaluated using Highway Capacity Software Version 6.41 (HCS). This software utilizes the methodology outlined
in Chapter 18 of the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual, titled "Signalized Intersections." Table 2 shows the existing
p.m. peak-hour LOS at the signalized intersection with the HCS summary sheets located in Appendix D. As
indicated in Table 2, the study area signalized intersection currently operates within the adopted LOS. It should
be noted that the HCS analyses were conducted using signal timings provided by the County (see Appendix E).

         Roadway Segment Analysis
         Roadway level of service describes the operating condition determined from the number of vehicles passing over
         a given section of roadway during a specified time period. It is a qualitative measure of several factors which
         include speed, travel time, traffic interruptions, freedom to maneuver, driver comfort, convenience, safety and
         vehicle operating costs. Six LOS have been established as standards by which to gauge roadway performance,
         designated by the letters A through F. The LOS categories are defined as follows:

                 Level of Service A:         Free flow, individual users virtually unaffected by the presence of others
                 Level of Service B:         Stable flow with a high degree of freedom to select operating conditions
                 Level of Service C:         Flow remains stable, but with significant interactions with others
                 Level of Service D:         High-density stable flow in which the freedom to maneuver is severely restricted
                 Level of Service E:         This condition represents the capacity level of the road
                 Level of Service F:         Forced flow in which the traffic exceeds the amount that can be served

         The 2011 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) for the study roadway segments was obtained from Volusia
         County. These volumes were converted to peak-hour two-way volumes via application of planning K-factors
         obtained from FDOT Traffic Online. The existing peak-hour two-way level of service for the study area road
         segments is shown in Table 3. Based on the analysis presented in Table 3, all roadway segments are currently
         operating within acceptable levels of service.

FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

The next step in the analysis was to determine the future traffic conditions on the study area roadways at the time
of project completion. The following documents the procedures used to determine the future traffic.

Background Traffic
Traffic on the roadway network will continue to grow due to local development approvals. FDOT Traffic Trends
software was used to calculate the average annual historical growth rates for the area roadway segments, using
the past five years of available historical AADT data provided by Volusia County (2007-2011) (see Appendix F for
trends print-outs). A minimum of 1% growth rate was used for applicable segments and was previously approved
during the methodology stage. Table 5 shows the historical growth obtained from trend analysis and applied
growth used for analysis.

Trip Generation
The trip generation for this development was determined using the trip generation rates published by the Institute
of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. For comparison purposes, the
maximum development potential under the existing zoning designation (A-1 Prime Agriculture) was calculated
and compared to the maximum development potential under the proposed zoning designation (BPUD). Under A-
1 zoning, residential is permitted at a maximum density of one unit per 10 acres. Given that the site is 9.63 acres,
only one single-family dwelling unit is permitted under the existing zoning designation. At a rate of 1.00 p.m.
peak-hour trips per dwelling unit (per ITE), the trip generation potential is one trip. As such, the net increase in
trip generation equates to the total trip generation under the proposed zoning.

Table 5 presents the daily and p.m. peak-hour trip generation for the proposed project with BPUD zoning. As
indicated in the table, the project is expected to generate 5,634 total daily trips with 496 occurring in the p.m.
peak-hour.

  Due to the nature of the proposed land use, a portion of the trips generated will be attracted from existing traffic
  on the adjacent roadways. These trips are known as pass-by traffic. The methods outlined in Volume 1 of the
  ITE Trip Generation Manual were used to estimate the pass-by trips associated with the project. As agreed to in
  the methodology letter, the pass-by trips were limited to 14% of the background traffic on roadways adjacent to

  Trip Distribution
  As agreed upon by County staff, the project trip distribution from the previous rezoning study submitted by Kimley-
  Horn & Associates, Inc. was modified and used for this analysis. The resultant distribution is graphically
  illustrated in Figure 3. Please note that the Central Florida Regional Planning Model (CFRPM), Version V was
  used to estimate the diversion of background traffic resulting from construction of the Williamson Boulevard
  Extension. The process for redistributing the trips is discussed more in the next section of this report.

  Trip Assignment
  The final step in the analysis was to assign the project traffic and 2016 background traffic to the road network.
  The 2016 background traffic was redistributed based on output from the model. As stated previously, the
  CFRPM, Version V, was used to determine net increases and decreases that are expected to result from the
  Williamson Boulevard Extension. Figure 4 graphically depicts the adjusted model volumes within the project
  study area.

  The turning movement counts at the study area intersections were adjusted for the build-out condition based on
  the data presented in Figure 4. Figure 5 graphically presents the build-out p.m. peak-hour turning movements.

FUTURE ROADWAY ANALYSIS
The critical intersections and road segments were analyzed based on the existing roadway conditions to
determine potential impacts and to investigate mitigation requirements.

Unsignalized Intersection Analysis
The unsignalized intersection was analyzed to determine the operational LOS at the time of build-out. Table 7

Table 7, the unsignalized intersection is expected to operate within an acceptable service level.

Signalized Intersection Analysis
The signalized intersection was analyzed to determine the operational LOS at the time of build-out. Table 8 shows
the projected LOS for the study intersections. The HCS summary sheet is located in Appendix H. As indicted in
Table 8, the signalized intersection is expected to operate within the adopted LOS under build-out conditions.

Roadway Segment Analysis
The traffic analysis for the roadway segments involves the comparison of the future peak-hour two-way volumes
to available capacity. Table 9 presents the results of the peak-hour, two-way road segment analysis for the study
area roadways under build-out conditions. As indicated in Table 9, the study area roadways are expected to
operate within an acceptable LOS under build-out conditions with the exception of Taylor Road from Williamson
Boulevard to I-95 and from Dunlawton Avenue to Clyde Morris Boulevard. These segments are within the study
area because they are deemed critical/near-critical. Please note that the project is not expected to impact these
segments due to sufficient similar uses within the project study area, as identified in the approved project trip
distribution.

Furthermore, rezoning of the subject property to allow the commercial use will result in a reduction in trips on
roadway links north of the site. The demand for residential-to-commercial trip making exists under current
conditions. The proposed zoning change is expected to create shopping opportunities within a residential area
that has limited services under existing conditions. Many residents who live in the vicinity of the project and
further south of the project must currently travel through the Taylor Road/Williamson Boulevard intersection to
satisfy frequent shopping needs. This particular intersection has been experiencing congestion over the last few
years and is within the critical segment of Taylor Road from Williamson Boulevard to I-95. The proposed zoning
change will provide neighborhood shopping opportunities for residents within the surrounding residential
communities, thereby reducing the total vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) and alleviating congestion on the
critical/near-critical roadway segments. To provide for a conservative analysis, no reduction in trips has been
accounted for in this analysis and the results still indicate that sufficient capacity is available to accommodate the
rezoning.

CONCLUSIONS
This study was conducted to evaluate the impact the proposed Pioneer Square BPUD rezoning will have on area
roadways in Volusia County. The results of the study are summarized below:

   x   The proposed rezoning is limited to a 75,000-sq. ft. shopping center which will be located in the northeast
       quadrant of the Airport Road/Pioneer Trail intersection in Volusia County.

   x   The proposed rezoning has the potential to generate 5,634 total daily trips with 381 net new p.m. peak-
       hour trips.

   x   The unsignalized intersection within the project study area is currently operating at an acceptable LOS in
       the p.m. peak-hour.

   x   Under build-out conditions, the unsignalized intersection within the project study area is expected to
       operate within the adopted level of service.

   x   The signalized intersection within the project study area is currently operating at an acceptable LOS in the
       p.m. peak hour.

   x   Under build-out conditions, the signalized intersection within the project study area is expected to operate
       within the adopted level of service.

   x   All roadways segments are currently operating within the adopted LOS.

   x   Under 2017 build-out conditions, all study roadway segments are expected to operate within the adopted
       levels of service.

   x   The proposed rezoning of the subject property will not adversely impact the transportation network within
       the project study area. Sufficient capacity is available to accommodate the potential impact.

   x   Please note that a more detailed TIA, also consistent with the County's adopted procedures, will be
       required prior to any site plan approval.

   Re: Pioneer Square ­Traffic Impact Analysis Methodology - Revised
       Volusia County, Florida

   Dear Mr. Cheney:

   Lassiter Transportation Group, Inc. (LTG) has been retained to prepare a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) to support
   an admendment to Volusia County's Zoning designation to change the zoning classification of the Pioneer Trail
   property. The proposed development is located in the northeast quadrant of the Pioneer Trail/Airport Road
   intersection and will include a 75,000 square-foot Shopping Center. Figure 1 shows the location of the project
   relative to the surrounding road network and Figure 2 shows the project in relation to a five-mile radius provided
   by Volusia County. Build-out of the development is anticipated by the end of 2016.

   REPORT FORMAT
   Four printed copies and one electronic version of the TIA will be submitted for review. The TIA will have a title
   page which will include the development name, the developer's name, company, address and phone number, the
   professional engineer's name, company, address and phone number and the TIA preparation date. A table of
   contents will be provided which lists the figures, tables, chapters and appendices. A completed TIA Submission
   Checklist, as provided by the County, will be submitted with the TIA report.

   TRIP GENERATION
   The trip generation for this development was determined using the trip generation rates published by the Institute
   of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in the document Trip Generation, 9th Edition. Table 1 shows the total daily and
   p.m. peak-hour trip generation.

   The TIA will also present the maximum trip generation potential under existing zoning. The existing zoning is A-1
   Prime Agriculture and allows up to one dwelling unit per 10 acres. Therefore, a maximum of one dwelling unit is
   permitted under the existing zoning designation. One dwelling unit equates to 10 daily trips and one p.m. peak-
   hour trip.

A portion of the trips, known as pass-by (limited to 14% of adjacent street traffic) will be attracted to the
development from the existing traffic on the adjacent roadways. These pass-by trips were calculated using the
procedures outlined in the Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition and deducted from the total trip generation
shown in Table 1 to determine the new external trips that the proposed development will add to the roadway
network. The resulting new external trip generation for the proposed development is shown in Table 2.

¹ Pass-by = 14% of adjacent street traffic.

It should be noted that the adjacent street traffic was obtained from p.m. peak-hour turning movement counts
conduted at the Airport Road/Pioneer Trail intersection. The projected 2016 two-way peak-hour counts for Airport
Road and Pioneer trail totaled to 1,020 trips; resulting in 143 total pass-by trips.

IMPACTED ROADWAYS/INTERSECTIONS
The Volusia Transportation Planning Organization (VTPO) TIA Guidelines require that the study area consist of
roadways within a five-mile radius on which project traffic is at least five percent of the peak-hour, two-way
capacity as well as roadways which are above 90 percent of their capacity that are impacted by project traffic.
Roadway classification was determined by the Urban Area Boundary for the southeast region obtained from the
VTPO Adjusted 2010 Census Map. Table 3 summarizes roadway segments which have been checked for
significance using the adopting guidelines. The significant segments are highlighted in Table 3. The critical/near-
critical roadways within the study area are identified with an asterisk and will be included in the future conditions
analysis for roadway segments per the County's request. Based on the criteria, the study area may include the
following intersections and roadway segments.
Roadway Segments:
x Airport Road from Williamson Boulevard to Pioneer Trail
x Pioneer Trail from Airport Road to Turnbull Bay Road
x Williamson Boulevard Extension from Airport Road to Pioneer Trail
x SR 421(Taylor Road) from Crane Lane Boulevard to Summertree Road*
x SR 421(Taylor Road) from Williamson Boulevard to I-95*
x SR 421 (Dunlawton Avenue) from I-95 to Taylor Branch Road
x Taylor Branch Road from SR 421 (Dunlawton Avenue) to Clyde Morris Boulevard*
*Critical/near critical roadway to be included in future conditions analysis

Intersections:
x     Pioneer Trail at Airport Road
x     Airport Road at Williamson Boulevard

ANALYSIS SCENARIOS
Existing Scenario
This includes the analysis of existing traffic on the existing network. The existing network includes all existing
roads, major roads under construction by a non-governmental party, plus all improvements for which construction
contracts have been executed by government agencies at the time the proposed transportation methodology
statement is initially submitted.

    intersections identified in the section titled IMPACTED ROADWAY/INTERSECTIONS.

    Level of Service (LOS)
    LOS will be analyzed for all site-access intersections and the major road segments and intersections included in
    the network defined by the IMPACTED ROADWAYS/INTERSECTIONS Section.

    Road Segment Analysis ­ P.M. Peak-Hour Two-Way
    Road segment volumes will be obtained from the most recently available roadway Volusia County segment
    counts. If the peak-hour two-way traffic is expected to exceed the maximum service volume of a roadway
    segment, a transportation analysis may be conducted to determine the service volume specific to that segment.
    The procedures documented in the latest version of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Quality
    Level of Service Handbook will be used to determine specific capacity.

Intersection Analysis ­ P.M. Peak-Hour
The operating conditions at the unsignalized intersection will be evaluated using the Highway Capacity Software
Version 6.41 (HCS). This software utilizes the methodology outlined in Chapter 19 of the 2010 Highway Capacity
Manual, titled "Two-Way Stop Controlled".

The operating conditions at the signalized intersection will be evaluated using the Highway Capacity Software
Version 6.41 (HCS). This software utilizes the methodology outlined in Chapter 18 of the 2010 Highway Capacity
Manual, titled "Signalized Intersections". HCS analysis at signalized intersections will be based upon existing
Signal Timing Plans provided by Volusia County. For any future HCS analysis at a signalized intersection the
minimum green time will be 8 seconds, unless otherwise approved by Volusia County Traffic Engineering.

DISTRIBUTION & TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT
Trip Distribution
As indicated in the IMPACTED ROADWAYS/INTERSECTIONS Section, traffic will be distributed along roadway
segments using the Central Florida Regional Planning Model (CFRPM) output calculated for the Methodology for
Rezoning Traffic Impact Study (TIS) previously submitted by Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. on November 21,
2008 and modified in discussion with County staff. The project distribution obtained from the previous study, that
will also be used as the basis for the updated analysis, is graphically illustrated in Figure 3. It should be noted that
per the County's request, an alternate model configuration was performed to include the future Williamson
Boulevard Extension. Based on the model output, less than one percent of project traffic is expected to utilize this
extension and therefore will not be used in the analysis. However, a background traffic diversion analysis will be
conducted using the model to determine how the future background traffic is effected by the Williamson Boulevard
Extension.

Trip Assignment
Using the total p.m. peak-hour trip generation and the trip distribution pattern, traffic will be assigned to the study
area roadways and intersections.

TRAFFIC COUNTS
Intersection turning movement counts (TMC) will be conducted on a typical weekday (Tuesday, Wednesday or
Thursday) from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. All TMCs used in the TIA will be less than one year old.

BACKGROUND TRAFFIC GROWTH/FUTURE TRAFFIC
The existing traffic counts will be increased by a growth factor determined using FDOT's Traffic Trends and the
last ten years of historical count data. All applied growth rates will be at least one percent. Historical growth rates
will be checked to ensure that they reasonably represent growth to the project build-out year and appropriately
adjusted where necessary. As noted by the County, vested trips will only be used for projecting future year traffic
if they are derived from a large project or DRI.

LOS STANDARDS
The LOS standards for all major road segments will be consistent with the letter standards per the VTPO adopted
Comprehensive Plan. The overall intersection LOS standard is the same as the segment standard except where
different segment LOS standards apply to different legs of the intersection, in which case the overall intersection
LOS standard will be the lowest crossing road standards.

MITIGATION OF IMPACTS
Appropriate roadway and intersection mitigation plans will be identified to adequately address any level of service
issues due to project impacts. Site access needs will be addressed.

If you have any questions or comments, please give me a call at 386.257.2571.

Re:      Pioneer Square ­ Traffic Impact Analysis Methodology
         Response to Comments

Dear Mr. Cheney:

Lassiter Transportation Group, Inc. (LTG) has provided responses for comments dated May 16th, 2013 regarding
the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) for the rezoning of the proposed Pioneer Square Shopping Center. The County's
comments are listed below in plain text with our responses in bold text.

      1.) Comment:       Advisory: The rezoning analysis is suppose to analyze the net trip difference between
                         the existing rezoning category and proposed zoning category. This review is generally
                         broader than a detailed TIA. Because the rezoning is a PUD, which is proposed to
                         represent the site's development plan, we suggest that a rezoning section be included
                         in with the TIA for the development plan in effort to save time and unnecessary work.

         Response:       Language will be added to the BPUD development agreement that limits the site
                         trip generation potential to the impacts that are analyzed in the TIA. This should
                         provide assurance to the County that the TIA included evaluation of maximum
                         impact based on the new zoning designation.

      2.) Comment:       Advisory: A 5-mile radius critical/near critical map is provided. Please include the critical
                         and near critical links in the maps/Figures 1 and 2.

         Response:       The 5-mile radius map provided will replace the previous 5-mile radius map
                         included in the original methodology letter. Critical and near-critical segments
                         have been included in the project study area. Please refer to the revised
                         Methodology letter attached.

      3.) Comment:       Advisory: Due to the parcel's development proposal history, we suggest that copies of
                         the analysis be shared with the cities of New Smyrna Beach and Port Orange.

         Response:       Will do.

      4.) Comment:       Impacted Roadways/Intersections/Page 4: Please add critical and near-critical
                         segments.

         Response:       See response to comment #2.

      5.) Comment:       An AM peak hour analysis should be considered since the site is within 1 mile of
                         Creekside Middle School.

         Response:       The project trip generation and potential impacts were evaluated to determine if

                   useful information can be obtained from an a.m. peak-hour analysis. The
                   Creekside Middle School bell schedule was reviewed and compared to the hourly
                   trip generation of a shopping center. The tardy bell rings at 8:56 a.m., which
                   suggests that the school traffic peaks between 8:00 a.m. ­ 9:00 a.m. Based on
                   the hourly trip generation of a shopping center, as presented in the ITE Trip
                   Generation Manual, 9th Edition (Volume 3, Page 1558, Table 1), only 4.3 percent of
                   an average shopping center's daily traffic occurs during this time period. Thus,
                   the potential for overlapping traffic is minimal.

                   Additionally, the project was evaluated for significance during the a.m. peak-hour.
                   The project is expected to generate 72 total a.m. peak-hour trips with only 47
                   being new trips (total trips ­ pass-by trips). The maximum a.m. peak-hour trip
                   assignment to Airport Road is 64 percent, which equates to 30 trips, yielding a
                   significance of 1.00 percent (30 / 2,990 = 1.00%). Given the information presented
                   above, please consider this request to omit the a.m. peak-hour analysis for this
                   commercial use.

   6.) Comment:    The Project Build-out year is 2018. The Williamson Blvd extension is anticipated to be
                   built by 2018; therefore, please analyze the Williamson Blvd extension to Pioneer Trail
                   in the future conditions.

      Response:    Please note that the anticipated build-out year of the project has been revised to
                   2016. However, as requested, the Williamson Boulevard extension will be
                   included in the future roadway analysis.

   7.) Comment:    Regarding the pass-by trips, the FDOT Site Impact Handbook suggests that the volume
                   of pass-by traffic not exceed 10% of the adjacent street volume during the peak hour.
                   For this segment of Airport Road, 10% of the peak hour volume is 54 vehicles. Table 2
                   shows 169 pass-by trips.

      Response:    The County has historically accepted a pass-by capture limit of 14 percent of the
                   adjacent street traffic. This is documented on page 8 of the adopted TIA
                   Guidelines. The project pass-by capture will be limited to 14 percent of the
                   adjacent street traffic under build-out conditions.

   8.) Comment:    Table 4: Please provide how the Peak-Hour Two-Way Capacities were derived. Also, a
                   column indicating whether the road segment is urban, transitioning or rural area should
                   be provided to assist with review of this table.

      Response:    A column for area type has been added to Table 3. The area types were
                   determined using the recently adopted FHWA Urban Area Boundaries. The
                   capacities were assigned based on FDOT's 2012 LOS Tables.

   9.) Comment:    Intersection Analysis: The intersection of Airport Road/Pioneer Trail is now an all-way
                   stop. The Methodology should state that the all-way stop condition will also be analyzed
                   in the future conditions in addition to analyzing it as a signalized intersection.

      Response:    Noted.

   10.) Comment:   Future Scenario/Page 6: Historical growth rates should be calculated for each segment
                   using either Traffic Trends software of those rates provided by the vTIMAS
                                                                                                 Page 127 of 201

                          spreadsheet. The vTIMAS spreadsheet is attached. Please utilize the past 10 years (as
                          opposed to 5) in the determination of historical growth rates.

        Response:         Will do.

    11.) Comment:         Advisory: Volusia County doesn't use vested trips for projecting future year traffic unless
                          they are derived from a very large project or DRI. As such, growth rates are obtained by
                          using those rates provided in the vTIMAS spreadsheet. The county will accept a
                          minimum 1% growth per year, if able to be supported with documentation. Note that the
                          vTIMAS is in the midst of being updated with 2012 counts along with the new 2012
                          FDOT LOS Handbook calculations; therefore, the vTIMAS spreadsheet will not reflect
                          2012 adopted levels of service.

        Response:         Noted.

                             EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


I. Introduction

The Town of Davidson is currently conducting a parking study examining the
existing parking layout and usage throughout the Town as well as the future
parking needs and strategies to service the Town. This report examines the
existing and future traffic flows that access the Town's parking. Figure ES-1
shows the general site location of the Town and the intersections analyzed as
part of the study. The analysis area is bound by SR 2158 (Griffith Street) to the
north, SR 2733 (Jackson Street) to the west, NC 115 (Main Street) to the south
and east, and includes the intersection of SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan Street.
This report analyzes the 2011 existing year traffic conditions, the no-build
condition for 2020, 2020 traffic with the construction of the Potts Street / Sloan
Street connection, 2020 traffic with the construction of a potential 300 space
parking deck accessing Jackson Street, 2020 traffic with a potential 300 space
parking deck accessing Depot Street, and 2020 traffic with a potential 300 space
parking deck accessing Griffith Street.

Each of the proposed parking deck sites are currently developed. There are two
potential parking deck sites on Jackson Street; one is currently a surface parking
lot behind the existing post office and the second site is the two Town lots
adjacent to the Fire Hall. The third potential site is the Depot Street parking deck
location and is currently the Metrolina development or undeveloped land across
the street from the Metrolina site. The fourth potential site is currently the parking
lot for the Saddlers Square development off of Griffith Street. Figure ES-2
shows the location of the four proposed sites for potential parking decks as well
as the potential Potts-Sloan connection.

This report analyzes and presents the traffic impacts that alternate parking
strategies will have on the existing intersections:

       ·   SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan Street
       ·   SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street)
       ·   NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street)
       ·   SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / Depot Street
       ·   NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2693 (Concord Road)
       ·   NC 115 (Main Street) / South Street / Chairman Blake Lane
       ·   NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson Street)

II. Base Conditions

Currently there are four signalized intersections and three unsignalized
intersections in the project study area. The intersections of SR 2158 (Griffith
Street) / Sloan Street, NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street), NC 115

                                                   Town of Davidson Parking Study
                                                                  Traffic Analysis

(Main Street) / SR 2693 (Concord Road), and NC-115 (Main Street) / Chairman
Blake Lane / South Street are currently signalized. The intersections of SR 2733
(Jackson Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street), SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / Depot
Street, and NC-115 (Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson St) are currently
unsignalized.

Currently, there are two Charlotte Area Transit (CATS) bus routes located in the
vicinity of this project (77X and 97). Bus stops are in various locations along
Griffith Street and NC 115 (Main Street). Sidewalk exists along many of the
study area corridors and many area intersections include both crosswalks and
pedestrian actuation. There are on-street provisions for area bicyclists along
Griffith Street with a number of area bicyclists. In order to provide a more
conservative future vehicle estimate, no adjustments were made to anticipated
traffic volumes to account for alternative modes of transportation or transit use.
However, due to the nature of downtown Davidson, the proximity of Davidson
College, and availability of area on-street parking, it is anticipated that a large
percentage of trips within the downtown region are due to non-motorized activity
or transit.

Supplemented by traffic data provided by the Town of Davidson, traffic counts
were conducted by SEPI Engineering & Construction during the AM and PM
peak hours of a typical weekday. These counts were used to analyze existing
conditions as well as projecting future conditions.

Accident data for the past four year period (2007-2010) was provided by the
NCDOT. An accident summary has been included for the seven existing study
area intersections. Each of the studied intersections had a low number of
reported accidents over the past four years with the most occurring at NC-115
(Main Street) / SR 2693 (Concord Road) (15 accidents). All of the other
intersections had a total of 5 accidents or less reported over the past four years.
Though it would be ideal if an intersection were accident free, the small number
of accidents (and overall low occurrence of injuries) at each of these
intersections reveals that each intersection is operating relatively safely. No
recommendations are proposed based upon the number of reported intersection
accidents.

The signalized intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) / South Street / Chairman
Blake Lane is currently operating at LOS F during both peak hours of Condition
1. Additionally, the northbound shared movement at the intersection of SR 2733
(Jackson Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street) is operating at a LOS E during the PM
peak hour. All other intersections (signalized) and intersection movements
(unsignalized) are currently operating at acceptable levels of service during the
2011 AM and PM peak hours. Each analysis was conducted using the existing
geometric configuration, existing traffic volumes, and existing signal timings.

III. Background Conditions

There are currently no approved future developments in the project study area
that will generate additional background traffic. To account for area-wide 2020
ambient traffic growth, an annual growth rate percentage of 2.5 percent per year
was applied to the existing volumes. This growth rate was calculated using area
1998-2008 AADT values. It should be noted that, due to the long range forecast
of traffic growth, it was assumed that 2020 future peak hour factors would equal
0.90.

There are currently no TIP projects scheduled for completion in the project study
area. Because of this, no changes will be made to the existing lane configuration
prior to the 2020 build-out year; therefore, analyses for Conditions 1 ­ 6 will use
the existing lane configuration.

The signalized intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) / South Street / Chairman
Blake Lane is projected to operate at LOS F during both peak hours of Condition
2 and the intersection of SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan Street is projected to
operate at a LOS F during the Condition 2 PM peak hour. Additionally, the
northbound shared movement at the intersection of SR 2733 (Jackson Street) /
SR 2158 (Griffith Street) is projected to operate at a LOS F during the AM and
PM peak hours and the southbound shared movement at intersection of NC 115
(Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson Street) is projected to operate at a LOS F
during the Condition 2 PM peak hour. All other intersections (signalized) and
intersection movements (unsignalized) are projected to operate at acceptable
levels of service during the 2020 Condition 2 AM and PM peak hours. Each
analysis was conducted using the existing geometric configuration and future
2020 without site traffic volumes.


IV. Project Conditions

Four future build conditions were analyzed for this project. The first condition
examined the potential connection between Potts Street and Sloan Street or the
Potts / Sloan connector. The Connector will provide an alternate route for traffic
wishing to travel north or south of the Town of Davidson. The Connector will run
parallel to existing NC 115 (Main Street) and offer a "relief valve" for those
vehicles wishing to bypass the peak hour delays and congestions. The second,
third, and fourth conditions involve the potential construction of a 300 space
parking deck that could potentially be located on one of four sites on SR 2733
(Jackson Street), Depot Street, and SR 2158 (Griffith Street) respectively. Either
of the sites located along SR 2733 (Jackson Street) will add additional parking for
downtown businesses helping to ease the projected future parking deficit where
the Depot Street and SR 2158 (Griffith Street) parking decks will provide
additional parking for commuter traffic wishing to use area transit.

Trip generation for the Potts / Sloan Connector was determined using data from
the CMAQ Funds application completed for the Town of Davidson. Synchro 7
data from the CMAQ Funds application revealed that approximately 10% of traffic
was re-routed from NC 115 (Main Street) onto the Potts / Sloan connector at the
intersections of NC 115 (Main Street) / Sloan Street and Potts Street / NC 115
(Main Street) (the northern and southern terminus intersections). For the sake of
analysis it was assumed that 10% of the 2010 traffic (AM and PM peak hours)
would be re-routed from NC-115 (Main Street) onto the Potts / Sloan Connector.
The 2010 re-routed vehicles were grown at an exponential growth rate of 2.5%
for 10 years to determine 2020 re-routed volumes. As previously discussed, the
2.5% growth rate was based on historic AADT values for the Davidson County.
The 2020 re-routed vehicles were subtracted from each of the study area
intersections along NC 115 (Main Street) to account for the decrease in traffic
due to the Potts / Sloan Connector. These subtracted volumes were added to
the north and southbound approaches at the intersection of SR 2158 (Griffith
Street) / Sloan Street. The re-routed northbound traffic volume was split between
the left-turn and through movements to account for vehicles wishing to access I-
77 or bypass the Town (respectively). The re-routed southbound traffic was
added solely to through movement as any traffic wishing to perform a left
(towards Davidson) or right-turning (towards I-77) movement can currently
perform either movement with or without the construction of the Connector.

The trip generation for each potential parking deck scenario was determined
using the ITE Trip Generation Manual (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 8th
Edition, 2008). Due to the location of the two potential sites for a parking deck,
Land Use Code 090 (Park-and-Ride Lot with Bus Service) and the number of
parking spaces (300) was used to estimate the total peak hour and average daily
traffic volumes for the Depot Street and SR 2158 (Griffith Street) parking decks.
Following the NCDOT procedures for use of the ITE Trip Generation Manual, trip
generation results were determined using the provided equation for each office
land use type. Trips generated by the Depot Street and SR 2158 (Griffith Street)
potential parking site locations totaled 167 and 39 in-coming and out-going AM
peak hour trips (respectively) and 42 and 141 in-coming and out-going PM peak
hour trips (respectively).

The trip generation for the two SR 2733 (Jackson Street) potential parking site
locations was determined using the ITE Trip Generation Manual (Institute of
Transportation Engineers, 8th Edition, 2008). Due to the locations of these two
potential deck sites and surrounding land uses, Land Use Codes 710 (General
Office Building) and 820 (Shopping Center) were used to estimate the total peak
hour and average daily traffic volumes. SEPI used the 2020 parking deficiency
of 231 vehicles to calculate the trip generation for the proposed parking deck
(Rich and Associates). For the sake of calculation, it was assumed that traffic
accessing the parking deck during the AM peak hour would function similarly to
traffic accessing an office development. Using the 231 vehicle deficiency as the
entering volume and the 88% entering directional distribution from Land Use

Code 710, a total AM peak hour volume and AM peak hour exiting volume was
calculated. It was assumed that traffic accessing either of the potential sites for
the parking deck during the PM peak hour would function similarly to traffic
accessing a shopping center development. Using the 231 vehicle deficiency as
the entering volume and the 49% entering directional distribution from Land Use
Code 820, a total PM peak hour volume and PM peak hour exiting volume was
calculated. Trips generated by either of the SR 2733 (Jackson Street) parking
deck options totaled 231 and 32 in-coming and out-going AM peak hour trips
(respectively) and 231 and 240 in-coming and out-going PM peak hour trips
(respectively).

The directional traffic patterns, or trip distribution, of the site-generated traffic for
the Potts / Sloan connector was determined using Davidson CMAQ Funds
Application. It was assumed, for the purpose of this study, that traffic re-routed
from NC 115 (Main Street) was applied to the intersection of SR 2158 (Griffith
Street) / Sloan Street. All re-routed northbound traffic was split between the
northbound left-turn / through movements of the SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan
Street intersection where all re-routed southbound traffic was added solely to the
southbound through movement.

Area trip distribution for the four potential parking deck locations or options is
based on traffic counts performed by SEPI in December 2010 and traffic volumes
provided by the CMAQ study (collected in 2010). Total trips into and out of the
study area using SR 2158 (Griffith Street), SR 2733 (Jackson Street), Beatty
Street / Sloan Street, Depot Street, NC 115 (Main Street), SR 2693 (Concord
Road), South Street, and Chairman Blake Lane form the basis for the percentage
distribution. Distribution percentages into and out of the study area are calculated
using the existing traffic volumes entering and exiting the study area. This
distribution percentage is then applied to the generated trips to predict routes and
project traffic volumes for the three 2020 parking deck scenarios.

V. Conclusions and Recommendations

In conclusion, SEPI analyzed the existing and five future conditions for the
Davidson Parking Study:

     Condition 2: 2020 Without Site Traffic
     Condition 3: 2020 With Site Traffic Potts-Sloan Connection
     Condition 4: 2020 With Site Traffic Jackson Street 300 Space Parking Deck
     Condition 5: 2020 With Site Traffic Depot Street 300 Space Parking Deck
     Condition 6: 2020 With Site Traffic Griffith Street 300 Space Parking Deck

Based on the analyses conducted, three intersections will require
improvements due to future 2020 traffic projections. Improvements are required
at the intersections of SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan Street, SR 2733 (Jackson
Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street), and NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson

Street) to allow each intersection to operate acceptably during the 2020 future
year. Using Condition 4 traffic volumes as a "worst-case" traffic scenario, the
intersection of SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan Street will require the addition of
second westbound through lane as well as modification to the intersection
phasing. Signalization will be required at the intersections of SR 2733 (Jackson
Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street) and NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson
Street) in order for both to operate acceptably during both 2020 peak hours. All
other intersections (signalized) and intersection movements (unsignalized) are
projected to operate acceptable during both 2020 peak hours.

I. Introduction

A. Project Explanation

The Town of Davidson is currently conducting a parking study examining the
existing parking layout and usage throughout the Town as well as the future
parking needs and strategies to service the Town. This report examines the
existing and future traffic flows that access the Town's parking. Figure 1
(located in Appendix A) shows the general site location of the Town and the
intersections analyzed as part of the study. The analysis area is bound by SR
2158 (Griffith Street) to the north, SR 2733 (Jackson Street) to the west, NC 115
(Main Street) to the south and east, and includes the intersection of SR 2158
(Griffith Street) / Sloan Street. This report analyzes the 2011 existing year traffic
conditions, the no-build condition for 2020, 2020 traffic with the construction of
the Potts Street / Sloan Street connection, 2020 traffic with the construction of a
potential 300 space parking deck accessing Jackson Street, 2020 traffic with a
potential 300 space parking deck accessing Depot Street, and 2020 traffic with a
potential 300 space parking deck accessing Griffith Street.

Each of the proposed parking deck sites are currently developed. There are two
potential parking deck sites on Jackson Street; one is currently a surface parking
lot behind the existing post office and the second site is the two Town lots
adjacent to the Fire Hall. The third potential site is the Depot Street parking deck
location and is currently the Metrolina development or undeveloped land across
the street from the Metrolina site. The fourth potential site is currently the parking
lot for the Saddlers Square development off of Griffith Street. Figure 2 shows
the location of the four proposed sites for potential parking decks as well as the
potential Potts-Sloan connection.

B. Project Description

This report analyzes and presents the traffic impacts that alternate parking
strategies will have on the existing intersections:

       ·   SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan Street
       ·   SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street)
       ·   NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street)
       ·   SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / Depot Street
       ·   NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2693 (Concord Road)
       ·   NC 115 (Main Street) / South Street / Chairman Blake Lane
       ·   NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson Street)

The impacts of the proposed parking alternatives at these intersections will be
evaluated during the AM and PM peak hours of an average weekday. The
following analysis is based on the 2010 existing year traffic, the 2020 traffic with
the addition of ambient growth, the 2020 total traffic with the construction of the

Potts-Sloan connection, the 2020 total traffic with the addition of the estimated
site-generated traffic produced by the parking alternatives, and the future year
2020 total traffic with the addition of recommended roadway improvements.
Currently there are no approved developments in the study area that will
generate additional background traffic. To account for area-wide 2020 ambient
traffic growth, an annual growth rate percentage of 2.5 percent per year was
applied to the existing volumes. This growth rate was calculated using area 1998
­ 2008 AADT values provided by the NCDOT.

The capacity analysis methodology is provided by the 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM 2000). Using these methods, a level of service (LOS) is
determined. Level of service is the measure that rates traffic conditions
qualitatively based on the observed and collected data for the given
transportation facility. The traffic operations optimization and evaluation software
Synchro Version 7.0 was used to evaluate the existing and proposed
unsignalized and signalized intersections.


II. Base Conditions

A. Geometrics and Traffic Control

Roadways

NC 115 (Main Street) is a North Carolina highway that runs approximately
northeast ­ southwest along the eastern edge of the project study area. In the
project study area NC 115 (Main Street) is a two-lane facility, with additional turn-
lanes at major intersections, and includes signalized intersections with SR 2158
(Griffith Street), SR 2693 (Concord Road), and Chairman Blake lane / South
Street. Additionally, NC 115 (Main Street) has an unsignalized intersection with
SR 2733 (Jackson Street). The facility primarily services commercial and office
developments in the project study area and includes on-street parking in several
locations. This facility has a posted 25-mph speed limit north of SR 2158 (Griffith
Street), a 20-mph speed limit south of SR 2158 (Griffith Street), and a 25-mph
speed limit west of SR 2733 (Jackson Street). Parallel and angled on-street
parking lines both sides of the facility from SR 2158 (Griffith Street) to SR 2733
(Jackson Street).

Due to its location, NC 115 (Main Street) often serves as both a relief valve and
an alternate route to I-77 when the facility is over-congested or has experienced
lane closures. When these scenarios occur, this additional traffic has gridlocked
the Town. Not only has this gridlock hampered parking and hurt area
businesses, but it severely hinders emergency vehicle mobility and access.

SR 2733 (Jackson Street) is a moderately travelled facility that runs
approximately northeast ­ southwest along the western edge of the project study


                                         2

Intersections

Currently there are four signalized intersections and three unsignalized
intersections in the project study area. The intersections of SR 2158 (Griffith
Street) / Sloan Street, NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street), NC 115
(Main Street) / SR 2693 (Concord Road), and NC-115 (Main Street) / Chairman
Blake Lane / South Street are currently signalized. The intersections of SR 2733
(Jackson Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street), SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / Depot
Street, and NC-115 (Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson St) are currently
unsignalized. Figure 3 shows the existing lane configurations and traffic control
for each intersection.

The intersection of SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan Street is a signalized
intersection with a two-phase traffic signal. The north and southbound lane
configurations include a single shared left / through / right-turn lane. The east and
westbound lane configurations consist of an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared
through / right-turn lane. A bike lane parallels SR 2158 (Griffith Street), but no
specific signal timing or phasing is including for bicyclists. The intersection
includes pedestrian crosswalks (and actuation) for the southern and western
intersections legs. On-street parking lines SR 2158 (Griffith Street) to the south.
Figure 3 shows the existing lane configuration at this intersection.

The intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street) is a
signalized intersection with a four-phase traffic signal including split side street
phasing and a protected / permitted northbound left-turn phase. The northbound
lane configuration consists of an exclusive left-turn lane and a through lane. The
southbound lane configuration includes a single shared through / right-turn lane.
The east and westbound side street approaches consist of exclusive left right-
turn lanes. The intersection includes pedestrian crosswalks for the southern and
western intersections legs. On-street parking lines SR 2158 (Griffith Street) and
NC 115 (Main Street). Figure 3 shows the existing lane configuration at this
intersection.

The intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2693 (Concord Road) is a
signalized intersection with a three-phase traffic signal including a protected /
permitted southbound left-turn phase. The northbound lane configuration

consists of an exclusive through lane as well as an exclusive right-turn lane. The
southbound lane configuration consists of a single shared through / left-turn lane.
The westbound lane configuration consists of exclusive left and right-turn lanes.
The intersection includes pedestrian crosswalks (and actuation) crossing all three
intersections legs. On-street parallel parking lines both facilities with on-street
angled parking spaces in the southeast intersection quadrant. Figure 3 shows
the existing lane configuration at this intersection.

The intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) / South Street / Chairman Blake Lane is
controlled by a four-phase traffic signal with split side street phases for South
Street and Chairman Blake Lane. The southbound NC 115 (Main Street) lane
configuration consists of an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared through / right-
turn lane. The north, east, and westbound lane configurations each consist of a
single shared left / through / right-turn lane. The intersection includes pedestrian
crosswalks (and actuation) crossing all four intersection legs. On-street parallel
parking lines each facility. Figure 3 shows the existing lane configuration at this
intersection.

The unsignalized intersection SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith
Street) is a two-way stop-controlled intersection with the Jackson Street
approaches encountering the stopped condition. Each of the four approaches
include a single shared left / through / right-turn lane. Parallel on-street parking is
permitted along both SR 2733 (Jackson Street) and SR 2158 (Griffith Street).
The intersection includes a striped pedestrian crosswalk crossing the eastern
intersection leg. Figure 3 shows the existing lane configuration at this
intersection.

The unsignalized intersection SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / Depot Street is a four-
way stop-controlled intersection. Each of the four approaches include a single
shared left / through / right-turn lane. On-street parking is permitted along the
southern side of Depot Street as well as along both sides of SR 2733 (Jackson
Street). The intersection does not include pedestrian crosswalks. Figure 3
shows the existing lane configuration at this intersection.

The unsignalized intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson
Street) is a stop-controlled intersection with the Jackson Street approach
encountering the stopped condition. The southbound lane configuration consists
of a single shared left / right-turn lane. The eastbound lane configuration
consists of a shared through / left-turn lane. The westbound lane configuration
consists of a shared though / right-turn lane. The intersection does not include
pedestrian crosswalks. Parallel parking lines SR 2733 (Jackson Street) and the
north side of NC 115 (Main Street). Figure 3 shows the existing lane
configuration at this intersection.

B. Alternate Modes of Transportation / Transit Impacts

Currently, there are two Charlotte Area Transit (CATS) bus routes located in the
vicinity of this project (77X and 97). Bus stops are in various locations along
Griffith Street and NC 115 (Main Street). Sidewalk exists along many of the
study area corridors and many area intersections include both crosswalks and
pedestrian actuation. There are on-street provisions for area bicyclists along
Griffith Street with a number of area bicyclists. In order to provide a more
conservative future vehicle estimate, no adjustments were made to anticipated
traffic volumes to account for alternative modes of transportation or transit use.
However, due to the nature of downtown Davidson, the proximity of Davidson
College, and availability of area on-street parking, it is anticipated that a large
percentage of trips within the downtown region are due to non-motorized activity
or transit.

C. Existing Traffic Volumes

Figure 4 shows the existing AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes for the study
area intersections. The counts used to determine these volumes (see Appendix
B) were conducted by SEPI Engineering & Construction for the following
intersections during the respective times listed in Table 1 below:

D. Existing Signal Phasing / Timing Information

Signal phasing and timing information for each of the signalized intersections is
located in Appendix C. Existing signal plans for the traffic signals were obtained
from the NCDOT Signals Design Section. Information from the plans related to
signal timing minimums and phasing sequences were used for all conditions in
this analysis. Currently all four signals are fully actuated.

E. Area Safety Review

Accident data for the past four year period (2007-2010) was provided by the
NCDOT. An accident summary (provided in Appendix D) has been included for
the seven existing study area intersections. Table 2 below summarizes the
number of accidents, type of accident (injury or property damage), and year of
occurrence for each intersection. As shown in Table 2, each of the studied
intersections had a low number of reported accidents over the past four years
with the most occurring at NC-115 (Main Street) / SR 2693 (Concord Road) (15
accidents). All of the other intersections had a total of 5 accidents or less
reported over the past four years. Though it would be ideal if an intersection
were accident free, the small number of accidents (and overall low occurrence of
injuries) at each of these intersections reveals that each intersection is operating
relatively safely. No recommendations are proposed based upon the number of
reported intersection accidents.

F. Traffic Capacity Analysis

The capacity of a roadway is measured by the "level of service" it provides, as
described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board,
2000). Level of service (LOS) is a measure used to describe the operating
conditions of traffic on a roadway based on characteristics such as speed, traffic
volumes, geometric configuration, delays, and freedom to maneuver. Levels of
service range from "A" to "F," with "A" describing smooth free flow conditions, and
"F" describing congested, over-saturated and forced flow conditions, where stop-
and-go waves are common. Other factors, such as a high percentage of trucks
or buses within the traffic stream can affect level of service. The roadway
setting, whether it is urban, suburban, or rural, can also affect level of service.
For signalized intersections in urban areas, LOS D is generally considered
acceptable, while in rural areas, LOS C is considered acceptable.

At unsignalized intersections, a LOS E is generally considered acceptable if only
the side street encounters delay. Nevertheless, side streets typically function at
a LOS F during peak traffic periods, because the traffic volumes often do not
warrant a traffic signal to assist side street traffic. Table 3 below provides a
general description of the various levels of service categories and delay ranges:

       B              Short traffic delay         10-20 seconds      10-15 seconds
       C            Average traffic delay         20-35 seconds      15-25 seconds
       D              Long traffic delay          35-55 seconds      25-35 seconds
       E            Very long traffic delay       55-80 seconds      35-50 seconds
       F             Unacceptable delay           > 80 seconds        > 50 seconds

The following four conditions were evaluated for this analysis:

     Condition 1: 2011 Existing Traffic
     Condition 2: 2020 Without Site Traffic
     Condition 3: 2020 With Site Traffic Potts-Sloan Connection
     Condition 4: 2020 With Site Traffic Jackson Street 300 Space Parking Deck
     Condition 5: 2020 With Site Traffic Depot Street 300 Space Parking Deck
     Condition 6: 2020 With Site Traffic Griffith Street 300 Space Parking Deck

The analysis results for unsignalized intersections were found using Synchro
Version 7.0 through the use of procedures described in the HCM 2000. To
obtain optimized signal timings and analysis results for the signalized
intersections at SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan Street, NC 115 (Main Street) /

NC-115 (Main Street) / Chairman Blake Lane / South Street, the timing
optimization software Synchro Version 7.0 was used.

Synchro was used to analyze all unsignalized intersections. Because overall
intersection levels of service are not provided for one or two-way stop controlled
unsignalized intersections (overall intersection levels of service are provided for
four-way stop controlled intersections), the results were evaluated on a per-
movement basis. Thus, intersection improvements may need to be considered
should one or more of the intersection movements experience a failing level of
service. This methodology differs from signalized intersections, where one or
more movement at an intersection may be deficient, but no intersection
improvements would be deemed necessary as long as the overall intersection
level of service does not fall below LOS D.

For Condition 1 the existing cycle lengths and split timings of the individual
signalized intersection were used initially and LOS and delay values from
Synchro 7.0 (using HCM delay formulas) were reported. If necessary, green split
timings were adjusted to allow the overall intersection to operate at LOS D, or
better.

Appendix E contains the Synchro output for this analysis. Table 4 below shows
the results of the intersection analyses for the 2011 Existing Conditions.

   Table 4 above reveals that the signalized intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) /
   South Street / Chairman Blake Lane is currently operating at LOS F during both
   peak hours of Condition 1. Additionally, the northbound shared movement at the
   intersection of SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street) is operating
   at a LOS E during the PM peak hour. All other intersections (signalized) and
   intersection movements (unsignalized) are currently operating at acceptable

levels of service during the 2011 AM and PM peak hours. Each analysis was
conducted using the existing geometric configuration, existing traffic volumes
(see Figure 4), and existing signal timings.

It should be noted, although Synchro projects that the intersection of NC 115
(Main Street) / South Street / Chairman Blake Lane is currently operating at LOS
F during both peak hours, SimTraffic simulations reveal otherwise (see Section
IV D below). It is believed that limitations in the Synchro program provide
incorrect delays and levels of service in this case. Synchro requires the
southbound through movement to be coded as a right-turning movement and the
northbound through movement to be coded as a left-turning movement. With a
single northbound through lane and volumes of 189 during the AM peak hour and
356 during the PM peak hour, Synchro programming will require additional left-
turn capacity and storage prior to calculating an acceptable level of service or
delay value.


III. Background Conditions

A. Background Traffic / Approved Developments

There are currently no approved future developments in the project study area
that will generate additional background traffic. To account for area-wide 2020
ambient traffic growth, an annual growth rate percentage of 2.5 percent per year
was applied to the existing volumes. This growth rate was calculated using area
1998-2008 AADT values. Appendix F shows the calculations for the area
growth factor. Figure 5 includes the 2020 Condition 2 traffic volumes. It should
be noted that, due to the long range forecast of traffic growth, it was assumed
that 2020 future peak hour factors would equal 0.90.

B. TIP Projects

There are currently no TIP projects scheduled for completion in the project study
area. Because of this, no changes will be made to the existing lane configuration
prior to the 2020 build-out year; therefore, analyses for Conditions 1 ­ 6 will use
the existing lane configuration.

C. Traffic Capacity Analysis

As previously mentioned, unsignalized intersections and signalized intersections
were analyzed using Synchro Version 7.0. Unsignalized results were evaluated
on a per-movement basis, since Synchro does not produce an overall
intersection level of service for unsignalized intersection. However, for signalized
intersections, a single LOS is obtained. For Condition 2, the cycle lengths and
splits of the signalized intersection are optimized in Synchro to allow the overall
intersection to operate at LOS D, or better, if possible. The Condition 1 cycle

lengths and green splits were reused if the analyzed intersection is projected to
operate acceptably.

A summary of the resulting LOS and delay values for the unsignalized (individual
movements) and signalized intersections (overall and individual movements) of
Condition 2 (Without Site Traffic Volumes) are shown in Table 5 below. The
outputs for each intersection obtained from Synchro Version 7.0 are located in

during the AM and PM peak hours and the southbound shared movement at
intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson Street) is projected to
operate at a LOS F during the Condition 2 PM peak hour. All other intersections
(signalized) and intersection movements (unsignalized) are projected to operate
at acceptable levels of service during the 2020 Condition 2 AM and PM peak
hours. Each analysis was conducted using the existing geometric configuration
and future 2020 without site traffic volumes (see Figure 5).


IV. Project Conditions

A. Trip Generation

Four future build conditions were analyzed for this project. The first condition
examined the potential connection between Potts Street and Sloan Street or the
Potts / Sloan connector. The Connector will provide an alternate route for traffic
wishing to travel north or south of the Town of Davidson. The Connector will run
parallel to existing NC 115 (Main Street) and offer a "relief valve" for those
vehicles wishing to bypass the peak hour delays and congestions. The second,
third, and fourth conditions involve the potential construction of a 300 space
parking deck that could potentially be located on one of four sites, on SR 2733
(Jackson Street), Depot Street, and SR 2158 (Griffith Street) respectively (see
Figure 2). Either of the sites located along SR 2733 (Jackson Street) will add
additional parking for downtown businesses helping to ease the projected future
parking deficit where the Depot Street and SR 2158 (Griffith Street) parking
decks will provide additional parking for commuter traffic wishing to use area
transit.

Trip generation for the Potts / Sloan Connector was determined using data from
the CMAQ Funds application completed for the Town of Davidson. Synchro 7
data from the CMAQ Funds application revealed that approximately 10% of traffic
was re-routed from NC 115 (Main Street) onto the Potts / Sloan connector at the
intersections of NC 115 (Main Street) / Sloan Street and Potts Street / NC 115
(Main Street) (the northern and southern terminus intersections). For the sake of
analysis it was assumed that 10% of the 2010 traffic (AM and PM peak hours)
would be re-routed from NC-115 (Main Street) onto the Potts / Sloan Connector.
The 2010 re-routed vehicles were grown at an exponential growth rate of 2.5%
for 10 years to determine 2020 re-routed volumes. As previously discussed, the
2.5% growth rate was based on historic AADT values for the Davidson County.
The 2020 re-routed vehicles were subtracted from each of the study area
intersections along NC 115 (Main Street) to account for the decrease in traffic
due to the Potts / Sloan Connector. These subtracted volumes were added to
the north and southbound approaches at the intersection of SR 2158 (Griffith
Street) / Sloan Street. The re-routed northbound traffic volume was split between
the left-turn and through movements to account for vehicles wishing to access I-
77 or bypass the Town (respectively). The re-routed southbound traffic was

added solely to through movement as any traffic wishing to perform a left
(towards Davidson) or right-turning (towards I-77) movement can currently
perform either movement with or without the construction of the Connector.

The trip generation for each potential parking deck scenario was determined
using the ITE Trip Generation Manual (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 8th
Edition, 2008). Due to the location of the two potential sites for a parking deck,
Land Use Code 090 (Park-and-Ride Lot with Bus Service) and the number of
parking spaces (300) was used to estimate the total peak hour and average daily
traffic volumes for the Depot Street and SR 2158 (Griffith Street) parking decks.
Following the NCDOT procedures for use of the ITE Trip Generation Manual, trip
generation results were determined using the provided equation for each office
land use type. Trips generated by the Depot Street and SR 2158 (Griffith Street)
potential parking site locations totaled 167 and 39 in-coming and out-going AM
peak hour trips (respectively) and 42 and 141 in-coming and out-going PM peak
hour trips (respectively).

The trip generation for either of the SR 2733 (Jackson Street) potential parking
site locations was determined using the ITE Trip Generation Manual (Institute of
Transportation Engineers, 8th Edition, 2008). Due to the location of the proposed
deck and surrounding land uses, Land Use Codes 710 (General Office Building)
and 820 (Shopping Center) were used to estimate the total peak hour and
average daily traffic volumes. SEPI used the 2020 parking deficiency of 231
vehicles to calculate the trip generation for the proposed parking deck (Rich and
Associates ­ See Appendix G). For the sake of calculation, it was assumed that
traffic accessing the parking deck during the AM peak hour would function
similarly to traffic accessing an office development. Using the 231 vehicle
deficiency as the entering volume and the 88% entering directional distribution
from Land Use Code 710, a total AM peak hour volume and AM peak hour
exiting volume was calculated. It was assumed that traffic accessing the parking
deck during the PM peak hour would function similarly to traffic accessing a
shopping center development. Using the 231 vehicle deficiency as the entering
volume and the 49% entering directional distribution from Land Use Code 820, a
total PM peak hour volume and PM peak hour exiting volume was calculated.
Trips generated by the SR 2733 (Jackson Street) parking deck totaled 231 and
32 in-coming and out-going AM peak hour trips (respectively) and 231 and 240
in-coming and out-going PM peak hour trips (respectively).

Table 6 summarizes the estimated traffic generation for the 2020 Conditions 4 ­
6 during the AM and PM peak hours as well as during an average weekday. Due
to the land use type, no attempt was made to reduce the number of trips by a
pass-by or internal capture factor. Additionally no attempt was made to reduce
the number of trips by a transit factor (due to the lengthy bus routes headways)
or other alternate form of transportation. A truck percentage of two percent was
used for all site-generated traffic.

B. Trip Distribution

The directional traffic patterns, or trip distribution, of the site-generated traffic for
the Potts / Sloan connector was determined using Davidson CMAQ Funds
Application. It was assumed, for the purpose of this study, that traffic re-routed
from NC 115 (Main Street) was applied to the intersection of SR 2158 (Griffith
Street) / Sloan Street. All re-routed northbound traffic was split between the
northbound left-turn / through movements of the SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan
Street intersection where all re-routed southbound traffic was added solely to the
southbound through movement. Site trip volumes for the Potts / Sloan
Connector can be found in Figure 6.

Area trip distribution for the four potential parking deck sites is based on traffic
counts performed by SEPI in December 2010 and traffic volumes provided by the
CMAQ study (collected in 2010). Total trips into and out of the study area using
SR 2158 (Griffith Street), SR 2733 (Jackson Street), Beatty Street / Sloan Street,
Depot Street, NC 115 (Main Street), SR 2693 (Concord Road), South Street, and
Chairman Blake Lane form the basis for the percentage distribution. Distribution
percentages into and out of the study area are calculated using the existing traffic
volumes entering and exiting the study area. This distribution percentage is then
applied to the generated trips to predict routes and project traffic volumes for the
four 2020 parking deck scenarios. Figures 7, 8, and 9 show the distributional
percentages and parking deck trip distribution respectively. 2020 Condition 4 ­ 5
traffic (see Figures 10 ­ 13, respectively) is then determined by applying the site
trip distribution volumes from the potential parking location to the existing and
background traffic volumes found in Condition 2.

C. Traffic Capacity Analysis

Potts-Sloan Connection

For Condition 3, the cycle lengths and green splits of the signalized intersection
are optimized in Synchro. As in Conditions 1 and 2, split timings were adjusted
to allow the overall intersection to operate at LOS D, or better, if possible. If an
intersection operates acceptably with the addition of background traffic growth
and site traffic to the existing cycle lengths, the same cycle lengths and green

Table 7 above reveals that the signalized intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) /
South Street / Chairman Blake Lane is projected to operate at LOS F during both
peak hours of Condition 3 and the intersection of SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan
Street is projected to operate at a LOS F during the Condition 3 PM peak hour.
Additionally, the northbound shared movement at the intersection of SR 2733
(Jackson Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street) is projected to operate at a LOS E
and LOS F during the Condition 3 AM and PM peak hour respectively and the
southbound shared movement at the intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) / SR
2733 (Jackson Street) is projected to operate at a LOS E during the Condition 3
PM peak hour. All other intersection and intersection movements are projected to
operate acceptably during the 2020 Condition 3 With Site AM and PM peak
hours. Each analysis was conducted using the existing geometric configuration
and 2020 Condition 3 - With Site Traffic - Potts / Sloan Connection volumes (see
Figure 7).

Jackson Street Parking Deck

For Condition 4, the cycle lengths and green splits of the signalized intersection
are optimized in Synchro. As in Conditions 1 and 2, split timings were adjusted
to allow the overall intersection to operate at LOS D, or better, if possible. If an
intersection operates acceptably with the addition of background traffic growth
and site traffic to the existing cycle lengths, the same cycle lengths and green
splits were used for Condition 4 for that intersection. A summary of the resulting
LOS and delay values for both the unsignalized (individual movements) and
signalized intersections (overall and individual movements) of the 2020 Condition
4 With Site Traffic - Jackson Street Parking Deck is shown in Table 8 below.
The outputs for each intersection obtained from Synchro Version 7.0 are located
in Appendix E.

the intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson Street) is projected
to operate unacceptably during the 2020 PM peak hour. All other intersection

For Condition 5, the cycle lengths and green splits of the signalized intersection
are optimized in Synchro. As in previous conditions, split timings were adjusted
to allow the overall intersection to operate at LOS D, or better, if possible. If an
intersection operates acceptably with the addition of background traffic growth
and site traffic to the existing cycle lengths, the same cycle lengths and green
splits were used for Condition 5 for that intersection. A summary of the resulting
LOS and delay values for both the unsignalized (individual movements) and
signalized intersections (overall and individual movements) of the 2020 Condition
5 With Site Traffic ­ Depot St Parking Deck volumes is shown in Table 9 below.

D. Intersection Evaluations

SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan Street

The existing signalized intersection at SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan Street
currently operates at LOS B and LOS C during the 2011 AM and PM peak hours
of Condition 1. For 2020 Condition 2 and Condition 3, the addition of background
traffic and traffic rerouted due to the construction of the Potts / Sloan connector
(respectively), Synchro projects that the intersection will operate at LOS C during
2020 AM Peak hour and at LOS F during 2020 PM Peak hour. For Conditions 4,
5 and 6, the construction of a parking deck accessing Jackson Street, Depot
Street, and Griffith Street (respectively), the intersection is projected to operate at
a LOS C during the AM peak hour and LOS F during the PM peak hour.

In order to allow this intersection to operate at an acceptable level of service
during the future 2020 PM peak hour (for Conditions 2 ­ 6), westbound SR 2158
(Griffith Street) will need to be widened to two through lanes. Additionally, the
eastbound left-turn phasing will need to be modified from permitted to protected /
permitted. With these improvements in place, the intersection will operate at a
LOS D during the PM peak hour of each 2020 Condition. Table 11 below shows
the level of service and delay values for the intersection with the addition of the
recommended improvements (with Condition 4, or worst case, traffic scenario).

SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street)

The existing unsignalized intersection at SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / SR 2158
(Griffith Street) has a shared northbound movement that currently operates LOS
E during the 2011 PM peak hour of Condition 1. For 2020 Condition 2 and
Condition 3, the addition of background traffic and Potts / Sloan connector traffic
(respectively), Synchro projects that the intersection's shared northbound
movement will operate at LOS E during 2020 AM Peak hour and at LOS F during
2020 PM Peak hour for both conditions. For Conditions 4, 5 and 6, the
construction of a parking deck accessing Jackson Street, Depot Street, and
Griffith Street (respectively), the northbound intersection movement is projected
to operate at a LOS F during both peak hours. Additionally, the southbound
shared movement is projected to operate unacceptably during the Condition 4
and 6 peak hours.

In order to allow this intersection to operate at an acceptable level of service
during the future 2020 PM peak hour (for Conditions 2 ­ 6) the intersection will
need to be signalized. With this improvement in place, the intersection will
operate at a LOS B or better during both peak hours of each 2020 Condition.
Table 11 below shows the level of service and delay values for the intersection
with the addition of a signal (with Condition 4, or worst case, traffic scenario).

NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street)

The existing signalized intersection at NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith
Street) currently operates at LOS C (or better) during 2011 AM and PM Peak
hours of Condition 1. For 2020 Condition 2 and Condition 3, the addition of
background traffic and Potts / Sloan traffic (respectively), Synchro projects that
the intersection will also operate LOS C during the 2020 AM and PM peak hours
for both conditions. For Conditions 4 and 5, with the construction of parking
decks accessing Jackson Street and Depot Street (respectively), the intersection
is projected to operate at a LOS C during each peak hour. For Condition 6, with
the construction of a parking deck accessing Griffith Street, the intersection is
projected to operate at a LOS D during both peak hours. Because this
intersection is projected to operate acceptably during each future condition, no
future improvements are required at this intersection.

SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / Depot Street

All movements of the existing unsignalized intersection at SR 2733 (Jackson
Street) / Depot Street currently operate at LOS A during the 2011 AM and PM
peak hours of Condition 1. For 2020 Condition 2 and Condition 3, the addition of
background traffic and Potts / Sloan connector traffic (respectively), all
intersection movements are projected to operate at LOS A during 2020 AM and
PM peak hours. For Conditions 4, 5 and 6, the construction of a parking deck
accessing Jackson Street, Depot Street, and Griffith Street (respectively), all
intersection movements are projected to operate at a LOS A during the AM peak
hour or LOS B (or better) during the PM peak hour. Because each intersection
movement is projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during each
future condition, no future improvements are required at this intersection.

NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2693 (Concord Road)

The existing signalized intersection at NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2693 (Concord
Road) currently operates at LOS B during 2011 AM and PM peak hours of
Condition 1. For 2020 Condition 2, with the addition of background traffic,
Synchro projects that the intersection will operate at LOS C during the 2020 AM
and PM peak hours. For Condition 3, with the addition of Potts / Sloan connector
site traffic, Synchro projects that the intersection will operate at LOS B during
2020 AM peak hour and at LOS C during 2020 PM peak hour. For Conditions 4,

5 and 6, the construction of parking decks accessing Jackson Street, Depot
Street, and Griffith Street (respectively), the intersection is projected to operate at
a LOS C during both peak hours.

Though Synchro projects this intersection to operate at acceptable levels of
service, significant southbound queuing has been observed at this intersection
(particularly during the PM peak hour), often extending northward to the
intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) / Depot Street. 2020 Condition 4 PM peak
hour analyses project 95% queue lengths of approximately 285-feet. To help
ease this queuing and help with future signal coordination along NC 115 (Main
Street), it is recommended that this intersection be restriped to include a 50-foot
southbound left-turn lane. The addition of this left-turn lane will reduce the
overall (Condition 4) intersection level of service to LOS B and will reduce the
overall delay from 25.5 seconds per vehicle to 19.5 seconds per vehicle.
Preliminary designs were completed at this location and it was determined that
approximately five parking spaces will need to be removed (along the eastern
side of Main Street) to accommodate the restriping. No geometric improvements
will be required to complete the restriping.

NC 115 (Main Street) / South Street / Chairman Blake Lane

According to Synchro calculations, the existing signalized intersection at NC 115
(Main Street) / South Street / Chairman Blake Lane currently operates at LOS F
during 2011 AM and PM peak hours of Condition 1. For 2020 Condition 2 and
Condition 3, the addition of background traffic and Potts / Sloan connector traffic
(respectively), Synchro projects that the intersection will operate at LOS F during
2020 AM and PM peak hours for both conditions. For Conditions 4, 5 and 6, the
construction of parking decks accessing Jackson Street, Depot Street, and
Griffith Street (respectively), the intersection is projected to continue to operate at
a failing level of service during each peak hour.

SimTraffic runs were created for this intersection to provide a more accurate
representation of future levels of service and delay values. Using Condition 4
PM peak hour traffic to represent a worst-case traffic scenario, simulated 10
times, the overall intersection operated at a LOS C (16.5 sec/veh). Because of
this (and due to limited space within the downtown region, no improvement
recommendation are provided or recommended for this intersection.

NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson Street)

All of the movements of the unsignalized intersection NC 115 (Main Street) / SR
2733 (Jackson Street) currently operate at LOS C or better during 2011 AM and
PM peak hours for Condition 1. For 2020 Condition 2, the addition of background
traffic, Synchro projects that the intersection's shared southbound movement will
operate at LOS F during 2020 PM peak hour. For Condition 3, the addition of
Potts / Sloan connector traffic, Synchro projects that the intersection's shared

southbound movement will operate at LOS E for PM peak hour. For Conditions
4, 5 and 6, the construction of parking decks accessing Jackson Street, Depot
Street, and Griffith Street (respectively), the southbound intersection movement
is projected to operate at a LOS F during both peak hours.

In order to allow this intersection to operate at an acceptable level of service
during the future 2020 PM peak hour (for Conditions 2 ­ 6) the intersection will
need to be signalized. With this improvement in place, the intersection will
operate at a LOS B or better during both peak hours of each 2020 Condition.
Table 11 below shows the level of service and delay values for the intersection
with the addition of a signal (with Condition 4, or worst case, traffic scenario).


V. Conclusions and Recommendations

In conclusion, SEPI analyzed the existing and five future conditions for the
Davidson Parking Study:

     Condition 2: 2020 Without Site Traffic
     Condition 3: 2020 With Site Traffic Potts-Sloan Connection
     Condition 4: 2020 With Site Traffic Jackson Street 300 Space Parking Deck
     Condition 5: 2020 With Site Traffic Depot Street 300 Space Parking Deck
     Condition 6: 2020 With Site Traffic Griffith Street 300 Space Parking Deck

Based on the analyses conducted, four intersections will require
improvements due to future 2020 traffic projections. Improvements are required
at the intersections of SR 2158 (Griffith Street) / Sloan Street, SR 2733 (Jackson
Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith Street), NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2693 (Concord
Road) and NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson Street) to allow each
intersection to operate acceptably during the 2020 future year. Using Condition 4
traffic volumes as a "worst-case" traffic scenario, the intersection of SR 2158
(Griffith Street) / Sloan Street will require the addition of second westbound
through lane as well as modification to the intersection phasing. Signalization will
be required at the intersections of SR 2733 (Jackson Street) / SR 2158 (Griffith
Street) and NC 115 (Main Street) / SR 2733 (Jackson Street) in order for both to
operate acceptably during both 2020 peak hours. To help with intersection
queuing, it is recommended that the intersection of NC 115 (Main Street) / SR
2693 (Concord Road) be restriped to include a southbound left-turn lane. Table
11 below shows the improved intersection levels of service and delay values. All
other intersections (signalized) and intersection movements (unsignalized) are
projected to operate acceptable during both 2020 peak hours.

Finally, it is recommended that the signal timings along NC 115 (Main Street) be
coordinated to help facilitate traffic flow along the corridor. To accomplish this
coordination, the traffic signal cabinet at the intersection of SR 2158 (Griffith
Street) / NC 115 (Main Street) will need to be updated to be consistent with the

corridor will improve network levels of service and provide for smoother flow
through Downtown Davidson.

1. Block 2 express commuter ridership is increased by 3% per year, 41 riders as of April 2010 (5 year increase to 51riders = 9 additional spaces and 10 year changes to train ridership)
2. a)Block 3 potential new development in the 5 year scenario, 30,000 sf retail, 50,000 sf office, 75 residential (278 spaces).                                                                                                        574,397
    b) in the 10 year senario, commuter rail station developed in block 3 with 188 riders (157 spaces), express bus ridership is now taken out of block 2.
3. Block 7 has 10 vacant residential units, these units are filled at 40% (5 year) and 80% (10 year) occupancy in future demand
4.a) Block 12/13 Mooney's Corner development included in current demand: 15,000 sf mixed use (36 spaces).
   b) 5 year senario Town hall moves to block 10 in IB School building (33,400 sf) only using 7,000 sf (18 spaces), assume old Town Hall is reoccupied by use with similar parking generation ratios and fire hall stays
   c) 10 year senario potential 10,000 sf retail (20 spaces) and 30,000 sf office (86 spaces) in front of Town Hall on parking lot, reduse parking supply by 26 spaces.

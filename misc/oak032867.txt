                                                                                   1. Introduction

Purpose of Document
In 1999 and 2000, the City of Oakland developed plans for widening and realignment of local streets,
connector roads, and ramps in the vicinity of the I-880/High Street interchange, in conjunction with
Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project. The City's plans for this area are known as the
42nd Avenue/High Street Access Improvements Project ("the Project"). In March of 2001, the City
published a Combined Notice of Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) and Mitigated Negative
Declaration for the Project, and in October of 2001 the Oakland City Council made findings and approved
the Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (the 2001 Neg. Dec.) and subsequently approved the
Project.
Implementation of the City's 42nd Avenue/High Street Access Improvements Project will only
commence once Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project (which is currently under
construction) is complete, funding for the City Project is secured, and necessary right-of-way has been
acquired. Caltrans now estimates that construction of their High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project
will be complete in 2014. In order to acquire necessary right-of-way, the City anticipates the need to
acquire portions of certain private parcels, potentially by eminent domain. If the City proceeds by eminent
domain, the City Council must first exercise its discretion to adopt a Resolution of Necessity. As the
decision whether to adopt a Resolution of Necessity is a discretionary action, it is considered a "project"
under CEQA.
The purpose of this document is to determine, pursuant to Public Resources Code Sections 21090 and
21166 and California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Sections 15180, 15162 and 15163,
whether a Subsequent or Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or Negative Declaration
(Neg. Dec.) is needed to fully assess and evaluate the potential environmental effects of the 42nd
Avenue/High Street Access Improvements Project, or whether the City can rely on the previously
prepared 2001 Neg. Dec. prepared for that project for its current pending actions.
CEQA provides that when an EIR has been certified or a Negative Declaration has been adopted, no
Subsequent or Supplemental environmental review shall be prepared unless the Lead Agency determines,
on the basis of substantial evidence, one or more of the following:
    ·   substantial changes are proposed as part of the Project that would involve major revisions to the
        previous 2001 Negative Declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental
        effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects,
    ·   substantial changes have occurred with respect to circumstances under which the Project is
        undertaken (i.e., a significant change in the existing or future condition) that would involve new
        significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified
        significant effects, and/or
    ·   information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known
        with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the 2001 MND was adopted, shows that; a)
        new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of significant
        environmental effects already identified in the 2001 MND; or b) mitigation measures which were
        previously determined not to be feasible would in fact be feasible, or mitigation measures which
        are considerably different from those adopted pursuant to the 2001 MND would substantially
        reduce significant effects of the project, but the City declines to adopt them.


ADDENDUM TO THE 42ND AVENUE/HIGH STREET ACCESS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT NEGATIVE DECLARATION             PAGE 1-1
1 ­ INTRODUCTION

If none of these factors are applicable, then no subsequent or supplemental Negative Declaration would
be required. If some changes or additions to the original environmental document are necessary, but none
of the changes would warrant preparation of a subsequent or supplemental Negative Declaration, the City
may prepare and Addendum to the previous CEQA document, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section
15164.

Changes in Circumstances
There have been changes in circumstances since certification of the 2001 Neg. Dec., including:
    ·      Caltrans is currently constructing the High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project, which was
           approved in December of 1999. The High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project is scheduled
           to be complete in the summer of 2014.
    ·      Traffic volumes in and around the Project area have changed over time as a result of cumulative
           growth and development, as well as the re-routing of traffic flow as a result of construction of
           Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project.
    ·      The City of Oakland has completed several of the fee and easement acquisitions within the
           Project area necessary to implement the Project.
    ·      Additional hazardous materials characterization and clean-up operations have been conducted on
           several properties within the Project area. These changes are more fully documented in the
           Hazards and hazardous Materials section of this document.
The degree to which these changed circumstances may have new or previously unanticipated
environmental consequences affecting the proposed Project are more fully evaluated in subsequent
sections of this document.

Changes in the Project
This document assesses the extent to which changes to the Project may result in new or significantly
increased effects. Further environmental review of the Project is only required if necessary to address
substantial changes to the previous 2001 Neg. Dec. necessary to adequately address new or different
information specific to the current Project. The current Project is the same project as analyzed in the
2001 Neg. Dec., and no changes are proposed.
The current discretionary action before the City is consideration of adoption of one or more Resolutions
of Necessity, a formal decision to acquire property by eminent domain. Such a resolution must be adopted
before the City can commence an eminent domain action in court. Acquisition of those properties that are
the subject of a potential Resolution of Necessity was fully contemplated in the 2001 Neg. Dec., and a
decision by the City to pursue acquisition of right-of-way for these improvements at 42nd and High Street
is not a change in the Project.

New Information
This document also assesses the extent to which new information, not known at the time of preparation of
the 2001 Neg. Dec., may indicate a new or significantly increased environmental effect. Although not
legally required, in order to provide more information to the public and decision makers, and in the
interest of being conservative, new information specifically includes new guidance and environmental
review requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change which were not
addressed in the previous Neg. Dec., as well as new thresholds for air quality impacts as recommended by
the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) and now utilized by the City of Oakland.

                                                                                          1 - INTRODUCTION

Since information on air quality and climate change was known, or could have been known in 2001, it is
not legally "new information" as specifically defined under CEQA. However, an analysis of the proposed
Project relying on the new Air District guidance and thresholds has been conducted.
Additionally, since 2001 the City has adopted Uniformly Applied Development Standards and Standard
Conditions of Approval. These development standards are incorporated into all projects as Standard
Conditions of Approval (SCAs), regardless of a project's environmental determination, pursuant in part to
CEQA Guidelines Section 15183. As applicable, the SCAs are adopted as requirements of an individual
project when approved by the City. These standards are designed to, and will substantially mitigate
environmental effects. All applicable SCAs will be adopted as requirements of the Project. All applicable
City of Oakland Standard Conditions of Approval are included in the Standard Conditions of Approval
and Mitigation Monitoring Program (SCAMMP) for the Project, attached as Appendix A.


General Project Information
The purpose of this evaluation is to determine whether a Subsequent or Supplemental Environmental
Impact Report (EIR) or Mitigated Negative Declaration is needed to fully assess and evaluate the impacts
of the proposed 42nd Avenue/High Street Access Improvements Project. Previous environmental review
was conducted for the Project pursuant to an Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration and
Environmental Assessment for the Combined Project Study Report/Project Report approved by the City
of Oakland in October of 2001 (the 2001 Neg. Dec.). The 2001 Neg. Dec. was a combined project-
specific, focused environmental document prepared for the 42nd Avenue/High Street Access
Improvements Project, required under the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) of 1970. The intent of that combined NEPA/CEQA
document was to address potential environmental issues associated with the construction and operation of
the proposed Project.
As detailed below, an Addendum to that 2001 Neg. Dec. is the appropriate CEQA document and no
Supplemental or Subsequent EIR or Mitigated Negative Declaration is required. This document
constitutes the Addendum.

ADDENDUM TO THE 42ND AVENUE/HIGH STREET ACCESS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT NEGATIVE DECLARATION           PAGE 1-3
1 ­ INTRODUCTION

Project Location:
The proposed 42nd Avenue/High Street Improvement Project is located within the City of Oakland, along
the 1-880 corridor in Alameda County (see Figure 1-1). The Project Area is limited to the surface streets
of 42nd Avenue, High Street, East 8th Street, Alameda Avenue, Oakport Street and Coliseum Way, all
located within the City of Oakland.

Project Sponsor's Name and Address:
City of Oakland Public Works Agency, Transportation Services Division
250 Frank H. Ogawa Plaza, Suite 4344
Oakland, CA 94612

General Plan Designation
Within the Project area, lands on the north side of High Street are designated under the Estuary Plan as
General Commercial, and lands on the south side of High Street are designated under the Estuary Plan as
Light Industry 3.

Zoning
All lands west of I-880 in the Project area are Zoned M-40: Heavy Industry

Existing Land Uses
The Project area is developed with transportation facilities (I-880 and adjoining arterial roads),
commercial and light industrial uses, and one residence. The eastern portion of the Project area, east of I-
880 is developed and used for a combination of construction-related retail and general industry uses. The
western side of the Project area, west of 1-880 is a combination of light industrial and commercial
development. One single-family residence is located at the intersection of Jensen and High streets.

Description of the Project
The proposed 42nd Avenue/High Street Improvement Project includes widening and realignment of local
streets, connector roads and ramps in the vicinity of the I-880/High Street interchange, in conjunction
with Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project (see following Project Description).
The right-of-way needed for these improvements requires acquisition of portions of properties and/or
easements from up to 16 separate parcels. Several of these properties and/or easements have already been
acquired, but the City has, as yet, been unable to obtain all of the right-of-way needed for the Project. To
acquire all other remaining portions of those parcels not yet acquired, the City anticipates commencing
eminent domain actions to condemn this land. A Resolution of Necessity is the City's formal decision to
acquire property by eminent domain, and it must be adopted before the City can commence an eminent
domain action in court. Adoption of a Resolution of Necessity is a discretionary action, and thus subject
to CEQA.

Other Public Agency Approvals Required
    ·      Caltrans
    ·      Alameda County Transportation Commission

Requested Actions and Required Approvals
This Addendum is intended to, and does provide CEQA clearance for any and all discretionary actions
and approvals for the Project, including without limitation:
    ·   Decisions to acquire additional real property interests, including without limitation by the
        adoption of one or more Resolutions of Necessity and commencement of eminent domain
        proceedings and/or other actions necessary for acquisition of property
    ·   Award of construction contracts
    ·   Grading, encroachment, "P' job and any/all construction-related permits and approvals


Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15063, this document provides an evaluation of whether the
Project will have any new significant effects on the environment.
    ·   If an environmental issue would not be affected by the Project or its impact would be less than
        significant, it is identified in the following evaluation as "No Impact" or "Less than
        Significant".
    ·   If the Project may cause a significant effect on the environment, this evaluation also determines
        whether this effect was adequately examined in the previous 2001 Neg. Dec. If the
        environmental issue was adequately examined in the previous document, it is identified in the
        following evaluation as "No New Impact". To the extent that mitigation measures were adopted
        pursuant to the 2001 Neg. Dec., and these measures continue to be applicable to the Project, these
        measures are specifically identified. In some cases, the City has since adopted Standard
        Conditions of Approval (SCAs) that would update or add to the adopted mitigation measures, and
        these SCAs are identified as well.
    ·   If there is a new significant environmental effect or a substantial increase in the severity of a
        previously identified significant effect, it would be identified in the following evaluation as
        potentially significant. To the extent that mitigation measures recommended in this document are
        capable of reducing the significance of such impacts to less than significant, it is identified in the
        following evaluation as "Less than Significant with Mitigation".

Background

Caltrans' I-880 Corridor Improvement Project
Following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which resulted in collapse of the Cypress Street Viaduct,
Caltrans embarked upon a major reconstruction of the collapsed portion of I-880 with a more seismically
sound structure along a new alignment around the outskirts of West Oakland. Due to age and heavy use,
Caltrans determined that a number of additional seismic and safety improvements along the I-880 corridor
were required, and embarked upon a major I-880 Corridor Improvement Project. The I-880 Corridor
Improvement Project includes a number of re-designed and expanded interchanges to improve traffic
flow, rehabilitation and repaving of the freeway surfaces, and replacement of existing bridges with more
seismically secure structures. The individual improvements included under the I-880 Corridor
Improvement Project include widening of I-880/I-238, reconstruction of the SR-92/I-880 interchange, I-
880 surface rehabilitation and repaving, seismic retrofit of the 5th Avenue interchange, replacement of the
23rd Avenue Bridge, replacement of the 29th Avenue bridge, rehabilitation of the Fruitvale Avenue
overhead interchange, and seismic retrofit of the High Street bride. Each of these individual projects is in
various stages of design, construction or completion.
Currently, seismic reconstruction at the 5th Avenue and High Street bridges on I-880 in Oakland
represent some of the last seismic retrofit projects on major transportation corridors to occur in California.

Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project
As one of California's last major seismic retrofit projects, Caltrans is currently replacing the old High
Street Bridge structure with a new structure designed in accordance with modern seismic safety standards.
The Combined Project Study Report/Project Report for the Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic
Retrofit Project was approved in December of 1999. That project was developed through a partnership
with the City of Oakland, the City of Alameda, and the Alameda County Transportation Commission.
Construction began in fall 2009, at an estimated cost of $100 million.
The Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project (see Figure 2-1) consists of replacing two
bridges along 1-880 which span an abandoned Union Pacific Railroad rail track, High Street and SR77
(42nd Avenue). The old ramps and connectors are being replaced with at-grade intersections, with the
exception of the northbound on-ramp structure, which was previously retro-fitted and will remain in
place. At 42nd Avenue, the Caltrans High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project is removing the ramp
connectors to I-880 and replacing them with at-grade intersections. Once complete, 42nd Avenue will
terminate at the I-880 southbound off-ramp. The Caltrans High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project
is also re-aligning a portion of East 8th Street south of 37th Avenue, and is re-aligning Oakport Street
further west in order to rebuild the I-880 southbound structure. The Caltrans High Street Overhead
Seismic Retrofit Project does not include reconstruction or realignment of Coliseum Way.
In mid-November of 2011, Caltrans opened the new southbound I-880 bridge over High Street, and
southbound traffic shifted onto the new bridge. After the traffic shift, northbound I-880 traffic shifted
onto the older southbound bridge at High Street. This allowed for demolition of the existing northbound I-
880 bridge and construction the new northbound bridge.

The Caltrans High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project is scheduled to be complete in the summer of
2014. Once complete, the new High Street Bridge will be smoother and stronger, will provide motorists
with better visibility and larger shoulders, and will reconfigure the exit ramps to reduce back-ups entering
and exiting the freeway at the SR-77/42nd Avenue interchange.

City of Oakland's 42nd Avenue/High Street Access Improvements Project
The Caltrans High Street Overhead Structure Seismic Retrofit Project is being developed to mitigate
structural deficiencies on 1-880 only. It is not intended to address access or capacity improvements or
improvements to local circulation, even though the extension of 42nd Avenue, the reconfiguration of the
at-grade SR 77 interchange, and the connector ramps for the new High Street Bridge will tie directly into
existing local roadways. Therefore, in order to provide conjunctive improvements needed to link and
optimize traffic circulation between the local roadway network and the reconfigured interchange and
associated intersections, the City of Oakland developed plans for local roadways intended to be mutually
supportive to the Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project.
In 1999 and 2000, the City of Oakland held meetings with the City of Alameda and Caltrans to discuss
issues and coordinate the City of Oakland's plans for widening and realignment of local streets, connector
roads, and ramps in the vicinity of the interchange with Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit
Project. The purpose of the City's plans for this area, known as the 42nd Avenue/High Street Access
Improvements Project, is to: the proposed improvements
    ·   Improve circulation of local roadways at the 1-880 and 42nd Avenue interchange. Improved
        circulation would relieve local traffic congestion and encourage development for the cities of
        Oakland and Alameda, and the Port of Oakland.
    ·   Improve access for vehicles traveling to and from the cities of Oakland and Alameda via 42nd
        Avenue and High Street from 1-880. The proposed improvements are needed to facilitate
        movement of local traffic on and off of 1-880, and to destinations both east and west of the
        existing 1-880 freeway.
    ·   Improve operational capacity for the intersections at the freeway on-ramps and off-ramps. Three
        signalized intersections, all of which are on High Street, currently serve the Project area.
        Although, the level of service during AM and PM peak periods in 2001 ranged between LOS A
        and LOS D, the estimated maximum queues during the AM and PM peak periods present
        significant problems at the two intersections serving freeway ramps.
    ·   Major queuing also occurs at both northbound and southbound off-ramps in both peak periods.
        The queue extends upstream and blocks other traffic movements, resulting in constricted traffic
        flows during peak periods.
    ·   Identify acceptable column locations for the Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit
        Project which would not preclude or interfere with the City's plans.
The proposed Project will serve to implement Policy SAF-IO of the City of Oakland Estuary Plan, which
states "Work with Caltrans, BART, and other Transportation Agencies to upgrade connecting routes
between inland neighborhoods, 1-880, and local streets, to enhance East Oakland access to the
waterfront." The proposed Project also implements Policy SAF-IO.2 of the Estuary Plan, which states,
"If feasible, construct an urban diamond interchange at 42nd Avenue with frontage road connections to
Fruitvale Avenue."

2 ­ PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The specific improvements contemplated under the City's 42nd Avenue/High Street Access Improvements
Project are described below, and are shown on Figure 2-2.

High Street Improvements
High Street runs perpendicular to I-880 and parallel to 42nd Avenue in the vicinity of the proposed
Project. High Street will be widened from four to six lanes to provide improved capacity at intersections
with frontage roads and freeway connections. The widening of High Street at the intersections of the
northbound off-ramp and southbound on-ramps to I-880 will increase the operational capacity of the
intersections and circulation will improve.
The widening of High Street under I-880 to accommodate the additional lanes required placement of a
pier for the Caltrans High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project in the median of High Street. The
construction staging of High Street requires building the outside lanes first, while traffic uses the existing
High Street. Traffic will then shift to the newly completed outer portions of High Street while building
the inside lanes and median. The proposed grade will match the existing grade to allow easy detour of
traffic to newly completed portions of High Street. The new ramps for northbound and southbound 1-880
will align with the existing ramp intersections, so that no substantial portion of the interchange ramps will
have to be re-built. Landscaping will be provided within the median areas on High Street, and at the edge
of sidewalks where new sidewalks will be provided.

42nd Avenue Extension
The Project will extend 42nd Avenue as a new roadway, parallel to High Street and connecting to a re-
alignment of Alameda Avenue. The extension of 42nd Avenue to Alameda Avenue will result in a parallel
roadway to High Street, and will provide a direct route for traffic from the southbound I-880 off-ramp
traveling to Alameda, as well as for Alameda traffic heading to the freeway in both the northbound and
southbound direction. This addition will improve local circulation. Landscaping will be provided at the
edge of sidewalks where new sidewalks will be constructed.

Realignment of Other Connecting Street
West of I-880, the parallel streets of Howard Street and Jensen Street will be realigned to eliminate an
off-set intersection. Re-alignments are also proposed for Oakport Street and Coliseum Way.

Right-of-Way Acquisition and Other Effects
Right-of-way acquisition will be (or has been) required from an estimated 16 parcels, none of which are
anticipated to be full parcel takes. Nine businesses located on High Street, Oakport Street and Alameda
Avenue may be affected by the Project. The Project will require demolition of buildings on High Street
and reconstruction of entrances, parking and landscaping along the remaining business frontages. All
other parcels affected by the Project are un-improved land or are impacted such that the partial take has
little effect on the remainder.

Project's PSR and Environmental Review History
A brief history of documentation for the 42nd Avenue/High Street Access Improvement Project includes
the following key milestones:
    ·      In 1999 the City was awarded $1 million from the 2000 State Transportation Improvement
           Program (STIP) for engineering design work.
    ·      In December of 2000, the City issued a Combined Project Study Report/Project Report describing
           the proposed 42nd Avenue/High Street Access Improvements Project.
    ·      Neighborhood meetings were held in both Oakland and Alameda to inform and obtain input from
           the community.
    ·      In March of 2001, the City published a Combined Notice of Finding of No Significant Impact
           (FONSI) and Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project.
    ·      In July of 2001, Caltrans gave the City the authorization to proceed with the plans and
           specifications for the Project.
    ·      In October of 2001, the Oakland City Council made findings and determined, prior to taking
           action on the Project, that: i) the Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration was prepared by
           the City of Oakland as the lead agency and properly circulated for public review and comments;
           ii) the proposed IS/NIND was independently reviewed and analyzed by the Oakland City Council
           and reflects the independent judgment of the Council; iii) the IS/MND is legally adequate and
           was completed in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) ; iv) the
           IS/MND identifies all potential significant impacts and feasible mitigation measures that would
           reduce these impacts to less than significant levels; and v) the Mitigation Monitoring Program is
           adopted and incorporated into the Project
    ·      Following their CEQA findings, the City Council adopted a resolution authorizing the City
           Manager to make application, accept and appropriate Regional Improvement Program Funds to
           be programmed by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) in the 2002 Regional
           Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP) for improvements to 42nd Avenue/High Street
           Access Improvement Project. The City requested programming of $3,130,000 for right of way
           acquisition.


Current "Project"
In order for the City to continue its efforts toward implementation of the 42nd and High Street I-880
Access Improvement Project, staff has determined that the City of Oakland's acquisition of certain
property rights (fee, permanent easement and temporary construction easement) is necessary for the
widening and extension of the right-of-way for the Project. Staff plans to propose that the City Council
authorize acquisition by eminent domain of these property rights from parcels owned by Equilon
Enterprises, Laurence C. & Diane M. Webster, and the defunct Leona Chemical Company.
The City Council previously approved the negotiated acquisition of all property interests necessary for the
Project. The City has currently accepted contracts, or has closed escrow on twenty-one of the twenty-
seven property interests that are required for the Project. The property rights now at issue are among the
property interest identified for negotiated acquisition, but which the City has not successfully negotiated
acquisition. The property rights on these properties have been appraised and offers to acquire the property
rights at the appraised fair market values have been made to all of the property owners, except for the

The City's acquisition of these last remaining property interests is necessary to construct the Project,
specifically for the new alignment and reconfiguration of High Street, Alameda Avenue and Jensen
Street.
A formal decision by the City to acquire property through eminent domain, known as a Resolution of
Necessity, must be adopted before the City (as condemning agency) can commence an eminent domain
action in court.
California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1245.230 provides that in order to adopt a resolution of
necessity, the government agency must find:
a) that the project for which the property is to be acquired is necessary;
b) that the property is necessary for the public project;
c) that the project is located in such a manner as to offer the greatest public benefit with the least private
   detriment; and
d) that an offer to purchase the property has been made pursuant to Government Code section 7267.2, or
   that no offer was made because the owner could not be found.
Funding for right-of-way acquisition is being provided by a State Transportation Improvement Program
(STIP) grant, which was programmed in 2007.

Summary of the 2001 Negative Declaration

2001 Setting

Circulation System
The 2001 Neg. Dec described the existing circulation system within the Project area as including the
following major roadways:
     ·    I-880
     ·    42nd Avenue (SR77)
     ·    High Street
     ·    East 8th Street
     ·    Alameda Avenue
     ·    Oakport Street
     ·    Coliseum Way
     ·    Howard Street

Intersection Level of Service
In 2001, the Project area was served by three signalized intersections located at Oakport Street/High
Street; Howard Street/High Street; and Coliseum Way/High Street. Operations at these intersections were
studied to establish baseline traffic conditions in the Project area. As shown in Table 3-1 below, the
existing levels of service range from LOS A to LOS D, with a maximum delay of 51.6 seconds.

3 ­ TRAFFIC AND CIRCULATION

Intersection Queues
In 2001, traffic queues occurring during the AM and PM peak periods presented significant problems at
the two intersections serving freeway on-ramps. Of particular concern was the northbound left turn
movement at the intersection of High Street/Coliseum Way, where queues extended upstream past the
Alameda Avenue intersection, causing restricted traffic flows during peak periods. Major queuing also
occurred on both off-ramps during both peak periods. Traffic backed up onto the freeway at the
northbound and southbound off-ramps during the 2001 AM and PM peak periods. Additionally, single
left-turn lanes under the High Street overhead bridge had deficient storage in both directions, causing
backups to the northbound and southbound 1-880 traffic on High Street.

2001 Neg. Dec Environmental Conclusions (Impacts and Mitigation Measures)
This section summarizes the traffic operations that the 2001 Neg. Dec. expected to result from
implementation of the Project. The analysis of traffic operations was based on projected future traffic
volumes, the ability of the Project to accommodate this volume, and comparisons between the No Project
and Project scenarios.

Travel Demand Forecasts
The 2001 Neg. Dec. estimated that the Project would result in an increase of 12% of eastbound traffic on
High Street in the AM peak, and 17% in the PM peak. An increase in traffic was also expected for
westbound traffic on High Street, west of Howard Street during both peak hours. The Project's improved
connections to Alameda Avenue and High Street were expected to result in traffic increases in both the
eastbound and westbound directions on 42nd Avenue as compared to the No Project scenario.

Traffic Analysis Results
Future traffic operations were analyzed for the No Project and Project scenario by calculating levels of
service for six signalized intersections in the Project area.

Intersection Analysis
The intersections that would be created as part of the Project, or substantially impacted by the Project,
were analyzed for the year 2025. As shown in Table 3-2, the analysis indicated that by 2025 without the
Project (i.e., the No Project scenario), traffic increases were projected to result in the following
conditions:
    ·      The level of service at the intersection of Coliseum Way/High Street would worsen to LOS F by
           2025, and eventually cause an extension of the AM and PM peak periods at that intersection.
    ·      Traffic queues would significantly increase as compared to 2001 conditions. The largest increases
           in queue length would occur on the northbound approach to High Street from the off-ramp, and at
           the eastbound left and westbound through movements. The increase for the eastbound left turn
           movement was particularly troublesome, as the queue for this movement already significantly
           exceeded the available storage length.
    ·      The No Project scenario was found to not provide adequate capacity for forecasts of critical
           movements.

Circulation System
Currently a portion of the Project site is under construction for the Caltrans' High Street Overhead
Seismic Retrofit Project. The street configuration shown in Figure 3-1 represents current conditions
during construction of the Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project. The local streets and
freeway ramps affected by the High Street Seismic Retrofit Project are shown in Figure 3-2. The street
configuration shown in Figure 3-2 shows the street layout prior to construction of the Caltrans' High
Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project

I-880
I-880 is an existing, eight-lane, divided freeway with southbound on-ramps and northbound off-ramps
connecting at-grade with High street. Within Alameda County, 1-880 varies from a six-to eight-lane
urban freeway, extending from downtown Oakland to the Alameda/Santa Clara County line in the City of
Milpitas. The facility is one of the principal means of access for northern and southern areas of Alameda
County and the Bay Area, and is a vital highway for the transport of goods and people in the region.

42nd Avenue (SR77)
42nd Avenue (SR77) is an existing four lane divided expressway with curb and gutter and raised median.
42nd Avenue begins just east of Foothill Boulevard and runs west to terminate with ramp connectors at 1-
880. 42nd Avenue passes below the Union Pacific railroad approximately 130 feet east of I-880. This

section of 42nd Avenue is in a deep cut with no pedestrian access and no on-street parking. The posted
speed limit is 45 mph.

High Street
High Street is a major east-west four-lane arterial connecting the cities of Oakland and Alameda. Between
Oakport Street and Coliseum Way, High Street is widened to six lanes, which includes side-by-side left-
turn lanes. Pedestrian access is provided along the south side of High Street through the construction area
and sidewalks are provides along both sides of the street east and west of the Project area. On-street
parking is prohibited along High Street in the Project vicinity. The posted speed limit is 35 mph.

East 8th Street
East 8th Street is a two-lane, two-way frontage road extending north from Alameda Avenue to a Home
Depot south entrance, where access further to the north is restricted by a barricade. At Alameda Avenue,
southbound movements on 8th Street are restricted to right-turn only.

Alameda Avenue
Alameda Avenue is a two-lane roadway with curb and gutter and sidewalk on the north side along the
Home Depot parking lot. A separate left-turn lane serves westbound turning movements from Alameda
Avenue to Howard Street. Between Oakport Street and East 8th Street, Alameda Avenue is one-way
westbound.

Oakport Street
Oakport Street is a two-lane frontage road that runs parallel to the west side 1-880, starting at High Street
and extending south to Hegenberger Road. In the vicinity of High Street, Oakport Street carries traffic
from High Street to the southbound I-880 on-ramp.

Intersection Levels of Service ­ Existing (2011)

Level of Service Methodology
The level of service (LOS) at study intersections was analyzed for the a.m. peak and p.m. peak hours
using methodologies described in the Highway Capacity Manual. The intersection operations analysis
was conducted using the Synchro analysis tool, as required by the City. The signal timing sheets were
provided by the City of Oakland staff. Turning movement data is provided in Appendix B.
The LOS for signalized and unsignalized intersections is defined in terms of delay, which is a measure of
driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time. Delay is a complex measure and is dependent upon a
number of variables, including the number of vehicles in the traffic stream. For signalized intersections,
delay is also dependent on the quality of signal progression, the signal cycle length, and the "green" ratio
for each approach or lane group. For intersections with one or two stop signs, delay is dependent on the
number of gaps available in the uncontrolled traffic stream. Table 3-4 and Table 3-5 define LOS and
criteria for the signalized and unsignalized intersection analyses.

Existing Regulatory Setting
Since 2001 the City has adopted Uniformly Applied Development Standards and Standard Conditions of
Approval that apply to all development projects, and thus will also apply to this Project.
        SCA Traf-1: Construction Traffic and Parking (Prior to the issuance of a demolition, grading or
        building permit). The project applicant and construction contractor shall meet with appropriate City
        of Oakland agencies to determine traffic management strategies to reduce, to the maximum extent
        feasible, traffic congestion and the effects of parking demand by construction workers during
        construction of this project and other nearby projects that could be simultaneously under
        construction. The project applicant shall develop a construction management plan for review and
        approval by the Planning and Zoning Division, the Building Services Division, and the
        Transportation Services Division. The plan shall include at least the following items and
        requirements:
            a)   A set of comprehensive traffic control measures, including scheduling of major truck trips
                 and deliveries to avoid peak traffic hours, detour signs if required, lane closure procedures,
                 signs, cones for drivers, and designated construction access routes.
            b) Notification procedures for adjacent property owners and public safety personnel regarding
               when major deliveries, detours, and lane closures will occur.
            c)   Location of construction staging areas for materials, equipment, and vehicles at an approved
                 location.
            d) A process for responding to, and tracking, complaints pertaining to construction activity,
               including identification of an onsite complaint manager. The manager shall determine the
               cause of the complaints and shall take prompt action to correct the problem. Planning and
               Zoning shall be informed who the Manager is prior to the issuance of the first permit issued
               by Building Services.
            e)   Provision for accommodation of pedestrian flow.
            f)   Provision for parking management and spaces for all construction workers to ensure that
                 construction workers do not park in on street spaces.
            g)   Any damage to the street caused by heavy equipment, or as a result of this construction,
                 shall be repaired, at the applicant's expense, within one week of the occurrence of the
                 damage (or excessive wear), unless further damage/excessive wear may continue; in such
                 case, repair shall occur prior to issuance of a final inspection of the building permit. All
                 damage that is a threat to public health or safety shall be repaired immediately. The street
                 shall be restored to its condition prior to the new construction as established by the City
                 Building Inspector and/or photo documentation, at the applicant's expense, before the
                 issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.
            h) Any heavy equipment brought to the construction site shall be transported by truck, where

These Standard Conditions of Approval are mandatory City requirements and will be imposed and
implemented by the Project. With implementation, these Standard Conditions of Approval will reduce
potential construction-period traffic impacts to less-than-significant levels.


Potential Effects

Proposed Project
The proposed Project expands the traffic capacity for local roadways at the I-880/SR-77 (42nd
Avenue)/High Street interchange and provides a direct connection between 42nd Avenue and Alameda
Avenue with two eastbound lanes, one westbound through lane and one westbound left turn lane. Bike
lanes would be provided along both sides of the new connection and along Alameda Avenue through the
Project area. The Project includes re-alignments for Howard Street, Oakport Street, Coliseum Way and
Jensen Street. High Street would be widened at the intersections with the frontage roads and freeway
connections. New sidewalks would be provided along both sides of High Street through the Project area.
This section evaluates transportation related impacts of the proposed Project. Study intersections were
evaluated for cumulative year 2035 conditions. Intersections were not analyzed for the year 2020
conditions as there are no planned transportation improvements between years 2020 and 2035 that are
expected to affect the study findings. In addition, traffic volumes in 2035 are likely to be higher than in
2020. Given both of those conditions, 2035 likely represents a worst case scenario for the assessment of
transportation impacts. If there is no impact in 2035, it is not likely that an impact would occur in 2020.
Also, if there is an impact in 2035, it is not likely to be worse in 2020.

Significance Thresholds
The significance criteria are based on the current version from City of Oakland dated August 24, 2011.
Only the thresholds that would apply to this type of project are listed below, along with the threshold
number from the City's CEQA Thresholds of Significance Guidelines.
The project would not:
    ·    Affect traffic operations on signalized intersections within the Downtown area
    ·    Significantly affect unsignalized intersections
    ·    Generate vehicle trips on the CMP or MTS
    ·    Reduce the vehicle capacity of a roadway segment of the CMP Network
    ·    Generate substantial multi-modal traffic traveling across at-grade railroad crossings
    ·    Fundamentally conflict with adopted City policies
    ·    Result in a change in air traffic patterns
Implementation of the Project would have a new significant effect pertaining to traffic and circulation, or
a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant traffic and circulation effect if it
would:

Traffic Load and Capacity Thresholds
1.     At a study, signalized intersection which is located outside the Downtown area1, the project
would cause the level of service (LOS) to degrade to worse than LOS D (i.e., LOS E);
2.      At a study, signalized intersection outside the Downtown area where the level of service is LOS
E, the project would cause the total intersection average vehicle delay to increase by four (4) or more
seconds or degrade to worse than LOS E (i.e., LOS F);
3.      At a study, signalized intersection for all areas where the level of service is LOS E, the project
would cause an increase in the average delay for any of the critical movements of six (6) seconds or more
or degrade to worse than LOS E (i.e., LOS F);
4.     At a study, signalized intersection for all areas where the level of service is LOS F, the project
would cause (a) the overall volume-to-capacity ("V/C") ratio to increase 0.01 or more or (b) the critical
movement V/C ratio to increase 0.02 or more;
5.        Result in substantially increased travel times for AC Transit buses;

Traffic Safety Thresholds
10.      Directly or indirectly cause or expose roadway users (e.g., motorists, pedestrians, bus riders,
bicyclists) to a permanent and substantial transportation hazard due to a new or existing physical design
feature or incompatible uses;
11.       Directly or indirectly result in a permanent substantial decrease in pedestrian safety;
12.       Directly or indirectly result in a permanent substantial decrease in bicyclist safety;
13.       Directly or indirectly result in a permanent substantial decrease in bus rider safety;

Other Thresholds
17.     Result in a substantial, though temporary, adverse effect on the circulation system during
construction of the project.

Cumulative Impacts
18.    A project's contribution to cumulative impacts is considered "considerable" (i.e., significant)
when the project exceeds at least one of the thresholds listed above in a future year scenario.

Intersections

Existing Conditions
Existing conditions were evaluated as a baseline to determine the extent of the impacts of the Project on
today's conditions (November 2011), without completion of the Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic
Retrofit Project. Traffic operations for baseline conditions at study intersections are shown in Table 3-7.
As shown, the Project would result in increased delays and lower levels of service at some intersections

    The Downtown area is defined in the Land Use and Transportation Element of the General Plan (page 67) as the
    area generally bounded by the West Grand Avenue to the north, Lake Merritt and Channel Park to the east, the
    Oakland Estuary to the south, and I-980/Brush Street to the west.

intersections would be less than significant.

Existing Conditions plus Improvements
An evaluation was performed to determine the effects of the Project for conditions after completion of the
Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic Retrofit Project, which is anticipated to be completed by summer
of 2013. 2 Study intersections for the Project area and plus-Project traffic volumes are shown in Figure 3-
4.Traffic operations for conditions after completion of the Caltrans' High Street Overhead Seismic
Retrofit Project are shown in Table 3-8. As, the Project would result in a significant impact at the High
Street & Coliseum Way intersection, where the Project would degrade traffic operations to LOS E during
the p.m. peak hour. The Project impacts at this intersection would be significant.

    Traffic volumes for existing conditions were increased for all movements by 2% to produce traffic volumes for
    2013 conditions, after completion of the Seismic Retrofit Project.

Mitigation Measure
MM Traf-1:            High Street & Coliseum Way. Optimize the signal timing at the intersection of High
                      Street & Coliseum Way. Coordinate the signal timing changes at this intersection with
                      adjacent intersection that are in the same signal coordination group. To implement this
                      measure, the Project sponsor shall submit the following to City of Oakland's
                      Transportation Service Division and Caltrans for review and approval:
                      a) Only if signal modernization is required: Plans, Specifications, and Estimates
                         (PS&E) to modify the intersection. All elements shall be designed to Caltrans
                         standards in effect at the time of construction and all new and upgraded signals
                         should include these enhancements. All other facilities supporting vehicle travel and
                         alternative modes through the intersection should be brought up to both Caltrans
                         standards and ADA standards (according to Federal and State Access Board
                         guideline) at the time of construction.
                      b) Signal timing plans for the signals in the coordination group.

                      c) The Project sponsor shall fund, prepare and install the approved plans and
                         improvements.
This change would improve traffic operations to LOS D with 52.7 seconds of delay for the p.m. peak
hour, and would mitigate the impact of the Project to less-than-significant (Less than Significant with
Mitigation).

Cumulative Conditions
Future conditions were evaluated to determine the extent to which impacts would result from the Project
in combination with past, present and other reasonably foreseeable future projects. Reasonably
foreseeable projects included general growth anticipated in the Bay Area as reflected in the land use data
sets for future years in the Alameda Countywide Travel Model with land uses that include the Oakland
Central Estuary Plan, as described in the Central Estuary Implementation Guide Traffic Forecasting
Report. Study intersections for the Project area and future cumulative plus-Project traffic volumes are
shown in Figure 3-5. Traffic operations for future (2035) conditions are shown in Table 3-9.

As shown in Table 3-9, the Project would result in a significant impact at the following intersections,
which would operate at LOS F without the Project and the Project would cause either the overall volume-
to-capacity ("V/C") ratio to increase 0.01 or more or the critical movement V/C ratio to increase 0.02 or
more:
    ·   42nd Ave. & International Blvd. during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours
    ·   High St. & International Blvd. during the p.m. peak hour
    ·   High St. & San Leandro St. during the a.m. peak hour
    ·   High St. & Coliseum Way. during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours
The Project's impacts at these intersections would be significant.
The High St. & Oakport St. intersection would operate at LOS D after implementation of the Project. The
impact at that intersection would not be significant (Less than Significant).

Mitigation Measures
MM Traf-2:       42nd Avenue & International Boulevard. Modify the northwest bound and southeast
                 bound approaches on International Boulevard at the intersection of 42nd Avenue &
                 International Boulevard by adding a left turn lane in each direction. The resulting
                 approach lanes would consist of two left-turn lanes one through lane and one through-
                 right lane. Optimize intersection signal timing. Coordinate the signal timing changes at
                 this intersection with adjacent intersection that are in the same signal coordination group.
                 To implement this measure, the Project sponsor shall submit the following to City of
                 Oakland's Transportation Service Division and Caltrans for review and approval:
                 a) Only if signal modernization is required: Plans, Specifications, and Estimates
                    (PS&E) to modify the intersection. All elements shall be designed to Caltrans
                    standards in effect at the time of construction and all new and upgraded signals
                    should include these enhancements. All other facilities supporting vehicle travel and
                    alternative modes through the intersection should be brought up to both Caltrans
                    standards and ADA standards (according to Federal and State Access Board
                    guideline) at the time of construction.
                 b) Signal timing plans for the signals in the coordination group.
                 c) The Project sponsor shall fund, prepare and install the approved plans and
                    improvements.
A straight line interpolation of total intersection delay between Existing plus Improvements and
Cumulative conditions indicates that mitigation at this intersection may be required by the time the
Project is constructed (2016). Investigation of the need for this mitigation shall be studied at the time of
construction and every 3 years thereafter until 2035 or until the mitigation measure is implemented,
whichever occurs first.
After mitigation, the intersection would operate at LOS F during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours; however,
the V/C ratios for the entire intersection and the critical lane movements would be less than or equal to
those that would occur without the Project. This mitigation measure would reduce the impact of the
Project to less-than- significant. (Less than Significant with Mitigation)
MM Traf-3:       High Street & International Boulevard. Optimize the signal timing at the intersections
                 of High Street and International Boulevard. Coordinate the signal timing changes at this
                 intersection with adjacent intersections that are in the same signal coordination group. To

A straight line interpolation of total intersection delay between Existing plus Improvements and
Cumulative conditions indicates that mitigation at this intersection may be required by the time the
Project is constructed (2016). Investigation of the need for this mitigation shall be studied at time of
construction and every 3 years thereafter until 2035, or until the mitigation measure is implemented,
whichever occurs first.
After mitigation, the intersection would operate at LOS F during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours; however,
the V/C ratios for the entire intersection and the critical lane movements would be less than or equal to
those that would occur without the Project. This mitigation measure would reduce the impact of the
Project to less-than-significant. (Less than Significant with Mitigation)

MM Traf-5:       High Street & Coliseum Way. Modify the northwest bound approach on Coliseum Way
                 to provide one left-through lane and one through-right lane. Optimize intersection signal
                 timing. Coordinate the signal timing changes at this intersection with adjacent
                 intersection that are in the same signal coordination group. To implement this measure,
                 the Project sponsor shall submit the following to City of Oakland's Transportation
                 Service Division and Caltrans for review and approval:
                 a) Only if signal modernization is required: Plans, Specifications, and Estimates
                    (PS&E) to modify the intersection. All elements shall be designed to Caltrans
                    standards in effect at the time of construction and all new and upgraded signals
                    should include these enhancements. All other facilities supporting vehicle travel and
                    alternative modes through the intersection should be brought up to both Caltrans
                    standards and ADA standards (according to Federal and State Access Board
                    guideline) at the time of construction.
                 b) Signal timing plans for the signals in the coordination group.
                 c) The Project sponsor shall fund, prepare and install the approved plans and
                    improvements.
A straight line interpolation of total intersection delay between Existing plus Improvements and
Cumulative conditions indicates that mitigation at this intersection may be required by 2024.
Investigation of the need for this mitigation shall be studied at time of construction and every 3 years
thereafter until 2035 or until the mitigation measure is implemented, whichever occurs first.
After mitigation, the intersection would operate at LOS C during the a.m. peak hour and LOS D during
the p.m. peak hour in compliance with City of Oakland operating standards. This mitigation measure
would reduce the impact of the Project to less-than-significant. (Less than Significant with Mitigation)

Potential Effects of East Bay Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
The BRT project is not approved and not fully funded. Therefore, it is not included in the future baseline
conditions as it is not reasonably foreseeable. Nevertheless, it is discussed as follows.
Within the vicinity of the study area, the East Bay BRT project would run along International Boulevard.
That project would convert one travel lane in each direction to BRT-only operations along International
Boulevard. The dedicated BRT lanes would reduce lane capacity at the study intersections along
International Boulevard. The Project was analyzed with the assumption that the East Bay BRT would not
be constructed. If the East Bay BRT project were to be constructed, the impacts at intersections on
International Boulevard would be considerably greater, as traffic capacity would decrease. This finding is
consistent with the findings of the Central Estuary Implementation Guide Traffic Forecasting Report. It
would be the responsibility of the BRT project, if funded and approved, to mitigate any of its potential
impacts.

3 ­ TRAFFIC AND CIRCULATION


Transit

Local and Trans-Bay Transit Service
No transit lines currently travel along the streets that would be potentially affected by the Project. Trans
bay transit lines S and SB travel along I-880. Local Lines 1, 1R, 14, 47, and all-nighter Line 801 travel
along International Boulevard. The Project would not substantially increase travel times for AC Transit
buses. Therefore, the Project's impacts on local and Trans-bay transit service would be less than
significant. (Less than Significant)

Traffic Safety

Safety for Roadway Users
The Project is expected to improve traffic safety for all modes of travel. Therefore, the Project's impacts
on traffic safety would be less than significant. (Less than Significant)

Pedestrian Safety
Pedestrian crossing distances would be increased at the following crossings:
    ·     High Street & Coliseum Way east leg, where the crossing distance will be increased from 64 feet
          to 88 feet. A pedestrian refuge island will be installed at this crossing with pedestrian signals and
          pedestrian pushbutton.
    ·     High Street & Oakport Street west leg, where the crossing distance will be increased from 93 feet
          to 100 feet. A pedestrian refuge island will be installed at this crossing with pedestrian signals
          and pedestrian pushbutton.
These increased crossing distances should not result in a substantial decrease in pedestrian safety as the
crossing would be controlled by traffic signals.
Pedestrian safety would be improved by the following Project features:
    ·     New sidewalks and pedestrian crosswalks will be installed along the northwest side of High
          Street from Oakport Street to Coliseum Way, where no pedestrian access is currently allowed.
    ·     Two new pedestrian crosswalks will be installed across Alameda Avenue at the Howard Street/
          Jensen Street intersection.
The Project's impacts on pedestrian safety would be less than significant. (Less than Significant)

Bicyclist Safety
Bicyclist safety will be improved by the addition of bike lanes along both sides of Alameda Avenue and
42nd Avenue from the I-880 southbound exit ramp to the western terminus of the Project at the Home
Depot driveway. The elimination of the skewed Alameda Avenue connection to the High Street &
Oakport Street intersection will improve safety for bicyclists. Therefore, the Project's impacts on bicyclist
safety would be less than significant. (Less than Significant)

Bus Rider Safety
Bus rider safety would not be affected by the Project as no existing bus facilities would be removed.
Therefore, the Project's impacts on bus rider safety would be less than significant. (Less than
Significant)

Construction
Construction of the Project may result in a temporary, adverse effect on the circulation system; however,
construction will be staged in a manner that should minimize the adverse effects and those effects should
not be substantial. The conditions of approval for this Project will ensure that construction effects be
minimized and the Project's impacts of construction on the circulation system would be less than
significant. (Less than Significant)


Planning-Related Non-CEQA Issues

Parking
The Court of Appeal has held that parking is not part of the permanent physical environment, that parking
conditions change over time as people change their travel patterns, and that unmet parking demand
created by a project need not be considered a significant environmental impact under CEQA unless it
would cause significant secondary effects. Similarly, the December 2009 amendments to the State
CEQA Guidelines (which become effective March 18, 2010) removed parking from the State's
Environmental Checklist (Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines) as an environmental factor to be
considered under CEQA. Parking supply/demand varies by time of day, day of week, and seasonally. As
parking demand increases faster than the supply, parking prices rise to reach equilibrium between supply
and demand. Decreased availability and increased costs result in changes to people's mode and pattern of
travel. However, the City of Oakland, in its review of the proposed Project, wants to ensure that the
Project's provision of parking spaces along with measures to lessen parking demand (by encouraging the
use of non-auto travel modes) would result in minimal adverse effects to Project occupants and visitors,
and that any secondary effects (such as on air quality due to drivers searching for parking spaces) would
be minimized. As such, although not required by CEQA, parking conditions are evaluated in this
document as a non-CEQA topic for informational purposes.
Parking deficits may be associated with secondary physical environmental impacts, such as air quality
and noise effects, caused by congestion resulting from drivers circling as they look for a parking space.
However, the absence of a ready supply of parking spaces, combined with available alternatives to auto
travel (e.g., transit service, shuttles, taxis, bicycles or travel by foot), may induce drivers to shift to other
modes of travel, or change their overall travel habits. Any such resulting shifts to alternative modes of
travel would be in keeping with the City's Public Transit and Alternative Modes Policy (sometimes
referred to as the "Transit First" policy).
Additionally, regarding potential secondary effects, cars circling and looking for a parking space in areas
of limited parking supply is typically a temporary condition, often offset by a reduction in vehicle trips
due to others who are aware of constrained parking conditions in a given area. Hence, any secondary
environmental impacts that might result from a shortfall in parking in the vicinity of the proposed Project
are considered less than significant.
This document evaluates if the Project's estimated parking demand (both Project-generated and Project-
displaced) would be met by the Project's proposed parking supply or by the existing parking supply

within a reasonable walking distance of the Project site. Project-displaced parking results from the
Project's removal of standard on-street parking, City or Redevelopment Agency owned/controlled parking
and/or legally required off-street parking (non-open-to-the-public parking which is legally required).
The Project would not remove parking spaces or cause the need for more parking spaces.

Transit Ridership
Transit load is not part of the permanent physical environment; transit service changes over time as
people change their travel patterns. Therefore, the effect of the proposed Project on transit ridership need
not be considered a significant environmental impact under CEQA unless it would cause significant
secondary effects, such as causing the construction of new permanent transit facilities which in turn
causes physical effects on the environment. Furthermore, an increase in transit ridership is an
environmental benefit, not an impact. One of the goals of the Land Use and Transportation Element of
the Oakland General Plan is to promote transit ridership. The City of Oakland, however, in its review of
the proposed Project, wants to understand the Project's potential effect on transit ridership. As such,
although not required by CEQA, transit ridership is evaluated in this document as a non-CEQA topic for
informational purposes.
This document evaluates whether the Project would exceed any of the following:
    ·    Increase the average ridership on AC Transit lines by three (3) percent at bus stops where the
         average load factor with the Project in place would exceed 125% over a peak thirty minute
         period;
    ·    Increase the peak hour average ridership on BART by three (3) percent where the passenger
         volume would exceed the standing capacity of BART trains; or
    ·    Increase the peak hour average ridership at a BART station by three (3) percent where average
         waiting time at fare gates would exceed one minute.]
The Project is not expected to have a significant effect on transit ridership as it is not a development
project generating new vehicle trips.

Summary of the 2001 Negative Declaration

2001 Setting
The 2001 Neg. Dec described the existing physical and regulatory setting for air quality, as following:
    "Air quality is controlled through the attainment and maintenance of ambient air quality standards
    and enforcement of emission limits. Pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act of 1970 and its subsequent
    amendments, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established national ambient air
    quality standards for six air pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides,
    lead, and sulfur dioxides. In addition to national standards, the Project area is also regulated by state
    standards established by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Many of these standards are
    more stringent than the corresponding national standards.
    The San Francisco Bay Area, including the Project site, is currently designated as a nonattainment
    area for ozone on the federal level and for ozone and suspended particulates (PMIO) on the state
    level. .
    The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) is the agency responsible for regulating
    air pollutant emissions within the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin. Responsible agencies must
    develop plans that demonstrate how they plan to meet the federal and state standards. The plans
    concentrate on stationary and mobile source control measures that will reduce the amount of air
    pollutants being emitted. Some of the control measures (e.g., construction-related measures) can be
    enforced on specific projects, such as the 42nd Avenue/High Street Project.
    The plan that state agencies develop to meet national standards is called the State Implementation
    Plan (SIP). The BAAQMD has prepared the San Francisco Bay Area Ozone Attainment Plan for the
    One-Hour National Ozone Standard (Adopted June 1999) and has submitted this plan to the CARB
    for incorporation into the SIP. The BAAQMD has also developed the 1997 Bay Area Clean Air Plan
    to document how it plans to meet state standards."

2001 Neg. Dec. Environmental Conclusions
The 2001 Neg. Dec. concluded that air quality-related impacts from the Project were expected to be the
generation of emissions during construction of the project, and during the life of the Project due to
changes in motor vehicle traffic. These previously identified environmental effects are described below.

Construction Phase
The 2001 Neg. Dec. found that construction-related emissions are temporary and vary day-to-day,
depending on level of activity. Particulate matter was the pollutant of greatest concern resulting from
construction activities. The potential for fugitive dust (i.e., particulate matter) to be emitted during Project
construction as a result of earth moving, grading, and material hauling operations was identified.
At that time, the BAAQMD did not consider construction emissions of particulate matter to be significant
for a project if certain control measures were included in project planning. In general, larger construction
areas generate more particulate matter emissions and thus require more control measures. The 2001 Neg.
Dec. concluded that, since specifications for the construction contract will include dust control measures

that meet BAAQMD requirements; there would be no significant construction-phase impacts. The
following mitigation measure was recommended:
MM Air-1:          Construction-Period Air Quality Controls: The following control measures should be
                   implemented during Project construction:
                   d) Water all exposed soil at the construction site at least twice a day.
                   e) Cover haul trucks containing dirt and debris.
                   f) Pave areas as soon as possible.
                   g) Sweep daily all paved access roads, parking areas and staging areas at the
                      construction site.
This mitigation measure is replaced by Standard Condition of Approval Air-1 (see discussion, below).

Operation Phase

Regional Emissions Analysis
The 2001 Neg. Dec. found that implementation of the proposed project's access improvements would not
result in an increase of regional emissions over projected levels without the project. The Project was not
expected to generate any additional motor vehicle trips. Its main purpose is to improve access for
vehicles traveling to and from the cities of Oakland and Alameda via 42nd Avenue and High Street from
1-880. In addition, conditions may improve for localized traffic in the Project area that is not using 1-880.
These improvements in access may actually decrease regional air pollutant emissions as a result of less
vehicle queuing and delay.

Localized Carbon Monoxide Analysis
At the time of publication of the 2001 Neg. Dec., a project located in a federal or state carbon monoxide
(CO) non-attainment or maintenance area was required to show that the project would not generate CO
emissions that would produce new CO standard violations, worsen existing violations, or delay timely
attainment of CO standards. A CO analysis for the Project was conducted, following guidance provided in
the Transportation Project-Level Carbon Monoxide Protocol (Protocol) developed by Caltrans and the
Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis (December 1997). At the time,
the Project was in an attainment/maintenance area for CO and did not require a micro-scale CO modeling
analysis. Using the Protocol criteria, it was concluded that the Project would not worsen localized air
quality within the Project area:
    ·      The Project would not significantly increase the number of vehicles operating in cold start mode
           (i.e., starting a vehicle with a cold engine).
    ·      Increases in traffic volumes as a result of the Project would not impact roadway operations in
           such a way as to significantly impact air quality.
    ·      The Project would not worsen traffic flow.
    ·      The Project would not impact signalized intersections that operate at level of service (LOS) E or
           F, or lead to the worsening of LOS to E or F for a signalized intersection.
The 2001 Neg. Dec predicted that by the year 2025, traffic volumes on most streets in the Project area
would remain the same or be decreased if the Project were to be implemented as compared to a no-build
situation. Traffic volumes on two roadways (42nd Avenue and the 1-880 northbound on-ramp at 42nd
Avenue) were expected to increase by 100 to 450 vehicles per travel direction. This increase in traffic


PAGE 4-2                 ADDENDUM TO THE 42ND AVENUE/HIGH STREET ACCESS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT NEGATIVE DECLARATION
                                                                                               4 - AIR QUALITY

volumes would exceed a 5% screening threshold as used in the Protocol methodology to signify a
potentially significant increase. However, this increase in traffic volumes was not found to result in
significant air quality impacts because the roadways would have adequate operational capacity to accept
the additional vehicles without worsening traffic flow (i.e., reducing travel speeds) or affecting level of
service.
The potential for significant air quality impacts (i.e., CO violations) typically occur at signalized
intersections, especially those that operate at LOS E or F. In general, by year 2025 the intersections in the
Project area (except the Coliseum Way/High Street intersection) were found to operate at a satisfactory
LOS (i.e., LOS C or better). Under the no-build condition, the intersection of Coliseum Way and High
Street would operate at a LOS F during both AM and PM peak traffic hours. Construction of the Project
was found to significantly improve operations at this intersection, resulting in a LOS B. Improvements at
other intersections were found to be less pronounced; in many cases the LOS would remain the same but
the average total delay per vehicle would be less.

Odors
Based on a list of facilities developed by the BAAQMD known to emit objectionable odors, the Project
was not found to be the type of project expected to generate significant odors. It was not anticipated that
exhaust generated during construction and operation of the Project would create a significant amount of
odor emissions.


Existing (2011) SETTING

Changed Circumstances
Air quality conditions in the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin have improved significantly, and ambient
concentrations of air pollutants and the number of days during which the region exceeds air quality
standards have fallen dramatically. Exceedance of air quality standards occurs primarily during
meteorological conditions conducive to high pollution levels, such as cold, windless winter nights or hot,
sunny summer afternoons.
    ·   Ozone levels, measured by peak concentrations and the number of days over the State 1-hour
        standard, have declined substantially as a result of aggressive programs by the BAAQMD and
        other regional, state and federal agencies. The reduction of peak concentrations represents
        progress in improving public health; however, the Bay Area still exceeds the State standard for 1-
        hour ozone.
    ·   Levels of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) in the Bay Area have exceeded state standards at
        least two times per year during the past three years. The Bay Area is considered a non-attainment
        area for PM10 and PM2.5 relative to the state standard, and unclassified for the federal standards.
    ·   No exceedance of the State or federal carbon monoxide (CO) standards has been recorded at any
        of the region's monitoring stations since 1991. The Bay Area is currently considered a
        maintenance area for State and federal CO standards.
Toxic air contaminants (TACs) are not criteria pollutants, but are associated with health-related effects
and have appreciable concentrations in the Bay Area. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) have identified over 800 substances that are emitted into
the air that may affect human health. Some of these substances are considered to be carcinogens, while
others are known to have other adverse health effects. As part of ongoing efforts to identify and assess


ADDENDUM TO THE 42ND AVENUE/HIGH STREET ACCESS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT NEGATIVE DECLARATION              PAGE 4-3
4 ­ AIR QUALITY

potential health risks to the public, BAAQMD has collected and compiled air toxic emissions data from
industrial and commercial sources of air pollution throughout the Bay Area. Monitoring data and
emissions inventory of toxic air contaminants helps the BAAQMD determine health risk to Bay Area
residents. The 2003 emissions inventory shows that emissions of many TACs are decreasing in the Bay
Area.
Ambient monitoring concentrations of TACs indicates that pollutants emitted primarily from motor
vehicles (1,3-butadiene and benzene) account for slightly over one-half of the average calculated cancer
risk from ambient air in the Bay Area. According to the BAAQMD, ambient benzene levels declined
dramatically in 1996 with the advent of Phase 2 reformulated gasoline. Due to this reduction, the
calculated average cancer risk based on monitoring results has been reduced to 143 in one million.
However, this risk does not include the risk resulting from exposure to diesel particulate matter or other
compounds not monitored. Although not specifically monitored, recent studies indicate that exposure to
diesel particulate matter may contribute significantly to cancer risk (approximately 500 ­ 700 in one
million) that is greater than all other measured TACs combined.


Existing (2011) Regulatory Setting

Air Quality Standards
Both State and federal governments have established health-based Ambient Air Quality Standards
(AAQS) for six air pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO); ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur
dioxide (SO2), lead (Pb) and suspended particulate matter (PM). In addition, the State has set standards
for sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride and visibility-reducing particles. These standards are
designed to protect public health and welfare with a reasonable margin of safety. In addition to primary
and secondary AAQS, the State of California has established a set of episode criteria for O3, CO, NO2,
SO2 and PM. These criteria refer to episode levels representing periods of short-term exposure to air
pollutants that actually threaten public health. Health effects are progressively more severe as pollutant
levels increase. California and national Ambient Air Quality Standards for the criteria pollutants are listed
in Table 4.1.

As of 2009, the Bay Area still exceeded the State standard for 1-hour ozone and is considered a non-
attainment area for this pollutant, and is considered a non-attainment area for PM10 and PM2.5 relative to
the State standard and unclassified for the federal standards. The Bay Area is considered a maintenance
area for State and federal CO standards, and attainment or unclassified for all other pollutants under the
more stringent State standards (see Table 4-2).

California Air Resources Board (CARB) Air Quality and Land Use Handbook
In April 2005, the CARB prepared the Air Quality and Land Use Handbook which is intended to serve as
a general reference guide for evaluating and reducing air pollution impacts associated with new projects
that go through the land use decision-making process. The CARB Handbook recommends that planning
agencies strongly consider proximity to these sources when finding new locations for "sensitive" land
uses such as homes, medical facilities, daycare centers, schools and playgrounds.
Air pollution sources of concern include freeways, rail yards, ports, refineries, distribution centers,
chrome plating facilities, dry cleaners and large gasoline service stations. Key recommendations in the
Handbook include taking steps to avoid siting new, sensitive land uses (including residences, day care
centers, playgrounds or medical facilities):
    ·      Within 500 feet of a freeway, urban roads with 100,000 vehicles/day or rural roads with 50,000
           vehicles/day.
    ·      Within 1,000 feet of a major service and maintenance rail yard.
    ·      Immediately downwind of ports (in the most heavily impacted zones) and petroleum refineries.
    ·      Within 300 feet of any dry cleaning operation (for operations with two or more machines, provide
           500 feet).

    ·   Within 300 feet of a large gas station (defined as a facility with a throughput of 3.6 million
        gallons per year or greater).
The Handbook specifically states that its recommendations are advisory, and acknowledges land use
agencies have to balance other considerations, including housing and transportation needs, economic
development priorities, and other quality of life issues.
The Project site is not a sensitive land use (i.e., does not include homes, medical facilities, day-care
centers, schools or playgrounds), and thus these recommendations do not apply.

Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Ozone Attainment Plan
The BAAQMD prepared the 2009 Ozone Attainment Plan (OAP) to address non-attainment of the
National 1-hour ozone standard in the Bay Area Air Basin. The purpose of the 2009 OAP is to:
    ·   Update the Bay Area 2005 Ozone Strategy in accordance with the requirements of the CCAA to
        implement "all feasible measures" to reduce ozone;
    ·   Consider the impacts of ozone control measures on particulate matter (PM), air toxics, and
        greenhouse gases in a single, integrated plan;
    ·   Review progress on improving air quality in recent years;
    ·   Establish emission control measures to be adopted or implemented in the 2009-2012 timeframe.
The BAAQMD's 2009 Ozone Attainment Plan (OAP) contains district-wide control measures to reduce
ozone precursor emissions (e.g., ROG and NOx) and particulate matter. Ozone, in particular, results from
the reaction of organic gases (ROG) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) in the atmosphere. To reduce ozone, its
precursors (ROG and NOx) are regulated. Similarly, the BAAQMD prepared the 2009 Clean Air Plan to
address non-attainment of the California AAQS.

BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines and Thresholds of Significance
On May of 2011 the BAAQMD Board of Directors adopted their latest version of Thresholds of
Significance for use in determining the significance of projects' environmental effects under the
California Environmental Quality Act (Thresholds), and published their latest version of CEQA
Guidelines for consideration by lead agencies. The Thresholds lowered the previous (1999) threshold of
significance for annual emissions of Reactive Organic Gases (ROG), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and
particulate matter exhaust (PM10), and set a standard for smaller particulates (PM2.5) and fugitive dust.
The 2011 CEQA Guidelines include methodologies for evaluating risks and hazards for the siting of
stationary sources and of sensitive receptors.
Projects that do not comply with the latest version of the Thresholds of Significance will normally be
determined to have a significant effect on the environment for purposes of CEQA, and projects that
comply with the CEQA Thresholds of Significance normally will be determined to have a less-than-
significant effect on the environment for purposes of CEQA. The 2011 CEQA Guidelines are intended to
be viewed as minimum considerations for analyzing air quality impacts. Lead agencies are encouraged to
tailor air quality impact analyses to meet the needs of the local community and may conduct refined
analyses that utilize more sophisticated models, more precise input data, innovative mitigation measures,
and/or other features. The Guidelines contain screening criteria to determine projects may have
potentially significant impacts requiring detailed analysis, and assessment methods and mitigation
measures for operational-related, local community risk and hazards, local carbon monoxide (CO), odors,
construction-related, and plan-level impacts.

Although not legally required, in order to provide more information to the public and decision makers,
and in the interest of being conservative, the following analysis relies on the new guidance and thresholds
for air quality impacts as recommended by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)
and now utilized by the City of Oakland.


Potential Effects

Significance Thresholds
Implementation of the Project would have a new significant effects regarding air quality, or a substantial
increase in the severity of previously identified significant air quality effect if it would:
a) During project construction result in average daily emissions of 54 pounds per day of ROG, NOx, or
   PM2.5 or 82 pounds per day of PM10;
b) During project operation result in average daily emissions of 54 pounds per day of ROG, NOx, or
   PM2.5 or 82 pounds per day of PM10; or result in maximum annual emissions of 10 tons per year of
   ROG, NOx, or PM2.5 or 15 tons per year of PM10;
c) Contribute to carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations exceeding the California Ambient Air Quality
   Standards (CAAQS) of nine parts per million (ppm) averaged over eight hours and 20 ppm for one
   hour 3;
d) During either project construction or project operation expose persons by siting a new source or a
   new sensitive receptor to substantial levels of Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs) resulting in (a) a
   cancer risk level greater than 10 in one million, (b) a non-cancer risk (chronic or acute) hazard index
   greater than 1.0, or (c) an increase of annual average PM2.5 of greater than 0.3 micrograms per cubic
   meter [NOTE: Pursuant to the BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines, when siting new TAC sources consider
   receptors located within 1,000 feet, and when siting new sensitive receptors consider TAC sources
   located within 1,000 feet including, but not limited to, stationary sources, freeways, major roadways
   (10,000 or greater vehicles per day), truck distribution centers, ports, and rail lines. For this
   threshold, sensitive receptors include residential uses, schools, parks, daycare centers, nursing homes,
   and medical centers.] or;
e) Frequently and for a substantial duration, create or expose sensitive receptors to substantial
   objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people [NOTE: For this threshold, sensitive
   receptors include residential uses, schools, daycare centers, nursing homes, and medical centers (but
   not parks).].
f) During either project operation or project construction expose persons, by siting a new source or a
   new sensitive receptor, to substantial levels of TACs resulting in (a) a cancer risk level greater than



3
    Pursuant to BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines, localized CO concentrations should be estimated for projects in which
    (a) project-generated traffic would conflict with an applicable congestion management program established by the
    county congestion management agency or (b) project-generated traffic would increase traffic volumes at affected
    intersections to more than 44,000 vehicles per hour (or 24,000 vehicles per hour where vertical and/or horizontal
    mixing is substantially limited, such as tunnels, parking garages, bridge underpasses, natural or urban street
    canyons, and below-grade roadways). In Oakland, only the MacArthur Maze portion of Interstate 580 exceeds the
    44,000 vehicles per hour screening criteria.

Public Comment
There was no one present for public comment.

Commercial Lease Transactions
Mayor Rosenthal stated that she had discussed with Attorney Coblentz the issue of the
Village not receiving sales tax revenues from non-retail businesses looking to locate in
retail areas. She asked Mr. Coblentz to research the issue and make a report to the
Committee of the Whole to decide whether to take the issue to the Northwest Municipal
Conference or the Illinois Municipal League to pursue in Springfield.

Mr. Coblentz reported that Florida, Kentucky and Arizona all apply a sales tax to
commercial rents. He noted that as a home rule unit of government, the Village of
Deerfield has broad taxing powers but cannot impose a tax upon occupations. He noted
that a tax on commercial rents would be an occupation tax on landlords. Because of this,
legislative action would be required at the State level.
Mr. Coblentz stated that such a tax, however, is not out of line with other occupation
taxes specifically allowed by the State, such as taxes on copy machine leases and
intellectual property.

Mr. Coblentz noted that his memo to the Board was narrowly tailored to educate
lawmakers on the issue of non-sales tax generating businesses wanting to open in
predominantly retail districts. He stated that a set policy on the matter would create a
legal policy to minimize the appearance of case-by case decision making.

Trustee Jester stated that it was important to stress that the proposal focused only on
nonretail businesses in retail business districts.
C.O.W; May 13, 2013


Mr. Coblentz noted that the application of the tax would have to show reasonable
justification and that business that are mixed retail and nonretail could have their
commercial lease tax reduced by the amount of sales tax generated.

Trustee Struthers stated that the policy would work if implemented statewide, but if it
only applied in Deerfield it could deter businesses from coming into the community.

Trustee Farkas questioned whether such a tax would apply to office uses. He also noted
that the comparison to Florida's tax structure is not equal because Florida does not have
an income tax. He stated that he would favor the policy only if it was statewide.

Attorney Coblentz noted that the policy would only apply to central business districts and
not impact office centers. Mayor Rosenthal noted that the point of the proposal would be
for a state-wide policy only.

Trustee Nadler noted that such a tax would leave the current zoning intact.

Trustee Benton stated that he would like to see it explored further.

Mayor Rosenthal stated that the policy would be presented at a regular Board meeting for
referral to the Northwest Municipal Conference.

Possible Licensing Agreement
Village Manager Street reported that a company has taken an interest in the "Kissing"
and "No Kissing" signs that were put up at the METRA station in the 1970s. He stated
that the images were copyrighted by the Village in the 1980s. He noted that the firm
representing designer Kate Spade is interested in a license agreement to use the images.


The Village Board requested that Manager Street pursue negotiations.

BYOB Liquor License Classification
Manager Street reported that Bobby's and Rhapsody Cafe have both contacted the
Village requesting a BYOB liquor license to allow patrons to bring their own beer or
wine.

Assistant to the Village Manager Lichterman reported that staff's research found that
Lake Forest, Northbrook and Northfield all have a BYOB liquor license class. He noted
that a narrowly tailored ordinance that includes safeguards, such as drink service limits,
could legalize and regulate this practice in Deerfield. He stated that an ordinance would
allow patrons to bring their own beer or wine and would require that it not leave the
premises unless in a sealed bag as required in State law. The license would be free for
restaurants that already have a Class C or Class E liquor license, which are licenses for
restaurants. It would cost $250 if the restaurant does not have a Class C or Class E
license.

Trustee Farkas noted that a BYOB liquor license could keep costs down for diners and
benefit local grocers. Trustee Seiden inquired if restaurants could charge corkage fees.
C.O.W; May 13, 2013


Mr. Lichterman noted that it would be allowed in the ordinance and be up to restaurants
to set the amount.

Trustee Nadler asked if restaurants would be in favor of such a policy. Manager Street
reported that two restaurants have specifically requested that the Village allow BYOB,
but that additional input would be sought.

Trustee Farkas asked Chief Sliozis if he was concerned about servers at BYOB-only
establishments handling liquor. Chief Sliozis noted that all servers would have to go
through the same training.

Mayor Rosenthal noted that she thought limiting the amount of alcohol that could be
brought in at one bottle of wine per person was too high. She stated that it could be more
difficult for servers to stop service to patrons who have over consumed and suggested
lowering the amount of alcohol permitted per person.


Assistant to the Village Manager Lichterman reported that BASSETT training for servers
would be required as an added safeguard. Mayor Rosenthal stated that for restaurants
with only a BYOB license, the added training could be beneficial.

It was the consensus of the Committee of the Whole that staff should perform more
research and bring a report to the Village Board.

U.S. Bank Corner Park
Mr. Lichterman reported that the Village's lease on the U.S. Bank Corner Park started on
April 1. Since that time, staff, with the assistance of a local landscape contractor and
Mary Oppenheim, has improved safety at the site by leveling the paths, pruning and
planting. He stated that staff is now looking for guidance on how to proceed at the site.
Improvements performed by the end of next year are eligible for reimbursement if the
lease is terminated early. He inquired if staff should hire a consultant to develop a site
plan to take to the various commissions. He noted a proposal from Rosbourough Partners
was included with the memo to the Board.

Mayor Rosenthal noted that Mary Oppenheim is a landscape architect and worked with
staff in determining how to perform the improvements. Ms. Oppenheim stated that with
any park it is important to keep in mind site lines and seating. With the overgrowth
cleared out more people are using the area. She noted that the corner had been neglected
for a long time and the new improvements are a short-term fix, and a more long-term
solution is needed.

Trustee Nadler inquired about the cost of such a plan. Mayor Rosenthal stated that the
Village previously looked into purchasing the property, but the lease option has greatly
lowered the cost of controlling the parcel. She noted that she would like to see how the
park is used following the recent improvements.
C.O.W; May 13, 2013


Trustee Farkas stated that he thought this would be a good opportunity to find
sponsorship partners and volunteers to help fund improvements and maintenance at the
park. Ms. Oppenheim stated that she had spoken with officials from the Lions Club who
indicated that they would be willing to offer some funds and volunteers to the park. She
suggested developing a plan first so staff would know what kind of sponsorship level
would be appropriate for the project.

Mr. Lichterman reported that two plans could be developed, one that is scaled down and
a bigger plan that would incorporate public art. He said featured artists could be brought
in to perform demonstrations to make the art installations a community event.

Trustee Nadler suggested involving high school students in the process. Ms. Oppenheim
noted that the Earth Works group at Deerfield High School could do clean ups and
plantings. She suggested developing a plan now that can be further flushed out at a later
date.

Mr. Lichterman stated that if a plan is developed during the current fiscal year it could be
funded in the 2014 budget.

Mayor Rosenthal asked staff to research plans now and monitor the park's use over the
summer. Trustee Farkas concurred and asked staff to start looking into sponsorship
opportunities.

Board Device Training
Mr. Lichterman recalled that the Board packet devices are being replaced because the
current laptops are over 6 years old, no longer under warranty and replacement parts are
difficult to find. He noted the computers have surpassed their life expectancy and they
can no longer be serviced properly. All Board members turned in their laptops and
received an iPad.

Mayor Rosenthal reminded the Trustees that the new devices are for Village use only and
are subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

Computer Systems Coordinator Weiss provided training to the Village Board regarding
packet distribution and use of the devices.

Adjournment

Trustee Benton made a motion to adjourn. The motion was seconded by Trustee Seiden.

The meeting adjourned at 7:42 p.m.

Trustee Farkas noticed there was a charge for Just Tires in Mt. Prospect. He questioned why a
Deerfield business was not utilized. Mr. Street indicated the local Just Tires does not carry the
size tire that was needed.

TREASURER'S REPORT                             Village Treasurer Eric Burk presented highlights
                                               from the treasurer's report, the final for fiscal year
2013. He noted he will be back with fully adjusted and audited reports later in the year. Mr.
Burk indicated the non-home rule sales tax is down slightly due to a loss of business in town.
The Village has partially been able to offset the decrease through Walgreens. The hotel tax is
up, water and sewer revenues are up. Electric utility tax is down slightly, but consistent with last
year. The state income tax shown on the report represents two months' worth of payments.

REPORT ON DEPARTMENTAL                        Assistant to the Village Manager Andrew
OBJECTIVES ­ ADMINISTRATION                   Lichterman presented the administrative
                                              departmental objectives report. He highlighted
significant changes over the past six months. There have been some personnel changes and the
Village is currently recruiting for a Human Resources Coordinator. They will begin negotiations
with the Public Works union, Local 150, on a new contract. The first year of municipal
aggregation was a great success with Village residents saving approximately $2.3 million. The
year 2 rate is 0.0499 per kWh. MC Squared added a new feature so customers can now opt in
online. The department has made a strong effort to work with all businesses in town and is
focusing on business retention with the DBR Chamber of Commerce. The Village has also
trained all departments on electronic invoicing. They are also working on the new document
management system for the Village. The new system will help with FOIA requests.

Mr. Lichterman indicated commercial refuse and recycling franchising is a big initiative this
year. They have held two meetings with the business subcommittee and a public hearing is
scheduled for June 17, 2013. The Village is in contact with Bannockburn to possibly pursue a
joint RFP for commercial franchising.

Staff is working closely with CCHD and the DBR Chamber of Commerce to promote businesses
during the Lake Cook Road construction.

Staff has issued an RFP for janitorial and maintenance services for all four Village facilities.
The RFPs are due on May 31, 2013 and a contract is expected to go to the Board of Trustees on
June 17, 2013. The North Shore Electrical Aggregation Consortium is working on their second
initiative, electric vehicle charging stations. Proposals for this project are due on June 7, 2013.

Staff has negotiated a lease with U.S. Bank for the northeast corner park parcel. The 15-year
lease began April 1, 2013. The Public Works department and a local contractor have made
substantial safety improvements to the park. The next step is preparing design plans for
consideration by the Village Board.

The Fine Arts Commission has been working on planning the Fine Arts Festival. The Preview
Party will take place on May 31, 2013, and it the Fest will open to the public on June 1, 2013 and
June 2, 2013. Mr. Lichterman reported the event has expanded with an evening concert and
Board of Trustees Meeting

local restaurants will serve food and beverages at the event. There will also be live
entertainment until 9 p.m., on June 1. Mr. Lichterman noted the DBR Chamber of Commerce
has been very supportive and has done a great job in recruiting local restaurants and coordinating
the evening concert.

The Family Days Commission is working on the 50th year of Family Days. Fireworks will take
place on July 3 at Brickyards Park. The Family Days brochure will be mailed in June and will
describe all of the festivities on July 4th. The 19th season of the Farmers Market begins on June
8, 2013 and runs through October 12, 2013.

The Sustainability Commission appointed a new chairman. They are reviewing their mission
and goals for the future. They will set two 12-month goals and two 24-month goals.

The IT department has replaced and updated a lot of equipment throughout the Village. They
also updated the Village information channel on cable to a more modern design with emergency
notice capabilities. The Wastewater Reclamation Facility project has been demanding and is
substantially complete. Equipment was transferred from the previous administration building to
the new building along with fiber optics, firewalls and new printers.

Trustee Seiden noted the electrical aggregation increase was not substantial. He thinks it is
wonderful and residents are getting a break on their electric bills. Mayor Rosenthal asked how
new residents opt-in. Mr. Lichterman noted the new resident can call MC Squared or visit
northshoreelectricityaggregation.com.

PUBLIC COMMENT                               Gil Antokal, 1137 Country Lane, reminded
                                             everyone about the Deerfield Community Blood
Drive on Sunday June 2, 2013 at the Jewett Park Community Center from 8 a.m. to 1p.m. He
thanked all of the ongoing, current blood donors, those thinking about donating blood and future
blood donors.
                                           REPORTS

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION                     Mr. Street reported the Plan Commission held a

ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING                        Chief Sliozis explained that over the past several
AGREEMENTS WITH DEERFIELD                    months, police department and school district staff
SCHOOL DISTRICT 109 FOR THE                  made numerous site visits and recommendations.
REGULATION OF MOTOR VEHICLE                  The School Board agreed to allow the police
TRAFFIC AND PARKING ON SCHOOL                department to develop a site plan and regulate
PROPERTY ­ 1R                                traffic and parking on the six District #109 school
                                             properties.

This will stand as a First Reading of the Ordinance.

AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE                     Chief Sliozis noted the Board authorized the
MOBILE DATA COMPUTERS FOR                     purchase of new police vehicles at the April 15,
POLICE VEHICLES                               2013, Board of Trustees meeting. As part of the
                                              replacement, the department updates computers on
the same schedule of three ­ four years. The current computers are four years old and are
budgeted with funds from 911 revenues. The State bid is held by CDS Office Technologies.
Chief Sliozis indicated they are seeking to purchase 14 computers with five being utilized by
Bannockburn, as both communities pay into the same 911 fund. The cost of the docking stations
and antennas will be covered by each department. Chief Sliozis noted the State bid was the
lowest pricing.

Trustee Struthers noted the bulletproof and waterproof computers are very expensive. Chief
Sliozis explained they explored a less expensive version but wanted to stick with a known entity.
They hope the docking stations and antennas will be able to be reused with the new computers.

Trustee Struthers moved to authorize the purchase of mobile data computers for police vehicles
from CDS Office Technologies in an amount not to exceed $62,468. Trustee Benton seconded
the motion. The motion passed by the following vote:

                                   RECOMMENDATION

TO: Mayor and Board of Trustees

FROM: Plan Commission

DATE: May 9, 2013

RE: Request for an amendment to the Special Use/Planned Unit Development and to
amend Ordinance O-06-56 for Congregation B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim (BJBE) to correct
a discrepancy in the number of students allowed in the 1141 classroom building; to allow an
additional 225 religious school students, on Sundays only, to be accommodated throughout
the entire BJBE facility; and to install a building connection between the 1141 and 1181
buildings.

We transmit for your consideration a recommendation adopted by the Plan Commission of
the Village of Deerfield on the request of the petitioners for a amendment to the Special
Use/Planned Unit Development and to amend Ordinance O-06-56 for Congregation B'nai
Jehoshua Beth Elohim (BJBE) to correct a discrepancy in the number of students allowed in
the 1141 classroom building; to allow an additional 225 religious school students, on
Sundays only, to be accommodated throughout the entire BJBE facility, and install a
building connection. The Plan Commission held a public hearing on May 9, 2013. At that
public hearing, the petitioners presented testimony and documentary evidence in support of
the request. A copy of the public hearing and workshop minutes are attached.

In support of its request, the Plan Commission makes the following findings of fact and
conclusions:

                                 FINDINGS OF FACT

Subject Property

The subject property consists of the Deerfield Business Center, which is a 10.5 acre
development. Originally approved in 1983 as a Planned Unit Development (Ordinance O-
83-12), the property contained six (6) single-story office buildings at 1101, 1121, 1141,
1161, 1181, and 1201 Lake Cook Road. Each office building was 20,957 square feet in
area for a total of 125,742 square feet in six office buildings.

In 2006, Congregation B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim (BJBE) received approval for an
amendment to a Special Use/Planned Unit Development for the Deerfield Business Center,
a Text Amendment, and a Special Use with a parking variation to allow a religious institution
at 1141, 1181 and 1201 Lake Cook Road. The 1181 and 1201 buildings have been
renovated for BJBE, and the petitioners plan to convert the 1141 building to the previously
approved classroom space at this time.
In 2004, the Village granted approval of the Chicagoland Jewish High School and in 2005
the Village granted approval for the Greek elementary and middle school on the parcels
immediately to the east of the subject property.

West: I-1 Office, Research, and Restricted Industrial District ­ Textura

Proposed Plan

Correct Discrepancy in 2006 Special Use Approval

The petitioners are requesting approval to amend their Special Use/Planned Unit
Development approval for the property and to amend Ordinance O-06-56 dated December
19, 2006, which approved the Special Use/Planned Unit Development. Specifically, the
petitioners are requesting to correct a discrepancy in Ordinance O-06-56 regarding the
number of students permitted in the classrooms in the 1141 Lake Cook Road building. In
2006, the petitioner's floor plan and project summary indicated a maximum of 475 students,
but their written response to the Special Use standards indicated a maximum capacity of
380 students. Ordinance O-06-56 was written to allow 380 students, but the floor plan
attached as an exhibit to the ordinance shows 475 students and their written project
description shows 475 students. Attached are these 2006 documents. The petitioners
would like to amend Ordinance O-06-56 to correct a discrepancy to allow a maximum of 475
students in the 1141 building classrooms instead of 380 students. The petitioner's current
floor plan for the 1141 classroom building would accommodate up to 475 students, as
originally contemplated in 2006.

Special Use Amendment to Allow 225 Additional Religious School Students in the
BJBE Facility on Sundays

BJBE would also like approval to allow an additional 225 religious school students, on
Sundays only, to be accommodated throughout the entire BJBE facility. The current Special
Use ordinance limits the number of students in the facility in the 1141 Lake Cook Road
building as indicated above. The petitioners are requesting to amend the Special Use for the
property to reflect the requested changes to allow 225 religious school students on Sundays
only.

The petitioners plan also plan to install the link (connection) between buildings 1141 and
1181, which was approved in 2006. The petitioners have indicated the building link will be
consistent with the approved 2006 building elevation plans, except the door to the west will
be eliminated (the door to the east will remain). Attached are the 2006 building elevation
plans showing the proposed link. Other than installing the previously approved building link,

                                              2
the petitioners are not proposing any changes to the site plan, landscape plan, building
elevations or lighting plan.

Access

No changes to the site access are proposed. Access to and from the Deerfield Business
Center PUD is from the signalized intersection at Lake Cook Road and Pine Street.

BJBE uses the existing Deerfield Business Center driveways for access and all BJBE traffic
circulates around the synagogue in a one-way clockwise direction. BJBE has a dedicated
drop-off in front of the 1181 Lake Cook Road building, which is the main entrance to the
synagogue.

Traffic and Parking Study

The petitioners retained Gewalt Hamilton Associates to conduct a traffic and parking study.
The study indicates that peak times for BJBE's Sunday operations would be the drop -off
time period from 9 am to 10 am, and the pick-up time period from 11 am to noon (page 2).
Gewalt Hamilton observed traffic at BJBE's site and at Caruso School, where BJBE's
religious school currently takes place. The traffic consultant believes that the proposed 700
students on Sundays can be accommodated on the BJBE site. The additional students on
BJBE's site on Sundays would result in an additional 450 trips during each of the peak
periods (page 3). The petitioner's traffic consultant provided a detailed explanation of how
the drop-off and pick-up work at the public hearing; pages 2 and 3 of the public hearing
minutes explain how the traffic flows and how the drop-off works. The traffic consultant also
examined the available parking and found that for the most part, the additional parking
demand can be accommodated on BJBE's site. The 10 am peak hour will exceed current
BJBE parking capacity (see Exhibit 10), but BJBE has permission to use 40 parking spaces
in the Deerfield Business Center on Sundays and these additional 40 spaces would
accommodate that extra parking demand (page 5).

Zoning Conformance

The subject parcel is part of an existing PUD which is known as the Deerfield Business
Center. PUDs are a Special Use in the I-1, Office, Research, and Restricted Industrial
District. The petitioners are seeking an amendment to their Special Use/Planned Unit
Development approval for the property and to amend Ordinance O-06-56 dated December
19, 2006, which approved the Special Use/Planned Unit Development to allow 380 students
in the 1141 building classrooms. The petitioners are seeking to change the number to 475
students as explained earlier in this memo. The petitioners are also seeking approval to
allow an additional 225 religious school students, on Sundays only, to be accommodated
throughout the entire BJBE facility. The total number of students to be accommodated in
the religious school on a Sunday will not be 700 (475 in the 1141 building and 225
throughout the BJBE facility = 700 students).




                                              3
Parking

Below is how the parking for BJBE and the office buildings were calculated in 2006.

BJBE:

Required: The Zoning Ordinance requires one (1) parking space for each four (4) seats for a
place of worship. A child care facility requires one (1) parking space for each teacher and
employee, plus one (1) parking space for each ten (10) students.
The total seating capacity of the sanctuary is 600 persons (422 in the main seating area and
178 in the balcony) and the seating capacity of the chapel is 100, for a total seating capacity
of 700 persons (600 in the sanctuary and 100 in the chapel = 700) which would require 175
spaces. The petitioner's materials indicate the early childhood center will serve
approximately 35 children from six months to four years of age and there would be 15
teachers/staff. The 35 children would require 3.5 parking spaces (35/10 = 3.5) plus 15 for
the teachers/staff for a total of 18.5 spaces. BJBE would require 194 parking spaces (175
for the place of worship plus 18.5 for the childcare for a total of 193.5 = 194 spaces).

Provided: A total of 160 spaces are provided for BJBE. A variation was granted in 2006 for
the number of parking spaces as 194 are required on site, and 160 are provided on the
BJBE property, a shortage of 34 parking spaces.

BJBE and the owner of Deerfield Business Center (3 remaining office building in this
development) have a parking agreement which was a requirement of the 2006 Special Use
approval. This parking agreement will allow for use of the Deerfield Business Center
parking lots for 40 cars during non-business hours, and on weekends from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00
p.m. BJBE's parking agreement with the Deerfield Business Center to use 40 spaces in
their parking lot results in a total of 200 spaces for BJBE (160 on site and 40 off-site at the
adjacent office buildings in this PUD).

Office Buildings:

Spaces required for the remaining three (3) office building in this PUD (1101, 1121, or 1161
Lake Cook Road) on the site: The three (3) buildings are each 20,957 according to the site
plan approved in 1983 and would require 252 parking spaces (62,871 / 250 = 251.48 =
252).

Provided: There are 275 spaces provided for the three remaining office buildings at the
north end of the site.

Deerfield Business Center PUD:

Required parking spaces for both uses (BJBE and the three office buildings) in this PUD:
446 spaces (194 for proposed BJBE, plus 252 for the three remaining office buildings).




                                               4
Parking spaces provided for both uses in this PUD: A total of 435 spaces are provided on
the entire site (160 spaces on the BJBE portion of the property, and 275 spaces on the
office portion of the property).

                                      CONCLUSIONS

Correct Discrepancy in 2006 Special Use Approval

The Plan Commission is in favor of correcting the discrepancy in the number of students
allowed in the religious school that exists in the 2006 approval as described above.

Special Use Amendment to Allow 225 Additional Religious School Students in the
BJBE Facility on Sundays

Compatible with Existing Development

The Plan Commission believes that the proposed expansion of the religious school to add
225 students throughout the BJBE facility on Sundays only is planned so that it will be
compatible with existing development in the area and will not impede the normal and orderly
development and improvement of surrounding properties. The Plan Commission believes
that the proposed religious school will have minimal impact on surrounding properties. The
Plan Commission believes the religious school is a good use of the property and will be an
asset to the Village. There is a need for the proposed expanded religious school in the
community and the religious school use is well planned.

Lot of Sufficient Size

The Plan Commission believes the lot is of sufficient size for the proposed religious school.
The petitioners are not proposing to expand the size of the buildings on this campus. The
only exterior change will be the installing a link between two buildings that was previously
approved in 2006. The Plan Commission believes the property is suitable for the proposed
expanded religious school use on Sundays, and will not create a negative impact on
surrounding properties.

Traffic

The Plan Commission believes that the proposed Sunday religious school will not have an
adverse impact on the surrounding properties. They do not believe that the proposed
religious school should significantly increase traffic volumes in the area. The property
should not have any problem accommodating the traffic generated by the religious school.
The drop-off and pick-up will continue to function on the east side of the BJBE facility. The
Plan Commission believes the traffic flow (the one way operation continues) will work well.
BJBE has a good working relationship with Chicagoland Jewish High School. The Plan
Commission recommends that BJBE continue to work with the Chicagoland Jewish High
School on traffic matters should there be any issues that arise with traffic flow and parking
on the site as a result of the Sunday school religious classes. The Plan Commission
believes it would be very beneficial to BJBE to continue working with CJHS to have the gate

                                              5
between their properties opened on Sundays to allow parents to exit the site and return
directly to the traffic light at Lake Cook Road and Pine Street.

Parking and Access

The Plan Commission believes that the parking will work for the Sunday religious Sunday
school. There are currently 160 parking spaces on the BJBE property and Also, BJBE can
utilize 40 more parking spaces on the Deerfield Business Center property during non-
business hours and the weekends from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. The existing vehicular access
points into the BJBE facility parking lot will not be changed as a result of the Sunday
religious school. The existing vehicular access points on this property and the drop-off area
will not be changed as a result of the additional 225 religious school on Sundays.

Effect on the Neighborhood

The Plan Commission believes that the expansion of the religious school on Sundays to
include 225 religious school students will not be significantly or materially detrimental to the
health, safety and welfare of the public or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood, nor will it diminish or impair property values in the surrounding areas. The
Plan Commission believes that the proposed additional 225 religious school student on
Sundays will not have an adverse impact on surrounding properties and is an appropriate
location for this activity. The Plan Commission believes this expanded religious school will
work well on the property.

Adequate Facilities

Adequate facilities are already being provided for this site.

Adequate Buffering

The Plan Commission believes that the existing buffering is adequate.

                                    RECOMMENDATION

Accordingly, it is the recommendation of the Plan Commission that Congregation B'nai
Jehoshua Beth Elohim (BJBE) request for an amendment to the Special Use/Planned Unit
Development and to amend Ordinance O-06-56 to correct a discrepancy in the number of
students allowed in the 1141 classroom building; to allow an additional 225 religious school
students, on Sundays only, to be accommodated throughout the entire BJBE facility; and to
install a building connection between the 1141 and 1181 buildings, be approved.

Public Comment on a Non-Agenda Item

There was no public comment from the audience.

Public Hearing on the request for an amendment to the Special Use/Planned Unit
Development and to amend Ordinance O-06-56 for Congregation B'nai Jehoshua Beth
Elohim (BJBE) to correct a discrepancy in the number of students allowed in the 1141
classroom building; to allow an additional 225 religious school students, on Sundays
only, to be accommodated throughout the entire BJBE facility; and to add a connection
between 1141 and 1181 buildings.

Staff confirmed that notice was published in the Deerfield Review on April 18, 2013 and
the petitioner submitted proof of notification.

Lawrence Freedman, Attorney with Ash, Anos, Freedman & Logan, LLC representing
BJBE, explained the petitioners are requesting to amend the Special Use Planned Unit
Development approved in 2006. The three changes that the petitioner is seeking and/or
clarifying are:
    1. A discrepancy in the original ordinance in reference to the number of students
        allowed in the 1141 Lake Cook Road building. The testimony to the Plan
        Commission at that time, and in an exhibit, referred to 475 students. The body of
        the ordinance refers to 380 students. The petitioner would like to clarify that the
        ordinance should state 475 students.
    2. The petitioner requests to allow an additional 225 religious school students on
        Sundays only. These students will be dispersed throughout the entire facility
        whereas previously Sunday school students were limited only in the 1141 Lake
        Cook Road building.
Public Hearing: BJBE
May 9, 2013
Page 2

   3. There is a door shown in the original approved plans in the ordinance linking the
      1141 and 1181 Lake Cook Road buildings. The petitioner would like to eliminate
      the door to the west.

Mr. Freedman summarized the points in a letter from BJBE Director of Education Sandy
Robins that was submitted to the Plan Commission. This letter outlined the Sunday
usage and gives the Plan Commission a basis for which to evaluate the operation.
          The onsite weekday program will remain unchanged except for moving the
             students into new classrooms in the 1141 Lake Cook Road building.
          The Sunday morning religious school of approximately 700 students is
             currently being serviced at 1141 Lake Cook Road and Caruso Middle
             School. This plan will eliminate the Caruso Middle School operation and
             consolidate all programming at the BJBE site.
          On Sundays, BJBE does not have and is not planning to have preschool
             or prayer services on site. There will be some adult education programs
             on Sundays servicing between 35-65 people and occasional special
             events which may necessitate modifying a particular program so it is
             compatible.
          Most of the students are carpooled and dropped-off/picked-up. Most
             parents do not stay for most of the programs. Drop-offs all occur at
             approximately 9:30am and pick-ups begin to occur around noon.

In another letter from the Chicagoland Jewish High School submitted to the Plan
Commission, Mr. Freedman noted that they are currently in discussions with the
adjacent High School property to provide access through their parking lot. This will
allow for ease of access and some additional (when/if needed) parking in an overflow
situation. The petitioner will continue to provide traffic personnel during the drop-off and
pick-up periods and other activities on Sundays.

Bob Hamilton, P.E., Traffic Consultant, Gewalt Hamilton Associates, Inc., reviewed and
summarized the parking and traffic study that was done for this project. Mr. Hamilton
noted that this was an unusual study being that it was for Sunday mornings and typically
the on-street traffic is very low. Due to the location of this facility, roadway
configuration, and the adjacent properties, the only people impacted in any substantial
way by the traffic activity are the people doing the traffic activity. There are no
residential neighbors in close proximity, virtually no one in the nearby office building.
The adjacent High School and Greek school to the northeast have limited activities on
Sundays. The goal in this area is to make the traffic activity efficient. The fact that this
is a very cohesive volunteer group, traffic issues of this type tend to be self-regulating
and traffic monitors can have a tremendous impact.

Traffic circulation during arrival and departure is like many grade schools in that the
students are not the ones driving; instead it is their parents, older siblings,
grandparents, etc. In this case, Mr. Hamilton noted that the traffic is a consistent
system and he does not see a problem with it. Traffic will increase substantially due to
Public Hearing: BJBE

the students at Caruso coming to this location. The traffic study was done in the spring
and was based on a per student basis as if all 700 students were in attendance every
week. Mr. Hamilton reviewed the traffic circulation on the site plan noting that inbound
traffic enters from the south leg of Pine Street from a dedicated right-turn bay into the
BJBE site and proceeds across the front (east side) of the BJBE building. Currently, all
drop-off operations are very efficient and occur at the east door. The traffic study
suggests that the petitioner work with the High School to open up their gate on Sunday
mornings. This option increases efficiency and imposes no burden on the High School.

The study also looked at the direction from which vehicles enter and exit. Mr. Hamilton
noted that they anticipated and over allocated vehicles coming to and from the west,
partly because they don't know the volume of parents that pick-up and deliver to both
the 1141 building and Caruso school. The arrival period or peak period will be
approximately 20-25 minutes, and that will work well. Mr. Hamilton noted that the
bigger issue is the departure period from the school. The current plan is to have the
students leave through the east entrance in a one or two lane approach when there is a
traffic monitor. The alternative is to have dismissal at the opposite door having the
younger children dismissed at one door and older students at another door. For
security reasons, there is a substantial number of parents that park and walk-in to pick-
up their children. This is particularly true for kindergarten through third grades. The
study recommends that this indoor pick-up process does not change. Mr. Hamilton said
that the possibility of opening up access through the High School for vehicles to exit
would be a nice alternative. He also finds that traffic assistance or monitors are
effective and recommend that they continue to be used.

Mr. Hamilton noted that they studied parking at the site and at Caruso and prorated it in
the study on a per student basis. Parking demand is driven by teachers and staff and
with the exception of the peak hours all parking demands can be handled within the
BJBE parking lot. The 1-hour peak period overflow can be accommodated in the
overflow parking lot to the north of the site. If there is an agreement with the High
School, overflow can be accommodated at High School. Overall, there is adequate
parking on the site and available on site. Commissioner Berg asked if the remainder of
the Deerfield Business Center parking lot to the north is restricted to other tenants. Mr.
Freedman stated that there is a covenant that allows BJBE to utilize 40 parking spaces
in the Deerfield Business Center parking lot. This parking is off-site and is in addition to
the BJBE on-site parking. Mr. Freedman clarified that an agreement with the adjacent
High School for additional parking is in addition to the BJBE parking and the off-site
parking. Mr. Freedman noted that an agreement with the High School would be
overflow parking if necessary. Commissioner Shayman asked if there is only one
session of classes that occur on Sundays. Mr. Freedman stated that there is only one
drop-off and one pick-up time. Mr. Hamilton added that if BJBE finds that it is getting
too tight the drop-off can be off-set and staggered since peak period occurs within a 30
minute period. Dismissal is already slightly staggered as it exists. Mr. Freedman also
noted that the petitioner is well prepared to adjust programming if accommodations
need to be made in the event that parking gets to tight. Chairman Shapiro asked the
Public Hearing: BJBE

petitioner why they think they need the High School parking. Mr. Freedman does not
think that they need the High School parking and with the additional 40 off-site parking
spaces the petitioner is well within their margin of error to meet their parking needs.
Chairman Shapiro asked Mr. Hamilton that if the High School parking was not included,
would it have any influence to his testimony especially if the petitioner had a big event.
Mr. Hamilton said no, but it would depend on the size of the big event. He stated that
the traffic and parking study estimated that all 700 students would be in attendance, and
the parking lot can handle the demand. Chairman Shapiro asked if the current parking
could accommodate a High Holiday. Mr. Freedman noted that the parking requirement
for BJBE was based upon the capacity of the sanctuary. Mr. Freedman noted that if
there were a need for parking during High Holidays, there is already an understanding
in place with the High School that the High School would accommodate overflow
parking.

Commissioner Bromberg wanted clarification on the location of the gate operated by the
High School and when it would be open. Mr. Freedman noted that the benefit of
keeping the gate open for their operations would be for easier access and circulation.
Mr. Hamilton noted that keeping the gate open allows for a more direct access to the
traffic signal. Commissioner Bromberg asked if there was a stacking issue. Mr.
Freeman stated that there no stacking issues. He also noted that since 2006, the High
School and BJBE have co-existed in a very friendly way and there have been many
accommodations and he doesn't anticipate an issue going forward. Mr. Freedman
commented that this also holds true for the Greek School.

Commissioner Bromberg asked if current enrollment was 700 students and if there are
plans for growing the program. Mr. Freedman stated that taking into account the 1141
building and Caruso, the current enrollment is 700 students. Sandy Robbins, Director
Education, BJBE, commented that they will certainly welcome new members and
depending on what is approved they will do whatever they need to do to make the work
within their maximum student numbers whether it means using shifts or staggering
classes. Mr. Freedman clarified they are still limited by the seating capacity so if BJBE
is fortunate to grow, the maximum number of students at any given time would still be
700.

Commissioner Berg asked if the traffic circulation flow in the plan was the same as the
current traffic flow for the site. Mr. Hamilton noted that the only change would be the
crossover through the High School. Under the current traffic flow pattern,
Commissioner Berg asked if there were any stacking problems on the Frontage Road
waiting for the traffic signal on Lake Cook Road. Mr. Hamilton commented that a big
percentage of vehicles go to the west on the Frontage Road, probably to avoid that
situation, and he didn't believe there was a stacking issue on the Frontage Road. Mr.
Hamilton stated that the biggest constraint was the signal time.

Mr. Freedman added that he has submitted to the Plan Commission his responses to
the Special Use Standards for the ordinance and wanted to make sure that it was part
of their presentation and part of the public record.

Commissioner Bromberg asked the petitioner to point out the door in the link that will be
taken out of the plan. Roy Splansky, real estate specialist for BJBE, commented that
the original plan showed two points of egress from the building link. From a security
standpoint the petitioner decided it was best not to have access from the west side of
the link. The door on the east side of the link is for emergency access or alternatively
a point of entrance. If there was an event happening within the larger programming this
would allow children to enter directly into the school building without going through the
main entrance. The building link does not exist currently and the west door would be
eliminated from the plan.

Commissioner Berg motioned to close the Public Hearing and Commissioner Moyer
seconded the motion.

Respectfully submitted,

The Plan Commission of the Village of Deerfield held a Workshop Meeting at 7:30 P.M. on May
9, 2013 at the Village Hall, 850 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, Illinois.

Chairman Shapiro called the meeting to order.

Present were: Dan Shapiro, Chairman
                    Larry Berg
                    Alan Bromberg
                    Jim Moyer
                    Stuart Shayman

Absent:               Elaine Jacoby

Also present:         Jeff Ryckaert, Principal Planner
                      Kathleen LéVeque, Associate Planner

Discussion of recommendation for Congregation BJBE

Chairman Shapiro asked the petitioner what would the expected timeline be for an agreement
with the High School. Mr. Freedman would guess 60 days. He noted that they have been
talking to the High School and if something can be formulated it will be done in the near future.
Chairman Shapiro asked the petitioner if there would be any objection if any approvals from the
Plan Commission or the Village Board were contingent on that approval for access from the
High School. Chairman Shapiro is concerned about access. Mr. Freedman did not favor this
because the petitioner feels that the High School approval is not needed for parking or for
access. Approval from the High School enhances the plan but is not needed for the plan to go
succeed. Commissioner Shayman does not think the access through the High School is a
major part of the traffic study. Chairman Shapiro believes approval from the High School would
be helpful. Chairman Shapiro agrees with Mr. Freedman but would like to see petitioner pledge
to use their best efforts to get the approval. Mr. Freedman stated that they will use their best
efforts because it would make the plan work better.

Commissioner Berg motioned to approve the request for an amendment to the Special
Use/Planned Unit Development and to amend Ordinance O-06-56 for Congregation B'nai
Jehoshua Beth Elohim (BJBE) to correct a discrepancy in the number of students allowed in the
1141 classroom building; to allow an additional 225 religious school students, on Sundays only,
to be accommodated throughout the entire BJBE facility; and to add a building connection
between 1141 and 1181 buildings.

Commissioner Bromberg seconded the motion.

The vote was as follows:
Ayes (5): Berg, Bromberg, Moyer, Shayman, Shapiro
Nays (0): None

This recommendation will go before the Village Board on Monday, June 3, 2013.

                             13.11-D SPECIAL USE: STANDARDS



A.     Compatible with Existing Development.

        The nature and intensity of the activities involved and the size, placement and design of any
structures proposed will be so planned that the Special Use will be compatible with the existing
development and will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of
surrounding property.

         Congregation B 'N ai . Jehoshua Beth Elohim ("BJBE") proposes to develop a religious
institution on a site of approximately 4.3 acres located at the property commonly known as 1141,
1181, and 1201 Lake Cook Road, south of the intersection of Lake Cook Road and Pine Street in
the Village ofDeer:field. The synagogue and related activities will include four (4) pre-kindergarten
classrooms in Phase I of the development, and an additional nineteen (19) after-school!Sunday
school classrooms in Phase II. The site development will be constructed in two (2) phases, with the
first stage to include the conversion of the buildings located at 1181 and 1201 Lake Cook Road into
a sanctuary, social hall, general offices, multi-purpose rooms and a kitchen. The second phase of
development will entail the conversion of the building located at 1141 Lake Cook Road into
nineteen (19) after-school!Si:mday school classrooms. The second phase is contemplated to take
place in 2009. The total building area after completion ofboth phases will be 71,380 square feet.
The sanctuary will seat up to 601 people and the chapel will seat up to 110 people. After
completion of Phase I, the school will have a maximum capacity of 80 pre-school students who will
utilize the facilities on weekday mornings, with teachers/staff support of 15. After completion of
Phase II, there will be a maximum capacity of 380 students after school on weekdays and during
Sunday school, with teachers/staff of 50. The property is part of a twelve (12) acre Planned Unit
Development ("PUD"), which is currently zoned I-1 Office, Research, Restricted Industrial District.
Accordingly, BJBE seeks an amendment to the PUD to provide for a special use permit for a
religious institution and appropriate text amendments with respect thereto.

        The proposed use is compatible with the rest of the PUD and particularly with the adjacent
portions thereof. To the east is the 4.97 acre Hellenic American Academy of Chicagoland and the 7
acre Chicagoland Jewish High School site, construction of which was recently commenced. To the
north is an office complex. The only residential property within the general area of the PUD is
located north of Lake Cook Road which provides a natural barrier to the PUD. There is no other
underdeveloped or undeveloped property in the immediate area which will be effected by the
proposed religious institution. The surrounding uses are not only compatible with the proposed use,
but the owners of such surrounding uses have agreed to mutually cooperate in providing use of
parking to accommodate peak periods occasioned by holidays and other particular needs occasioned
by the unique demands of any of the particular facilities. The synergies of the neighboring facilities
promote not only inter-cultural relationships, but an efficient use of neighboring properties.

Project Summary                                                                                           Sept. 12, 2006

The concept presented in these drawings is for the adaptive use of the three buildings 1141, 1181, and 1201 at the
Deerfield Business Center off Lake Cook Road for the B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim (BJBE) synagogue. This scheme is
the result of a master planning process with the building committee at BJBE and Finegold Alexander+ Associates Inc.
(FA+A), and we are pleased to present this to the Village of Deerfield planning commission for review and comment.

The design reflects the goals and programming needs for BJBE, and marries the qualitative and quantitative vision for the
project to transform the existing one-story office buildings to create a place of worship, assembly and education for the
synagogue. The specifics of the plans include:

    ·   Building 1181 will be renovated and expanded to accommodate a new double-height sanctuary with balconies to
        accommodate up to 600 people. The sanctuary will have a clerestory roof "lifting" to the east to admit natural light
        into the worship space.
    ·   Building 1181 will contain the Village C.enter with a new roof monitor added on top to admit natural light into the
        space. The Village court enhances opportunities for community gathering and meeting, and serves also as a pre-
        function reception area. In addition, program functions related to a central administration office core, chapel,
        library, multi-purpose rooms, bride's room, gift shop, and support spaces for toilets, coatroom, and storage are
        proposed.               '
    ·   The Village Center would open up to the existing landscape courtyard, as a central gathering and orienting space:
        in effect, an "Indoor/Outdoor Village Center".
    ·   Building 1201 will be renovated to include a new high ceiling multi-use social/cultural space large enough to
        accommodate up to 900 people on High Holy Days or 400 in banquet style seating. In addition, this building will
        also include a kitchen, storage, multipurpose rooms, and Pre-K Classroom wing. The Pre-K Classroom wing
        consists of 4 classrooms, and will accommodate up to 80 kids. These classrooms will connect directly to an
        outdoor playground space that can accommodate up to 50 kids at one time.
    ·   Building 1141 will be renovated for the Religious Day School. It consists of 19 classrooms and support spaces,
        and will accommodate up to 475 students. By locating the classrooms in this wing, it allows the school to have it's
        own identity, while connected to the rest of the synagogue through a new school entry and galleria link added to
        the east side of building 1181.
    ·   The three existing buildings of 63,282 GSF + 8.098 GSF new construction = 71,380 GSF Total.

The landscape and site plan are also proposed with modifications, which include:

    ·   A new entry Galleria link and drop-off is proposed in front of building 1181, which creates a main arrival entry
        point for BJBE. This drop-off will provide handicap parking spaces adjacent to main entry plaza.
    ·   New landscape design is proposed at the front of building 1181, with a proposed walled-in sacred garden
        surrounding the sanctuary. Existing landscaping will be preserved and enhanced where required around new
        entries and egress points.
    ·   The playground will be fenced in for control and security, outside the Pre-K classroom wing.
    ·   A new auto entry point is proposed between the New Jewish High School and our site to the northeast.
    ·   The existing 220 on-site parking spaces will reduce to 163 in the new master plan layout.
    ·   The site is 4.33 acres or 188,615 GSF, resulting in a 0.40 FAR ratio.

The proposed materials cladding the exterior renovations and additions will complement the existing one-story office
buildings, which largely consist of concrete aggregate panels and aluminum storefront windows. The Sanctuary is
proposed to be clad in precast concrete panels with a lead-coated copper roof with clerestory windows. The Social Hall is
proposed with lead coated copper panels, with larger storefront windows in metal frames at the base. The mechanical
screens, which will conceal the larger rooftop unit!:? adjacent to the sanctuary and social hall, will be metal. Finally the new
entry/galleria link is proposed as a precast concrete frame, extending full height and length along the east side of building
1181, joining to the school wing in building 1141 to create a gracious entry link and portal for the temple.

This design concept preserves what is best about the existing context, while building for the future of BJBE.

                                                        Our File No. 13-50

     Dear Jeff:

             Please be advised that I represent Congregation B'Nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim, the owner
     of the property which is the subject of the captioned special use.

             The Congregation is requesting that the Village clarify a discrepancy which we recently
     noticed in the captioned Ordinance. Section 4C provides that the 1141 Lake Cook building as
     renovated would have a maximum total capacity of380 students. This appears to be the result of
     a clerical error and is in fact contrary to an exhibit attached to the Ordinance in the form of a
     Project Summary prepared by the project architect, Finegold Alexander+ Associates, Inc., dated
     September 12, 2006, which specifically provides that the renovated facility at 1141 Lake Cook
     Road would accommodate up to 475 students. Testimony given before the Plan Commission at
     the time ofthe approval of the special use was consistent with the 475 maximum capacity rather
     than the 380. Accordingly we are asking that Section 4C be clarified to reflect a maximum
     enrollment of 475 students.

              In addition, the Congregation is seeking an Amendment to the Special Use/PUD to allow
     up to an additional 225 students, on Sundays only, to be accommodated throughout the entire
     facility and not just limited to the building at 1141 Lake Cook Road. The Congregation is also
     requesting that the Final Development Plan attached to the Ordinance as Exhibit "B" be amended
     to reflect the minor modifications to the proposed plan of development which are set forth in the
     modified plan which we are delivering directly to you by separate transmission.

       If the enclosed is acceptable, kindly schedule a Public Hearing before the Plan
Commission, and provide us with a copy of the Notice of Public Hearing so that we may mail
such notices to those required to be notified by Village ordinances. I enclose herewith for your
reference a copy of the proposed notification list which I have prepared based upon current
Assessor's records.

       If you have any questions, please call me. Thank you.

                                            Very truly yours,

President                     Dear Jeff and Kathy:
 David Wax z'l
Acting President              In preparation for the upcoming zoning modification for BJBE's school program,
 Terri Argentar               the following shall summarize the current status and future plans of the school and
Executive Vice President      temple programming upon completion of our religious campus.
 Bonnie Utch
Vice Presidents               Our weekday program is currently held onsite at BJBE and will remain unchanged
 Andrew Bloom                 other than moving the program into our new classrooms. This program includes
  Brett Salzer
  Gary Schaffel
                              our Hebrew education classes held on both Tuesdays and Thursdays.
  Lisa Wilson                 BJBE's Sunday morning religious school is approximately 700 students and is
 Recording Secretary
 Susie Selbst
                              currently held both at the temple and Caruso Middle School (roughly 75% of the
Immediate Past President      program is at Caruso). BJBE began offsite education at Caruso in 2005 prior to our
  Patti Frazin                move to Deerfield. This off-site location allowed BJBE to grow an educational
Sisterhood Co-Presidents      program for Jewish families in the community and also facilitated our planned
 Jennifer Cramer
 Susan Jones                  phasing into our temple campus. Unfortunately, it also created logistical issues by
Men's Club President          having a split program and keeping our children away from their spiritual home.
 Jack Goldberg                We are excited to "Bring our Children Home" which has been part of our
S.Y.G. Co-Presidents
 Lauren Schlessinger
                              fundraising theme.
 Sara Splansky                As planned, the renovation will split the school building between traditional
 Past Presidents
 Arnold Preis*                classrooms and five "Core Value Centers" for special projects and interactive
 Robert Tauber*               experiences. These "centers" are based on BJBE's core values of Torah, Music &
 Leon Rabin*
 Bertram Sinker*
                              Prayer, Giving, Israel, and Community. While the curriculum is still in the planning
 Gerald Hibnick*              stages, the intent is to have two-thirds of the students in the new education
 Marvin Glanzrock             building with the remaining students in our existing building utilizing our sacred
 Albert Wagner*
 Zelda Wise                   space, preschool rooms and multipurpose space.
 Marshall D. Krolick
 James L. Harfield            On Sundays, BJBE does not have the weekday preschool program in operation
 Gerald Loebman               nor do we hold prayer services. Oftentimes there is adult educational programming
 Sandra Leon
 Stanley Swig*                that occurs on our campus ranging between 35 and 65 attendees. In addition,
 Joseph Ernsteen              there are special events or religious holidays which may occur on Sundays,
 D. Milton Salzer
 Sandee Holleb
                              however the school program would be modified accordingly.

As is the current situation at Caruso, the vast majority of parents have carpools
arranged and drop off their students without entering the building at 9:30 am and pick
them up at noon, again without entering the building. To help facilitate egress for drop
off and pick up (if necessary), we are in discussions with the Chicagoland Jewish High
School to utilize a portion of their parking lot for additional parking as well as the
school road for exiting to Lake Cook Road. In those

discussions, there will be a contingency plan for those times when CJHS has larger
Sunday morning programming. BJBE will make alternative arrangements to either
have off-site programming for some classes (museum tours, cemetery visits) or will
schedule split drop off/pick up times.
The current Caruso site has many more challenges for traffic management in that it is
within a residential neighborhood and has only one point of ingress and egress. Traffic
from either direction must be stopped to allow the other to cross over. We do not have
this issue at our building. The office building is generally not in use and the high school
is not in session. BJBE currently utilizes traffic personnel at Caruso to facilitate the
traffic flow and will continue to do so at the temple on Sundays.
Our traffic personnel will help direct traffic such that a portion of the cars will circulate
and exit through Deerfield Business Center (DBC) and a portion will exit through
CJHS. BJBE's site has 150 parking spaces with an additional 40 spaces within the
office building per the Declaration between BJBE and DBC.
We are very excited to complete the BJBE learning center and have a thriving
Jewish educational and spiritual experience for a few hours on Sunday
mornings within our 70,000 square foot campus at 1201 Lake Cook Road. We will
continue to work with the community and our neighbors as we have done since
making Deerfield our home in 2009.
Thank you for your assistance in the zoning modification process.
Sincerely,

 ~'\2h~.-.,

                       SPECIAL USE CRITERIA FOR REQUESTED
                            AMENDMENT TO 0-06-56 BJBE


1. Compatible with Existing Development
   The nature and intensity of the activities involved and the size, placement and design of any
   structures proposed will be so planned that the Special Use will be compatible with the
   existing development and will not impede the normal and orderly development and
   improvement of surrounding property.

           The requested amendment to allow an additional 225 religious school students on
           Sundays only will be compatible with the existing development and will not impede
           normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property in that
           there are no proposed changes in the approved site plan, landscape plan, building
           elevations, or lighting plan, and as concluded by Petitioner's traffic consultant:

               (a) The adjacent roadways can accommodate the additional anticipated Sunday
                   school traffic by continuing and supplementing a number of the traffic
                   operations that were recommended when the site was originally improved;
                   and

               (b) The projected parking demand can be accommodated on-site along with the
                   additional office park spaces which are provided by covenant.

2. Lot of Sufficient Size
   The size of the lot will be sufficient for the use proposed.

           Inasmuch as both access and parking can be accommodated, as indicated by
           Petitioner's traffic consultant, the size of the lot will be sufficient for the proposed
           use.

3. Traffic
   The location of the Special Use within the Village will be such that adverse effects on
   surrounding properties will be minimal, particularly regarding the traffic generated by the
   Special Use.

           As concluded by Petitioner's traffic consultant, the adjacent roadways can
           accommodate additional anticipated Sunday school traffic by continuing and
           supplementing a number of the traffic operations that were recommended when the
           site was originally approved, such that there will be no adverse effects on surrounding
           properties, particularly regarding the traffic generated by the Special Use as amended.

4. Parking and Access
   Parking areas will be of adequate size for the particular use and properly located, and the
   entrance and exit drives will be laid out so as to prevent traffic hazards and nuisances.
           As concluded by Petitioner's traffic consultant, the entrance and exit drives as
           currently constructed are laid out as to prevent traffic hazards and nuisances
           notwithstanding the proposed increase in an additional 225 religious school students
           on Sundays only. It is further concluded by Petitioner's traffic consultant that parking
           areas will be of adequate size for the Special Use as proposed to be amended
           inasmuch as the projected parking demands can be accommodated by on-site parking
           along with additional office park spaces provided by covenant.

5. Effect on Neighborhood
   In all respects the Special Use will not be significantly or materially detrimental to the health,
   safety and welfare of the public or injurious to the other property or improvements in the
   neighborhood, nor will it diminish or impair property values in the surrounding area.

           The Special Use has been in operation since its approval in 2006, and has operated
           with no deleterious effect on the neighborhood or surrounding area. Based upon
           Petitioner's traffic consultant's conclusions that both access and parking demand will
           not be negatively impacted by the proposed modification to the Special Use, the
           Special Use, as amended, will not significantly or materially be detrimental to the
           health, safety, and welfare of the public or injurious to other property or
           improvements in the neighborhood, nor will it diminish or impair property values in
           the surrounding area.

6. Adequate Facilities
   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary facilities have been or
   are being provided.

           The proposed increase in Sunday school students will have no impact whatsoever on
           existing utilities, drainage, or other facilities. As concluded by Petitioner's traffic
           consultant, existing access roads can accommodate the additional anticipated traffic
           by continuing and supplementing a number of the traffic operations which were
           recommended when the site was originally approved. Accordingly, adequate utilities,
           access roads, drainage and/or other necessary facilities have been or are being
           provided.

7. Adequate Buffering
   Adequate fencing and/or screening shall be provided to ensure the enjoyment of surrounding
   properties, to provide for the public safety or to screen parking areas and other visually
   incompatible uses.

           The proposed amendment to the Special Use does not require any changes to the
           buffering which was approved and provided pursuant to the original Special Use,
           such that adequate fencing and/or screening is provided to insure enjoyment of
           surrounding properties and to provide for public safety and to screen parking areas
           and other visually and incompatible uses without any modifications thereto.

Amendment to Special Use for the BJBE property
Village of Deerfield


To Whom It May Concern:
Ms. Sandy Robbins of B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim has (BJBE) has asked me to write a letter of
recommendation for the temple and it is with pleasure that I do so.
Ms. Robbins and the temple have rented significant amounts of space from Deerfield Public Schools District
109 since 2006 for religious education classes for both weekday evenings and their Sunday morning program
(the last few years their use was Sunday mornings only). She, her teachers and students have been excellent
partners in using this community space while public school is out of session. They treat our classrooms and
teachers' belongings respectfully. BJBE always had traffic management personnel in place and we did not have
any issues with traffic flow within the site or with the surrounding neighborhood.
I understand that the Deerfield Plan Commission and Village Board are meeting to discuss an Amendment to
Special Use for the BJBE property and I hope you will consider this letter in your considerations.
Sincerely,




Greg Himebaugh
Assistant Superintendent of Finance & Operations

Dear Jeff: 
 
On behalf of Deerfield Office Center LLC, I have reviewed the materials submitted by Congregation B'nai  
Jehoshua Beth Elohim,  "BJBE" related to their request to amend the zoning to increase the number of 
students to 700 on Sundays only.  I have also reviewed the Traffic Planning Study completed by Gewalt 
Hamilton Associates dated May 8, 2013. 
 
Since the completion of BJBE's first phase BJBE administrative staff and personnel have consistently 
managed the traffic and parking needs in accordance with the Deerfield Business Centers Declaration of 
Covenants, Easements and Restrictions.   This includes the hiring of extra traffic personnel for special 
events such as holidays and funerals.  If past practices are any indication of the future I am confident 
BJBE will effectively manage the parking and passage of vehicles with the increased number of students 
on Sundays. 
 
Provided BJBE follows the recommendations outlined in the report prepared by Gewalt Hamilton 
Associates regarding the management of additional traffic and parking Deerfield Business Center 
supports the proposed change in the permitted number of students on Sundays. 
 
Congregation B'nai  Jehoshua Beth Elohim has been a wonderful neighbor since the opening of their 
facility and on behalf of the owners of Deerfield Business Center we are delighted to see the completion 
of their facility in the near future.

             Proposed Education Program Consolidation
             Deerfield, Illinois

                SECTION 1 PROJECT CONTEXT AND SUMMARY STATEMENT

GEWALT HAMILTON ASSOCIATES, INC. (GHA) has investigated the traffic planning and parking
requirements of the above referenced project. Congregation B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim (BJBE)
proposes to expand its current on-site Sunday School program by bringing those students currently
utilizing space at Caruso Middle School back to the site.

Our study findings are discussed below and various recommendations are offered for your consideration.
Exhibits referenced in the text are centrally located in the Technical Addendum at the end of this report.

Briefly summarizing, we believe that the adjacent roadways can accommodate the additional anticipated
Sunday School traffic by continuing and supplementing a number of the Traffic Operations that were
recommended when the Temple site was originally approved. Furthermore, projected parking demands
can be accommodated by BJBE's on-site and agreed to shared parking supply. Key elements to
successfully managing the additional traffic and parking include:

      Continued coordination with adjacent religious schools (Hellenic American Academy and the
      Chicagoland Jewish High School) to minimize overlap of significant activities and special events.
      Peak Traffic for Sunday School occurs when the majority of the adjacent office space is at minimal
      operations.
      Continue to seek agreements to accommodate additional on and off site overflow parking.
      Maintain current one-way flow around BJBE site and seek use of CJHS connection and driveway to
      separate exiting traffic.
      Sunday School and primary worship services are not concurrent.

                          SECTION 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Exhibits 1 and 2 ­ Site Location Map and Site Context

Exhibit 1 identifies the location of Congregation B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim (BJBE), which is
comprised of three buildings in the Deerfield Business Center (1141, 1181, and 1201 Lake Cook Road)
and utilizes the 1201 Lake Cook Road address. The Deerfield Business Center is made up of a total of
six buildings located on approximately 10.5-acres at the southwest corner of the Pine Street intersection
with Lake Cook Road in the Village of Deerfield, Illinois.

Approximately 100 feet south of Lake Cook Road, there is an internal intersection that serves the office
development to the west, the Hellenic American Academy located at 1085 Lake Cook Road to the east
and the south leg provides access to both Congregation BJBE and the Chicagoland Jewish High School
(CJHS). All inbound BJBE traffic accesses the site from a point approximately 350 feet south of the
frontage road intersection and circulation around the BJBE buildings is one way clockwise.

Exhibit 2 provides an aerial photo of the surrounding uses for context.

Exhibit 3 ­ Photographic Inventory

Exhibit 3 provides a photo inventory of current operations at the internal Frontage Road intersection as
well as the BJBE entrance and drop off areas.

Exhibit 4 ­ Existing Traffic Volumes

On Sunday April 21, 2013 GHA conducted peak period (7:00 am to 2:00 pm) traffic counts at the
Frontage road intersections with Pine Street, the Deerfield business Center driveways and the BJBE /
CJHS driveway split. Two resultant peak hours were observed associated with the predominant drop-off
/ pick-up movements in lieu of parents staying on-site with their children. The "inbound" peak occurred
from 9:00 to 10:00 am and the "outbound" peak hour occurred from 11:00 am to 12:00 pm. Those traffic
volumes are illustrated in Exhibit 4. While we present and discuss hourly volumes the true peaks of
these two movements are much shorter, with the inbound peak only lasting between 15-20 minutes and
the outbound peak lasting between 25-30 minutes.

Observations were also conducted by GHA at Caruso Middle School on Sunday May 5, 2013 to
quantify the impact of moving the Sunday school program from Caruso to the 1201 Lake Cook site.
Similar, shortened peak periods were observed at Caruso.

No unusual delays occurred during the counts such as foul weather (e.g. heavy snowfall or rain), road
construction, or emergency vehicle activity that would adversely affect the volumes or travel patterns.

Traffic count data summaries can be found in Appendix I.

Exhibit 5 ­ Existing Parking Occupancy

Concurrently with our Sunday traffic observations, GHA conducted hourly parking occupancy counts in
the Deerfield Business Center, the Hellenic American Academy lot and the CJHS parking lot. Exhibit 5
illustrates the parking lot designations as well as summarizes the parking occupancy by hour and the
                                                              Gewalt Hamilton Associates, Inc. ­ Page 2

                                                                                      1201 Lake Cook Road
                                                                                              Deerfield, IL
peak occupancy during our observation period. As can be seen, while HAA and CJHS had some limited
activities, the Deerfield Business Center was almost vacant and the CJHS parking demand peaked at 80
vehicles on site during the 10-11:00 am hour.

The following tabulates the supplemental parking observations at Caruso School which were conducted
on Sunday May 5, 2013.

conjunction with athletic field use resulted in offsite parking on adjacent residential streets. BJBE
demand represents typical operations of ±30 teachers and staff.

Exhibit 6 ­ Building Plan

Included as Exhibit 6 is the April 15, 2013 site plan prepared by Finegold Alexander and Associates,
Inc. (FAA) depicting the planned internal renovations to the 1141 building to accommodate the
additional students that will be relocated from Caruso School.

Exhibit 7 ­ Project Traffic Characteristics

Traffic Generations

Part A of Exhibit 7 tabulates the observed traffic volumes for the current Sunday Peak Periods at BJBE
as observed by GHA on Sunday April 21 2013 as well as the subsequent observations at Caruso School
on Sunday May 5, 2013. Traffic volumes at both locations exhibited distinct "inbound" and "outbound"
peaks which have been tabulated separately. As can be seen, the "inbound" and "outbound" peaks were
observed between 9:00 to 10:00 am and 11:00 am to 12:00 pm respectively. These periods coincide with
the beginning and ending times of the Sunday school program from 9:30 am to 12:00 pm.

The total number of inbound and outbound trips during the two peak hours was utilized to determine an
average trip rate for the total number of attendees at the two sites. We feel that this represents a
conservative approach to projecting traffic volume for a larger group because: 1) parents with children
in multiple age groups / classes would have been counted at both locations, 2) the trips at the Temple
site also include traffic activities associated with other adult oriented programs and worship that occur
concurrently with Sunday School.

Part B. of Exhibit 7 utilizes the above referenced average rate to project traffic volumes out to the
ultimate 700 student capacity of the BJBE campus on Lake Cook Road. The increased student
attendance at BJBE is expected to generate approximately 450 additional trips during each of the peak
                                                             Gewalt Hamilton Associates, Inc. ­ Page 3
                                                                                B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim
                                                                                      1201 Lake Cook Road
                                                                                              Deerfield, IL
hours. As noted above, this volume is likely overstated, but we believe that it allows us to analyze the
maximum potential impacts of the planned consolidation of the education program.

Trip Distribution

Part C of Exhibit 7 summarizes the observed directional distribution of BJBE traffic. We observed that
slightly more traffic arrived and departed to and from the west along Lake Cook Road and the frontage
road than to and from the east. After years of being prohibited, traffic is now permitted to travel north
and south across Lake Cook Road at Pine Street. Due to the current separated programs, it is possible
that the ultimate distribution could be different as parents make a single stop in Deerfield vs. potentially
two stops due to the current separation of the education program.

                                     SECTION 4 EVALUATION

Exhibits 8 & 9 ­ Sunday School Traffic Assignments

Traffic generated by the proposed consolidation of BJBE Sunday School classes was "assigned" to the
adjacent roadways based on the project characteristics (see Exhibit 7) and the site's access system and is
illustrated in Exhibit 8. BJBE traffic was then combined with the Existing Traffic volumes (see Exhibit
4) to yield the Total Traffic assignment, which is presented, in Exhibit 9.

Exhibit 10 ­ Parking Calculations

The current BJBE site provides approximately 149 parking spaces. There is an agreement with Deerfield
Business Center to utilize an additional 40 and ongoing discussions with CJHS to utilize some of their
189 spaces for overflow.

In GHA's original analyses of parking demands for BJBE, the maximum parking demand on site was
expected to occur on Friday evenings and holidays when the full congregation attends services in the
sanctuary. During the week programs were expected to have a maximum of 100 attendees. Therefore
parking demand for the original development was based on the seating capacity of the Chapel space
(approximately 711).

Using the Place of Worship calculation (1 space per 4 seats) parking demand / requirement was
established at 178 spaces (1 space / 4 seats = 711/4 = 177.75). While not met on-site it was proposed
that BJBE would work with adjacent properties to make arrangements for overflow parking when those
uses are not at peak operations.

Our observed Peak Demand for parking at BJBE on Sunday was 80 spaces. Of the various activities that
occurred at Caruso School, the typical parking demand for Sunday School is approximately 30,
primarily teachers and adult assistants for the education programs. These combined observations result
in an average parking demand of 0.23 spaces per attendee (almost exactly the same as the 1 space per 4
seats of the worship area calculations). While we are aware of no current plan to add significant staff for
the consolidation and expansion of the on-site education program, if parking demand increased at the
average rate of 0.23 spaces per attendee to 700 attendees total an additional 52 spaces would be
required.



                                                               Gewalt Hamilton Associates, Inc. ­ Page 4

                                                                                       1201 Lake Cook Road
                                                                                               Deerfield, IL
Exhibit 10 includes three separate tables which provide:

Part A ­ Observed parking demand in the study area at BJBE as well as supplemental demand of Sunday
         School programming at Caruso.

Part B ­ Projected additional demand of net increase to 700 students at 0.23 spaces per student average
         as observed.

Part C ­ Future Parking demands in Study area. As can be seen there is only one hour that parking is
         expected to exceed demand of the on-site BJBE supply of 149 spaces. However the anticipated
         demand does not exceed the additional 40 spaces available to BJBE in the Deerfield Business
         Center.

Exhibit 11 ­ Recommended Traffic Operations

Exhibit 11 notes key operational recommendations to allow the existing site and surrounding roadways
to accommodate the anticipated increases in traffic associated with consolidation of the Sunday School
program

1. Continue to seek and utilize cross parking agreements for overflow parking at peak times.
2. Utilize traffic personnel to coordinate internal intersection operations at south end of drop off lane.
3. Utilize CJHS cross access as additional site exit for drop off / pick up maneuvers during peak
   periods
4. Maintain one-way circulation pattern on site
5. Consider alternate drop-off pick up locations if necessary

While we believe our analyses has conservatively considered the maximum traffic and parking impacts
on site, should congestion and parking concerns arise, BJBE could always consider staggered class start
and end times to reduce the intensity of the short traffic peaks.

Note that all of the following recommendations from the original study have been completed:

   Extend the westbound left turn lane from its current length of 150 feet to 300 feet. [CCHD]
   Modify existing traffic signal timing and phasing at the Lake Cook / Pine Street intersection.
   [CCHD]
   Widen the south leg of the frontage road intersection to provide two northbound lanes. [CJHS]
   Coordinate with CJHS to consider a one way (right turn only) connection near the BJBE building
   entrance. [BJBE]
   Consider a second, gated connection between the BJBE and CJHS sites to allow easier cross access
   for shared parking arrangements and provide both sites with an alternate emergency access. [BJBE]

RE: Public hearing on the request to rezone the property at 780 Saunders Road from R-1
Single Family Residential District to C-2 Outlying Commercial District, for an amendment
to the Comprehensive Plan and a Special Use for a restaurant ­ Health O Wealth, Inc.

We transmit for your consideration a recommendation adopted by the Plan Commission of
the Village of Deerfield on the request of the petitioners for a rezoning of the property at
780 Saunders Road from R-1 Single Family Residential District to C-2 Outlying
Commercial District, for an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan, and a Special Use for
a restaurant. The Plan Commission held a public hearing on April 11, 2013. At that public
hearing, the petitioners presented testimony and documentary evidence in support of the
request. A copy of the public hearing and workshop minutes are attached.

In support of its request, the Plan Commission makes the following findings of fact and
conclusions:

                                  FINDINGS OF FACT

Subject Property

The subject property consists of the property at 780 Saunders Road. The property is
zoned R-1 Single Family Residential and is approximately 32,700 square feet in area (100
feet wide and 327 feet deep) and is currently developed with a single family home.

Surrounding Zoning and Land Use

North: Village of Riverwoods ­ commercial properties (bank with a drive-thru and a gas
 station with convenience store)
South: I-1 Office, Research and Restricted Industry ­ Parkway North Center
East: I-1 Office, Research and Restricted Industry ­ Parkway North Center
West (across Saunders Road): Village of Riverwoods ­ single family homes

Proposed Plan

The petitioners have purchased the property at 780 Saunders Road and propose to
redevelop it. They are seeking approval to rezone the property from R-1 Single Family
Residential to C-2 Outlying Commercial. They propose to develop the site with a single
building to be used for a restaurant and a parking area. The proposed restaurant will be
3,000 s.f. in area and will have a 2,000 s.f. outdoor deck area for dining. The restaurant
building will be located in the southwest corner of the site. Vehicular access will be from a
driveway on Saunders Road. The proposed parking area will be located on the north and
east of the restaurant and will contain 33 parking spaces in including 2 handicapped
spaces. Traffic flow will be in a counterclockwise direction through the site. There will be
no vehicular connections to the adjacent Parkway North Center property or bank property.
The petitioner's site plan shows a pedestrian path connecting to the existing Parkway
North Center walking trail to the east. The petitioners' plans show a future connecting
pathway leading to Saunders Road, subject to Lake County coordination.

The proposed restaurant will be called Health O Wealth and the restaurant will have a
mission of promoting wellness, health, and nutrition. The petitioners project their annual
sales to be between $750,000 and $1 million. The proposed restaurant will sell freshly
prepared casual meals and prepackaged foods. The petitioners have provided a sample
menu which includes items such as smoothies, wraps, paninis, salads, soups, and
espresso bar drinks. The proposed restaurant will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the
peak time being noon. The petitioners anticipate the restaurant will have 10 employees,
with a maximum of 4 to 5 employees working at one time, and will expect a maximum of
20 to 30 patrons at one time. The petitioners have indicated they anticipate the
restaurants business to be about 60% carry out and 40% dine in. The petitioner's
materials indicate they anticipate deliveries and loading to occur between 5 a.m. and 6
a.m.

The entrances to the restaurant building are located off the outdoor deck. Patrons enter
the deck area and can then access the restaurant. The floor plan shows the interior of the
restaurant containing a cash register area, a seating and retail area, an office, a storage
area, and restrooms. The floor plans for the proposed restaurant show that in the winter
the petitioners will have the tables and chairs located indoors and in the summer, a portion
of the tables and chairs will be moved outdoors. The overall seating capacity of the
restaurant will not increase with the outdoor seating area.

The proposed exterior materials for the restaurant building are shown on the petitioner's
elevation drawings. A metal screen will wrap most of the building and the outdoor deck,
and this metal screen can serve as a support for a green wall. A structural steel element
will support the metal screen. Behind the metal screen will be translucent wall panels.
The south wall of the restaurant building which separates it from the deck will be high
efficiency glazed telescoping wall panels. The metal screen will be on the north side of the
restaurant building, the south side of the deck, as well as the northern portion of the east
and west elevations. The southern portion of the east elevation will be open and a ramp
will lead to the outdoor deck. The southern portion of the west elevation will have a
screening wall made from reclaimed wood or environmentally responsibly material and a
ramp where patrons can enter. The outdoor deck and ramps will be made with reclaimed
wood or a rapidly renewable material. The outdoor deck will contain bike racks.
The petitioner's materials indicate that there are several green features for the building
including the possibility of creating a green wall on the metal screen which wraps the
building, the use of reclaimed or rapidly renewable wood and the use of some
environmentally responsible materials, use of low VOC materials inside the building, and a



                                              2
stormwater recharge basin on-site. Also, the packaging for their products will be 100%
biodegradable.

Access

Lake County has jurisdiction over Saunders Road. The Lake County Division of
Transportation has granted full access for the proposed restaurant at 780 Saunders Road.
The letter from LCDOT is included with the petitioner's materials.

Zoning Conformance

Rezoning

The subject property is currently zoned R-1 Single Family Residential. In order to allow
the proposed redevelopment of the parcel with a restaurant, the property has to be
rezoned to the appropriate zoning district which is C-2 Outlying Commercial District.
Attached are the standards for rezoning.

Special Use

The petitioners are seeking approval of a Special Use for the proposed restaurant.

Staff has inquired with the petitioners about the possibility of a condition being placed on
the property that designates the use for this property for retail or restaurant only. If the
proposed restaurant left the property, the petitioner would be required to replace the use
with another use that generated sales tax for the Village. The petitioners have indicated
that they would agree to such a restriction as a condition of approval.

Minimum Yards

Front Yard (to west)
Required: 50 feet
Proposed: 25 feet to the building (variation needed)
           18.6 feet to the outdoor dining deck (variation needed)

Rear Yard (to east)
Required: 10 feet
Proposed: 148.4 feet for the building
           140.3 feet to the outdoor dining deck

Side Yards (to north and south)
Required: 12 feet
Proposed: 42.9 feet from the building to the north property line
           6.9 feet from the building to the south property line for the outdoor deck dining
           area (variation needed)




                                              3
Maximum Building Height

The maximum building height allowed for a commercial PUD in the C-2 Outlying
Commercial District is 35 feet. Mechanical appurtenances can exceed the maximum
building height by no more than 12 feet in height. The petitioner's elevation drawings show
the highest point on the building is the metal screen, which reaches a height of 21 feet.

Screening of Mechanicals

Any rooftop mechanicals would need to be screened from view. The petitioners have
indicated to staff that no rooftop mechanicals are proposed at this time, and no ground
level HVAC units are proposed.

Maximum Lot Coverage

Allowed: The maximum lot coverage is 30% of the lot.
Proposed: 18.06% lot coverage.

Required Parking

Based on the anticipated 40 percent dine-in and 60 percent carry-out, a total of 35 parking
spaces are required for the restaurant, and a total of 69 parking spaces are required when
the proposed outdoor dining area is included in the parking calculation (dine-in: 3,000 s.f. x
.40 = 1,200 / 60 = 20; plus carry-out: 3,000 s.f. x .60 = 1,800 / 120 = 15; plus outdoor
dining: 2,000 s.f. / 60 = 33.3 = 34; 20 + 15 + 34 = 69 parking spaces).
The site plan shows there are 33 parking spaces provided including 2 handicapped
spaces. Variation needed for parking spaces.

The Zoning Ordinance indicates that outdoor seating is counted toward required parking
unless the Village believes the outdoor seating area will not have an adverse impact on
parking, and then the area of the outdoor seating area would not be counted in the
required number of parking spaces for the restaurant. The petitioners have indicated that
they believe that when the weather is nice, the outdoor dining area will attract patrons who
would otherwise dine inside. They do not believe the outdoor dining area will generate
additional parking demand. If outdoor dining is added to the required parking, 34 more
spaces would be need to be added (2,000 / 60 s.f. for a sit-down restaurant = 33.3 = 34
spaces). The parking requirements for a restaurant can be increased or decreased up to
25 percent by the Board of Trustees upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission.

The petitioners have hired TADI to conduct a traffic and parking study. The petitioner's
consultant conducted traffic counts on Saunders Road and determined that the peak times
are weekday mornings from 7:45 to 8:45 a.m. and weekday evenings from 4:30 to 5:30
p.m. The morning traffic consists of 73% of vehicles traveling southbound, and the
evening traffic consists of 75% of vehicles traveling northbound. Exhibit 2 in the traffic
study shows existing traffic counts at the peak times. The study references the ITE
manual to determine trip generation for the proposed restaurant. Table 2 shows the



                                              4
anticipated site-generated traffic projections for the restaurant. It is anticipated that during
the morning peak hour there will be 20 trips in and 15 trips out, for a total of 35 trips.
During the evening peak hour it is anticipated that there will be a 20 trips in and 10 trips
out, for a total of 30 trips. Daily the restaurant is anticipated to have a total of 380 trips.
The petitioners expect the restaurant to be operational by the year 2014 and have
predicted the traffic impacts for the year 2019. They have applied a 3% annual growth to
existing traffic volumes according Lake County DOT guidelines. Exhibit 2 shows the
predicted traffic counts for the year 2019, including the traffic generated by the restaurant.
The petitioners have conducted a level of service delay analysis at the intersection of the
Saunders Road and the restaurant's driveway. The Lake County DOT has granted full
access for the proposed restaurant driveway. The proposed restaurant is not anticipated
to cause significant delays on Saunders Road, but delays are expected for customers
making left turns out of the restaurant. The petitioners anticipate that typically only one
vehicle will be queued to exit the restaurant site. The petitioners believe that access to the
site will be adequate to serve the restaurant.

TADI examined the proposed on-site parking and circulation. Vehicles will navigate
counterclockwise through the site. The two easternmost parallel parking spaces have
been removed in order to accommodate turning vehicles circulating the site. TADI
recommends that 3 or 4 parallel parking stalls be designated and signed for employee
parking.

Screening of Parking Lots

Required: Permanent peripheral screening at least five (5) feet high shall be constructed in
side and rear yards adjacent to parking areas. This screening may consist of a planted
earth berm, densely planted evergreen shrubs or trees, or a combination of both. In side
and rear yards, the screening shall be so located and constructed as to not interfere or
conflict with the use of any utility easements or utility installations existing or planned to be
installed in these easement areas.

Proposed: The petitioner's site plan shows plantings along the north and south (side) yards
and the east (rear) yard to screen the parking area. The site plan indicates that the
plantings are five feet high as required and that they will consist of densely planted
evergreen shrubs or trees.

Location of Parking Spaces

Required: Parking spaces must be located at least 5 feet from the property line in
commercial districts.

Proposed: The site plan shows the following dimensions for the parking lot to the lot line:
 North: 5 feet from the property line
 South: 10.2 feet from the property line
 East: 6 feet from the property line
 West: approximately 18 feet from the property line



                                                5
Size of Parking Spaces

90 degree parking spaces:
Required: 9 feet by 19 feet
Proposed: 9 feet by 19 feet

Parallel parking spaces:
Required: 8.5 feet by 23 feet
Proposed: 8.5 feet by 23 feet

Drive Aisle Widths

Aisle widths for 90 degree parking spaces:
Required: 24 feet
Proposed: 24 feet

Aisle widths for parallel parking spaces:
Required: 24 feet for two-way aisles; 12 feet for one-way aisles
Proposed: 24.5 feet for the two-way aisle; 12.5 feet for the one-way aisle

Loading

Required: The proposed restaurant building is below the square footage threshold where
the Zoning Ordinance has specifications for required loading areas. According to Article
8.03-G of the Zoning Ordinance, where buildings are less than the minimum square
footage required for off-street loading facilities, such facilities shall be provided with
adequate receiving facilities with vehicular access to the property.

Proposed: A specific loading area is not shown on the site plan. The petitioners have
indicated that the loading will occur between 5 and 6 a.m., before the restaurant is open to
customers, so they do not anticipate conflicts between the loading and customer traffic.
The TADI traffic and parking study also examined loading and includes a turning analysis
for 30 foot truck. The petitioner's consultant recommends that all loading, delivery and
refuse collection occur during non-business hours.

Stormwater Detention and Utilities

The petitioners have been working with the Village Engineers regarding stormwater, water
service, and sanitary sewer service. The property is under the threshold for size and
impervious coverage where the petitioners would have to provide stormwater detention on
site. The petitioners have elected to provide stormwater recharge basins with natural
plantings located at the southeast corner of the site, as shown on the site plan. This will
allow stormwater to filter back into the ground. The roof drains discharge into the south
side yard swale in order to allow for the stormwater to infiltrate and recharge into the
ground.




                                             6
The adjacent Parkway North property is served by Village water. The petitioner's Site
Utilities Plan indicates there are two options for water service connection, which will be
determined based on conversations with Parkway North Center. One option is to connect
to a water main located in Deerfield Road right-of-way, about 200 feet north of the subject
property. The other option is to connect to a water main located about 150 feet southeast
of the subject property.

The property will need a sanitary sewer connection, which is shown on the plan as coming
off Deerfield Road. In this area of the Village, sanitary sewer connections are provided
through Lake County's special service area #5 (SSA #5). The petitioners are working with
Lake County to connect to SSA #5.

Bike Racks

The Zoning Ordinance requires that where appropriate, all developments in the
commercial districts have to provide for bicycle storage, and safe and smooth internal
circulation. The petitioners' plans show that bike racks will be provided on the deck area.

In 2010, Deerfield Road was designated a regional bike corridor by the Northwest
Municipal Conference. In the last couple years, an underpass was created for bikes and
pedestrians to cross under the Tollway ramp on the north side of Deerfield Road, and
further west on Deerfield Road a new bike path and bridge over the Des Plaines River
were created by Lake County. Deerfield Road is also part of Deerfield's bike route in the
Village's Comprehensive Plan (see attached Deerfield Bike Route Map from the
Comprehensive Plan).

Trash/Refuse Area

Required: The petitioners are required to screen the trash/refuse area.
Proposed: A composting area will be provided east of the restaurant building. The
petitioner's plans indicate the composting area will be screened. The trash and recycling
area will be located inside the building, and which can be accessed from doors on the
north side of the building. The recycling and composting is part of the restaurant's
reduced/zero waste approach and provide an educational opportunity for customers and
employees.

Landscaping

The petitioner's plans show the proposed landscaping along the western property line in
front of the building and near the ground sign. Landscaping is also shown along the south
and north property lines.

   21.5 s.f.

Location:

   Permitted: Ground signs may be located in a required front, side or year yard but shall
   not extend over any lot line.

   Proposed: The petitioner's plans show the ground sign is located in the front yard and
   that it is not extending over the lot line.

Comprehensive Plan

The Village's future land use map in the Comprehensive Plan (an advisory document that
guides growth in the Village) indicates that this property should be office/research use. In
order to allow commercial development, the Comprehensive Plan would have to be
amended to allow commercial development on this parcel. Attached is the Future Land
Use from the Comprehensive Plan.

Appearance Review Commission (ARC)

If the property is rezoned to the C-2 Outlying Commercial District, the petitioners will have
to seek ARC approval of the proposed building, landscaping, and signage.

Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA)

As this is a non-PUD property, any variations must be considered by the Board of Zoning
Appeals (BZA). The petitioners held a public hearing with the BZA on May 7, 2013.

                                     CONCLUSIONS

Request for a map amendment to rezone the subject property from R-1 Single
Family Residence to C-2 Outlying Commercial District.

The Plan Commission has reviewed the criteria for a rezoning and believes that the
petitioners have presented evidence to warrant a rezoning of the subject property. The
Plan Commission believes that a rezoning is appropriate given the existing surrounding
uses in the area. Properties to the north of the subject property are developed commercial
uses in the Village of Riverwoods. The Plan Commission believes the proposed rezoning
would permit a well planned development that will be compatible with the surrounding
properties. The Plan Commission believes the proposed restaurant will coexist well with
the other land uses in the area. The subject property is currently zoned R-1 Single Family
District. The Plan Commission believes the requested rezoning of the property from R-1
Single Family District to C-2 Outlying Commercial will be a suitable zoning district for the
proposed use. The property is being rezoned to the appropriate district for a restaurant.
The Plan Commission believes the rezoning of this property will permit a well planned
development in a suitable zoning classification. The Plan Commission believes that the
subject property is unsuitable and inappropriate for a single family home. The Plan
Commission believes the trend of development in the general area has been commercial
and not residential. Sales and property tax revenue to the Village would be greater if the
property was to be developed commercially.

Amendment to Comprehensive Plan

The Plan Commission believes the requested amendment to the Comprehensive Plan is
appropriate and they are in favor of the change. They believe the proposed commercial
use is an appropriate use of this property and believe the petitioners have submitted a
well-planned commercial use for this property.

Special Use for Proposed Restaurant:

Compatible with Existing Development

The Plan Commission believes that the proposed restaurant will be compatible with
existing development and should not impede the orderly development and improvement of
surrounding properties. They believe the proposed restaurant is a good and appropriate
use of the property and will be compatible with the existing development in the area. The
property to the north is a commercial area, and property to the south and east is office.
The property is adjacent to a busy four lane road. The Plan Commission believes the use
will not have an adverse impact on the area. The property was previously used as a single
family residence which the Plan Commission believes is not an appropriate use for this
parcel which is an isolated residential use.




                                            10
Lot of Sufficient Size

The Plan Commission believes the subject property is of sufficient size for the proposed
restaurant use. The Plan Commission believes that the property is suitable for the
proposed use and will not create a negative impact on surrounding properties. They
believe the proposed commercial use of the property is appropriate and the proposed
restaurant is well planned.

Traffic

The Plan Commission believes that the proposed use should not create traffic problems on
the subject property and should not have an adverse impact on surrounding properties.
The Plan Commission heard testimony from the petitioner's traffic consultant and they
believe the proposed use should not significantly increase traffic volumes in the area.
Saunders Road already carries a significant amount of traffic, and the additional traffic
generated by the restaurant would have minimal impact on the area. A large percentage
of the business will be from drivers already passing by on the roadway. The Plan
Commission believes that the proposed restaurant will have minimal traffic impact on the
surrounding properties. They believe the traffic generated by the proposed restaurant will
not have an adverse impact on the area. The Plan Commission also believes the traffic
will flow well on the site.

Parking and Access

The Plan Commission believes that parking will be adequate for the proposed restaurant.
They believe the proposed restaurant should not create a parking problem in the area.
They are a couple spaces short of the requirement, but the Plan Commission believes
there will be plenty of spaces for the day to day operations of the restaurant. The
petitioners have indicated that restaurant employees can park at the nearby Mobile gas
station. The Plan Commission does not believe there is a need to count the outdoor dining
area in the required parking count. The petitioners have indicated that when the outdoor
dining area is open, tables and chairs from inside the restaurant will be moved outside, so
there will not be an increase in the seating capacity of the restaurant. The seating capacity
for the restaurant is 60 people. The carry-out customers will be in and out of the restaurant
in a short amount of time creating a quick turn over in the parking lot.

The Plan Commission believes that the means of ingress and egress can safely handle the
traffic generated by the proposed restaurant. The Plan Commission believes that the full
access point on Saunders Road will be able to safely handle the traffic generated by the
development. The petitioners have been working with the Lake Cook Highway
Department (which has jurisdiction over Saunders Road) and they have granted the
restaurant parcel full access to Saunders Road. The Plan Commission is pleased there will
be a pedestrian connection to the Parkway North Center development allowing office users
easy access to the restaurant.




                                             11
Effect on Neighborhood

The Plan Commission believes the proposed restaurant should not be significantly or
materially detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of the public or injurious to the other
property or improvements in the neighborhood nor should it diminish or impair property
values in the surrounding area. The restaurant parcel is connected by a sidewalk to the
Parkway North Center allowing the office development patrons easy walking access to the
restaurant. The Plan Commission believes the proposed use will not have an adverse
impact on surrounding properties. The Plan Commission the proposed use should not be
problem for the neighboring properties and that it will not be intrusive on the residential
properties across the street. The Plan Commission believes that the proposed restaurant
will be a good use and will be an asset to the Village. The restaurant use will generate
sales tax for the Village. The petitioners have indicated that if the restaurant should leave
the property at some point in the future, they are agreeable to restricting future uses on the
property to uses that generate sales tax.

Adequate Facilities

Adequate facilities (utilities, access roads, drainage facilities) will be provided on the
subject property for the restaurant.

Adequate Buffering

The Plan Commission believes that the proposed buffering on the subject property is
adequate. They petitioners have created a new landscape plan for the subject property
that contains a variety of plantings and landscaping screening will be provided around the
perimeter of the parking lot.

                                    RECOMMENDATION

Accordingly, it is the recommendation of the Plan Commission the petitioner's request to
rezone the property at 780 Saunders Road from R-1 Single Family Residential District to
C-2 Outlying Commercial District, for an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan, and a
Special Use for a restaurant (Health O Wealth, Inc.) with outdoor seating, as submitted,
with the condition that there be a use restriction on the property limited to a retail or
restaurant, be approved.

                               VILLAGE OF DEERFIELD

The Plan Commission of the Village of Deerfield held a Public Hearing at 7:30 P.M. on
April 11, 2013 at the Village Hall, 850 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, Illinois.

Chairman Shapiro called the meeting to order.

Present were:       Dan Shapiro, Chairman
                    Larry Berg
                    Alan Bromberg
                    Jim Moyer

Absent:             Elaine Jacoby

Also present:       Jeff Ryckaert, Principal Planner
                    Kathleen LéVeque, Associate Planner

Public Comment on a Non-Agenda Item

There was no public comment from the audience.

Chairman Shapiro congratulated Commissioner Rob Nadler for recently being elected to
the Village of Deerfield Board of Trustees and acknowledged that this will be
Commissioner Nadler's last meeting on the Plan Commission. Chairman Shapiro
commented that Commissioner Nadler has done a great job and will be greatly missed.

In the spirit of full disclosure, Commissioner Berg made public that he has been
engaged with some outside work with a relative of the petitioner but doesn't believe that
it creates any conflict of interest whatsoever. Commissioner Berg stated that if there
are no objections he will remain for the public hearing. Chairman Shapiro and the
Commissioners had no objection. There was no objection from anyone in the
attendance.

Public Hearing on the request to rezone the property at 780 Saunders Road from R-1

and the petitioner submitted proof of notification.
Public Hearing

Brett Webster, Project Manager with Shive-Hattery, introduced Anil and Upasana
Abbott, owners of 780 Saunders Road as well as civil engineer, Jason Doland of Doland
Engineering, Dave McCallum, Landscape Architect, McCallum Associates and Peter
Lemon, Traffic Engineer, TADI Traffic Engineers.

Mr. Webster addressed the minor changes to the site plan since the last workshop
meeting. The changes included the elimination of 2 parallel parking stalls on the
northeast corner of the site to allow for more space for the counterclockwise turning
movement at this corner of the parking lot. Another change was moving the trash
enclosure to the inside of the building. Mr. Webster commented that the petitioner is
striving to have a zero waste facility but it is not a perfect science so the little trash that
may result and all of the recyclable materials will be in this trash enclosure. This is not
a traditional trash enclosure and likewise there will not be a loading area for the
enclosure. Mr. Webster does not envision a full-size refuse truck to service this site
because of the minimal trash volume that will be generated. He displayed a truck
circulation movement on the site based on a 30' truck. A 30' truck would be able to
move throughout the site but would have to make a 3-point turn maneuver at the east
end of the site. Mr. Webster noted that it would be unusual for a truck this size or larger
to have to come onto this site but if they need to be on the site it would be arranged to
be there after normal work hours.

Mr. Webster noted that they have begun to investigate the building and site signage. A
wall sign will be on the building's west elevation. The ground sign that is being
requested is also at the west elevation.

Upasana Abbott, owner of 780 Saunders Road, restated the mission of their company is
to inspire wellness and healthy living and to promote health through balanced nutrition
in order to live fulfilling lives. Mrs. Abbott is a food scientist and has been in this
profession for 30 years. She is very passionate about their business and will bring
knowledge and expertise in healthy and fresh foods. The concept of this restaurant is to
serve healthy and fresh food to live a healthy lifestyle. The building will be eco-friendly
and they will strive to be a zero-waste facility. Mr. Anil Abbott has 30 years of
experience in the food and retail business with the goal of providing excellent customer
service. Mr. Abbott owns the adjacent Exxon Mobile gas station franchise at the
southeast corner of Saunders and Deerfield Road. The Abbott's are concerned with
being a good neighbor to residents and businesses in the community.

In response to the petitioner's request for an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan,
Mr. Webster noted significant changes have taken place since the subject property was
placed in the present R-1 Single Family Residential zoning classification. The
properties to the north, south and east have moved away from residential uses and are
more aligned with the nature of this proposed business. The Village of Deerfield will
also gain the sales tax benefit from the redevelopment of this property as a restaurant
as allowed in the C-2 Outlying Commercial zoning district.
Public Hearing
April 11, 2013
Page 3

In response to the rezoning standards, Mr. Webster reiterated that there are commercial
and office uses to the north, south and east parcels of the subject property. There is
residential development to the west of the subject property across Saunders Road. The
subject property's R-1 Single Family Residential zoning is not suitable to the proposed
restaurant use. The petitioner is requesting the zoning be amended to the C-2 Outlying
Commercial District zoning classification to provide suitability for the proposed
restaurant use.

The future trend of the properties to the east of Saunders Road is office and research
as identified in the Village of Deerfield's Future Land Use Map from the Comprehensive
Plan. Mr. Webster commented that the size of this parcel does not lend itself to office
uses. To the north and outside of the Village boundaries, the trend is commercial
development. Mr. Webster noted significant changes that have taken place since this
property was placed in the R-1 Single Family Residential zoning district and have
evolved of the commercial nature. It is the petitioner's contention that a small restaurant
use is suited for the rezoning of this parcel.

Mr. Webster addressed the Special Use Criteria:

Compatible with Existing Development

The petitioner is proposing a single-story, low-rise restaurant with landscaping
surrounding the building. The building position will connect to existing pedestrian and
bike pathways and is a compatible way to develop this parcel.

Lot of Sufficient Size

The size of the lot will be sufficient to the building that is proposed. The lot adequately
accommodates the parking required for a proposed restaurant anticipated to have 60%
carry-out customers and 40% dine-in customers.

Traffic

The location of the Special Use within the Village will be such that adverse effects on
surrounding properties will be minimal, particularly by the traffic generated from the
Special Use. As stated in the traffic study, the proposed seating capacity of the
restaurant is 60 seats and one of the lightest volume capacities that are addressed by
traffic standards. The petitioners believe that there will be no impact on traffic
generated from this business.

Parking and Access

The petitioner's feel that they have designed a safe and compact parking lot which can
handle the capacity and types of movements for its patrons and their employees. Mr.
Webster commented that even in spite of their adequate parking needs, the petitioner
Public Hearing
April 11, 2013
Page 4

plans to have their employees parking on their adjacent commercial property on the
corner of Saunders and Deerfield Roads. The full-access drive on Saunders Road is a
safe driveway. There will be some delays for left turn movements out of the driveway
but not of significant concern. The petitioner believes that parking and access meets
the Special Use standards.

Effect on the Neighborhood

In all respects, the petitioner believes that this restaurant use is not be significantly or
materially detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the public or injurious to the
other property or improvements in the neighborhood nor diminish property values in the
area. The petitioner hopes that this development can be seen as an improvement to
the immediate neighborhood.

Adequate Facilities

Preliminary engineering has been reviewed and coordinated with the Village Engineers
to ensure that adequate facilities are being provided to this property and for the
intended building use.

Adequate Buffering

The site and landscaping plan are showing that they are complying with all of the
Village's standards to ensure adequate buffering.

Village Center District

This standard does not apply as this parcel is outside of the Village Center District.

Peter Lemon, Traffic Consultant, TADI, noted that the scope of their study focused on
two main areas; the access driveway and a site plan review from a transportation
standpoint.

Traffic counts were taken at the site along Saunders Road. Peak periods were 7:00AM-
9:00AM and 4:00PM ­ 6:00PM. Based on the size of the restaurant traffic generation
projections were formed. Chairman Shapiro asked if the size of the restaurant was
based on the square footage or the seating capacity and if so, was there a difference.
Mr. Lemon confirmed that it was based on the square footage but generally there is not
a difference between the square footage and the seating capacity. Mr. Lemon noted
that more studies have been done on square footage and therefore that measurement
provides a larger sample size.

Traffic generation projections were taken from the Institute of Traffic Engineers Manual.
This size of restaurant generates 35 trips per hour during the morning peak period. The
trips were broken down by 25 inbound trips and 10 outbound trips. The afternoon peak
Public Hearing
April 11, 2013
Page 5

period would generate 30 trips per hours, with 20 inbound and 10 outbound trips. The
outbound trips were divided evenly with 5 vehicles going south onto Saunders Road
and 5 vehicles going north on Saunders Road.

By overlaying the site generated traffic at the driveway with the traffic counts going north
and south on Saunders Road. Mr. Lemon studied capacity analysis to see the delay for
inbound traffic, specifically the critical movements which were the southbound left turns
into the site and the outbound left turn out of the site. Operation is characterized
according to the amount of control delay at each approach and quantified into a level of
service (LOS). The LOS quantifies and categorizes a driver's ease of movement and
delays as a result of intersection control and resulting traffic queuing. Based on this
data, LOS was good with a LOS of A & B during the morning peak periods. A LOS E
was found for outbound traffic turning left onto Saunders Road during the afternoon
peak period. Mr. Lemon commented that this diminished LOS is just beyond the LOS
threshold of what is typically expected. This LOS is not uncommon for the minor leg
approach with an arterial roadway, such as Saunders Road. This traffic movement will
have to rely on gaps in traffic flow created by adjacent signalized intersections along
Saunders Road at Deerfield Road and Parkway North. The 10 outbound vehicles
generated during this peak period would be divided evenly with 5 vehicles going south
(making a left turn) and 5 vehicles going north (making a right turn) on Saunders Road.
This will not impact a large number of vehicles and the delays that the motorists will
experience will happen on the restaurant site. Mr. Lemon reiterated that their study is
based on Lake County granting full access at the driveway. This was confirmed with
Lake County Traffic Engineers.

The second component of this study was traffic circulation on the site. Circulation on
the site will be in a counterclockwise movement. Mr. Lemon commented that turning
movements for passenger vehicles at the northeast corner was tight and recommended
the elimination of the 2 eastern most parallel parking stalls. The petitioner incorporated
the removal these stalls in their site plan. The circulation study took a conservative
approach to loading and delivery vehicles by using a 30' truck to circulate through the
site. The circulation path illustrated some overlap with parking spaces so the petitioner
will have to work with the vendors to make sure these delivery vehicles access the
property outside of normal work hours so as to not conflict with parked vehicles.

Another recommendation by the traffic study was to designate employee only parking at
the western end of the site to keep the most convenient spaces for patrons. Mr. Lemon
commented that the petitioner has mentioned that there is an opportunity for employees
to park offsite on their adjacent property to the north. Offsite employee parking will
create more opportunity for visitors to park.

Based on the site plan review, their recommendations have been incorporated into the
site plan and Mr. Lemon is comfortable with the circulation options on the site. The
outbound left turn traffic delay is minor and will have little impact on traffic due to
Public Hearing
April 11, 2013
Page 6

queuing taking place on site and the low traffic generation for this type of restaurant
use.

Commissioner Nadler noted that outbound left turners will have to cross two lanes of
traffic going north and asked the maximum number of employees on site at any time.
Mr. Abbott stated that during peak periods there will be three employees. They plan to
have employees park at their adjacent Exxon Mobile gas station.

Chairman Shapiro asked how the Fire and Police Departments have reacted to the site
plan. Mr. Webster referenced a letter submitted from the Fire Department. The Fire
Department reviewed the site plan and their only concern is an ambulance circulating
through the site. Mr. Webster noted that a 22' ambulance would have trouble
negotiating the turn at the northeast corner of the site if a vehicle was parked in that
corner. The ambulance would have to back up once to get through this turn. The Fire
Marshal did not have a problem with this issue and submitted a letter of approval stating
that based on the revised site plan dated 3/30/13 , they did not foresee any issues for
access to this site for emergency vehicles.

Commissioner Berg asked the petitioner if Saunders Road was 4 or 5 lanes wide at the
proposed driveway entry. Mr. Lemon commented that there are 4 lanes plus the
tapering of the left turn lane to Deerfield Road. Mr. Lemon also commented that
southbound traffic on Saunders is heavier in the morning peak period and heavier
northbound in the afternoon peak period. Mr. Lemon noted that the volumes are such
that less than half of the peak traffic is northbound in the morning and less than half of
the peak traffic is southbound in the afternoon peak period. Mr. Lemon expects that this
is due to Tollway access.

Commissioner Moyer asked if there will be adequate directional signage on site. Mr.
Webster commented that they intend to paint directional arrows into the pavement as
well as a one-way directional sign in curbed, landscaped parking island. There is also
an opportunity to put up "do not enter" signs to direct the counterclockwise circulation.
Commissioner Moyer thought that having painted arrows in the pavement is nice feature
but will not work during snow fall. Commissioner Moyer asked if there were concerns
regarding a fire truck accessing the site. Mr. Webster stated that the Fire Department
did not mention any concerns with a fire truck on the site. Mr. Webster did not speak to
the Fire Department directly on this subject but noted that there is a fire hydrant north of
the parcel and another to the south. The Fire Department was satisfied with the
proximity of the hydrants. Commissioner Moyer is concerned with a fire truck accessing
the site as well as vehicles turning left and going southbound during peak hours. Mr.
Lemon acknowledged that there will be some challenges turning left during peak
periods but the adjacent traffic signals will provide traffic gaps and the low number of
vehicles projected to make this movement (5) is low. The traffic study also expects no
more than 2 vehicles queuing, on site, at a time during these delays. Commissioner
Shayman asked Mr. Lemon is he had an idea of how much time would pass between
gaps. Mr. Lemon mentioned that the traffic signals cycling is approximately a minute in
Public Hearing
April 11, 2013
Page 7

each direction. The average delay time that they witnessed during their traffic counts
was 43 seconds with most of the delay due to exiting vehicle turning left onto Saunders
Road.

Commissioner Moyer asked Mr. Ryckaert if it was possible to restrict left turns out of the
site at certain times. Mr. Ryckaert noted that Saunders Road is under the jurisdiction of
Lake County Highway Department and they have granted full-access. Mr. Lemon noted
that Lake County did their own analysis of the traffic conditions before they granted full
access.

Commissioner Nadler asked the petitioner if they were aware the Village could place a
restriction on the property that would allow only commercial or retail use on this parcel.
Mr. and Mrs. Abbott were aware of the restriction and did not have an issue with the
zoning restriction. Chairman Shapiro clarified that if this proposal were to be
recommended to the Board there would be an ordinance that would restrict this parcel
to remain as a sales tax generating property. The ordinance would be recorded against
the property and the restriction would stay with the property. Mr. & Mrs. Abbott
understand this aspect and did not have an issue with the restriction.

Jason Doland, civil engineer, Doland Engineering, noted that the challenge from a site
civil standpoint is threefold; getting water into the site, removing waste off the site, and
dealing with stormwater in a way that will not adversely affect the neighboring parcels.

Mr. Doland noted that they have two options for obtaining water; one option is
approximately 200' north and another 150' southeast of the site. Both water mains are
on Parkway North Center property and they have verbal agreements for accessing
these water mains. Sanitary sewer is readily accessible in the right-of-way adjacent to
the site.

Mr. Doland is very conscious of stormwater management. While there is a storm sewer
on the adjacent Parkway North property that receives stormwater runoff from this
property, they will promote the infiltration of ground water recharge with basins on site
as opposed to letting water flow slowly from the property. Mr. Doland noted that there
are recharge basins to the east and south of the property that will not only stop the
storm water but also take out pollutants before they get down stream.

From a site civil standpoint these challenges have been addressed and they are ready
to take these issues to final design. Commissioner Shayman asked if this was reviewed
by Village Engineers. Mr. Doland stated that this plan has been shared with Village
Engineers and they were comfortable with the plan.

Dave McCallum, landscape architect, McCallum Associates, described a landscape
plan that meets the intent and requirements of Village Code as well as provides an
attractive setting for the restaurant and the streetscape. The landscape plan will have 5'
high evergreens adjacent to the parking lot to the north and south intermixed with
Public Hearing
April 11, 2013
Page 8

native, 4" caliper shade trees. The native shades tree will be of a mixed variety.
Adjacent to the outdoor patio/deck will be a combination of native grasses and shrubs.
The southeast corner (stormwater recharge area) will be treated like a bio-swale rain
garden with a variety of different sedges and perennials that will take the stormwater
and cleanse it before it continues on its way. The front of the building will be a
combination of shade trees, ornamental ground cover, evergreen shrubs and perennial
flowers. The right of way will be landscaped with sod.

Mr. Webster displayed and presented the site lighting. The LED light fixture is 3' in
length and a foot wide and provides control of the projected light. One of the light pole
fixtures will have a shield preventing light from being projected toward the back of the
fixture and Saunders Road. The other two light pole fixtures will be in the landscaped
parking islands. The three parking lot light poles meet Village requirements for
illuminating this type of parking lot. Any lighting needed for pedestrians will be on the
building. The site lighting plan will have a zero foot-candle level around the periphery of
the site as required by Village site lighting ordinance. Commissioner Shayman asked
how the building itself and the signage will be illuminated. Mr. Webster commented that
the signage is internally illuminated. The wall sign on the west elevation will be
internally illuminated and controlled to be turned off at the end of the business day as
required by Village ordinance. The building itself is a combination of glass walls and a
screen and will have some illumination when lights are on inside the building. The
interior building illumination will be diminished due to the nature of the building
materials. There will be lighting on the deck which will be suspended from the roof
structure. Due to the horizontal covering over the deck the light fixture will not be visible
from outside of the building. Commissioner Shayman asked if there will be screening
on the south side of the deck. Mr. Webster noted that a metal fabric will act as a
screening but will have a fair amount of translucency but will not be transparent. A
vertical garden can be grown or installed on this fabric.

Following the petitioner's presentation, Chairman Shapiro opened the meeting to public
comments.

Paul Tuszynski, member of the Thorngate Homeowner's Association and Village of
Riverwoods Zoning Board of Appeals, but spoke as a Riverwood's resident. Mr.
Tuszynski asked the petitioner if the existing fence will remain or if it will be torn down.
Mr. Abbott commented that that one side of the fence belongs to the adjacent bank and
the south side fence belongs to Parkway North. Mr. Tuszynski is concerned about the
vehicle lights coming from the parking lot and about the height of the driveway as
vehicles exit the property. He wonders if the vehicle lights will hit the first row of homes
across from the subject property. Mr. Doland stated that the county requires that this
driveway will be a street level. Mr. Tuszynski wanted to know hours of operation. Mr.
Abbott stated that the hours will be 7:00AM ­ 10:00 PM. Mr. Abbott stated that he is
willing to work with his neighbors and if there are any problems that arise they are more
than willing to listen and work things out.

Chairman Shapiro wanted clarification on the number of employees that will work at the
proposed restaurant. Mr. Abbott noted that the total number of employees for this
business will be 10 but 5 or less employees will only be working at one time.

David Schrieber, president of the Thorngate Homeowner's Association, was asked by
their board to speak on this redevelopment. Mr. Schrieber stated that Mr. and Mrs.
Abbott have been very forthcoming to himself and their association about wanting to
work with their board about any concerns. Based on Thorngate's recent HOA meeting,
their board is not in favor of the commercialization development of a restaurant across
the street from the Thorngate community. Mr. Schrieber noted that Thorngate is a very
private residential community and the Thorngate Board is very concerned about vehicle
lights coming into their community as vehicles are coming down the proposed
restaurant driveway as they exit the site. The Thorngate Board also anticipates an
increase in vehicular accidents and traffic delays from the vehicles entering and exiting
the site. Mr. Schrieber asked the Village Board to consider his comments and reiterated
that the Thorngate community is against any commercial development in close
proximity or across the street from their subdivision.

Mark Finch, Thorngate resident for 12 years, owns the home that backs up to the Exxon
Mobile gas station across Saunders Road. Mr. Finch feels that the Deerfield Road and
Saunders Road intersection is very dangerous and has seen many accidents take place
there especially due to the entry points for the Exxon Mobile gas station at that
intersection. Mr. Finch is very concerned about future development if this parcel is
rezoned for commercial use. One of the beauties of the Riverwoods community is that
it is very low key. Mr. Finch also had concerns about the Exxon Mobile gas station
signage. Chairman Shapiro noted that the Exxon Mobile station is under Riverwoods
jurisdiction. Mr. Finch had his fence heightened and reinforced because people were
cutting through his yard to get to the gas station to get a snack and believes that this will
increase again if a restaurant is built.

Commissioner Moyer asked the petitioner (who also owns the Exxon Mobile gas
station) how long the corner parcel has been a gas station. Mr. Abbott commented that
he is the second owner of the station and it has been a gas station for at least 15-18
years. Commissioner Moyer asked if the gas station was there before the Thorngate
subdivision was built. The petitioner confirmed that the gas station was there before the
Thorngate subdivision was built. Mr. Abbott also commented that he has not witnessed
a lot of accidents at that location and they are conscious about lighting at the gas
station. As for vehicle lights going into the Thorngate subdivision at their proposed
restaurant, Mr. Abbott noted that he anticipates their main business will be during lunch
hours. Mr. Abbott commented that they are committed to being a good neighbor to the
community and will always be willing to work with the community in resolving issues.

Shannon Erickson, a Riverwoods resident, has friends and a relative that live in the
Thorngate community that are excited about the proposed restaurant. He and a lot of
his neighbors believe that the proposed restaurant will be welcome improvement to the
Public Hearing
April 11, 2013
Page 10

community Mr. Erickson commented that the same people that don't want development
also didn't want the bike path that was proposed near the Thorngate community. Mr.
Erickson noted that once the economy improves the Parkway North properties south of
the site that are for sale will be developed for commercial uses. He also commented
that the Exxon Mobile gas station has been in existence for 30 years and there are not
have a lot of vehicular accidents at that location.

Commissioner Nadler asked Mr. Ryckaert for the zoning of the Parkway North
properties for sale to the south of the subject property. Mr. Ryckaert stated that the
properties to the south are zoned, I-1, Office. The west end of the Parkway North
Center properties along Saunders Road has yet to be developed. At one time in the
past on the western side of Parkway North, there was a 5-story office building
(approximately 250,000 square feet) that was approved but its approval has now
expired.

Commissioner Berg motioned to close the public hearing. Commissioner Bromberg
seconded the motion.

There being no further business to discuss the meeting adjourned.

Respectfully submitted,
Daniel Nakahara

                               VILLAGE OF DEERFIELD

The Plan Commission of the Village of Deerfield held a Workshop Meeting at 7:30 P.M.
on April 11, 2013 at the Village Hall, 850 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, Illinois.

Chairman Shapiro called the meeting to order.

Present were:        Dan Shapiro, Chairman
                     Larry Berg
                     Alan Bromberg
                     Jim Moyer
                     Robert Nadler
                     Stuart Shayman

Absent:              Elaine Jacoby

Also present:        Jeff Ryckaert, Principal Planner
                     Kathleen LéVeque, Associate Planner

Discussion on the request to rezone the property at 780 Saunders Road from R-1
Single Family Residential District to C-2 Outlying Commercial District, for an
amendment to the Comprehensive Plan and a Special Use for a restaurant with outdoor
seating ­ Health O Wealth, Inc. (Anil and Upasana Abbott)

Commissioner Berg commented that he initially thought that a restaurant was an odd
use of this space but during this process he has changed his view. Other than build
another residential dwelling, he cannot imagine a less intrusive or restrictive use of this
piece of property. Commissioner Berg noted that the property is clearly not viable as a
single family home being surrounded by commercial properties and Saunders Road to
the west. Commissioner Berg feels that the restaurant could be a good fit for the Village
and residents of both Deerfield and Riverwoods and particularly the workers in the
adjacent office buildings. Commissioner Berg likes the green components of the
building and that it will be easy to walk to the restaurant from the office buildings. He
believes the properties to the south will be developed at some point and anticipates it
will be a much higher density than the proposed restaurant.

Commissioner Moyer agrees with Commissioner Berg and noted that the sustainability
efforts are wonderful. He would love to see electric vehicle charging stations in their
plan if it is feasible. Commissioner Moyer sees an upscale and sustainable restaurant
that will fit in well with the adjacent properties.

Chairman Shapiro noted that petitioners have made remarkable progress from their first
workshop meeting but he still has significant concerns with their plan. Chairman
Shapiro commented that this commercial use will be an isolated zoning district and is
concerned about spot zoning. Chairman Shapiro is not convinced that the trend of
Workshop Meeting
April 11, 2013
Page 2

development (as indicated by the petitioner) is commercial and referenced that the
Comprehensive Plan has this parcel for office uses with respect to future zoning.
Chairman Shapiro feels that these standards for rezoning are not being fulfilled. He is
troubled with the numerous variation requests especially with the setbacks and the
parking. Chairman Shapiro is also concerned with the turning areas for vehicles on the
site particularly for larger trucks which would have to back up to mover around northeast
turn and while this has been addressed and appears to be doable, it is not ideal. He is
very concerned for the safety of the vehicles exiting this site and turning left onto
Saunders Road.

Commissioner Nadler initially had concerns from a business aspect in terms of the
viability of the site. However upon reflection and discussion, Commissioner Nadler
realizes that the Plan Commission is not there to judge whether or not a location will be
successful or not for a restaurant but rather is should be judged in terms of the
variances and zoning requests. Commissioner Nadler is greatly comforted in the fact
that Lake County Department of Transportation has approved a full access drive on
Saunders Road and gives him a vote of confidence that they have reviewed and
analyzed the access driveway. In terms of spot zoning, he is not concerned about this
aspect since it is currently spot zoned in its present residential use. Commissioner
Nadler is impressed with the petitioner's team of consultants and their dedication to
making this plan work. The variances are not a concern since the petitioner is only 2
parking spots short of the requirement. Commissioner Nadler does have personal
doubts on the success of this business because of the locational issues but he dose not
want that to cloud his view as a member of the Plan Commission. Commissioner
Nadler looks favorably on this petition.

Commissioner Bromberg is not concerned with the spot zoning. He noted that it is
important to remember that this business will be predominately for the lunch crowd and
not during evening hours. As far as left turns out of this property, he feels that there are
other areas that exhibit a worse situation. Commissioner Bromberg noted that he lives
next door to the Riverwoods Police Chief and he has discussed this intersection with
him. The Riverwoods Police Chief did not feel that this was a dangerous intersection
and in 2012 there were 8 accidents at that intersection. Commissioner Bromberg
commented that any accident is too many but this number is not significant during the
course of a year. Commissioner Bromberg initially thought that this was an unusual use
of this property but now feels that it is an excellent use of the property. He also
commented that this use would generate sales tax for the Village.

Commissioner Shayman had no issues with the zoning or the variances and feels that
they can make allowances in order to make this project work. This project is in a
location that these types of variances will not have an adverse affect on any neighboring
properties. This is a nicely laid out plan and although the left turn out of the property will
remain an issue hopefully motorists will use good sense when exiting the property.

Prefiling Conference #2: Rezoning and Development of 780 Saunders Road.

Brett Webster, Project Manager with Shive-Hattery, introduced Anil and Upasana
Abbott, owners of 780 Saunders Road as well as civil engineer, Jason Doland of Doland
Engineering.

Mr. Webster noted that the proposed size of the building and its deck have not changed
since the first workshop meeting, but the building did get moved. The aspects of this
project that have been addressed since the last meeting include adjusting the parking
sizes, drive aisles and rear and side yard landscaping. The landscaping design has
been adjusted but the landscaping level of detail will not be addressed in this workshop
meeting.

The main change in the site plan is the Lake County Department of Transportation
(LDOT) has asked that the right-of-way be moved 10' to the east which shifted the
building and the associated dining area 10' to the east toward the parking lot. The
petitioner is seeking a variation to the front yard setback requirement of 50'. The
petitioner interprets the current front yard setback at 25' measured from the building
structure. The petitioner noted that the staff memo recognizes this calculation at 18'6"
because it is measured from the outdoor deck structure. The petitioner is also seeking
a variation from the 12' side yard setback requirement. Staff calculates the proposed
side yard at 6.9' measured from the south property line to the outdoor deck.

Mr. Webster noted that due to the size of the lot, the same restraints exist. The parking
lot configuration will remain the same but the lot coverage has changed due to the
smaller parcel size. The requirements for lot coverage appear to be met.

Jason Doland noted that since the last meeting he has engaged in discussions with
different engineers and consultants regarding the impacts of development for this site.
Mr. Doland oriented the audience to the site recalling that the site borders commercial
property to north, Parkway North Center to the south and east and Saunders Road to
the west. The front of the building is west toward Saunders Road. Mr. Doland noted
key elements imperative to the site. The first being that the owners have been in
discussions with the Parkway North Center property managers and they have reached a
cooperative effort towards obtaining a water main tap east of the subject property. Mr.
Doland also noted that after extensive research they have located an easily accessible
sanitary sewer to service the property.

Mr. Doland is very conscious of stormwater management and believes that the best way
to protect a neighbor is to not overburden them with stormwater runoff. In this case,
they will promote the infiltration of ground water recharge as opposed to letting water
flow slowly from the property. Mr. Doland noted that there are recharge basins to the
east and south of the property that will not only stop the stormwater but also take out
pollutants before they get down stream.
Workshop Meeting
February 28, 2013
Page 3

Mr. Doland has had numerous discussions and meetings with Lake County Department
of Transportation regarding site access for the subject property. After careful and
thoughtful analysis of their roadway and trip generation attributed to the proposed
restaurant, LCDOT has provided full vehicular access to the site. There will be no
vehicle turning restrictions to or from the property.

Commissioner Moyer asked if the parking on site could be addressed. Mr. Doland
commented that parking is a calculation of the seating capacity and building square
footage and the confusing issue in this case deals with the outdoor seating and how that
area is calculated with respect to the parking. This discussion goes toward seating
capacity in the restaurant. The proposed seating capacity is 60 people and this
capacity does not change with the outdoor seating area. Commissioner Jacoby
commented that the outdoor area being available throughout the year brings the front
yard setback to 18'6" because that part of the structure extends farthest to the property
line. Mr. Webster explained that they took the front yard setback from the building and
not from the outdoor element because the outdoor element is not habitable 365 days of
the year. Commissioner Jacoby asked if the outdoor seating area was screened. Mr.
Webster noted that screen-like material is a privacy element that serves as a visual and
privacy barrier. Mr. Webster realizes that however the front yard setback measurement
is calculated a variation is needed. Mr. Webster stated that if the outdoor element
needs to be adjusted for some percentage of the variation they would welcome that
conversation with the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA). Mr. Webster understands that
they will have to get approval from the BZA for the variations and approval from the
Appearance Review Committee regarding the appearance of their building.

Commissioner Bromberg wanted clarification of the seating in the restaurant. Mr.
Webster stated that the seating capacity will not change and there is no intent to
increase seating capacity in good weather. Mr. Webster commented that the seating
capacity is dependent on the parking and there would be no reason to increase the
seating if there is nowhere to park on the site. He also acknowledged that this
restaurant is promoting a healthy lifestyle and utilizes the walking and bike paths in the
area for their customers.

Upasana Abbott, owner of 780 Saunders Road, commented that she is a food scientist
specialist and has been in this profession for 30 years. Mrs. Abbott is currently working
as in new product development for a major food company. The concept of this
restaurant is to serve healthy and fresh food and live a healthy lifestyle. The building
will be eco-friendly, be a no-waste restaurant and the outdoor deck serves a very big
part of this restaurant concept.

Chairman Shapiro commented to the petitioner that they have made some nice changes
since the last meeting especially in the accessibility to the site. Chairman Shapiro noted
that there are still issues that have been pointed out by staff that need to be addressed.
He would like to see a traffic and parking evaluation, where loading berths would be
located on the site and review the proposed signage.
Workshop Meeting
February 28, 2013
Page 4


Mrs. Abbott commented that they have connected their restaurant to the existing
walking paths that lead to the adjacent Parkway North office buildings and are expecting
a lot of their customers to come from theses office building. Mrs. Abbott anticipates a
good portion of their business will be walk-ins and carryout/delivery service to office
buildings and alleviate the need for parking on their site.

Commissioner Bromberg noted that the anticipated hours of operation are 7:00 AM to
10:00 PM and asked if they are expecting to be open that late. Mrs. Abbott would like to
be open during that period and do more business but they are expecting to be more of a
breakfast and lunch type of restaurant.

There being no further questions or discussion, Chairman Shapiro stated to the
petitioner that the next step in this process is to complete the application and address
the issues that Staff has pointed out. Once the application is complete, a public hearing
can be scheduled. Mrs. LéVeque noted the possibility of March 28, 2013 for their public
hearing if the application is complete. Chairman Shapiro would like a complete traffic
and parking evaluation and asks that the traffic expert talk to LCDOT and address the
submitted LCDOT letter on full access in the traffic report.

Mr. Webster hopes to have all requirements met so that they are able to be on the
March 28th agenda for a public hearing. Mr. Webster concluded that he will be in touch
with the BZA and the ARC and hopes of meeting their requirements concurrently.

Prefiling Conference: Rezoning and Development of 780 Saunders Road

Brett Webster, Project Manager, Shive-Hattery, is assisting the owners on the proposed
restaurant at 780 Saunders Road. Mr. Webster has been working with staff on the
proposed rezoning, Special Use, and specific zoning requirements that pertain to this
project. The main focus of this presentation is to present the concept and some of the
challenges of the site. Additional information that Mr. Webster submitted to the
Commission at the beginning of their presentation is in response to a memorandum from
staff dated December 6, 2012, and includes a revised site plan and issues which will most
likely require variations.

Upasana Abbott and her husband Anil, owners of 780 Saunders Road, purchased the
property in the beginning of 2012. Mr. Abbott has been operating the gas station on the
corner Deerfield and Saunders Road and both he and his wife feel that they are in tune
with customer base in the area. Mrs. Abbott is a food scientist in product development and
passionate about health food. The restaurant was conceived from customer feedback that
there were no restaurants in the area that served healthy foods. The concept is to
establish a healthy food restaurant that serves freshly prepared casual meals and some
prepackaged foods. Mrs. Abbott noted that the restaurant will be eco-friendly and be a no-
waste restaurant.

Jason Doland, Doland Engineering, noted that he would be talking about four main site
civil topics related to this site from his professional perspective: site access, sanitary
sewer service, water service and stormwater management.

Mr. Doland has discussed site access with the Lake County Department of Transportation
(LCDOT). Saunders Road has a significant amount of traffic and has a dedicated left turn
lane that is twice as long as a typical left turn lane. The proposed restaurant site is at the
midway point of the dedicated left turn lane on Saunders Road. Mr. Doland commented
that he has discussed this with LCDOT and they will be involved in the process with them
to discern the safest and best way to gain access to this site. There is an enormous
amount of data research, traffic analysis and car counts that LCDOT wants to look at for
the petitioner, but only if there is at least a favorable direction from the Village on the
proposal. If there is a favorable direction, then LCDOT will address traffic counts and road
analysis.

Mr. Doland commented that depending on what the data shows the options for access to
the property could be full and unrestricted access; right-in and unrestricted out access; or
right-in and right-out access. LCDOT is ready and willing to dedicate staff hours to their
level of research so long as they can come back knowing that this project is at least a
viable project.

Commissioner Bromberg commented that access from the north will be critical to this site.
Mr. Doland noted that they will be going through the analysis with LCDOT and LCDOT will
have the decision on what type of access the petitioners get on Saunders Road. Mr.
Workshop Meeting
December 13, 2012
Page 9

Doland noted that LCDOT will analyze how much of the left turn lane is used and note
stacking during peak hours. The most important component is the stacking in the left turn
lane and if there are gaps for southbound vehicles turning left into the site.

Commissioner Nadler wanted to clarify that the petitioner is seeking more than just a right-
in, right-out access. Mr. Doland stated that they are seeking more than just a right-in,
right-out access. Commissioner Nadler asked if the bank owned the accessway north of
the subject property and if there were any conversations to work out an agreement to
share that access drive. Mr. Doland noted that they worked significantly toward shared
access with the bank, but with no success.

Mr. Doland commented that sanitary sewer service is approximately 150' to the south of
the property which may pose a challenge but it is available. There are two options for
water service. One option is approximately 600' away in the public right-of-way and the
other option is a little closer but on private property which would require easement
coordination. Mr. Doland commented that sanitary sewer and water will require LCDOT
coordination because the mains are in the right-of-way for Saunders Road.

Mr. Doland is very conscious of stormwater management and believes that the best way to
protect a neighbor is to not overburden them with stormwater runoff. In this case Mr.
Doland will be following the Lake County and Village stormwater runoff ordinance and
working with Village engineers towards final engineering documents and permit drawings
that will be developed for stormwater management purposes to encourage groundwater
recharge infiltration in lieu of runoff. Mr. Doland commented that instead of using a
restrictor plate and letting water runoff, they can use open gravel bottomed storm
chambers to allow for infiltration and to discourage conveying water as much as possible.

Chairman Shapiro referred to an aerial image of the site and wanted to clarify ownership of
the accessway north of the site. Mr. Doland confirmed that the accessway is owned by the
bank and serves as an in-only access point. A discussion ensued around this access
point. Commissioner Nadler asked Mr. Doland if there were any thoughts of deeding some
land to increase this accessway. Mr. Doland commented that swapping land for the
purpose of further widening the access point for shared use was their initial conversation
with the bank but the bank was not interested.

Chairman Shapiro commented that there are three existing curb cuts in this area (2 with
the gas station and 1 with the bank) and it may be difficult for LCDOT to create a fourth.
Mr. Doland noted that they are using the existing apron that was used for the residential
property. Commissioner Bromberg pointed out that the gas station and the bank
properties reside in Riverwoods jurisdiction.

Mr. Doland's hope is that should they receive a favorable direction on the use or its
concept then he would have a commission to go forward to further develop these details of
these previously discussed challenges. Commissioner Shayman asked that if the site is
restricted to right-in, right-out access from Saunders Road, how this impacts the concept.
Workshop Meeting
December 13, 2012
Page 10

Mr. Doland commented that at that point cost and benefit analysis would dictate to the
owners if the project is viable.

Commissioner Jacoby asked the hours of operation for the gas station. Mr. Abbott stated
that the gas station is open from, Monday­Friday, 5:00 AM­11:00 PM, Saturday 6:00 AM-
11:00 PM and Sunday, 6:00 AM-10:00 PM.

Commissioner Nadler asked if Parkway North would provide a curb cut to the parking lot.
Mr. Doland stated that the conversation with Parkway North has been about pedestrian
and walking traffic and not about vehicular traffic. Mr. Doland commented that a
discussion of an access point on the Parkway North property could come about should
they receive a worst case scenario of a right-turn in and right-turn out access.

Commissioner Berg asked how far the left turn lane extends from this property line. Mr.
Doland stated that the left turn lane extends another 250 feet south from their property line.
Commissioner Berg asked if the site plan could be flipped with the access point on the
south part of the property and the building moved to the north. Mr. Doland commented
that this layout could exist through the development process but at this point it is their
preference to use the existing apron because it has already been allowed. Mr. Doland
noted that the property is 100 feet long and moving the access to the south would put the
access drive at the end of the turn bay. Should LCDOT find in the analysis that turn bay
could be shortened such that the access point in the site plan could be flipped then this
reconfiguration would happen. From a site engineering standpoint this would work fine if it
helped to alleviate the traffic burden.

Commissioner Berg feels that sharing the access on Saunders Road with the bank's
entrance and possibly the bank's exit point on Deerfield Road would alleviate a lot of the
traffic issues.

Commissioner Nadler noted that restaurants are very capital intensive and expensive and
have the highest failure rate of any retail concept. Commissioner Nadler offered his
personal opinion to the petitioner based on his retail real estate background by noting that
this restaurant location, aside from access issues, poses many disadvantages to being
successful. It is his opinion that the petitioner search for a location that will be more
compatible for success. From a Plan Commission perspective, Mr. Nadler has issues with
the proposal and at this point is not looking favorably on the project.

Chairman Shapiro believes the petitioner has worked hard on a difficult site. Above and
beyond access, Chairman Shapiro and sees issues in lot coverage, parking and other
things that were mentioned in the staff report. Chairman Shapiro pointed out that he is not
in favor of the rezoning because a residential subdivision exists across Saunders Road.

Mr. Webster understands the main concerns that have been discussed and asked the
Commission if they should continue with their presentation on the architecture. Chairman
Workshop Meeting
December 13, 2012
Page 11

Shapiro commented that a discussion on the project's architecture may be premature at
this stage but welcomed the petitioner to continue with their presentation.

Commissioner Berg commented that the proposed site could be accessed from Deerfield
Road along the eastern portion of the gas station but would require an easement from the
bank.

Carlos Concepcion, Director of Operations at Shive-Hattery, discussed the proposed
architecture of the project. The architecture of the project gets its inspiration from the
business concept and mission statement dealing with wellness and healthy living. These
concepts translated architecturally into theme of light and transparency. Mr. Concepcion
displayed a variety of images that projected the design concepts and the spirit of the
restaurant. The building design reflects the issues of wellness and sustainability which will
also be seen in the use of the building materials.

The restaurant is a 3,000 square foot space which will account for 60% (1,800 square feet)
devoted to the carry-out operation and 40% (1,200 square feet) devoted to the sit down
dining operation. The restaurant will have an office space, food preparation and storage
space, seating area, two restrooms and an outdoor deck.

The outdoor deck is essentially a connection between the outdoor paths and the street and
in good weather conditions serves as an area to displace some of the seating from the
inside to the outside. The outdoor deck does not add seating for customers as it is used to
displace customers to the outside in good weather conditions. Recycled materials will be
used in constructing the building, especially the deck, and the petitioner will seek LEED
building certification. There were discussions that the square footage of the outdoor deck
would be included into restaurant space and would therefore increase the number of
parking spaces required for the site. Mr. Concepcion noted that the deck itself is an
element of circulation with the idea that it would attract bicyclists and runners/walkers and
other outdoor enthusiast to get a beverage or meal similar to a fast food operation for
pedestrians.

The parking area is proposed to be accessed from Saunders Road and contains 35
parking spaces including two handicap spaces. The traffic will flow in a counter-clockwise
direction.

The building envelope is anticipated to be primarily constructed of glass and a perforated
metal material. Mr. Concepcion displayed concept renderings of the restaurant.

Mr. Concepcion noted that there were a number of issues mostly related to parking sizes,
setbacks and drive aisle sizes that have all been addressed with recommendations by
Village staff. Mr. Concepcion noted that a lot of thought and planning has gone into this
concept and its functionality. He believes not only that this project is legitimate but will be
a significant addition to the area.
Workshop Meeting
December 13, 2012
Page 12

Commissioner Jacoby likes the idea of this project but acknowledged the challenges for
the site. The issues of fitting this restaurant on this site, parking space sizes, drive aisles
and most importantly the access for the site are going to be a challenge. Mr. Concepcion
realizes that this is not an easy site but it is a good site to work with and he foresees the
adjacent office park utilizing this restaurant.

Commissioner Bromberg feels that this property should not be zoned R-1 Residential and
agrees with most, if not all, of the comments made by Commissioner Nadler. He is not
sure it is the Plan Commission's place to decide whether or not a restaurant is successful
at this site, but more of a question as to whether it is a good use of this space.
Commissioner Bromberg feels that this could be a good use of the property aside from the
access issues. Commissioner Shayman views the access and parking as major issues for
this project. The site does not lend itself to overflow parking areas and only contains one
access point.

Mr. Abbott commented that they surveyed the surrounding offices and the neighborhood
and found that customers are looking for healthy foods and that there is a demand for a
food establishment in this area.

Chairman Shapiro asked Mr. Doland if he has enough direction from the Commission to
proceed with LCDOT. Mr. Doland asked if the zoning request, land use, building to
parking ratio and setbacks are things the Commission would look favorably upon or even
consider. If so, he will be equipped with enough to proceed with LCDOT. If these
elements are favorable Mr. Doland will be able to look at the details of access and usability
of the site toward this use. Commissioner Bromberg noted that there are clearly issues
with parking. Chairman Shapiro stated that there are several variations that will have to be
considered with some being more difficult than others. Chairman Shapiro does not feel the
entire Commission is convinced this project is viable because of the variations, parking,
setbacks and especially the access. Commissioner Berg commented that he has issues
with the parking variations and parking space sizes and would like to hear from a traffic
expert that reducing the size of the parking stalls will be adequate if that is what the
petitioner is proposing. Commissioner Berg likes the concept and the design of the
restaurant but the parking and access issues are not something that is readily resolved.

Mr. Webster noted that the material submitted this evening does highlight issues that have
been addressed and resolved. Mr. Webster stated that they are not able to resolve the 50'
front setback due to the size of the parcel. As proposed the front setback is at 25'.
Commissioner Nadler asked the petitioner if the property owner to the south would be
willing to sell them a small portion of their land to increase their parcel size. Mr. Abbott
noted that they have talked to the land owner to the south and they are only willing to sell
the entire parcel. A discussion ensued about the possibilities of acquiring some land to the
south and its configuration in relation to the site which would remove the need for some of
the variances.

Mr. Webster acknowledged that they understand the larger issues of ease of access and
parking continue to exist and that the front setback will be a challenge. Mr. Webster
wanted to illustrate that that the interpretation of the outdoor seating area as it applies to
the parking count will not exacerbate the parking situation due to the way the business will
operate. Commissioner Bromberg likes the concept but reiterated his concerns regarding
parking and access. Commissioner Jacoby asked the petitioner if they would consider
reducing the size of the deck area and relocating it to the east end of the building.

Commissioner Berg asked the petitioner if they are thinking about increasing seating
capacity during the warmer months or just readjusting seating. Mr. Webster stated that
they would be spreading out seating and not increasing the seating. Mr. Concepcion
commented that the seating area in the restaurant will also double as a retail space with
vertical display elements. Mr. Concepcion wanted to clarify this in the floor plan so it would
not be mistaken for indoor seating and added that the area is considered as much of a
retail space as a restaurant. Mr. Concepcion was not sure if this would affect the required
parking count. Commissioner Shayman suggested that the seating for the restaurant be
restricted to conform to the parking requirements and this could be written into the
recommendation. Commissioner Bromberg likes the restaurant concept, but parking and
access are concerns. Commissioner Jacoby asked if the deck could be moved or reduced
in size. Mr. Concepcion commented that the outdoor deck is critical to the concept of this
restaurant because it reinforces the concept of healthy eating and the sustainable space.
The outdoor deck could be reduced a bit so it becomes more path-like (the outdoor area is
intended to be an extension and connection of the outdoor path and the street). The
petitioner would not like to see the outdoor deck shifted as it would suggest that it was an
optional space for the restaurant.

Commissioner Bromberg commented that in the staff memo stated that there would be a
maximum of 20-30 patrons at one time but the following paragraph describes that the floor
plan indicates seating for 40 patrons. This inconsistency will have to be cleaned up to
ensure that there is enough parking for the number of seating in the restaurant.

Mr. Webster was pleased with this discussion and thanked the Commission for their
focused attention and advice.

Chairman Shapiro suggested the petitioners could come back to the Plan Commission for
another prefiling conference.

 Dear Ms. LeVeque:

 On February 1, 2013, the Lake County Division of Transportation (LCDOT) met with Doland
 Engineering, LLC and the property owners of the parcel at 780 Saunders Road to discuss plans
 for a new restaurant at this location. After review of the preliminary traffic analysis, the LCDOT
 will approve a full access off of Saunders Road for the parce l. The applicant must abide by the
 provisions of the LCDOT's Highway Access Regulation Ordinance as well as work through the
 Major Access Permit Process with the LCDOT.

 Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at (847) 377-7400.

            the proposed premises, under the International Fire Code (2000 Edition)

                April11 , 2013. Enclosed please find 12 sets of the following documents requested for the Village staff and
                Plan Commission review and comment:

                 ·      Revised site plan, dated 3/27/13

                 ·      Special Use Criteria letter, dated 3/27/13
                 ·      Rezoning Standards letter, dated 3/27/13
                 ·      Sustainable Design letter, dated 3/27/13

                 Also enclosed please find a CD with the pdf files of the documents listed above.


                We offer the following explanation of site plan changes and additional documents provided to address
                Plan Commission concerns from the Workshop hearing on February 28, 2013.


                 ·      We have revised the site plan from the Feb. 28, 2013 PC Workshop meeting to address the
                        comments and concerns of the Village staff and the Plan Commission. We have a total of three
                        variations: Front Yard setback (25 feet in lieu of 50 feet), South Side Yard setback (6.9 feet in
                        lieu of 12 feet), and Parking Stall quantity (33 stalls in lieu of 35). The reduction of two parking
                        stalls provides for better traffic circulation as vehicles will have more room to maneuver around
                        the East end of the parking lot. We believe that these variations are necessary for the feasible
                        development of a building size that can accommodate a restaurant of this type.
                 ·      We have enclosed letters addressing the Comprehensive Plan Amendment request, Special
                        Use Criteria, and Rezoning Standards that address the topics to be considered.

             o    The enclosed Traffic Impact Study provides evidence that the proposed restaurant will generate
                  a low volume of traffic that will be accommodated by the full access driveway and the proposed
                  parking lot layout.
             o    We have added a detailed landscape plan and existing tree inventory plan to comply with the
                  Village requirements for parking lot screening.
             o    An interior trash and recycling room has been added to the floor plan to comply with the Village
                  requirements for a fully screened trash storage area. The Owners will move the trash/recycling
                  containers outside before or after business hours for a trash hauling service to collect. The
                  amount of material to be removed is anticipated to be minimal. See the explanation provided in
                  the Sustainable Design letter enclosed.
             ·    Additional information on the wall sign and the ground sign has been provided on the West
                  building elevation to demonstrate compliance with the Village requirements.

             We anticipate that this summary and explanation will address the concerns and comments
             discussed to date. We look forward to presenting the proposed project to the Plan Commission on
             April 11, 2013. Please call me with any further questions or concerns.

                                                      Special Use Criteria
                                                      Health O Wealth Inc.
                                                      780 Saunders Road
                                                          Deerfield, IL


              1. Compatible with Existing Development

                    The nature and intensity of the activities involved in the size, placement and design of
                    any structures proposed will be so planned that the Special Use will be compatible with
                    the existing development and will not impede the normal and orderly development and
                    improvement of surrounding property.

                    Response: Health O Wealth Inc. proposes to operate a small healthy food café serving freshly
                    prepared casual meals and limited retail sales of prepackaged foods. The restaurant is
                    designed to enhance the surrounding property through the use of light, transparent building
                    materials intended to reflect the mission statement of inspiring wellness and healthy living. The
                    appropriately scaled structure is positioned on the lot so as to encourage use and access by
                    occupants of the neighboring properties via walking or cycling in addition to traditional motorized
                    vehicles. A connection to the existing pedestrian/cycling path on the adjacent property
                    emphasizes the compatibility with the existing surrounding developments.

              2. Lot of Sufficient Size

                    The size of the lot will be sufficient for the use proposed.

                    Response: The size of the lot adequately accommodates the parking required for a proposed
                    restaurant anticipated to have 60% carry-out customers and 40% dine-in customers.

              3. Traffic

                    The location of the Special Use within the Village will be such that adverse effects on
                    surrounding properties will be minimal, particularly regarding the traffic generated by the
                    Special Use.

                    Response: The size of the proposed restaurant accommodates a maximum seating capacity of
                    60 customers. The traffic impact study enclosed as prepared by TADI supports that minimal
                    traffic will be generated by this business and that adverse effects on surrounding properties are
                    anticipated to be minimal if not altogether negligible.

              4. Parking and Access

                    Parking areas will be of adequate size for the particular use and properly located, and the
                    entrance and exit drives will be laid out so as to prevent traffic hazards and nuisances.

                    Response: The parking areas provided will be adequate in size to accommodate customer and
                    delivery vehicles as illustrated by the enclosed vehicle turning diagrams. The capacity and
                    volume of supplies/waste removal required to support this business is low enough as to reduce


Project # 8121561
                                                                                                                    Page 2 of 2




                   the frequency of deliveries/loading and the size of vehicles delivering the supplies/hauling away
                   waste. Delivery/loading times will be controlled by the Owners to limit interference between
                   delivery vehicles and customer vehicles. The entrance and exit drive has been approved for full
                   access from Saunders Road by Lake County Division of Transportation per the letter provided
                   to the Village dated Feb. 21, 2013.

              5. Effect on Neighborhood

                   In all respects the Special Use will not be significantly or materially detrimental to the
                   health, safety and welfare of the public or injurious to the other property of
                   improvements in the neighborhood, nor will it diminish or impair property values in the
                   surrounding area.

                   Response: In all respects the proposed restaurant will be constructed and operated to not be
                   significantly or materially detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the public or injurious
                   to the other property or improvements in the neighborhood, nor will it diminish or impair property

              3. Suitability of Present Zoning

                   The suitability of the property in question for the uses permitted under the existing
                   zoning classification and the proposed classification.

                   Response: The property in question is currently zoned R-1 Single Family Residential which is
                   not suitable to the proposed restaurant use. In order to provide suitability for the proposed
                   restaurant use, the proposed classification requested is C-2 Outlying Commercial District.

              4. Trend of Development

                   The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the property in question,
                   including changes, if any, which may have taken place since the day the property in
                   question was placed in it's present zoning classification.

                   Response: The trend of development in the general area of the property (East of Saunders
                   Road) is office/research use as identified in the Village Future Land Use Map in the
                   Comprehensive Plan. To the North and outside of the Village boundaries (East of Saunders
                   Road), the trend of development is commercial use. Significant changes have taken place since
                   the property in question was placed in in the present zoning classification of R-1 Single Family
                   Residential. The East side of Saunders Road within and outside of the Village boundaries has
                   moved away from residential uses and toward generally commercial uses.

                   Shive-Hattery has incorporated many environmentally friendly design practices into the Health
                   O Wealth restaurant project that directly correlates with the ideals of inspiring wellness and
                   healthy living proposed by the Owners. With guidance from the LEED (Leadership in Energy
                   and Environmental Design) program as a model, the project will be environmentally responsible
                   to its surroundings.

                   The site will be improved through several different design features. The storm water system will
                   incorporate a storm water recharge and infiltration basin to promote water infiltration and reduce
                   offsite water flow. The site lighting will be designed to reduce light trespass or pollution to
                   surrounding areas. The roof materials will be highly reflective, reducing the heat island effect on
                   the site.

                   Consideration of regional and microclimatic conditions played an important role in the selection and
                   placement of plant materials. Native and adapted plant materials were selected for their adaptability
                   to normal rainfall conditions and year round interest. Varieties of native and adapted Maples, Filberts
                   and Ironwood trees help define various uses throughout the site and provide shade to outdoor use
                   areas. Native ground layer grasses, perennials and shrubs including Sumac, Viburnum, Redcedar,
                   Prairie Dropseed, Blueflag Iris and various sedges will provide color and texture throughout the year
                   while reducing the need for supplemental watering. The storm water recharge and filtration basin will
                   be planted with native sedges and forbs.

                   In terms of building operations, HVAC, lighting and other building systems will meet energy
                   efficiency and ventilation standards to promote a healthy indoor environment. Keeping with the
                   idea of a healthy indoor environment, an environmentally friendly practice that will not be as
                   apparent is specifying the use of Low VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) emitting materials
                   (Adhesives, sealants, paints, etc.) Water use will also be reduced substantially through the use
                   of energy efficient fixtures and controls throughout.

                   A prominent practice that will be in place on the site is an intensive program to limit the amount
                   of waste being removed from the site. There will be a recycling/composting program to virtually
                   eliminate waste from entering the surrounding landfills. Not only will this be supported by the
                   Owners through the materials brought into the building (recyclable/compostable containers,
                   etc.), but the program will involve the customers with a three bin disposal setup of waste,
                   recyclable and compostable material. Composting will occur on-site and be educational to the
                   patrons that visit this establishment.

                   Alternative transportation is encouraged by the structures position on the lot so as to inspire use
                   and access by occupants of the neighboring properties via walking or cycling in addition to
                   traditional motorized vehicles. A connection to the existing pedestrian/cycling path on the
                   adjacent property emphasizes the compatibility with the existing surrounding developments.
                   Bike racks are incorporated into the buildings deck design.

                    The trend of development in the general area of the property (East of Saunders Road) is
                    office/research use as identified in the Village Future Land Use Map in the Comprehensive
                    Plan.

                    However, to the North and outside of the Village boundaries (East of Saunders Road), the trend
                    of development is commercial use. Significant changes have taken place since the property in
                    question was placed in in the present zoning classification of R-1 Single Family Residential. The
                    East side of Saunders Road within and outside of the Village boundaries has moved away from
                    residential uses and toward generally commercial uses.

                    Office/research uses do not generate sales tax revenue for the Village.

                    The Village will benefit from the redevelopment of this property as a commercial use by
                    collecting sales tax from proposed businesses that are allowed in the C-2 Outlying Commercial
                    zoning classification.

INTRODUCTION      

A traffic impact study was conducted for a proposed 3,000 square-foot restaurant in Deerfield, Illinois. The
restaurant is anticipated to have available seating for sixty (60) patrons. One full access driveway will be
provided for the site along Saunders Road, approximately 250 feet south of the Deerfield Road/Saunders
Road intersection. An aerial view of the study location and the surrounding roadway network is presented
in Exhibit 1.

As a part of this study, site trip generation characteristics were established for the new facility and the
future (Year 2019) traffic scenario was evaluated for the proposed access.

This report presents and documents TADI's data collection, summarizes the evaluation of traffic conditions
on the surrounding roadways, evaluates the proposed site plan, and details the potential impact of
development traffic on the adjacent roadway network.

EXISTING CONDITIONS  

TADI conducted field observations to collect relevant information pertaining to the site, existing land uses
in the surrounding area, the adjacent roadway network, current traffic volumes and operational conditions,
lane configurations and traffic controls, and other key roadway characteristics. A detailed account of this
information and findings are as follows.


Existing Land Uses 
The subject site is located along Saunders Road approximately 250 feet south of its intersection with
Deerfield Road in Deerfield, Illinois and is currently occupied by a private residence. Immediately north of
the site is Edens Bank with access via both Saunders Road and Deerfield Road. At the southeast corner of
the Saunders Road/Deerfield Road intersection and north of the bank access, is a Mobil gas station. An
office park, Parkway North Center, is located east and south of the proposed site along Parkway North.
Although not yet fully occupied, the office park currently provides offices for Walgreens University,
Friedman Corporation, and CF Industries Holdings as well as a Marriott Suites hotel and the Parkway
Athletic Club. One office parcel within the development maintains a parking lot bordering the east side of
the subject site.

The areas north of Deerfield Road and west of Saunders Road are generally residential in use. Several
business parks are also located further south along Saunders Road including businesses such as Diners
Club International, Discover Financial Services and the United States headquarters for Takeda Global
Research & Development and Takeda Pharmaceuticals.


Existing Roadway Characteristics  
A field investigation was conducted for Saunders Road within the study area.           A description of the
roadway is summarized below.

Saunders Road is a north-south arterial roadway under the jurisdiction of the Lake County Division of
Transportation (LCDOT). At the proposed site access, the roadway provides two through lanes in each
direction and a northbound left-turn lane extending south from the intersection with Deerfield Road. The
speed limit is posted as 45 MPH within the study area. Saunders Road intersects with Deerfield Road,
approximately 250 feet north of the site, and Parkway North, approximately a quarter mile south of the site.
In addition to the five-foot sidewalk provided on both sides of the roadway, a multi-use trail runs along the
east side of Saunders Road and around the adjacent office park (Parkway North Center).

Traffic Count Data 
A manual traffic count was performed on Saunders Road adjacent to the subject site in March 2013 during
the weekday morning (7:00-9:00 AM) and evening (4:00-6:00 PM) peak periods. The resulting traffic counts
indicate that the heaviest traveled hours occurred from 7:45 to 8:45 AM and 4:30 to 5:30 PM. The existing
traffic suggests a heavy directional split with 73% of traffic traveling southbound in the AM and 75% of traffic
traveling northbound in the PM. This split is likely representative of travel to and from the office park and
properties to the south residential areas to the north and vice versa in the evening. The existing traffic data is
presented in Exhibit 2.

FUTURE CONDITIONS 

This section of the report outlines the proposed development plan, summarizes site-specific traffic
characteristics, and develops future traffic projections for analysis.


Development Characteristics & Site Access 
The proposed development is planned to include a 3,000 square-foot restaurant. Access would be provided
to the site through a full access driveway on Saunders Road (Restaurant Drive). Currently, the site is
proposed to be developed as a healthy food café with 60% carry-out customers and 40% dine-in customers.
The restaurant is planned to include an outdoor patio and would utilize seasonal seating plans
accommodating a maximum of sixty (60) seats.


Trip Generation 
In order to calculate site-generated traffic projections for the proposed site, data was referenced from the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) manual titled Trip Generation, Ninth Edition. Trip generation
data for the appropriate ITE Land Use Code (LUC) is shown in Table 1. Copies of the ITE data are
provided in the appendix.

Directional Distribution  
After establishing the expected site traffic volumes, a projected trip distribution was derived from existing
traffic patterns in the study area and the nature of surrounding land uses. It was assumed that 40% of
traffic will travel to/from the north and that 60% will travel to/from the south. Traffic generated by the
new use was assigned to the adjacent roadway network and the proposed site access system according to
the distribution described above.


Projected Future Traffic 
The restaurant is expected to be constructed and occupied by Year 2014. Therefore, to represent a "Build + 5
Year" analysis horizon, Year 2019 is defined as the future condition analysis horizon for purposes of this
study. To account for potential growth of background traffic volumes in the area, a three percent annual
growth rate was applied to existing traffic volumes (equivalent to roughly 18 percent growth over 6 years),
consistent with LCDOT guidelines. Site-generated trips were added to the 2019 background traffic to yield
total volumes at the study intersections. The Future Scenario volumes are also illustrated in Exhibit 2.


Capacity Analysis 
Traffic volume data was analyzed with Highway Capacity Software (HCS) in order to determine the quality
of operation in the future network. Operation is characterized according to the amount of control delay at
each approach and quantified into a level of service (LOS). The LOS grades shown below, which are
provided in the Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), quantify and
categorize a driver's discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and travel times experienced as a result of
intersection control and the resulting traffic queuing. LOS D is typically the minimum acceptable LOS
accepted by agencies in Illinois (including LCDOT). A detailed description of each LOS rating can be found
in Table 3.

Table 4 presents the range of control delay for each LOS rating as detailed in the HCM. Because signalized
intersections are expected to carry a larger volume of vehicles and stopping is required during red time,
note that higher delays are tolerated for the corresponding LOS ratings.

    All movements with a Volume to Capacity (v/C) ratio greater than 1 receive a rating of LOS F. 

Based on the HCM standards, each approach and/or movement LOS was determined for the identified
weekday morning and evening peak hours. LOS data for the study intersection is reported in Table 5.

For the purposes of this unsignalized intersection analysis, the distribution of upstream traffic at the
Deerfield Road/Saunders Road intersection was incorporated with an assumed split of 75% traveling south
through the intersection on Saunders Road and 25% making a westbound left-turn from Deerfield Road.

1      Results based upon HCM 2010 Methodology. 

Analysis of the Year 2019 scenario suggests that the addition of site traffic will not cause significant delay
for Saunders Road traffic at the intersection with the site access. During the PM peak hour, the westbound
left-turn movement exiting the site is anticipated to operate at LOS E; however, the 95th percentile queue for
exiting traffic is projected to be less than one vehicle. It is not uncommon for the minor leg approach, and
particularly the left-turn movement, of a Two-Way Stop Controlled (TWSC) intersection with an arterial
roadway, such as Saunders Road, to operate below LOS D. Vehicles turning left from the minor street often
utilizes gaps in traffic flow created by adjacent upstream signalized intersections along Saunders Road at
Deerfield Road and Parkway North.


Site Access and Circulation Review 

This section describes and summarizes review of on-site vehicular circulation and outlines any related
recommendations. 

OnSite Queuing 

One access driveway is proposed for the subject site on Saunders Road. Review of projected outbound
vehicle queues, based on the capacity analysis, suggests that the 95th percentile queue projections for
vehicles exiting the site do not exceed one vehicle during either of the peak hours. Thus, exiting vehicle
queues are not expected to impact internal traffic circulation.

Parking

The proposed plan includes thirty-three (33) parking spaces Based on the Village's Ordinance, the off-street
parking requirements and calculations associated with the proposed plan are outlined below:

    Per the Village of Deerfield Zoning Ordinance Article 8.02E Required Spaces 

As shown in Table 6, the Village's off-street parking requirement for the proposed restaurant is 35 spaces.
The proposed site plan includes 33 off-street parking spaces with a requested variance allowing 33 off-street
parking spaces.

Due to lack of recirculation options for restaurant customers, TADI recommends that the western three to
four parallel parking stalls located along the north side of the site should be designated and signed as
employee parking only.

Trucks Access/Delivery 

A dumpster would be provided inside the building along the north wall. Access doors will be provided so
that the dumpster can be moved outside for collection. Vehicles expected to serve deliveries and service
vehicles are expected to be up to a thirty-foot (30') single-unit truck. AutoTURN for the design vehicle
provided by the architect indicate that the vehicle would enter, deliver products/collect refuse, and then
complete a three-point turn in the main parking area before exiting the site. The AutoTURN analysis
provided by the architect is provided in the attached appendix.

Based the anticipated truck turning patterns, the on-site truck circulation requires the use of several parking
spaces and the drive aisle. Therefore, TADI recommends that all loading, delivery, and refuse collection
must occur during off-business hours in order to avoid negatively impacting parking and circulation.

Circulation 

Vehicles would enter on the west side of the site and travel east across the north side of the proposed
restaurant. After passing the building, vehicles would make a right turn and travel through a parking drive
aisle. At the end of the parking aisle, vehicles would circulate counterclockwise around the east side of the
parking aisle, and exit after traveling back across the site.

Parking would be located on the east side of the site with parallel parking spaces along the north side of the
site. Based upon the AutoTURN analysis provided by the architect, it may be difficult for vehicles to easily
maneuver through the parking area without negatively impacting traffic circulation or conflicting with
parked vehicles. The parallel parking spaces on the east side of the site have been configured to
accommodate the vehicle turning pattern. The constraint width of the site, in combination with the
provision of parking, limits the ability for vehicles to recirculate counterclockwise again through the
parking drive aisle.

Access Site Distance 

Vertical sight distance does not appear to be an issue with any of the planned access locations, but care
should be taken with landscaping, signage, and monumentation to ensure that adequate horizontal sight
distance is provided from the stop bar locations.

CONCLUSIONS 

Based on TADI's review of the proposed site plan and evaluation of future traffic conditions with
development of the proposed restaurant, the proposed access at Saunders Road is expected to adequately
accommodate the proposed development. To date, LCDOT has approved a full access serving the
restaurant at the proposed location on Saunders Road.

In order to limit the impacts to traffic circulation and on-site parking, all delivery/service vehicle activity
should be limited to occur only during non-business hours. Parallel parking, indicated in the proposed
plan, is configured in such a way to accommodate the counterclockwise circulation pattern for a passenger
vehicle around the east side of the site. TADI recommends that three to four of the most western parallel
parking stalls should be designated for employee only parking.

If alterations to the site plan or land uses should occur, changes to the analysis within this traffic impact
study may be necessary.

                          Land Use: 932
                High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant

Descr iption

This land use consists of sit-down, full-service eating establishments with typical duration of stay of
approximately one hour. This type of restaurant is usually moderately priced and frequently belongs
to a restaurant chain. Generally, these restaurants serve lunch and dinner; they may also be open
for breakfast and are sometimes open 24 hours per day. These restaurants typically do not take
reservations. Patrons commonly wait to be seated, are served by a waiter/waitress, order from
menus and pay tor their mea! after they eat. Some facilities contained within this land use may also
contain a bar area for serving food and alcoholic drinks. Quality restaurant (Land Use 931 ), fast-food
restaurant without drive-through window (Land Use 933). fast-food reslaurant w ith drive-through
window (Land Use 934) and fast-food restaurant with drive-through window and no Indoor seating
(Land Use 935) are related uses.


A dd itional Data

Users should exercise caution when applying statistics during the A.M. peak periods, as the
sites contained in the database for this land use may or may not be open for breakfast. In
cases where It was conflrmed that the sites were not open for breakfast, data for the A. M.
peak hour of the adjacent street traffic were removed from the database.

Information on approximate hourly variation in high-turnover (sit.Oown) restaurant traffic is shown in
the following table. It should be noted, however, that the information contained in this table is based
on a limited sample size. Therefore, caution should be exercised when applying the data. Also, some
information provided in the table may conflict with the results obtained by applying the average rate
or regression equations. When this occurs, It Is suggested that t.he results from the average rate or
regression equations be used, as they are based on a larger number of studies.

       Vehicle occupancy ranged from 1.39 to 1.69 persons per automobile on an average weekday.
       The average for the sites surveyed was approximately 1.52.

       Five sites submitted for inclusion in this land use indicated the presence of an on-site pick-up window. From
       the limited data sample, it does not appear that the presence of a pick-up window had a significant impact
       on trip generation.

       The outdoor seating area is not included in the overall gross floor area. Therefore, the number of seats
       may be a more reliable independent variable on which to establish trip generation rates for facilities having
       significant outdoor seating .

       The sites were surveyed between the 1960s and the 2000s throughout the United States.

    Re:      'fhorngate Owners Association

    Dear Mayor Kaplan, Mayor Rosenthal and Ms. Maine:

    As the attorneys for the Thorngate Owners Association, we have been requested to contact you with
    regard to the proposed restaurant to be opened at the corner of Saunders Road and Deerfield Road.

    Please be adv.'ised, the Board of Directors for the Thorngate Homeowners Association is in opposition of
    this modification to this property. The Board believes that it will have a serious adverse impact on the
    traffic in this area, as it will lead to severe congestion and could create a safety hazard for the occupants
    using the roads. As you are aware, there is a severe back-up on Deerfield Road during rush hour, and a
    restaurant will lead to greater congestion. In addition, th{l residents fear that there will not be enough
    parking, causing further traffic problems at this already busy io.t(1rsection.

    Based on the above, the Board requests that the Village of Riverwoods deny this request. If you should
    have any questions please contact us.

    Sincerely,         ( /

                               RECOMMENDATION


TO:          Mayor and Board of Trustees

FROM:        Board of Zoning Appeals

DATE:        May 7, 2013


SUBJECT: Front Yard, Side Yard and Parking Variation
         780 Saunders Rd. (Health O Wealth Inc.)

We transmit for your consideration recommendations adopted by the Deerfield Board of
Zoning Appeals on the petition of Health O Wealth Inc., 780 Saunders Rd. Deerfield,
Illinois. The petitioner seeks variations: (1) to reduce the minimum 50 foot front yard
setback to 25 feet (5.02-F,3,a) and (2) to reduce the side yard setback from a minimum of
12 feet to 7 feet (5.02-f,3,b) and (3) to reduce the required number of parking spaces from
35 spaces to 33 spaces (8.02-E,2,i) of the Deerfield Zoning Ordinance, to allow for the
construction, of a new restaurant on the subject property as depicted in the plans provided.

FINDINGS OF FACT

          1. The subject lot of record is zoned R-1 (Single Family Residential) and is
             currently in the Plan Commission process to be rezoned to C-2 (Outlying
             Commercial).

          2. The subject property was annexed into the Village September 14, 1994.

          3. The subject property was developed as a single family residence prior to
             annexation.

          4. The petitioner's variation requests are driven by the need to configure the site
             to accommodate the location of the new restaurant building and parking in the
             most efficient configuration on a unique site.

          5. The parcel is not part of the Parkway North Development but is contiguous to
             the Parkway North walking path on two sides.

CONCLUSIONS

          1. The requested relief from the strict interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance
             would not alter the proposed use of the property.

          2. The variations if granted would enhance public safety and improve internal
             traffic flow.

          3. The requested variations conform to the standards for variation, enumerated
             in Section 13.07-E of the Deerfield Zoning Ordinance.

          4. The variations requested, if granted will permit the parcel to be developed as
             designed, allowing the beneficial use of the land by the petitioner.

Minutes of Public Hearing                                                   May 7, 2013

A Deerfield Board of Zoning Appeals held a Public Hearing on Tuesday May 7, 2013 at
7:30 p.m. at the Village Hall Conference Room, 850 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, Illinois.
Chairman Robert Speckmann called the meeting to order at 7:30 p.m.

Ch. Speckmann indicated the Board of Zoning Appeals is advisory to the Mayor and
Board of Trustees. He explained the BZA's deliberations and recommendations would
be in front of the Trustees at their June 3, 2013 meeting. Ch. Speckmann requested the
petitioners appear at that meeting to answer any questions the Trustees may have.

Present were:
Chairman Bob Speckmann
Len Adams
Karen Bezman
Herb Kessel
Ted Kuczek (left at 8:30 pm)
Karen Scott

Absent was:
Jeff Auerbach

Also Present:
Clint Case, Enforcement Officer
Jeff Hansen, Assistant Code Enforcement Officer

Mr. Hansen confirmed the mailings were in order and the Public Hearing was properly
advertised and listed. Ch. Speckmann swore in the petitioners for both petitions and
opened the Public Hearing.

The first petition is seeking a rear yard setback variation. The petitioners, Kevin and
Claudine Harig, own the property commonly known as 260 Deerfield Road, Deerfield,
Illinois 60015. Mr. Harig indicated they propose correcting the north (rear) setback on
the lot line to reflect the existing structure. When the lot was subdivided in 1968, the
setback and structure were not taken into consideration and there is a required 50 foot
setback. They would like to have the setback corrected to make their existing house
conformant.

Ch. Speckmann noted this is a housekeeping issue, as it was not addressed in 1968
when the lot was subdivided. They did not create a rear yard that was conforming, so
the lot is not conforming at this time.

Mrs. Harig explained the issue was found as they went through the permit process.
They are looking to build out their property with an addition. Mrs. Harig indicated they
propose upgrading the electrical and plumbing as well.

Ms. Scott questioned the garage reconstruction. Ms. Harig explained the garage walls
would be torn down to allow for a roof extension, but would be reconstructed in the
same area. The garage would remain a detached garage.

Ch. Speckmann noted that the legal notice requested a rear yard of 44.44 feet, but the
documentation indicated a rear yard of 43.6 feet. He believes that would put a bend in
the back wall of the addtion. In order to create an addition with a straight wall, Ch.
Speckmann believes the actual setback should be 43 feet to allow room if the
foundation does not line up properly. He suggested the petition be adjusted to allow a
variance of 43.00 feet.

Mr. Adams questioned whether the garage would be the same size, but the opening be
changed so it opens to the east side of the property. Ms. Harig explained the garage
would be enlarged slightly to the north and the roof would overhang to allow for a
walkway. He noted the petitioner currently accesses the garage from the west side.

Mr. Adams questioned whether that existing curb cut would be closed. Ms. Harig
explained they would add a curb cut next to the neighbor's curb cut. There was a legal
document between the two deeds stipulating the easement portion of the Harig's lot,
which has the adjacent curb cut, is only for the use of the adjacent property. It is not
allowed to be shared. Ms. Harig noted there is a document stating the easement is a
sole use easement

The variation if granted would permit a 43.00 foot rear yard setback variation.

Ch. Speckmann closed the information gathering portion of the Public Hearing.

Mr. Kessel made a motion to send a favorable recommendation to the Mayor and Board
of Trustees to grant the variation as presented and amended. Mr. Adams seconded the
motion. The motion passed unanimously.

Ch. Speckmann reopened the Public Hearing to consider a front yard setback variation
for the property located at 780 Saunders Road.

Brett Webster, architect and project manager representing the Abbots, owners of the
property commonly known as 780 Saunders Road, indicated the existing house and
freestanding sheds on the property that would be removed to create space for a
proposed restaurant.

Mr. Webster explained the proposed restaurant is a 3000 square foot structure with an
outdoor dining area along the south property line. The parking area will be on the rear
Board of Zoning Appeals
May 7, 2013
Page 3 of 7

of the site. The business will have a mix of carry-out and dine-in service. Mr. Webster
indicated the proposed restaurant features healthy dining with a zero-waste scheme.
The site has been designed for access from the office park. Patrons are also
encouraged to walk and use bicycles to access the restaurant. Ch. Speckmann asked if
an easement has been negotiated with the Parkway North office park. Mr. Webster
explained they are in process of negotiating an easement.

Ch. Speckmann asked why it is necessary to have the building closer to the street than
what is allowed in the Ordinance. Mr. Webster explained that they provided a letter
describing the requested variations along with the standards. The first standard, not a
use variation, is not applicable to the property because they are in process of requesting
a Zoning change with the Board of Trustees. The second standard is unique to the
property. Mr. Webster noted the parcel is currently zoned R-1 situated between an
office complex and the Village of Riverwoods. The parcel was not part of the large
office complex to the south and the east. Directly to the north of the parcel is a bank
with a parking lot and driveway access and then the Mobile station on the corner. The
result is this long, narrow parcel. The Comprehensive Plan recommended this property
have the same type of use as the office complex; however, the owners did not find a
way to comply as an office use. The reality of the parcel is that there is only so large of
a building that can fit on the parcel and allow for parking and landscaping. Mr. Webster
spoke with the planning staff that would prefer the parcel to be a tax-generating
business and zoned as outlying commercial. The Abbots, who operate the Mobile gas
station on the corner of Deerfield and Riverwoods Roads, believe a 3000 square foot
restaurant would be appropriate for the parcel.

Ch. Speckmann noted Lake County Department of Transportation is taking 10 feet of
property for a wider right-of-way, which if not done would result in a 35 foot setback
rather than a 25 foot setback. Mr. Webster noted that if the setback were place an
additional 25 feet from Saunders, the restaurant would have to be pushed back and the
building would have to be made smaller. Ch. Speckmann noted parking calculations,
building and plumbing codes differ for a 2000 square foot seating area (excluding the
back house area.) The current building regulations would allow one person per 15
square feet of area. Ch. Speckmann expressed concern because there would only be
50 people in a space large enough for 130. Mr. Webster explained there would include
a mix of a sit-down restaurant and selling of packaged food. Ch. Speckmann explained
the maximum number of patrons would be 50. He believes the space will seem very
empty. Ch. Speckmann questioned why the restaurant needs this much space, as the
fire department will issue a maximum occupancy. He indicated the petitioner may not
need as many variances if the restaurant size were reduced. He suggested the
petitioners look at the design and determine whether or not they really need that much
space.

Mr. Abbott explained most of their customers will be from the office complexes during
lunch and food delivery will be made available. Mr. Abbott noted they need the space
because they will be offering gluten free options which need to be prepared separately.

Ch. Speckmann noted the current floor plan does not allow adequate space for the
entire back of house area as just described. He believes reducing the dining room size
would make the petition more appropriate. Mr. Webster explained the proposed interior
layout was a preliminary scheme. Mr. Abbott would prefer to have more room to
accommodate patrons. He also indicated the employees would park at the Mobile
station. In addition, they are in discussion with the bank regarding additional parking.

Mr. Webster explained attaining a 50 foot front yard setback would be difficult to
achieve. The owners requested a variation that would allow the most flexibility to have
a long-lasting, thriving business on the parcel.

Mr. Kessel asked about the pedestrian traffic flow and the path along the eastern edge
of the property. Mr. Webster showed the path on the Parkway North property that
continues around the building. He noted there are two entrances into the restaurant,
one in the front and one in the rear.

Ch. Speckmann closed the information gathering portion of the Public Hearing. Mr.
Kessel questioned whether the Village could live with a 50% variation. Ch. Speckmann
explained the Lake County Department of Transportation is taking 10 feet, so he does
not have an issue with this variation.

Mr. Adams made a motion to send a favorable recommendation to the Board of
Trustees regarding the portion of the petition regarding the front yard setback variation.
Ms. Scott seconded the motion. The motion passed by the following vote:

AYES: Kuczek, Scott, Adams, Bezman, Speckmann (5)
NAYS: Kessel (1)

Ch. Speckmann reopened the Public Hearing to consider the south side yard setback
variation of seven feet for the property located at 780 Saunders Road. He assumed the
deck would be a raised deck rather than a patio. If it is a patio, the variation request
would not be necessary. Mr. Webster noted there would be steel columns extending
higher than the building roof. There will be a sunscreen and a vertical garden. Ch.
Speckmann indicated the raised deck must have a variation. Mr. Webster noted it is not
a raised deck, but it would be enclosed with a transparent structure. Code Enforcement
Officer Case indicated that if the structure has columns, it would need to be reviewed.

Ch. Speckmann indicated he neglected to ask for public comment during the front yard
setback variation request. He asked if there were any comments.

David Schreiber, 464 Pebble Beach Lane, Riverwoods, is president of the Thorngate
Homeowners Association. Thorngate is located across the street of the property, in
Riverwoods. Mr. Schreiber indicated they are against moving the building closer to the
road. Mr. Schreiber expressed concern about the lighting that will shine in the bedroom
windows of their homeowners. In addition, they feel allowing vehicles to turn
Board of Zoning Appeals
May 7, 2013
Page 5 of 7

southbound onto Saunders Road will create a safety hazard. The Thorngate
Homeowner's Association requested only allowing vehicles to enter the property from
the south and exit the property going north. Trying to cut across traffic will create a
problem. Ch. Speckmann indicated Mr. Schreiber's request is outside the scope of the
Board of Zoning Appeals. He noted the Plan Commission already heard this request
and rejected it. Ch. Speckmann suggested Mr. Schreiber appear before the Mayor and
Board of Trustees.

Mr. Adams noted the lighting is typically in the parking area, which is located in the rear
of the restaurant. Mr. Schreiber noted that the ambient lighting would also disturb their
homeowners. Ch. Speckmann indicated that this is also outside the Board of Zoning
Appeals jurisdiction. Ms. Bezman noted the gas station lighting is brighter than
whatever lighting the restaurant would have. Mr. Schreiber explained the Abbotts have
changed the bulbs to make them less visible from Thorngate. He noted that if the
building were further set back, it would not make a difference to the residents of
Thorngate.

Mr. Kuczek made a motion to send a favorable recommendation to the Board of
Trustees regarding the portion of the petition regarding the front yard setback variation.
Mr. Kessel seconded the motion. The motion passed 5-1 with Mr. Kessel voting against
the petition.

Ch. Speckmann asked if there were any questions regarding the side yard setback
variation request. Mr. Kessel questioned what is to the south of the proposed
development. Mr. Webster explained it is an empty pad that is ready for an office
building that is pre-approved for a PUD. It is located on John Buck's property. Ch.
Speckmann spoke with Village Planner Jeff Ryckaert, who indicated that property
requires a 300 foot setback.

Mr. Adams noted the proposed outdoor deck seating would be according to the Plan
Commission recommendation and would not count against the parking requirement.
Ch. Speckmann indicated that was the recommendation of the Plan Commission. Mr.
Adams explained the proposed outdoor structure is somewhat permanent and it would
not be too difficult to further enclose the structure so it is available more than three
months a year. One of the requirements is to make the variations the minimum
necessary. Mr. Adams does not believe the proposed side yard variation represents the
minimum necessary. He believes the outdoor seating area, which was previously
described as not as important, could be made smaller. Mr. Case explained the required
side yard setback is 12 feet. They are requesting a five foot variation. Mr. Abbott
explained they are asking for the variation because they want to grow fresh vegetables
in that area as well. Mr. Webster added that the outdoor area is not solely for dining.
Although the design is not fully developed, they intend to grow plants on the vertical
screen. They also propose adding integral planting boxes and bicycle stands. Mr.
Webster noted the roof is not enclosed and the vertical wall has a horizontal canopy.
The east and west areas of the structure are open. The fresh vegetables will be used in

the restaurant. Mr. Webster noted that if the outdoor area were made narrower, it would
negatively impact the long-term success of the business. Mr. Adams indicated the
property could have many lives; however, what would happen if the property were sold.
Ch. Speckmann noted that if the business were sold, the building would remain with the
setback variations. The new business could enclose the structure or add more tables.
Ch. Speckmann noted the Village Ordinances are currently written for specific
businesses. Mr. Kessel does not believe an Ordinance could be passed specifically for
this ownership. Mr. Case explained that any restaurant would be considered a Special
Use. If the design were modified, the Special Use would need to be amended as well.
Mr. Adams believes the front yard is the minimum necessary, but the proposed side
yard is not the minimum necessary.

Ch. Speckmann asked the public if they have comments.

Jill Finch, 771 Congressional Lane, expressed concern about noise. She does not
understand why there needs to be outdoor seating until 10:00 PM. She also needs to
deal with noise from Waste Management at 5:00 AM. Ms. Finch is concerned about the
noise from food truck deliveries and additional garbage pickup. She wants to ensure
she has a commitment from the owners that their business operations will not impact
her quality of life. Ch. Speckmann closed this portion of the Public Hearing.

Mr. Kessel made a motion to send a favorable recommendation to the Mayor and Board
of Trustees regarding the portion of the petition allowing a seven foot side yard setback
in lieu of a 12 foot side yard setback. Ms. Scott seconded the motion. The motion
passed by the following vote:

AYES: Scott, Kessel, Bezman, Speckmann (4)
NAYS: Adams (1)

Ch. Speckmann reopened the information gathering portion of the Public Hearing to
consider the proposed minimum parking requirement variation. He explained the
number of vehicles was determined because the business includes both sit-down and
carry out services. The calculation determined 35 spaces including two handicapped
spaces would be required for the site. The proposed plan includes 33 spaces including
the two handicapped spaces. The parking includes both employee and public parking.
Ch. Speckmann indicated the more space that is used as back of the house space, the
less parking that is actually needed. Mr. Kessel noted that the proposed restaurant
could have 4000 square feet of seating, but only requires 35 parking spaces. Ch.
Speckmann explained that based on 40% of their business being sit-down, the
Ordinance requires 35 parking spaces. With 3000 square feet of area, 20 spaces would
be required. The carry out requires 15 spaces. Ch. Speckmann believes that if the
restaurant becomes a viable entity, there will not be enough parking. The petitioner is
requesting a variation of two parking spaces. Mr. Adams indicated the Board of
Trustees needs to determine whether this is a viable entity. The Board has the
discretion to count the outdoor seating.

Ch. Speckmann closed the informational gathering portion of the Public Hearing. Mr.
Adams made a motion to send a favorable recommendation to the Mayor and Board of
Trustees on the sole question of whether to grant a parking variance of two spaces.
Ms. Scott seconded the motion. The motion passed unanimously.

Ch. Speckmann urged the petitioner to provide a more in depth layout of the building for
review by the Mayor and Board of Trustees.


Adjournment:

There being no further business or discussion, the meeting was adjourned at 8:55 pm.

                                                                       Deerfield, IL

          Description of variations:

                 A proposed Front Yard setback of 25 feet in lieu of the required setback of 50 feet in the C-2 Outlying
                 Commercial District

                 A proposed Side Yard setback (along the South property line) of 7 feet in lieu of the required setback of
                 12 feet in the C-2 Outlying Commercial District

                 Proposed 33 stall parking lot in lieu of the required 35 stall parking lot.

          Applicable Standards:

                 1.     Not a Use Variation

                        A Special Use for a Restaurant larger than 3,000 sq. ft. inclusive of outdoor dining is being
                        requested of the Plan Commission and Village Board at a Public Hearing scheduled for April 11,
                        2013.

                 2.     Unique to the Property

                        This is a residential property proposed to be Re-zoned to C-2 Outlying Commercial. The
                        property is unique in that it is at the Northwest corner of the Village adjacent to a large 1-1
                        Zoning district comprised primarily of office buildings on much larger parcels of land. The
                        property size is long, narrow and has direct access to only one right-of-way along the West
                        property line. These circumstances limit the possibilities of building size and parking lot layout.

                 3.     Not Self Imposed

                        This is a residential property proposed in the Village Comprehensive Plan to be an
                        Office/Research use. The North/South dimension of the property limits the building size and
                        parking lot layout for any type of use proposed for this property.

                 4.     Not Exclusively Monetary

                        The beneficial use of this property is restricted by the physical size which limits the possible
                        configurations of a building and a parking lot that fully comply with all provisions of the Zoning
                        Ordinance. The enclosed vehicle turning diagrams illustrate the turning clearance required at
                        the Northeast corner of the site. The striped area indicates the location of the parking stall
                        variation.

              5.   Minimum Adjustment Necessary

                   The variations being requested are the minimum necessary to locate a building and parking lot
                   for a commercial restaurant capable of serving customers in a comfortable and efficient
                   environment.

              6.   Not Detrimental to the Public Welfare

                   The variations being requested are minor deviations from the general purpose and intent of the
                   Zoning Ordinance. The development of the property as proposed will provide a needed use in
                   the neighborhood and add to the character of the neighborhood. The variations requested will
                   not be detrimental to the public welfare, other property, nor shall it alter the essential character
                   of the neighborhood.

              7.   Not Detrimental to the Neighborhood

                   The variations being requested will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to the adjacent
                   properties as adequate setbacks have been provided. The development of the property as
                   proposed will not create congestion in the streets as adequate parking has been provided for
                   the proposed restaurant use. The variations requested will not increase the potential damage of
                   fire or endanger the public safety. The building will be constructed to comply with the current
                   building codes enforced by the Village.

    Re:      'fhorngate Owners Association

    Dear Mayor Kaplan, Mayor Rosenthal and Ms. Maine:

    As the attorneys for the Thorngate Owners Association, we have been requested to contact you with
    regard to the proposed restaurant to be opened at the corner of Saunders Road and Deerfield Road.

    Please be adv.'ised, the Board of Directors for the Thorngate Homeowners Association is in opposition of
    this modification to this property. The Board believes that it will have a serious adverse impact on the
    traffic in this area, as it will lead to severe congestion and could create a safety hazard for the occupants
    using the roads. As you are aware, there is a severe back-up on Deerfield Road during rush hour, and a
    restaurant will lead to greater congestion. In addition, th{l residents fear that there will not be enough
    parking, causing further traffic problems at this already busy io.t(1rsection.

    Based on the above, the Board requests that the Village of Riverwoods deny this request. If you should
    have any questions please contact us.

    Sincerely,         ( /

SUBJECT:      Report and Recommendation of the Board of Zoning Appeals
RE: Request of Kevin and Claudine Harig of 260 Deerfield Road, Deerfield,
Illinois, for relief from Article 4.01-F, Paragraph 3, Subparagraph e, of the
Deerfield Zoning Ordinance for their property at 260 Deerfield Road. The
variation if granted would permit the construction of a two story addition,
extending 7.0 feet into the required 50 foot minimum rear yard specified by the
Zoning Ordinance.

Action Requested: Acceptance of the BZA Recommendation_____________

Originated By: Board of Zoning Appeals______________________________

Referred To: Mayor and Board of Trustees____________________________

Summary of Background and Reason for Request:

A public hearing was held on May 7, 2013 to consider the requests of the
petitioners for a two story addition encroaching 7.0 feet into the required rear
yard producing a 43.0 foot rear yard in lieu of the minimum 50 feet.

The Gursoy subdivision created an existing non-conformity of the rear yard
setback on the north of the property. The granting of the petitioners request
would validate the existing nonconforming setback. In addition, there were no
objections to the request from nearby property owners.


Therefore, on a motion to recommend the variation be granted, the vote was 5 to
0 in favor of the request.

TO:              Mayor and Board of Trustees

FROM:            Board of Zoning Appeals

DATE:            May 7, 2013

SUBJECT:         Rear Yard Variation- 260 Deerfield Road


We transmit for your consideration a recommendation adopted by the
Deerfield Board of Zoning Appeals on the petition of Kevin and Claudine
Harig, 260 Deerfield Road, Deerfield, Illinois. The petitioner is seeking relief
from Article 4.01-F, Paragraph 3, Subparagraph e, of the Deerfield Zoning
Ordinance for their property at 260 Deerfield Road. The variation if granted
would permit the construction of a two story addition to the existing
nonconforming structure created during the Gursoy subdivision process in
1968. The variation if granted would validate a 44.25 foot rear yard where the
existing structure would remain per the original subdivision in lieu of the
required 50 foot rear yard specified in the zoning ordinance.


FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The subject property is zoned in an R-1 district.

2. The Gursoy Subdivision was legally created in 1968.

3. The original structure was established prior to the subdivision and zoning
   ordinances being in effect.

4. The proposed addition will encroach 7.0 feet into the required 50 foot rear
   yard where the existing structure will remain.

5. The rear yard of the subject property abuts the property to the North which
   is part of the Gorsoy subdivision.

         CONCLUSIONS

         1. The requested variation is not a use variation.

         2. The existing non-conformity of the structure on the lot was created by the
            legal subdivision in 1968.

         3. The granting of the petitioners' request would validate the existing
            encroachment into the rear yard.

         4. There were no objections to the petitioners' request from nearby property
            owners.


         MOTIONS AND VOTE

         The motion was made to recommend the petitioners' request be granted:

         AYES: (5) Kessel, Kuczek, Moyer, Robbins, Scott, Speckmann

         NYES: (0)

         Motion Passed.

         RECOMMENDATION

         Accordingly, in the presence of 5 concurring votes, the Board of Zoning
         Appeals recommends the requested variation be granted to permit the
         construction of a two story addition, which would encroach 7.0 feet into the
         minimum rear yard, leaving a rear yard of 43.0 feet in lieu of the minimum 50
         feet required 50 foot.


         Respectfully submitted,

         Robert Speckmann, Chairman
         Deerfield Board of Zoning Appeals

Minutes of Public Hearing                                                   May 7, 2013

A Deerfield Board of Zoning Appeals held a Public Hearing on Tuesday May 7, 2013 at
7:30 p.m. at the Village Hall Conference Room, 850 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, Illinois.
Chairman Robert Speckmann called the meeting to order at 7:30 p.m.

Ch. Speckmann indicated the Board of Zoning Appeals is advisory to the Mayor and
Board of Trustees. He explained the BZA's deliberations and recommendations would
be in front of the Trustees at their June 3, 2013 meeting. Ch. Speckmann requested the
petitioners appear at that meeting to answer any questions the Trustees may have.

Present were:
Chairman Bob Speckmann
Len Adams
Karen Bezman
Herb Kessel
Ted Kuczek (left at 8:30 pm)
Karen Scott

Absent was:
Jeff Auerbach

Also Present:
Clint Case, Enforcement Officer
Jeff Hansen, Assistant Code Enforcement Officer

Mr. Hansen confirmed the mailings were in order and the Public Hearing was properly
advertised and listed. Ch. Speckmann swore in the petitioners for both petitions and
opened the Public Hearing.

The first petition is seeking a rear yard setback variation. The petitioners, Kevin and
Claudine Harig, own the property commonly known as 260 Deerfield Road, Deerfield,
Illinois 60015. Mr. Harig indicated they propose correcting the north (rear) setback on
the lot line to reflect the existing structure. When the lot was subdivided in 1968, the
setback and structure were not taken into consideration and there is a required 50 foot
setback. They would like to have the setback corrected to make their existing house
conformant.

Ch. Speckmann noted this is a housekeeping issue, as it was not addressed in 1968
when the lot was subdivided. They did not create a rear yard that was conforming, so
the lot is not conforming at this time.

Mrs. Harig explained the issue was found as they went through the permit process.
They are looking to build out their property with an addition. Mrs. Harig indicated they
propose upgrading the electrical and plumbing as well.

Ms. Scott questioned the garage reconstruction. Ms. Harig explained the garage walls
would be torn down to allow for a roof extension, but would be reconstructed in the
same area. The garage would remain a detached garage.

Ch. Speckmann noted that the legal notice requested a rear yard of 44.44 feet, but the
documentation indicated a rear yard of 43.6 feet. He believes that would put a bend in
the back wall of the addtion. In order to create an addition with a straight wall, Ch.
Speckmann believes the actual setback should be 43 feet to allow room if the
foundation does not line up properly. He suggested the petition be adjusted to allow a
variance of 43.00 feet.

Mr. Adams questioned whether the garage would be the same size, but the opening be
changed so it opens to the east side of the property. Ms. Harig explained the garage
would be enlarged slightly to the north and the roof would overhang to allow for a
walkway. He noted the petitioner currently accesses the garage from the west side.

Mr. Adams questioned whether that existing curb cut would be closed. Ms. Harig
explained they would add a curb cut next to the neighbor's curb cut. There was a legal
document between the two deeds stipulating the easement portion of the Harig's lot,
which has the adjacent curb cut, is only for the use of the adjacent property. It is not
allowed to be shared. Ms. Harig noted there is a document stating the easement is a
sole use easement

The variation if granted would permit a 43.00 foot rear yard setback variation.

Ch. Speckmann closed the information gathering portion of the Public Hearing.

Mr. Kessel made a motion to send a favorable recommendation to the Mayor and Board
of Trustees to grant the variation as presented and amended. Mr. Adams seconded the
motion. The motion passed unanimously.

Ch. Speckmann reopened the Public Hearing to consider a front yard setback variation
for the property located at 780 Saunders Road.

Brett Webster, architect and project manager representing the Abbots, owners of the
property commonly known as 780 Saunders Road, indicated the existing house and
freestanding sheds on the property that would be removed to create space for a
proposed restaurant.

Mr. Webster explained the proposed restaurant is a 3000 square foot structure with an
outdoor dining area along the south property line. The parking area will be on the rear
Board of Zoning Appeals

of the site. The business will have a mix of carry-out and dine-in service. Mr. Webster
indicated the proposed restaurant features healthy dining with a zero-waste scheme.
The site has been designed for access from the office park. Patrons are also
encouraged to walk and use bicycles to access the restaurant. Ch. Speckmann asked if
an easement has been negotiated with the Parkway North office park. Mr. Webster
explained they are in process of negotiating an easement.

Ch. Speckmann asked why it is necessary to have the building closer to the street than
what is allowed in the Ordinance. Mr. Webster explained that they provided a letter
describing the requested variations along with the standards. The first standard, not a
use variation, is not applicable to the property because they are in process of requesting
a Zoning change with the Board of Trustees. The second standard is unique to the
property. Mr. Webster noted the parcel is currently zoned R-1 situated between an
office complex and the Village of Riverwoods. The parcel was not part of the large
office complex to the south and the east. Directly to the north of the parcel is a bank
with a parking lot and driveway access and then the Mobile station on the corner. The
result is this long, narrow parcel. The Comprehensive Plan recommended this property
have the same type of use as the office complex; however, the owners did not find a
way to comply as an office use. The reality of the parcel is that there is only so large of
a building that can fit on the parcel and allow for parking and landscaping. Mr. Webster
spoke with the planning staff that would prefer the parcel to be a tax-generating
business and zoned as outlying commercial. The Abbots, who operate the Mobile gas
station on the corner of Deerfield and Riverwoods Roads, believe a 3000 square foot
restaurant would be appropriate for the parcel.

Ch. Speckmann noted Lake County Department of Transportation is taking 10 feet of
property for a wider right-of-way, which if not done would result in a 35 foot setback
rather than a 25 foot setback. Mr. Webster noted that if the setback were place an
additional 25 feet from Saunders, the restaurant would have to be pushed back and the
building would have to be made smaller. Ch. Speckmann noted parking calculations,
building and plumbing codes differ for a 2000 square foot seating area (excluding the
back house area.) The current building regulations would allow one person per 15
square feet of area. Ch. Speckmann expressed concern because there would only be
50 people in a space large enough for 130. Mr. Webster explained there would include
a mix of a sit-down restaurant and selling of packaged food. Ch. Speckmann explained
the maximum number of patrons would be 50. He believes the space will seem very
empty. Ch. Speckmann questioned why the restaurant needs this much space, as the
fire department will issue a maximum occupancy. He indicated the petitioner may not
need as many variances if the restaurant size were reduced. He suggested the
petitioners look at the design and determine whether or not they really need that much
space.

Mr. Abbott explained most of their customers will be from the office complexes during
lunch and food delivery will be made available. Mr. Abbott noted they need the space
because they will be offering gluten free options which need to be prepared separately.

Ch. Speckmann noted the current floor plan does not allow adequate space for the
entire back of house area as just described. He believes reducing the dining room size
would make the petition more appropriate. Mr. Webster explained the proposed interior
layout was a preliminary scheme. Mr. Abbott would prefer to have more room to
accommodate patrons. He also indicated the employees would park at the Mobile
station. In addition, they are in discussion with the bank regarding additional parking.

Mr. Webster explained attaining a 50 foot front yard setback would be difficult to
achieve. The owners requested a variation that would allow the most flexibility to have
a long-lasting, thriving business on the parcel.

Mr. Kessel asked about the pedestrian traffic flow and the path along the eastern edge
of the property. Mr. Webster showed the path on the Parkway North property that
continues around the building. He noted there are two entrances into the restaurant,
one in the front and one in the rear.

Ch. Speckmann closed the information gathering portion of the Public Hearing. Mr.
Kessel questioned whether the Village could live with a 50% variation. Ch. Speckmann
explained the Lake County Department of Transportation is taking 10 feet, so he does
not have an issue with this variation.

Mr. Adams made a motion to send a favorable recommendation to the Board of
Trustees regarding the portion of the petition regarding the front yard setback variation.
Ms. Scott seconded the motion. The motion passed by the following vote:

AYES: Kuczek, Scott, Adams, Bezman, Speckmann (5)
NAYS: Kessel (1)

Ch. Speckmann reopened the Public Hearing to consider the south side yard setback
variation of seven feet for the property located at 780 Saunders Road. He assumed the
deck would be a raised deck rather than a patio. If it is a patio, the variation request
would not be necessary. Mr. Webster noted there would be steel columns extending
higher than the building roof. There will be a sunscreen and a vertical garden. Ch.
Speckmann indicated the raised deck must have a variation. Mr. Webster noted it is not
a raised deck, but it would be enclosed with a transparent structure. Code Enforcement
Officer Case indicated that if the structure has columns, it would need to be reviewed.

Ch. Speckmann indicated he neglected to ask for public comment during the front yard
setback variation request. He asked if there were any comments.

David Schreiber, 464 Pebble Beach Lane, Riverwoods, is president of the Thorngate
Homeowners Association. Thorngate is located across the street of the property, in
Riverwoods. Mr. Schreiber indicated they are against moving the building closer to the
road. Mr. Schreiber expressed concern about the lighting that will shine in the bedroom
windows of their homeowners. In addition, they feel allowing vehicles to turn
Board of Zoning Appeals
May 7, 2013

southbound onto Saunders Road will create a safety hazard. The Thorngate
Homeowner's Association requested only allowing vehicles to enter the property from
the south and exit the property going north. Trying to cut across traffic will create a
problem. Ch. Speckmann indicated Mr. Schreiber's request is outside the scope of the
Board of Zoning Appeals. He noted the Plan Commission already heard this request
and rejected it. Ch. Speckmann suggested Mr. Schreiber appear before the Mayor and
Board of Trustees.

Mr. Adams noted the lighting is typically in the parking area, which is located in the rear
of the restaurant. Mr. Schreiber noted that the ambient lighting would also disturb their
homeowners. Ch. Speckmann indicated that this is also outside the Board of Zoning
Appeals jurisdiction. Ms. Bezman noted the gas station lighting is brighter than
whatever lighting the restaurant would have. Mr. Schreiber explained the Abbotts have
changed the bulbs to make them less visible from Thorngate. He noted that if the
building were further set back, it would not make a difference to the residents of
Thorngate.

Mr. Kuczek made a motion to send a favorable recommendation to the Board of
Trustees regarding the portion of the petition regarding the front yard setback variation.
Mr. Kessel seconded the motion. The motion passed 5-1 with Mr. Kessel voting against
the petition.

Ch. Speckmann asked if there were any questions regarding the side yard setback
variation request. Mr. Kessel questioned what is to the south of the proposed
development. Mr. Webster explained it is an empty pad that is ready for an office
building that is pre-approved for a PUD. It is located on John Buck's property. Ch.
Speckmann spoke with Village Planner Jeff Ryckaert, who indicated that property
requires a 300 foot setback.

Mr. Adams noted the proposed outdoor deck seating would be according to the Plan
Commission recommendation and would not count against the parking requirement.
Ch. Speckmann indicated that was the recommendation of the Plan Commission. Mr.
Adams explained the proposed outdoor structure is somewhat permanent and it would
not be too difficult to further enclose the structure so it is available more than three
months a year. One of the requirements is to make the variations the minimum
necessary. Mr. Adams does not believe the proposed side yard variation represents the
minimum necessary. He believes the outdoor seating area, which was previously
described as not as important, could be made smaller. Mr. Case explained the required
side yard setback is 12 feet. They are requesting a five foot variation. Mr. Abbott
explained they are asking for the variation because they want to grow fresh vegetables
in that area as well. Mr. Webster added that the outdoor area is not solely for dining.
Although the design is not fully developed, they intend to grow plants on the vertical
screen. They also propose adding integral planting boxes and bicycle stands. Mr.
Webster noted the roof is not enclosed and the vertical wall has a horizontal canopy.
The east and west areas of the structure are open. The fresh vegetables will be used in
Board of Zoning Appeals

the restaurant. Mr. Webster noted that if the outdoor area were made narrower, it would
negatively impact the long-term success of the business. Mr. Adams indicated the
property could have many lives; however, what would happen if the property were sold.
Ch. Speckmann noted that if the business were sold, the building would remain with the
setback variations. The new business could enclose the structure or add more tables.
Ch. Speckmann noted the Village Ordinances are currently written for specific
businesses. Mr. Kessel does not believe an Ordinance could be passed specifically for
this ownership. Mr. Case explained that any restaurant would be considered a Special
Use. If the design were modified, the Special Use would need to be amended as well.
Mr. Adams believes the front yard is the minimum necessary, but the proposed side
yard is not the minimum necessary.

Ch. Speckmann asked the public if they have comments.

Jill Finch, 771 Congressional Lane, expressed concern about noise. She does not
understand why there needs to be outdoor seating until 10:00 PM. She also needs to
deal with noise from Waste Management at 5:00 AM. Ms. Finch is concerned about the
noise from food truck deliveries and additional garbage pickup. She wants to ensure
she has a commitment from the owners that their business operations will not impact
her quality of life. Ch. Speckmann closed this portion of the Public Hearing.

Mr. Kessel made a motion to send a favorable recommendation to the Mayor and Board
of Trustees regarding the portion of the petition allowing a seven foot side yard setback
in lieu of a 12 foot side yard setback. Ms. Scott seconded the motion. The motion
passed by the following vote:

AYES: Scott, Kessel, Bezman, Speckmann (4)
NAYS: Adams (1)

Ch. Speckmann reopened the information gathering portion of the Public Hearing to
consider the proposed minimum parking requirement variation. He explained the
number of vehicles was determined because the business includes both sit-down and
carry out services. The calculation determined 35 spaces including two handicapped
spaces would be required for the site. The proposed plan includes 33 spaces including
the two handicapped spaces. The parking includes both employee and public parking.
Ch. Speckmann indicated the more space that is used as back of the house space, the
less parking that is actually needed. Mr. Kessel noted that the proposed restaurant
could have 4000 square feet of seating, but only requires 35 parking spaces. Ch.
Speckmann explained that based on 40% of their business being sit-down, the
Ordinance requires 35 parking spaces. With 3000 square feet of area, 20 spaces would
be required. The carry out requires 15 spaces. Ch. Speckmann believes that if the
restaurant becomes a viable entity, there will not be enough parking. The petitioner is
requesting a variation of two parking spaces. Mr. Adams indicated the Board of
Trustees needs to determine whether this is a viable entity. The Board has the
discretion to count the outdoor seating.

Ch. Speckmann closed the informational gathering portion of the Public Hearing. Mr.
Adams made a motion to send a favorable recommendation to the Mayor and Board of
Trustees on the sole question of whether to grant a parking variance of two spaces.
Ms. Scott seconded the motion. The motion passed unanimously.

Ch. Speckmann urged the petitioner to provide a more in depth layout of the building for
review by the Mayor and Board of Trustees.

There being no further business or discussion, the meeting was adjourned at 8:55 pm.

Subject:       Report and Recommendation regarding 2 Waukegan Road (Shell) request for Limited
               Area Groundwater Use Restriction Ordinance
Action Requested:     Accept Report and Recommendation
Originated By: Director of Public Works and Engineering
Referred To:    Mayor and Board of Trustees
Summary of Background and Reason for Request:
We have received a request from 2 Waukegan Road (Shell) to institute a Limited Area Groundwater Use
Restriction Ordinance (LGWO) that is specifically in accordance with the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency (IEPA) requirements. The Village of Deerfield Municipal Code requires that "No new
wells may be established and used for the supply of potable water in any area of the village". ((Ord. 0-99-
24, 5-3-1999) - Section 23-6A.).

The ownership of 2 Waukegan (Shell), True North Energy, LLC, recently submitted their executed
documents for this property and indicated their desire for the village to complete their process to approve
a LGWO. In April 2012 we requested authorization from the Board to retain the services of AECOM to
review and provide recommendations on this request. AECOM has now completed their evaluation (see
attachment). Their report states that they concur with the LGWO with the boundary as shown on Exhibit
A in the document. This would address potential and actual groundwater impacts. If approved by the
Board of Trustees, this ordinance will be submitted to the IEPA as part of the Site Remedial Action Plan.
We recommend that the Board accept the AECOM report and approve the LGWO for the subject
property.

Due to the fact that the Village has underground utilities within the potential contamination area we
requested the property owner and business to enter into a Supplemental Agreement with the Village. This
document was prepared by the Village of Deerfield Attorney. It outlines responsibilities of the owner/
business and the village, especially if the village needs to make an underground utility repair or
excavation. This agreement provides for ownership's reimbursement to the village for engineer and
attorney expenses. The Supplemental Agreement includes two attachments, a Highway Authority
Agreement and the LGWO. The Highway Authority Agreement also includes updated soil and
groundwater impact maps and analytical results. The agreement is attached and presented to you for your
review and approval.

We recommend that the Board accept the AECOM report and approve the Supplemental Agreement for 2
Waukegan Road (Shell), Deerfield, Illinois, including the Highway Authority Agreement and the Limited
Area Groundwater Use Restriction Ordinance.

Subject:    Summary Letter for
            Shell Station # 1917
            2 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, Illinois
            AECOM Project No. 60266708


Dear Ms. Little:

AECOM Technical Services, Inc. (AECOM) has prepared this summary letter of our review of
environmental documents associated with the above-referenced site. We understand that the
owner of the above referenced site is seeking closure for the site through the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency's (IEPA) Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Program. In order to
facilitate this closure they are requesting the Village of Deerfield (the Village) implement an
institutional control (groundwater use restriction ordinance) as further protection from the
environmental impacts associated with the site. The purpose of this review is to assess the
feasibility of site closure using institutional controls, including a groundwater ordinance.

AECOM reviewed environmental documents provided by the Village. These documents include the
following:

    1.   Corrective Action Plan, URS, dated May 16, 2013
    2.   Tiered Approach To Corrective-Action Objectives Supplemental Agreement
    3.   Highway Authority Agreement
    4.   Limited Area Groundwater Ordinance

Based on the review of the above documents, the gasoline station located at 2 Waukegan Road in
Deerfield, Illinois has experienced a release of unleaded gasoline that has impacted subsurface soil
and groundwater. Gasoline constituents including benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and xylenes
(BETX) and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) have been detected in the subsurface at the site. In
response to the release of gasoline, LUST incident # 20080899 was assigned to the site.

As part of the site closure, URS on behalf of True North Energy, LLC, is proposing to address the
gasoline impacts using institutional controls. The owner of the property will be required by the IEPA
to implement the institutional controls below to address these impacts. Except for the LGWO as
discussed below, approval of the following institutional controls is within the jurisdiction of the IEPA.
For purposes of this letter, AECOM has assumed that the IEPA will require compliance with all of
these items before issuing a No Further Remediation (NFR) letter.
AECOM                                        Summary Letter                                 Shell Station #1917              2
                                                                                            2 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, IL




The IEPA has established cleanup standards that need to be meet for both soil and groundwater
before a No Further Remediation (NFR) letter can be issued for the site. These standards are
provided in 35 Illinois Administrative Code (IAC) 742. There are three sets of Tier 1 standards; one
for residential properties, one for commercial/industrial properties and a third for potential
construction worker protection in case of future excavation work on the site. Each of the Tier 1
standards includes three sets of cleanup objectives for the different exposure routes; inhalation, soil
ingestion and groundwater ingestion. Initially the soil and groundwater concentrations are
compared to Tier 1 standards which are in look up tables. If any of the Tier 1 objective values are
exceeded then Tier 2 calculations can be performed.

Inhalation Exposure Route

Based on the URS report, benzene concentrations in on-site soil exceed the Tier 1 Residential soil
remedial objectives (SROs) in 35 IAC 742 for inhalation. The Tier 1 Construction Worker Inhalation
Exposure SROs have also been exceeded by the detected concentrations of benzene,
ethylbenzene and xylenes in the soil.

In order to further assess the inhalation exposure, URS conducted Tier 2 calculations using site
specific data. A comparison of the maximum concentrations detected to the Tier 2 SROs indicates
that the residential inhalation and construction inhalation SROs have been met. Based on the
comparison, institutional controls at the site are not required to address the inhalation exposure
route.

However, if the inhalation SRO exceedances extend off-site beneath Lake Cook Road, then the
proposed Highway Authority Agreement (HAA) would need to be implemented to obtain closure.
This would require the Cook County Highway Department as the "Highway Authority" to approve of
the proposed HAA. The IEPA will need to make a determination whether the HAA is required for
closure of the site.

Soil Ingestion Exposure Route

Based on the URS report BETX and MTBE concentrations in on-site soil are below the SROs for
soil ingestion. Therefore, no institutional controls are needed to address the soil ingestion
exposure route.

Groundwater Ingestion Exposure Route

           Soil Component of Groundwater Ingestion

The concentrations of benzene, ethylbenzene, xylenes and MTBE in the on-site soil exceed the Tier
1 Soil Component to Groundwater Ingestion SROs. URS calculated Tier 2 equations to
demonstrate the potential for these petroleum constituents to leach from the soil into the
groundwater. Based on the calculations the soil impacts could adversely impact the groundwater
beneath the site. However, additional calculations performed by URS indicated that the potential
groundwater impacts from the soil will attenuate before migrating off-site.

AECOM                                        Summary Letter                                 Shell Station #1917              3
                                                                                            2 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, IL




           Groundwater Component of Groundwater Ingestion

The detected groundwater concentrations of benzene and MTBE at the site have the potential to
migrate off-site before the impacts would dissipate to concentrations below the Class II
Groundwater Remedial Objectives.

AECOM has reviewed the proposed Limited Area Groundwater Use Restriction Ordinance (LGWO)
and concurs that LGWO would effectively address the petroleum groundwater impacts, if approved
by the IEPA. The proposed ordinance will need to meet the requirements from 35 IAC 742.1015.
In addition to the use of the LGWO, the IEPA will require written notifications to adjacent properties
within the area of use restriction, which could be potentially be impacted by the gasoline release.

General Closure Requirements

In order to exclude exposure routes utilizing the institutional controls above, 35 IAC 742.300
requires the following:

     1. A demonstration that the sum of the concentrations of all organic contaminants of concern
        do not exceed the attenuation capacity of the soil as determined under Section 742.215;

     2. A demonstration that the concentrations of any organic contaminants of concern remaining
        in the soil shall not exceed the soil saturation limit as determined under Section 742.220;

     3. A demonstration that the soil which contains contaminants of concern shall not exhibit any
        of the characteristics of reactivity for hazardous waste as determined under 35 Ill. Adm.
        Code 721.123;

Based on the URS report, these three exclusion criteria have been demonstrated.


AECOM appreciates the opportunity to provide consulting services for the Village of Deerfield.
Please feel free to contact the undersigned if you have questions regarding this letter.

Sincerely yours,




Steven T. Newlin                                                      Steve Kornder

             TIERED APPROACH TO CORRECTIVE-ACTION OBJECTIVES
                         SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT

      This Supplemental Agreement ("Supplemental Agreement") to establish obligations of
True North Energy LLC ("TN") is entered into this ___ day of _ _ , 2013, by and between
TN and the Village of Deerfield, Illinois ("Village"), as follows:

         I. The duly authorized representatives ofTN have signed this Supplemental Agreement.
This Supplemental Agreement is binding upon the parties, their successors and assigns upon
execution by the Village. This Supplemental Agreement shall be null and void if the Village
does not approve the attached Highway Authority Agreement ("HAA") [Attachment 1] or if the
Illinois Protection Agency ("IEPA") does not approve the Limited Area Groundwater Use
Restriction Ordinance ("LGWO") [Attachment 2] (as defined below) as an institutional control
for the Site and the closure of the Incident (as defined below).

       2.       TN is the owner and operator of the gasoline underground storage tanks and the
automobile service station facility located on the property commonly known as 2 Waukegan
Road, Deerfield, Illinois and legally described on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Site").

        3. TN is pursuing a corrective action of the Site and of the rights-of-way adjacent
thereto (the "Right-of-Way"), as depicted on Exhibit C to the HAA as set forth below.
"Corrective action" means the clean-up or removal of Contaminants (as defined in Paragraph 4
below) from soil or groundwater under an impermeable surface beneath the Right-of- Way
depicted on Exhibit C attached to the HAA, or within the area depicted in the LGWO, such that
the impacted soil or groundwater will be in compliance with Illinois Pollution Control Board
("IPCB") Tier II site specific standards pursuant to 35 Ill. Administrative Code Part 742 as
approved by the IEPA, or if such impacted soil or groundwater is not located under an IEP A
approved impermeable surface pursuant to an IEP A approved HAA, or within an IEP A approved
LGWO, will be in compliance with IPCB Tier I residential standards.

        4. Attached to the HAA as Group Exhibit B are tables prepared by TN showing the
concentration of contaminants of concern ("Contaminants") in soil and/or groundwater within
the Site, and which show the applicable Tier I soil remediation objectives for residential property
and Tier I objectives for groundwater of the Illinois Pollution Control Board ("lPCB"). Attached
to the BAA as Exhibit Cis a drawing prepared by TN which depicts the Right-of- Way and
which shows TN's maximum area of Contaminant impacted soil and/or groundwater where, at
the time of this Supplemental Agreement, Contaminants are estimated to exceed the Tier I
residential levels under 35 TIL Admin. Code Part 742. As the drawings in the Exhibits are not
surveyed plats, the boundary ofthe Right-of-Way in the Exhibits may be an approximation ofthe
actual Right-of- Way lines. It is impracticable to sample the Right-of- Way for Contaminants;
however, TN has represented to Village that the area of the Right-of- Way is adequate to
encompass soil and/or groundwater within the Right-of- Way possibly impacted with
Contaminants from a release at the Site.

      5. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency has assigned incident number
20080899 to the release at the Site ("Incident").


                                                1
        6. TN intends to request risk-based, site specific soil and/or groundwater remediation
objectives from the Illinois Environrnental Protection Agency ("IEPA") under 35 Ill. Admin.
Code Part 742.

         7. Under these rules, usc of risk-based, site specific remediation objectives in the Right-
of-Way may require the use of a Highway Authority Agreement as defined in 35 Ill. Admin.
Code Section 742.1020 and a Limited Area Groundwater Usc Restriction Ordinance as defined
in 35 Ill. Admin. Code Section 742.1015.

        8. The Village holds an easement for utility purposes in the Right-of-Way or some parts
of the Right--of- Way, or the Right-of-Way is a platted street, and has jurisdiction of such Right-
of-Way or parts thereof, or the Village now has or will install public utilities within the Right-of-
Way which may be under the jurisdiction of other governmental entities. For purposes of this
Supplemental Agreement, "jurisdiction" means that the Village exercises access control over the
use of groundwater beneath the Right-of-Way and the area depicted in the LGWO and over
access to the soil beneath the Right-of-Way because it requires a permit for that access or the
Village has public utilities within the Rights-of-Way which arc under the jurisdiction of other
governmental entities.

        9.      This Supplemental Agrcernent is intended to establish to the Village the
undertakings of TN for the purpose of providing the HAA and the LGWO in the form required
by the IPCB to the IEPA which establishes that the Village is willing to agree that it will not
allow the usc of groundwater within the LGWO depicted area and under the highway Rights-of-
Way which is under its jurisdiction as a potable or other domestic supply of water and that it will
limit access to soil under the Right-of- Way which is under its jurisdiction as described herein.

            10.  This Supplemental Agreement shall be null and void should the IEPA not approve
the BAA and/or the LGWO or should this Supplemental Agreement not be referenced in the "No
I::.'urther Remediation" determination; provided, however, that TN's agreement in Paragraph 12 to
defend and indemnify the Village and to reimburse the Village for certain costs shall not be null
and void.

       11.     The Village has agreed to certain obligations in the HAA as set forth in
paragraphs 6 through 12 of that document subject to the terms of this Supplemental Agreement.

         12.     TN agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Village, the Village's
officers, agents, contractors, permittees and employees, and other highway authorities, if any,
that own or have maintenance jurisdiction over the Right-of-Way or some parts of the Right-of-
Way by an agreernent with the Village or otherwise, from and against any losses, liabilities,
penalties, damages, claims, judgments and actions, including attorney's fees and court costs,
arising directly or indirectly out of, or in any way associated with, the release of Contaminants
from the Site or the existence of Contaminants in the Right-of-Way or in the rights-of--way under
the jurisdiction of other governmental agencies. This Paragraph shall survive the termination of
this Supplemental Agreement.



                                                  2
         13.     TN agrees to reimburse the Village for the reasonable costs it has inctmed, if any,
prior to the execution of this Supplemental Agreement in protecting human health and the
environment including, but not limited to, identifying, investigating, handling, storing and
disposing of contaminated groundwater and soils in the Right-of-Way as a result of the release of
Contaminants at this Site related to the Incident. Further, TN agrees to reimburse the Village for
the reasonable costs it has incurred in investigating the request by TN for the HAA and LGWO
and in reviewing this Supplemental Agreement, including reasonable attorney's fees, in an
amount not to exceed $7,000.00. Further, TN agrees to reimburse the Village for the reasonable
costs it incurs for replacing any Village water or sewer pipes that have been exposed to
Contaminants with water or sewer pipes, fittings and gaskets that are not pervious to entry by
Contaminants and that will not be adversely impacted by exposure to Contaminants.

         14.    This Supplemental Agreement shall be binding upon all grantees or successors in
interest to TN and upon all successors to the interest of the Village in the highway Right-of-Way.
A successor in interest of the Village would include, without limitation, a highway authority to
which the Village would transfer jurisdiction of the highway.

        15.     TN shall not assign or transfer this Supplemental Agreement or any interest in
this Supplemental Agreement without first obtaining the Village's written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably refused.

       16.     Violation of the terms of this Supplemental Agreement by TN, or its grantees or
successors in interest, may be grounds for voidance of this Supplemental Agreement and the
HAA by the Village.

        17.    This Supplemental Agreement shall continue in effect from the date hereof until:
(a) the Right-of- Way is demonstrated to be suitable for unrestricted usc; (b) there is no longer a
need for the HAA; and (c) the IEPA, upon written request by TN and with notice to the Village,
has amended the notice in the chain of title of the Site to reflect unencumbered future use of the
highway Right-of-Way and the ground water within the area of the LGWO.

         18.    Neither this Supplemental Agreement nor the HAA limits the Village's ability to
construct, reconstruct, improve, repair, maintain and operate a highway or utility facilities upon
its property, within the Right-of- Way or within the rights-of-way under the jurisdiction of other
governmental entities ("Work") or to allow others to use the highway Right-of-Way by permit.
The Village reserves the right, and the right of those using its property under permit, to manage,
move, remove and dispose of contaminated soil or groundwater, as may be reasonably necessary
for the Work, from, at, in, under or near those portions of its Right-of- Way in which
Contaminants exceed the Tier 1 residential remediation objectives, and to dispose of such
Contaminants, all as the Village or those using its property deem appropriate and not inconsistent
with applicable environmental regulations ("Remediation Activity"). For purposes of this
Supplemental Agreement, there is a rebuttable presumption that all Contaminants found at, on,
under or within the maximum area of Contaminant impacted soil and/or groundwater indicated
on Exhibit C to the HAA or the LGWO arc attributable to one or more releases of contamination
by or from the Site or from TN's USTs and UST piping at the Site.



                                                 3
         19.     Prior to taking any Remediation Activity, or prior to engaging in Work which
might require Remediation Activity, the Village will: (i) give TN not less than thirty (30) days
advance written notice (unless there is an immediate threat to the health or safct y of any
individual or to the public) that it intends to engage in Work in or ncar the Right-of-Way or
Rights-of-Way within which it has located or intends to locate public utilities which might
require Remediation Activity, or (ii) after Village has commenced Work, give TN not less than
ten (1 0) clays advance written notice (unless there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of
any individual or to the public) that it intends to undertake Remediation Activity to the extent
necessary for the Work. During the period following such notice, TN and Village shall engage in
a good faith collaborative process in an attempt to arrive at a consensus approach to managing,
removing, moving, disposing or remediating the contaminated soils and/or groundwater at, in,
under or near the Rights-of-Way. The failure of the Village to give notice is not a violation of
this Supplemental Agreement; provided, however, that if TN is not given notice pursuant to this
paragraph 19 the Village may not seck reimbursement under this Agreement for its fees and
costs in an amount in excess of $35,000. This $35,000 limitation on reimbursement specifically
excludes courtesy notice for immediate work as provided under Paragraph 20. Any actual
Remediation Activity shall be based upon a site investigation (which may be rnoclifiecl by field
conditions during excavation), or upon field conditions encountered after commencing Work. A
copy of this site investigation report (if any) will be provided to TN prior to any Remediation
Activity being undertaken.

        20.     If the Village determines, in its sole discretion, that there is an immediate threat to
the health or safety of any individual or to the public, or that there is an immediate need to
perform Work in order to investigate, maintain or restore utility services, or that there is an
immediate need to perform Work to maintain use of the Right-of-Way due to an obstruction,
defect or structural condition of the roadway, it is agreed that the Village will provide notice to
TN of such immediate need, as practical, prior to performing such Work, although notice in
such circumstances is not required under Paragraph 19 and shall be considered a courtesy under
this Supplemental Agreement.

         21.     If agreeable to the Village following such good faith negotiations, TN may elect
to perform, at its cost, the agreed upon site investigation and Remediation Activity, and TN shall,
at its cost, procure all necessary permits and shall post a completion bond in the amount of the
work to be performed prior to commencing such work. If as a result of these negotiations the
Village and TN are unable to reach a consensus, it is agreed that the Village will manage and
perform the Remediation Activity and TN will reimburse the Village for all reasonable costs and
fees incurred by the Village for such site investigation and Remediation Activity, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, within 45 days of an invoice from the Village. The failure of TN to
provide reimbursement to the Village within 45 days of receipt of an invoice from the Village, in
accordance with and pursuant to this paragraph, shall be grounds for voiding the BAA and
repealing the LGWO.

       22.     Written notice required by this Supplemental Agreement or the BAA shall be
mailed to the following: if to True North: David P. Nye, General Manager Environmental
Services, 10346 Brecksville Road, Brecksville, Ohio 44141; and if to Village: The Village of
Deerfield, 850 Waukegan Rd., Deerfield, IL 60015, ATTN: Village Manager.


                                                  4
        23.     The Village's sole responsibility under this Supplemental Agreement and BAA
with respect to others using the highway Right-of-Way under permit from the Village, or for the
benefit of the Village, is to include the following, or similar language, in permit or contract
provisions and to make an effort to notify its current permit holders of the following:

           "As a condition of this permit, the permittee shall request the Village Engineer to
           identify sites in the Right-of-Way where access to contaminated soil or groundwater
           is governed by Tiered Approach to Corrective-Action Objectives ("TACO")
           Agreements. The permittee shall take measures before, during and after any access to
           these sites to protect worker safety and human health and the environment.
           Excavated, contaminated soil should be managed off-site in accordance with all
           applicable laws, rules, and regulations."

        24.     TN hereby releases the Village from liability for breach of this Supplemental
Agreement by others under permit, and further indemnifies the Village against claims that may
arise from others under permit causing a breach of this Supplemental Agreement. TN agrees that
its personnel at the Site, if any, will exercise due diligence in notifying those accessing
contaminated soil in the Right-of-Way of their rights and responsibilities under this
Supplemental Agreement.

        25.     Should the Village breach this Supplemental Agreement or the BAA, TN's sole
remedy is for an action for damages which would be brought exclusively in the Lake County
Circuit Court. Any and all claims for damages against the Village, its agents, contractors, or
employees, or its successors in interest, arising at any time for a breach of this Supplemental
Agreement and/or HAA arc limited to an aggregate maximum of $10,000.00. TN shall have no
other action, in law or equity, against the Village, its agents, contractors, employees ami its
successors in interest for the breach of any other provision of this Supplemental Agreement and
TN hereby releases the Village, its agents, contractors, employees and its successors in interest
for any cause of action TN may have against them, other than as provided in this paragraph or as
provided by applicable environmental laws, regulations or common law governing the
contaminated soil or groundwater in the highway Right-of-Way. In the event that the Village
conveys, vacates or transfers jurisdiction of the highway Right-of-Way, TN may pursue an
action under this Agreement against the successors in interest, other than a State agency, in a
court of law.

        26.     This Supplemental Agreement and BAA arc entered into by the Village, and the
LGWO is adopted by the Village, in recognition of laws passed by the lllinois General Assembly
and regulations adopted by the IPCB which encourage a tiered-approach to rcmediating
environmental contamination. This Supplemental Agreement and BAA are entered into by the
Village in the spirit of those laws and under its rights and obligations as a highway authority. In
the event that any provision of this Supplemental Agreement is struck down as beyond the
authority of the Village, this Supplemental Agreement shall be null and void, except that all costs
and expenses to be paid by TN as provided in this Supplemental Agreement which have been
incurred by the Village shall be reimbursed by TN within 45 clays after the Supplemental
Agreement becomes null and void.

HIGHWAY AUTHORITY AGREEMENT ('TIAA")
                            HIGHWAY AUTHORITY AGREEMENT

       This Agreement is entered into this_day                        201 ~\mrsuant to 35
Ill. Adm. Code 742.1020 by and between True North Energy LLC ("Owner/Operator") and
the Village of Deerfield, Illinois ("Deerfield"), collectively known as the "Parties."

       WHEREAS, True North Energy LLC is the owner or operator of one or more leaking
underground storage tanks presently or formerly located at 2 Waukegan Rd., Deerfield, Illinois
(the "Site");

        WHEREAS, as a result of one or more releases of contaminants at the above referenced
Site "(the "Release"), soil and/or groundwater contamination at the Site exceeds the Tier 1
residential remediation objectives of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 742;

      WHEREAS, the soil and/or groundwater contamination exceeding Tier 1 residential
remediation objectives extends or may extend into the Highway Authority's right-of-way;

      WHEREAS, the Owner/Operator or Property Owner is conducting corrective action in
response to the Release;

        WHEREAS, the Parties desire to limit access to soil within the right-of-way that exceeds
Tier I residential remediation objectives so that human health and the environment are protected
during and after any access;


      NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:

       1. The recitals set forth above are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein

       2. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency has assigned incident number 20080899
          to the Release.

       3. Attached as Exhibit A is a scaled map(s) prepared by the Owner/Operator that
          shows the Site and surrounding area and delineates the current and estimated future
          extent of soil and groundwater contamination above the applicable Tier I residential
          remediation objectives as a result of the Release.

       4. Attached as Exhibit B is a table(s) prepared by the Owner/Operator that lists each
          contaminant of concern that exceeds its Tier I residential remediation objective, its
          Tier I residential remediation objective and its concentrations within the zone where
          Tier I residential remediation objectives arc exceeded. The locations of the
          concentrations listed in Exhibit B arc identified on the map(s) in Exhibit A.

       5. Attached as Exhibit C is a scaled map prepared by the Owner/Operator showing the
          roadway areas within which Deerfield maintains utility lines on Waukegan Road
          which is adjacent to the Site that arc governed by this agreement ("Right-of-Way").
          Because Exhibit Cis not a surveyed plat, the Right-of-Way boundary is that area of
    Waukegan Rd. which is within the depicted area and which may be an approximation
    ofthe actual Right-of-Way lines. Because the collection of samples within the Right-
    of-Way is not practical, the Parties stipulate that, based on modeling, soil and
    groundwater contamination exceeding Tier 1 residential remediation objectives does
    not and will not extend beyond the boundaries of the Right-of- Way or that area which
    is depicted within Exhibit C.

6. Deerfield stipulates it maintains utilities within the Right-of- Way that gives it access
   to the soil located within or beneath the Right-of- Way.

7. Deerfield agrees that to the limit of its ability to do so, it will prohibit within the
   Right -of-Way all potable and domestic uses of groundwater exceeding Tier 1
   residential remediation objectives.

8. Deerfield further agrees to limit access by itself and others who arc under its control
   to soil within the Right-of Way exceeding Tier 1 residential remediation objectives.
   Access shall be allowed only if human health (including worker safety) and the
   environment arc protected during and after any access. Deerfield may construct,
   reconstruct, improve, repair, maintain and operate its utilities within the Right-of-
   Way, or allow others to do the same by permit. In addition, Deerfield and others using
   or working in the Right-of- Way under permit for utility work have the right to
   remove soil or groundwater from the Right-of- Way and dispose of the same in
   accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Deerfield agrees to
   allow utility work on its behalf in the Right-of- Way subject to the following or a
   substantially similar condition: As a condition of this permit or contract the permittee
   shall request the office issuing this permit or access right to identify sites 111 the Right-
   of- Way where Deerfield governs access to soil that exceeds the Tier 1 residential
   remediation objectives of 35 111. Adm. Code 742. The permittee shall take all
   measures necessary to protect human health (including worker safety) and the
   environment during and after any access to such soil.

9. This agreement may be but is not required to be referenced in the Illinois
   Environmental Protection Agency's (the "Agency") no further remediation
   determination issued for the Release.

IO.Ifrequired by the Agency, the Agency shall be notified of any transfer of jurisdiction
   over the Right-of- Way at least 30 clays prior to the date the transfer takes effect. This
   agreement shall be null and void upon the transfer unless the transferee agrees to be
   bound by this agreement as if the transferee were an original party to this agreement.
   The transferee's agreement to be bound by the terms of this agreement shall be
   memorialized at the time of transfer in a writing ("Rider") that references this
   llighway Authority Agreement and is signed by Deerfield, or subsequent transferor,
   and the transferee.

II. This agreement shall become effective on the date the Agency issues a no further
    remediation determination for the Release. It shall remain effective until the Right-of-



                                           2
           Way is demonstrated to be suitable for unrestricted use and, if required to be filed by
           the Agency, once the Agency issues a new no further remediation determination to
           reflect there is no longer need for this agreement, or until the agreement is otherwise
           terminated or voided.

       12. In addition to any other remedies that may be available, if the Agency has determined
           that this Agreement is required to obtain an NFR determination, the Agency may
           bring suit to enforce the terms of this agreement or may, in its sole discretion, declare
           this agreement null and void if any of the Parties or any transferee violates any term
           of this agreement. The Parties or transferee shall be notified in writing of any such
           declaration.

       13. This agreement shall be null and void if a court of competent jurisdiction strikes
           down any part or provision of the agreement.

       14. This agreement supersedes any prior written or oral agreements or understandings
           between the Parties on the subject matter addressed herein. It may be altered,
           modified or amended only upon the written consent and agreement of the Parties.

Subject:       Report and Recommendation regarding 655 Waukegan Road (Shell) request for Limited
               Area Groundwater Use Restriction Ordinance
Action Requested:     Accept Report and Recommendation
 Originated By: Director of Public Works and Engineering
Referred To:    Mayor and Board of Trustees
Summary of Background and Reason for Request:
We have received a request from 655 Waukegan Road (Shell) to institute a Limited Area Groundwater
Use Restriction Ordinance (LGWO) that is specifically in accordance with the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency (IEPA) requirements. The Village of Deerfield Municipal Code requires that "No new
wells may be established and used for the supply of potable water in any area of the village". ((Ord. 0-99-
24, 5-3-1999) - Section 23-6A.).

The ownership of 655 Waukegan (Shell), True North Energy, LLC, recently submitted their executed
documents for this property and indicated their desire for the village to complete their process to approve
a LGWO. In April 2012 we requested authorization from the Board to retain the services of AECOM to
review and provide recommendations on this request. AECOM has now completed their evaluation (see
attachment). Their report states that they concur with the LGWO with the boundary as shown on Exhibit
A in the document. This would address potential and actual groundwater impacts. If approved by the
Board of Trustees, this ordinance will be submitted to the IEPA as part of the Site Remedial Action Plan.
We recommend that the Board accept the AECOM report and approve the LGWO for the subject
property.

Due to the fact that the Village has right of way and underground utilities within the potential
contamination area we requested the property owner and business to enter into a Supplemental Agreement
with the Village. This document was prepared by the Village of Deerfield Attorney. It outlines
responsibilities of the owner/ business and the village, especially if the village needs to make an
underground utility repair or excavation. This agreement provides for ownership's reimbursement to the
village for engineer and attorney expenses. The Supplemental Agreement includes two attachments, a
Highway Authority Agreement and the LGWO. The Highway Authority Agreement also includes
updated soil and groundwater impact maps and analytical results. The agreement is attached and
presented to you for your review and approval.

We recommend that the Board accept the AECOM report and approve the Supplemental Agreement for
655 Waukegan Road (Shell), Deerfield, Illinois, including the Highway Authority Agreement and the
Limited Area Groundwater Use Restriction Ordinance.

Subject:    Summary Letter for
            Shell Service Station # 1916
            655 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, Illinois
            AECOM Project No. 60266708


Dear Ms. Little:

AECOM Technical Services, Inc. (AECOM) has prepared this summary letter of our review of
environmental documents associated with the above-referenced site (the site). We understand that
the owner of the above referenced site is seeking closure for the site through the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency's (IEPA) Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Program. In
order to facilitate this closure they are requesting the Village of Deerfield (the Village) implement an
institutional control (groundwater use restriction ordinance) as further protection from the
environmental impacts associated with the site. The purpose of this review is to assess the
feasibility of site closure using institutional controls, including a groundwater ordinance.

AECOM reviewed environmental documents provided by the Village. These documents include the
following:

    1.   Corrective Action Plan, URS, dated August 13, 2012
    2.   Tiered Approach To Corrective-Action Objectives Supplemental Agreement
    3.   Highway Authority Agreement
    4.   Limited Area Groundwater Ordinance

Based on the review of the above documents, the gasoline station located at 655 Waukegan Road
in Deerfield, Illinois has experienced a release of unleaded gasoline that has impacted subsurface
soil and groundwater. Gasoline constituents including benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and xylenes
(BETX) and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) have been detected in the subsurface at the site. In
response to the release of gasoline, LUST incidents #20080898 and #20120359 were assigned to
the site.

In response to the release, URS on behalf of True North Energy, LLC, is proposing to address the
gasoline impacts using institutional controls. The owner of the property will be required by the IEPA
to implement the institutional controls below to address these impacts. Except for the Limited Area
Groundwater Use Restriction Ordinance (LGWO) as discussed below, approval of the following
institutional controls is within the jurisdiction of the IEPA. For purposes of this letter, AECOM has
assumed that the IEPA will require compliance with all of these items before issuing a No Further
Remediation (NFR) letter.
AECOM                                        Summary Letter                                 Shell Service Station #1916        2
                                                                                            655 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, IL




The IEPA has established cleanup standards that need to be meet for both soil and groundwater
before a NFR letter can be issued for the site. These standards are provided in 35 Illinois
Administrative Code (IAC) 742. There are three sets of Tier 1 standards; one for residential
properties, one for commercial/industrial properties and a third for potential construction worker
protection in case of future excavation work on the site. Each of the Tier 1 standards includes three
sets of cleanup objectives for the different exposure routes; inhalation, soil ingestion and
groundwater ingestion. Initially the soil and groundwater concentrations are compared to Tier 1
standards which are in look up tables. If any of the Tier 1 objective values are exceeded then Tier 2
calculation can be performed.

The following is a summary of each of the three exposure routes.

Inhalation Exposure Route

Based on the URS report, benzene concentrations in on-site soil exceed the Tier 1 residential soil
remedial objectives (SROs) for inhalation. The Tier 1 Construction Worker Inhalation Exposure
SROs have also been exceeded by the concentrations of benzene, ethylbenzene and xylenes
detected in the soil. In order to further assess the inhalation exposure, URS conducted Tier 2
calculations using site specific data. A comparison of the maximum concentrations detected to the
Tier 2 SROs indicates that the residential inhalation and construction inhalation SROs have been
met. Based on the comparison, institutional controls at the site are not required to address the
inhalation exposure route.

However, if the inhalation SRO exceedances extend off-site beneath Longfellow Avenue, then the
proposed Highway Authority Agreement (HAA) would need to be implemented to obtain closure.
This would require the Village as the "Highway Authority" to approve of the proposed HAA. The
IEPA will need to make a determination whether the HAA is required for closure of the site.

Soil Ingestion Exposure Route

Based on the URS report BETX and MTBE concentrations in on-site soil are below the Tier 1SROs
for soil ingestion. Therefore, no institutional controls are needed to address the soil ingestion
exposure route.

Groundwater Ingestion Exposure Route

           Soil Component of Groundwater Ingestion

The concentrations of benzene, ethylbenzene and xylenes in the on-site soil exceed the Tier 1 Soil
Component to Groundwater Ingestion SROs. URS calculated Tier 2 equations to demonstrate the
potential for these petroleum constituents to leach from the soil into the groundwater. The soil
concentrations based on the calculations indicate that the soil contaminant concentrations could
adversely impact the groundwater beneath the site. However, additional calculations performed by
URS indicated that the potential groundwater impacts from the soil will attenuate before migrating
off-site.

           Groundwater Component of Groundwater Ingestion

The concentrations of benzene, ethylbenzene and MTBE detected in the groundwater at the site
have the potential to migrate off-site before the impacts would dissipate to concentrations below the
Class II Groundwater Remedial Objectives.

                                                                                            655 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, IL




AECOM has reviewed the proposed Limited Area Groundwater Use Restriction Ordinance (LGWO)
and concurs that LGWO would effectively address the petroleum groundwater impacts, if approved
by the IEPA. The proposed ordinance will need to meet the requirements from 35 IAC 742.1015.
In addition to the use of the LGWO, the IEPA will require written notifications to adjacent properties
within the area of groundwater use restriction, which could be potentially be impacted by the
gasoline release.

General Closure Requirements

In order to exclude exposure routes utilizing the institutional controls above, 35 IAC 742.300
requires the following:

     1. A demonstration that the sum of the concentrations of all organic contaminants of concern
        do not exceed the attenuation capacity of the soil as determined under Section 742.215;

     2. A demonstration that the concentrations of any organic contaminants of concern remaining
        in the soil shall not exceed the soil saturation limit as determined under Section 742.220;

     3. A demonstration that the soil, which contains contaminants of concern, shall not exhibit any
        of the characteristics of reactivity for hazardous waste as determined under 35 Ill. Adm.
        Code 721.123;

Based on the URS report, these three exclusion criteria have been demonstrated.

AECOM appreciates the opportunity to provide consulting services for the Village of Deerfield.
Please feel free to contact the undersigned if you have questions regarding this letter.


Sincerely yours,

           TIERED APPROACH TO CORRECTIVE-ACTION OBJECTIVES
                       SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT

      This Supplemental Agreement ("Supplemental Agreement") to establish obligations of
True North Energy LLC ("TN") is entered into this _ _ day of _ _ , 2013, by and between
TN and the Village ofDeerfield, Illinois ("Village"), as follows:

         1. The duly authorized representatives of TN have signed this Supplemental Agreement.
This Supplemental Agreement is binding upon the parties, their successors and assigns upon
execution by the Village. This Supplemental Agreement shall be null and void if the Illinois
Protection Agency ("IEP A") does not approve the attached Highway Authority Agreement
("HAA") [Attachment 1] as an institutional control for the Site and the Limited Area
Groundwater Use Restriction Ordinance ("LGWO") [Attachment 2] (as defined below) as an
institutional control for the Site and the closure of the Incident (as defined below).

       2.       TN is owner and operator of the gasoline underground storage tanks and the
automobile service station facility located on the property commonly known as 655 Waukegan
Road, Deerfield, Illinois and legally described on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Site").

        3. TN is pursuing a corrective action of the Site and ofthe rights-of-way adjacent
thereto (the "Right-of-Way"), as depicted on Exhibit C to the HAA as set forth below.
"Corrective action" means the clean-up or removal of Contaminants (as defined in Paragraph 4
below) from soil or groundwater under an impermeable surface beneath the Right-of-Way
depicted on Exhibit C attached to the HAA, or within the area depicted in the LGWO, such that
the impacted soil or groundwater will be in compliance with Illinois Pollution Control Board
("IPCB") Tier II site specific standards pursuant to 35 Ill. Administrative Code Part 742 as
approved by the IEPA, or if such impacted soil or groundwater is not located under an IEP A
approved impermeable surface pursuant to an IEP A approved HAA, or within an IEPA approved
LGWO, will be in compliance with IPCB Tier I residential standards.

         4. Attached to the HAA as Group Exhibit Bare tables prepared by TN showing the
concentration of contaminants of concern ("Contaminants") in soil and/or groundwater within
the Site, and which show the applicable Tier 1 soil remediation objectives for residential
property and Tier 1 objectives for groundwater of the Illinois Pollution Control Board ("IPCB").
Attached to the HAA as Exhibit Cis a drawing prepared by TN which depicts the Right-of-Way
and which shows TN' s maximum area of Contaminant impacted soil and/or groundwater where,
at the time of this Supplemental Agreement, Contaminants are estimated to exceed the Tier 1
residential levels under 35 Ill. Admin. Code Part 742. As the drawings in the Exhibits are not
surveyed plats, the boundary ofthe Right-of-Way in the Exhibits may be an approximation ofthe
actual Right-of-Way lines. It is impracticable to sample the Right -of-Way for Contaminants;
however, TN has represented to Village that the area ofthe Right-of-Way is adequate to
encompass soil and/or groundwater within the Right-of-Way possibly impacted with
Contaminants from a release at the Site.

      5. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency has assigned incident numbers
20080898 and 20120359 to the release at the Site ("Incident").



                                               1
        6. TN intends to request risk-based, site specific soil and/or groundwater remediation
objectives from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency ("IEPA") under 35 Ill. Admin.
Code Part 742.

         7. Under these rules, use ofrisk-based, site specific remediation objectives in the Right-
of-Way may require the use of a Highway Authority Agreement as defined in 35 Ill. Admin.
Code Section 742.1020 and a Limited Area Groundwater Use Restriction Ordinance as defined
in 35 Ill. Admin. Code Section 742.1015.

        8. The Village holds a fee simple interest, a dedication for highway purposes or an
easement for utility purposes in the Right-of-Way or some parts of the Right-of-Way, or the
Right-of-Way is a platted street, and has jurisdiction of such Right-of-Way or parts thereof, or
the Village now has or will install public utilities within the Right-of-Way which may be under
the jurisdiction of other governmental entities. For purposes of this Supplemental Agreement,
"jurisdiction" means that the Village exercises access control over the use of groundwater
beneath the Right-of-Way and the area depicted in the LGWO and over access to the soil beneath
the Right-of-Way because it requires a permit for that access or the Village has public utilities
within the Rights-of-Way which are under the jurisdiction of other governmental entities.

        9.      This Supplemental Agreement is intended to establish the undertakings ofTN to
the Village for the purpose of providing the HAA and the LGWO in the form required by the
IPCB to the IEPA which establishes that the Village is willing to agree that it will not allow the
use of groundwater within the LGWO depicted area and under the highway Rights-of-Way
which is under its jurisdiction as a potable or other domestic supply of water and that it will limit
access to soil under the Right-of-Way which is under its jurisdiction as described herein.

        10.    This Supplemental Agreement shall be null and void should the IEP A not approve
the HAA and/or the LGWO or should this Supplemental Agreement not be referenced in the
"No Further Remediation" determination; provided, however, that TN's agreement in Paragraph
12 to defend and indemnify the Village and to reimburse the Village for certain costs shall not be
null and void.

       11.     The Village has agreed to certain obligations in the HAA as set forth in
paragraphs 6 through 12 of that document subject to the terms of this Supplemental Agreement.

         12.     TN agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Village, the Village's
officers, agents, contractors, permittees and employees, and other highway authorities, if any,
that own or have maintenance jurisdiction over the Right-of-Way or some parts of the Right-of-
Way by an agreement with the Village or otherwise, from and against any losses, liabilities,
penalties, damages, claims, judgments and actions, including attorney's fees and court costs,
arising directly or indirectly out of, or in any way associated with, the release of Contaminants
from the Site or the existence of Contaminants in the Right-of-Way or in the rights-of-way under
the jurisdiction of other governmental agencies. This Paragraph shall survive the termination of
this Supplemental Agreement.




                                                  2
         13.     TN agrees to reimburse the Village for the reasonable costs it has incurred, if any,
prior to the execution of this Supplemental Agreement in protecting human health and the
environment including, but not limited to, identifying, investigating, handling, storing and
disposing of contaminated groundwater in the Right-of-Way as a result of the release of
Contaminants at this Site related to the Incident. Further, TN agrees to reimburse the Village for
the reasonable costs it has incurred in investigating the request by TN for the HAA and LGWO
and in reviewing this Supplemental Agreement, including reasonable attorney's fees, in an
amount not to exceed $7 ,000.00. Further, TN agrees to reimburse the Village for the reasonable
costs it incurs for replacing any Village water or sewer pipes that have been exposed to
Contaminants with water or sewer pipes, fittings and gaskets that are not pervious to entry by
Contaminants and that will not be adversely impacted by exposure to Contaminants.

         14.   This Supplemental Agreement shall be binding upon all grantees or successors in
interest to TN and upon all successors to the interest of the Village in the highway Right-of-Way.
A successor in interest of the Village would include, without limitation, a highway authority to
which the Village would transfer jurisdiction of the highway.

        15.     TN shall not assign or transfer this Supplemental Agreement or any interest in
this Supplemental Agreement without first obtaining the Village's written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably refused.

       16.     Violation ofthe terms of this Supplemental Agreement by TN, or its grantees or
successors in interest, may be grounds for voidance of this Supplemental Agreement and the
HAA by the Village.

        17     This Supplemental Agreement shall continue in effect from the date hereof until:
(a) the Right-of-Way is demonstrated to be suitable for unrestricted use; (b) there is no longer a
need for the HAA; and (c) the IEP A, upon written request by TN and with notice to the Village,
has amended the notice in the chain of title of the Site to reflect unencumbered future use of the
highway Right-of-Way and the ground water within the area of the LGWO.

        18.     Neither this Supplemental Agreement nor the HAA limits the Village's ability to
construct, reconstruct, improve, repair, maintain and operate a highway or utility facilities upon
its property, within the Right-of-Way or within the rights-of-way under the jurisdiction of other
governmental entities ("Work") or to allow others to use the highway Right-of-Way by permit.
The Village reserves the right, and the right of those using its property under permit, to manage,
move, remove and dispose of contaniinated soil or groundwater, as may be reasonably necessary
for the Work, from, at, in, under or near those portions of its Right-of-Way in which
Contaminants exceed the Tier 1 residential remediation objectives, and to dispose of such
Contaminants, all as the Village or those using its property deem appropriate and not inconsistent
with applicable environmental regulations ("Remediation Activity"). For purposes of this
Supplemental Agreement, there is a rebuttable presumption that all Contaminants found at, on,
under or within the maximum area of Contaminant impacted soil and/or groundwater indicated
on Exhibit C to the HAA or the LGWO is attributable to one or more releases of contamination
by or from the Site or from TN's USTs and UST piping at the Site.




                                                  3
         19.    Prior to taking any Remediation Activity, or prior to engaging in Work which
might require Remediation Activity, the Village will: (i) give TN not less than thirty (30) days
advance written notice (unless there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of any
individual or to the public) that it intends to engage in Work in or near the Right -of-Way or
Rights-of-Way within which it has located or intends to locate public utilities which might
require Remediation Activity, or(ii) after Village has commenced Work, give TN not less than
ten (1 0) days advance written notice (unless there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of
any individual or to the public) that it intends to undertake Remediation Activity to the extent
necessary for the Work. During the period following such notice, TN and Village shall engage in
a good faith collaborative process in an attempt to arrive at a consensus approach to managing,
removing, moving, disposing or remediating the contaminated soils and/or groundwater at, in,
under or near the Rights-of-Way. The failure ofthe Village to give notice is not a violation of
this Supplemental Agreement; provided, however, that if TN is not given notice pursuant to this
paragraph 19 the Village may not seek reimbursement under this Agreement for its fees and
costs in an amount in excess of $35,000. This $35,000 limitation on reimbursement specifically
excludes courtesy notice for immediate work as provided under Paragraph 20. Any actual
Remediation Activity shall be based upon a site investigation (which may be modified by field
conditions during excavation), or upon field conditions encountered after commencing Work. A
copy of this site investigation report (if any) will be provided to TN prior to any Remediation
Activity being undertaken.

        20.     If the Village determines, in its sole discretion, that there is an immediate threat to
the health or safety of any individual or to the public, or that there is an immediate need to
perform Work in order to investigate, maintain or restore utility services, or that there is an
immediate need to perform Work to maintain use ofthe Right-of-Way due to an obstruction,
defect or structural condition of the roadway, it is agreed that the Village will provide notice to
TN of such immediate need, as practical, prior to performing such Work, although notice in
such circumstances is not required under Paragraph 19 and shall be considered a courtesy under
this Supplemental Agreement.

         21.     If agreeable to the Village following such good faith negotiations, TN may elect
to perform, at its cost, the agreed upon site investigation and Remediation Activity, and TN shall,
at its cost, procure all necessary permits and shall post a completion bond in the amount of the
work to be performed prior to commencing such work. If as a result of these negotiations the
Village and TN are unable to reach a consensus, it is agreed that the Village will manage and
perform the Remediation Activity and TN will reimburse the Village for all reasonable costs and
fees incurred by the Village for such site investigation and Remediation Activity, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, within 45 days of an invoice from the Village. The failure of TN to
provide reimbursement to the Village within 45 days of receipt of an invoice from the Village, in
accordance with and pursuant to this paragraph, shall be grounds for voiding the HAA and
repealing the LGWO.

22.     Written notice required by this Supplemental Agreement or the HAA shall be mailed to
the following: ifto True North: David P. Nye, General Manager Environmental Services, 10346
Brecksville Road, Brecksville, Ohio 44141; and if to Village: The Village of Deerfield, 850
Waukegan Rd., Deerfield, IL 60015, ATTN: Village Manager.



                                                   4
        23.     The Village's sole responsibility under this Supplemental Agreement and HAA
with respect to others using the highway Right-of-Way under permit from the Village, or for the
benefit of the Village, is to include the following, or similar language, in permit or contract
provisions and to make an effort to notify its current permit holders of the following:

           "As a condition of this permit, the permittee shall request the Village Engineer to
           identify sites in the Right-of-Way where access to contaminated soil or groundwater
           is governed by Tiered Approach to Corrective-Action Objectives ("TACO")
           Agreements. The permittee shall take measures before, during and after any access to
           these sites to protect worker safety and human health and the environment.
           Excavated, contaminated soil should be managed off-site in accordance with all
           applicable laws, rules, and regulations."

        24.     TN hereby releases the Village from liability for breach of this Supplemental
Agreement by others under permit, and further indemnifies the Village against claims that may
arise from others under permit causing a breach of this Supplemental Agreement. TN agrees that
its personnel at the Site, if any, will exercise due diligence in notifying those accessing
contaminated soil in the Right-of-Way of their rights and responsibilities under this
Supplemental Agreement.

        25.     Should the Village breach this Supplemental Agreement or the HAA, TN's sole
remedy is for an action for damages which would be brought exclusively in the Lake County
Circuit Court. Any and all claims for damages against the Village, its agents, contractors, or
employees, or its successors in interest, arising at any time for a breach this Supplemental
Agreement and/or HAA are limited to an aggregate maximum of $10,000.00. TN shall have no
other action, in law or equity, against the Village, its agents, contractors, employees and its
successors in interest for the breach of any other provision of this Supplemental Agreement and
TN hereby releases the Village, its agents, contractors, employees and its successors in interest
for any cause of action TN may have against them, other than as provided in this paragraph or as
provided by applicable environmental laws, regulations or common law governing the
contaminated soil or groundwater in the highway Right-of-Way. In the event that the Village
conveys, vacates or transfers jurisdiction ofthe highway Right-of-Way, TN may pursue an
action under this Agreement against the successors in interest, other than a State agency, in a
court of law.

        26.     This Supplemental Agreement and HAA are entered into by the Village, and the
LGWO is adopted by the Village, in recognition oflaws passed by the Illinois General Assembly
and regulations adopted by the IPCB which encourage a tiered-approach to remediating
environmental contamination. This Supplemental Agreement and HAA are entered into by the
Village in the spirit of those laws and under its rights and obligations as a highway authority. In
the event that any provision of this Supplemental Agreement is struck down as beyond the
authority of the Village, this Supplemental Agreement shall be null and void, except that all costs
and expenses to be paid by TN as provided in this Supplemental Agreement which have been
incurred by the Village shall be reimbursed by TN within 45 days after the Supplemental
Agreement becomes null and void.

HIGHWAY AUTHORITY AGREEMENT ("HAA")
                       HIGHWAY AUTHORITY AGREEMENT

       This Agreement is entered into this_day of              , 201fpursuant to 35
Ill. Adm. Code 742.1020 by and between True North Energy LLC
("Owner/Operator") and the Village ofDeerfield, Illinois ("Highway Authority"),
collectively known as the "Parties."

       WHEREAS, True North Energy LLC is the owner or operator of one or more
leaking underground storage tanks presently or formerly located at 655 Waukegan Rd.,
Deerfield, Illinois (the "Site");

       WHEREAS, as a result of one or more releases of contaminants at the above
referenced Site "(the "Release"), soil and/or groundwater contamination at the Site
exceeds the Tier I residential remediation objectives of35 Ill. Adm. Code 742;

       WHEREAS, the soil and/or groundwater contamination exceeding Tier 1
residential remediation objectives extends or may extend into the Highway
Authority's right-of-way;

       WHEREAS, the Owner/Operator or Property Owner is conducting corrective
action in response to the Release;

       WHEREAS, the Parties desire to prevent groundwater beneath the Highway
Authority's right-of-way that exceeds Tier I remediation objectives from use as a supply
of potable or domestic water and to limit access to soil within the right-of-way that
exceeds Tier I residential remediation objectives so that human health and the
environment are protected during and after any access;

      NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:

       1. The recitals set forth above are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth
          herein

       2. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency has assigned incident number.5
          20080898~o the Release.
                     01na 20/?.,0pSq
       3. Attached as Exhibit A is a scaled map(s) prepared by the Owner/Operator
          that shows the Site and surrounding area and delineates the current and
          estimated future extent of soil and groundwater contamination above the
          applicable Tier I residential remediation objectives as a result of the Release.

       4. Attached as Exhibit B is a table(s) prepared by the Owner/Operator that lists
          each contaminant of concern that exceeds its Tier I residential remediation
          objective, its Tier I residential remediation objective and its concentrations
          within the zone where Tier I residential remediation objectives are exceeded.
          The locations of the concentrations listed in Exhibit B are identified on the


                                             1
                                                                                     . ·~ .
                                                                                              ·"'·'




   map(s) in Exhibit A.

5. Attached as Exhibit Cis a scaled map prepared by the Owner/Operator
   showing the area of the Highway Authority's right-of-way on Longfellow
   A venue which are adjacent to the Site that are governed by this agreement
   ("Right-of-Way"). Because Exhibit Cis not a surveyed plat, the Right-of-
   Way boundary may be an approximation of the actual Right-of-Way lines.
   Because the collection of samples within the Right-of-Way is not practical,
   the Parties stipulate that, based on modeling, soil and groundwater
   contamination exceeding Tier I residential remediation objectives does not
   and will not extend beyond the boundaries ofthe Right-of-Way.

6. The Highway Authority stipulates it has jurisdiction over the Right-of-Way
   that gives it sole control over the use of the groundwater and access to the soil
   located within or beneath the Right-of-Way.

7. The Highway Authority agrees that to the limit of its ability to do so, it will
   prohibit within the Right-of-Way all potable and domestic uses of
   groundwater exceeding Tier I residential remediation objectives.

8. The Highway Authority further agrees to limit access by itself and others to
   soil within the Right-of Way exceeding Tier I residential remediation
   objectives. Access shall be allowed only if human health (including worker
   safety) and the environment are protected during and after any access. The
   Highway Authority may construct, reconstruct, improve, repair, maintain and
   operate a highway upon the Right-of-Way, or allow others to do the same by
   permit. In addition, the Highway Authority and others using or working in the
   Right-of-Way under permit have the right to remove soil or groundwater from
   the Right-of-Way and dispose ofthe same in accordance with applicable
   environmental laws and regulations. The Highway Authority agrees to issue
   all permits for work in the Right-of-Way, and make all existing permits for
   work in the Right-of-Way, subject to the following or a substantially similar
   condition: As a condition of this permit the permittee shall request the office
   issuing this permit to identifY sites in the Right-of-Way where a Highway
   Authority Agreement governs access to soil that exceeds the Tier I residential
   remediation objectives of35 Ill. Adm. Code 742. The permittee shall take all
   measures necessary to protect human health (including worker safety) and the
   environment during and after any access to such soil.

9. This agreement shall be referenced in the Illinois Environmental Protection
   Agency's (the "Agency") no further remediation determination issued for the
   Release.

10. The Agency shall be notified of any transfer of jurisdiction over the Right-of-
    Way at least 30 days prior to the date the transfer takes effect. This agreement                  ,-··
    shall be null and void upon the transfer unless the transferee agrees to be



                                      2
          bound by this agreement as if the transferee were an original party to this
          agreement. The transferee's agreement to be bound by the terms of this
          agreement shall be memorialized at the time of transfer in a writing ("Rider")
          that references this Highway Authority Agreement and is signed by the
          Highway Authority, or subsequent transferor, and the transferee.

       11. This agreement shall become effective on the date the Agency issues a no
           further remediation determination for the Release. It shall remain effective
           until the Right-of-Way is demonstrated to be suitable for unrestricted use and
           the Agency issues a new no further remediation determination to reflect that
           there is no longer need for this agreement, or until the agreement is otherwise
           terminated or voided.

       12. In addition to any other remedies that may be available, the Agency may
           bring suit to enforce the terms of this agreement or may, in its sole discretion,
           declare this agreement null and void if any of the Parties or any transferee
           violates any term of this agreement. The Parties or transferee shall be notified
           in writing of any such declaration.

       13. This agreement shall be null and void if a court of competent jurisdiction
           strikes down any part or provision of the agreement.

       14. This agreement supersedes any prior written or oral agreements or
           understandings between the Parties on the subject matter addressed herein. It
           may be altered, modified or amended only upon the written consent and
           agreement of the Parties.

       15. Any notices or other correspondence regarding this agreement shall be sent to
           the Parties at following addresses:

                        BACKGROUND
                        In an effort to facilitate traffic flow and to allow for the safe movement of pedestrian traffic on
                        the grounds and property of schools within Deerfield School District No. 109, the Police
                        Department and the District have collaborated to develop a site plan for each of the schools
                        within the District; Kipling, Walden, Shephard, South Park, Caruso and Wilmot Elementary.
                        Each plan includes the location of parking lot regulatory and informational signage as well as
                        planned traffic flow patterns at each of the facilities. As part of the collaboration between the
                        entities an "Agreement for Regulation ofMotor Vehicle Traffic and Parking" was developed
                        for each of the schools (attached) and approved by the Deerfield School District 109 Board of
                        Education on April15, 2013.

                        vehicle traffic and parking on the schools property. By approval of "An Ordinance

                        Vehicle Traffic and Parking on School Property" (see attachment) the Village gains the
                        authority to enforce local and state laws on school property. This request has been requested
                        and approved by the School District Board of Education.

                        RECOMMENDATION
                        It is the recommendation of the Police Department that the Mayor and Board approve "An
                        Ordinance Authorizing Agreements with Deerfield School District No. 109 For The

Subject               Intergovemmental Agreement (IGA) For The Installation and Maintenance of a New
                      Walkway in Jewett Park

Action Requested:     Approval ofiGA

Originated By:        Village Manager's Office

Referred To:          Village President and Board of Trustees

Summary of Background and Reason for Request

As the Board may recall, the amended special use permit issued to the Deerfield Public Library by
Ordinance 0-11-32 for the renovations to the Deerfield Public Library at 920 Waukegan Road requires
employees to park off-site and the installation of a lit walkway connecting the stairs west of the library to
the Park District parking lot for Jewett Park on the south side of Hazel Avenue. Given the requirement for
offsite parking and the need to maintain the lit walkway, the attached intergovernmental agreement
between the Library, Park District and Village was prepared to memorialize the use, construct the walkway
and establish for on-going maintenance and lighting energy costs.

The Library and Park District finalized the walkway's location and coordinated its design and lighting
systems to match and integrate with the other walkways and lights in Jewett Park. Once the design was
completed, the Library included bidding out the installation work as pmi of the construction project for the
Library. The IGA provides that the Village supp01i the construction cost with an $85,000 contribution, the
Library a $25,000 contribution and the Park District contribute maintenance and lighting energy costs
going forward. The Library also had to replace the stairway leading down into Jewett Park for it to be code
compliant and had other costs, including construction oversight, for the new walkway. Both the Library
Board and Park Board have executed the agreement. It is also suggested that the Board consider allocating
future impact fees collected for residential projects (AMLI, etc.) to offset this expense as it is an
improvement that meets the criteria in the impact fee ordinance.

The Village Manager will be available to review this matter and respond to questions from the Mayor and
Board of Trustees.

                              REQUEST FOR BOARD ACTION
                                                                           Agenda Item: 13-58
 Subject:       Approval of Wastewater Reclamation Facility (WRF) Improvement Project
                Change Order No. 20
 Action Requested:     Authorize Change Order No. 20 (Various) for a Credit of $17,983.00
 Originated By: Director of Public Works and Engineering
 Referred To:    Mayor and Board of Trustees

Summary of Background and Reason for Request:

 The change order request has been summarized in the attached letter from Strand Associates,
 including the Change Order No. 20 document. The amount of the contract price adjustment
 requested with Change Order No. 20 is a credit in the amount of $17,983. This compares to
 previously approved change order adjustments in the aggregate amount of $505,645.70 yielding
 an overall increase to the original contract price of $487,662.70 or 1.7 percent (0.017) of the
 original contract value.

 The contractor has requested a 21 day contract completion date extension with this Change Order
 No. 20. The reason for this request is to complete the landscaping. If approved, the new
 completion date will be June 6, 2013.

 Items 20j through 20m are deductions due to the closeout of allowances on the contract that have
 not been fully used and are no longer needed.

 Strand Associates has reviewed all the materials and prices submitted by the contractor. They
 recommend approval of these items as described on the attached documents.

 The Director of Public Works and Engineering recommends that the Mayor and Board of
 Trustees authorize the adjustment to the WRF construction contract price for the items described,
 in the credit amount of $17,983 decreasing the total contract amount from the current value of
 $29,955,645.70 to $29,937,662.70.

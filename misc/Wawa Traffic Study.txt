EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of this study is to examine the potential traffic impact associated with a proposed
Wawa and Bank development on the roadway network in Abington Township, Montgomery
County, PA. Based on this evaluation, the following conclusions were reached:

1. The project site is located on the northwestern corner of the intersection of Route 611 (S.R.
   0309) and Baeder Road. The proposed site will consist of the following:
       4,691 square foot (s.f.) Wawa Convenience Market with 6 fueling pumps (12 fueling
       positions);
       3,500 square foot (s.f.) Bank with Drive-Thru Facilities.
2. The proposed site will be served by four (4) driveway locations, as follows:
       One Limited-Access Driveway to Route 611 (S.R. 0611) that will prohibit left-turn egress
       via median;
       One Limited-Access Driveway to Route 611 (S.R. 0611) that will prohibit left-turn
       ingress and egress via median;
       One Limited-Access Driveway to Re-Aligned Hilltop Road that will prohibit left-turn
       ingress and right-turn ingress/egress via design and signage;
       One Limited-Access Driveway to Re-Aligned Hilltop Road that will prohibit egress via
       signage.
3. All proposed driveway location sight distances will exceed all applicable sight distance
   criteria.
4. The proposed development will generate approximately 74 new trips during the weekday
   A.M. peak hour and 102 new trips during the weekday P.M. peak hour.
5. Under the 2014 and 2019 Projected Conditions, with implementation of the site-related
   recommendations, all intersections within the study area will satisfy PennDOT LOS Criteria
   during weekday A.M. and P.M.
6. Traffic Planning and Design Inc. (TPD) recommends the following roadway improvements
   as outlined at the study area intersections:
   Route 611 & Baeder Road/Hilltop Road
       Realignment of Hilltop Road to form a fifth leg at the signalized intersection of Route
       611 and Baeder Road/Noble Plaza. Hilltop Road should be aligned with Noble Plaza in
       such a fashion so that the two approaches will be able to operate simultaneously under
       the same signal phase;
       The existing eastbound Baeder Road through/right lane should be re-striped to a
       left/through/right lane configuration, in order to allow left-turn movements from both
       eastbound lanes onto NB Route 611;
       With the proposed dual left turn configuration on eastbound Baeder Road, the traffic
       signal should be re-designed to provide a separate phase;


                                               -i-
       Provide channelization for the eastbound Baeder Road and southbound Hilltop Road
       right-turn movements;
       Widening of the westbound Noble Plaza approach to provide two (2) egress lanes (WB
       Left and WB Thru/Right);
       Provide signal timing modifications during the weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours.
   Route 611 & The Fairway/Harte Road
       Optimize traffic signal timings during the weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours.
   Route 611 & Northern Site Driveway
       Provide a stop sign (PennDOT designation R1-1) to control exiting traffic;
       Provide adequate turning radii in order to facilitate safe and efficient ingress/egress;
       Provide a northbound left-turn lane on Route 611 within the existing median. This lane
       length should be maximized along the site frontage.
   Route 611 & Southern Site Driveway
       Provide a stop sign (PennDOT designation R1-1) to control exiting traffic;
       Provide adequate turning radii in order to facilitate safe and efficient ingress/egress;
       Provide a "Do Not Block Intersection" sign (PennDOT designation R10 -7) on the
       southbound approach of Route 611, north of the proposed driveway.
   Hilltop Road & Northern Site Driveway
       Design the driveway to prohibit left-turn ingress and right-turn ingress/egress via the use
       of a restrictive driveway angle and appropriate signage;
       Provide a stop sign (PennDOT designation R1-1) to control exiting traffic.
   Hilltop Road & Southern Site Driveway
       Restrict the driveway to ingress movements only;
       Provide adequate turning radii in order to facilitate safe and efficient ingress.
   Hilltop Road
       In an effort to discourage cut-through movements through the adjacent residential
       neighborhood, the applicant is agreeable to work with Township staff to implement
       restrictions on traffic flow on Hilltop Road via special signage. One recommendation
       could be in the form of restricting the flow of traffic on Hilltop Road during to the
       morning (7-9 A.M.) and evening (4-6 P.M.) commuter peak time periods, to a
       southbound, one-way flow, north of the existing daycare center driveway.

INTRODUCTION

Traffic Planning and Design, Inc. (TPD) has completed a Transportation Impact Study (TIS) for
the proposed Wawa and Bank in Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The
project site is located on the northwestern corner of the intersection of Route 611 (S.R. 0309) and
Baeder Road, as shown in Figure 1. The land use context of the site and surrounding area is
defined as a Town/Village Center per the Smart Transportation Guidebook, dated March 2008.
As shown in Figure 2, the proposed site will consist of the following:

       4,691 square foot (s.f.) Wawa Convenience Market with 6 fueling pumps (12 fueling
       positions);
       3,500 square foot (s.f.) Bank with Drive-Thru Facilities.

Opening Year for the proposed site is assumed to be 2014 and the Design Year is assumed to be
2019.

This report has been prepared in accordance with PennDOT's Policies and Procedures for
Transportation Impact Studies, dated January 28, 2009. The project scope and the extent of the
study area were confirmed with representatives of PennDOT, via preliminary coordination and a
preliminary review, dated July 3, 2012. All relevant correspondence pertaining to this project
has been included in Appendix A.

Internal Site Circulation
The internal site design provides for circuitous two-way traffic flow around the proposed
convenience market, fuel pumps and bank via aisle widths that are 24 feet minimum. Dead-end
parking appears to be minimized.

Site Access Locations
The proposed site will be served by four (4) driveway locations, as follows:

   One Limited-Access Driveway to Route 611 (S.R. 0611) that will prohibit left-turn egress via
   median;
   One Limited-Access Driveway to Route 611 (S.R. 0611) that will prohibit left-turn ingress
   and egress via median;
   One Limited-Access Driveway to Re-Aligned Hilltop Road that will prohibit left-turn ingress
   and right-turn ingress/egress via design and signage;
   One Limited-Access Driveway to Re-Aligned Hilltop Road that will prohibit egress via
   signage.

EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK

A field review of the existing roadway system in the study area was conducted. The existing
roadway characteristics within the study area are summarized in Table 1. Photographs of the
study area intersections are included in Appendix B.

Land Use Context
Chapter 4 of the Smart Transportation Guidebook, dated March 2008, provides guidance
pertaining to defining the land use context(s) for a given area. Based upon review of this
information, the land uses surrounding the proposed site best fit the Suburban Corridor
designation, as described below:
   Town/Village Center, "a mixed-use, high density area with building adjacent to the
   sidewalk, typically two to four stories tall with commercial operations on the ground floor
   and offices or residences above. Parallel parking usually occupies both sides of the street
   with parking lots behind the buildings. Important public buildings, such as the town hall or
   library, are provided special prominence."
Roadway Type
Chapter 5 of the Smart Transportation Guidebook, provides guidance pertaining to defining the
transportation context(s) for a given area. Comparing the existing condition roadway characteristics
to the various options presented in Table 5.1 of the Smart Transportation Guidebook, the study area
roadways best fit the following categories, as described below:
   Regional Arterial, traffic volumes of 10,000 to 40,000 vehicles per day, intersection spacing of
   660 to 1,320 feet, a desired operating speed of 30-55 mph, and a description as follows:
   "Roadways in this category would be considered "Principal Arterial" in traditional functional
   classification."
       Route 611.
   Community Arterial, traffic volumes of 5,000 to 25,000 vehicles per day, intersection spacing
   of 300 to 1,320 feet, a desired operating speed of 25-55 mph, and a description as follows:
   "often classified as Minor Arterial in traditional classification but may include road segments
   classified as Principal Arterial."

roadway types, and the associated design criteria are included in Appendix C.

Multi-Modal Facilities
Based on observations during field visits at the study area intersections, it was determined that
sidewalks are provided along both the Route 611 site frontages. The traffic signals at the
intersections of Route 611 with Baeder Road and The Fairway are equipped with pedestrian
crossing signals, pedestrian push buttons and/or pedestrian crosswalks.

SEPTA Rail Service is provided at the Noble Station on the eastern side of Route 611. SEPTA
Bus Route 55 provides service in the study area.

Crash Data Investigation
Crash data were obtained from PennDOT and Abington Township for the study area
intersections along Route 611 (S.R. 0611). PennDOT defines a reportable crash as follows, "A
reportable (crash) is one in which an injury or fatality occurs or if at least one of the vehicles
involved requires towing from the scene." Reportable crashes were tabulated for the three-year
time period beginning 01/01/2006 and ending 12/31/2010 (01/01/2007 through 07/17/2012 for
Abington Township). For a given intersection, PennDOT considers a crash occurrence of 5
reportable, correctable crashes over a continuous twelve-month period during the past three years
to be a threshold value, above which the intersection design should be reviewed to examine if
corrective measures can be taken to enhance safety. The number of reportable crashes at the
study area intersections is shown in Table 2.

BASE (NO-BUILD) CONDITIONS

Annual Background Growth
A background growth factor for the roadways in the study area was developed based on growth
factors for September 2012 to July 2013 obtained from the PennDOT Bureau of Planning and
Research (BPR). The PennDOT BPR suggests using a background growth trend factor of 0.73%
per year in Montgomery County for urban non-interstate roadways. As such, the background
growth factor was applied annually to yield overall growth percentages of 1.47% (0.73% per year,
compounded over two years) for the 2014 opening year and 5.22% (0.73% per year, compounded
over seven years) for the 2019 design year.

Nearby Proposed Development
Base (no-build) traffic conditions were calculated to include traffic volumes from proposed
developments, which, though not operating under existing conditions, may be operating by the
opening year (2014) and design year (2019) of the proposed development. The following nearby
planned development was specifically included in this study:

 Baederwood Shopping Center Redevelopment is a proposed re-development of the existing
 Baederwood Shopping Center (111 ksf) that will result in 166+ksf of commercial space and 266
 apartment units. The site is located on the northern side of The Fairway, east of Route 611. Trip
 distributions for this development were developed based on data provided in a traffic evaluation
 letter prepared by TPD, dated July 13, 2009.

The additional traffic volumes due to background growth and background developments were
added to the existing traffic data to produce 2014and 2019 Base (no-build) Condition traffic
volumes. Base condition volumes for the weekday A.M. and weekday P.M. peak hours are
illustrated in Figures 5-8. Trip distributions for the background development are provided in
Appendix E.

SCHEDULED ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS

Programmed Improvements
Based on a review of the PennDOT 12-Year Plan and the DVRPC Transportation Improvement
Program (TIP), there is one programmed roadway improvement in the vicinity of the proposed
site. This project is "MPMS# 16214: Old York Road Over SEPTA R3" and is described as
follows on the DVRPC Website:

   "The Old York Road bridge must be replaced with a new structure and is a three-span,
   concrete-encased, I-beam structure supported by reinforced concrete abutments and column
   pier bents. This structure carries five travel lanes (including one left turning lane) of PA
   Route 611 and two pedestrian sidewalks with a total structure width of 69' and structure
   length of approximately 113 feet. Signalized intersections are located at each approach to


                                               -5-
   the bridge. The existing bridge was rated poor in an inspection report performed in 2003.
   The overall bridge is deteriorating. The abutment has wide cracks, severe scale and large
   spalls. The superstructure over the loading platforms are exhibiting spalls and heavy scale.
   There were two small holes noted in the sidewalk on the bridge."

Funding for this improvement is projected to occur between 2015 and 2018. This project does
not appear to directly affect the capacity at the intersections in the study area.

Proposed Site Improvements
Based on preliminary analysis and preliminary correspondence with PennDOT, the following
intersection improvements are anticipated at the intersection of Route 611 (S.R. 0611) & Baeder
Road/Hilltop Road/Noble Plaza:

   Realignment of Hilltop Road to form a fifth leg at the signalized intersection of Route 611
   and Baeder Road/Noble Plaza. Hilltop Road will be aligned with Noble Plaza in such a
   fashion so that the two approaches will be able to operate simultaneously under the same
   signal phase;
   The existing eastbound Baeder Road approach (EB Left and EB Thru/Right) will be re-
   striped to allow left-turn movements from both lanes (EB Left and EB Left/Thru/Right). The
   Baeder Road approach will have its own separate signal phase to serve the heavy eastbound
   left-turn volume;
   Channelization of the eastbound Baeder Road and southbound Hilltop Road right-turn
   movements;
   Widening of the westbound Noble Plaza approach to provide two (2) egress lanes (WB Left
   and WB Thru/Right);
   Signal timing modifications.

Based on preliminary correspondence with PennDOT Staff, the Department appears favorable
with further investigation of these improvements. A conceptual design depicting these
improvements is included in Appendix F.

PROPOSED SITE ACCESS

The proposed site will be served by four (4) driveway locations, as follows:

   One Limited-Access Driveway to Route 611 (S.R. 0611) that will prohibit left-turn egress via
   median;
   One Limited-Access Driveway to Route 611 (S.R. 0611) that will prohibit left-turn ingress
   and egress via median;
   One Limited-Access Driveway to Re-Aligned Hilltop Road that will prohibit left-turn ingress
   and right-turn ingress/egress via design and signage;
   One Limited-Access Driveway to Re-Aligned Hilltop Road that will prohibit egress via
   signage.

Sight Distance Analysis
A sight distance analysis was prepared for the proposed site driveways. In general, recommended
safe sight distances depend upon the posted speed limit and roadway grades. The existing sight
distances at the proposed driveways were measured in accordance with PennDOT Publication 282
Highway Occupancy Permit Guidelines and compared to PennDOT's desirable sight distance
standard, which is identified in 67 PA Code Chapter 441.8(h), "Access to and Occupancy of
Highways by Driveways and Local Roads." In addition, measured sight distances at the proposed
driveways were compared to PennDOT's safe stopping sight distance standard, which is calculated
by the following equation:

                                   SSSD = 1.47VT + V2/[30(fg)]
                       SSSD = safe stopping sight distance (acceptable sight distance)
                       V = Vehicle Speed
                       T = Perception Reaction Time of Driver (2.5 seconds)
                       f = Coefficient of Friction for Wet Pavements
                       g = Percent of Roadway Grade Divided by 100

Tables 4-7 show the measured, desirable, acceptable (SSSD), and required sight distances at the site
driveways for vehicles entering and exiting the site.

TRIP GENERATION

The trip generation rates for the proposed site were obtained from the manual Trip Generation,
Ninth Edition, 2012, an Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Informational Report. For the
proposed site, Land Use Codes 853 (Convenience Market with Gasoline) and 912 (Drive-In Bank)
from Trip Generation was used to calculate the net increase in vehicular trips the development will
generate during the weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Table 8 shows the rates/equations and
directional percentages for the analyzed time periods.

TRIP DISTRIBUTION

Base Condition Traffic Re-Distribution
TPD developed a re-distribution of base condition traffic to account for the re-alignment of
Hilltop Road. This base condition re-distribution of traffic is shown in Figures 9-12.




                                                    -10-
New Trips
The distribution and assignment of new trips generated by the proposed site was based upon an
analysis of the following: (1) existing traffic patterns within the study area; (2) available routes
for travel; and (3) the proposed site driveway locations. The new trips for the proposed
development were distributed to the local roadway network based on the percentages shown in
Table 11.

Pass-By Trips
Pass-by trips were established based on the existing traffic patterns in the vicinity of the site and
the location and configuration of the site driveways. The percentages used for the distribution of
pass-by trips to the project site are shown below in Table 12.

PROJECTED (BUILD) CONDITION TRAFFIC VOLUMES

The site-generated trips for the proposed development and the re-distribution of base condition
traffic were added to the 2014 and 2019 Base (no-build) Condition traffic volumes to develop 2014
and 2019 Projected (build) Condition traffic volumes, as shown in Figures 15-18.

LEVELS OF SERVICE FOR AN INTERSECTION

For analysis of intersections, level of service is defined in terms of delay, which is a measure of
driver discomfort and frustration, fuel consumption, and lost travel time. LOS criteria is stated in
terms of control delay per vehicle for a one-hour analysis period. Control delay includes initial
deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. The criteria
are shown in Table 13. Delay, as it relates to level of service, is a complex measure and is
dependent upon a number of variables. For signalized intersections, these variables include the
quality of vehicle progression, the cycle length, the green time ratio, and the volume/capacity ratio
for the lane group in question. For unsignalized intersections, delay is related to the availability of
gaps in the flow of traffic on the major street and the driver's discretion in selecting an appropriate
gap for a particular movement from the minor street (straight across, left or right turn).

CAPACITY ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

Capacity analyses were conducted for the weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours at the study area
intersections. These analyses were conducted according to the methodologies contained in the
2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) using Synchro 7 software, a Trafficware product. The
following conditions were analyzed, as applicable:
   2012 Existing Conditions;
   2014 Base Conditions (Build-out year without development);
   2014 Projected Conditions (Build-out year with development);
   2019 Base Conditions (Design year without development);
   2019 Projected Conditions (Design year with development).


                                                            -12-
In addition, capacity analyses were conducted at the proposed site driveway intersections under the
projected conditions. The capacity analysis worksheets are included in Appendix I. The
PennDOT-approved signal plans are included in Appendix J.

PennDOT's Transportation Impact Study Guidelines outlined in Strike-Off Letter 470-09-4,
dated February 12, 2009 contain the following criteria regarding levels of service:
   Page 29 of the Guidelines states that if evaluation of the With Development Horizon Year
   Scenario to the Without Development Horizon Year Scenario indicates that the overall
   intersection level of service has dropped, the applicant will be required to mitigate the level
   of service if the increase in overall intersection delay is greater than 10-seconds. If the
   overall intersection delay increase is less than or equal to 10-seconds, mitigation of the
   intersection will not be required.
   Page 29 of the Guidelines states that for mitigation scenarios, applicants are expected to
   mitigate the overall intersection LOS to the original Without Development LOS; the 10-
   second delay variance is not applied to mitigation scenarios. Applicants may be required to
   address available storage and queue lengths at critical movements or approaches even if the
   overall LOS requirements are met.
   Page 31 of the Guidelines states that if signalization is the preferred alternative for
   mitigation, overall intersection LOS C in rural areas and LOS D in urban areas is acceptable.
   Page 31 of the Guidelines states new signalized or unsignalized intersection(s) established to
   serve as access to the development shall be designed to operate at minimum LOS C for rural
   areas, and minimum LOS D for urban areas.
It should be note that, based on PennDOT TIS Criteria, the traffic signal timings at the
signalized intersections in the study area were optimized under base conditions for subsequent
projected conditions.

LEVELS OF SERVICE IN THE STUDY AREA

Levels of service (LOS) at the study area intersections for the weekday A.M. and P.M. peak
hours are summarized in Figures 19-28. Level of service (LOS) matrices for the study area
intersections are shown in Tables 14-15.

As shown in Tables 14-15, with the development of the proposed site and with the site-related
improvements, the study area intersections will satisfy PennDOT LOS Criteria during the
weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

95TH PERCENTILE QUEUE ANALYSIS

Queue analyses were conducted at the signalized study area intersections along Route 611 (S.R.
0611) using Synchro 7 software. For this analysis, the 95th percentile queue is defined as the queue
length that is exceeded in 5% of the signal cycles. As an example, for a signal with a 90-second
cycle, this means that the 95th percentile queue length will be exceeded during 2 of the 40 signal
cycles that occur during the peak hour. The queue analysis results are summarized in Table 16 for
the analyzed peak hours.

PARKING ANALYSIS

TPD conducted manual parking counts at two similar Wawa's located in Montgomery County and
Bucks County to determine the parking generation for the sites. The counts were conducted at the
following locations:

       Colmar ­ 119 Bethlehem Pike, Store #8018;
       Quakertown ­ 1095 S. West End Boulevard, Store #272

These parking counts were conducted during the following time periods:

       Weekday A.M. peak hour (7:00-9:00 A.M.);
       Weekday P.M. peak hour (4:00-6:00 P.M.).

The parking counts were conducted on the following days:

       Thursday, June 10, 2010;
       Tuesday, June 15, 2010.

Table 17 shows the maximum number of occupied spaces at each of the Wawa's for the study
peak hours and the associated rate based on the number of fueling positions for each Wawa.

As shown in bold in Table 17, the peak parking demand rate was 9.39 parking spaces per ksf
(Colmar), which occurred during the weekday A.M. peak hour. Applying this rate to the proposed
4.691 ksf yields a peak parking demand of 44 parking spaces for the proposed Abington site.

Since the parking counts indicate a proposed peak parking demand of 44 parking spaces (based on
square footage), it is TPD's opinion that the proposed 58 parking spaces to be provided at the
proposed Wawa will be more than sufficient to accommodate the parking demand for the site. It
should be noted that the parking rate calculated was based on the total spaces occupied at the
existing sites, including the fueling positions. In addition, the peak number of spaces occupied, as
shown in Table 17, was 55, which is less than the 58 spaces proposed.


                                                -19-
The parking count worksheets are included in Appendix K. It should be noted that the parking
results utilized in Table 17 also include observations pertaining to single-unit trucks and
landscaping vehicles. Based on these field observations, TPD observed no circulation issues that
resulted from parked trucks or parked landscaping vehicles.

TRUCK ACCESS/TURNS FROM ROUTE 611

TPD completed a truck turning template using the AutoTurn Software for the anticipated heavy
vehicle from Route 611. Based on this analysis, it is TPD's opinion, the anticipated heavy vehicle
will be able to access the site from Route 611 in a safe and efficient manner. Truck turn plans are
included in Appendix L.

RECOMMENDATIONS

TPD has made the following recommendations in relation to the proposed Wawa/Bank in Abington
Township:

   Route 611 & Baeder Road/Hilltop Road
       Realignment of Hilltop Road to form a fifth leg at the signalized intersection of Route
       611 and Baeder Road/Noble Plaza. Hilltop Road should be aligned with Noble Plaza in
       such a fashion so that the two approaches will be able to operate simultaneously under
       the same signal phase;
       The existing eastbound Baeder Road through/right lane should be re-striped to a
       left/through/right lane configuration, in order to allow left-turn movements from both
       eastbound lanes onto NB Route 611;
       With the proposed dual left turn configuration on eastbound Baeder Road, the traffic
       signal should be re-designed to provide a separate phase;
       Provide channelization for the eastbound Baeder Road and southbound Hilltop Road
       right-turn movements;
       Widening of the westbound Noble Plaza approach to provide two (2) egress lanes (WB
       Left and WB Thru/Right);
       Provide signal timing modifications during the weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours.
   Route 611 & The Fairway/Harte Road
       Optimize traffic signal timings during the weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours.
   Route 611 & Northern Site Driveway
       Provide a stop sign (PennDOT designation R1-1) to control exiting traffic;
       Provide adequate turning radii in order to facilitate safe and efficient ingress/egress;
       Provide a northbound left-turn lane on Route 611 within the existing median. This lane
       length should be maximized along the site frontage.



                                                -20-
   Route 611 & Southern Site Driveway
       Provide a stop sign (PennDOT designation R1-1) to control exiting traffic;
       Provide adequate turning radii in order to facilitate safe and efficient ingress/egress;
       Provide a "Do Not Block Intersection" sign (PennDOT designation R10 -7) on the
       southbound approach of Route 611, north of the proposed driveway.
   Hilltop Road & Northern Site Driveway
       Design the driveway to prohibit left-turn ingress and right-turn ingress/egress via the use
       of a restrictive driveway angle and appropriate signage;
       Provide a stop sign (PennDOT designation R1-1) to control exiting traffic.
   Hilltop Road & Southern Site Driveway
       Restrict the driveway to ingress movements only;
       Provide adequate turning radii in order to facilitate safe and efficient ingress.
   Hilltop Road
   In an effort to discourage cut-through movements through the adjacent residential
   neighborhood, the applicant is agreeable to work with Township staff to implement
   restrictions on traffic flow on Hilltop Road via special signage. One recommendation could
   be in the form of restricting the flow of traffic on Hilltop Road during to the morning (7-9
   A.M.) and evening (4-6 P.M.) commuter peak time periods, to a southbound, one-way flow,
   north of the existing daycare center driveway.


CONCLUSIONS

Based on the results of the transportation impact study, TPD offers the following conclusions:
   The project site is located on the northwestern corner of the intersection of Route 611 (S.R.
   0309) and Baeder Road. The proposed site will consist of the following:
       4,691 square foot (s.f.) Wawa Convenience Market with 6 fueling pumps (12 fueling
       positions);
       3,500 square foot (s.f.) Bank with Drive-Thru Facilities.
   The proposed site will be served by four (4) driveway locations, as follows:
       One Limited-Access Driveway to Route 611 (S.R. 0611) that will prohibit left-turn egress
       via median;
       One Limited-Access Driveway to Route 611 (S.R. 0611) that will prohibit left-turn
       ingress and egress via median;
       One Limited-Access Driveway to Re-Aligned Hilltop Road that will prohibit left-turn
       ingress and right-turn egress via design and signage;
       One Limited-Access Driveway to Re-Aligned Hilltop Road that will prohibit egress via
       signage.


                                                -21-
   All proposed driveway location sight distances will exceed all applicable sight distance
   criteria.
   The proposed development will generate approximately 74 new trips during the weekday
   A.M. peak hour and 102 new trips during the weekday P.M. peak hour.
   Under the 2014 and 2019 Projected Conditions, with implementation of the site-related
   recommendations, all intersections within the study area will satisfy PennDOT LOS Criteria
   during weekday A.M. and P.M.
   With the implementation of the site-related recommendations, it is TPD's opinion that the
   construction of the proposed development will not adversely affect the health, safety, and
   welfare of the community from a traffic engineering perspective.

Greg, two things: Can you further refine the Upper Merion Sketch to show the actual location of the Target
Driveway. You mentioned it was to be moved slightly to the south. Second, we are in favor of an access on Hilltop
located appropriately such that site traffic can use it to access the five points signal (if approved). We can discuss
further tomorrow. thanks.

Subject: Upper Merion and Abington Wawas

As requested, I have revised the Upper Merion plan to account for the following:

              ·   increase of the ingress radius
              ·   reduction of the internal island to permit better alignment and queuing.
              ·   turning templates. I used WB-50 trucks so passenger vehicles should be fine also. This can be
                  tweaked further if and when we get to a signal installation.

For the Abington site, I have enclosed a concept plan the indicates Hilltop Road aligning with the opposite
driveway on Rt 611 (with some adjustment of that driveway too). I have to correct what I stated earlier
today. Baeder Road and the existing driveway operate during the same phase in lieu of a split phase
operation. Therefore, adding Hilltop Road to the equation will necessitate an additional phase. We can discuss
further after tomorrow's meeting in Upper Merion.

As always, we appreciate your valuable time and input for these two projects.

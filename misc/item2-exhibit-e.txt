EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Minagar & Associates, Inc. has prepared the following traffic study report summarizing
the results of a traffic impact analysis completed for the proposed remodeling and
expansion of the existing Bernard's Wine in the City of Calabasas, California. The
proposed site improvements will be located at the existing wine gallery located on the
south side of Calabasas Road, just west of the US-101/Valley Circle Boulevard
interchange in the Old Town Calabasas Specific Plan Area.

The proposed project consists of remodeling an existing one-story art/wine gallery retail
space into a dining room with 68 seats and kitchen space, and adding a new 2,400
square foot outdoor lounge/dining area.

As part of Minagar & Associates, Inc.'s traffic analysis, the following scenarios were
evaluated:

    Existing Conditions (Year 2013) - Based on existing weekday traffic counts
    collected at four (4) major signalized intersections in the project study area.

    Cumulative (2014) Base Conditions - Reflects estimated baseline traffic
    conditions of the projected opening year of the project. Incorporates a
    conservative 2% ambient growth rate applied to the existing background traffic,
    compounded annually, plus additional traffic cumulatively generated by nearby
    pending and approved developments identified by the City of Calabasas.

    Cumulative (2014) Plus Project Conditions - Represents the
    impact/addition of the proposed project's traffic on Cumulative (2014) Base
    traffic conditions.

Potential significant project and/or cumulative impacts are identified and summarized in
Section 4.2.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 -- Project Background

Project Description. The project applicant is proposing to renovate an existing one-
story wine gallery retail space to add a bar and restaurant use. The proposed
improvements include the addition of a 68-seat indoor dining room area with kitchen
space, and a 2,400-SF outdoor dining/lounge area.

The existing Art/Wine Gallery is located on the south side of Calabasas Road between
Park Granada and Mulholland Drive in the Old Town Calabasas area, just west of the
Calabasas Road and Valley Circle Boulevard interchanges with US-101. The existing
gallery will remain in operation on-site and the proposed bar and restaurant use will be
added during a single one-year construction phase, slated to open in 2014.

Parking. In addition to the proposed on-site improvements, the Project will also provide
an off-site valet parking service to accommodate the project site's total parking demand.
The off-site parking lot contains a total of 103 spaces and is located at an existing office
building at 23586 Calabasas Road. Since the proposed project improvements will
eliminate the existing five (5) existing parking spaces located on-site, the off-site lot will
serve to carry the art/wine gallery's total parking demand. Staff parking is included in the
proposed restaurant's parking requirement.

As discussed in the parking survey and utilization report prepared by Minagar &
Associates, Inc., due to the proposed staggered hours of operation between the gallery
and office building, the shared parking agreement will result in a parking surplus of 24%
(25 spaces) or more during the peak day/hour on Friday at 5:00PM.

Access. Vehicular access to the 23538 Calabasas Road site will be limited to deliveries
and emergency access only, via the existing 10-foot driveway on Calabasas Road; no
project traffic will be permitted to access the site from the driveway. The Project will
utilize the existing loading zone as a valet drop-off/pick-up area. The proposed outdoor

dining area and renovations will require the removal of the five existing off-street
parking spaces located behind the building; as a result, the existing vehicular access to
the rear of the building will be eliminated. Off-site valet parking lot access will continue
to be provided by the existing two-way driveway and indoor/outdoor parking area at
23586 Calabasas Road.

Site Use. General site use will be limited before 5:00PM each weekday, and may include
a few staff members preparing to open to store during the early off-peak hours. Staff
parking is included in the total restaurant parking requirement, and will occur in the off-
site lot. Proposed hours of operation will be 5:00PM to 9:00PM Sunday through
Thursday, and 5:00PM to 1:00AM on Fridays and Saturdays. All deliveries will occur
prior to the restaurant's opening on each business day.

Table 1 below outlines the project's general information.

Current Zoning. The project site is located within the City of Calabasas' Commercial
Old Town Zone (CT) and Old Town Calabasas Master Plan Area. The project includes
new land uses (i.e., indoor/outdoor restaurant dining); however, it does not request any
changes to the existing zoning designation.

1.2 -- Analysis Methodology

Project Study Area. The traffic impact study area is comprised of four (4) existing
signalized intersections selected and approved for evaluation in collaboration with City
of Calabasas staff, and consistent with the Los County Congestion Management Program
(LACCMP). A list of the four study intersections and respective jurisdictions is provided
as follows:

       1. Calabasas Road & Park Granada - City of Calabasas
       2. Calabasas Road & US-101 Southbound On/Off-Ramps - City of Calabasas
       3. Valley Circle Boulevard & US-101 Northbound On/Off-Ramps - L.A. County
       4. Calabasas Road & Mulholland Drive - L.A. County


A map depicting the study locations and lane configurations for each of the four
intersections with respect to the proposed project site and surrounding area is provided
below in Figure 3.

scenarios were evaluated in this traffic analysis:

    Existing Conditions (Year 2013) - Reflects the existing traffic counts
    collected at each study intersection by Minagar staff on typical Saturday/weekday
    peak periods in September 2013, between the hours of 8:00AM and 1:30PM.

    Existing Conditions (Year 2013) Plus Project - Consists of adding traffic
    volumes generated by the proposed project to the existing (2013) traffic
    conditions.

    Opening Year Conditions (2014), Without Project - Reflects the
    estimated baseline traffic conditions upon the projected opening year of the
    project. Incorporates a 2% ambient growth rate applied to the existing
    background traffic, compounded annually, plus additional traffic cumulatively
    generated by nearby pending and approved developments.

    Opening Year Conditions (2014), Plus Project - Consists of adding project
    traffic volumes to the Opening Year (2014) baseline traffic conditions.

Each of the above four scenarios were evaluated during the weekday peak hour period
(i.e., Saturday mid-day). Intersection turning movement counts conducted by Minagar
for each intersection are provided in Appendix A.

Level of Service Analysis and Criteria. Traffic impact guidelines from the City of
Calabasas were utilized to conduct the level of service (LOS) analyses. Per City
guidelines, Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) methodology was used to determine
the LOS at each of the four study intersections. The ICU methodology compares the
volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios of conflicting turn movements at the intersection, sums
these critical conflicting v/c ratios for each intersection approach, and determines the
overall ICU. The resulting ICU is expressed in terms of level of service ranging from
LOS "A" representing free-flow activity, and LOS "F" representing overcapacity
operation. ICU calculation summaries for each intersection and scenario, and the
evaluation parameters adopted by the City are included in the analysis.

In accordance with pre-project meetings with the City of Calabasas, the following ICU
parameters were used:

       Per lane flow rate capacity of 1,800 vehicles per hour
       No right-turn on red credit
       No yellow clearance (lost time) factor
       10% dual left-turn penalty
       Conservative ambient growth factor of 2% per year was used in evaluating projected
       traffic conditions. With the assumed Project build-out date of 2014, the existing
       2013 traffic volumes were adjusted upwards by a factor of 1.02 to reflect this
       area-wide regional growth.

The Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) intersection analysis methodology is
consistent with the City of Calabasas and Congestion Management Program (CMP)
analysis requirements, and was applied by Minagar using Synchro-8.0 software to calculate
the LOS for each intersection. An LOS of "C" is considered to be the minimal level of
service desired within the City of Calabasas. The LOS C standard applies to all City
facilities within the City of Calabasas. LOS D is the minimal level of service for freeway
interchanges. Table 2 summarizes the ICU LOS criteria.

All supporting data on the intersection LOS determined in the traffic analysis are
included under Appendix B.

    Service             ICU                                     Description
                                     At LOS A, there are no cycles that are fully loaded, and few
                                     are even close to loaded. No approach phase is fully utilized
                                     by traffic and no vehicle waits longer than one red indication.
       A              < 0.61         Typically, the approach appears quite open, turning
                                     movements are easily made, and nearly all drivers find
                                     freedom of operation.
                                     LOS B represents stable operation. An occasional approach
                                     phase is fully utilized and a substantial number are approaching
       B           0.61 ­ 0.70       full use. Many drivers begin to feel somewhat restricted with
                                     platoons of vehicles.
                                     In LOS C stable operation continues. Full signal cycle loading is
                                     still intermittent, but more frequent. Occasionally drivers may
       C           0.71 ­ 0.80       have to wait though more than one red signal indication, and
                                     back-ups may develop behind turning vehicles.
                                     LOS D encompasses a zone of increasing restriction,
                                     approaching instability. Delays to approaching vehicles may be
                                     substantial during short peaks within the peak period, but
       D           0.81 ­ 0.90       enough cycles with lower demand occur to permit periodic
                                     clearance of developing queues, thus preventing excessive
                                     back-ups.
                                     LOS E represents the most vehicles that any particular
                                     intersection approach can accommodate. At capacity (V/C =
        E          0.91 ­ 1.00       1.00) there may be long queues of vehicles waiting upstream
                                     of the intersection and delays may be great (up to several
                                     signal cycles).
                                     LOS F represents jammed conditions. Back-ups from locations
                                     downstream or on the cross street may restrict or prevent
                                     movement of vehicles out of the approach under
        F             > 1.00         consideration; hence, volumes carried are not predictable, V/C
                                     values are highly variable, because full utilization of the
                                     approach may be prevented by outside conditions.
                 Represents overcapacity conditions by 0-9% (LOS G) and >9% (LOS H) during the
     G, H        peak hours; long queues are common and motorists may choose alternate routes.

    Cumulative projects: The City of Calabasas staff provided Minagar a
    comprehensive list of approved/pending development projects in the City of
    Calabasas as well as nearby areas in the City of Hidden Hills, Unincorporated
    Los Angeles County, and the City of Los Angeles. Cumulative project trips were
    estimated by using the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) latest Trip
    Generation, 8th Edition. A master list of cumulative developments as provided by
    the City of Calabasas is attached in Appendix C.

1.3 -- Traffic Impact Significance Criteria Thresholds

City of Calabasas Significant Impact Threshold: Traffic impacts due to the proposed
project would be considered significant if the level of service an intersection(s) within
the City of Calabasas were to fall below LOS C for City intersections (LOS D for
freeway interchanges) due to the addition of project trips. For City intersections
currently operating at deficient LOS D conditions or worse, the following significant
impact criteria apply:

                                        TABLE 3
                  City of Calabasas Traffic Impact Standards:
           Allowable Project-Related Increase in Traffic at Deficient Intersections
   Existing or Future            Volume-to-Capacity                Maximum Peak Hour
   Intersection LOS                        (V/C)                         V/C Increase
         LOS D                          0.81 ­ 0.90                           0.010
          LOS E                         0.91 ­ 1.00                           0.006
          LOS F                            >1.00                              0.003

County of Los Angeles Significant Impact Threshold: The County of Los Angeles'
established thresholds would apply to study intersections located within unincorporated
L.A. County. The County considers impacts to an intersection when traffic generated by
a project considered alone or cumulatively with other related projects, when added to
existing traffic volumes, exceeds certain capacity thresholds for an intersection or
roadway. For intersections, this impact is considered significant if the project-related
increase in the volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio equals or exceeds the thresholds shown
in the following table.

If an existing facility is operating at less than the appropriate target LOS, the existing
LOS should be maintained, and the Project must provide fair share payments to fund
future improvements that will mitigate for the Project's contributing portion of any
potential cumulative impacts. These mitigation requirements are consistent with the
City's General Plan policies, and thus do not impose any prohibition against Project
approval.


2. EXISTING CONDITIONS

2.1 -- Existing Roadway System

U.S. Highway 101. Regional access to the project site is provided primarily by U.S. Route
101, which extends along the Pacific Coast between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Within the City of Calabasas the freeway is six lanes wide and provides the principal
route between Calabasas and the Cities of Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and Ventura to
the north, and the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles to the south. Primary access
between US-101 and the project site from the east is provided via the Mulholland
Drive/Valley Circle Boulevard interchange, located just outside the City's easterly
boundary in the County of Los Angeles. From the west, regional access is provided via
the US-101 South interchange at Calabasas Road. Ramp intersections at both
interchanges are currently signalized.

Calabasas Road is a primary arterial which runs parallel to US-101 through the City of
Calabasas. The roadway varies between two lanes (undivided) and four lanes (divided by
center median), providing major and alternative east/west access through the Old Town
area of the City, as well as direct access to the subject project site on the south side of
the Calabasas Road. Major signals on Calabasas Road in the vicinity of the project
include Parkway Calabasas, Park Granada, US-101 South On/Off-Ramps, and Mulholland
Drive/Valley Circle Boulevard. To the east of Mulholland Drive Calabasas Road becomes
Avenue San Luis,

Mulholland Drive is a four to five-lane primary arterial providing north/south access
along the easterly city boundary to the US-101 Freeway. To the north of Calabasas

Road Mulholland Drive becomes Valley Circle Boulevard. Freeway ramps on the north
side of the Valley Circle Boulevard interchange provide access to and from the US-101
North Freeway. There is a freeway entrance to US-101 South on the south side of the
interchange, accessible only to northbound vehicles on Valley Circle Drive. Southbound
vehicles on Valley Circle Drive are able access the US-101 via dedicated on-ramp lanes
from the intersection at Calabasas Road.

2.2 -- Existing Traffic Volumes

Intersection turning movement counts (TMC) were field-counted during weekday peak
hours by Minagar staff at each of the four study intersections. Traffic data collection
time frames were determined in collaboration with the City of Calabasas, and included
the peak morning and afternoon commuter hours of 7:00-9:00AM and 4:00-6:00PM in
mid-January 2013. Once collected, the traffic count data was processed and organized to
extract the single peak-hour traffic movements for each intersection. Average peak hour
periods occurred between 7:45-8:45AM and 4:00-5:00PM.

Figures 4A and 4B illustrate the weekday peak hour traffic volumes collected in the
field during the AM and PM hours, respectively, at each of the four signalized study
intersections. Traffic count data sheets are provided in Appendix A.

2.3 -- Existing (Year 2013) Intersection Operations

Minagar & Associates, Inc. used the existing collected field data, including traffic volume
counts, existing lane geometrics, signal timing/phasing parameters and other
intersectional operational assumptions to develop a traffic analysis model of the study
intersection network within the Synchro-8 software program. Existing intersection
volume-to-capacity ratios and subsequent LOS were determined using the program's
ICU analysis module, as summarized in Table 5 and presented on detailed calculation
worksheets in Appendix B.

The results of the existing LOS analysis indicate that all of the existing study
intersections are currently operating at deficient ICU levels of service during the
weekday AM and PM peak hours. Only the intersection of Calabasas Road at Park
Granada is performing at acceptable LOS B (v/c ~ 0.602) during the AM peak hour.

2.4 -- Proposed Project Traffic

The proposed project traffic was estimated using standard methods for trip generation,
trip distribution and trip assignment, including: estimation of project trips generated by
the proposed wine gallery remodel and expansion during the AM and PM weekday peak
hours; distribution and direction of trips accessing the project site; and assignment of
the projected trips on the surrounding roadway system.

Trip Generation. Trip generation rates used in this analysis were established by applying
standard and current data compiled and published by the Institute of Transportation of
Engineers' (ITE) latest Trip Generation manual, 8th Edition (2008). The ITE code and land
use designations applicable to the proposed project is ITE Land Use Code #531 -
Quality Restaurant. Based on these trip rates, the project is anticipated to generate 4
additional trips during the AM peak hour and 36 trips during the PM peak hour.

                          TABLE 6 ­ Project Trip Generation
                                                 Trip Rates / Generation

Total Trip Generation:                      4 peak hour trips      36 peak hour trips


Trip Distribution/Assignment. The project traffic was assigned to the roadway network
using directional distribution based on an analysis of existing AM and PM peak hour
volumes and patterns on the surrounding transportation network, local and regional site
access during the expected hours of operation, consideration of the City's Circulation
Plan, a comparison of trip patterns of other nearby and similar retail/restaurant projects
in the City of Calabasas (particularly in the Old Town area), assignment to the
surrounding residential zones and general proximity to the project site. The project trip
distribution pattern is depicted on Figure 6, and includes regional and local access
distribution percentages and directions at each of the four study intersections. Project
trip generation during the AM and PM weekday peak hours is shown on Figure 7.

2.5 -- Existing (Year 2013) Plus Project Intersection Operations

Existing (Year 2013) Plus Project Conditions represent near-term traffic conditions that
are expected to occur with the addition of peak-hour traffic generated by the proposed
project. Evaluating this scenario illustrates the speculative impact of the project on the
existing transportation system, apart from cumulative developments and other
background traffic growth impacts. Existing Plus Project intersection volume-to-capacity
ratios and LOS were determined by assigning the AM and PM project trips to the
Existing Year (2013) traffic model. The results are summarized in Table 7.

The results of the existing LOS analysis indicate that all of the existing study
intersections are currently operating at deficient ICU levels of service during the
weekday AM and PM peak hours. Only the intersection of Calabasas Road at Park
Granada is performing at acceptable LOS B (v/c ~ 0.602) during the AM peak hour.

3. FUTURE CONDITIONS

3.1 -- Background Traffic Growth

Under the Cumulative Base Year (2014) Without Project Conditions, the traffic analysis
has considered an ambient growth of 2% per year to account for regional and local
traffic growth between Existing 2013 and Year 2014 baseline scenarios. As per the City's
direction, this future background growth is intended to conservatively approximate
regional and local traffic, socioeconomic and other factors not reflected by the
development of cumulative projects leading up to the opening year of the proposed
project.

3.2 -- Cumulative Development Traffic

Cumulative projects evaluated the analysis included all reasonably foreseeable
development projects identified by the City of Calabasas which are pending, approved,
currently being processed, or under construction near the project site and study
intersections. City staff provided Minagar & Associates, Inc. a comprehensive list of
cumulative development projects from current applications and projects undergoing
development within the Cities of Calabasas and Hidden Hills, and the County of Los
Angeles. The cumulative development project list is included in Appendix C.

As with the proposed project traffic, cumulative development project trips were
evaluated using a combination of existing available study reports prepared by other
consultants, as well as ITE Trip Generation rates for data not readily available.
Cumulative trip distribution patterns were similarly collected from current traffic
studies, or determined on a stratified basis of similar land use types and trip zones, such
as Retail/Commercial, Industrial/Warehouse, Residential and Office use. The traffic
generation for each use was then aggregated into a cumulative layer and used to
determine potential cumulative traffic impacts without the proposed project (see
Section 3.3).

3.3 -- Cumulative (2014) Base Conditions

Minagar & Associates, Inc. performed a future intersection operations assessment by
comparing the Cumulative Year (2014) traffic conditions with and without the project.
Under the first of these two scenarios, the Base Conditions include existing traffic (Year
2013), plus a 2% annual traffic growth to the project opening year of 2014, plus
cumulative/related development project traffic. Figures 5A and 5B illustrate the AM and
PM peak hour traffic volumes at the four study intersection under the Cumulative (2013)
Base Conditions.

As shown below in Table 8 the resulting LOS analysis indicate that with the annual
ambient traffic growth and addition of nearby cumulative projects, all of the study
intersections will continue to operate at deficient levels of service (LOS D or worse),
except for Calabasas Road at Park Granada during the AM peak hour (acceptable LOS
B).

3.4 -- Cumulative (2014) Plus Project Conditions

The second of the two future forecast scenarios is comprised of adding the estimated
weekday AM/PM peak hour project trips to the Cumulative (2014) Base conditions.
Figures 8A and 8B illustrate the Cumulative Year (2014) Plus Project traffic volumes on
the surrounding study area.

As shown below in Table 9, the LOS analysis reveals no significant change in the
anticipated intersection capacity at each study intersections. All four signalized
intersections will continue to operate below the City of Calabasas' acceptable threshold
of C or better during the Cumulative Year (2014) conditions, with and without the
project. The intersection of Calabasas Road at Park Granada remains as the only
exception and will maintain an acceptable LOS B (v/c ~ 0.623) during the AM peak hour.

4. PROJECT IMPACT ASSESSMENT

4.1 -- Significant Project Impacts

Study area intersections found to be significantly impacted during one or more peak
hours or target years are identified in Table 10. The analysis compares the change in
ICU (v/c) and level of service (LOS) using the City's and County's significance criteria
for each study intersection as appropriate, to determine cumulative and/or direct
project impacts.

As shown on Table 10, all of the four study intersections are projected to continue
operating at currently deficient Year 2013 levels of service into the project's build-out
year of 2014. Based on the established significance criteria, all four intersections would
be impacted by the combined traffic of surrounding development projects together with
the subject project.

Although the combined addition of ambient traffic growth, related project traffic and
proposed project trips, would cause adverse impacts at each of the study intersection
(as summarized below), the proposed wine gallery remodeling and expansion project
will not in itself significantly cause any direct traffic impacts at any of the four
intersections or surrounding transportation system.

              Project Impact:                 No Impact (+0.003 PM)


    (4) Calabasas Road & Mulholland Drive
              Project Impact:                 No Impact (+0.001 PM)


4.2 -- Mitigation

As described in Section 4.1, the proposed project would not result in any significant
traffic impacts; therefore, no mitigation is necessary. The project would be required to
participate in the Citywide Traffic Mitigation Fee Program and pay a development fee
based on the rate of $3.00 per square foot of commercial space or latest approved rate
per the City's current development fee schedule. As proposed, the fee at 3,219 total
square feet to develop the proposed new outdoor dining area, restrooms and renovate
the existing indoor dining area and accessory building areas as new kitchen space is
$9,657.00, with a final amount based on the approved square footage of use.

5. CONCLUSIONS

The proposed project consists of remodeling an existing one-story art/wine gallery
office space into a dining room with 68 indoor seats with kitchen space, and adding a
new 2,200 square foot outdoor lounge area. The anticipated completion year of the
project is 2014.

Four (4) intersections were analyzed under AM and PM weekday peak hour operations.
Based on an analysis of existing weekday morning and afternoon peak hour traffic
conditions, all four study intersections were determined to be currently operating
below the City's standard acceptable minimum level of service threshold of LOS "C".
With the addition of ambient traffic growth between 2013 and 2014, plus the addition of
peak hour vehicle trips resulting from other nearby cumulative development projects, all
four intersections will continue to operate at this deficient LOS D or worse.

The proposed project is estimated to generate 4 AM peak hour trips and 36 PM peak
hour trips. An analysis of Year 2014 "Plus Project" conditions, as documented in
Sections 3.4 and 4.1 of this report, revealed that the study intersections would be
adversely impacted by cumulative developments in the area; however, the addition of
project traffic from the proposed wine/art gallery expansion would not result in any
significant traffic impacts at any of the four signalized study intersections.

Executive Summary




EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The City of Monterey conducted this Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) to objectively evaluate two
alternatives for the intersection control form at the SR 68 (Holman Highway)/SR 1 Ramp Termini
intersection. The two alternatives evaluated were a traffic signal and a roundabout.

The evaluation was based primarily on traffic operations (2015 and 2030) including service life and life
cycle cost considerations, as well as geometrics and other design considerations. Key findings include:

          The roundabout intersection alternative was found to perform better than the traffic signal
          alternative in almost all criteria.
          The operations of the traffic signal were found to be unacceptable in the 2015 and 2030 design
          years
          The 4-lane widening of SR 68 is required to accommodate the proposed ultimate 2030 traffic
          signal configuration.
          The roundabout alternative can be constructed independently of the future 4-lane widening of
          SR 68.
The geometric design and safety considerations favored the roundabout alternative. The roundabout
was found to accommodate all traffic movements for the design vehicle, where the traffic signal limits
some movements for trucks. The roundabout alternative allows for less complex guide signing through
the intersection, where the traffic signal requires specific lane designations to reach destinations in the
eastbound and southbound directions. Additionally, the roundabout alternative has better expected
safety performance than the traffic signal alternative.

Based on the results, the City of Monterey recommends the roundabout alternative be moved forward
as the preferred alternative for the SR 68/SR 1 Southbound Ramp Termini intersection. As the
roundabout alternative is moved forward into PS&E, the City of Monterey will look for opportunities to
coordinate with Caltrans and other agencies to refine and optimize the proposed concepts within the
project contextual environment.

Project Description




PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) compares and evaluates alternatives for the intersection
control of SR 68 (Holman Highway) with the SR 1 Southbound Ramps. The general location of the
intersection is shown on the vicinity map in Figure 1. This ICE is a supplement to the Project Report (PR)
performed for the Holman Highway Widening Project, which evaluated alternatives for SR 68 from the
Community Hospital of Monterey Peninsula (CHOMP) to the SR 68/SR 1 Junction. The preferred
alternative from the PR is a full four-lane widening of SR 68 with a five-legged signalized intersection at
the SR 68/SR 1 Ramp Termini.

The approved PR for the Holman Highway Widening Project outlined that project will be constructed in
three separate phases as follows:

          Phase 1 would construct CHOMP improvements at the SR 68 and CHOMP entrance intersection.
          This intersection improvement is required as part of the mitigation for the CHOMP expansion.
          Phase 2 would construct the southbound on-ramp and modify the Pebble Beach Entrance. This
          improvement is required as part of the mitigation for the Pebble Beach Development Project.
          Phase 3 would be the remainder of the project, which the City of Monterey will take the lead
          and will be the agency responsible for final design and construction.
This ICE is meant to further explore intersection control alternatives at the SR 68/SR 1 Ramp Termini
intersection for implementation in Phase 2 of the project as outlined below.

Two project alternatives are described in this ICE:

          Signalized Intersections
          Roundabout Intersections

PROJECT STATUS
The Project Report (PR) was approved in March 2009 for the signal alternative identified in the Holman
Highway Widening Project (RU-06-234 EA 448000).

Phase 1 of the project has been constructed as part of the mitigations for the CHOMP expansion.

Phase 2 of the project is scheduled for construction in 2015.

Phase 3 of the project is not funded and a timeline for construction is unknown at this time.

At this time, a Roundabout Report of Conceptual Approval will be required for consideration of each
roundabout alternative in the project report. However, the review and approval process for
roundabouts on the state highway system will likely be changed in the Summer of 2013.

A Supplemental Project Report will serve as approval of the "selected" alternative.

Project Description


Subsequent to the PR approval, a Final Environmental Impact Report for Pebble Beach Company
projects was approved April 2012. The roundabout concept for Phase 2 improvements was identified
as a mitigation measure.


FUNDING
Phase 2 of the Holman Highway Widening Project is funded by Pebble Beach Company (PBC) as part of
the mitigation for the Pebble Beach Development Project. The estimated share of PBC funds from the
PR was $1,705,000. Currently, PBC's share is approximately $4,000,000.

Additional funding for the roundabout alternative is provided through an AB 2766 grant from the
Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District (MBUAPCD) to the City of Monterey and the
Transportation Authority for Monterey County (TAMC). The City of Monterey grant is $350,000 for plan
preparation and approval. The TAMC grant is $50,000 for outreach and education. The MBUAPCD
grants can only be used for the development, approval, and construction of the roundabout alternative.

The capital outlay support, right-of-way, and construction components of the project are preliminary
estimates.


SOURCE OF ROUNDABOUT CONCEPT
The basis for the roundabout concept presented in this report was identified through a feasibility study
led by the City of Monterey and prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff between 2011 and 2012. The study
was wholly funded by an AB 2766 grant awarded by the Monterey Unified Air Pollution Control District
(MBUAPCD). Roundabout operations, footprint, and pollutant emissions were determined and
compared to the existing conditions and the signal improvements described in the PR. The following
conclusions were made during the feasibility study:

          The roundabout is a feasible form of intersection control;
          Roundabout operations will reduce delay and queues;
          The roundabout alternative will have a smaller footprint and fewer impacts to the surrounding
          environment; and
          The roundabout alternative will result in fewer pollutant emissions.
The roundabout concept was identified in the Pebble Beach Company Project Final Environmental
Impact Report dated April 2012 as a traffic mitigation project.

The roundabout concepts presented in this report are refinements to the roundabout concept
developed in the feasibility study. The refinements were generated by Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI)
in January through March 2013 based on operational analysis and feedback from the City of Monterey
and Caltrans.

Project Description



COMMUNITY INTERACTION
City of Monterey, Transportation Agency for Monterey County (TAMC), Caltrans, CHOMP and PBC have
conducted coordination on improvements to SR 68 in the project area, resulting in significant
community approval on moving forward intersection and corridor improvements. In particular,
coordination has taken place in January through March of 2013 to move potential roundabout concepts
forward for consideration at the CHOMP and SR 1 Ramp intersections with SR 68.

Specific public outreach items that have taken place with regard to this project are as follows:

          Presentation to the TAMC Technical Advisory Committee (TAC);
          Stakeholder meeting at TAMC including; Presidio of Monterey, Monterey County, City of Pacific
          Grove, City of Monterey, Pebble Beach Company, Caltrans, TAMC, and Monterey Bay Unified Air
          Pollution Control District (MBUAPCD);
          Two presentations to CHOMP staff;
          Presentation to City of Pacific Grove staff;
          Presentation to professional organizations including the planning association, APWA, and CSPE
          (civil engineering group);
          Presentation on the local Monterey channel on the "Your Town" show
          Two presentations to the MBUAPCD board;
          Local television reports (twice);
          Presentation to a subcommittee of the County Board of Supervisors; and
          The project has received Monterey City Council approvals for contract approval, grant
          applications, and intent to annex.
All of the public outreach and community involvement activities listed above had outcomes that can be
characterized as favorable to the project.

In addition to community interaction, three ICE workshops were held with Caltrans through the
alternatives evaluation and documentation process. The first workshop was held on January 31, 2013
and presented the project approach and outline, and solicited feedback from Caltrans to refine the
scope of the evaluation. The second ICE workshop was held on February 19, 2013 and presented the
preliminary findings of the evaluation and solicited feedback from Caltrans. The third ICE workshop was
held in March 26, 2013 and presented the final findings and recommendations of the ICE.

EXISTING CONDITIONS

EXISTING GEOMETRIC FEATURES
SR 68 (Holman Highway) is a two-lane undivided conventional highway constructed in the early 1940s.
It serves as the primary transportation facility between SR 1 and the City of Pacific Grove, Pebble Beach,
and CHOMP.

The portion of SR 68 between CHOMP and SR 1 was upgraded with improved radii and superelevation
in the mid-1950s when this portion of the highway was designated as part of SR 68 with the posted
speed limit of 35 mph. The cross-section for SR 68 consists of two 12-foot lanes with shoulder widths
ranging from 2 feet to 4 feet. The design speed within the project limit is 35 mph. SR 68 is part of the
California Legal Truck Route and SR 1 is a Terminal Access (STAA) facility.

The SR 68/SR 1 southbound ramp configuration is a diamond off-ramp and on-ramp. The southbound
on-ramp begins approximately 250 feet south of the SR 68/SR 1 off-ramp intersection. Between SR 68
and the beginning of the southbound on-ramp is a two-way roadway providing access to Pebble Beach.
The Pebble Beach entrance forms a T-intersection with this two-way roadway, allowing the eastbound
approach to make both left- and right-turn movements.

Improvements to this portion of SR 68 are constrained by the existing facilities adjacent to the highway.
These facilities include the entrance to Pebble Beach 17 Mile Drive toll gate, Beverley Manor
Development, CHOMP entrance, Sunridge Road, Scenic Drive overcrossing of SR 68, and the existing SR
68 overcrossing of SR 1. The topography within the study area was also identified as a constraint, since
the land on the south side of SR 68 falls away steeply toward the Pebble Beach area.


TRAFFIC DATA
Existing and future traffic volumes were provided by the City of Monterey and are based on the
volumes used in the Del Monte Forest Plan (DMFP), prepared by Fehr & Peers in August 2011. The
existing year traffic counts were collected in April 2011.

The 2011 traffic counts were compared to the 2003 traffic counts used in the approved PR for the
Holman Highway Widening Project. The total entering 2011 volumes at the SR 68/SR 1 Ramp
intersection were found to be approximately 5.5% less in the AM peak hour and 10% less in the PM
peak hour than were counted in 2003. In general, the primary reduction in traffic between 2003 and
2011 was found to be on the northbound and southbound legs of the intersection. Additionally, the
2011 traffic counts were also found to be slightly lower than the forecasted 2010 traffic volumes
presented in the PR for the Holman Highway Widening Project.

The traffic volume scenarios analyzed for 2015 and 2030 include future growth based on changes of
land use, planned development, and anticipated growth within the region. The DMFP Alternative 1

Existing Conditions


traffic generation volumes were incorporated into the traffic volumes for all scenarios, as directed by
the City of Monterey. Alternative 1 of the DMPF assumed the inclusion of traffic associated with the
Spyglass Hotel in addition to the other land uses included in the trip generation estimates. The traffic
scenarios analyzed for this ICE are as follows:

          2011 with DMFP Alternative 1 traffic;
          2015 with DMFP Alternative 1 traffic; and
          2030 with DMFP Alternative 1 traffic (without POM traffic)
The above scenarios are the same that were analyzed in the DMFP, with the exception of the 2030
volumes which were modified to eliminate the traffic volumes associated with Presidio of Monterey.

Table 1 presents the traffic volumes used in each scenario for the analysis of the SR 68/SR 1 Ramp
Termini intersection. The volumes for the individual traffic movements have been isolated based on the
approved five-legged traffic signal configuration to show the volumes destined to the SR 1 southbound
on-ramp and those destined for Pebble Beach/17 Mile Drive. Table 2 presents the traffic volumes used
in each scenario for analyzing the Pebble Beach Gate/SR 1 SB On-Ramp intersection.

Traffic volume worksheets with the traffic scenarios presented above are provided in Attachment A.

COLLISION DATA
No new historical collision data was collected for this ICE. The approved PR for the Holman Highway
Widening Project presented collision rates on SR 68 and SR 1 for the three-year period from October 1,
2001 through September 30, 2004, and are provided in Table 3 below. The collision data is based on
Caltrans Traffic Accident Surveillance and Analysis System (TASAS) ­ Transportation Systems Network
(TSN).

The crash data from 2001-2004 indicates that crash rates were higher than the statewide averages at
the time, including for fatal crashes on SR 68. Two fatalities were recorded on SR 68 in the study area in
the three years of data; however, the specific locations of the fatalities are not known.


LAND USE
The existing land uses along SR 68 within the project limits consist of single-family residential abutting
the south side of SR 68 and primarily commercial and institutional land uses on the north side of SR 68.
CHOMP, Carmel Hills Care Center and Carmel Hills Professional Center are the primary developments
that make up the land uses on the north side of SR 68. There are two driveway entrances (CHOMP
entrance and the combined Carmel Hills Care Center and Carmel Hills Professional Center entrance)
with left-turn channelization. The CHOMP entrance to SR 68 is signalized.


ROUTE CONCEPT AND CORRIDOR VISION
SR 68 serves as the primary transportation facility between SR 1 and the City of Pacific Grove, Pebble
Beach, and CHOMP. Additionally, the intersection of SR 68 and SR 1 serves as a key access point to
these destinations. The Pebble Beach gate at the intersection of 17 Mile Drive and the SR 1 southbound
on-ramp is one of five gates accessing Pebble Beach and the Del Monte Forest.

The Holman Highway is an integral peninsula transportation link as one of two ways to access Pacific
Grove. The City of Monterey fundamentally wishes to preserve the integrity of this vital multimodal
transportation link. The City recognizes the land use and transportation context around the Holman
Highway has changed over the years, creating the need to re-define the character and use of the
roadway. For the segment between CHOMP and SR 1, this future context and character will evolve to a
more suburban form consistent with land uses and driver expectation.

Existing Conditions



BICYCLE ROUTE
SR 68 from SR 1 to Pacific Grove is classified as a Caltrans Bike Route in the TAMC Monterey County
2011 Bike Map. The segment of SR 68 in the study area currently has paved shoulders of varying widths
that accommodate bicycles. SR 68 is identified in the TAMC Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan
(December 2011) to be a Class II bike facility with bike lanes in the future.

A Class I multi-use path facility currently runs along the east side of SR 1 from SR 68 to Viejo Road. The
Class I multi-use path facility is identified in the TAMC Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan to extend
south of SR 68 along SR 1 in the future. The multi-use path system ties in with SR 68 on the east side of
the SR 68 overcrossing of SR 1.

Bicycle Network Maps from the TAMC Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan are included in Attachment
B.


PEDESTRIAN CONSIDERATIONS
No continuous pedestrian facilities currently exist along SR 68 through the study area. No signalized
pedestrian crossings are currently provided at the signalized intersection of SR 68 and SR 1 Ramp
Termini. An existing sidewalk connection is provided along the west side of Beverley Manor to a bus
stop located at the northwest corner of the intersection of Beverley Manor and SR 68.


DESIGN VEHICLE
SR 68 is part of the California Legal Truck Network and SR 1 is a Terminal Access (STAA) facility. Thus,
the ramp terminal intersection of SR 68 with SR 1 must accommodate the STAA-Standard truck as the
design vehicle. The design vehicle on SR 68 west of the SR 1 Ramp Termini intersection is a California
Truck.

The Pebble Beach gate entrance from the SR 1 southbound on-ramp south of SR 68 is the primary
entrance to Pebble Beach and 17 Mile Drive for STAA vehicles and other large delivery vehicles in
support of special events. Thus, the alternatives considered in this ICE were evaluated for their ability to
accommodate the design vehicles into the Pebble Beach gate.

ALTERNATIVES
Two alternatives were evaluated as part of this ICE. The alternatives focused on the intersection control
form for the SR 68 intersection with the SR 1 southbound ramps. Because of the close spacing between
SR 68 and the Pebble Beach gates, the alternatives encompassed the whole segment south of SR 68 to
the Pebble Beach gates. The two alternatives evaluated are a roundabout intersection and a five-legged
signalized intersection.

The primary distinctions between the two alternatives are:

     1. Intersection control form; and

     2. Location of the entrance to SR 1 southbound on-ramp.


ROUNDABOUT INTERSECTION ALTERNATIVE
The roundabout intersection alternative would replace the existing intersection control with a
roundabout at the SR 68/SR 1 Ramp Termini intersection, and a partial roundabout at the Pebble Beach
Gate/SR 1 Southbound Ramp intersection. The roundabout alternatives were developed for the 2015
and 2030 traffic scenarios and are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.

The roundabout concepts shown in Figures 3 and 4 are the same for the two scenarios, since the
configuration needed to accommodate traffic in 2015 accommodates traffic expected in 2030.


Roundabout Performance Checks
Performance checks were completed for the roundabout concept in addition to the design vehicle
checks described above. The performance checks document the safe and efficient operations of a
roundabout, and include checking fastest paths, vehicle speeds and speed consistency, vehicle path
alignment, and stopping and intersection sight distance.


Fastest Path and Vehicle Speed Checks
The fastest paths allowed by the geometry determines the negotiation speed for the particular
movement into, through, and exiting the roundabout. The paths represent the theoretical attainable
entry speeds for design purposes. The controlling radii of the paths through the roundabout are used to
determine the theoretical speeds for those radii. The fastest paths were drawn for each approach of
the 2015 Interim roundabout alternative and vehicle speeds estimated from those paths. The paths and
calculation worksheets are provided in Attachment C.

The proposed roundabout achieves the target safety performance as outlined in NCHRP Report 687
Roundabouts: An Informational Guide.

Alternatives


Vehicle Path Alignment
The natural vehicle paths through a roundabout are the paths approaching vehicles will naturally take
through the roundabout geometry, assuming there is traffic in all approach lanes. For a roundabout
with multiple entry lanes, the alignment of the natural vehicle paths should minimize conflicts or the
overlap of these paths entering or exiting the roundabout. The desired result of the entry design is for
vehicles to naturally be aligned into their correct lane within the circulatory roadway. This concept was
applied to the 2015 Interim roundabout concept to ensure desirable entry geometry. A sketch showing
the alignment of the natural entry paths is provided in Attachment C.

The proposed roundabout achieves the desired vehicle path alignment performance as outlined in
NCHRP Report 687 Roundabouts: An Informational Guide.


Sight Distance
The approach speeds determined through the fastest path checks were used to determine the required
stopping and intersection sight distance at the roundabout approaches and within the roundabout.
Stopping sight distance should be provided at every point within a roundabout and on each entering
and exiting approach. The intersection sight distance is the distance required for a driver without the
right-of-way to perceive and react to the presence of conflicting vehicles, and is achieved through the
establishment of sight triangles at the roundabout entries. The stopping and intersection sight distance
triangles were overlaid onto the 2015 Interim roundabout concept to illustrate the clear vision areas for
the intersection. These clear vision areas help establish the appropriate locations for various types of
landscaping or other treatments. The sight distance diagram is provided in Attachment C.

The proposed roundabout provides adequate stopping and intersection sight distance for the forecast
operating speeds.


TRAFFIC SIGNAL INTERSECTION ALTERNATIVE
The traffic signal intersection alternative would modify the existing traffic signal and intersection
configuration at the SR 68/southbound SR 1 Ramp Termini. The alternative would create a five-legged
intersection by separating the entrance to the SR 1 southbound on-ramp from the entrance to Pebble
Beach, creating two legs on the south side of the intersection The signal concept was included as the
preferred alternative in the approved PR for the Holman Highway Widening Project, and was outlined
as a Phase 2 improvement as a mitigation for the Pebble Beach Development Project. The proposed
intersection configurations are shown in Figure 5 and 6 below for the 2015 and 2030 traffic conditions,
respectively.

The primary difference between the 2015 and 2030 signal configurations is the addition of a second
eastbound lane on SR 68, and the addition of channelization on the southbound right-turn lane from
the SR 1 southbound off-ramp to SR 68 westbound. In the 2015 configuration, the eastbound right-turn
lane would serve traffic bound to both Pebble Beach/17 Mile Drive and the SR 1 southbound on-ramp.

Alternatives


In the 2030 signal configuration, the outside eastbound through lane terminates at the entrance to the
SR 1 southbound on-ramp. The signal alternative assumes that the two-lane overcrossing of SR 68 over
SR 1 will remain in place.

The signal alternative requires a portion of a two lane entrance ramp to southbound SR 1 made
possible by constructing a retaining wall along west edge of the ramp. The two lanes would merge to a
single lane entrance ramp near the point of entering SR 1 southbound, as shown in Figure 2. The
configuration of the two-lane ramp merging to one at the same point as it merges into the SR 1
southbound mainline is unconventional for two lane entrance ramp configurations and not consistent
with Caltrans single or two lane standard details.

OPERATIONS
The traffic operations of the traffic signal and roundabout alternatives were analyzed for AM and PM
peak hours in the 2015 and 2030 traffic scenarios using the traffic volumes presented in Table 1 above.
The traffic signal was analyzed using Synchro traffic analysis software, and the roundabout was
analyzed using SIDRA analysis software. Analysis procedures from the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM) were used within each software program to determine the level-of-service (LOS), critical volume-
to-capacity ratios (V/C), and queuing characteristics of the two alternatives. Caltrans-specific
roundabout capacity parameters were used in the analysis of the roundabout alternative. The results of
the 2015 analysis are presented in Table 4 and the results of the 2030 analysis are presented in Table 6.

The Synchro analysis outputs for the traffic signal alternative are provided in Attachment D. The SIDRA
analysis outputs for the roundabout alternative are provided in Attachment E.

westbound, and southbound approaches of the intersection will operate with a V/C ratio greater than
1.0 in the 2015 AM peak hour, with the eastbound and southbound approaches operating with a V/C
ratio greater than 1.0 in the PM peak hour. Significant queuing is also expected with the traffic signal on
the eastbound and southbound approaches, and the westbound left-turn queue is expected to exceed
the storage length in both peak periods. The westbound left-turn storage is constrained by the existing
width of the two-lane bridge over SR 1.
The southbound queue from the SR 1 off-ramp for the signal alternative in 2015 is expected to extend
approximately 1,150 feet; nearly to the painted gore where the off-ramp meets the SR 1 southbound

The expected length of the southbound queue in 2015 is shown in Figure 7.

The operation of the traffic signal assumes all vehicles destined to SR 1 southbound will be correctly
positioned in the right-turn lane approaching the intersection eastbound. This will require adequate
signing to inform drivers that they need to be in that lane, as well as provide guidance to the two
destinations (SR 1 southbound and Pebble Beach) reached from that lane. If pre-segregation is not
achieved, drivers will need to change lanes in the intersection.

The roundabout alternative is expected to operate at LOS C in the 2015 AM peak hour and LOS B in the
2015 PM peak hour. The roundabout is expected to have adequate capacity with a V/C ratio of 0.80 on
the eastbound approach in the AM peak hour and 0.63 in the PM peak hour. Additionally, queuing is
anticipated to be shorter with the roundabout alternative than with the signal alternative. Because of
the existing two-lane bridge over SR 1, the roundabout alternative assumes that the outside eastbound
lane merges just downstream of the roundabout, as shown in Figure 3. This is expected to cause an
under-utilization of the outside eastbound through lane, which was accounted for in the roundabout
analysis.

The signal and roundabout alternatives were compared based on the performance criteria of 2015
traffic operations. The alternatives were found to meet the performance criteria if they operate at LOS
D or better and are not expected to experience significant queue spillback on SR 68 or the SR 1 SB Off-
Ramp. Additionally, a V/C threshold of 1.0 was used for the signal alternative and a V/C threshold of
0.85 was used for the roundabout alternative. Table 5 summarizes the performance comparison for
2015 operations. The roundabout was found to better meet the performance criteria for 2015 traffic
operations.

2030 OPERATIONS
Table 6 shows the traffic signal alternative is expected to operate at LOS D during the AM and PM peak
hours in the 2030 traffic scenario. The eastbound, westbound, and southbound approaches of the
intersection will operate at or near a V/C ratio of 1.0 in the AM peak hour, and the eastbound and
westbound approaches will operate near capacity during the PM peak hour. Queuing on the eastbound
and southbound approaches is expected to be reduced from the 2015 signal operations, though queues
are forecast to be longer than the roundabout alternative. The westbound left-turn queue is expected
to exceed the storage length in both peak periods. The westbound left-turn storage is constrained by
the existing width of the two-lane bridge over SR 1.

The improvement to the operations of the traffic signal alternative can be attributed to an additional
lane eastbound on SR 68, as well as the channelization of the southbound right-turn lane to allow for
free-flow right-turn movements from the SR 1 off-ramp. However, the operations assume all eastbound
vehicles destined to the SR 1 southbound on-ramp will be correctly positioned in the outside through
lane which drops in the intersection, and all eastbound through vehicles positioned in the inside
through lane. This will require adequate advance signing eastbound to inform drivers traveling through

                                                                        24                                   Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

the intersection that they need to be in the inside through lane to avoid merging left within the
intersection.

The roundabout concept analyzed for 2030 is identical to that analyzed for 2015. The roundabout
alternative is expected to operate at LOS D in the 2030 AM peak hour and LOS B in the 2030 PM peak
hour. The roundabout is expected to operate with a V/C ratio of 0.90 on the eastbound approach in the
2030 PM peak hour. All other approaches are expected to operate with a V/C ratio of 0.78 or better.
Additionally, queuing is anticipated to be shorter with the roundabout alternative than with the signal
alternative. Similar to the 2015 analysis, the roundabout alternative assumes the outside eastbound
lane merges just downstream of the roundabout because of the existing two-lane bridge over SR 1. This
is expected to cause an under-utilization of the outside eastbound through lane, which was accounted
for in the roundabout analysis.

The signal and roundabout alternatives were compared based on the performance criteria of 2030
traffic operations. The alternatives were found to meet the performance criteria if they operate at LOS
D or better and are not expected to experience significant queue spillback on SR 68 or the SR 1
southbound off-ramp. Additionally, a V/C threshold of 1.0 was used for the signal alternative and a V/C
threshold of 0.85 was used for the roundabout alternative. Table 7 summarizes the performance
comparison for 2030 operations. Neither alternative meets the capacity threshold criteria for 2030
operations; however the roundabout was found to better meet the performance criteria overall.

FUTURE INVESTMENT NEEDED TO EXTEND SERVICE LIFE

Traffic Signal Alternative
The traffic signal alternative as shown in Figure 5 can be built in the interim (2015) by reconfiguring the
SR 1 southbound on-ramp and Pebble Beach gate access, adding turn lanes on the SR 1 southbound off-
ramp, and adding the second eastbound approach lane. The improvements to the west leg of the
intersection would be built at the ultimate footprint required for the 2030 configuration, which includes
retaining walls and the possible realignment of Sunridge Road along the south side of SR 68. This
configuration is expected to operate over capacity and with high delay and queues from the beginning,
so effective operations service life does not apply.


                                                                 25                           Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

Operations


To provide additional operating capacity to accommodate 2030 traffic conditions, the signal alternative
requires widening SR 68 to four lanes to the west and the channelization of the southbound right-turn
lane from the SR 1 southbound off-ramp to operate as a free-flow lane. This configuration would
improve traffic operations to LOS D and reduce the V/C ratios on most approaches to less than 1.0.


Roundabout Alternative
The traffic operations analysis presented above indicates the roundabout intersection alternative
requires no additional improvements from those proposed for the 2015 Interim design year to extend
the design life to 2030. The eastbound approach leg of the roundabout would operate with a V/C of
0.90 in 2030, which is higher than the practical V/C limit of 0.85. Improvements that would further
extend the operating design life of the roundabout alternative are adding a second southbound through
lane from the SR 1 southbound off-ramp, or widening the SR 68 overcrossing of SR 1 to three lanes (one
additional eastbound lane). Either of the improvements would distribute traffic more evenly through
the roundabout and allow for improved operations on the eastbound intersection approach.

The 2015 interim roundabout configuration can be constructed as to not preclude the future widening
of SR 68 to three lanes. The west leg of the intersection on SR 68 would be built at the proposed
alignment and footprint of the future 3-lane widening. The roundabout configuration would also
accommodate future widening of the SR 68 bridge over SR 1 if carried forward with the Holman
Highway Widening Project. Widening the bridge would improve the operations of the eastbound
roundabout approach by extending the downstream merge and evenly distributing traffic between the
two through lanes.

The signal and roundabout alternatives were compared based on the performance criteria of the future
investment needed to extend the service life of the intersection. The basis for the performance of the
alternatives was a comparison of which alternative requires the least investment to extend the service
life. The roundabout alternative was found to best meet the performance criteria, as shown in Table 8.

LIFE-CYCLE COST
A concept-level comparison of life-cycle cost components was performed for the traffic signal and
roundabout alternatives. More detailed construction cost estimates for the alternatives were not
performed as part of the ICE in order to compare the initial capital costs. A 20-year life-cycle was
assumed for the evaluation. The 2015 interim and 2030 ultimate configurations for each of the
alternatives are not expected to differ significantly, so the comparison below is based on the 2015
interim configuration. The following life-cycle cost components are discussed below for comparison
purposes:

Operations & Maintenance
The traffic signal alternative is expected to require an annual operations and maintenance budget over
the 20-year life cycle. The operations and maintenance is expected to cost approximately $6,000 per
year, totaling $120,000 over the 20-year life cycle.

The roundabout alternative is not expected to require similar operations and maintenance costs over
the design life.


Landscaping Maintenance
Both alternatives require the establishment of landscaping in areas affected by the construction of the
alternative, as well as median and island areas integral to the alternatives. These areas will also require
maintenance of the landscaped areas over the life cycle. The estimated landscaped areas are shown in
green in the alternative concepts in Figure 3 through Figure 6. The 2015 interim traffic signal alternative
has approximately 3,900 square yards (0.8 acres) of landscaped area, while the roundabout alternative
has approximately 6,200 square yards (1.27 acres) of landscaped area. Based on the concept-level
estimates, the roundabout alternative will have approximately 60% higher landscape maintenance
costs than the traffic signal alternative.


Pavement Rehabilitation
Both alternatives are expected to require an asphalt pavement overlay within the 20-year life cycle to
maintain the pavement condition. The total pavement areas of the 2015 interim alternative concepts
were compared to determine the relative life cycle costs associated with pavement rehabilitation. The
area considered included the total area impacted by the proposed concepts, and extends to where the
alternative concept transitions back to the existing cross-section. In general, these impacts consist of
widening on the SR 1 ramps and widening to the west on SR 68. The 2015 interim traffic signal
alternative has approximately 17,950 square yards (3.7 acres) of pavement area, while the roundabout
has approximately 13,350 square yards (2.75 acres) of pavement area. Based on the concept-level
estimates, the traffic signal alternative will have approximately 35% higher pavement rehabilitation
costs than the roundabout alternative.

Crash Costs
Costs associated with vehicle collisions have not been quantified, but a comparison based on expected
crash reductions for the intersection type is provided. The "Safety Characteristics" section below
provides more detail on the expected safety performance of the alternatives. The Highway Safety
Manual (HSM) contains a Crash Modification Factor (CMF) for converting a traffic signal to a
roundabout. The CMF predicts a 24% reduction in total crashes and a 66% reduction in fatal/severe
injury crashes with the conversion of a traffic signal to a roundabout. A summary of 2010 average
comprehensive costs for various crash severities from the National Safety Council are provided below
for reference.

          Fatality                                  $4,360,000
          Class A incapacitating injury             $ 220,300
          Class B evident injury                    $   56,200
          Class C possible injury                   $   26,700
          Property damage only                      $   2,400
The roundabout alternative is expected to have lower life cycle costs associated with motor vehicle
crashes based on the expected crash performance compared to the traffic signal alternative.


Life Cycle Cost Summary
The signal and roundabout alternatives were compared based on the life cycle costs expected for each
alternative. The alternative with the lower expected costs over the 20-year life cycle was considered to
best meet the performance criteria. Table 9 summarizes the comparison for the life cycle cost
components.

GEOMETRICS AND OTHER DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

GUIDE SIGNING
Due to the unconventional forms of the signal and roundabout alternatives being evaluated, guide
signing could have an impact on traffic operations. The key aspects of guide signing for the signal
alternative are as follows:

          Eastbound direction:
               o Guidance to the multiple destinations and multiple decision points (Pebble Beach, SR 1
                 NB, SR 1 SB)
               o Segregating through traffic to the inside lane only
               o Delineating the two destinations (SR 1 southbound and Pebble Beach) that are
                 physically separated but both accessed from the outside lane.
          Southbound direction:
               o Guidance to SR 1 southbound and Pebble Beach
          Westbound direction:
               o Delineating the two destinations (Pebble Beach and SR 1 southbound) that are
                 physically separated by both accessed from the left-turn lane.
The key aspects of the guide signing for the roundabout alternative are as follows:

          Eastbound direction:
               o Provide adequate advance guidance on the multiple destinations (Pebble Beach, SR 1
                 northbound, SR 1 southbound)
               o Provide guidance at the entry point of the right turn lane. Decision point to either
                 Pebble Beach or SR 1 southbound.
Other key aspects of the roundabout guide signing would be to convert the existing guide signing
messages to be specific to the change in movements typical with a roundabout (i.e. circulating to make
a left-turn). Both the roundabout and traffic signal require clear messaging to direct traffic to the
destinations, but the signal requires additional messaging related to the added decision points and
specific lane designation for traffic in the eastbound direction. For the 2030 ultimate configuration, the
signal may require overhead lane-use signing in the eastbound direction to direct through traffic into
the inside lane, and traffic destined to SR 1 southbound is in the outside lane.

Guide signing concepts for the 2015 interim configurations of both alternatives were prepared and
included in Attachment F.

Geometrics and Other Design Considerations


The signal and roundabout alternatives were compared based on the complexity of the guide signing
needed to support the geometric configuration proposed. The signal alternative requires more
guidance to direct drivers to the correct destinations, as well as to designate traffic into specific lanes
compared to the roundabout. The roundabout alternative was found to best meet the performance
criteria for complexity of signing, as shown in Table 10.

TRUCK ACCOMMODATION
The design vehicle for the intersection of SR 68 with the SR 1 Ramp Termini is the STAA-Standard truck.
Vehicle turning templates using the STAA-Standard truck were run for key movements of the 2015
interim alternative concepts to test if they accommodate the required vehicles. The key vehicle
movements evaluated are described below. Exhibits showing each of the design vehicle checks are
provided in Attachment G.


Northbound Right-Turn from Pebble Beach
          Roundabout alternative: The design vehicle uses both lanes exiting Pebble Beach.
          Signal alternative: The design vehicle uses both lanes exiting Pebble Beach. The design vehicle
          also encroaches on the northbound left-turn lane at the SR 68 intersection.


Hwy 1 Southbound Off-Ramp to Southbound On-Ramp
          Signal alternative: Unconventional movement for oversize loads.
          Roundabout alternative: Conventional movement. Decision point exiting roundabout to Pebble
          Beach or SR 1 southbound.


WB Left-Turn to Pebble Beach
          Signal alternative: Requires the full pavement width entering Pebble Beach. Slight
          encroachment into oncoming lanes entering Pebble Beach.
          Roundabout alternative: Requires the full pavement width entering Pebble Beach.


WB Left-Turn to Hwy 1 SB Ramp
          Signal alternative: STAA-Standard design vehicle not accommodated. The largest vehicle
          accommodated is a "Motorhome" design vehicle that must start the left-turn movement from
          the westbound through lane.

Geometrics and Other Design Considerations


          Roundabout alternative: Conventional movement. Decision point exiting roundabout to Pebble
          Beach or SR 1 southbound.
The signal and roundabout alternatives were compared based on the ability to adequately serve the
required design vehicle for all movements. As outlined above, the traffic signal alternative does not
adequately serve the design truck for the westbound left-turn to the SR 1 southbound on-ramp. The
roundabout alternative serves the design truck for all movements. Table 11 summarizes the finding the
roundabout alternative best fits the performance criteria for accommodating trucks.

SAFETY CHARACTERISTICS
The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) provides a relative comparison of the safety characteristics of the
two alternatives. The HSM provides Crash Modification Factors (CMFs) for various conditions that help
to quantify the relative change in predicted crashes due to the change in condition.


Predictive Measures
The HSM contains a CMF for converting a traffic signal to a roundabout. The base condition is the
presence of a traffic signal, and the CMF predicts a 24% reduction in total crashes (standard error +/-
10%) and a 66% reduction in fatal/severe injury crashes (standard error +/- 12%) with the conversion of
the base condition to a roundabout. The CMF does not account for the closely spaced downstream
intersection which introduces additional decision points and conflicts. However, the safety performance
trends for the roundabout appear to generally be preserved with the proposed concept. The traffic
signal concept includes qualities and features that deviate from contemporary design principles, which
may skew the amount of relative change in predicted crashes with the signal versus the roundabout.


Surrogate Safety Measures
Since a detailed safety study was not conducted for this ICE, several measures that are commonly
looked at as surrogates for anticipating the likelihood or severity of a crash on a given facility were used
to evaluate the two alternatives. These surrogates are summarized as follows:

          Number of Conflict Points
               o 23 for 2015 Interim signal concept
               o 20 for 2015 Interim roundabout concept
               o Signal - Queue spillback from signal westbound to southbound
          Reduced Speed Potential

               o Roundabout reduces speeds in the intersection
               o Roundabout reduces speed differential on southbound entrance ramp
          Crash Severity Potential
               o Roundabout eliminates most severe crash types
The signal and roundabout alternatives were compared based on the anticipated safety performance.
The two performance measures used were the predictive measures and the surrogate safety measures.
The roundabout was found to have a predicted reduction in total and fatal/injury crashes compared to
the signal alternative, as documented in the HSM CMFs. The roundabout alternative was also found to
have characteristics that are commonly used as surrogates for having a reduced likelihood for the
number and severity of crashes. Table 12 summarizes the safety performance comparison between the
traffic signal and roundabout alternatives.

BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN ACCOMMODATION
The accommodation of bicycles and pedestrians through the study intersection was compared for the
two alternatives.


Traffic Signal Alternative
The traffic signal alternative accommodates bicycles much in the same way as they are accommodated
in the existing condition. In the interim concept, bicycles are provided a marked lane in the eastbound
direction between the through lane and the right-turn lane. In the ultimate configuration, bicycles are
provided a marked lane westbound through the intersection, which transitions to a paved shoulder to
the west. The channelized southbound right-turn lane in the ultimate signal configuration creates a
weaving maneuver with bicycles traveling through the intersection, as well as with vehicles turning
right into Beverley Manor.

No improvements to pedestrian facilities are proposed with the approved traffic signal concept.
Signalized pedestrian crossings could be added to the west and north legs of the intersection to provide
connections across and along SR 68 and to Pebble Beach.


Roundabout Alternative
Bicycles can be accommodated through the SR 68/SR 1 Ramp Termini intersection in two ways with the
proposed roundabout alternative. More experienced bicyclists may choose to take the lane and travel
through the roundabout as a vehicle. For those not wishing to do so, separated bike and pedestrian

                                                            33                       Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

Geometrics and Other Design Considerations


facilities can be added adjacent to the intersection to allow bicyclists to leave the roadway and navigate
around the roundabout as a pedestrian. No additional bike facilities are proposed on the approach legs
to the roundabout alternative. The concepts in Figures 3 and 4 show potential accommodations for
bicycles.

The roundabout alternative also shows potential pedestrian improvements that can be added with the
project to improve pedestrian access across and along SR 68. At-grade and grade-separated pedestrian
and bike crossings are shown in the concept plans for providing access between the north and south
sides of SR 68, as well as additional sidewalk along the north side of SR 68 that extends west to Beverley
Manor.

The performance of the signal and roundabout alternatives were compared based on the ability to
accommodate pedestrians and bicycles through the intersection and study area. In general, both
alternatives have the ability to accommodate pedestrians and bicycles; however, the signal alternative
concept as approved does not provide the same level of pedestrian access through the study area
compared to the roundabout concept. Table 13 summarizes the performance comparison of the traffic
signal and roundabout alternatives with regard to accommodating pedestrians and bicycles.

Non-Conforming Features




NON-CONFORMING FEATURES

APPROVED DESIGN EXCEPTIONS
Four non-standard mandatory design features and one advisory design feature were approved in
December 2000 as part of the PSR Process for the Holman Highway Widening Project. Mike Janzen, HQ
Design Reviewer, on January 12, 2006 reviewed two design exception fact sheets approved November
8, 2000 and November 22, 2000 and concurred that they continue to be appropriate for current use.

The mandatory design exceptions associated with the proposed four-lane widening and signalized
intersection alternative include:

     1. Horizontal Curve Radii: Curve 2 is an existing curve with a radius of 167.64 meters (550 feet).
        This radius will be maintained. Curve 3 is a new curve with radius of 167.64 meters (550 feet),
        which replaces an existing curve with radius 144 meters (472 feet).

     2. Superelevation: Curve 1 will maintain the existing superelevation rate of 0.04 and 496 meter
        (1627 feet) radius curvature to conform to the existing roadway at the westerly project limits.
        Curve 2 will maintain existing curvature with a radius of 168 meters (550 feet) and will have a
        superelevation of 0.09.

     3. Ramp/Local Road Intersection Spacing: The intersection of SR 68, the southbound ramps and
        the Pebble Beach Entrance will become a five-leg intersection with non-standard distance
        between the southbound on-ramp and Pebble Beach Entrance. Additionally, Pebble Beach
        Entrance intersects the southbound on-ramp with a right-turn only lane. The new configuration
        improves the two-way traffic condition that exists between SR 68 and the southbound on-ramp.

     4. Access Control: Existing access control line will be changed. The new configuration of the
        intersection provides for access control between Pebble Beach Entrance and the southbound
        on-ramp as shown.

One non-standard advisory design feature was approved November 2000 which was the inability for
California trucks to make the left-turn movement from westbound SR 68 to the southbound SR 1 on-
ramp. California trucks and buses will have to continue toward Pacific Grove to seek a return route to
SR 1. Appropriate mitigation and signing will be included.


DEVIATIONS FROM HDM DESIGN STANDARDS
The following deviations from the California Highway Design Manual (HDM) have been identified and
may require design exception fact sheet approval.

Non-Conforming Features


Traffic Signal Alternative
Using Chapter 400 (Intersections At Grade) of the Caltrans Highway Design Manual (HDM) the following
potential deviations of the alternative concepts from the design standards were identified:

          Items number 3 and 4 of the "Approved Design Exceptions" section above apply to the
          signalized intersection alternative.
          The proposed signal concept maintains the westbound left-turn restriction to California trucks
          and buses.
          The signalized intersection alternative deviates from design standards with inadequate
          proposed westbound left-turn storage because of the constraint of the existing bridge.


Roundabout Alternative
The roundabout alternative is expected to deviate from HDM design standards similar to the traffic
signal alternative only for Item 3 and 4 of the "Approved Design Exceptions" section above. The
roundabout configuration may require the same intersection spacing and access control design
exceptions that have been approved for the signal concept. No other deviations from HDM design
standards are expected for the roundabout alternative.


NONCONFORMING ROUNDABOUT FEATURES
The roundabout alternative concept was compared to the National Cooperative Highway Research
Program (NCHRP) Report 672 Roundabouts: An Informational Guide to determine any non-conforming
features. The preliminary roundabout concept presented in this ICE was found to conform to the
guidance contained in Roundabouts: An Informational Guide.

The roundabout intersection alternative was found to perform better than the traffic signal alternative
in almost all criteria. The operations of the traffic signal were found to not be acceptable in the 2015 or
2030 design years, and the 4-lane widening of SR 68 is required to accommodate the proposed ultimate
2030 traffic signal configuration. The roundabout alternative can be constructed independently of the
future 4-lane widening of SR 68.

Recommendations


The geometric and design considerations considered in this study favored the roundabout alternative.
The roundabout was found to accommodate all traffic movements for the design vehicle, where the
traffic signal limits some movements for trucks. The roundabout alternative allows for less complex
guide signing through the intersection, where the traffic signal requires specific lane designations to
reach destinations in the eastbound and southbound directions. Additionally, the roundabout
alternative has better expected safety performance than the traffic signal alternative.

Based on the results, the City of Monterey recommends the roundabout alternative be moved forward
as the preferred alternative for the SR 68/SR 1 Southbound Ramp Termini intersection.

As the roundabout alternative is moved forward into PS&E, the City of Monterey will look for
opportunities to coordinate with Caltrans and other agencies to refine the proposed concepts.

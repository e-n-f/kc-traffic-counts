Sky Ranch Lodge Traffic Impact Analysis (SWI #12100)                                  December 11, 2013


INTRODUCTION
Sky Ranch Lodge is an existing hotel in "West" Sedona located on the Airport Mesa west of the
Sedona Airport on Airport Road. The project location is shown on Figure 1 -- Vicinity Map. The
expansion will include 40 rooms and a meeting room capable of supporting 200 patrons. The meeting
room facility is approximately 7,500 square feet including associated support space. The site plan is
shown on Figure 2 ­ Site Plan. Per the City of Sedona, a Traffic Impact Analysis is warranted when a
development generates more than 100 vehicles during a peak hour. It should be noted that the
proposed additional 40 rooms are projected to generate 22 vehicles per hour during the AM peak
hour, 24 vehicles per hour during the PM peak hour. The 200 person meeting room, which is
anticipated to be attended mostly by patrons of the hotel, has been projected to conservatively
generate 50% of its trips off-site and therefore will add 25 trips in the AM peak and 25 trips during
the PM peak. The City of Sedona (COS) is requiring a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) be performed
for the proposed "Sky Ranch Lodge" to ensure efficiency and safety in traffic operations are
maintained within the surrounding transportation network.


Per ADOT's Traffic Impact Analysis for Proposed Development guideline, a Category I analysis is
characterized as a development that generates less than 500 peak hour trips during the morning or
afternoon peak hour and therefore will be used as the guide from which this TIA will be performed.


PURPOSE OF THE REPORT AND STUDY OBJECTIVE

The purpose of this document is to identify possible traffic impacts and to recommend any potential
improvements to maintain efficient and safe traffic operations. The objectives of this study are to:


    1. Determine the trip generation rates, directional distribution and travel patterns of site
         generated traffic at build out.
    2.    Determine the extent to which traffic generated by the proposed development will impact
         current traffic conditions in the surrounding area.
    3. Determine what traffic control and/or geometric improvements might be necessary to
         maintain acceptable levels of service upon build out of the proposed development.

This study will specifically look at the intersection of Highway 89A/Airport Drive, as well as the
overall operation of Airport Road. Although a queuing analysis is only required for Category II
analyses, a queuing analysis will be included in this study.


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Sky Ranch Lodge expansion is located on a 7.63 acre site on Airport Mesa in Sedona, AZ. The
Project will consist of an expansion to include 40 new rooms and a new 7,500 square foot / 200
person meeting room. The property is located on Airport mesa which is approximately 1 mile up
Airport Road. The site is surrounded by Airport facilities and Forest Service property. The hotel is
not located near any other commercial facilities and approximately 4,600 feet from the nearest
residential intersection therefore pedestrian and bicycle traffic is close to non-existent. Pedestrian
activity is active at two locations along Airport Road; the Vortex and at the "Sunset Vista" at the top
of the mesa. Both locations were observed at length on numerous days and both had all of the
pedestrians arrive via vehicle.


The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation land use code for hotels with
meeting room facilities predicts 327 daily trips. To address the City's concern that the ITE standards
might not adequately reflect Sedona conditions, 50 additional daily trips were added.


The intersection of Airport Road/Highway 89A and Airport Road will continue to operate at an
acceptable Level of Service (LOS) with the additional traffic generated by the expansion. The
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) rates intersections and road capacities using a Level of Service
scale of A through F, the intersection at Highway 89A and Airport Road currently operates at a Level
of Service (LOS) B for both morning and evening peak hours, and will continue to do so after the
Sky Ranch Lodge expansion is complete.


STUDY AREA CONDITIONS
Sky Ranch Lodge is accessible via Airport Road approximately 1 mile up on top of Airport mesa via
three existing driveways to the resort. Airport Road in the vicinity of the site is currently a two-lane,
two-way roadway with unpaved shoulders north of the Chimney Spire Road and minimal or no
shoulders south of the Chimney Spire Road. It consists of approximately 24 foot wide paved surface

                                                       2
Sky Ranch Lodge Traffic Impact Analysis (SWI #12100)                                     December 11, 2013


north of Chimney Spire Road and approximately 20 to 22 foot wide south of Chimney Spire Road
and includes one travel lane in each direction. South of Chimney Spire Road, Airport Road starts to
ascend on the side of the mesa creating a cut on one side of the road and a fill on the other. On the
cut side of the road, a concrete curb channel was installed for drainage purposes and on the fill side of
the road, a guardrail exist to protect vehicles from leaving the roadway. The posted speed limit on
Airport Road is 25 mph. Airport Road is currently striped to allow no passing in both directions.


There is an existing pedestrian crossing that accesses the parking lot across Airport Road from Sky
Ranch Lodge. There is no striped crosswalk, but there is a pedestrian sign warning vehicles travelling
on Airport Road. Internal circulation will be addressed as the site plan moves further along in its
planning process; the intent is to have a walkable site. Only minor outside pedestrian traffic is
anticipated to access the Vista or nearby trails for recreational hiking. Due to the remoteness of the
lodge, off-site tourist activities are expected to be done via vehicle.


As mentioned previously the site is currently developed with three existing driveways of off Airport
Road. Airport Road is a collector roadway with one lane in each direction that serves as the primary
access to Sedona Airport from Highway 89A. The roadway appears to be in need of some surface
maintenance. Striping throughout the roadway is faded and needs to be re-striped.


The intersection of Airport Road/Highway 89A is signalized. Both westbound and eastbound
legs of Highway 89A have a dedicated left turn lane, two through lanes, and a dedicated right turn
lane entering the intersection. Both northbound and southbound legs of Airport Road have a
dedicated left turn lane and one combination through/right turn lane entering the intersection. The
through movement is minimal due to the land use on the north side of the intersection including an
office complex, church and hotel. See Figure 3 for lane configuration details.


Airport Road from Highway 89A to the top of the Mesa is approximately 1 mile long. From Highway
89A intersection to approximately 1,100 feet south (Chimney Spire Road) land uses adjacent to
Airport Road include commercial property and access to the Saddlerock and Les Springs
subdivisions. Beyond the 1,100 feet south to the top of the mesa at approximately 5,700 feet, Airport
Road is rural in nature with no access points except to the small parking lot for the Vortex.

The Vortex parking area does seem to be too small for its popularity and therefore feels congested as
vehicles slow to look for parking. Both the Vortex and Overlook areas generate pedestrian traffic
after their vehicles are parked. The Vortex parking is on the same side as the Vortex landmark, where
the Overlook parking requires pedestrians to cross Airport Road. The crossing is not marked but road
signage and speed bumps exist to warn drivers. On occasion the when the Vortex parking area is full
a visitor may park at the Overlook and walk down Airport Road to the Vortex landmark. In order to
reduce the number of visitors walking on Airport Road a new hiking trail has been constructed from
the parking area at the Overlook to the parking area at the Vortex.
Signage is scheduled to be installed to direct pedestrians to use the trail.


Other than the occasional recreational bicyclist or pedestrian, bicycle and pedestrian activity is close
to non-existent mostly due to the fact that there is not real connectivity to draw this type of activity.

EXISTING TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS
INTERSECTION
Accident data from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2011 has been analyzed for Airport Road.
Airport Road has experienced a total of four accidents in the last three years, all without injury and
none of them involving pedestrian or bicycle traffic. They involved a rear end accident at the SR 89A
intersection, a vehicle backing, and two vehicles individually hitting the guardrail. This information
was obtained from the City of Sedona Police Department; the full accident list is included in the
Appendix for reference.


Results of the Final Soldiers Pass Road Area Traffic Study (SPRAT), dated April 2007, indicate that
there is no distinct morning or evening peak hour travel time periods. The data indicates a peak travel
period between 10AM and 5PM. Existing intersection turning movements at the intersection of
Airport Road/Highway 89A were collected by Shephard-Wesnitzer, Inc. from 11 AM to 1PM and
4PM to 6PM on November 7, 2013. There is a peak hour from 12PM to 1PM and another peak hour
from 5PM to 6PM. The existing traffic shows an approximate 50 percent split in eastbound traffic vs.
westbound traffic. See Figure 4 for existing traffic volumes. The complete intersection counts are
included in the Appendix.


It should be noted that October and early November typically have the highest counts of the year in
Sedona and that between the 5:00 and 6:00 PM hour a lot of the "sunset" traffic enters and exits the
intersection as tourist drive to the Vista area on the mesa.


Level of Service (LOS) results define traffic flow conditions. A scale of "A" to "F" is used to rate
congestion as determined by delay (seconds/vehicle). A LOS "A" represents optimum conditions and
LOS "F" defines undesirable congested conditions. Urban environments are considered effective
down to LOS "D". Capacity analyses were conducted using the methodologies defined in the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). HCS 2010 was used to analyze the intersection to determine
existing conditions LOS. Table 1 illustrates the existing LOS for the intersection study. The
completed LOS analysis worksheets are provided in the Appendix.

Queue lengths represent the number of vehicles stopped in any one lane at one time, either waiting for
a gap in traffic or waiting for the light to change. The area of this study requires specific attention be
paid to queue lengths and their possible conflicts, therefore each movement's queuing lengths will
also be presented in Table 1. The queuing length listed for the signalized intersection represents the
50th percentile length during each cycle.

ROADWAY
According to the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) and the variables present at Airport Road, it can
accommodate approximately 800 vehicles per hour (vph) for a LOS C. At a LOS D, which is
typically what roads are designed for, the capacity increases to 1,100 vph. ADT traffic counts for

two locations of Airport Road were collected; one just south of Highway 89A and another one uphill
from the vortex parking area. Two locations were chosen in order to determine how many vehicles
are using Airport Road near the Highway 89A intersection and how many are using Airport Road to
travel all the way to the top of the mesa. As shown in the table below, both the AM and PM peak
hour volumes are well below the actual capacity of Airport Road. The ADT traffic counts are
included in the appendix.

PROJECTED TRAFFIC
The Sky Ranch Lodge expansion is expected to be completed by the end of 2014. Therefore, one
year of background traffic has been applied to the "2013 Existing" traffic counts before "site
generated traffic" was added. Background traffic is the traffic existing around the site at a given year
that is not due to the development being added but instead due to general population growth in the
area. The ADOT Average Annual Growth Rate (AAGR) for the area is listed as 1.031; therefore a
growth rate of 3.1 percent has been applied to the existing counts. One year of growth to the 2013
existing traffic counts is illustrated in Figure 5 ­ 2014 Background Traffic.


The average daily traffic volumes, including AM and PM peak hour trips generated by the proposed
development have been estimated using trip rates provided by the Institution of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, Eighth Edition. ITE land use code 310: Hotel predicts 327 daily
trips including 22 AM and 24 PM peak hour trips for the proposed site. The number of proposed
rooms was used as the independent variable; for a "Hotel", meeting space is accounted for within the
expected "room" trip generation.


Although convention facilities are included in ITE land use code 310, the COS is concerned that this
method underestimates the trips generated by the meeting room. ITE was contacted to see if any
additional information on hotels with conference centers was available, but unfortunately that
information does not exist. Research on trips generated by convention facilities shows an average of
1.5 to 3 people per vehicle for events. SWI assumes there will be 2 people per vehicle, resulting in an
additional 100 daily trips generated by the conference center. SWI also assumes approximately 50%
of the people will also stay at the lodge, reducing the amount of trips generated to 50 daily trips.
Several municipalities throughout the southwest use methods similar to ITE land use code 310 to
estimate trips generated by hotels with conference centers. Additionally, the ADOT Traffic
Engineering Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures for traffic studies also recommends using ITE to
estimate the amount of trips generated by a proposed development. For the purposes of this study,
SWI will run an analysis with traffic volumes estimated by the ITE method as well as a worst case
scenario that includes an additional 50 vehicles per day. See Table 2 for a full list of generated traffic,
and Figure 6 for the site generated traffic distribution at the intersection of Airport Rd/Highway 89A.

TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
LEVEL OF SERVICE/QUEUING
The site generated traffic estimated using the ITE method was added to the 2014 background traffic
to determine the proposed total traffic volumes, see Figure 7. SWI also calculated a worst case
scenario by including an additional 50 trips to the PM peak hour rates, see Figure 8. The overall peak
hour volume was higher for the 5PM to 6PM peak hour than that of the 12PM to 1 PM peak hour.
The peak hour traffic volume on Airport Road was higher during the 5PM to 6PM peak hour, while
the traffic volume on Highway 89A was higher during the 12PM to 1PM peak hour. Both peak hours
were used for this analysis. Capacity analyses were conducted using the methodologies defined in the
HCM. HCS 2010 was used to analyze the intersections to determine proposed conditions. Table 3
illustrates the proposed conditions for the study area at the expected time of completion (2014) for
the intersection of Airport Road and Highway 89A. Since this is a Category I study, only the opening
year (2014) was studied. The completed HCS worksheets are provided in the Appendix.


AIRPORT ROAD ANALYSIS
As defined in the Existing Traffic Characteristics of the report, Airport Road in its existing
configuration can accommodate approximately up to 800 vehicles per hour (vph) for a LOS C and
1,100 vph at a LOS D. As shown in the table below, both the AM and PM peak hour volumes are
well below the actual capacity of Airport Road. The ADT traffic counts are included in the appendix.

After build out of the proposed Sky Ranch Lodge, Airport Road is expected to have 320 vph during
the PM peak hour, an overall increase of 49 vehicles. After the proposed expansion of the Sky Ranch
Lodge, Airport Road will be running at 29 percent of a LOS D the typical road design capacity just
south of the SR 89A signal. Since the proposed AM and PM peak volumes are both well below the
capacity of operating under a LOS C, the LOS capacity analysis was not performed.

Sky Ranch Lodge Traffic Impact Analysis (SWI #12100)                                    December 11, 2013


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Sky Ranch Lodge expansion proposal located at the top of Airport Mesa addition of 40 rooms
predicts 327 daily trips including 22 AM and 24 PM peak hour trips for the proposed site. The 200
person meeting room is assumed to generate 50 off-site trips per day including 25 Am and 25 PM
peak hour trips.


The intersection of Airport Road/Highway 89A currently operates at a LOS B for both morning and
evening peak hours, and will continue to do so after the Sky Ranch Lodge expansion is complete.
The additional traffic on Airport Road will not negatively impact the LOS of the roadway. The
current traffic volumes on Airport Road are below the actual capacity of the roadway. SWI does not
recommend any additional studies or modifications to Airport Road.


As mentioned previously, the Vortex parking area appears insufficient based on its popularity causing
it to feel congested as vehicles slow to look for parking. The construction of the new Forest Service
trail connecting the Vortex and Airport parking areas will reduce the probability of both bicyclists and
pedestrians from traveling along Airport Road from the Overlook to the Vortex. Trail signage will
help visitors to use the trail.

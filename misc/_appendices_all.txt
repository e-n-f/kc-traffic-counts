6. General Plan Designation:               Residential 15 and Mixed Use

7. Zoning:                                 Currently RS 10,000; following the General Plan
                                           conformity action the zoning will be RM 3,000.

8. Description of Project:

The applicant proposes to develop a 45-unit multi-family residential development for low and very low-
income residents on Base Line Road approximately 1000 feet east of Towne Avenue in the City of
Claremont (A vicinity map, aerial photo and preliminary site plan are provided as Figures 1, 2 and 3
respectively).

The site is currently vacant except for an abandoned, circular water reservoir that is 107 feet in
diameter. The I-210 Freeway abuts the site directly to the south and an Edison substation directly to
the east.




INITIAL STUDY                                                                           Page 1 of 38
The area in the vicinity of the site consists of commercial and residential uses. To the north of the
proposed development across Base Line Road are single-family homes, to the east is a Southern
California Edison substation, to the west is vacant land used as a strawberry field and to the south is
the I-210 Freeway.

The City of Claremont's General Plan was adopted on November 14, 2006. The new General Plan
designates the project site as Residential 15. The new land use designation allows for multi-family
housing. The City is in the process of completing Citywide zone changes to make all current zoning
designations consistent with the new General Plan. Once completed, the new zoning designation for
the project site will be RM 3,000. The zone change will be adopted prior to the action on this
proposed project.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS POTENTIALLY AFFECTED:

The environmental factors checked below would be potentially affected by this project, involving at
least one impact that is a "Potentially Significant Impact" as indicated by the checklist on the following
pages.

  X    Aesthetics                          Agriculture Resources        X    Air Quality

       Utilities/Service Systems       X   Mandatory Findings of Significance

DETERMINATION (To be completed by the Lead Agency):

On the basis of this initial evaluation:

       I find that the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on the environment, and
       a NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

       I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment,
       there will not be a significant effect in this case because revisions in the project have been
       made by or agreed to by the project proponent. A MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION
       will be prepared.

  X    I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment, and an
       ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required.

       I find that the proposed project MAY have a "potentially significant" or "potentially significant
       unless mitigated" impact on the environment, but at least one effect 1) has been adequately
       analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable legal standards, and 2) has been
       addressed by mitigation measures based on the earlier analysis as described on attached
       sheets. An ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required, but it must analyze only the
       effects that remain to be addressed.

       I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment,
       because all potentially significant effects (a) have been analyzed adequately in an earlier EIR
       or NEGATIVE DECLARATION pursuant to applicable standards, and (b) have been avoided
       or mitigated pursuant to that earlier EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION, including revisions or
       mitigation measures that are imposed upon the proposed project, nothing further is required.

EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS:

1) A brief explanation is required for all answers except "No Impact" answers that are adequately supported by
   the information sources a lead agency cites in the parentheses following each question. A "No Impact"
   answer is adequately supported if the referenced information sources show that the impact simply does not
   apply to projects like the one involved (e.g. the project falls outside a fault rupture zone). A "No Impact"
   answer should be explained where it is based on project-specific factors as well as general standards
   (e.g. the project will not expose sensitive receptors to pollutants, based on a project-specific screening
   analysis).

2) All answers must take account of the whole action involved, including off-site as well as on-site, cumulative
   as well as project-level, indirect as well as direct, and construction as well as operational impacts.

3) Once the lead agency has determined that a particular physical impact may occur, then the checklist
   answers must indicate whether the impact is potentially significant, less than significant with mitigation, or
   less than significant. "Potentially Significant Impact" is appropriate if there is substantial evidence that an
   effect is significant. If there are one or more "Potentially Significant Impact" entries when the determination
   is made, an EIR is required.

4) "Negative Declaration: Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated" applies where the incorporation
   of mitigation measures has reduced an effect from "Potentially Significant Impact" to a "Less than
   Significant Impact." The lead agency must describe the mitigation measures, and briefly explain how they
   reduce the effect to a less than significant level (mitigation measures from Section XVII, "Earlier Analyses,"
   may be cross-referenced).

5) Earlier analyses may be used where, pursuant to the tiering, program EIR, or other CEQA process, an
   effect has been adequately analyzed in an earlier EIR or negative declaration. Section 15063(c)(3)(D). In
   this case, a brief discussion should identify the following:

    a) Earlier Analyses Used. Identify and state where they are available for review.

    b) Impacts Adequately Addressed. Identify which effects from the above checklist were within the scope of
       and adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable legal standards, and state
       whether such effects were addressed by mitigation measures based on the earlier analysis.

    c) Mitigation Measures. For effects that are "Less than Significant with Mitigation Measures Incorporated,"
       describe the mitigation measures, which were incorporated or refined from the earlier document and the
       extent to which they address site-specific conditions for the project.

6) Lead agencies are encouraged to incorporate into the checklist references to information sources for
   potential impacts (e.g. general plans, zoning ordinances). Reference to a previously prepared or outside
   document should, where appropriate, include a reference to the page or pages where the statement is
   substantiated.

7) Supporting Information Sources. A source list should be attached, and other sources used or individuals
   contacted should be cited in the discussion.

8) This is only a suggested form, and lead agencies are free to use different formats; however, lead agencies
   should normally address the questions from this checklist that are relevant to a project's environmental
   effects in whatever format is selected.

9) The explanation of each issue should identify:

    a) the significance criteria or threshold, if any, used to evaluate each question; and

    b) the mitigation measure identified, if any, to reduce the impact to less than significance.

 I. AESTHETICS.
     Would the project:
     a) Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic            [ ]           [ ]          [X]          [ ]
        vista?
     b) Substantially    damage   scenic    resources,           [ ]           [ ]          [ ]          [X]
        including, but not limited to, trees, rock
        outcroppings, and historic buildings within a
        state scenic highway?
     c) Substantially degrade the existing visual                [X]           [ ]          [ ]          [ ]
        character or quality of the site and its
        surroundings?
     d) Create a new source of substantial light or              [X]           [ ]          [ ]          [ ]
        glare, which would adversely affect day or
        nighttime views in the area?

Comments:

The subject property does not affect any scenic vistas or damage any scenic resources given its
vacant nature, and will not obstruct whatever view of the mountains any properties to the south of -I-
210 freeway might have. In addition, the City of Claremont does not have any view protection
regulations.

All aspects of the proposed project's visual and design character will be subject to Architectural
Commission review and approval, in accordance with existing design criteria set forth in the
Claremont Land Use and Development Code (LUDC), prior to the commencement of any
development. The charge of the Architectural Commission will be to review the proposed
architectural design, exterior colors, materials and details, landscaping, signage and other design
features for compatibility and consistency with the City's design review criteria, and to not approve the
development plans unless these criteria are met.

However, the proposed project may have a significant visual effect in relation to the single-family
homes located to the north of the site and the lack of development adjacent the site. The project
consists of 6 buildings with the number of units ranging from 5 to 10 in each building; the total project
will have a gross floor area of 52,000 square feet. Each unit is a two-story townhome with an
attached two-car garage. The buildings immediately adjacent Base Line Road are setback 25 feet
from the public right-of-way. While the development of the site is consistent with the General Plan,
concerns have been voiced by the community about the aesthetic and light impacts the development
will have on the area, therefore; aesthetic and lights will be analyzed in the EIR for this project.

 II. AGRICULTURE RESOURCES.
    In determining whether impacts to agricultural
    resources are significant environmental effects,
    lead agencies may refer to the California
    Agricultural Land Evaluation and Site Assessment
    Model (1997) prepared by the California Dept. of
    Conservation as an optional model to use in
    assessing impacts on agriculture and farmland.
    Would the project:
     a) Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or               [ ]           [ ]          [ ]          [X]
        Farmland of Statewide Importance (Farmland),
        as shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the
        Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program of
        the California Resources Agency, to non-
        agricultural use?
                                                                  [ ]           [ ]          [ ]          [X]
     b) Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use,
        or a Williamson Act contract?
                                                                  [ ]           [ ]          [ ]          [X]
     c) Involve other changes in the existing
        environment, which due to their location or
        nature, could result in conversion of Farmland,
        to non-agricultural use?
Comments:

No farmland, agriculturally zoned, or Williamson Act property is affected by the proposed project. No
mitigation measures are required in the category of agricultural resources.

 III. AIR QUALITY.
     Where     available, the    significance     criteria
     established by the applicable air quality
     management or air pollution control district may be
     relied upon to make the following determinations.
     Would the project:
     a) Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the            [ ]           [ ]          [X]          [ ]
        applicable air quality plan?
                                                                   [ ]           [ ]          [X]          [ ]
     b) Violate any air quality standard or contribute
        substantially to an existing or projected air
        quality violation?
                                                                   [ ]           [ ]          [X]          [ ]
     c) Result in a cumulatively considerable net
        increase of any criteria pollutant for which the
        project region is non-attainment under an
        applicable federal or state ambient air quality
        standard (including releasing emissions, which
        exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
        precursors)?
                                                                   [X]           [ ]          [ ]          [ ]
     d) Expose sensitive receptors        to     substantial
        pollutant concentrations?
                                                                   [ ]           [ ]          [ ]          [X]
     e) Create objectionable odors             affecting   a
        substantial number of people?
Comments:

An EIR will be completed to assess potential air quality impacts the proposed development may
create or future residents experience due to the close proximity to the I-210 Freeway and the Towne
Avenue freeway on and off ramps.

Pursuant to the recently adopted General Plan, new development following the adopted Land Use
Plan densities could result in approximately 1,185 new dwelling units citywide during the life of the
General Plan. The proposed 45-unit development is included in this number; therefore the impact of
constructing 45 new units in the proposed location was analyzed at a programmatic level within the
completed General Plan.

Air Quality Setting

As stated in the General Plan Program EIR, Claremont is located within the South Coast Air Basin
(SCAB), which is comprised of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. The
SCAB experiences pollutant levels that exceed state and federal air quality standards, and
occasionally reach unhealthful levels. Ozone, the primary ingredient in photochemical smog, is the


INITIAL STUDY                                                                                    Page 10 of 38

biggest pollution problem in the area. The region's unique meteorological and climatic characteristics
are a major factor that contributes to the region's air quality problems. However, aggressive
emissions requirements have contributed to a steady improvement in air quality. Standards for
carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are not violated in Claremont. Ozone levels in the
Claremont area occasionally exceed state and federal standards, and will likely continue to do so well
into the 21st century; however, there have been no first-stage smog alerts since 1995.

Standards of Significance

Project-Generated Emissions

The SCAQMD CEQA Air Quality Handbook states that any project with daily emissions that exceed
any of the following thresholds should be considered to have an individually and cumulatively
significant air quality impact:

       55 lb per day of Reactive Organic Compounds (ROC)1
       55 lb per day of Nitrogen Oxide (NOX)2

Short Term Construction Air Quality Impacts

The proposed project consists of the demolition of the existing ~9,000 square-foot water reservoir in
the northwest corner of the site. According to Screening Table 6-3 in the CEQA Air Quality Handbook
prepared by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), the project would need to
involve more than 23 million cubic feet of building demolition and the construction of 975,000 square
feet of gross floor area to have a potentially significant air quality impact during development activities.
Based on the size of the proposed project, demolition of the 8,987 square-foot water tank and
construction of a 52,000 square-foot housing development, construction-related emissions will fall well
below the thresholds for significance.

Nonetheless, dust generated by construction activity could have a more direct effect on surrounding
properties to the north, and to freeway traffic to the south. To reduce air quality impacts in the
immediate vicinity of the project site, grading permits will include standard requirements for the
implementation of best management practices (BMPs), such as watering the site and covering
stockpiles of dirt, in order to control fugitive dust during construction activities. Specific mitigation
measures to control fugitive dust during construction will include the following:

Standard grading permit requirements to reduce air quality impacts in the immediate vicinity of the
project site will include the implementation of best management practices (BMPs), such as watering
the site and covering stockpiles of dirt, in order to control fugitive dust during construction activities.
Pursuant to SCAQMD Rule 403, the applicant shall also be required to secure any necessary permits
from the SCAQMD, including an approved fugitive dust emissions control plan, prior to the issuance of
grading permits.

No mitigation measures are required for construction-related impacts beyond the standard BMPs and
SCAQMD compliance required at all construction sites.

Long-Term Operational Impacts on Air Quality

During the life of a project, emissions produced by day-to-day operations will be comprised of
stationary source emissions (primarily energy consumption) and mobile source emissions from the
vehicle trips generated by the residents of the development. The mobile and stationary source
emission factors found in Tables 9-7 and 9-8 of the CEQA Air Quality Handbook were used to
calculate the estimated emissions in the following table:

Comments

No historic structures will be affected by the proposed project. The project site and immediate
surrounding vicinity are not recognized as an area having the potential for subsurface paleontological
or cultural resources. Since all above-ground and subsurface areas within the Project Site have been
disturbed by prior development, the likelihood for such resources is further diminished.

Since the project does not propose any subterranean levels and the site has previously been graded
to support previous agricultural uses, grading and construction activities are not expected to disturb
human remains. In the event any human remains are found during demolition or construction,
construction activities shall cease and further investigation/treatment will be followed as required by
state law. Compliance with existing regulations will ensure that no significant impact will result.

Earthquakes and Liquefaction

While no active earthquake faults have been confirmed within Claremont, and no Alquist-Priolo maps
have been adopted for the City, the Public Safety and Noise Element of the adopted General Plan
have identified the San Jose Fault as a potentially active fault within the City of Claremont. A
segment of the Sierra Madre fault is within very close proximity to the Project Site, as shown below.

Although all property in the City is subject to seismic activity, the Project Site may be subject to more
intense ground motion due to its proximity to a potentially active fault.

In accordance with existing local regulations, grading permits shall be required for new development
to ensure proper soil compaction and drainage. As standard procedure, grading and soil compaction
requires the preparation of specific grading plans, soils and geotechnical reports (which must address
liquefaction, subsidence, and other potential soil stability hazards), and hydrology studies which will
be reviewed and approved by the city engineer before any grading can occur. These plans will

ensure that the grading and drainage of the site will be in accordance with current engineering
standards and policies.

In addition, according to the most recent maps prepared by the State Geologist, the subject property
is located within an area that may be susceptible to liquefaction and/or is located on expansive soil
(see figure on next page). Liquefaction-prone soils pose significant hazards to structures and
inhabitants, based on these factors and Environmental Impact Report will be completed to address
any potential impacts.

The City of Claremont does not permit the installation of new septic tanks when sewers are readily
available. The proposed project will be connected to sewer lines in the area.

Comments:

An EIR will be completed to assess any potential impacts from the exposure to electromagnetic fields
(EMF's) due to the existence of the substation to the east and the existing high voltage utility poles on
the site.

Other than typical household hazardous materials (i.e., household cleansers), the proposed project
will not involve the use or transport of hazardous materials or release hazardous materials into the
environment.

The Los Angeles Fire Department provides plan check services to ensure that adequate access is
provided to the facility. Prior to issuance of building permits by the City, the project will be subject to
review and approval by the fire department for access, fire hydrant locations, and adequate water
flow. Thereafter, the facility will be subject to periodic inspections by fire department personnel.

The project site is not located in a high fire area, and is completely surrounded by urban development
or major roadways.

The project site is not included on the California Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC)
Hazardous Waste and Substances Site List (Cortese List).

The nearest airport is Cable Airport; this private airstrip is located approximately 1.9 miles to the east
of the subject property. The project site is not located in the Cable Airport land use plan clear zone.

The construction of 45 residential units on the project site will not impair implementation of or
physically interfere with an adopted emergency response plan due to the limited number of new
residences, not interfere with emergency evacuations using Base Line Road.

Figure 6-4 in the General Plan indicates that the project site is located in close proximity to a very high
fire hazard severity zone. To minimize potential fire danger the development will be required to
adhere to strict fire safety development guidelines and meet all required U.B.C. standards for fire
prevention (i.e. sprinklers, hydrants, etc).

Based on the above analysis, no mitigation measures are required in the category of hazards and
hazardous materials

Comments:
The project site contains no surface bodies of water, springs, or areas of natural seepage. As such,
the proposed development poses no threat to the quality or flow of surface or ground waters.
Moreover, the proposed development will not require major improvements to water supply or
distribution systems that could possibly affect local water supplies. Tsunamis do not pose a hazard
due to the inland location of the site. There are no nearby lakes, reservoirs, or other closed bodies of
water that could produce a seiche during a seismic event.

Drainage

Construction of the proposed building and parking areas will create impervious surfaces, and will
therefore increase the amount of surface runoff. This additional impervious surface will not create a
significant impact because the subject property has direct access to storm drain conveyances, which
have sufficient capacity to handle the added runoff to be created by the proposed project. These
conveyances include a concrete lined swale along the south property line, within the Caltrans right-of-
way, to handle the runoff that will flow to the rear of the site.

As a standard requirement for all new developments, the applicant shall be required to submit for
approval by the city engineer a comprehensive grading and drainage plan prior to the issuance of
grading and building permits. The plan shall be prepared by a registered civil engineer in
conformance with Chapter 70 of the Uniform Building Code and the City's standard grading
requirements. The drainage plan shall demonstrate how surface water will be collected on-site and
conveyed to existing storm drain facilities.

Also, in accordance with standard City requirements, a 50-year hydrology study shall be prepared in
conformance with the standards and requirements of the Los Angeles County Flood Control District
prior to the issuance of grading permits. The study shall address how potential grading, in conjunction
with the drainage conveyance systems, will assure that the proposed development will be safe from
inundation from rainfall runoff and protect downstream properties from drainage emanating from the
project site.

The creation of impermeable surfaces also has the potential to diminish the groundwater recharge
capabilities of lands where development occurs. However, the proposed project will have an minimal
effect on usable groundwater reserves, in that the area's usable groundwater recharge occurs within
the San Antonio Spreading Grounds, more than two miles to the northeast of the subject property.

Compliance with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit
The proposed project is subject to the requirements of the L.A. County's National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit, which includes, but is not limited to, the preparation of a Storm
Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), and the incorporation of Best Management Practices
(BMPs) for implementation during the construction phase of the project. The following is a summary
of the NPDES requirements that must be provided as part of the routine grading permit issuance and
inspection process:

   ·   The applicant is required to submit a SWPPP that incorporates BMPs for construction of the
       project for review and approval by the city engineer prior to the issuance of a grading permit.
       The plans shall be prepared in conjunction with the soils engineer and duly wet stamped by a
       registered civil engineer with expertise in complying with NPDES permit regulations.

   ·   The grading plan notes shall include applicable Best Management Practices (BMPs) in
       accordance with National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements, as
       identified in the California Storm Water Best Management Practice Handbook. Copies of
       BMPs and related information for land development improvement plans and construction
       activity are available from the Engineering Division.

   ·   The applicant shall sign and submit a Statement of Understanding affirming that the applicable
       BMPs will be implemented to effectively minimize the negative impacts of this project's
       construction activities on the surrounding water quality. Statement of Understanding forms are
       available from the Engineering Division.

In addition to compliance with the standard NPDES requirements described above, because the
project will result in the addition of more than 5,000 square feet of impervious surfaces, the applicant
shall also comply with the following provisions of Los Angeles County's Standard Urban Stormwater
Mitigation Plan (SUSMP):

   ·   The SUSMP includes the requirement for infiltrating or treating the volume of stormwater runoff
       from the first 0.75 inch of each storm event and of maintenance provisions for permanent Best
       Management Practices (BMPs), structural or treatment controls, through such means as may
       be appropriate (this could be accomplished within the proposed playground area).

   ·   The applicant shall certify that no illicit discharges will be released from the project site to the
       municipal storm drain system (gutters, streets, catch basins, storm drains, washes, flood
       control channels, and other conveyances, natural or man-made, that convey runoff to receiving
       waters).

   ·   The applicant shall certify that no illicit connections (connections that convey illicit discharges to
       storm drain system) shall be made.

   ·   The applicant shall implement sediment control-type BMPs to reduce the discharge of sediment
       to the municipal storm drain system. At least one type of sediment control BMP should be
       used. These include silt fencing and sand bags. (Note: City may allow substitution of these
       BMPs with catch basin inlet protection BMPs provided that (1) the project takes place during
       the dry season; (2) no excessive sediment is discharged to the street at any time during the
       project; (3) sediment discharged to the storm drain system is removed by the end of each work
       day).

Flood Hazards

Most of the City of Claremont has been developed on a foothill and along a downward slope, thus
flooding hazards are generally low. No property within the City lies within a federally designated 100-
year or 500-year flood zone. Figure 6-3 of the General Plan, San Antonio Dam Inundation, indicates
that the project site is located outside of potential dam inundation areas in the highly unlikely event the
San Antonio dam was to fail.

Based on the above analysis, and the established NPDES compliance criteria, no mitigation
measures are required in the category of hydrology and water quality.

        policy, or regulation of an agency with
        jurisdiction over the project (including but not
        limited to the general plan, specific plan, local
        coastal program, or zoning ordinance) adopted
        for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an
        environmental effect?
     c) Conflict with any applicable habitat conservation       [ ]           [ ]          [ ]          [X]
        plan or natural community conservation plan?
Comments:

The project site is bordered by the I-210 Freeway on the south and Base Line Road on the north.
While there is an established single-family residential community to the north of Base Line Road, the
construction of the new multi-family housing development will not divide the community as it is located
across the street and surrounded by an Edison substation to the east and a strawberry field to the
west.

The General Plan adopted on November 14, 2006 designates the project site for residential use with a
density of fifteen (15) units per acre. The current zoning designation for the property is RS 10,000; as
mandated by state law, the City is in the process of amending the zoning map to bring all existing
zoning citywide into conformance with the new General Plan. With the new General Plan, the zoning
on this property will be changing to RM 3,000 in the near future as part of the conformity change. The
amendment to the zoning map will modify the zoning designations of approximately 700 parcels in the
City.

California Senate Bill 1818 went into effect on January 1, 2005; this bill allows developers who provide
affordable units to receive a density bonus. A project can receive up to a 35% density bonus if the
project provides 10 percent of the units for very-low-income, 20 percent for low-income households, or
40 percent for moderate-low-income households. The proposed project will be a 100 percent
affordable housing for very-low-income and low-income households. The Residential 15 category
allows for both attached and detached units, townhomes and condominiums. As proposed the project
will have a density of approximately 17.3 units per acre, reflective of a density bonus of 1.15 percent.

The proposed project will therefore have no impact in the category of land use planning, and no
mitigation measures are necessary.

     b) Result in the loss of availability of a locally
        important mineral resource recovery site
        delineated on a local general plan, specific plan
        or other land use plan?
Comments:

Figure 5-3 of the General Plan Open Space, Parkland, Conservation, Air Quality Element shows that the
subject property, together with most Claremont property south of Mt. Baldy Road and Thompson Creek
Channel, is located within an area classified by the California Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG) as
Mineral Resource Zone 2 (MRZ-2). This designation indicates that either aggregate resource exists on
the site, or that there is a high likelihood that such resources exist. However, mining activities would be
incompatible with the surrounding urban uses. Also, according to General Plan Figure 5-3, the State
Mining and Geology Board does not consider the site to be an "area of regional significance" for meeting
the region's future mineral resource needs. Therefore, the proposed project will have no impact on the
availability of mineral resources and no mitigation measures are required in this category.

Comments:

Potential noise impacts associated with the proposed housing project are related to the below listed
sources. These topics will be analyzed within the EIR.

·      Noise generated during construction (short-term)
·      Exposure of future residents to freeway noise

Construction-Related Noise

The project will result in the increase of noise during the short-term period of construction. As with all
building projects within the City, the hours of construction and noise levels associated with the
development of the site will be subject to the standards contained in Chapter 5 Part 3 of the LUDC.
Construction activities that exceed adopted noise standards area allowed to occur between the hours of



INITIAL STUDY                                                                                    Page 29 of 38

7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday excluding national holidays. Construction related
activities (i.e. deliveries, work, staging, etc) that do not violate noise standards could take place outside of
those time periods.

As stated in the General Plan Program EIR the subject property is exposed to roadway noise from Base
Line Road to the north and the I-210 Freeway to the south.

Base Line Road noise is not significant noise generator (63-65 decibels at the building facade) per the
General Plan Program EIR. Although the freeway is depressed as much as 30 feet below grade to
mitigate noise impacts, numerous noise complaints have been logged since its opening in November of
2002. A noise impact assessment published by Urban Crossroads in 2004 concluded that the grooved
concrete pavement of the freeway surface is the primary factor responsible for actual noise levels
exceeding estimates prior to freeway construction. There is presently no sound attenuation wall along
the rear property line of the subject parcel.

Although the City of Claremont has no power to abate transportation noise at the source, it can require
projects to incorporate soundwalls and other means of noise attenuation to buffer the project site from the
noise source. The City of Claremont succeeded in executing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
between the City and Caltrans District 7 in 1999, which required, among other things, Caltrans to
construct soundwalls along the I-210 Freeway right-of-way prior to construction of the freeway. Pursuant
to the 1999 MOU, Caltrans constructed 12-foot or taller soundwalls along the segments of the I-210
Freeway abutting residential properties, as well as the nearby Montessori school at 560 Base Line Road.
Caltrans did not provide soundwalls adjacent to office or retail uses, or adjacent to commercially zoned
vacant parcels, or vacant land such as the subject property.

The General Plan EIR conducted a noise analysis on all areas in the City. The subject parcel presently
lies within a noise contour of 70 dBA. This site is projected to continue to experience noise at this level in
the future as documented in Figures 6-6 and 6-8 of the General Plan. Table 6-5 of the General Plan
established maximum exterior noise levels of 70 dBA for medium density multiple family land uses. A
noise impact analysis will be conducted as part of the EIR to determine the specific steps that need to be
taken to reduce the interior and exterior decibels experienced on the site.

Long-term Noise

The site is adequately separated from the nearby general aviation airport (Brackett and Cable) so that
persons residing within the new residential units will not be exposed to excessive noise levels from
aircraft.

 XII. POPULATION AND HOUSING.
        Would the project:
     a) Induce substantial population growth in an area,         [ ]           [ ]          [X]          [ ]
        either directly (for example, by proposing new
        homes and businesses) or indirectly (for
        example, through extension of road or other
        infrastructure)?
                                                                 [ ]           [ ]          [ ]          [X]
     b) Displace substantial numbers of existing
        housing, necessitating the construction of
        replacement housing elsewhere?
                                                                 [ ]           [ ]          [ ]          [X]
     c) Displace substantial numbers of people,
        necessitating the construction of replacement
        housing elsewhere?
Comments:

The proposed development was anticipated by the General Plan in terms of population and housing.
The General Plan, adopted November 14, 2006, addresses the need for additional affordable housing
in the City of Claremont, specifically low-income housing at the subject site. The proposal is
consistent with the intent and policies of the General Plan, providing 45 low income units.

The proposed location for the new housing development is on vacant land and will not result in the
displacement of people. While the new development will provide additional housing in the area, the
addition of 45 units will not result in a substantial population growth in the area. The City of Claremont
has an average family size of 3.08 persons and an average household size of 2.56 persons (2000
Census). The proposal will result in an addition of approximately 115-138 residents, depending on
which average size is used (~0.003 population increase). This population increase has been
analyzed within the General Plan EIR and is minimal.

No mitigation measures are required in the category of population and housing.

 XIII.   PUBLIC SERVICES.
         Would the project:
     a) Result in substantial adverse physical impacts
        associated with the provision of new or
        physically altered governmental facilities, need
        for new or physically altered governmental
        facilities, the construction of which could cause
        significant environmental impacts, in order to
        maintain acceptable service ratios, response
        times or other performance objectives for any of
        the public services:
         Fire protection?                                         [ ]           [ ]          [ ]          [X]

Comments:

The proposed use may have an impact on the availability of quality of public services such as police
protection and parks. An environmental impact report will address the potential impacts and provide
mitigation measures in these areas where necessary.

The development of the proposed 45-unit housing development will not have an impact on Fire
Protection. The City of Claremont contracts with the Consolidated Fire Protection District of Los
Angeles County for both emergency prevention and response services. Three County fire stations
are located in Claremont - Station 62 at 3710 Mills Avenue, Station 101 at 606 West Bonita and
Station 102 at 4370 Sumner Avenue. All new development is required to receive approval from the
LACFD to ensure that adequate fire protection can be provided. The development is subject to review
by the Fire Protection District to ensure the project meets all requirements for fire access to the site in
case of an emergency.

The project will have little impact on local public schools. According to the Program EIR for the
Claremont General Plan the Claremont Unified School District (CUSD) has a student generation rate
of 0.4 students per household. Based on the proposed 45 units, it is estimated the project will
generate 18 students, which will cause a limited impact on local schools.

     b) Does the project include recreational facilities or
        require the construction or expansion of
        recreational facilities, which have an adverse
        physical effect on the environment?
Comments:

The proposed 45-unit housing development will not increase the use of existing neighborhood and
regional parks or other recreational facilities such that substantial physical deterioration will occur. The
City of Claremont has an average family size of 3.08 persons and an average household size of 2.56
persons (2000 Census). The proposal will result in an addition of approximately 115-138 residents,
depending on which average size is used. This population has been analyzed within the General
Plan EIR and is minimal.

The project will provide recreation facilities on site for the residents; these facilities include a
recreational room, pool, sports court and tot lot, along with open space area. These new facilities will
not have an adverse physical effect on the environment. In addition to on-site facilities, nearby
recreational facilities such as the Thompson Creek Trail (accessed on Towne Avenue), and Griffith
Park, are within walking distance from the site. Due to previous public, comment this issue will be
reviewed as part of public services in the EIR.

Comments:

Traffic impacts associated with the proposed housing project will be analyzed within the EIR on the
topics of:

·    Updated traffic counts within the Project study area;
·    Analysis of the Towne Avenue/Base Line Road intersection;
·    Access into and out of the proposed development on to Base Line Road; and
·    Other factors as deemed warranted during the public scoping process and based on the expertise
     of the traffic consultants.

Trip Generation/Levels of Service

A vehicle trip is defined as a single or one-direction vehicle movement, with either the origin or the
destination (exiting or entering) inside a study site. Street system operating conditions are typically
described in terms of "Level of Service" (LOS). LOS is a report card type scale used to indicate the
quality of traffic flow on roadway segments and at intersections. Levels of Service range from A (free
flow, little congestion) to F (forced flow, extreme congestion).

The Circulation Element of the General Plan, contains a policy to allow new development only if the
resulting levels of service on affected major arterials do not fall below a daily LOS D and a peak hour
LOS E. Table 5.30 of the General Plan EIR analyzes the LOS for the Towne Avenue/Base Line Road
intersection. Currently the intersection has an existing LOS of "C", and with the future build out of the
estimated 1,185 dwelling units, the General Plan EIR anticipates that the LOS at this intersection will
remain at LOS"C". The ITE Trip Generation manual (7th Edition) provides a Weekday a.m. and p.m.
Peak Hour Generator of 0.73 trips per day for rental townhomes. Therefore, the 45 unit development
will have an estimated 33 a.m. and p.m. peak trips.

Parking

Each unit will have an attached two car garage and 12 uncovered parking spaces will be provided on
the site, a total of 102 spaces. The State Density Bonus Law imposes parking standards that allow
developers to provide fewer parking spaces than required by City code. These standards require 1
parking space for 0-1 bedroom units, 2 parking spaces for 2-3 bedroom units and 2.5 parking spaces
for units with 4 or more bedrooms. The project provides state parking requirements.

There will be no impact on air traffic patterns from this project and the development does not conflict
with programs supporting alternative transportation. The project is required to obtain approval from
the Los Angeles County Fire Department and Claremont Police Department to ensure adequate
emergency access on site is provided and maintained.                                                  .

       the project from existing entitlements and
       resources, or are new or expanded entitlements
       needed? In making this determination, the City
       shall consider whether the project is subject to
       the water supply assessment requirements of
       Water Code Section 10910, et. seq. (SB 610),
       and the requirements of Government Code
       Section 664737 (SB 221).

       the project that it has adequate capacity to
       serve the project's projected demand in addition
       to the provider's existing commitments?
    f) Be served by a landfill with sufficient permitted        [ ]           [ ]          [ ]          [X]

       waste disposal needs?
    g) Comply with federal, state, and local statutes           [ ]           [ ]          [ ]          [X]
       and regulations related to solid waste?
Comments:

The proposal will have a minimal impact on the above-referenced utilities and service systems, and
water supply impacts fall below the thresholds established by SB 610 and 221, state thresholds
multiplies by the number of units. The General Plan EIR addresses the water supply for the City of
Claremont as part of the General Plan EIR, Golden State Water confirmed that adequate supply will
be available to support planned land uses as outlined by the land use plan, including this proposed
development of 45 units.

Comments Continued:


All utilities are already present in the area to serve the project site, and there is sufficient capacity (or
there will be) to accommodate the needs of the proposed project. Existing regulations require new
development to connect to these services. As part of the permitting process for grading and on-site
improvements, the project proponent is required to submit to the city engineer hydrology and sewer
capacity studies to determine if upgrades or modifications to existing conveyances are necessary to
facilitate the proposed project.

As a standard requirement for all new developments, the cumulative impacts of the project on
drainage and sanitation facilities will be addressed through the assessment of drainage and sewer
facility fees. The fees are required by the City and the Los Angeles County Sanitation District to fund
needed improvements to the City's storm drain and sewer systems to reduce the cumulative impacts
caused by new development, and are apportioned to new development based on the new
development's fair share of the estimated costs of the improvements.

The solid waste generated by the demolition and construction activities at the project site, will
generate solid waste such as scrap wood and metal, drywall, cement, asphalt, etc. As with all
construction projects, the applicant will be responsible for collecting and properly disposing of waste
materials. The Building Division and Community Services Department routinely work with developers
to coordinate the recycling and export of demolition salvage, and the proper disposal of non-
salvageable demolition debris.

Based on the above analysis, no mitigation measures are needed in the category of utilities and
service systems.

                                          INTRODUCTION


The applicant proposes to develop a 45-unit multi-family residential development for low- and
very low-income residents on Baseline Road approximately 1,000 feet east of Towne Avenue in
the City of Claremont. The project would include 18 two-bedroom and 27 three-bedroom
homes. A vicinity map, an aerial photo of the proposed project site, and a site plan are provided
as Figures 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The area in the vicinity of the site consists of agricultural, utility, and residential uses. To the
north of the proposed development across Baseline Road are single-family homes, to the east is a
Southern California Edison substation, to the west is vacant land used as a strawberry field, and
to the south is the Interstate 210 (I-210) freeway.

The purpose of this air quality report is to describe the existing air quality in the project area,
identify applicable regulations, and identify potential air quality impacts that would occur with
implementation of the proposed project. The topic of global warming and project-related
emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is discussed. This report also identifies measures to
mitigate or minimize pollutant emissions that could occur during project construction and
operation.

The Initial Study (IS) identified the following potentially significant air quality impacts requiring
analysis in this report: possible exposure of sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant
concentrations. The IS concluded that the project does not have the potential to create
objectionable odors. Construction and operation related emissions are analyzed since the IS did
not address fine particles 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5), which is a
requirement of the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). Also since the
preparation of the IS, EMFAC2007 has replaced EMFAC2002 and the new emission factors are
required by SCAQMD for environmental impact analyses.

                                             SECTION 2.0
                                         PROJECT DESCRIPTION


The 45-Unit Affordable Housing Project proposes development of a 2.6-acre site on Baseline
Road for 45 two-story attached homes. The property is bounded by Baseline Road on the north,
a Southern California Edison substation on the east, property used for agriculture on the west,
and I-210 on the south. I-210 is also known as the Foothill Freeway. The I-210 off-ramp to
Towne Avenue is located between the project site and the main lanes of I-210; Towne Avenue is
approximately 1,000 feet west of the project site. The project site is in the City of Claremont.
The properties directly north of the site, on the north side of Baseline Road, are in an
unincorporated area of Los Angeles County.

In addition to the homes, the proposed project would include a common recreation area with a
swimming pool, recreation room, sports court, and tot lot. Construction of the proposed project
is anticipated to take 10 months to complete. Construction is anticipated to start in September
2008 and occupancy is assumed to be July 2009. The construction would include demolition and
removal of a 107-foot-diameter concrete water reservoir. Following demolition, grading would
require 1 month to complete. The remainder of the 10 months of construction would include
building foundations and structures, architectural coating (painting), paving, and landscaping.

For air quality evaluation, the project site and the City of Claremont are in the South Coast Air
Basin (Basin). The Basin is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the San Gabriel, San
Bernardino, and San Jacinto mountains to the north and east. It includes all of Orange County
and the nondesert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties.

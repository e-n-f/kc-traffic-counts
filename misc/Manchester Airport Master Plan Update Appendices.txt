1.0             AIRFIELD PAVEMENT CONDITION INDEX SCORES

The airport conducts annual pavement inspections for the purpose of determining the Pavement Condition
Index for the areas which are included in the study. PCI scores are based on a visual review of the pavement,
where the scores start at 100 (no distresses) and are reduced according to the length, width, area and severity
of distresses. The inspection process usually starts by breaking down the major runway, taxiway or apron
pavement areas into similar construction, condition and history sub-units or Sections, which are further broken
down into samples. A number of samples within each Section are then randomly chosen for inspection
purposes, and the average PCI of the sampled units is presented as the branch PCI. As of October 2009, the
majority of the latest PCI inspections were conducted during May and June 2009, with three of the inspections
dating to March and April 2008.

The Manchester Terminal Apron ASR Investigation study provided a system for associating PCI scores with a
subjective pavement rating on page 6 of the report, where:

                                             86-100 is considered Good
                                             71-85 is considered Satisfactory
                                             56-70 is considered Fair
                                             41-55 is considered Poor
                                             26-40 is considered Very Poor
                                             11-25 is considered Serious
                                             0-10 is considered Failed

The following Figure E1-1 defines the individual runway and taxiway branches which were used during the
PCI inspection and scoring process, which include Sections that have similar construction and history. Aprons
are not included in the PCI analysis.

The major runway and taxiway pavement branch/Section PCI are presented in Table E1-1, where the taxiway
areas include the three partial parallel taxiways ("A", "H" and "J") and the associated stub taxiways, and
Taxiway "M" which provides access to the Runway06 threshold from the terminal and air cargo areas. It
should be noted that several of the stub taxiways are included in the rating Section for the partial parallel
taxiway they connect to, and some of the taxiway connectors are included with other connecting taxiways.

Based on the subjective ratings for PCI scores, most of the major runway and partial parallel taxiway
pavements at MHT are in Satisfactory to Good condition, with four Sections in Fair condition. The connector
and stub taxiways at MHT are generally in Fair to Good condition.

All of the airport runway and taxiway Sections are constructed with an asphalt overlay on asphalt concrete,
except for a small Section of Taxiway "L" near the northeast hangar area which is asphalt.

The airport PCI program does not routinely include apron areas, where the apron condition is visually
inspected by airport personnel during snow removal operations. The concrete airline terminal apron was the
subject of a PCI analysis during the 2007 study of the apron's susceptibility to Alkali Silica Reaction (ASR)
distresses and deterioration. The apron PCI scores varied from 79 to 95, and suggest that the apron surface
is in satisfactory to good condition. The majority of the distresses impacting at least 1% of Section slabs were
in the "no" to "low" intensity range, and the predominant distress is low intensity map cracking/scaling. Figure
E1-2 depicts the terminal apron PCI sections. Table E1-3 describes the airline terminal apron PCI.

The study concluded that a significant portion of the concrete distresses and deterioration on the 1993
pavement areas (ATERM-01 and ATERM-02) were related to ASR conditions, and were expected to be a
problem in the future. Sections ATERM-03 and ATERM-04 did not show signs of ASR, but the possibility
existed in the presence of potassium acetate.

The major study recommendations include, but are not limited to:

           Short-Term repairs at 20 locations to eliminate Foreign Object Damage (FOD) potential and extend
           pavement life, concentrating on:

                 o    Medium-severity blow-ups
                 o    Medium-severity corner spalls
                 o    Medium- and high-severity joint spalls
                 o    Medium-severity partial-depth patches
                 o    Application of lithium to retard ASR, if resources allow, with monitoring of treated and
                      untreated areas to judge effectiveness

           Long-Term recommendations:

                 o    Patching and slab replacement every three years for medium- and high-severity distresses
                 o    New expansion joint along the trench drain, and monitor need for another trench drain

The study concluded that the ATERM-01 and ATERM-02 areas should continue to provide adequate service
for another ten years after implementation of the study recommendations. Areas ATERM-03 and ATERM-04
should provide the full design life which they were designed for (assumed to be twenty years).

1.0             AIRSPACE AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL

1.1             AIRSPACE STRUCTURE

Airspace in the United States is classified as controlled, uncontrolled, or special use as described in Table E2-
1. Controlled airspace describes airspace where air traffic control service is provided to IFR and VFR flights in
accordance with the rules of each airspace classification. Controlled airspace includes Class A through Class
E airspace, each of which has defined dimensions and altitudes within which air traffic control (ATC) service is
provided to IFR flights, and may extend to VFR flights in accordance with the airspace classification.
Uncontrolled airspace includes areas where ATC has neither authority nor responsibility to control aircraft, and
is classified as Class G airspace. An additional type of airspace, is special use airspace. This classification
consists of airspace where activities must be confined because of their nature, or where limitations are
imposed upon aircraft operations that are not part of the confined activities. Special use or restricted airspace
is clearly depicted on aeronautical charts.

                                                           TABLE E2-1
                                                    AIRSPACE CLASSIFICATIONS


                                                         Controlled Airspace
 Class A:       Generally consists of the airspace between 18,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) up to and including Flight Level
                600 (60,000 feet MSL), including the airspace above the U.S. coastal waters and within 12 nautical miles of
                the coast for the 48 contiguous states and Alaska, and designated international airspace. Class A airspace
                contains all high altitude airways and jet routes, and unless otherwise authorized all operations must be
                conducted under instrument flight rules (IFR). IFR flights are provided sequencing and separation from other
                IFR flights.
 Class B: Generally consists of the airspace from the surface up to as high as 10,000 feet MSL, and is found above the
          nation's busiest airports in terms of IFR operations or passenger enplanements. The configuration of each
          airport's Class B airspace is individually tailo red to contain all instrument procedures once an aircraft enters
          the airspace. The airspace consists of a surface area and two or more layers of increasing width at higher
          altitudes (may take on an upside-down wedding cake appearance). Air traffic control clearance is needed to
          enter or operate within the area and aircraft separation services are provided to all aircraft. Air Traffic Control
          provides sequencing and separation from other flights for IFR and VFR flights. Airports with Class B airspace
          also have a Mode C Veil, which extends from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL, covers the airspace within 30
          nautical miles of the Class B airport, and generally requires aircraft to have automatic pressure altitude
          reporting equipment with Mode C capability.
 Class C:       Terminal airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above airport elevation, which surrounds airports with
                control towers, radar approach control service, and a specified level of IFR operations or passenger
                enplanements. The configuration and shape for each airport is individually tailored, and usually is based
                around a surface that starts at the surface area and extends upward and within a 5 nautical mile radius, with a
                higher altitude circular segment with a 10 nautical mile radius that extends from no lower than 1,200 feet to
                4,000 feet above the airport elevation. Aircraft entering or operating within the area must establish two-way
                radio communications with air traffic control, and Air Traffic Control provides sequencing and separation from
                other flights for IFR and VFR flights
 Class D: Terminal airspace that extends from the surface to 2,500 feet above the airport elevation and protects the
           airspace around airports that have an open and operational control tower. The configuration and shape is
           individually tailored for the airport, and the airspace is designed to contain instrument procedures. Aircraft
           establish two-way radio communications with the air traffic control tower prior to entering the airspace, and
           while operating within the airspace. Air Traffic Control separation services are provided for IFR flights, and


W:\12008659_Manchester\MPU\Appendix E\Appx E2.doc             E2-1                           Airport Master Plan Update
                                                                                      Manchester-Boston Regional Airport
                are not available for VFR flights.
 Class E:      If airspace is controlled and does not fall into one of the preceding categories it is Class E airspace. Class E
                airspace is made up of several sub-categories, and may extend from the surface or an indicated altitude to
                the next controlled airspace area (which includes the 18,000 feet MSL floor of Class A airspace). Class E
                areas that start at 700' to 1,200' AGL above the Cl ass G airspace surrounding airports may serve as
                transitions to/from the terminal or en route environment. Class E airspace below 14,500 feet MSL is depicted
                on Sectional, Terminal and IFR Enroute Low Altitude charts. Air Traffic Control separation services are
                provided for IFR flights, and are not available for VFR flights.
                                                     Uncontrolled Airspace
 Class G: Occupies all airspace which is not within Class A-E airspace, where Class G airspace is not controlled and
           generally includes all low level airspace from the surface to the bottom of Class E airspace. The range of
           Class G airspace extends from the surface to 700' to 1200' AGL, or to 14,500' MSL in areas which are
           removed from airports. Air traffic control may provide basic information services to aircraft in radio contact.
                                                      Special Use
 Area of special concern or restrictions due to unusual hazards (e.g., military activity, gunnery).

Figure E2-1 addresses the shape of the airspace classifications which are discussed in Table E2-1 and
provides a summary of the different airspace characteristics.

Manchester-Boston Regional Airport is within Class C airspace, where the airspace is depicted in Figure E2-
2. The central Section extends outward 5 nautical miles from the center of Runway 17/35 in a circular shape,
and rises from the airport surface elevation to 4,300 feet MSL (circular tube shape). The second Section
extends from 5 to 10 nautical miles from the center of Runway 17/35, and includes elevations from 2,500 to
4,300 MSL. A third Section occurs within the second Section, is north-northwest of the airport, and includes
elevations from 2,000 to 4,300 feet MLS. The fourth Section occurs within the second Section, is south-
southeast of the Airport, and includes elevations from 1,500 to 4,300 feet MSL.

Manchester Class C airspace overlaps a small area of the Class E airspace associated with the instrument
approaches for Concord Airport, located about 8.5 nautical miles north-northwest of Manchester-Boston
Regional Airport. To the south, a small Section of the Manchester airspace, located about 8.5 nautical miles
south-southwest of the Airport, is within the Mode C Veil for Boston Logan International Airport (BOS). The
Mode C Veil boundary is located 30 nautical miles from BOS and extends from the surface to 10,000 feet
MSL. Unless otherwise authorized, aircraft operating within the Mode C Veil must be equipped with an
operating Mode C transponder having automatic pressure altitude reporting capability.                 The Mode C
Transponder is used to identify aircraft and their flight information on a radar screen, where this information is
provided to the air traffic controllers and displayed on the radar screens, and is essential to providing
appropriate aircraft separation.

Essentially the entire New England region surrounding the Airport, from southeast Maine through Connecticut,
which is not classified as Class B, C, or D airspace is classified as Class E airspace with a floor at 700' above
the surface and a top elevation at the base of the overlying Class A airspace. IFR aircraft within the Class E
airspace are provided separation from other IFR aircraft and participating VFR aircraft by Air Traffic Control.
Air traffic control typically provides alerts of non-participating aircraft to IFR aircraft.

The Manchester-Boston Regional Airport's Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) is located in the Ammon Center,
1,600 feet south of the interSection of Runways 17/35 and 06/24. The ATCT operates twenty four hours per
day, 365 days per year, and coordinates traffic located within the Airport Traffic Area, typically within five statue
miles of the Airport, as well as for aircraft taxiing on the airport surface and aircraft requiring IFR clearances.
Control of aircraft arrivals and departures prior to landing or immediately after takeoff are controlled by Boston
Approach and Departure Control. Other than standard separation of participating aircraft, Boston Approach
typically provides vectoring of IFR aircraft to final alignment with the runway prior to landing. Departure control
will provide vectors for aircraft to an initial departure gate to join the en-route flight plan.

MHT operations are significantly influenced by its proximity to BOS. Air Carrier Flights through Manchester
operate most often in three compass directions.

           West, (e.g. Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Minneapolis)

           Southwest (Las Vegas, Cincinnati, Memphis)

           South (e.g. New York Metro, Philadelphia, Charlotte, Orlando, Washington D.C., etc.)

Flights operating to the south are routed to avoid conflict with Boston airspace. As a result, air carrier turbojet
flights to or from the south must initially fly to west or northeast fixes prior to joining southbound airways.
Almost all arrivals enter the Manchester terminal area from the vicinity of the Keene VOR. Turbo prop
operations are handled differently and are usually cleared on more direct routes, as they tend to fly at lower
altitudes, thus avoiding the more congested jet routes.

1.3.1           PART 77 SURFACES DEFINED

To protect the safety of aircraft operations, the FAA defines and regulates the airspace surrounding airports in
Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace. Airspace is defined and
delineated by a set of geometric surfaces referred to as "imaginary surfaces," that extend outward and upward
from airport runways. These imaginary surfaces identify the maximum acceptable height of objects beneath
them. Figure E2-3 shows a diagram of the various surfaces included as Part 77 surfaces at MHT, as further
described below.

Surface slopes are expressed in terms of "run over rise" where a 40:1 slo pe, for example, represents a
surface which rises one foot in elevation for every forty feet of horizontal distance (40 foot run for every 1 foot
rise).

Primary Surface ­ The Primary Surface for all runways is 1000' wide with the edge parallel to runway
centerline. The primary surface extends 200 feet beyond the runway end and is at the same elevation as the
adjacent runway.

Approach Surfaces ­ The Precision Approach Surfaces for Runways 06, 17 and 35 start 200 feet from the
end of the runway, have an initial width of 1,000 feet, and slope upward at 50:1 for the first 10,000 feet and
then slope at 40:1 for an additional 40,000 feet. The slope is based on the distance along the extended
centerline. The width of the approach surface at 2,700 feet from threshold is 1,750 feet. The Non-Precision
Approach Surface for Runway 24 starts 200 feet from the end of runway, has an initial width of 1,000 feet, and
slopes upward at 34:1. It should be noted that Part 77 does not recognize displaced thresholds, which explains
why the surfaces start 200 feet from the end of the runway instead of 200' from the displaced threshold.

Horizontal Surface ­ The Horizontal Surface is defined by 10,000 foot arcs drawn from each runway end and
connected with tangents. The surface elevation is 150 feet above the highest runway elevation.

Transitional Surfaces ­ The Transitional Surfaces extend upward from the edges of the primary and
approach surfaces at a 7:1 slope, perpendicular to the runway centerline. They end at the Horizontal Surface
elevation. Above the Horizontal Surface, the 7:1 transitional surfaces for precision approaches extend
outward and upward from the 40,000 foot length of the 40:1 Approach Surfaces for a distance of 5,000 feet.
The slope is measured perpendicular to the runway centerline.

Conical Surface ­ The Conical Surface starts at the edge of the Horizontal Surface and extends upward at a
20:1 slope for a 4,000 foot distance. The slope is measured perpendicular to the closest horizontal surface
location.

1.1             PUBLISHED INSTRUMENT APPROACHES AND TERPS SURFACES

1.2             INSTRUMENT APPROACHES

Manchester-Boston Regional Airport has an extensive and sophisticated group of instrument approaches.
Approaches based on an FAA installed and maintained Instrument Landing System (ILS) are available to
Runways 06, 17 and 35. ILS approaches provide precise vertical and horizontal course guidance which helps
to line up the aircraft with centerline, and bring the plane down to the Decision Altitude and the corresponding
Height Above Threshold along a defined glide path. The approach lights on ILS runways 17 and 35 assist in
the early identification of the runway centerline, provide roll and distance information, and decrease the
allowable visibility minimums. The Required Navigation Precision (RNP) vertical guidance approach to
Runway 17 is a state-of-the-art approach, which is capable of using curved horizontal paths to the runway
centerline, reducing aircraft separation, and decreasing aircraft flight time and fuel usage. Table E3-1 shows
the straight-in instrument approaches to MHT along with the applicable weather minimums. The first listed
minimum is the "Height Above Threshold" (HATh) for vertical guidance approaches (ILS, LPV, RNP and
VNAV/LNAV), which is also the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) above runway for non-vertical guidance
approaches. The second minimum is the approach visibility (in statute miles) for values from 1 ½ to 2, and
Runway Visual Range (RVR) in hundreds of feet for figures from 06 to 60.

Note:           An italicized designation is given to identify which approach the minimums refer to, such as when the
                approach plate for Runway 35 RNAV (GPS) includes three different approach types.

Localizer Precision with Vertical guidance (LPV) approaches use ground augmented GPS signals to function
like an ILS. While they possess slightly less vertical signal accuracy than an ILS, the LPV approaches have
the potential to obtain minimums as low as 200 feet and ½ mile visibility. LNAV/VNAV instrument approaches
use GPS signals for the horizontal course and a computer generated glide path for approach guidance based


W:\12008659_Manchester\MPU\Appendix E\Appx E3.doc         E3-2                          Airport Master Plan Update
                                                                                 Manchester-Boston Regional Airport
on barometric pressure readings. LNAV also uses GPS satellite signals for lateral course guidance, and the
approach uses a stepped descent process. The non-precision stepped descent process requires aircraft to
stay at or above a specified altitude until they pass a specified "fix" location, after which, the pilot descends to
a lower altitude. After the Final Approach Fix is reached, the aircraft may descend to the Minimum Descent
Altitude and a landing may only be attempted if the pilot sees the runway end environment and a safe
approach is possible. VOR approaches use a vertical stepped descent procedure similar to LNAV where VOR
radials from a ground transmitter are used for horizontal guidance. The VOR signal is not as accurate as a
GPS signal, however. Localizer approaches use a precise horizontal signal for runway alignment and a
vertical stepped descent procedure.

While the Localizer, VOR, GPS and LNAV approaches at the Airport offer relatively high minimums compared
to ILS and LPV approaches, the latter types of approaches provide instrument access to many types of aircraft
that do not carry advanced instrumentation. The LPV approach appears to duplicate some of the instrument
approach access offered by ILS, which provides an important back-up if the ILS glide slope or localizer is out
of service for any reason.

Runway 24 is the only runway end at Manchester without a vertical guidance instrument approach. The
existing non-precision approach has relatively high ceiling and visibility minimums, especially for Approach
Category C/D business and commercial jets. Vertical guidance approaches such as ILS, LPV or RNP may
provide lower ceiling and visibility minimums, and also improve approach safety through reduced pilot
workload, positive vertical guidance during periods with reduced visual cues (IFR and night landings), and by
supporting stabilized approaches.

Trees in the Runway 24 approach appear to present significant obstructions to a number of critical clearance
surfaces for a vertical guidance instrument approach, including the Glidepath Qualification Surface (GQS) for
a 3.1 degree LPV approach. The GQS obstructions might be remediated by a moderate displaced threshold
on Runway 24 if tree cutting is not an option within a wetland and conservation area.

1.2.1           INSTRUMENT APPROACH RELATED WEATHER INFORMATION

Weather information is important to pilots, as it is a key determinant of which runway is optimally utilized
(aircraft operate best into the wind). This is particularly true if the airport is operating below Visual Flight Rule
(VFR) minimums due to a ceiling below 1,000 feet or visibility below three miles, and if an existing instrument
approach is above or below applicable weather minimums.

Weather condition information at the Airport is provided by an on-airport Automated Surface Observation
System (ASOS), and a Limited Aviation Weather Reporting Station (LAWRS). The Manchester ASOS is an
automated weather reporting system which is owned and maintained by the Federal government, and can be
accessed by telephone or by a radio capable of accessing the 119.55 frequency. The ASOS takes readings
for temperature, dew point, sky condition, altimeter, wind direction and wind speed at the ASOS site. The
ASOS issues time averaged weather results using a computerized human voice format. The ASOS visibility
reading is calculated from light attenuation measurements, is stated in terms of statute miles (plus fractions),
and is based on the night viewing of a moderate intensity light and daytime sighting of a dark object. The
Manchester ASOS is located in the infield area between taxiways "A", "D" and "G", about 480 feet east of the
airport terminal building.


W:\12008659_Manchester\MPU\Appendix E\Appx E3.doc       E3-3                           Airport Master Plan Update
                                                                                Manchester-Boston Regional Airport
LAWRS reports include cloud height, weather (rain, snow, etc.), obstructions to vision, temperature and dew
point, surface wind, altimeter and pertinent remarks. The observer based reports supplement the ASOS.
LAWRS visibility is based on the prevailing visibility around the airport, using lights at night and dark objects
during the day, and is given in statute miles with fractions.

Runway Visual Range (RVR) is an important reporting device at the Airport and the touchdown results are
directly used in 76% of the published instrument approach weather minimums. The RVR reports the
calculated distance that a pilot can see HIRL lights or runway markers when the plane is on or near the
surface, and are based on measurements of HIRL intensity, light attenuation and ambient light level. RVR
reports sighting distance in hundreds of feet (RVR 12 is 1200 feet) and, has a maximum reading of RVR 60
(6000 feet). RVR is reported when the visibility is 1 mile or less, or the RVR reading is 60 (6000 feet) or less.
RVR reports are included in ASOS and LAWRS weather announcements.

Since fog and snow impacts on runway sighting may vary along the length of the runway, several RVR are
located along each runway. The three RVR on Runway 17/35 are located at the Runway 17 and 35
touchdown points (about 1,000 feet past landing threshold), and close to the runway mid-point, providing
touchdown, mid-field and roll-out RVR for operations on both runways. The Category II and III ILS approaches
to Runway 35 require touchdown point, midfield and departure end RVR. An RVR is provided at the
touchdown points for Runways 06 and 24, and provides touchdown and roll-out RVR estimates for operations
on both runways.


1.3             TERMINAL INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES (TERPS)

Final Approach Obstacle Clearance Surfaces ­ Instrument approach minimums and limitations are based
on a number of obstacle clearance surfaces that apply to a specific approach type. Instrument Landing
System (ILS), Localizer Precision with Vertical guidance (LPV), LNAV/VNAV, and Required Navigational
Precision (RNP) approaches provide positive lateral and vertical guidance during the final approach segment,
presenting the pilot with a defined target that will bring the aircraft to the approach decision point. The "Height
Above Threshold" (HATh) decision point for vertical guidance approaches is based on the top elevation and
location of objects that obstruct an Obstacle Clearance Surface (OCS). If the final approach segment
surfaces are clear, the approaches may provide lowest possible minimums for the approach type if other
criteria are met including the missed approach.

Non-precision approaches at the Airport without positive vertical guidance, such as VOR, LOC (localizer only),
and LNAV (GPS lateral guidance without the benefit of WAAS improvements), depend upon stepped
decreases in allowable altitude at defined fixes and base the Minimum Descent Altitude on a required
clearance above the highest object in the final segment. Missed approach areas are also considered.

For ILS and LPV approaches, the final segment evaluation includes the W, X and Y surfaces, which are
addressed in Table E3-2 and Figure E3-1. The W, X and Y surfaces at MHT extend from 200 feet beyond the
landing threshold to the interSection of the glide path with the intermediate approach altitude ("d"=0 on Figure
5-3), which may occur at a distance less than or greater than 50,200 feet (the distance used for planning
purposes) from landing threshold. If the W, X and Y surfaces, as well as the missed approach and approach
light plane surfaces are clear, Category I ILS and LPV approaches may obtain minimums as low as 200 feet

The W surface slope for Runway 17 ILS is different from the ILS approach to Runways 06 and 35, due to the
glide path angles for each ILS approach. The Runway 06 and 35 W surfaces have a 34:1 slope (102/3.00),
while the W surface for Runway 17 has a 32.91:1 slope (102/3.10) due to a 3.10 degree glide path angle.

For RNP approaches, the criteria is different from ILS/LPV due to increased reliance on GPS/WAAS signal
accuracy at low RNP values, and the use of barometric pressure to generate a vertical guidance path. The
RNP surfaces are rectangles centered on the approach course as shown in Figure E3-2, where the half-width

of the final segment rectangle is a function of the required approach RNP (2 x RNP), and the OCS starting
slope location is a function of airport and approach variables.

While the RNP OCS starts 200 feet from the landing threshold, the sloping Section generally starts at a
distance Dveb from threshold, which is usually from 1500 feet to 3000 feet in length. The OCS slope is
generally about 20:1. Objects within the initial zero slope area and above threshold may increase the HATh
above 250 feet, which is the lowest possible HATh with RNP.

For the RNP 0.11 approach to Runway 17, the OCS half-width from centerline is 0.22 nautical miles (RNP is
always expressed in terms of nautical miles), and the half width of the RNP 0.30 approach is 0.6 nautical miles
(3645.6 feet) from centerline. While the RNP approach to Runway 17 results in higher approach minimums
than the ILS or LPV approaches, RNP provides benefits in terms of closer aircraft spacing within the airspace,
which can reduce delays and decrease fuel use.

For the non-precision approaches based on LOC, VOR and LNAV, the width of the final approach segment
surfaces at the landing threshold and in the approach are considerably larger than ILS, LPV or RNP, and the
Minimum Descent Altitude is determined by adding 250 feet (plus modifiers) to the highest object elevation in
the area. Thus, the highest point on objects which rise to a relatively high elevation but which are below the
W, X, and Y surfaces may significantly raise non-precision minimums but result in relatively low ILS or LPV
HATh.

                                                                            Manchester-Boston Regional Airport
TERPS Paragraph 251 Visual Area ­ The lowest visibility that an instrument approach may obtain, and the
ability to use the approach at night, is based on the Visual Area criteria set forth in Paragraph 251 of FAA
Order 8260.3B. The Visual Area surfaces at MHT start 200 feet from the landing threshold, where they have
an 800 foot total width, and the surface extends out to the Decision Altitude location. The total surface width
for instrument approaches lined up with runway centerline is a function of distance from start, and equals 800
feet + (0.276 x the distance from surface start).

The criteria associated with the various Visual Area surface slopes are:

           If the 34:1 slope Visual Area surface is penetrated, the visibility minimums may not be less than ¾
           mile. If the 34:1 slope surface is clear, visibility minimums less than ¾ mile may be approved with the
           prescribed runway and approach lighting.

           If the 20:1 slope Visual Area surface is clear, the visibility minimums may be less than 1 mile.

           If the 20:1 slope Visual Area surface is penetrated, visibility minimums cannot be less than 1 mile, and
           night authorization for the approach may be withheld unless the obstructions are removed, marked
           and lighted, or FAA approves remediation via a visual glide slope.

           If the number of 20:1 penetrations is unusually high, FAA may withhold night authorization even if
           lighting/marking and a visual glide slope are in place.

Glidepath Qualification Surface ­ Vertical guidance instrument approaches (ILS, LPV and RNP) cannot be
approved if the Glidepath Qualification Surface (GQS) has obstructions. The GQS surfaces at MHT extend
from the landing threshold to the Decision Altitude (DA) location, with a slope equal to                  1
                                                                                             Tan(2  (GlidepathA ngle  3))
For Runways 06 and 35 the GQS slope is 28.64:1, and the slope for Runway 17 is
27.72:1. The GQS for Runways 06 and 17 starts at the runway threshold elevation, while the Runway 35 GQS
starts 1 foot above the threshold elevation due to a 51 foot Threshold Crossing Height (TCH). The GQS
starting elevation is raised one foot for every TCH foot above 50.

The GQS starting width is 200 feet greater than the runway width, for a 350 feet total starting width for all
runways at MHT, and the DA location width of the GQS is equal to the W surface width at the DA:

           1063.12' GQS width at Runway 06 CAT I ILS DA
           986.35' GQS width at Runway 17 CAT I ILS DA
           990.31' GQS width at Runway 35 CAT I ILS DA
           852.92' GQS width at Runway 35 CAT II ILS DA

GQS obstructions may be remediated in some cases by increasing the TCH above 50 feet. Changes to the
TCH, up to 60 feet above threshold, may be used without glidepath angle modifications when obstructions are
10 feet or less above the GQS.

TCH modifications can also be used in conjunction with the application of glidepath angles above 3 degrees (3
degrees is the standard starting glidepath angle), since increases in the approach angle change the GQS



W:\12008659_Manchester\MPU\Appendix E\Appx E3.doc       E3-7                          Airport Master Plan Update
                                                                               Manchester-Boston Regional Airport
slope. It is important to note that increasing the TCH will reduce the available landing length, and 60 feet is
the normal TCH maximum without a special FAA waiver. Glidepath angles above 3.1 degrees limit the aircraft
which are authorized to use vertical guidance approaches in accordance with the following guidelines
contained in FAA Orders 8260-3B and 8260-54A:

           Glidepath angles up to 3.1 degrees: May be used by Approach Categories A-D
           Above 3.1 degrees and up to 3.6 degrees: Approach Categories A-C (Category D not authorized)
           Above 3.6 degrees and up to 4.2 degrees: Approach Categories A-B
           Over 4.2 degrees: Approach Category A

Since MHT is regularly used by aircraft in Approach Categories C and D, care should be taken when glidepath
angle changes from 3 degrees are considered to obtain clearances over obstructions that cannot be removed.

Precision Obstacle Free Zone ­ The Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ) applies when the weather
conditions for a vertical guidance instrument approach are less than 250 feet HATh, or the prevailing visibility
is less than ¾ mile (or RVR 4000). The POFZ extends from the landing threshold to 200 feet out, and has a
total width of 800 feet. Taxiing, holding and parked aircraft, and ground vehicles within the POFZ are
considered to be obstacles unless positive control will allow the surface to be cleared when aircraft are within 2
nautical miles of the threshold and the reported minimums are below 300 feet or ¾ mile (RVR 4000).

The POFZ is considered clear if the tail and/or fuselage of a taxing aircraft do not penetrate the zone. The
wing of aircraft holding on a perpendicular taxiway, while they wait for runway clearance, may penetrate the
POFZ. If the POFZ is penetrated when an aircraft is on its final approach and is within 2 nautical miles, the
lowest approach minimums are 300 feet and ¾ mile.

Departure Surface ­ Departure minimums are published for each runway end at MHT, and are derived from
the departure surface analysis. If the departure surface is clear of obstructions, the runway end may obtain
standard departure minimums which consist of 1 mile visibility for two engine aircraft, and ½ mile visibility for
aircraft having more than two engines. If the departure surface has obstructions, the departure minimums are
based on the ceiling and visibility which will allow pilots to see and avoid obstacles. Alternate departure
minimums may also be published that allow the use of the standard departure minimums if a specified aircraft
climb gradient may be obtained, where the needed climb gradient is sufficient to obtain adequate clearance
over obstacles.

The Initial Climb Area (ICA) departure surface at MHT starts at the departure end of runway where it has a
1,000 foot width, and the width reaches 7,512.36 feet at a distance of 2 nautical miles (12,152.23 feet). The
40:1 surface slope which is depicted in TERPS is associated with a 200 foot per nautical mile climb gradient,
and the slope becomes steeper if the minimum climb gradient is increased to obtain the required clearance
over obstacles.

The departure obstructions for Runways 17 and 35 at MHT require that specified ceiling and visibility
minimums be met to allow pilots to see and avoid the obstacles, and alternate departure minimums are
published that require a climb gradient above 200 feet per nautical mile. Runway 06 and 24 departures may
use standard departure minimums.

Lower than standard departure minimums, which may range from an RVR of 1600 feet to an RVR equal to or
lower than 600 feet, must be authorized by the FAA for individual airline certificate holders, by aircraft type,
and for other operators. The general runway requirements for lower than standard departure minimums for
Part 121 Airplane Operations are shown in Table E3-4. The required takeoff aids may include operative
centerline lights, operative high intensity edge lights, serviceable centerline markings and one or more RVR. If
available, RVR reports from specified locations along the departure runway must be used for takeoff
operations in place of prevailing visibility or ASOS/AWOS estimates.

MHT has lower than standard takeoff minima of RVR 500 on Runways 17 and 35, and RVR 1000 on Runways
06 and 24. The RVR 1000 departure minimums on Runway 06/24 are higher than would normally be
associated with a runway served by HIRL, centerline lights and touchdown zone/roll-out RVR.

In accordance with the Surface Movement Guidance Control System (SMGCS) plan which was prepared by
the airport and is dated March 2009, Part 121 airline takeoffs and departures are limited to weather conditions
where the RVR is 600 or higher, and Part 121 operations are restricted to Runway 17/35 when the RVR is
below 1200. The SMGCS plan is required for Part 121 airline operations in conditions below RVR 1200, and
identifies the special ground facilities, operating procedures and designated taxi paths which must be adhered
to. The following Figure E3-3 identifies the low visibility taxi routes at the airport, including the holding position

belly of scheduled passenger flights ("belly cargo"), and all-cargo carriers provide both scheduled and on-
demand flights. Table E4-1 shows the cargo landed weight at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport for the
past five years.

1.1             ZONING AND LAND USES ADJACENT TO THE AIRPORT

There are a large number of land-use zones applicable to the areas surrounding the Airport in the City of
Manchester, Town of Londonderry and the Town of Bedford. Figure E5-2 shows a map of the City of
Manchester zoning areas. Table E5-2 shows the applicable zones and permissible uses within the City of
Manchester, while Table E5-3 shows the overlay district zones and purpose. Zoning and overlay district
information for the Town of Londonderry is shown in Tables E5-4 and E5-5, and Table E5-6 shows the zoning
districts within the Town of Bedford. Figures E5-3 and E5-4 shows the zoning district and applicable overlay
districts for the Towns of Londonderry and New Bedford, respectively.

The City of Manchester Zoning Map as shown in Figure E5-2 also includes ten overlay districts, where the
districts are identified as to purpose in Table E5-2. Three of the district overlays apply to the airport. The
overlay districts are superimposed upon the base districts and the overlay district provisions apply in addition
to the base district provisions.

The Town of Londonderry zoning map is shown in Figure E5-3, and information on the zoning codes and
permitted uses is provided in Table E5-3. The zoning codes include an Airport District, which provides
standards for certain airport related use and structures that are not compatible with generally applicable
commercial and industrial standards. The general standards within the Town of Londonderry Airport District
provide criteria for building setbacks, a maximum building height of 65 feet for structures (exceptions: terminal
building, airport parking garage and aircraft control tower), storage areas, sewage and waste disposal, curb
and gutter, sidewalks, electrical power, and parking standards. Proposed airport development within the
Airport District must meet the standards of the Town Site Plan Regulations for surface water drainage control,
and a permit application must be submitted to the Town engineer simultaneously with submittal to the state
and/or federal agencies having jurisdiction over the development.

The Town of Londonderry overlay districts and permitted uses are identified in Tables E5-4 and E5-5, where
two of the overlay districts pertain to the airport.

The Town also includes a Historic District which currently includes five lots which are defined in the Zoning
Ordinance. The Historic District is superimposed upon other established districts, where uses permitted in
underlying districts are permitted within the Historic District. The purpose of the Historic District is to
safeguard and preserve the heritage of the Town for the benefit of residents and businesses.

The Town of Londonderry Northwest Small Area Plan, which was published and adopted by the Town during
September, 2009, includes three airport related overlay districts which are shown in Figure E5-4.

                                            To maintain reasonable visibility and navigational control in the vicinity of
                                            Manchester Airport by precluding buildings, structures, trees or other

                                            To prevent the penetration of buildings, structures, trees or other

                                            overlay district boundaries are based on the ultimate future expansion
                                            and orientation of runways planned for the Airport.
                                            To avoid the establishment of land uses in the vicinity of Manchester
                                            Airport that are incompatible with the noise levels generated by the take

                                            public costs for land acquisition and noise mitigation by identifying and

                                            soundproofing for compatible new development that may be affected by
                                            Airport noise.
                                            To develop an area that is compatible with and complimentary to the
                                            Civic Center. This can be accomplished by creating an area which is

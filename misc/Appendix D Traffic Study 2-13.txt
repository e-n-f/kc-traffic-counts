Executive Summary

The Olson Company is proposing to develop a 44 unit residential project on the
northeast corner of Valencia at Woods in the city of Fullerton. The city has
requested that the specific traffic impact issues be analyzed:

      Level of Service (LOS) analysis of Valencia at Euclid.

      The Project will not have a significant traffic impact on the intersection of
      Valencia at Euclid for either 2015 or 2030 conditions.

      Traffic controls for the intersection of Valencia at Woods.

      The intersection is currently controlled by stop signs on all 4 of its
      approaches. The intersection will not warrant signalization for any of the
      scenarios that have been studied.

      Storage requirements for eastbound left turn ingress vehicles on Valencia
      to the Project site. This issue needs to be reviewed in consideration of
      limited left turn lane storage capacity.

      The analysis shows that vehicle queues for eastbound left turn ingress are
      highly unlikely to materialize for either 2015 or 2030 conditions. Left turn
      storage capacity will be adequate.

Project Traffic Circulation Issues

TEP contacted the city traffic engineering consultant, Mark Miller of AGA to
identify issues that need to be addressed in the traffic study for the Project. The
following specific issues have been identified:

      Level of Service (LOS) analysis of Valencia at Euclid.

      Traffic controls for the intersection of Valencia at Woods.

      Storage requirements for eastbound left turn ingress vehicles on Valencia
      to the Project site. Issue needs to be reviewed in consideration of limited
      left turn lane storage capacity.

Project Description

The Project location is shown on Figure 1 and the Project site plan is shown on
Figure 2.

The Project is a residential development that proposes 44 residential units on a
3.5 acre lot. Of the 44 proposed residential units, 36 are single family detached
homes and 8 are duplex townhomes.

The Project site is located on the north side of Valencia Dr., east of the
intersection at Woods Avenue in the city of Fullerton. The Project site is adjacent
to Independence Park.

Access to the Project site will be provided from a single roadway on Valencia.
The Project access roadway will be approximately 157 feet east of the
intersection of Valencia at Woods. The access roadway will not be gate
controlled.

Circulation System

Figure 3 shows the geometry and traffic controls of the intersection of Euclid at
Valencia. Figure 4 shows the geometry and traffic controls the intersection of
Woods at Valencia.

Euclid Street at Valencia Drive

The intersection of Euclid Street and Valencia Drive is controlled by a traffic
signal. All four legs of the intersection have crosswalks. The northwest,
southwest and southeast corners are occupied by commercial uses. The
northeast corner is occupied by the Department of Motor Vehicles.

Both Euclid Street and Valencia Drive are 64 feet wide, and are designated as
Primary Arterials in the city general plan. Valencia Drive extends from 1.6 miles
east of Euclid Street to the west city boundary. Euclid Street extends through
both the northern and southern city boundaries. Northbound and southbound
Euclid Street has two through lanes and a left turn lane at the intersection.
Valencia Drive has one through lane, plus one dedicated right turn lane and one
dedicated left turn lane in each direction. 180 ft north of the intersection the grade
begins to dip to pass under the railroad tracks. The speed limit on both Euclid
Street and Valencia Drive is 35 mph.

Valencia Drive and Woods Avenue

The intersection of Valencia Drive and Woods Avenue is currently controlled by
all-way stop controls. The east leg of the intersection has a crosswalk. The exit
from Independence Park is treated as a fourth leg of the intersection (although it
is offset from Woods by 33 feet). The stop signs are all accompanied by plaques
that indicate 4-way Stop. A driveway is directly across from Woods Avenue on
Valencia Drive. Four intersection related collisions occurred from 2009 through
2011.

The north end of Woods Avenue terminates at Valencia Drive and extends 0.85
miles south to the 91 Freeway. Woods Avenue is 36 feet wide residential street.
The speed limit is a prima facie 25 mph for a residence district.

Eastbound and westbound Valencia Drive has one through lane, one left turn
lane and a bike lane at Woods Avenue. Valencia Drive extends from 1.3 miles
east of Woods Avenue to the west city boundary. The speed limit on Valencia
Drive is 35 mph.

INTERSECTION TRAFFIC CONTROL & GEOMETRY
               FIGURE 4
Project Trip Generation

The Project trip generation is shown on Table 1. The Project trip generation has
been calculated using trip generation rates from the ITE Trip Generation Manual,
9th Edition.

Project Trip Distribution

The Project trip distribution is shown on Figure 5. The trip distribution pattern has
been approved by AGA. Figure 6 shows the Project trips based on the
distribution pattern shown on Figure 5.

The Project does not contribute 50 or more peak hour trips to any state highway.
Therefore, the SR-91 ramps at Euclid were not evaluated.

Traffic Forecasts

Table 2 is a spreadsheet which shows the traffic forecasts based on the
methodology described below.

2015 Forecasts

The 2015 forecasts are based on the traffic counts collected in November and
December of 2012 (see Appendix 1). A growth factor has been applied to the
2012 counts of 1% per year (approximately 3% for the years 2012 through 2015),
accounting for ambient growth. The city traffic consultant (AGA) has provided a
forecast of additional traffic entering the study area intersections, accounting for
additional traffic that will be generated by new development. These new
developments include a car wash and a residential development.

In summary, the 2015 forecasts are calculated as follows:

       2012 traffic count *1.03 (ambient growth) + cumulative growth =
       2015 Background Forecast

       2015 Background Forecast + Project Generated Traffic =
       2015 Traffic Forecast with Project

2030 Forecasts

AGA has recently completed citywide traffic forecasts for a general plan study of
the city of Fullerton, including the intersection of Euclid at Valencia. This forecast
is the background forecast for 2030.




                                          8
Since the adoption of the general plan, one additional project has been
approved, which is added to the base 2030 background forecasts. This is a new
car wash located south of the intersection of Euclid at Valencia.

Project generated traffic is added to the 2030 Background Forecast to create the
2030 traffic forecast with project.
In summary, the 2030 forecasts are calculated as follows:

      2030 Fullerton traffic model forecast + cumulative growth =
      2030 Background Forecast

      2030 Background Forecast + Project Generated Traffic =
      2030 Traffic Forecast with Project

For the intersection of Valencia at Woods, there are no traffic model forecasts.
The 2030 Background Forecast was built from existing approach traffic counts,
plus cumulative background traffic provided by AGA.

Level of Service Analysis of Valencia at Euclid

Per the direction of AGA staff, LOS analysis was conducted utilizing the
WEBSTER software. In addition, AGA staff provided the signal timing parameters
to be used in the analysis of the intersection of Valencia at Euclid.

LOS Standard and Significant Impact Threshold Criteria

Traffic impacts for a given intersection are identified as significant if the proposed
project results in a significant change in traffic conditions at that intersection. The
significant impact criterion provided below is based on the City of Fullerton's
traffic study guidelines. The threshold to determine significant traffic impact for
purposes of this project is as follows:

¨    An intersection impact is considered to be significant if the project causes an
    intersection at LOS D or better to move to LOS E or F.

LOS Analysis

The intersection LOS analysis is summarized on Table 3. The WEBSTER
intersection analysis reports are included in Appendix 2.

Traffic Controls for the Intersection of Valencia at Woods

The intersection of Valencia at Woods is currently controlled by stop signs on all
4 of its approaches. The intersection has been analyzed to determine if it
warrants signalization based on the Caltrans peak hour signal warrant (Warrant
3). This analysis is shown on Table 4.

The intersection will not warrant signalization for any of the scenarios that have
been studied.

Storage Requirement for Eastbound Left Turn Project Ingress

One issue requiring analysis is the storage requirements for eastbound left turn
ingress vehicles ingressing to the Project site on Valencia. This issue needs to
be reviewed in consideration of limited left turn lane storage capacity.

The distance between the roadway providing access to the Project site and the
intersection of Valencia at Woods is approximately 157 feet. Valencia between
these 2 points is striped as a two-way left turn lane, and would be needed to
provide storage capacity for vehicles ingressing to the Project site and
westbound left turning vehicles at the intersection of Valencia at Woods.

Vehicle Arrival Rate

The p.m. peak hour is the period of peak demand for vehicles ingressing the
Project site and for westbound vehicles, which conflict with the eastbound left
turning vehicles, and thereby constrict the flow of these vehicles.

During this period, 20 vehicles per hour will turn left from Valencia to enter the
project site. This equals and arrival rate of .33 vehicles per minute.

Minimum Gap Requirement

The minimum gap in the westbound flow of traffic on Valencia needed for left turn
ingress traffic to the project site has been determined based on a calculation of
the number of seconds it takes a vehicle to accelerate from a full stop to 10 mph.
An acceleration rate of 9.2 feet per second2 has been used in this calculation.
This acceleration rate is typical of the acceleration profile of a low-power
passenger vehicle (Source: Traffic Engineering Handbook, Fifth Edition, Institute
of Transportation Engineers, pg. 63).

The width of the westbound through lane is 14 feet. This is the distance that must
be cleared for vehicles ingressing to the Project site from the 2 way left turn lane.
The arc length from the median is approximately 22 feet. It takes approximately
2.2 seconds for a vehicle with an acceleration rate of 9.2 feet per second2 to
travel 22 feet from a full stop. (Note: many, if not most, vehicles entering the east
curb driveways will not need to stop before traversing the northbound lanes, and
will accomplish the maneuver in less than 2.2 seconds.)

To account for variables in driver reaction time, this analysis assumes a minimum
gap requirement of 3 seconds.

Queue Analysis

The queue analysis for eastbound left turn ingressing vehicles to the project site
is shown on Table 5 based on the vehicle arrival rate and minimum gap

requirement. The analysis is for 2015 and 2030 conditions. The analysis shows
that vehicle queues are highly unlikely to materialize for either 2015 or 2030
conditions.

Project Title: SCWMA Compost Facility

Project Applicant: Sonoma County Waste Management Agency

Date: October 4, 2012

The Sonoma County Waste Management Agency (SCWMA), as the lead agency under the California
Environmental Protection Act (CEQA), has prepared a Recirculated Draft Environmental Impact
Report (RDEIR) for the SCWMA Compost Facility. This RDEIR addresses an increase in the amount
of material processed at the Central Site Alternative from 110,000 tons per year (analyzed in the
"2011 Draft EIR) to 200,000 tons per year (analyzed in this Recirculated Draft EIR). To assure
that all the resource areas are appropriately analyzed, all the resource areas for the Central Site
Alternative are reviewed in this RDEIR for impacts related to the increased capacity and operational
changes. As to the increased throughput, recirculation of the entire 2011 Draft EIR is not required
because other sites (Sites 5A and 40) were already analyzed for 200,000 tons per year.

The Central Site Alternative would include a compost facility with a pad area of approximately
22 acres that would require initial grading and disturbance of approximately 34 acres on the 400-acre
Central Disposal Site property, located approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the City of Cotati,
off of Mecham Road. After additional review of the site design and other aerated static pile (ASP)
composting processes (e.g., covered aerated static piles), it was determined that the throughput
goal of 200,000 tons per year could be reached by using cutting edge technologies such as the use of
cement push walls, special covers, positive air pressure, and oxygen and temperature gauges connected
to a computer system that manage the air pressure and allow for additional tons of materials to be
composted on less space than with traditional windrow or other ASP composting processes.

The objectives for the proposed project are the relocation of the SCWMA's composting operations
from its current location (on top of an area that has previously been landfilled) at the County's Central
Disposal Site; the establishment of a permanent composting facility in Sonoma County with sufficient
capacity for current and future quantities; and to assist jurisdictions within SCWMA's service area in
meeting the goals and objectives for waste diversion as set forth in the California Integrated Waste
Management Act of 1989 (AB 939).

Significant adverse environmental impacts

The following significant adverse impacts associated with the Central Site Alternative would be
unavoidable, even with the implementation of the mitigation measures identified in this RDEIR:

Central Site Alternative

     Impact 28.2 - The Central Site Alternative could conflict with the Sonoma County
     General Plan or Zoning Ordinance. In most cases, the alternative would not conflict with
     the General Plan or Zoning Ordinance, however, as identified in Impact 29.2, the Central
     Site Alternative could expose persons to or generate noise levels in excess of standards in
     the General Plan.
     Impact 29.2 - Operation of the Central Site Alternative composting facility could expose
     persons to or generate noise levels in excess of standards established in the local general
     plans or noise ordinances, or applicable standards of other agencies.
     Impact 31.5 - Long-term cumulative traffic volumes from this alternative would have a
     significant impact to traffic delays at the Gravenstein Highway (SR 116) / Stony Point
     Road intersection. Mitigation Measure 31.5 would reduce the impact to less than significant.
     However, if implementation of Mitigation Measure 31.5 is not approved by Caltrans (the
     jurisdiction responsible for SR 116), the impact would be Significant and Unavoidable.
RDEIR Availability, Commenting Procedures, and Meeting on RDEIR

The RDEIR is available for a 45-day public comment period from October 4, 2012 through
November 19, 2012. Copies of the RDEIR are available to the public for review or purchase at
the SCWMA office in Santa Rosa (2300 County Center Drive, Suite B100, Santa Rosa, CA
95403) and available for review at local libraries throughout the County. Electronic copies of the
RDEIR and also the previous December 2011 Draft EIR are available online at:

Introduction

Partial Recirculation of an Environmental Impact
Report
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that all state and local government
agencies consider the environmental consequences of programs and projects over which they
have discretionary authority before taking action on those projects or programs. Where there is
substantial evidence that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the agency
shall prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) (CEQA Guidelines, Section 15064[f][1]).
An EIR is an informational document that will inform public agency decision makers and the
general public of the significant environmental effects of a project, identify possible ways to
minimize the significant effects, and describe reasonable alternatives to the project.

CEQA requires that a Draft EIR be prepared and circulated for public review. Following the
close of the public review period, the lead agency typically prepares a Final EIR, which includes
the comments received during the review period (either verbatim or in summary), and responses
to the significant environmental issues raised in those comments. Prior to taking action on a
proposed project, the lead agency must certify the EIR and make certain findings.

A lead agency, however, is required to recirculate a Draft EIR, prior to certification, when
"significant new information" is added to the EIR after the public review period begins (CEQA
Guidelines Section 15088.5). "New information added to an EIR is not `significant' unless the
EIR is changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a
substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such
an effect (including a feasible project alternative) that the project's proponents have declined to
implement. `Significant new information' requiring recirculation includes, for example, a
disclosure showing that:

     1. A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or from a new
        mitigation measure proposed to be implemented.
     2. A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result unless
        mitigation measures are adopted that reduce the impact to a level of insignificance.
     3. A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different from others
        previously analyzed would clearly lessen the environmental impacts of the project, but
        the project's proponents decline to adopt it.

Recirculated Draft EIR                                                                     October 2012

R1. Introduction




     4. The draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature
        that meaningful public review and comment were precluded. (Mountain Lion Coalition v.
        Fish and Game Com. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043)" (CEQA Guidelines, Section
        15088.5[a].)

Public notice and circulation of a Recirculated Draft EIR is required, per CEQA Guidelines
Sections 15086 and 15087. Recirculation may be limited to those chapters or portions of the EIR
that have been modified.

On the other hand, "[r]ecirculation is not required where the new information added to the EIR
merely clarifies or amplifies or makes insignificant modifications in an adequate EIR." (Id., subd. [b]).
In fact, "the Legislature did not intend to promote endless rounds of revision and recirculation of
EIR's. Recirculation was intended to be an exception, rather than the general rule." (Laurel Heights
Improvement Assn. v. Regents of the University of California (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1132.)

In some instances, lead agencies, voluntarily conduct a full or partial recirculation of a draft EIR
not because such recirculation is legally required but because the agencies find it desirable to subject
new or expanded analysis to formal public review and scrutiny with the goal of fostering fully
informed decision making. Here, such is partly the case. This Recirculated Draft EIR addresses
a number of issues for which recirculation is not necessary under the legal standards set forth
above. One issue addressed in this document, however, does trigger recirculation under Section
15088.5 of the CEQA Guidelines: increasing the amount of material processed at the Central Site
Alternative from 110,000 tons per year to 200,000 tons per year. This change could result in a
substantial increase in the severity of environmental impacts such as air quality emissions, traffic
and hydrology and water quality. To assure that all the resource areas are appropriately analyzed,
all the resource areas for the Central Site Alternative (Chapter 24 through 32) are reviewed in this
Recirculated Draft EIR for impacts related to the increased capacity and operational changes.

As to the increase throughput, recirculation of the entire draft EIR is not required. Rather, a
partial recirculation is authorized by the CEQA Guidelines:

           When the EIR is revised only in part and the lead agency is recirculating only the
           revised chapters or portions of the EIR, the lead agency may request that
           reviewers limit their comments to the revised chapters or portions of the
           recirculated EIR. The lead agency need only respond to (i) comments received
           during the initial circulation period that relate to chapters or portions of the
           document that were not revised and recirculated, and (ii) comments received
           during the recirculation period that relate to the chapters or portions of the
           earlier EIR that were revised and recirculated. The lead agency's request that
           reviewers limit the scope of their comments shall be included either within the
           text of the revised EIR or by an attachment to the revised EIR. (CEQA
           Guidelines, Section 15088.5[f][2])

In preparing this document, the Sonoma County Waste Management Agency (SCWMA) is
availing itself of the option described immediately above. Readers are thus directed to comment

only on the new information found herein. The SCWMA will not treat as timely, and will not
respond in writing, to any comments addressing issues that are not addressed herein but rather
were previously addressed in the original Draft EIR published in December 2011. That Draft EIR
is referred throughout this document as the "2011 Draft EIR". The Final EIR, as eventually
prepared, will contain the SCWMA's written responses to all significant environmental issues
raised in comments on the 2011 Draft EIR (generally on all sites except the Central Site Alternative)
and responses to appropriately focused comments on the Recirculated Draft EIR (i.e., this document).


Project History

Notice of Availability and Draft EIR
A Notice of Availability of a Draft EIR and Public Hearing was issued by SCWMA for the
SCWMA Compost Facility on December 21, 2011 and revised on January 20, 2012 to extend the
comment period. The Draft EIR (State Clearinghouse # 2008122007) was circulated for public
comment from December 21, 2011 through February 21, 2012.


Changes to the Central Site Alternative
The primary reason for soliciting comments on a Draft EIR is to allow the lead agency (e.g., Sonoma
County) to identify, at the earliest possible time, the potentially significant adverse effects of a
proposed project and alternatives and the mitigation measures that would substantially lessen or
avoid these effects. Comments on the SCWMA 2011 Draft EIR were extensive and included the
results of engineering and processing reviews of the potential capacity at the Central Site Alternative.
In the 2011 Draft EIR, the Central Site Alternative was analyzed to only have the capacity to process
approximately 110,000 tons of incoming feedstock materials per year. However, after additional
review of the site design and other aerated static pile (ASP) composting processes (e.g., covered
aerated static piles), one comment letter indicated that 200,000 tons per year could be processed
at the Central Site Alternative. 1 This goal would be reached by using cutting edge technologies
such as the use of cement push walls, special covers, positive air pressure, and oxygen and temperature
gauges connected to a computer system that manage the air pressure and allow for additional tons
of materials to be composted on less space than with traditional windrow or other ASP composting
processes. For purposes of reviewing potential impacts of the proposed approach (to achieve a
throughput of 200,000 tons per year), this Recirculated Draft EIR will analyze the approach
identified in the comment letter.2

Based on this engineering review and other written and oral comments, the following changes
were made to the Central Site Alternative.


1 It should be noted that the proposed design moved the administrative and maintenance building off the processing site
   to allow for more capacity. Such actions were not considered in the conceptual design for the Central Disposal Site
   Alternative, but could realistically be implemented in determining a final design for the Central Disposal Site
   Alternative.

R1. Introduction




      Using the existing single-story administrative and maintenance building3
      Creating a single level processing site in one phase rather than a three tiered site in two
      phases
      Redesigning the ASP site layout
      Cutting approximately 421,000 cubic yards of soil and filling with approximately

      306,000 cubic yards of soil 

      Increasing the incoming compost feedstock from 110,000 tons per year to 200,000 tons
      per year
      Changing the maximum pile height from 12 feet to 14 feet

To the extent these changes affect potentially significant impacts, they are addressed in the
recirculated portions of the Draft EIR.

It is also assumed that construction would start in 2013. However, for purposes of comparison to
the project and other alternatives considered in the 2011 Draft EIR, the analysis presented in this
Recirculated Draft EIR, including air quality and traffic analyses, presume that construction
would be initiated in 2011. This enables the direct comparison of potential impacts associated
with the Central Site Alternative to the proposed project and other alternatives, as previously
evaluated.


CEQA EIR Process

Lead Agency
As the CEQA lead agency, SCWMA is responsible for the preparation and certification of the
EIR prior to approving or carrying out the proposed project. In its role as the lead agency,
SCWMA has directed the partial recirculation of the 2011 Draft EIR for the SCWMA Compost
Facility.


Notice of Recirculation
Recirculation of a Draft EIR requires the notification of responsible and trustee agencies and the
public, per CEQA Guidelines Sections 15086 and 15087. As explained earlier in this chapter, the
lead agency need only recirculate those chapters or portions of the Draft EIR that have been modified.
The modified chapters of the Draft EIR are identified and summarized in Chapter R2, Summary.
The impact conclusions and resultant mitigation measures for all other resource chapters and
alternative sites contained in the 2011 Draft EIR remain the same and are not discussed further in
this Recirculated Draft EIR.




3 The current administrative and maintenance building used for the existing compost facility would also be used for the
    proposed compost facility. This building is currently located at the entrance of the existing compost facility.

The SCWMA will also hold a public hearing on Wednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:00 a.m. in
the Ray Miller Community Center ­ Cotati Room, 216 East School Street, Cotati, CA
94931. This hearing will allow public comment on the DEIR for the proposed compost facility
project. Comments received during the comment period, including the public hearing, will be
considered by the SCWMA during the preparation of the Final EIR.


Final EIR and EIR Certification
As limited to the topics of the recirculation, the SCWMA will respond in writing to significant
environmental points raised by the reviewers of the Recirculated Draft EIR in their comments.
The comments and responses will be included in the Final EIR. The Final EIR shall consist of
the Draft EIR, the Recirculated Draft EIR, comments received on both the Draft EIR and
Recirculated Draft EIR, and the responses to those comments. After a public hearing on the
project, the lead agency decision-making body (i.e., the SCWMA) will then review the Final EIR
and any public testimony and decide whether to certify the Final EIR and whether to approve or
deny the project.

If the SCWMA approves the project and significant impacts identified by the EIR cannot be
mitigated, the SCWMA must state in writing the reasons for its actions. A statement of
overriding considerations must be included in the record of the project approval and mentioned in
the notice of determination (CEQA Guidelines, Section 15093(c)).

Summary

As more fully described in Chapter R1, Introduction, the lead agency need only recirculate those
chapters or portions of the 2011 Draft EIR that have been modified. For this project,
consideration of the revised Central Site Alternative and issues raised in the comments on the
December 2011 Draft EIR have resulted in the SCWMA's desire to clarify chapters or sections of
chapters of the 2011 Draft EIR. This modified text is included in the following sections:

           Table 2-3, Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures (Recirculated Chapters Only)
           Section 4.7, Central Site Alternative Project Description
           Chapter 24, Air Quality/Central Site Alternative
           Chapter 25, Biological Resources/Central Site Alternative
           Chapter 26, Cultural Resources/Central Site Alternative
           Chapter 27, Hydrology and Water Quality/Central Site Alternative

           Chapter 31, Traffic/Central Site Alternative
           Chapter 32, Aesthetics/Central Site Alternative


Format of Changes
For each chapter, the key revisions or updates for each chapter are marked to help the reader
identify specific portions of the chapters that have been modified. As shown in the example
below, new text is underlined and deleted text has strikethrough marking.


  This sentence is underlined as an example of new text. This sentence is striken as an example
  of a sentence or word that has been removed.



The impact conclusions and resultant mitigation measures for all other resource chapters and
alternative sites contained in the original 2011 Draft EIR remain the same and are not discussed
further in this Partial Recirculated Draft EIR.

R2. Summary




Mitigation Measures
Some of the mitigation measures for the Central Site Alternative are the same as mitigation
measures for Site 5A and 40 so the mitigation measure is not repeated but referenced to the
original measure first introduced in the 2011 DEIR (e.g., Implement Mitigation Measure 7.3).
Therefore, for convenience to those referenced (or "repeated") measures, the Summary Table of
the Impacts for Sites 5A and 40 is provided in this Recirculated Draft EIR as Appendix 2011
DEIR Mitigation Measures.


Summary of Changes
Section 4.7, Central Site Alternative Project Description

The description of the Central Site Alternative has been revised to describe the changes identified
in Chapter R1, which are primarily related to increased throughput of compost materials.

The original Central Site Alternative description used in the Draft EIR included the processing of
110,000 tons per year using aerated static piles (ASP) on a three tiered site. Processing of the material
is similar to the processes described in Chapter 4.7, Central Site Alternative of the 2011 Draft EIR.

Additional information pertaining to the ongoing Central Site Landfill water quality monitoring
and operations has been added to the section. Updated throughput and percent composition of
yard and wood waste processed through the existing compost facility was also included.

The Central Site Alternative composting site layout and conceptual design has been revised,
which is reflected in updated figures. Soil cut and fill estimates for leveling the site have also
been updated accordingly. Additional information is provided regarding the proposed covered,
positive-pressure technology that would allow for larger mass to be composted on less space,
which allows for the increased throughput capacity to 200,000 tons per year.

Composting feedstock limitations are also discussed, per State Water Resources Control Board
(SWRCB) recommendations for composting operations statewide.

Finally, options for stormwater and compost leachate management have been revised.
Compliance with the County's MS4 permit for stormwater was also added.

Chapter 24, Air Quality/ Central Site Alternative

The analyses included in Chapter 24 have been revised to incorporate changes to construction and
operational assumptions for the Central Site Alternative. In regards to construction, Impact 24.1
(criteria pollutant emissions), Impact 24.5 (toxic air contaminants [TACs]), and Impact 24.6
(greenhouse gases [GHGs]) have been revised to reflect the changes in construction phasing,
disturbed area, and conservative soil haulage. For operations, Impact 24.2 (criteria pollutant
emissions), Impact 24.5 (TACs), and Impact 24.6 (GHGs) have been revised to reflect the

changes to the assumed throughput, traffic, project buildout year, and ASP control of GHGs.
Finally, Impact 24.4 (odors) has been updated to incorporate odor complaint information from the
Sonoma County Environmental Health and Safety Section pertaining to the existing facility, as
well as a discussion of potential changes to odor generation for the Central Site Alternative.

Chapter 25, Biological Resources/ Central Site Alternative

This chapter has been revised to incorporate additional information pertaining to the California
tiger salamander (CTS). In addition, Mitigation Measure 25.1 has been updated to clarify the
mitigation process for the California Red-legged Frog (CRLF).

Chapter 26, Cultural Resources/ Central Site Alternative

No changes were made to the impact analyses or mitigations in Chapter 26.

Chapter 27, Hydrology and Water Quality/ Central Site Alternative

This chapter has been revised to incorporate information pertaining to ongoing Central Site Landfill
groundwater level and ground and surface water quality monitoring information. Also, additional
detail is provided regarding water quality permitting requirements. Impact 27.1 (violate water quality
standard, waste discharge requirement, or substantially degrade water quality) has been revised to
include permitting information as well as the new Mitigation Measure 27.1b, which describes
measures to ensure that construction related blasting does not result in the degradation of groundwater.
Impact 27.3 (alter the existing drainage pattern) has been revised to include greater detail for
Mitigation Measure 27.3, which requires a grading and drainage plan be prepared prior to construction.
Finally, Impact 27.4 (stormwater runoff) has been updated with a revised stormwater discharge
management analysis, including MS4 permit requirements, as well as updated Mitigation Measure
27.4a (grading and drainage plan) and a new Mitigation Measure 27.4b, which describes stormwater
management options.

Chapter 28, Land Use and Agriculture/ Central Site Alternative

Impact 28.2 (Central Site Alternative could conflict with the Sonoma County General Plan or
Zoning Ordinance) has been revised to include Mitigation Measure 28.2 as a significant and
unavoidable determination, since noise levels could occasionally exceed the standards in the
General Plan.

Chapter 29, Noise/ Central Site Alternative

Impact 29.2 (operational noise) has been updated with potential equipment hours and notes that
although ASP fans may operate 24 hours per day, positive pressure systems (push fans) can be
very intermittent with long off cycles. Also, since loaders would be used rather than dozers
during operations, the noise analysis has been updated accordingly. The County noise standards
of L25, L8, and L2 are also described. Mitigation Measures 29.2d and 29.2e were also added,
which work to keep the noisiest equipment away from the nearest residence and require the

applicant to fund sound insulation upgrades to the nearest residence (if resident is amenable),
respectively. Impact 29.3 (traffic noise) has been revised to reflect increased traffic volumes. This
impact has also been updated with a description of the number of homes that the County has already
retrofitted for sound insulation, as well as road segments that the County has already developed
sound walls/fences, in order to minimize roadway noise. Finally, Impact 29.4 (blasting) has been
revised to include several additional mitigation measures (Measures 29.4h and 29.4i), as well as
allowable hours for blasting activities that are consistent with the Central Disposal Landfill hourly
restrictions (Mitigation Measure 29.4c).

Chapter 30, Public Services and Utilities/ Central Site Alternative

Impact 30.2 (energy demands) has been revised with updated electricity and fuel usage assumptions
based on the increased throughput and associated equipment and vehicle operations. In addition,
Impact 30.5 (stormwater facilities) has been updated with information regarding optional stormwater
management facility construction, added Mitigation Measure 30.5, and determined that the impact
would be less-than-significant after mitigation. Finally, Impact 30.6 (wastewater treatment facilities)
has been added to the chapter and includes a discussion of the optional conveyance of stormwater
to the Laguna Wastewater Treatment Plant, which has sufficient capacity to support the Central
Site Alternative. Impact 30.6 was determined to be a less-than-significant impact without mitigation.

Chapter 31, Traffic/ Central Site Alternative

This chapter has been revised to reflect increased traffic volumes based on the increase in material
throughput to 200,000 tons per year for the Central Site Alternative. Impact 31.5 (long-term
cumulative traffic volumes) identified a significant impact to traffic delays at the Gravenstein
Highway (SR 116) / Stony Point Road intersection. Mitigation Measure 31.5 would reduce the
impact to less than significant. However, if implementation of Mitigation Measure 31.5 is not
approved by Caltrans (the jurisdiction responsible for SR 116), the impact would be Significant
and Unavoidable. Additional analysis was also included in Impact 31.8 (degradation of pavement
on public roads) and Impact 31.9 (construction traffic).

Chapter 32, Aesthetics/ Central Site Alternative

Additional details were incorporated into Mitigation Measure 32.1 pertaining to the screening
measures to screen views of composting facilities from Roblar Road.

  Table 4-2 shows the ability of each alternative to achieve the project objectives. As shown by the
  table, the No Project A and B Alternatives fail to meet the majority of the project objectives. The
  Site 40, Site 13, Central Site, and Limited Public Access Alternatives meet all of the project
  objectives. The Central Site Alternative meets project objectives 1 and 3, but fails to meet project
  objective 2 because of its limited capacity. The three objectives of the project are listed below:

4.10 Environmentally Superior Alternative
Site 40, and Site 13, and the Central Site Alternative each meet the three project objectives (as depicted
in Table 4-2). Site 40, and Site 13, and the Central Site Alternative have specific impacts that would
be greater than the project (as shown in Table 4-1). Site 40 would require substantial grading
during construction and would result in greater TAC health risk during operations. Site 13 would also
result in potentially greater air quality impacts; however, the primary drawback for this alternative
is that the traffic safety issues would be greatly increased compared to the proposed project at Site
5A. Importantly, the Site 40 Alternative would avoid any impacts to the 100-year flood plain. The
Site 40 Alternative also would avoid the need for safety improvements on Lakeville Road that
would be required for the development of the proposed project at Site 5A. In contrast, the safety
improvements for Highway 37 required for development of Site 13 would potentially be more
expensive and less feasible than the safety improvements needed on Lakeville Road for Site 5A.

The Central Site Alternative has the potential to result in noise effects to the Gray property that
would be greater than the project (Site 5A). However, the operational impacts to air quality, noise,
aesthetics, hydrology, land use, and traffic would be similar in location and character (although
the magnitude would vary [and potentially increase for some resources] from the existing baseline)
to impacts that currently occur at the existing County composting facility at the Central Disposal
Site. Operations at Site 40 and and Site 13 would not be similar to any existing operations at those
locations.

Given these considerationscerns the Central Site Site 40 Alternative is the environmentally
preferred alternative to the project.


4.11 Other Site Challenges/Difficulties/Infeasibilities
Challenges related to development of a compost facility meeting the County objectives and other
financial considerations at the various sites include the following:

Site 5A:

      The cost of roadway improvements to Lakeville Road and to private Twin House Ranch
      Road has been estimated at $3.7 million. The cost of these roadway improvements are
      significantly higher than the estimated costs ($1.5 -$2 million) for purchasing the project
      site. This substantial cost exists for this project but not the other project-level
      alternatives. (likely financially infeasible)
      Would require general plan amendment, zoning change, dealing with Williamson Act
      contract.
      The site would be inconsistent with the County of Sonoma's policies on net fill in a
      floodplain. (likely procedurally infeasible)
      The County of Sonoma discourages the development of on-site wastewater systems in
      locations such as Site 5A. (likely procedurally infeasible)
Site 13:

      The same issues as Site 5a, only roadway improvements on Highway 37 would likely be
      more expensive.
Central Disposal Site:

      The 110,000 tons per year (tpy) capacity would be only about half of the 200,000 tpy
      goal for the facility.
      The length of time for full buildout (and limited operational area in Phase I) would limit
      the materials that could be composed at this site.SCWMA will need to develop a long-
      term mechanism to lease the composting site area from the County of Sonoma and would
      need to ensure that operations don't interfere with other priority waste management
      actions at the Central Disposal Site.
Site 40:

      Would require general plan amendment, zoning change, dealing with Williamson Act
      contract.
      An Aerated Static Pile (ASP) composting system would be required to mitigate potential
      air quality impacts. Windrow composting would probably not be acceptable.

Project Description for Central Site Alternative
(Recirculated Chapter 4.7)

Overview
The Central Site Alternative proposes the construction of a new compost facility on a portion of the
Central Disposal Site rather than the project site (Site 5A). The Central Site Alternative would
include a compost facility with a pad area of approximately 22 acres that require initial grading
and disturbance of approximately 34 acres on the 400-acre Central Disposal Site property, located
approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the City of Cotati, off of Mecham Road as shown in Figure
4.8. An aerial photograph of the Central Disposal Site and the immediate vicinity is shown in
Figure 4.9 (Revised). As with the proposed project (Site 5A), the Central Site Alternative would
replace the existing compost facility at the Central Disposal Site and would have the capacity to
process approximately 200,000 but would only have the capacity to process approximately 110,000
tons of incoming feedstock materials per year. Processing would include green material, food
material, and agricultural materials. Because of limited space, this compost facility would use
aerated static pile (ASP) technology. Under this alternative, no development is proposed on
the project site (Site 5A).

Objectives
The Central Site Alternative would meet all but one of the primary project objectives discussed:
above in Section 4.2.

Objective 1.             Relocate Sonoma County Waste Management Agency's (SCWMA) composting
                         operations from its current location at the County's Central Disposal Site

Objective 2.             Establish a permanent composting facility in Sonoma County with sufficient
                         capacity for current and future quantities.

Objective 3.             Provide a facility to assist jurisdictions within SCWMA's service area in meeting
                         the goals and objectives for waste diversion as set forth in the California
                         Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939).

With respect to Objective 1, while the Central Site Alternative would keep the SCWMA's composting
operations on the County's Central Disposal Site, the operations would be located in an area of the
County's Central Disposal Site that was not previously used as a landfill.

R4. Project Description for Central Site Alternative




While it would keep the SCWMA's composting operations on the County's Central Disposal Site,
the operations would be located in an area that was not previously used as a landfill. Additionally, this
alternative would only be able to process 110,000 tons of material after completion of Phase 2,
which could mean that there would not be enough space to compost the projected 200,000 tons
anticipated by 2030.

Central Site Alternative and Vicinity
The Central Site Alternative would be at the Central Disposal Site (Assessor's Parcel Number
024-080-019)., which includes approximately 400 acres in Sonoma County. The Central Site is
located approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the City of Cotati, off of Mecham Road, as shown on
Figure 4-8. An aerial photograph of the Central Site and the immediate vicinity is shown on
Figure 4-9. The overall footprint size of this alternative would be approximately 37.5 acres and the
composting area would occupy approximately 25 acres in the northwestern corner of the Central
Disposal Site as shown on Figure 4-9. Locations for composting at the Central Disposal Site
were not evaluated in the siting study prepared for SCWMA (HDR Engineering, Inc., 2008) because
of the landfill divestiture in process at that time. The SCWMA decided to include analysis of the
Central Disposal Site to this EIR February 17, 2010.

The Central Disposal Ssite is owned by Sonoma County and currently used for the existing compost
facility as well as recycling and landfill operations. The site was historically used as a landfill.
Buildings associated with the recycle/reuse facility and household hazardous waste facility are
currently located on the eastern portion of the site and wouldmay remain in operation under this
alternative. The current composting facility is located in the northern portion of the Central
Disposal Site and detention ponds collecting site runoff are located along the southern portion of
the Central Disposal Site. Access to the site is off of Mecham Road. Regional access from major
population centers in Sonoma County is provided by U.S. Highway 101.

The majority of land uses surrounding the Central Disposal Site are agricultural in nature with areas
of open space. Single-family rural residences are scattered in the surrounding area and often present
on sites with agricultural operations, such as dairy farming and grazing. The closest residence to
the Central Site Alternative composting area is approximately 500 feet northeast. Other residences
are approximately 1,000 feet to the south, 4,500 feet to the east (Happy Acres subdivision), and
5,000 feet to the southeast. Dunham Charter School is located approximately 4,000 feet north of
the Central Site Alternative composting area. Urban development associated with the City of
Cotati is located approximately 2.5 miles northeast of the Central Disposal Site. The Petaluma
Municipal Airport is located approximately 8.5 miles southeast of the Central Disposal Site.


Central Disposal Site (Existing Landfill)
The Central Disposal Site is owned by Sonoma County and is a landfill site, which also includes
recycling operations, including recycling/reuse and household hazardous waste disposal facilities in
the eastern portion of the site, and an existing compost facility in the northern portion of the site.

In May, 2003, the County confirmed detection of trace amounts of volatile organic carbons (VOCs)
in the underdrain beneath a lined portion of the landfill. The contamination source was traced to a
design flaw in the liner anchor trench, which allowed landfill gas to migrate around the liner and
into groundwater, as well cause physical damage to the liner. A retrofit for the liner was completed,
along with other upgrades at the landfill site. However, in response to updated Waste Discharge
Requirements from the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (NCRWQCB), the
County began transporting all waste out of county for disposal at several landfills with available
capacity. During 2004 to 2010, operations on the site included recycling and composting operations,
transfer operations, and household hazardous waste disposal (Sonoma County, 2012).

By 2010, the County had achieved resolution of outstanding corrective action Waste Discharge
Requirements (WDRs) issued by the NCRWQCB sufficiently to enable continued use of the landfill
facility. Since September 2010, an average of 450 tons/day of waste has been landfilled on-site,
and the County is the owner and operator of record for the facility. As of September, 2010, available
capacity at the landfill was approximately 9.1 million cubic yards, sufficient to support landfilling
for approximately 15 to 20 years. Additional areas of the landfill site are currently undergoing
development in support of ongoing operations on-site. These changes were evaluated under the
1998 EIR for the Central Disposal Site Improvement Program EIR and associated documentation
(Sonoma County, 2012).

The landfill stormwater and leachate management system for the Central Disposal Site includes
several ponds for collecting leachate and site runoff that are located along the southern portion, as
well as the northeastern and northwestern areas of the Central Disposal Site. These ponds include
a series of detention ponds that are used for storm water retention and sedimentation. There are
also two leachate ponds that operate separately from the stormwater ponds and independently of
one another. Thus, stormwater and leachate from the landfill are managed separately, and are not
commingled.

The County maintains an extensive groundwater monitoring well network at the Central Disposal
Site. Data from this monitoring network are incorporated into the Recirculated Draft EIR. Additional
discussion of the existing groundwater monitoring network and associated groundwater monitoring
data are contained in Chapter 27, Hydrology and Water Quality/Central Site Alternative.


Existing Compost Facility
Under existing conditions, the Sonoma Compost Company operates an approximately 35-acre
facility that is located at the existing Central Site Landfill, within the northern-central area of the
landfill, immediately east of the proposed composting facility site. As of 2011, the facility processed a
total of 98,461 tons of feedstock per year, of which 95% (93,179 tons) was yard waste and 5%
(5,282 tons) was wood waste (SCWMA, 2012). For additional discussion regarding the existing
facility, please refer to Chapter 3, Section 3.3 of the 2011 Draft EIR.

R4. Project Description for Central Site Alternative




Central Site Alternative Characteristics
Composting Site Layout
The Central Site Alternative would only include the ASP processing option due to limited space.
An aerial photograph of the Central Disposal Site and its immediate vicinity is shown on Figure
4-9 (Revised). Figure 4-10 (Revised) is a plan view of the preliminary conceptual design. The
overall footprint size of this alternative would be installed on approximately 22 acres (total pad
area); the overall area that may need to be graded to allow for development of the site would be
approximate 34-acres. The active composting area would occupy approximately 11 acres in the
northwestern corner of the Central Disposal Site as shown on Figure 4-10 (Revised). Locations
for composting at the Central Disposal Site were not evaluated in the siting study prepared for
SCWMA (HDR Engineering, Inc., 2008) because the landfill divestiture process was underway at
that time. The future dry fermentation biogas plant on Figure 4-10 (Revised) is not proposed at
this time nor evaluated in this EIR.

Proposed facilities and site layout of the Central Site Alternative were discussed in Chapters 3 and 4
of the 2011 Draft EIR. The proposed facilities and site layout would be similar to those described
therein, except that the proposed facilities would be sufficient to handle up to 200,000 tons per
year of incoming feedstock material. Key features of the proposed composting site include an
active composting area, underlain by an asphalt pad, as well as compost curing areas, product
storage and sales areas, areas for food feedstock pre-processing/material sorting, a chipping/
grinding/maintenance area, an arriving/departing circulation area with a truck scale, and a
stormwater detention pond. For additional discussion regarding proposed facilities, refer to
Chapters 3 and 4 of the 2011 Draft EIR.

Leveling the proposed composting facility area would require cutting approximately 421,000
cubic yards of soil and filling with approximately 306,000 cubic yards of soil. This would result
in a net excess of 115,000 cubic yards of soil, which would be utilized at the adjacent landfill site
for ongoing operations, and/or stored for future use at the landfill. Leveling and site preparation is
anticipated to require blasting in order to loosen rocky materials on site and allow for grading and
facility installation.

As noted in the 2011 Draft EIR, the site footprint for the Central Site Alternative is smaller than
the other alternatives considered for this project. As a result, an administrative and maintenance
building would be located off of the proposed compost site. The current administrative and
maintenance building used for the existing compost facility would be used for the proposed compost
facility. This building is currently located at the entrance of the existing compost facility. No
additions or alterations need be made to that building and therefore use of that building would not
cause any new environmental impacts. The existing and proposed area for this facility is shown
as the separate polygon to the southeast of the main composting site.

Composting Process
Due to limited space, the Central Site Alternative would only include the ASP processing options,
and does not consider a windrow composting option. A description of operations associated with
the ASP option is included in the 2011 Draft EIR Chapter 3, Project Description, Section 3.5.
ASP operations include covered compost piles that are mechanically aerated either by a blower
that pushes or a pump that pulls air through the piles. Typically ASP systems are not turned as
frequently as a windrow system. The Central Site Alternative option proposes to use a positive
pressure ASP system, which uses a membrane covered aerated static pile design. Membranes
would be placed on the piles using an approximately 17 to 18-foot tall rigging system, which
would carry the rolled membrane over the top of each pile, unrolling the membrane as it travels
along the length of the pile. Following covering with the membrane, air would be pushed through
the static piles by a blower mechanism. The membrane cover would act as a physical barrier
against dust and bacteria and would provide odor and air emission control similar to a
biofilter. The blowers are controlled by a computer system that monitors oxygen and temperature.
Aeration trenches would be included under each pile, and would also serve as ducts to
collect leachate. Leachate management is discussed below. Cement push walls around the
pile would be used to contain the piles as well as house the control equipment. Use of these
technologies allows for a larger mass of material to be composted on less space, as compared to a
conventional ASP composting process. The 2011 Draft EIR includes information on covered ASP
systems in Appendices ASP-2 that are in use at Cedar Grove Organics. Also Appendix ASP-2
provides additional information on GoreTM covered ASP membranes and systems.

Composting Feedstocks and Feedstock Limitations
Proposed composting feedstocks were discussed in the 2011 Draft EIR, and included the following
general feedstock categories: green material (yard waste), food material, and agricultural materials.
Subsequent to circulation of the 2011 Draft EIR, additional constraints have been added to the
project, with respect to limitations on potential composting feedstocks.

The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) has proposed certain limitations on composting
feedstocks, in order to prevent detrimental degradation of water quality as a result of leaching of
water quality pollutants from compost product material. Based on the recommendations provided
in the SWRCB's Draft Concepts for a Proposed Statewide Order for Composting Facilities, the
following wastes would be prohibited from use as composting feedstock during project operations:

      Hazardous wastes (consistent with CCR Title 14, Section 17855.2(c))
      Ash with contaminants of heavy metals
      Wood with contaminants of heavy metals and other preservatives
      Petroleum wastes
      Medical wastes (consistent with CCR Title 14, section 17855.2(b))
      Mammalian tissue, except when from the food service industry, grocery stores, or
      residential food scrap collection, or as part of a research composting activity (consistent
      with CCR Title 14, Section 17855.2(a)

Stormwater Management
Stormwater at the Central Site Alternative would be managed in a manner similar to that described
for the proposed project in the 2011 Draft EIR. The site would be graded and designed such that
all on-site drainage would be directed into a proposed retention pond on-site. Compost leachate
from composting operations would be collected at the individual ASPs and then reused on-site.
In the event there are insufficient on-site reuse options, the leachate may be conveyed to the
proposed retention pond on-site. The retention pond would be sized with sufficient capacity to
fully contain all anticipated stormwater flows during an average rainfall year, and up to a 24-hour,
25 year storm event. In order to fully contain these anticipated stormwater flows, a retention pond
with a total capacity of approximately 8.3 AF of storage capacity would be required. The proposed
Central Site Alternative would include installation of a 14.4 AF capacity retention pond on site. This
volume of storage capacity is anticipated to be sufficient to contain a 24 hour, 25-year storm, even
if the retention pond already contains up to about 6 AF of water prior to initiation of the storm
event. For additional discussion of anticipated stormwater management procedures, refer to Section
27, Central Site Hydrology and Water Quality.

Composting operations would be managed so as to minimize potential for discharges from the
site. However, discharges associated with storm events that are larger than a 24 hour, 25-year
storm event, or from smaller events during an above average rainfall year if the retention pond is
nearing capacity, could result in the discharge of stormwater from the composting facility site.
Discharges from the site would be handled according to one or more of the following options:

Option 1: Discharge of Stormwater to Gossage/Stemple Creek
Gossage Creek flows in a southwesterly direction along the northwestern edge of the proposed
compost site. The creek discharges into Stemple Creek, which eventually discharges into the
Estero de San Antonio, and the Pacific Ocean. Alternatively, discharges could occur via unnamed
drainages that flow directly to Stemple Creek. Discharges to the creek would require acquisition
of appropriate permitting, as discussed in additional detail in Chapter 27, Central Site Hydrology
and Water Quality.

Option 2: Discharge of Stormwater to the Laguna Wastewater Treatment Plant
via the Central Site Landfill
Under this option, when sufficient capacity is not available in the proposed retention pond, stormwater
would be directed to the leachate containment ponds at the adjacent Central Site Landfill. Under
existing conditions, when the leachate containment ponds reach capacity, additional flows are
conveyed, via pipeline, to the Laguna Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), located approximately
4.5 miles north of the composting site.

The Laguna WWTP is located near the intersection of Llano Road and Meadow Lane, to the
southwest of the City of Santa Rosa, immediately north and east of the Laguna de Santa Rosa.
The plant treats wastewater generated in the Cities of Santa Rosa, Cotati, Sebastopol, and the
unincorporated community served by the South Park Sanitation District.

The Laguna WWTP maintains an average dry weather capacity of 21.34 million gallons per day
(mgd), with summer dry weather flows averaging approximately 15.5 to 17 mgd. Winter wet
weather flows can increase substantially, with flows during large storm events exceeding 50 mgd
for short periods. As of the time of publication of this document, the Laguna WWTP had a monthly
average wet weather capacity not to exceed 47.7 mgd, and a weekly average capacity not to exceed
64 mgd. Plant treatment facilities include primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment with ultraviolet
disinfection, including three UV disinfection channels. Tertiary treated wastewater from the facility
is used, in accordance with applicable regulations, for urban reuse/recycled water, in support of
created wetlands, in support of approximately 6,000 acres of agriculture, as a water supply for
the Geysers Recharge Project (to support geothermal power production), and as discharge to
the Russian River by way of the Laguna de Santa Rosa at a rate of up to five percent of the river's
flow. The plant is required to provide a tertiary level of treatment to all incoming flows, including
during wet periods. Implementation of this Option would require coordination with and approval
from the County and the Laguna WWTP. For a discussion of facility capacity and additional
stormwater management detail, please refer to Chapter 27, Central Site Hydrology and Water Quality.

Compost Leachate Management
Compost leachate is the liquid that percolates to the bottom of the compost piles. Because the
proposed design includes covered aerated static piles, the amount of moisture in the piles can be
better controlled than for uncovered windrows. Leachate would be contained and collected from
drains located below the aerated static piles. During operations, collected leachate would be reused
so that it would not be added to the stormwater in the retention pond or otherwise be discharged.

Permits and Approvals
The Central Site Alternative would be subject, as appropriate to the site specific conditions and
proposed operations, to similar entitlements, permits, and approvals described in 2011 SCWMA
Draft EIR Chapter 3, Project Description, Section 3.6 (2011 Draft EIR). In addition to the permits
listed in Section 3.6, the Central Site Alternative would need to comply with the County's MS4
permit for stormwater.

Environmental Analysis
The environmental impacts of the Central Site Alternative are analyzed in the Recirculated Draft EIR
in Chapters 24 through 32. In these chapters, the EIR preparers reviewed the potential impacts of
increasing site capacity to 200,000 tons per year. Several environmental issues were determined to be
less than significant for the project and were not analyzed further in this EIR for the proposed
project site (Site 5A) or other alternatives. As the Central Site Alternative was analyzed to an
equal level of analysis as the proposed project these issues are discussed briefly below.

R4. Project Description for Central Site Alternative




Geology and Soils
Based on the "Siting and Classification Study, Proposed Western Area Expansion" no faults on
the Central Site would be considered active (GeoLogic Associates, 2003). Design would follow
building codes and no impact would occur.


Hazards and Hazardous Materials
As with the project, the only hazardous materials associated with composting operations would
be required for the maintenance of the processing equipment, such as diesel fuel, lubricants, and
antifreeze. These materials would be controlled by following Best Management Practices. This
impact would be less than significant.


Mineral Resources
Sonoma County includes a Mining Resource (MR) combining district for the conservation and
protection of land that is necessary for future mineral resource production. The Central Site
Alternative is not located in an area with a zoning designation for mineral resources.


Population and Housing
As with the project, the Central Site Alternative would not create population growth as it would
simply relocate existing operations. Any road or infrastructure improvements are designed to
provide capacity for the project and are not designed with excess capacity. The project would not
displace existing housing.


Recreation
The establishment of composting operations at the Central Site Alternative would not increase
demands on recreational facilities nor would it include the construction of recreational facilities.

Air Quality/Central Site Alternative

24.1 Introduction
This chapter evaluates the potential impacts of the Central Site Alternative on regional and local air
quality from both stationary and mobile sources of air emissions. The information presented in this
chapter is unique to the Central Site Alternative and the reader is referred to Chapter 5, Air Quality
(2011 Draft EIR), in cases where air quality setting information and/or impact analysis is the same
for the Central Site as the project site.


24.2 Setting
Topography, Climate and Meteorology
Much of the information regarding general Climate and Meteorology is the same for the Central
Site as the project site. The reader is referred to Chapter 5, Air Quality (2011 Draft EIR), for this
information.


Regulatory Context
Information regarding the Regulatory Context for the Central Site is the same as for the project
site. The reader is referred to Chapter 5, Air Quality (2011 Draft EIR), for this information. Notably,
the current Bay Area Quality Management District (BAAQMD) CEQA Air Quality Guidelines
provide guidance for analyzing air emissions under CEQA, but do not recommend any specific
significance thresholds for construction and operational emission impacts. Instead, the current
BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines suggest that lead agencies either reference BAAQMD's
Thresholds of Significance adopted in 1999, or reference BAAQMD's CEQA Thresholds Options
and Justification Report developed by BAAQMD staff in 2009, in selecting a significance threshold
based on substantial evidence.1 The Sonoma County Waste Management Agency agrees that the
significance thresholds contained in BAAQMD staff's 2009 CEQA Thresholds Options and


1 The previous BAAQMD guidelines (adopted in June 2010 and amended in May 2011) did recommend specific significance
    thresholds. These guidelines were set aside pursuant to a judicial writ of mandate issued March 5, 2012, in California
    Building Industry Association v. BAAQMD (Alameda Superior Court Case No. RGI0548693). The judicial order
    requires BAAQMD to set aside its approval of the thresholds until it has conducted further environmental review
    under CEQA. The claims made in the case concerned the environmental impacts of adopting the thresholds ­ that
    is, how the thresholds would indirectly affect land use development patterns ­ not the scientific soundness of the
    BAAQMD's analysis of what levels of pollutants should be deemed significant, or the threshold to use in assessing
    any health risk impact a project will have on the existing environment.

24. Air Quality/Central Site Alternative




Justification Report are supported by substantial evidence and will use the significance thresholds
recommended there by the BAAQMD staff for determining the significance of air quality impacts
in this EIR.


Existing Air Quality
Existing levels of air quality in the Central Site area can generally be inferred from ambient air
quality measurements conducted by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)
at its nearby monitoring stations. The Central Site is approximately 16.5 miles northwest of the
project site, 10 miles southwest of the Santa Rosa monitoring station, and 26 miles northwest of
the San Rafael monitoring station. The Santa Rosa and San Rafael air quality monitoring station
data described in Chapter 5, Air Quality, for ozone and respirable particulates (PM10 and PM2.5)
would be representative of existing regional air quality at the Central Site as well. The reader is
referred to Chapter 5, Air Quality (2011 Draft EIR), for this information.


Sensitive Land Uses
Some persons are considered more sensitive than others to air pollutants. The reasons for heightened
sensitivity may include age, health problems, proximity to the emissions source, and duration of
exposure to air pollutants. Land uses such as schools, hospitals, and convalescent homes are
considered to be relatively sensitive to poor air quality because the very young, the old, and the
infirm are more susceptible to respiratory infections and other air-quality-related health problems
than the general public. Residential areas are considered sensitive to poor air quality because people
are often at home for extended periods. Recreational land uses are moderately sensitive to air
pollution, because vigorous exercise associated with recreation places a high demand on the human
respiratory system.

The Central Site is adjacent to the existing composting facility location (Sonoma Compost, Inc.).
Sensitive receptors would be similar to the current scenario. The nearest potential sensitive receptors
to the proposed Central Site composting area would be residences approximately 500 feet north,
1,000 feet to the south, 4,500 feet to the east (Happy Acres subdivision) and 5,000 feet to the
southeast. Dunham Elementary School is approximately 4,000 feet north of the site. Additionally,
residences along haul routes may also be considered sensitive receptors during construction and
operation of the Central Site Alternative.


24.3 Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Significance Criteria
The Significance Criteria for the air quality analysis for the Central Site is the same as for the
project site. The reader is referred to Chapter 5, Air Quality (2011 Draft EIR), for this
information.

Impact Discussion
Unlike the proposed project, composting for the Central Site Alternative would utilize only
aerated static piles (ASP). The air quality impacts of this option are described below. Note also
that the existing compost facility, located at the Central Site Landfill, utilizes an open windrow
system. In order to maintain consistency and direct comparability with the analyses for other
alternatives contained in the previously Circulated Draft EIR, 2011 was assumed to be the first
year of operation for the purposes of the air quality modeling and analysis.

Impact 24.1: Construction of the Central Site Alternative could generate short-term
emissions of criteria air pollutants: ROG, NOx, CO, PM10, and PM2.5 that could
contribute to existing nonattainment conditions and further degrade air quality. (Significant)
Construction of the Central Site Alternative would have similar impacts, regulations, and controls
as those described under Chapter 5, Air Quality, Impact 5.1 (2011 Draft EIR). BAAQMD has
adopted new daily mass significance thresholds for construction-related activities in its CEQA Air
Quality Guidelines. These thresholds are 54 pounds per day of ROG, NOx, or PM2.5 and 82
pounds per day for PM10. The URBEMIS2007 model was used to quantify construction emissions.
Unmitigated and mitigated construction-related emissions for the Central Site Alternative are
presented in Table 24-1 for Phase 1 (year 2010) and Phase 2 (year 2018) construction. As can be
seen from the data in Table 24-1, NOx emissions generated during Phase 1 construction would
exceed the BAAQMD threshold and would be significant without mitigation. Criteria pollutant
emissions generated during Phase 2 construction would not exceed the BAAQMD thresholds and
would be less than significant.

a. Emissions were modeled using URBEMIS2007 and assuming 25.5 acres of the total 10 approximate 34 acre-site (Phase 1) and 3.9
   acres of the total 15.6 acre-expansion (Phase 2) would be disturbed on the worse-case day. Default URBEMIS2007 equipment
   assumptions were assumed for construction. 150115,000 and 400,000 cubic yards of soil was conservatively assumed to be exported
   under Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively. Construction activities were assumed to occur for a duration of one year. Additional
   information is included in Appendix AIR-5 (Revised).
b. BAAQMD's proposed construction-related significance thresholds for PM10 and PM2.5 apply to exhaust emissions only and not to
   fugitive dust.
c. Mitigation measures were incorporated into the URBEMIS2007 model as surrogates for the Basic and Additional Control Measures
   described below under Mitigation Measure 24.1, per the BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines.

24. Air Quality/Central Site Alternative




Mitigation Measure

         Mitigation Measure 24.1: Implement the `Basic Control Measures' and `Additional Control
         Measures' specified in Mitigation Measure 5.1 (Construction Emission Controls) during
         Phase 1 construction, and implement only the `Basic Control Measures' (which are required
         for all construction projects in the BAAQMD jurisdiction) included in Mitigation Measure
         5.1 for Phase 2 construction (2011 Draft EIR).
         Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant.
         As depicted in Table 24-1, with mitigation implementation, NOx emissions during
         construction would be reduced below the BAAQMD threshold. This impact would be less
         than significant.



Impact 24.2: Operation of the Central Site Alternative would result in emissions of criteria
air pollutants at levels that would substantially contribute to a potential violation of
applicable air quality standards or to nonattainment conditions. (Less than Significant)

The Central Site Alternative-related air quality impacts fall into two categories: fugitive dust impacts
(re-entrainment on local roadways and on-site disturbed areas) and criteria pollutant impacts due
to off-road equipment, on-road vehicles (employee and haul truck trips), area sources (natural gas
combustion, landscaping equipment, architectural coatings), and composting off-gas emissions. The
modeling methodology and emission factors would be the same for the Central Site Alternative as
those described in Chapter 5, Air Quality, Impact 5.3 (2011 Draft EIR).

Conditions were assessed for the Existing Sonoma Compost facility (for year 2011), and for the
Central Site Alternative's assumed first year of operation (Phase 1, year 2011) and maximum
projected throughput (Phase 2, year 20192030). Table 24-2, below, presents estimated maximum
(worst-case) daily emissions of criteria pollutants, and comparison to the applicable regulatory
threshold. Table 24-2 shows that the estimated net emissions (Central Site minus Existing
emissions) of all pollutants would not exceed the applicable BAAQMD significance thresholds
during Phase 1 or Phase 2 operations. This would be a less than significant impact without
mitigation.

1. Emissions were modeled using several models and emission factors, including the URBEMIS2007 model (for off-road equipment, area
   sources, and fugitive dust from actively disturbed areas), EMFAC2007 for on-road vehicle exhaust, the CIWMB emission factor for VOC
   emissions (CIWMB, 2007) with a 95% reduction from ASP system (based on preliminary data), and U.S. EPA AP-42 (for paved roads
   (section 13.2.1 - Paved Roads)). Existing emissions of fugitive dust were assumed to be controlled by watering 2x per day and reducing
   speed on unpaved roads. These emission factors and modeling are described in more detail in Appendix AIR-5.
2. Values in (parentheses) represent a net reduction from the Existing scenario.
4. BAAQMD has established mass thresholds of significance for ROG, NOx, PM10, and PM2.5. The BAAQMD thresholds for CO are
   localized concentrations, which is described below under Impact 24.3.
5. Even though off-road equipment operations were assumed to increase over existing usage for the year 2019 2030 operations, NOx is
   estimated to substantially drop during that time due to assumed new equipment purchases or rebuilding the equipment in the year
   20162025, which would meet more stringent regulatory requirements.



Mitigation: None required.

24. Air Quality/Central Site Alternative




Impact 24.3: Central Site Alternative traffic would generate localized CO emissions on
roadways and at intersections in the site vicinity. (Less than Significant)

According to the BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines, a proposed project would result in a less-
than-significant impact to localized CO concentrations if the following screening criteria are met:

      1. Project is consistent with an applicable congestion management program established by
         the county congestion management agency for designated roads or highways, regional
         transportation plan, and local congestion management agency plans.
      2. The project traffic would not increase traffic volumes at affected intersections to more
         than 44,000 vehicles per hour.
      3. The project traffic would not increase traffic volumes at affected intersections to more
         than 24,000 vehicles per hour where vertical and/or horizontal mixing is substantially
         limited (e.g., tunnel, parking garage, bridge underpass, natural or urban street canyon,
         below-grade roadway).

The project would not conflict with the Sonoma County Comprehensive Transportation Plan
established by the Sonoma County Transportation Authority. In regards to the second and third
criteria, intersection traffic volumes would be substantially less than 44,000 and 24,000 vehicles
per hour, respectively. The estimated increase in traffic volumes caused by project-related traffic
would not be substantial relative to background traffic conditions, nor would project traffic
significantly disrupt daily traffic flow on area roadways.

Based on the BAAQMD's criteria, project-related traffic would not lead to violations of the carbon
monoxide standards and therefore, no further analysis was conducted for carbon monoxide impacts
of the project at these intersections. This impact would be considered less than significant on a
project-level and cumulative basis.

Mitigation: None required.




Impact 24.4: Operation of the Central Site Alternative could create objectionable odors
affecting a substantial number of people. (Significant)

Potential generation of odors associated with operation of the Central Site Alternative would have
the same impacts, regulations, and controls as those described under Chapter 5, Air Quality,
Impact 5.5 (2011 Draft EIR). Additional information was provided by the Sonoma County
LEA, however, which indicated that the agency has received 35 odor complaints so far for
the year 2012 and 19 odor complaints between the years 2003 through 2011 for the existing
composting facility (Sonoma County Environmental Health and Safety Section, 2012). These
cControls described in Impact 5.5 of the 2011 Draft EIR include the implementation of an
Odor Impact Minimization Plan (see Appendix AIR-7) as required by law. The Odor Impact
Minimization Plan includes two major components, a Complaint Response Protocol and an Odor
Complaint Reporting Format. The Odor Complaint Response Protocol describes the procedures to
follow upon receiving a complaint. The protocol includes measures to identify the odor and

Recirculated Draft EIR                                                                      October 2012

                                                                          24. Air Quality/Central Site Alternative




requires appropriate adjustments to storage, process control, and facility improvements to reduce
odors.

There are a few factors that would affect odors in the area compared to the existing compost
operation at Central Disposal Site. The main factor potentially increasing odors would be the
increase of feedstock up to 200,000 tons per year. Factors that would decrease odors in the area
are the use of a food pre-processing building, the use of covered aerated static piles (compared to
windrow composting for the existing operations) and the location of the site, which would be to
the west of the current compost operation and farther from the Happy Acres subdivision.

Mitigation Measure

        Mitigation Measure 24.4: Same as Mitigation Measure 5.5 (Odor Control) (2011 Draft EIR).

        Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant.

        Compliance with the Odor Impact Minimization Plan would assure that odor impacts from
        composting would be less than significant.




Impact 24.5: Implementation of the Central Site Alternative may lead to increases in chronic
exposure of sensitive receptors in the vicinity to certain toxic air contaminants from various
stationary and mobile sources. (Less than Significant)

Similar to the proposed project, TAC emissions sources at Central Site would include heavy
duty equipment used on-site, haul trucks used to transport material to and from the site and fugitive
emissions associated with composting activities. Since Central Site would process less amount
of material as the proposed project, it was assumed that the emissions rates estimated for the Central
Site would be less than the proposed project as a proportion of the material processed. Please see
introductory information in Impact 5.6 (2011 Draft EIR), which is the same for Impact 24.5.
Additional information is included in the HRA as part of Appendix AIR-6.

The majority of land uses surrounding the Central Site are agricultural in nature with areas of open
space. Single-family rural residences are scattered in the surrounding area and often present on
sites with agricultural operations, such as dairy farming and grazing. The closest residence to the
Central Site composting area is approximately 500 feet northeast. Other residences are approximately
1,000 feet to the south, 4,500 feet to the east (Happy Acres subdivision) and 5,000 feet to the
southeast. Dunham Charter School is located approximately 4,000 feet north of the Central Site.
Urban development associated with the City of Cotati is located approximately 2.5 miles
northeast of the Central Site. The Petaluma Municipal Airport is located approximately 8.5 miles
southeast of the Central Site.

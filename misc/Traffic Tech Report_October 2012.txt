                                Technical Report
                                    Traffic
1.0 Introduction
1.1     Purpose of Report
This Traffic Technical Report has been prepared in support of the Bottineau Transitway Project Draft
Environmental Impact Statement (Draft EIS). The objective of this report is to evaluate the Project's
potential traffic impacts within the study area. This includes the following:

    Evaluate the Project's potential impacts on traffic operations at existing and proposed signalized
    intersections at or adjacent to the transitway.
    Identify proposed roadway improvements to address operational issues identified in the traffic
    analysis.
A project description and further context for this and all other technical reports can be found in the
Project Description Technical Memorandum.

2.0 Technical Analysis
2.1     Regulatory Context/Methodology
2.1.1 Legal and Regulatory Context
There are no specific legal or regulatory requirements governing how traffic impacts are identified,
analyzed, and addressed as part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review. The analysis
of impacts conducted for the Bottineau Transitway Project, and documented in this technical report,
adheres to industry standards, as described below in Methodology.

2.1.2 Study Area
The analysis of traffic operations for the Bottineau Transitway Project included existing and proposed
signalized intersections along the Bottineau Transitway alternative alignments. In addition, several
unsignalized crossings of the transitway that are planned to be controlled with automatic gates have
been included in the analysis.

2.1.3 Methodology
The approach to the traffic operations analysis is derived from the established methodologies
documented in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). The HCM contains a series of analysis
techniques for evaluating the operations of transportation facilities under specified conditions. The
Bottineau Transitway traffic models have been developed using Synchro/SimTraffic and VISSIM,
software packages that implement the HCM methodologies. The inputs into the models include lane
geometrics, existing and forecast turning movement volumes, intersection traffic control devices, and
signal timing characteristics. The level of service thresholds, as defined by the HCM, are shown in
Table 1. Based on standard practice in the traffic engineering industry, as well as guidance from the
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and conformance with
MnDOT and Hennepin County practice, level of service D/E is considered to be the threshold of
acceptable level of intersection operations during the peak hour for urban and suburban areas.

          F                  >80                    >55

The traffic operations analysis has also incorporated the requirements and standards documented in
the Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MN MUTCD) relative to requirements for
signal preemption and gate operations.

All full access intersections with the transitway, (i.e., locations where all vehicular movements are
allowed) are assumed to be signalized to provide safe movement of transit light rail vehicles (LRV)
and motorized vehicles. In addition, at-grade roadway crossings with transit LRV speeds greater than
35 miles per hour (mph) are required to be equipped with automatic gates, based on the MN MUTCD
standards.

2.2     Environmental Consequences
2.2.1    Operating Phase Impacts
No-Build Alternative
The 2030 No-Build analysis results provide a baseline comparison to determine the impacts of the
Bottineau Transitway Project. The intersections shown in Table 2 were chosen based on the capacity
or near-capacity operations in the existing conditions and the potential for unacceptable operations in
the future (LOS E or F). Therefore, intersections that were shown to have acceptable operations (LOS
D or better) in the 2030 Build conditions were not also modeled for the 2030 No-Build conditions
since no improvements would be required in the 2030 Build conditions and the 2030 No-Build traffic
operations would be expected to be the same or better.

The results of the 2030 No-Build analysis for the PM peak hour are shown in Table 2. For more
detailed analysis and results discussion, see the Trunk Highway 55 (Olson Memorial Highway)
Corridor and Bottineau Segment D2 Traffic Analysis Technical Memoranda in the Appendix.

Transportation System Management Alternative
A traffic operations analysis was not performed for the Transportation System Management
Alternative (TSM) because the TSM alternative is very comparable to the No-Build alternative from a
traffic operations perspective. Therefore, a TSM alternative would not provide additional information
relative to identifying impacts of the Bottineau Transitway Project.

Build Alternatives
The analysis approach of traffic impacts resulting from the Build Alternatives is discussed in the
following sections for each segment of the alignment. Intersections identified as operating with
transit priority would allow an approaching LRV to influence the signal timing (e.g., extended green
phase), but no signal phases would be skipped. Intersections identified as operating with preemption
indicates that an approaching LRV would never stop at the intersection, which would result in some
signal phases being skipped during a preemption event, in order to provide for the LRT phase. The
focus of the operations analysis was the PM peak hour because it has the highest volumes and would
therefore represent a worst-case condition. For further discussion of priority and preemption
operations, see the Transit/Traffic Signal Operating Schemes Technical Memorandum in the
Appendix.

1The initial operational analysis for Alignment A was completed using Synchro/SimTraffic because the
program provides the ability to efficiently analyze a number of different geometric and operational
parameters. VISSIM was used to model operational features beyond the capability of the
Synchro/SimTraffic software where needed. For additional discussion, see the Bottineau Alignment A
Traffic Analysis Memorandum in the Appendix.

The results of the 2030 analysis for the PM peak hour are shown in Table 4. The CSAH 81 (Bottineau
Boulevard)/CSAH 130 (Brooklyn Boulevard) intersection is expected to operate at or near capacity
(LOS E). However, this is not due to any effect caused by the operations of the Bottineau Transitway
Project because the transitway is proposed to be grade-separated over CSAH 81 (Bottineau
Boulevard)/CSAH 130 (Brooklyn Boulevard), which will eliminate any potential influence of transit
operation on overall intersection operations at this location. The grade-separated transitway crossing
of CSAH 130 (Brooklyn Boulevard) at CSAH 81 (Bottineau Boulevard) is warranted because this
intersection is expected to operate near unacceptable operations even with significant capacity
improvements as part of the CSAH 81 (Bottineau Boulevard) reconstruction project. The other
intersections analyzed are expected to have overall acceptable operations during the peak hour. For
more detailed analysis and results discussion, see the Bottineau Alignment A Traffic Analysis
Memorandum in the Appendix.

Alignment B

Alignment B includes CSAH 103 (Broadway Avenue), which is currently in the planning stages for a
roadway reconstruction project. The CSAH 103 (Broadway Avenue) corridor roadway project is a
planned improvement by Hennepin County, separate from the Bottineau Transitway Project between
CSAH 30 (93rd Avenue) and Candlewood Drive. The proposed improvement includes expanding the
roadway from a two-lane undivided to a four-lane divided section, with a median wide enough to
accommodate the LRT transitway. A date for the start of construction on the CSAH 103 (Broadway
Avenue) has not been established, but it has been assumed that the project would be completed
before the start of construction on the Bottineau Transitway project.

A summary of the Alignment B modeling assumptions is shown in Table 5. All modeling was
completed in VISSIM based on the preemption operations.

The queues at the CSAH 9 (42nd Avenue) at CSAH 8 (Broadway Avenue) intersection were also
evaluated to determine whether there would be any safety issues due to vehicle queues from the
signal extending to the at-grade Transitway crossing. The modeling showed that the maximum
eastbound queue on CSAH 9 (42nd Avenue) from the CSAH 8 (Broadway Avenue) intersection would
be expected to be approximately 210 feet compared to a storage distance of 350 feet. Therefore, no
impacts are expected due to the Bottineau Transitway and no improvements are proposed.

The results of the 2030 analysis for the PM peak hour are shown in Table 10. Although the TH
55/CSAH 2 (Penn Avenue) intersection is expected to operate at LOS E, this would actually be an
improvement over the 2030 No-Build conditions (as summarized in Table 2) due to significantly less
delay. The improvement in intersection operations is due to intersection geometric improvements
proposed as part of the Bottineau Transitway Project that allow the northbound/southbound phases
to operate concurrently, rather than split phased. The intersection geometric improvements are
proposed to include median modifications, realignment of the northbound and southbound approach
lanes, and additional striping to guide left-turning vehicles through the intersection.

Alignment D2
The operational analysis for Alignment D2 was completed using Synchro/SimTraffic and VISSIM. Left-
turn movements along the alignment were assumed to be prohibited where left-turn lanes could not
be provided, which occurred at the following intersections:

    CSAH 81 (Broadway Avenue) and 29th Avenue (approximately 60 left-turn vehicles in the PM
    peak hour)
    CSAH 81 (Broadway Avenue) and 26th Avenue (approximately 80 left-turn vehicles in the PM
    peak hour)
    CSAH 81 (Broadway Avenue) and Penn Avenue (CSAH 2) ­ eastbound only (approximately 30 left-
    turn vehicles in the PM peak hour)

As a result of the reduced capacity and left-turn restrictions on CSAH 81 (Broadway Avenue), some
drivers may choose to divert to other routes. The Metropolitan Council travel demand model was used
to determine the magnitude of expected traffic diversions in 2030 due to the capacity reductions and
turn restrictions. The diversion is forecast to be approximately 20 percent of through traffic along
CSAH 81 (Broadway Avenue) and CSAH 2 (Penn Avenue). The travel demand model shows that
approximately 500 to 1,000 vehicles per day would be expected to divert from CSAH 81 (Broadway
Avenue) and CSAH 2 (Penn Avenue) to sections of TH 100, I-94, Lowry Avenue, and CSAH 2 (Penn
Avenue) north of CSAH 81 (81).Broadway Avenue). A summary of the Alignment D2 modeling
assumptions is shown in Table 11.

The results of the 2030 analysis for the PM peak hour are shown in Table 12. The TH 55/CSAH 2
(Penn Avenue) intersection is expected to operate at LOS E, but with significantly less delay than in
the 2030 No-Build conditions (see Table 2). The improvement in operations is due to intersection
geometric improvements that allow the northbound/southbound phases to operate concurrently,
rather than split phased. These improvements include median modification, realignment of approach
lanes, and additional striping. For more detailed analysis and results discussion, see the Bottineau
Segment D2 Traffic Analysis Memorandum in the Appendix.

Alignment D Common Section
The analysis of the intersections in the Alignment D Common Section was completed using VISSIM.
Analysis of the intersections on TH 55 from Van White Memorial Parkway through the I-94 ramps is
currently being discussed with MnDOT. This discussion includes operation of the TH 55/I-94 ramp
intersections with one controller instead of two, and any queuing issues that might impact freeway
operations. The operational results for these intersections will be incorporated when available. A
summary of the Alignment D Common Section modeling assumptions is shown in Table 13.

Alignment D at The Interchange

As part of the modeling analysis for The Interchange project, four alternatives were analyzed for the
connection of the Southwest and Bottineau Transitways into The Interchange. The results of the
analysis showed that acceptable traffic operations (LOS D or better) could be achieved at the TH
55/7th Street/6th Avenue intersection with one LRT line crossing the intersection at-grade, but that
some roadway improvements would be necessary. The modeling showed that at-grade crossings of
both LRT lines would result in unacceptable traffic operations, therefore this alternative was not
considered to be feasible. The design of The Interchange project was based on the following
considerations:

    Track elevations approaching and on The Interchange site
    LRT platform locations and grades
    Location of the LRT crossings relative to the TH 55/7th Street/6th Avenue intersection
    Safety of LRT crossings relative to LRT/vehicle conflicts and control at crossings
    Overall traffic operations at the TH 55/7th Street/6th Avenue intersection

The Interchange preferred alternative provides for a Southwest Transitway crossing of 7th Street
either above or below grade and a Bottineau Transitway crossing of the TH 55/7th Street/6th Avenue
intersection either at-grade or above grade. The Environmental Assessment for The Interchange
documents in detail the stakeholder input and public process that was used to identify the preferred
alternative for The Interchange.

As part of the Bottineau Transitway Project, the analysis was carried forward to identify the roadway
improvements needed to accommodate an at-grade crossing of the TH 55/7th Street/6th Avenue
intersection since this would be the worst case scenario from a traffic operations perspective. A
summary of the modeling assumptions for the connection to The Interchange is shown in Table 14.

The summary of intersections expected to operate at LOS E or LOS F operations in the 2030 PM peak
hour is found in Table 17 In general, all intersections are expected to have acceptable operations
under any of the build alternatives. The LOS E/F operations at the CSAH 81 (Broadway Ave)/CSAH 2
(Penn Ave) and CSAH 2 (Penn Ave)/TH 55 intersections during the peak hour would be expected to
occur in 2030 even if the Bottineau Transitway Project is not constructed.

2.2.2 Construction Phase Impacts
Construction phase impacts were not explicitly evaluated relative to traffic operations. It is anticipated
that construction of the transitway under any of the alternatives would result in traffic disruption,
including lane closures, short-term intersection and roadway closures, and detours that would cause
localized increases in congestion.

2.2.3 Indirect/Secondary Impacts
No-Build Alternative
No indirect or secondary traffic impacts are expected relative to traffic operations as anticipated


October 2012                                                                                                 19
under the No-Build alternative.

Transportation System Management Alternative
No indirect or secondary traffic impacts are anticipated under the Transportation System
Management alternative.

Build Alternatives
No indirect or secondary traffic impacts are anticipated under any of the Build alternatives.

2.3     Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
In general, all intersections are expected to have acceptable operations under any of the build
alternatives. The CSAH 81 (Broadway Avenue)/CSAH 2 (Penn Avenue) and TH 55/CSAH 2 (Penn
Avenue) intersections are expected to operate at LOS F under the 2030 No-Build conditions (without
the project), therefore no mitigation is required as a result of the Bottineau Transitway project.

The TH 55/7th Street/6th Avenue intersection would require geometric improvements to maintain
acceptable LOS operations. 7th St would need to be widened to construct a second exclusive
northbound left-turn lane, providing additional capacity to maintain acceptable LOS operations with
the projected traffic growth.

No permits relative to traffic operations are required. Operation of the traffic signals along the
transitway alignment will continue to be under the jurisdiction of the roadway authority (e.g., city or
Hennepin County).

No specific construction mitigation is proposed. The details of construction staging would be
developed in future stages of project design. Maintenance of traffic (MOT) plans would be required to
be developed by the contractor, and submitted for approval to the roadway authorities. The MOT
plans would address construction phasing, maintenance of traffic during construction of the
transitway, any road closures, and any traffic detours.

3.0 Cumulative Impacts
The convergence of the Southwest and Bottineau Transitways at The Interchange, and the potential
impacts on traffic operations, have previously been analyzed as part of The Interchange project. In
addition, the impacts of the completion of Van White Memorial Boulevard on traffic operations were
previously analyzed during the Alternatives Analysis of the Bottineau Transitway. No other cumulative
impacts relative to traffic operations are expected.

4.0 Summary
The results of the analysis of traffic operations as part of the Bottineau Transitway Project are
summarized in Table S-1 and S-2. In general, all intersections are expected to have acceptable
operations under any of the build alternatives. The CSAH 81 (Broadway Avenue)/CSAH 2 (Penn
Avenue) and TH 55/CSAH 2 (Penn Avenue) intersections are expected to operate at LOS F under the
2030 No-Build conditions (without the project), therefore, beyond the geometric improvements at
those two intersections, no additional mitigation is proposed as a result of the Bottineau Transitway
Project.

Project Overview
The purpose of this study is to forecast future traffic volumes and document traffic and light-rail transit
(LRT) operations along Trunk Highway (TH) 55 in the City of Minneapolis. Figure 1 shows the project
location. It is assumed that LRT will run in the center median along TH 55. Further, the proposed
signal systems along TH 55 will be coordinated to allow both preemption and priority traffic signal
operating alternatives to assist LRT as it travels through the corridor.

This report documents the existing and future traffic conditions along the Bottineau Corridor in the City
of Minneapolis. This report also analyzes the anticipated operational impacts of LRT on the adjacent
roadway system.

The study includes an analysis of existing, no-build, and build scenarios. The no-build scenario includes
minimal network revisions while the build scenario includes the addition of LRT as well as other
network revisions. Twelve key intersections are analyzed in this study. These intersections include:

           TH 55 and Van White Memorial Boulevard
           TH 55 and Bryant Avenue North
           TH 55 and West Lyndale Avenue North
           TH 55 and East Lyndale Avenue North
           TH 55 and Border Avenue/Oak Lake Avenue North
           TH 55/7th Street North and 6th Avenue North
           TH 55/7th Street North and 5th Avenue North
           7th Street North and Oak Lake Avenue North

The existing lane configuration for the key intersections is shown in Figure 2. A description of the
existing roadway geometry is provided in Appendix A.

Traffic Forecasts
The major roadways within the study area are TH 55 (Olson Memorial Highway) and 7th Street North.
On the west side of I-94, TH 55 is classified as a principal arterial. The dominant land-uses adjacent to
TH 55 in this area are multifamily residential and undeveloped. To the east of I-94, TH 55 and 7th
Street North are classified as `A' minor relievers. The dominant land-uses adjacent to TH 55 and 7th
Street North in this area are industrial and commercial.

TH 55 carries 25,000 vehicles per day (2006) west of I-94 and 11,100 vehicles per day (2005) between
I-94 and 7th Street North. 7th Street North carries 9,100 to 11,800 vehicles per day (2005) between I-94
and I-394.1 Figures 3 and 4 display the existing am and pm peak hour turning movements at the key
intersections. Turning movement data was collected in November of 2008 after the reopening of the I-
35W Bridge and the 5th Street Bridge.

Peak hour traffic forecasts were developed for the key intersections within the project area by applying
an annual growth rate to am and pm peak hour turning movement counts. The annual growth rate was
developed based on a comparison of the average daily traffic (ADT) in the Metropolitan Council's 2000
Base Travel Demand Model and the Metropolitan Council's 2030 Travel Demand Model. These models
were run using current (2008) Minneapolis Draft Comprehensive 2030 socioeconomic data forecasts.

Some minor changes to the Metropolitan Council's 2030 Travel Demand Model were made in this
analysis. Van White Memorial Boulevard from TH 55 to I-394 was added to the network. In addition,
the traffic volumes on side streets were adjusted as necessary based on a review of growth in the
adjacent areas and the model outputs.

The historical growth in traffic along screenlines and the growth in trip generation associated with the
Traffic Analysis Zones were reviewed in order to confirm that the growth factors used were consistent
with model outputs. Selected screenlines were reviewed to make sure that the generalized nature of the
travel demand model is not misrepresenting traffic in a given area. Minor adjustments were made to the
location of Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) centroids to better represent the loadings onto the roadway
network.

A review of the historical traffic volumes in the entire downtown area revealed a slight decrease in
traffic over the past eight years. The Travel Demand Model forecasts increasing population,
employment, and trips in the downtown Minneapolis area between the year 2000 and 2030. The
following is a summary of this information.

Regional Travel Demand Model
The ADT volumes obtained from the Metropolitan Council's 2000 and 2030 Twin Cities
Regional Travel Demand Models were compared in order to develop an annual growth rate for
each leg of the key intersections in the study area. As a check of the forecast growth in the study
area, three screenlines were evaluated in order to compare historical growth rates. These
screenlines also allowed for a comparison of the impacts from changes in the 2030 land-use as
reflected in the 2008 Minneapolis Draft Comprehensive Plan's socioeconomic data. The
screenlines used in this analysis include:

   West of I-94 ­ selected roadways between I-394 and 7th Street North including:
     I-394
     Glenwood Avenue
     TH 55
     7th Street North

   East of I-94 ­ selected roadways along the western edge of downtown between Hennepin
   Avenue and 2nd Street North including:
     Hennepin Avenue
     I-394
     Glenwood Avenue
     TH 55
     7th Street North
     2nd through 4th Streets North
     Washington Avenue
     West River Road

   Downtown ­ all of the major roadways entering downtown Minneapolis inside I-94, I-35W,
   Plymouth Avenue North, and the Mississippi River.

Figure 5 shows the location of these screenlines.

The 2030 socioeconomic data for the downtown Minneapolis area in the 2008 Minneapolis Draft
Comprehensive Plan represents a considerable change from the 2030 socioeconomic data in the
current Metropolitan Council 2030 Travel Demand Model. Table 1 below shows a screenline
comparison between the 2030 ADT outputs using Minneapolis's socioeconomic data and using
Metropolitan Council's socioeconomic data.

Historical Traffic Volumes
Historical traffic growth was also reviewed along the same three screenlines. ADT volumes
were taken from Mn/DOT maps between 1998 and 2006 to develop a historical trend for the
study area. 2007 traffic volumes were not used due to significant temporary changes in travel
patterns as a result of the closure of the I-35W bridge and the 5th Street bridge.

Generally, the historical change in ADT decreased between 1998 and 2006. Traffic volumes
west of I-94 decreased by approximately 1.0 percent per year. Traffic volumes east of I-94
decreased by approximately 0.30 percent per year. Traffic volumes entering and exiting
downtown decreased by approximately 0.6 percent per year. Figure 6 displays the decreasing
trend of traffic entering and exiting the downtown area.

Socioeconomic Data
The approved 2000 and 2030 Metropolitan Council socioeconomic data used in the Travel
Demand Models and the 2008 Minneapolis Draft Comprehensive Plan socioeconomic data were
compared to show how the current projected 2030 socioeconomic data from Minneapolis
compares with the previous projections used in the Metropolitan Council's 2030 Travel Demand
Model. Three areas were defined for this analysis.

                West of I-94 ­ the area bound by I-94, I-394, Penn Avenue, and West Broadway Avenue.
                East of I-94 ­ the area along the western edge of downtown bound by I-94, 15th Street West,
                LaSalle Avenue-8th Street-Hennepin Avenue, Plymouth Avenue North, and the Mississippi
                River.
                Downtown ­ all of the area within I-94, I-35W, Plymouth Avenue North, and the Mississippi
                River.

Figure 5 shows the location of these areas. The results of this comparison are summarized in
Tables 2, 3, and 4. The current 2030 socioeconomic data in the approved Metropolitan Council
2030 Travel Demand Model shows that the population and employment of downtown is
forecasted to increase by approximately 50 percent and 30 percent respectively between the
years 2000 and 2030. The socioeconomic data from the 2008 Minneapolis Draft Comprehensive
Plan shows that the population and employment of downtown is forecasted to increase by
approximately 130 percent and 20 percent respectively between the years 2000 and 2030. These
differences in population and employment result in differences between the traffic forecasts for
the two different models.

The 2030 socioeconomic data in the 2008 Minneapolis Draft Comprehensive Plan has greater
increases in population and lesser increases in employment than what is currently in the
approved 2030 Metropolitan Council Travel Demand Model. The northwest portion of
downtown adjacent to the study area is forecasted to experience a much higher increase in
population in the 2008 Minneapolis Draft Comprehensive Plan data.

Year 2030 Forecasts
The 2030 socioeconomic data from the 2008 Minneapolis Draft Comprehensive Plan was used to
develop the 2030 traffic forecasts for the study area. Annual growth rates for the key
intersections were calculated based on a comparison of the modeled ADT's in the 2000 and 2030
Regional Travel Demand Model with the inclusion of Van White Memorial Boulevard from TH
55 to I-394. The annual growth rates were applied to the existing turning movement counts
taken in the fall of 2008. Based on the future socioeconomic data obtained from the 2008
Minneapolis Draft Comprehensive Plan, the annual growth rates for cross street volumes were
reviewed relative to the change in trip generation for the areas they serve.

     Figures 7 and 8 display the year 2030 am and pm peak hour turning movement forecasts at the
     key intersections. Minor adjustments to the forecasted volumes were necessary in order to
     balance turning movements at the key intersections. These forecasted volumes will be used for
     the 2030 no-build and 2030 build roadway/LRT alternatives analyses.

Operations Modeling Methodology and Assumptions

     VISSIM Methodology
     VISSIM is a microscopic, time step and behavior based simulation model developed to model
     urban traffic and public transit operations. It is approved by Mn/DOT as a method to analyze
     complex transportation systems involving traffic and transit operations under constraints such as
     lane configuration, traffic composition, traffic signals, transit stops, etc., thus making it a useful
     tool for the evaluation of various alternatives based on transportation engineering and planning
     measures of effectiveness.

     In contrast to less complex models using constant speeds and deterministic car following logic,
     VISSIM uses the psycho-physical driver behavior model developed by WIEDEMANN (1974).
     Stochastic distributions of speed and spacing thresholds replicate individual driver behavior
     characteristics. VISSIM simulates the traffic flow by moving "driver-vehicles" through a
     network. Every driver, with specific behavior characteristics, is assigned to a specific vehicle.
     Accordingly, the driving behavior corresponds to the technical capabilities of the vehicle. This
     allows drivers on multiple lane roadways to react to preceding vehicles and neighboring vehicles
     on adjacent travel lanes.

     Level of Service Analysis Criteria
     The traffic operations analysis is based on established methodologies documented in the
     Highway Capacity Manual (TRB, 2000). The results from this analysis are presented in the form
     of a letter grade from A to F, called level of service (LOS). The letter grade provides a
     qualitative assessment of the intersection operations based on the amount of delay per vehicle.
     The LOS system is set up similar to a report card with "A" representing high quality operations
     and "F" representing poor operations. At LOS A, motorists experience very little delay or
     interference. On a roadway or intersection with LOS F conditions, motorists would experience
     severe congestion and extreme delay, i.e., gridlock.

     For intersections, LOS is primarily a function of delay which is dependent on am and pm peak
     hour turning movement volumes, intersection lane configuration, and traffic control. The
     intersection analysis was completed using average control delay as defined by the HCM. The
     threshold values for each LOS for unsignalized intersections are slightly less than for signalized
     intersections. This variance was created because motorists' expectations of the intersection
     differ with the type of traffic control. The LOS analysis criteria for signalized and unsignalized
     intersections are shown in Figure 9.

       Although LOS A conditions represents the best possible level of traffic flow, the cost to
       construct intersections to such a high standard exceeds the benefit to the user. Within an
       urbanized area, it is generally regarded that LOS D provides an acceptable LOS.

Alternatives Analysis
Six different VISSIM alternatives were modeled to analyze the existing and future roadway system.

 1.   Existing (2008)
 2.   2030 No-Build
 3.   2030 Build ­ Baseline
 4.   2030 Build ­ LRT with Typical Signal Operations
 5.   2030 Build ­ LRT with Priority Signal Operations
 6.   2030 Build ­ LRT with Preemption Signal Operations

       Geometrics
       Alternative 1 contains the existing roadway network comprised of traffic signals that permit left
       turns on green. Alternative 2 contains traffic signals that permit left turns on green and slight
       improvements to the roadway network including the addition of right turn lanes on TH 55
       eastbound at Van White Memorial Boulevard and Bryant Avenue. Also, a northbound right turn
       lane and a southbound left turn lane were added to Van White Memorial Boulevard at TH 55.
       Alternatives 3 through 6 had the roadway network revised to add additional capacity at
       intersections or to remove unneeded lanes thus providing needed right-of-way for the proposed

LRT. Protected left turn phases were also added to traffic signals along TH 55. The revisions
mentioned below for Alternatives 3-6 assume the improvements mentioned for Alternative 2
have already been constructed.

   TH 55 and Bryant Avenue North: The exclusive right turn lane becomes a through-right
   turn lane.

   TH 55 and West Lyndale Avenue North: A second exclusive right turn lane to I-94 EB
   was added at the bridge replacing the existing combined through/right turn lane. The
   exclusive right turn lane onto West Lyndale Avenue south was shifted to the south, thus
   widening the roadway an additional lane.

   TH 55 Bridge over I-94: One through lane in each direction was removed.

   TH 55 and Border Avenue/Oak Lake Avenue North: One through lane in each direction
   was removed.

   TH 55/7th Street North and 6th Avenue North: One lane in the eastbound direction was
   removed leaving a through lane, a through-right turn lane, and a right turn lane. A left turn
   lane was added to the westbound approach and an exclusive right turn lane will take the place
   of the existing through-right turn lane. This will reduce the westbound lanes traveling
   through the intersection from three to two. The three lane approach at northbound 7th Street
   will be resigned to include a left turn lane, a through-left turn lane, and a through lane.

The LRT is assumed to operate in the center of the roadway along TH 55 from Van White
Memorial Boulevard through the intersection of 7th Street North and 6th Avenue North. Once
the alignment crosses 7th Street, it veers to the south, crossing the eastbound lanes of 6th
Avenue, and then operates adjacent to the roadway. The alignment remains side running as it
transitions onto 5th Street and enters the station at Target Field. Far-side stations are located at
the intersection of TH 55 and Van White Memorial Boulevard.

Operating Assumptions
The LRT is assumed to operate at a frequency of seven-and-a-half minutes during the peak hours
with a station dwell time of approximately twenty seconds at Van White Memorial Boulevard.
The TH 55 traffic signals are semi-actuated, coordinated in the eastbound and westbound
directions with the exception of the 7th Street and 6th Avenue intersection operating as a fully
actuated signal in Alternative 6. Traffic signals for Alternatives 1, 2, and 6 use VISSIM's
NEMA controllers. Traffic signals for Alternatives 3-5 use VISSIM's RBC controllers.

In Alternative 5, LRT is given priority at traffic signals causing minor street phases to end after
the minimums are reached and possibly causing major street through phases to be extended
beyond their normal maximums in order to minimize LRT delay. Also, once a priority call ends,
calls for additional priority will be ignored for one and one half cycle lengths in an attempt to let
the traffic signal recover and fully service the minor approaches. During this recovery time,
LRT will not be given priority and will have to wait for a green phase.

In Alternative 6, LRT uses preemption by placing an advanced call to the traffic signal warning
that a train is approaching. Phases on the side streets are shortened to allow the LRT to run
through the corridor without delay at intersections. Through phases not conflicting with the train
are allowed to navigate through the intersection while the preemptive call is active. After the
preemptive call is satisfied, the next phase the traffic signal brings up will be the first phase
across the next barrier.

Results
A summary of the levels of service for each alternative is provided below. Tables in Appendix
B provide more detail as to the individual movements at each intersection and the queue lengths
recorded. Train travel times in Alternatives 4-6 were measured from a checkpoint just west of
Van White Memorial Boulevard to a checkpoint just west of the Target Field station.

Alternative 1 ­ Existing (2008) Volumes, Existing Geometry
Table 5 summarizes the existing LOS at the key intersections based on the existing lane
geometry, City of Minneapolis provided signal timing, and 2008 existing traffic volumes as
shown in Figures 3 and 4. In this alternative, all intersections are currently operating at LOS D
or better during the am and pm peak hours. In the am peak hour, the southbound left turning
movement at 7th Street and 6th Avenue is operating at LOS E. In the pm peak hour, the
eastbound right from TH 55 onto eastbound I-94 operates at LOS E. Also, the northbound left
from 7th Street to TH 55 westbound operates at LOS F. These results are consistent with
observed conditions.

Alternative 2 ­ 2030 Volumes, Existing/No-Build Geometry
Table 6 summarizes the LOS based on Alternative 2 lane geometry and forecasted 2030 traffic
volumes as shown in Figures 7 and 8. In this alternative, all intersections operate at LOS C or
better during the am and pm peak hours with the exception of Van White Memorial Boulevard
operating at LOS E during the pm peak hour. The worst movements during the pm peak hour at
Van White, Bryant, and West Lyndale are due to vehicles backing up and slowing down in an
effort to get onto the I-94 eastbound on-ramp. LOS F conditions are also reported for the
northbound lefts at TH 55/Border Ave and for northbound lefts at 7th Street and Oak Lake

Alternative 3 ­ 2030 Volumes, Baseline Build Geometry with Protected Lefts
Table 8 summarizes the LOS based on Alternative 3 lane geometry and forecasted 2030 traffic
volumes. In this alternative, all intersections operate at LOS D or better during the am and pm
peak hours. By adding protected left turn phases to the traffic signals along the LRT corridor,
some intersections experienced additional delay. Delay was reduced by adding capacity along
TH 55 between Van White and West Lyndale and through the addition of a second right turn
lane onto the I-94 eastbound on-ramp. Also, setting the signal at 7th Street and 6th Avenue to a
split-phase for northbound and southbound allowed for two northbound left turn lanes. This
helped reduce delay at 7th Street and at Border Avenue due to a better flow of vehicles through
the coordinated system. The northbound lefts at 7th Street and Oak Lake continue to have a poor
LOS due to poor operations at 7th Street and 6th Avenue causing queues to back up from 6th
Avenue to Oak Lake Avenue.

Alternative 4 ­ 2030 Volumes with LRT, Typical Signal Operations, Baseline Build Geometry
Table 9 summarizes the LOS based on Alternative 4 lane geometry and forecasted 2030 traffic
volumes. In this alternative, all intersections operate at LOS D or better during the am and pm
peak hours. The worst delay movements in both the am and pm peak hours are mostly turning
and through movements that conflict with the high volume movements and the LRT movement
through the intersections. The westbound left turn from TH 55 onto Van White is at LOS F in
the am peak hour. This approach could benefit from dual left turn lanes but additional right-of-
way would be needed to shift through lanes further to the north. During the am peak hour, the
average LRT travel times eastbound and westbound were 4.5 minutes and 4.1 minutes. During
the pm peak hour, the average LRT travel times eastbound and westbound were 4.8 minutes and
5.3 minutes.

peak hours. The result of adding LRT priority to the traffic signals along the corridor was a
slight increase in delay over Alternative 4 results. The issues are still the westbound left turn to
Van White, the westbound left turn to I-94 eastbound, and the capacity constrained intersection
of 7th Street and 6th Avenue. During the am peak hour, the average LRT travel times eastbound
and westbound were 5.1 minutes and 4.4 minutes. During the pm peak hour, the average LRT
travel times eastbound and westbound were 4.8 minutes and 5.0 minutes. The resulting
difference in LRT travel times between Alternative 4 and Alternative 5 are minor. LRT travel
time differences ranged from 36 seconds slower to 18 seconds faster.

Alternative 6 ­ 2030 Volumes with LRT, Preemption Signal Operations, Baseline Build Geometry
Table 11 summarizes the LOS based on Alternative 6 lane geometry and forecasted 2030 traffic
volumes. In this alternative, all intersections operate at LOS D or better during the am and pm
peak hours. The result of adding LRT preemption to the traffic signals along the corridor was a
slight decrease in delay over Alternative 4 results. Compared to Alternative 5, preemption
operates slightly better in the am peak hour and nearly the same as priority in the pm peak hour.
The same issues are still the westbound left turn to Van White, the westbound left turn to I-94
eastbound, and the capacity constrained intersection of 7th Street and 6th Avenue. Since the LRT
receives preemption at all traffic signals, the train travel time between checkpoints was constant
at 3.1 minutes. This results in approximately one to two minutes faster LRT travel times
compared to Alternative 4 and Alternative 5.

Conclusions
The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of LRT operating at-grade in the center median
of TH 55 from Van White Boulevard to 5th Street North. In order to determine the feasibility of at-grade
LRT operations WSB developed 2030 traffic forecasts for the nine intersections included in the study.
These forecasts were based on applying a growth factor to existing traffic counts for the study area. The
growth factor was based on the forecast increase in ADT's between 2000 and 2030 using the
Metropolitan Council's Regional Travel Demand Model and the City of Minneapolis's 2008
Comprehensive Plan socio-economic forecasts. The analysis indicated an average traffic growth rate of
approximately 0.5% per year on TH 55. The analysis of these traffic forecasts for six different
alternatives indicated the following.

       Currently, all intersections in the study area are operating at LOS D or better during the am and
       pm peak hours. However, there are selected traffic movements that operate at LOS "E" or "F".
       The two most congested intersections are the TH 55 and Lyndale Avenue intersection and the
       TH 55 and 7th Street North Intersection. The traffic demand on eastbound TH 55 to turn right
       onto southbound Lyndale Avenue and eastbound I-94 results in queues that extend back through
       the Bryant Avenue intersection and LOS "E" for this traffic movement. Also the northbound and
       southbound left turns on 7th Avenue at TH 55 currently operate at level of service "E" or worse
       in the peak hours.
       Traffic operations on TH 55 are expected to be worse by 2030 as traffic volumes grow. Traffic
       on TH 55 is expected to increase at approximately 0.5 % per year. Van White Memorial
       Boulevard traffic levels are expected to increase significantly upon completion of Van White
       Memorial Boulevard between I-394 and TH 55 and anticipated development. The forecasted
       population and traffic growth along Van White Memorial Boulevard south of the study area will
       create the need for intersection revisions at Van White Memorial Boulevard and TH 55. These
       revisions, including exclusive right and left-turn lanes on Van White Boulevard, were assumed
       in the analysis for the 2030 conditions. A second left turn lane from TH 55 westbound to Van
       White southbound may also be needed to mitigate the delay for this left-turn movement by 2030.
       The analysis indicates that another right-turn lane is needed on eastbound TH 55 for the right-
                                                                                K:\01484-04\Admin\Docs\Final Report-Bottineau\Bottineau - Final Report Nov 2009.doc

                                                                                                              Page 14 of 21 




   turns to southbound Lyndale Avenue and to the eastbound I-94 on-ramp in order to provide an
   acceptable level of service. Without this extra right-turn lane traffic backs up on TH 55 through
   the Van White intersection and results in LOS "E" for the eastbound TH 55 traffic.
   The major traffic operations impact of introducing center running LRT on TH 55 is the increased
   delay experienced by vehicles turning onto, off of, or crossing TH 55. Since through traffic can
   move concurrently with LRT there will be very little impact on TH 55 through traffic. The
   model indicates that the biggest problem will occur in the westbound direction as a result of
   vehicles turning left from TH 55 to southbound Lyndale Avenue / eastbound I-94 ramp. The
   intersection of 7th Street and 6th Avenue is currently experiencing at-capacity conditions. This
   intersection consists of two major roadways that funnel traffic into and out-of downtown
   Minneapolis. Approaches constantly struggle for green time during the peak hours. This makes
   coordination with the rest of the corridor difficult.
   Priority vs. Preemption ­ Although the analysis shows that the overall intersection level of
   service is almost the same between priority and preemption signal operations, preemption does
   make the critical left-turn movement from westbound TH 55 to southbound Lyndale Avenue /
   eastbound I-94 ramp worse, creating queues that extend back to 7th Street.
   Because the length of 3-car trains is more than the storage area on TH 55 between southbound
   Lyndale Avenue and northbound Lyndale Avenue, it is necessary to modify the signal timing for
   these intersections so trains do not become trapped between the intersections. This adds to the
   delays for left-turns at these intersections. Dual left turn lanes may be needed in both the
   eastbound and westbound directions to address this problem if preemption is considered on TH
   55.
   Train Travel Times ­ LRT priority causes the train to experience random delay at some traffic
   signals within the study area. LRT preemption causes no delay to trains within the study area.
   The train travel time through the study area is 3.1 minutes with preemption and 4.4 to 5.0
   minutes with priority treatment.

Existing Roadway Geometry
   TH 55 is a six-lane divided roadway west of I-94 and between I-94 and 7th
   Street North. When TH 55 combines with 7th Street North, south of 6th
   Avenue North, it becomes a six lane undivided roadway.

   7th Street North is a four-lane undivided roadway between I-94 and 6th
   Avenue North.

   TH 55 and Van White Memorial Boulevard: This is a four-legged
   signalized intersection. TH 55 eastbound and westbound approaches each
   have a left turn lane, three through lanes, and right turns allowed from the
   right most through lane. The Van White Memorial Boulevard southbound
   approach has a right turn lane and a shared through and left turn lane. The
   Van White Memorial Boulevard northbound approach has a left turn lane and
   a shared through and right turn lane.

   TH 55 and Bryant Avenue North: This is a four-legged signalized
   intersection with Bryant Avenue North meeting TH 55 on a skew. TH 55
   eastbound and westbound approaches each have a left turn lane, three through
   lanes, and right turns allowed from the right most through lane. Bryant
   Avenue North northbound and southbound approaches each have only a single
   lane shared between right, through, and left turning vehicles.

   TH 55 and West Lyndale Avenue North: This is a signalized intersection
   with West Lyndale Avenue North being a southbound one-way roadway. The
   southbound approach on West Lyndale Avenue North has four through lanes.
   The two right most through lanes are for traffic destined to I-94 eastbound
   while the two left most through lanes are for traffic destined to West Lyndale
   Avenue North southbound. Left turns are allowed from the left most lane
   while right turns are allowed from the right most lane. The eastbound
   approach on TH 55 has four through lanes. Right turning vehicles must
   choose between two destinations, West Lyndale Avenue North southbound or
   I-94 eastbound. Vehicle turning onto West Lyndale Avenue North
   southbound utilize a right turn lane preceding the intersection. Vehicle
   turning onto I-94 eastbound use the right most through lane to turn right once
   they have entered the intersection. A left-turn movement is not possible for
   this approach. The westbound approach on TH 55 has a left turn lane and

   within twenty feet of the intersection. Border Avenue is a one-way
   southbound roadway. The eastbound frontage road approach at Border
   Avenue is also a one-way roadway. The westbound frontage road approach is
   a two-way roadway. Figure 5 displays the lane alignments at this
   intersection. The TH 55 eastbound approach has a left turn lane, four through
   lanes, and right turns allowed from the right most through lane. The TH 55
   westbound approach has a left turn lane, three through lanes, and a right turn
   lane. Border Avenue northbound and Oak Lake Avenue North southbound
   each have two through lanes. Left turns are allowed from the left through lane
   while right turns are allowed from the right through lane.

   TH 55/7th Street North and 6th Avenue North: This is a four-legged
   signalized intersection with 7th Street North meeting 6th Avenue North on a
   skew. The TH 55 eastbound approach has two through lanes and two right
   turn lanes. The 6th Avenue North westbound approach has three through
   lanes. Left turns are allowed from the left most lane while right turns are
   allowed from the right most lane. The 7th Street North southbound approach
   has two through lanes. Left turns are allowed from the left through lane while

   northbound approach has a left turn lane and two through lanes. There is also
   a right turn lane prior to the intersection with a yield condition at 6th Avenue
   North eastbound.

   TH 55/7th Street North and 5th Avenue North: TH 55/7th Street North is
   the major through roadway at this three-legged side street stop controlled
   intersection. 5th Avenue North meets TH 55/7th Street North on a skew. The
   7th Street North southbound approach has three through lanes with right turns
   allowed from the right most through lane. The 7th Street North northbound
   approach has three through lanes with left turns allowed from the left most
   through lane. The 5th Avenue North eastbound approach has a single shared
   lane for left and right turning vehicles.

   7th Street North and Oak Lake Avenue North: This is a four-legged
   signalized intersection with 7th Street North meeting Oak Lake Avenue North
   on a skew. The 7th Street North eastbound approach has two through lanes
   and a bus stop lane that also acts as a right turn lane. Left turning vehicles are
   allowed from the left most through lane. The 7th Street North westbound
   approach has two through lanes. Left turns are allowed from the left through
   lane while right turns are allowed from the right through lane. Oak Lake
   Avenue North northbound and southbound approaches each have two through
   lanes. Left turns are allowed from the left through lane while right turns are
   allowed from the right through lane.
   6th Avenue North and HERC/Metro Transit Access: This is a four-legged
   signalized intersection. 6th Avenue North eastbound and westbound
   approaches each have two through lanes. Left turns are allowed from the left
   through lane while right turns are allowed from the right through lane. In
   addition, 6th Avenue North eastbound trucks entering the HERC facility have
   a right turn lane prior to the intersection. Vehicles that are not trucks entering
   the facility use the right most through lane to turn right once they have entered
   the intersection. The HERC Access northbound and the Metro Transit Access
   southbound approaches each have only a single lane to be shared by right,
   through, and left turning vehicles. Northbound and southbound through
   traffic is unlikely due to the Metro Transit Access being restricted to busses
   only.

   6th Avenue North and 5th Street North: 6th Avenue North is the major
   through roadway at this four-legged side street stop controlled intersection.
   The westbound approach of 5th Street North is a one-way roadway. There is
   a single shared lane for through and right turning vehicles. The 5th Street
   North eastbound approach is a two-way roadway with a single shared lane for

   through roadway at this four-legged side street stop controlled intersection.
   All approaches have a single shared lane for left, through, and right turning
   vehicles.

   5th Street North and 5th Avenue North: Presently, this three-legged
   intersection is all-way stop controlled due to continued road construction in
   the area. A signal will be reinstalled once construction is finalized. The 5th
   Street North westbound approach has a single shared lane for through and
   right turning vehicles. The 5th Street North eastbound approach has a single
   shared lane for through and left turning vehicles. The 5th Avenue North
   southbound approach has a single shared lane for left and right turning
   vehicles.

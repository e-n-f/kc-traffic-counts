1 - Planning Context
                                  The proposed Cobbs Creek Connector Trail is a critical missing link in the East
                                  Coast Greenway, a planned path system that will create a non-motorized route
                                  from Maine to Florida. In the Greater Philadelphia region, the Cobbs Creek
                                  Connector Trail will be part of a 750-mile planned network of interconnected
                                  trails known as "The Circuit" (shown in Figure 1) and will directly connect with
                                  several trails including the existing Cobbs Creek Bikeway, the existing John Heinz
                                  Wildlife Refuge Trail, and the proposed Darby Creek Trail.

                                  The Cobbs Creek Connector Trail will enhance pedestrian and bicycle access to
                                  some of Philadelphia's finest historical, natural, and recreational resources. The
                                  trail will wind past Fairmount Park's historic Blue Bell Inn; recreational facilities
                                  such as the Cibotti Recreation Center and Eastwick Community Park; and the
                                  John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge. Ultimately, Delaware County parks such
                                  as Bosacco Park, Tribett Place Playground and Frank Burr Field would connect
                                  to the trail. The trail will also improve access to and from a myriad of public
                                  transportation options in southwest Philadelphia including bus, trolley, and
                                  regional rail lines.

                                  In addition to its transportation function, the trail is intended to provide social
                                  and environmental benefits to local neighborhoods in both Philadelphia and
                                  Delaware County. By providing the community with a pathway for jogging,
                                  hiking and biking, the completed trail will encourage increased fitness and
                                  enhance access to the region's green space. Providing a safe, convenient, and
                                  comfortable pedestrian and bicycle route is also important for school age
                                  children, and the trail may help to reduce vehicle emissions by converting motor
                                  vehicle trips into walking and bicycling trips.

                                  The purpose of this Clean Air Council-sponsored project is to advance planning
                                  and conceptual design for approximately two miles of new trail between the
                                  existing northern terminus of the Cobbs Creek Trail at 70th Street and the John
                                  Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at the southern end. Planning for the Cobbs Creek
                                  Connector Trail involves identifying alignment alternatives along the length of
                                  the trail corridor, evaluating the feasibility of these alternatives, and ultimately

The trail corridor is located in a heavily developed and densely populated setting.
Adjacent land uses along the corridor are mainly residential, with pockets of
commercial and industrial uses. Community institutions and assets such as the
Cibotti Recreation Center, Penrose Elementary School, Motivation High School,
and Eastwick Community Park are located within close proximity to the trail
alignment.

Though the Cobbs Creek trail corridor is highly urbanized and heavily impacted
by past and current land use practices, it nevertheless offers significant natural,
socioeconomic and cultural features, and more importantly, the potential for
enhancement and preservation of these features. Natural resources include the
creek itself and associated floodplain and riparian forests. The trail corridor is also
an important wildlife travel corridor by virtue of its proximity and connection to
the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge, the presence of extensive designated
parklands and other undeveloped open space, and the corridor's connectivity
with parks/open space in the upper portions of the watershed.

The John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge is, in and of itself, an important wildlife
resource. The Refuge contains the largest contiguous tract of freshwater
tidal marsh in Pennsylvania, and is habitat for a variety of bird, mammal, and                       Heinz               84

Several known and potential historic resources are located in the trail corridor.
Most notable is the Blue Bell Inn, located at the corner of the Cobbs Creek
Parkway and Woodland Avenue. The Inn, built in 1776, is listed on the National
Register of Historic Places and was the site of a battle between Revolutionary
and British forces in 1777. Other known and potential properties of historic
significance along the trail corridor include the Amtrak and CSX railroad bridges.

Parks and recreational features along the corridor are extensive. From north to
south, these resources include the Cobbs Creek Park (between 70th Street and
Woodland Avenue), Colwyn and Bosacco Parks (downstream of the Amtrak
railroad bridge in Delaware County), the Cibotti Recreation Center (between
77th and 78th Streets), and Eastwick Community Park (adjoining the Eastwick
neighborhood between 78th and 82nd Streets).

The 2007 Cobbs Creek Connector Trail Feasibility Study defined a preliminary
long-term alignment and broke the overall trail corridor into four segments
based on key roadway crossings. These segments were retained for this study
and are defined as follows:

     ·   Segment A:        70th Street to Woodland Avenue
     ·   Segment B:        Woodland Avenue to 77th Street
     ·   Segment C:        77th Street to 84th Street
     ·   Segment D:        84th Street to JHNWR

Primary screening considerations for the off-road alternatives included the
regulatory implications of new structures or fill in the Cobbs Creek floodplain,
anticipated costs of structures and associated maintenance, and potential
impacts to environmental resources including wetlands, habitat areas, and
hazardous waste areas. In consultation with the Steering Committee and other
stakeholders, the Project Team eliminated alternatives that were not feasible or
desirable.

Additional quantitative and qualitative factors during the evaluation included:

     ·   Potential impacts to parking, traffic, and utilities
     ·   Potential impacts to environmental resources
     ·   Availability of public right-of-way
     ·   Quality of experience for trail users
     ·   Safety and security
     ·   Input from the community

The technical alternatives analysis evaluation process reduced the initial range of                                  Proposed Trail Corridor for Segment B
feasible alternatives to a preliminary refined set of alternatives. The refined set of
alternatives was then presented to the Steering Committee for a final evaluation.
After discussing and implementing several modifications, a proposed trail
alignment was selected.

6 - Proposed Trail Alignment
The proposed trail alignment shown in Figure 4 was
shaped by data collection, concept development,
alternatives analysis, and stakeholder input between
June 2011 and July 2012. The following section describes
individual segments and key areas in detail. Within this
section, the term "trail" refers to primarily off-road portions
of the facility while "sidepath" refers to portions that are
adjacent to the roadway.

                                                     70th Street/Cobbs Creek Parkway Intersection (Figure 5)
                                                     The existing trail terminates at a curb ramp on the north side of the intersection.
                                                     Trail users would cross the west side of the intersection to access the new portion
                                                     of the trail and continue south on the high ground adjacent to the Cobbs Creek
                                                     Parkway. A 6-foot wide grass buffer area is proposed to separate the trail from
                                                     the roadway.

                                                     The proposed concept improves the intersection geometry to accommodate
                                                     a new crossing of Cobbs Creek Parkway on the south side of the intersection.
                                                     This crossing will provide better access to the trail from neighborhoods to the
                                                     east and make it easier for trail users to access the Dunkin Donuts at the corner
                                                     of 70th Street. The Church Lane approach would be reconfigured so that the
                                                     eastbound right-turn move onto southbound Cobbs Creek Parkway operates
     Existing Intersection Looking West              concurrently with the northbound Cobbs Creek Parkway split phase. The
                                                     eastbound right-turn would then be stopped with a red arrow during east-west
                                                     through movements to allow for a protected pedestrian phase. Preliminary
                                                     traffic analysis indicates that vehicle delay for the overall intersection would
                                                     decrease in the proposed condition (results are included in Appendix B).

                                                     The concept plan also indicates potential areas to handle stormwater
                                                     management. Portions of the paved islands could be candidates for pervious
                                                     materials or plantings to encourage infiltration. Existing grassy areas could also
                                                     be transformed into rain gardens or simply enhanced via increased plantings.

CSX Bridge over Cobbs Creek Parkway (Figure 6)
Proceeding south, the existing CSX bridge over the parkway presents an
obstacle, as there is currently not enough room to accommodate a sidewalk or                     Figure 6: CSX Bridge over Cobbs Creek Parkway
trail beneath the bridge. The proposed solution is to reduce each travel lane to
10 feet, shift the lanes to the east side of the structure, replace the northbound
guide rail with a concrete barrier connected directly to the stone abutment, and
create a 6-foot wide shared-use path through the bridge that is separated from
the soutbound travel lane by a concrete barrier. Traffic calming elements to the
north of the bridge at 70th Street and to the south of the bridge at Greenway
Avenue are important elements of the plan as they would help to reduce
automobile speeds through the bridge area.

Greenway Avenue/Cobbs Creek Parkway Intersection (Figure 7)
A new pedestrian crossing at Greenway Avenue would benefit the project by improving access from the local neighborhood and calming traffic along Cobbs Creek
Parkway. The existing park area would be extended and a new island would be created to channelize the traffic lanes and provide a pedestrian refuge area. Similar to the
70th Street concept, it is recommended that the island areas be designed to enhance stormwater management via rain gardens, plantings, or other pervious treatments.

 South of the Woodland Avenue crossing, the proposed shared-use path is located along the west side of Island Avenue in the sidewalk area. The sidepath alignment
 continues south beneath the Amtrak railroad bridge until just past the PennDOT license center, where it turns west and runs adjacent to the parking lot on a City-owned
 drainage ROW. At the end of the parking lot, the trail traverses a Redevelopment Authority parcel and connects with Wheeler Street. From there, the trail continues along
 the Wheeler "paper street" ROW until Claymont Street, where it veers away from the roadway and towards the creek. The trail then runs roughly parallel to the creek on the

Island Avenue/Woodland Avenue Intersection (Figure 8/9)
A curb extension at the northwest corner in front of the Blue Bell Inn would
provide additional room for bicyclists and pedestrians waiting to make the                     Figure 8: Island Avenue Sections
crossing, while a matching curb extension on the northeast corner would
provide room for an enhanced trolley stop. South of the intersection, a 10-foot
wide shared-use path would use the sidewalk area on the west side of Island

The proposed alignment features a 10-foot wide shared-use path beneath the
Amtrak Bridge in the sidewalk area on the west side of Island Avenue. A 2-foot
wide buffer between the bridge abutment and sidepath is needed to provide
a minimum vertical clearance of 7.5 feet between bicyclists and the archway. A
3-foot wide buffer is also proposed to separate the sidepath from the nearest
southbound travel lane. Both of these buffer areas should be textured and/or
painted to encourage riders to stay within the sidepath limits.

 From Elmwood Avenue, the proposed alignment runs south along the west side of 77th Street as a shared-use path in the sidewalk area. Just south of the Cibotti
 Recreation Center playground, the sidepath would turn away from the street and run west between the recreation center and Penrose Elementary School. The sidepath
 would continue on the north side of Motivation High School and then connect with 78th Street, which is recommended as a trailhead location. On-going environmental
 work by the USEPA at the Clearview Landfill site makes further development of a new trail through Eastwick Park infeasible until remediation and site-regrading are
 completed. Therefore, both near-term and long-term alignments were developed for the stretch between 78th Street and 84th Street. The near-term alignment is an on-
 road route through the neighborhood that eventually connects with 84th Street, while the long-term alignment would create a new trail through Eastwick Park.

The corner of 77th Street and Elmwood Avenue would be reconfigured to
create a dedicated parking area for the ballfields. This concept not only reduces                          Figure 11: 77th Street Sections
the amount of impervious area and provides additional space for landscaping
but also provides additional space for bicyclists and pedestrians. The sidepath
would continue south as a 15-foot wide shared-use area along the west side
of 77th Street. As there is a significant amount of activity in this area, especially
during baseball games and other events, the sidepath should be designed to
reduce potential conflicts with people walking to the recreation center or being

dropped-off at the curb. Potential treatments include signage and striping that
encourage lower bicycle speeds and promote awareness of the path.

Just south of the Cibotti Recreation Center playground, the sidepath would head
west and return to a 12-foot wide off-road trail configuration located between
the recreation center and Penrose Elementary School. Several trees and the
chain link fence will need to be relocated to accommodate the path. A physical                                       EXISTING
separation will also be needed between the trail and the playground, which
could be provided by a low fence, landscaping, or some other treatment.

Long-Term Trail through Eastwick Park (Figure 13/14)
The proposed alignment for this section of the East Coast Greenway would be an
off-road trail through Eastwick Park; however, the timing is complicated by the                 Figure 13: Eastwick Park Trail Sections
USEPA's on-going study of the Clearview Landfill. USEPA has indicated that the
future remedial action for the landfill has the potential to change the topography
within Eastwick Park, which would consequently affect any alignment that is
developed for the trail. As a result, a conceptual trail alignment was developed to
inform future discussions with USEPA regarding alignment and cost; however, it
will likely change based on the outcome of the environmental process.

Eastwick Park currently features an 8-foot wide walking path between 78th
Street and 82nd Street, although large stretches are in disrepair and the overall
geometry was not designed to meet current trail standards. Rather than modify
the existing path, a new 12-foot wide trail is proposed to meet minimum design                        Walking
standards. Except for two shared segments near 78th Street and Angelo Place,                           Path
the new trail would run parallel to the existing walking path but on a new
alignment. The new trail would extend south of 82nd Street via a City-owned
                                                                                                                EXISTING
parcel to connect with the dead-end at Chelwynde Avenue. Figure 14 shows a
rendering of the proposed trail near 78th Street, while conceptual design plans
for the entire trail alignment through Eastwick Park are included in Appendix D.

Near-Term On-Road Route
In the near-term, the proposed trailhead at 78th Street would mark the end of
the off-road trail segment. From there, the trail would transition to an on-road
facility comprised of signage and striping on neighborhood streets. Shared-lane
markings, commonly referred to as "sharrows," would be used to indicate the best
lateral placement for bicyclists and also help alert motorists to the presence of a
                                                                                                 112 inches               72 inches
bicycle route. The on-road route would be striped and signed along 78th Street,
Buist Avenue, 83rd Street, and Chelwynde Avenue. At the end of Chelwynde
Avenue, the route would transition to an off-road trail that begins Segment D.

Segment D: 84th Street to JHNWR
This segment begins at the end of Chelwynde Avenue at the nexus of the near-term and long-term Segment C alignments. From there, the proposed off-road trail
continues east along the 84th Street right-of-way until the intersection with Lindbergh Boulevard. The trail crosses 84th Street on the west side of the intersection and then
continue south along the west side of Lindbergh Boulevard on a new shared-use path that is buffered from the street by a planted bio-swale.

proposed concept would provide room for a new 12-foot wide buffered shared-
use path along the west side of Lindbergh Boulevard while simultaneously
reducing the amount of impervious area. The path would be separated from
the roadway by a 10-foot wide curbed bio-swale comprised of gravel, soil, and
plantings. At 86th Street, the shared-use path would transition from Lindbergh
Boulevard into the JHNWR. Figure 17 shows a rendering of the proposed

        x   Alt. D4: Charles said that the on-road alignment along Buist, 83rd, and
            Chelwynde Streets is a candidate for sharrows due to low traffic volumes and
            speeds. He agreed that the width of Lindbergh Boulevard south of 84th Street
            will provide ample room for a buffered cycle track.

        x   84th Street/Lindbergh Boulevard Intersection: Charles said that a mid-block
            crossing approximately 500 feet west of Lindbergh Boulevard may not have a
            significant impact on traffic if it were timed to work with the adjacent signal. He
            noted that PennDOT has not approved the HAWK pedestrian beacon to be used
            state-wide, so the crossing would need a pedestrian-actuated signal instead
            (although he noted that the pedestrian beacon minimum volume warrants might
            still apply). He also agreed that the existing traffic signal at 84th Street/Lindbergh
            Boulevard was a viable crossing location and would likely be more cost-effective.

        x   For the alternatives affecting state-owned roadways (Cobbs Creek Parkway and
            Island Avenue), Charles said that PennDOT will also need to review and
            ultimately approve of the proposed concepts. Charles mentioned Lou Belmont as
            a potential PennDOT contact for coordination on this project.

       x   Segment A: Rob said that PP&R does not support the structure and tunnel
           alternatives (A2, A3, & A4) due to potential security issues and future
           maintenance costs. The group agreed to retain alternatives A1 and A5 but to
           remove the others from consideration. It was noted that even if A1 becomes the
           preferred alternative, elements of A5 should still be considered to connect the
           neighborhood with the trail (perhaps as part of a future PWD project).

       x   Bill's opinion is that the viaduct (A2) and tunnel (A4) alternatives are not viable
           options because of potential visibility and security issues, along with their
           relatively high cost and complexity. He noted that both alternatives would require
           a substantial amount of engineering review by CSX as they have the potential to
           affect the load-bearing capacity of adjacent structures.

       x   Bill's overall opinion is that the sidewalk alternative (A1) under the CSX bridge
           would not present problems to CSX, primarily because it does not alter the load-
           bearing capacity of the abutments and does not increase access to the railbed. Bill
           noted that CSX currently does not have any plans to replace or modify either of
           the bridges in this corridor. Bill does not believe that CSX has any as-built plans
           for the CSX bridge over Cobbs Creek Parkway, but he will check internally.

       x   CSX has contracted with AECOM to provide design reviews and Alanna
           Strohecker is the current project manager at AECOM. Bill asked for JPG's of the
           before and after condition for A1, which he will circulate internally with AECOM
           for preliminary comments.

             COMMUNITY MEETING October 19th
             4 PM--7 PM Paschalville Library



        Clean Air Council and Urban Engineers will be hosting a Community Open
        House on October 19th in the Community Room of the Paschalville Branch
        of the Free Library at 6942 Woodland Avenue from 4 PM to 7 PM.
        This will be an opportunity to discuss the planned Cobbs Creek Connector
        Trail with the design team and the lead advocates. The bike and multi-use
        trail will run from 70th and Cobbs Creek Parkway where the existing trail
        ends, to the John Heinz Wildlife Refuge. Community members have the
        chance to see what preliminary plans have been made, ask questions, and
        give their input on route options and design of the trail.
        Clean Air Council and Urban Engineers would like as many community
        members as possible to come out to this event! Stop in for as little or as long
        as you would like.
        Refreshments will be served!

     Next Steps

     x    PennDOT does not anticipate the need for further review of the concepts at this
          stage in the project. At the end of this planning effort, Urban will send updated
          concept drawings to PennDOT as an FYI.
     x    PennDOT's role during engineering design will depend on the funding source. If
          Federal funds are involved, then PennDOT will likely have an oversight role and
          a Highway Occupany Permit will not be needed if this occurs.

           was decided to reduce the total width of the proposed sidewalk and bike path space along                                                                            URBAN ENGINEERS, INC.
           77th Street from 24 feet to 15 feet and extend the proposed curb extension further south
           to the rec center building to avoid these impacts. Based on this new width, the bikeway
           through this segment will function more as a "shared area" than a dedicated cycle track.
           This new design will likely require relocation of one utility pole adjacent to the fence.
           The group also agreed that the excess pavement on the east side of 77th Street around the                                                                           John Federico, PE, PP, AICP

Traffic Data Collection
Classified (trucks, buses, cars, bicycles, pedestrians) manual turning movement
counts were performed by Urban Engineers on Wednesday, June 15th, 2011 for
the evening peak period (4:00-6:00 pm) at the following five locations:

     ·   Cobbs Creek Parkway (SR 3015) and Church Lane/70th Street
     ·   Cobbs Creek Parkway (SR 3015) and Greenway Avenue
     ·   70th Street and Greenway Avenue
     ·   Island Avenue (SR 3013) and Woodland Avenue
     ·   84th Street (SR 3002) and Lindbergh Boulevard

The count results for each intersection are included on the following pages.

Traffic Analysis
Synchro Version 7 was used to compare existing and proposed traffic operations
at the following intersections:

     ·   Cobbs Creek Parkway (SR 3015) and Church Lane/70th Street
     ·   84th Street (SR 3002) and Lindbergh Boulevard

Signal timing input was based on traffic signal plans provided by the City of
Philadelphia Streets Department, while the 2009 MUTCD was used to determine
the appropriate pedestrian/bicycle crossing times.

Tables summarizing the existing and proposed results at both intersections are
included at the end of this section.

Notes:
Proposed includes the following to accommodate a crosswalk on the Cobbs Creek NB approach:
- Protected "overlap" phase for EBR turning vehicles during NB Cobbs Creek split phase movement.
- Church EBR turning vehicles have RED arrow during EB Church Phase (i.e., EBR only proceed during NB Cobbs Creek phase)
- Pedestrian clearance interval times based on 2009 MUTCD, Section 4E.06. Distances approximated using Google Earth.

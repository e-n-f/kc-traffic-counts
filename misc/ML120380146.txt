EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

PPL Bell Bend, LLC (PPL) proposes to construct and operate a new nuclear power plant to be
designated as Bell Bend Nuclear Power Plant (BBNPP) located west of the existing Susquehanna
Steam Electric Station (SSES) site. SSES has two units currently operational. The proposed
project is planned for construction over an approximately 7 year period. The new plant is
expected to be operational by December 2021.

As part of this effort, a COLA (Combined License Application) has been filed with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC). This COLA prepared by UniStar Nuclear Energy (UNE) included
an Environmental Report (ER). The ER defined the impacts from the proposed expansion
including traffic impacts. A traffic study completed by KLD Engineering PC (KLD) in 2008 was
incorporated into the ER. As part of the federal application process initial meetings with state
and municipal agencies regarding the traffic study and impacts were conducted in the middle of
2008.

In early 2010, the process of initiating state review of the traffic impact began. A Scoping
Meeting application was conducted on February 17, 2010. Based on follow up discussions with
PennDOT Districts 3-0 and 4-0, the study area was defined (expanded from the 2008 study)
and the assumptions discussed.

The project area was identified based upon the dispersal of trips during the major event,
namely the construction phase peak. Generally, addition of more than 100 trips would lead to
the intersection being a candidate for inclusion, unless PennDOT accepted a rationale for not
considering it. The geography and road network dictated that the affected intersections were
generally along Route 11, with many of the trips travelling to or from I-80 and I-81.

The study area includes 23 intersections across PennDOT Engineering Districts 3-0 and 4-0,
covering the municipalities of South Centre, Briar Creek, Berwick, Nescopeck, Salem Township,
Shickshinny, & Nanticoke.

This report addresses the traffic impacts and mitigation alternatives for the "Future Build" and
for the "Construction Phase Peak", the latter with concurrent "outages" (the period during
which one of the existing units is refueled and maintained, generally occurring once every two
years and lasting approximately one month for each event).

This report is a revision of the previous submittal in October 2010 and addresses comments
from PennDOT District 3-0 and 4-0. Since the earlier submittal, work has been progressing
concurrently with other permit applications both at federal and state level. The planning for
this project has been ongoing for some time and given the scale of this project with the
passage of time, different elements of the planning are revised on a continual basis.

Three such changes were relevant to the traffic circulation: a) The planned construction
schedule has been moved approximately 30 months into the future; b) Design elements have
been shifted internally resulting in additional truck shipments per month for two years over the
course of plant construction; and c) HOP plans are being prepared for SSES entrance driveways
that include changes to intersections. Items a) and c) have been taken into account in this
revision. Item b) does not affect the capacity analysis in this study because it is planned that
these shipments will be timed such that they do not overlap the peak periods considered in this
traffic impact study, nor define a new peak.

In accord with PennDOT procedures, the "Future No-Build (FNB)" (with signals optimized for
that traffic) was used as the baseline for the mitigation. That is, the target that should be
achieved in the "Future Build (FB)" and the "Construction Phase Peak (CONST)" is a level of
service (LOS) that is the same as the "Future No-Build", with mitigation required only if the
change in the average vehicle delay is greater than 10 seconds/vehicle.

Growth factors were based upon PennDOT tables, and data collection was done in accord with
PennDOT requirements.

The trip distribution for the future operational staff for the new Bell Bend plant was based upon
the profile of the origins (by zip code) of workers at the existing SSES units. The trip
distribution of the construction workers was based upon the regional concentration of
population, using U.S. Census data.

For the FB alternative, it was possible to retain the intersection levels of service for all affected
signalized intersections, simply by optimizing the signals for the additional traffic. This was
feasible because the total number of workers at the new plant is estimated to be 363 with trip
patterns dispersed throughout the day.

For the Construction (CONST) case, both the impact of truck movements and of the workers
was considered.

Although there are a very significant number of truck movements over the construction period,
the impact on hourly flow is relatively low (typically 1-2 trucks per hour) due to the duration of
the construction period. Wide loads are avoided, due to planned movements of larger elements
by rail. Concrete is to be made on-site which, among other possible sources, may use materials
from a local quarry along Route 11, east of the site. Local requests to minimize truck trips
during school start/end hours have been considered in scheduling.

The number and concentration of construction worker trips to and from the site do however
add significantly to the traffic loads, and pose substantial challenges for mitigation. The peak
period of construction is estimated to generate 3039 trips to the site per day by auto (and
another 3039 trips from the site), split over three weekday shifts in a 60-35-5 proportion.

To provide a conservative analysis (that is, maximum impact), this traffic was assigned to the
road system as if it all originated from within 40 miles of the site, proportional to the population
concentrations shown in census data. Further, the analysis month used included both the peak
of construction activity and an "outage" at one of the nearby existing units (i.e. a maintenance
and refueling period, with its own significant traffic).

These construction staff trips are estimated to come from the northeast of the site and from
west of site in a 48/52 ratio, based upon census data on population concentrations. The
arrival/departure times at the busiest times actually shifts the peak hour to the construction
schedule.

The duration of the major impact period, when one considers the construction activity profile
and the months on either side of it, is estimated to be 18-24 months long. The duration of an
outage period is one month per year, generally in March.

The primary measures considered and recommended for the "construction phase peak" plus
outage are summarized in Table ES-1.

The values in Table ES-1 are highlighted if one of the following situations arise:
   - There is a change in the LOS from the FNB and the change in delay is greater than 10
       seconds, or
   - If a traffic signal is proposed, the estimated intersection LOS is worse than LOS C.

As shown in Table ES-1 there are a total of five instances ­ two in the AM peak period and
three in the PM peak period (with one common intersection) ­ that do not meet these LOS
requirements. These are three intersections in Berwick west of SR 93 (Orange Street) and a
fourth at the SSES entrance. Three out of the five situations enumerated above exist only
during the Outage periods that occur during the peak construction year(s). That is, for one
month in each of (at most) two consecutive years.

SSES is currently in the HOP process of upgrading their driveways including the main entrance
along SR 11. The upgrades include a dedicated right turn bay into the site for the RT 11 traffic
and conversion of the center lane into a dedicated left turn lane into the site from RT 11. In
order to meet the LOS requirements during the peak of the construction, a traffic signal will
need to be installed and the southbound right turn lane will need to be extended by
approximately 200 feet.

Based on feedback from PennDOT, Table ES-1 does not contain possible beneficial effects of
diversion or routing changes due to LOS at these intersections. Thus, the material contained
herein is a "worst case" analysis to be considered in the PennDOT decision on whether to allow
a special condition at these four intersections, during the peak of the construction period, i.e.
LOS D for these intersections.

Overall, the analysis leads to the conclusion that specific mitigation is needed, as shown in
Table ES-1, at an estimated cost of $4.0 million (excluding construction at the site access road)
as detailed in the text.

With regard to the overall traffic plan, the proposed site includes a parking lot to handle the
expected construction traffic demand. The onsite security checkpoints are to be placed such
that there is no spillback onto S.R. 11. There are some construction lay down areas east or
south of S.R. 11, but these do not affect the impacts described herein.

In the "Future Build" condition, with the new Bell Bend plant operational, all traffic impacts can
be mitigated simply by signal optimization.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Project Objective

PPL Bell Bend, LLC proposes to construct and operate a new nuclear power plant to be
designated as BBNPP located west of the existing Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES)
site. SSES has two units currently operational. The proposed project is planned for
construction over an approximately 7 year period. The new plant is expected to be operational
by December 2021. Figure 1 presents and overview of the site.

As part of this effort, a COLA (Combined License Application) [1] has been filed with the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). This COLA prepared by UniStar Nuclear Energy (UNE)
included an Environmental Report (ER). The ER defined the impacts from the proposed
expansion including traffic impacts. A traffic study completed by KLD Engineering, P.C. (KLD) in
2008 was incorporated into the ER. As part of the federal application process initial meetings
with state and municipal agencies regarding the traffic study and impacts were conducted in the
middle of 2008.

This report is a revision of the previous submittal in October 2010 and addresses comments
from PennDOT District 3-0 and 4-0. The District 3-0 and District 4-0 comments and responses
are included in Appendix O and Appendix P respectively. Since the earlier submittal, work has
been progressing concurrently with other permit applications both at federal and state level.

The planning for this project has been ongoing for some time and given the scale of this project
with the passage of time, different elements of the planning are revised on a continual basis.
There have been updates to the study assumptions related to the schedule and other
intersection improvements at the SSES driveway. These changes have been incorporated in
this report.

1.2 Study Methodology

Traffic impact studies (TIS) are designed to analyze the effects of industrial and commercial
activity, and growth on local transportation infrastructure. The goal is to determine whether
the infrastructure is capable of handling the incremental traffic added to a highway system
during construction or operation of new facilities. It is important to maintain safe traffic
operations while maintaining, to the maximum extent possible, the quality of traffic flow in a
community. In a typical TIS, the following traffic conditions are analyzed as shown in Figure 2:

    The existing traffic condition, determined by field data collection and standard traffic
    engineering computations on the field data;
    The future no-build (FNB) condition assumes that the proposed project is not built, and
    characterizes the future traffic condition based upon the growth of the existing traffic, plus
    any traffic from approved projects that are not included in the standard growth factors;
    The future build (FB) that includes the proposed project and all the elements included in the
    FNB.

In addition, given the nature and size of the construction effort required for a nuclear power
plant, the study includes analysis of the traffic impact (and mitigation plan) during construction.
This is done for the heaviest construction month at the latest date that also includes an outage
at the existing unit. This is called the construction + outage condition, and is also shown in
Figure 2.

The first step in the TIS is to define the study area, generally based on the expected site trip
generation. This is followed by a field data collection effort to define the existing operating
conditions. Considering background growth and other planned developments, the Future No-
Build (FNB) condition is defined. This is followed by determining the impacts when the new
power plant is operational (Future Build, or FB) and during construction (Future Year
Construction Peak) by comparing to the reference condition (Future No-Build, or FNB). The
analysis of operating conditions is based on the peak-hour traffic volumes and level of service
criteria as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual. The mitigation measures are defined (if
needed) for the Future Build and Future year construction conditions such that the resultant
change in the level of service with the mitigation, meets the guidelines for acceptable levels of
degradation in traffic operations compared to the Future No-Build condition.


1.3 Study Area

The project study area was identified based upon the dispersal of trips during the major event,
namely the construction phase peak. The geography and road network dictated that the
affected intersections were generally along Route 11, with many of the trips travelling to or
from I-80 and I-81.

Based on the location of the site, the major travel routes to/from the site would be the
following:

From   the   North West and North ­ Route 239 and Route 11
From   the   North East and East ­ I-81, Route 29, and Route 11
From   the   South East, South and South West ­ I-80, Route 93 and Route 11
From   the   West ­ Route 93 and Route 11

The primary travel route in the study area is Route 11. This route is part of the US Highway
system and is the responsibility of the State of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT). PennDOT references the highway as State Route 11 or S.R.11 or SR 0011 in their
drawings. This naming convention has been adopted in this study and is equivalent to U.S. 11
or Route 11.

The study area intersections were identified as the major intersections that were on route for
the operations and construction workforce at the Bell Bend site. The operations workforce for
the Bell Bend site is expected to have a spatial distribution similar to the current workforce at
SSES. However, the construction workforce for the Bell Bend site is expected to be derived
from all areas surrounding the site based on the census block population. That is, the more
populated areas such as Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton would have higher contributions to the
construction workforce.

     In early 2010, the process of initiating state review of the traffic impact began. A Scoping
     Meeting was conducted on February 17, 2010. Based on follow up discussions with PennDOT
     Districts 3-0 and 4-0, the study area was defined. Appendix A lists the communications with
     PennDOT and scoping meeting information.

     The list of study area intersections is shown in Table 1 and Figure 3.
     The study area includes 23 intersections across PennDOT Engineering Districts 3-0 and 4-0,
     covering the municipalities of South Centre, Briar Creek, Berwick, Nescopeck, Salem Township,
     Shickshinny, & Nanticoke.

      2. DATA COLLECTION

      Table 2 presents the summary of the field data collected. Vehicle turning movement counts
      were collected manually on weekdays between 6AM and 9AM and, between 3PM and 6PM by
      field personnel. At each intersection, 2 to 3 people were stationed to record vehicle turning
      movements. These turning movement counts were used for the analysis of intersection
      operations. Automatic Traffic Recorders (ATR) were placed along the locations identified in
      Table 2 to collect hourly traffic flows for a 1 week duration. The ATR data collected along the
      SSES Entrance was used to develop the daily profile of the traffic entering and leaving the site at
      the existing power plant. This data was collected during normal operations. This information
      was used to estimate the arrival and departure patterns across the day for the workforce related
      to the new power plant and the outage staff at SSES. Appendix B presents all field data
      collected.

      3. EXISTING STUDY AREA CONDITIONS


      3.1 Existing Roadway Conditions

      Road surveys were conducted to assess roadway geometry and pavement conditions within the
      study area. These were supplemented with aerial imagery available from Google Earth©/Google
      Maps©, Microsoft Live Maps© and MapQuest©. Based on the road surveys, all roadways appear
      to be in good condition. The roadway condition diagrams are included in Appendix C of this
      report. These condition diagrams define the posted speed limit, lane assignments and
      intersection traffic control. The existing traffic control permits for the study area were provided
      by PennDOT Districts 3-0 and 4-0 for the study area intersections. These plans are included in
      Appendix D.


      3.2 Existing Level of Service (LOS) and Capacity Analysis

      Based on the field data collected, the peak hours for the existing traffic are identified based on
      the sum of the actual traffic volumes on all approaches of the intersection, and presented in
      Table 3. Due to varying cross street traffic, nearby intersections can actually have slightly
      different peak hours in the observed data. The volumes in these peak hours are shown in
      Figures 4 and 5.

The ability of a roadway network to accommodate projected traffic volumes generated by a
proposed development during its construction and operation is assessed utilizing techniques to
measure capacity and Level of Service (LOS). LOS is an ordinal scale that is defined from A to F
with "A" being the best level of service. The different levels are defined in the year 2000 edition
of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 20001) [2], in terms of average delay for intersections
and average travel speed for arterials. Typically, the LOS is determined for the peak 1-hour
during the identified periods as it represents "worst case" conditions.

The definitions as presented in the HCM 2000 [2] for LOS are the following:

                                                               Average Delay

                                                     C            >   15 to 25

                                                     D            >   25 to 35
                  Intersections)
                                                     E            >   35 to 50

Based on PennDOT guidance [3] through [8] the HCM LOS output as estimated by SYNCHRO [9]
is applied for the analysis throughout this report. Unsignalized intersections (stop controlled)
were analyzed using the HCM Methodology as implemented in the HCS+ software [10]. In
addition to the reports from SYNCHRO and HCS+, the calculations of the queues in the left turn
lanes, the turn lane warrants, and left turn factors have been performed according to PennDOT
guidelines.

Table 4 presents the LOS and average delay for the existing conditions. Appendix E presents the
worksheets for the LOS computations related to the analysis of the existing conditions.

Note 1: * implies this is a stop controlled intersection. The intersection LOS was calculated based on the
weighted average of approach delays as specified in Reference [3].
Note 2: The cells with LOS D or worse are highlighted.


Based on the values in Table 4, except at the signalized intersections of SR 11 & Poplar in
Berwick, the intersections appear to be operating acceptably, LOS C or better. The intersection
of SR 11 and SR 29 (Mill Street) is currently being upgraded to a signalized intersection and
hence has been analyzed as a signalized intersection. As seen in the discussion in the following
section, signal retiming improves the LOS at SR 11 (Front Street) and Poplar Street in Berwick.

4. FUTURE YEAR NO-BUILD CONDITIONS


4.1 Regional Growth and Other Developments

The proposed project is planned for construction over an approximately 7 year period. The new
plant is expected to be operational by December 2021. This year was selected for the analysis
of the Future Build (FB) and Future No-Build (FNB) conditions.

Based on guidance from PennDOT (growth factor tables) this report uses a compounded growth
factor of 0.42% and 0.77% for urban non-interstate roads in Luzerne County and Columbia
County respectively. The growth rate table is shown in Appendix F. Using these growth factors
and the existing traffic volumes, the future traffic volumes are calculated. These volumes were
used for the LOS and capacity analyses. The future no-build results assume that the signals
settings were optimized using SYNCHRO.

There are two planned changes to the existing highway network: a) traffic signal that is being
installed at S.R.11 and S.R.29 (Mill Street) in Nanticoke and b) the proposed upgrades to the
SSES driveways. Besides these, there are no major highway development/improvement projects
planned within the study area to influence the capacity of the roadway system. The forecasted
volumes were analyzed using the existing highway network and the aforementioned two items.
The LOS analysis is presented in Table 5.

The resulting peak hour volumes during the weekday AM and PM peak hours are shown in
Figures 6 and 7. The LOS computations and capacity analysis are presented in Appendix G.

As seen in Table 5, there are three intersections that operate at LOS D or worse. They are
signalized intersections of SR 11 & County Bridge in Nanticoke, SR 11 & Poplar Street in Berwick,
and the stop controlled intersection of SR 11 and SR 29 also in Nanticoke.

These LOS values will be the reference to determine the required mitigation for the Future Build
conditions.

5. DESCRIPTION OF DEVELOPMENT

5.1 Site Access

A new intersection along SR 11 is proposed for the Bell Bend Plant. This is approximately 1.5
miles south of the existing entrance for SSES along SR 11. The site entrance is proposed to be
located immediately due east of the existing transmission line right-of-way (ROW) which crosses
SR 11. Figure 8 shows the location of the planned site access intersection and site access
roadway. The site plan is included as part of Appendix M on page M-78. Based on the
estimated flows during construction this will be designated as a high volume driveway.

Nuclear Power Plant is not listed under those tables. Instead, data provided by UniStar Nuclear
Energy2 (UNE) and traffic data collected at the SSES entrance, is applied to estimate the trip
generation expected on site from the new plant.

It is anticipated that when the new plant is operational, it will require a maximum of 363
additional employees on site.

UNE estimates that the average vehicle occupancy for these employees is 1.0 implying that the
new plant will generate 2(363) = 726 additional trips per day, counting arrivals and departures.
These additional employees are assigned the same demographics as those on site and working
on the existing SSES units.

5.3 Site Trip Distribution and Assignment

The staff size for the existing 2 units is approximately 1000 employees (822 full-time and 178
contractors).


Figure 9 represents the arrival and departure distribution across the workday of the power plant
employees at the SSES Entrance along SR 11. These are derived from the ATR counts collected
at the SSES Entrance.

It is anticipated that the new employees at the Bell Bend site will use the proposed access road
east of Confers Lane along Route 11.            Therefore, the new trips anticipated on site will be
assigned onto the Bell Bend access road based on the temporal distribution shown in Figure 9.


The resulting trip generation of the operations staff at the new plant during the peak hours is
the following:


          AM Peak Hour (veh/hour): IN = 165, OUT = 24
          PM Peak Hour (veh/hour): IN = 2, OUT = 142


The traffic to/from the site is assigned as follows. Using the employee zip codes the spatial
distribution of the workers on site is shown in Table 5. The spatial analysis was performed using
ArcGIS3 [12]. As shown in Table 6, most of the current operations workforce is drawn from the
west (Berwick). Using this distribution and the available routes, the operations traffic leaving the
site is assigned as shown in Figure 9.

6. FUTURE YEAR BUILD CONDITIONS


6.1 Analysis of Future Build (FB) Conditions

With the additional traffic, the operating LOS is expected to change and deteriorate. PennDOT
provides the following guidelines (as extracted from the PennDOT guidance [4]) regarding
mitigation needed to address the LOS deterioration:

         10-second variance
         If evaluation of the Future Build to the Future No-Build indicates that the overall
         intersection LOS has dropped, the applicant will be required to mitigate the LOS if the
         increase in overall intersection delay is greater than 10-seconds.

         If the overall intersection delay increase is less than or equal to 10-seconds, mitigation of
         the intersection will not be required. If the intersection LOS meets the level of service
         requirements, applicants may still be required to provide mitigation to address critical
         lanes or approaches.

         For locations where the level of service of the Future No-Build is LOS F, the remedies
         shall provide an estimated delay which will be no worse than the delay for the Future No-
         Build.

         LOS Requirements
         Following are LOS Requirements for the TIS:

         Existing Signalized Intersections
         Future Build overall intersection LOS should be no worse than Future No-Build overall
         intersection LOS, except as noted previously. Critical movements and approaches shall
         be evaluated and queues shall be evaluated to ensure that available storage exists for
         critical movements.

         Existing Unsignalized Intersections
         The evaluation of the performance of unsignalized/stop controlled intersections should
         include more than just the LOS and delay. Measures of effectiveness such as v/c ratios
         for individual movements and queue length shall be considered by applicants and
         presented in the TIS regardless of whether the following LOS requirements are met.

         Following are LOS requirements for unsignalized intersections:
          Overall intersection LOS for Future Build scenarios should be no worse than Future
             No-Build scenarios. If lane movement LOS drops occur, the toolbox for unsignalized
             evaluation should be considered.

             If signalization is the preferred alternative for mitigation, overall intersection LOS C in
             rural areas and LOS D in urban areas is acceptable.
             If a drop in LOS occurs but the intersection does NOT satisfy warrants that justify a
             traffic signal or roundabout, other options should be explored to mitigate as
             discussed below, Mitigation Analysis.
             If other mitigation measures are not applicable, municipal input is required to seek
             Department approval for an unsignalized intersection Design (LOS) Waiver.

         New Driveways
         New signalized or unsignalized intersection established to serve as access to the
         development shall be designed to operate at minimum LOS C for rural areas, and
         minimum LOS D for urban areas.

         Mitigation Analysis
         1. If the LOS requirements are not met, the Applicant is responsible to construct
            improvements that will mitigate the LOS drop.
         2. If the LOS requirements are not met, and the improvements are determined to be
            impractical or infeasible, there are three opportunities available for the applicant to
            pursue:
                 a. Local Land Use Transportation Plan with Marginal LOS Degradation
                 b. Alternative Transportation Plan with Significant LOS Degradation
                 c. Design Waiver ­ LOS

         Figure 11, is an excerpt from Reference [3] that illustrates the three options (a) through
         (c).

         Condition 1: Marginal LOS Degradation, Local Land Use and Transportation Plan
         If the LOS requirements are not met and improvements required to mitigate the impacts
         are impractical or infeasible, the applicant may evaluate the use of the Marginal LOS
         Degradation condition. Marginal Degradation is defined as overall intersection LOS within
         LOS range of LOS B to LOS C for rural areas, and LOS B to LOS D for urban areas.

         The Department will consider accepting the Marginal LOS Degradation based on
         municipal input and review of the Municipal Land Use and Transportation Plan to ensure
         congestion and delay are managed in the study area. The Municipal Land Use and
         Transportation Plan and correspondence from the municipality should be provided as part
         of the TIS submission.

         Condition 2: Significant LOS Degradation, Alternative Transportation Plan
         If the LOS requirements are not met and improvements required to mitigate the impacts
         are impractical or infeasible, the applicant may evaluate the use of the Significant LOS
         Degradation condition.

         Significant Degradation is defined as overall intersection LOS below LOS range of C in
         rural areas and D in urban areas. A significant degradation may be acceptable if:
         1. The Department concurs that improvements are demonstrated to be infeasible AND
         2. The Department concurs that foregoing the improvements will jeopardize neither
             public safety nor the highway/bridge infrastructure; AND
         3. The degradation to overall intersection is acceptable to the municipality; AND

         4. The Applicant prepares an Alternative Transportation Plan to address improvements
            to the transportation network which are accepted by the municipality and
            Department. The implementation of the Alternative Transportation Plan may not
            always completely mitigate LOS drops, as its purpose is to improve congestion and
            delay in the transportation network by promoting other transportation strategies.

         Alternative Transportation Plan
         An Alternative Transportation Plan (ATP) should encompass a wide range of strategies
         that will enable the future improvement of conditions for motorists, pedestrians,
         bicyclists, and transit users within the study area. It extends beyond mitigation
         strategies that can be implemented by the applicant directly, to encompass strategies
         that should be implemented by public agencies.

         Condition 3: Design Waiver ­ LOS
         In the event that Conditions 1 or 2 are unachievable, a Design Waiver - LOS may be
         applied for as outlined in Department Publication 282 - Highway Occupancy Permit
         Guidelines. Due to the variety of alternative mitigation options available to applicants, a
         very small percentage of waivers are anticipated to be granted by the Department.


6.2 Total Traffic Volumes and Projected LOS During Future Build Conditions

Using the estimated traffic in the Future No-Build conditions and the site trip generation as
discussed in Section 5.2, Figure 12 and Figure 13 present the peak hour volumes estimated
during the Future Build condition with the existing roadway system.

The LOS corresponding to the peak hour volumes are presented in Table 7. Appendix I presents
the worksheets for the LOS computations related to the analysis of the Future Build Conditions,
with the existing roadways.

As presented in Table 7, the change in average intersection delay is less than the acceptable
threshold of 10 seconds for all intersections between the FB and FNB. Hence no mitigation is
required for the FB.

7. FUTURE YEAR CONSTRUCTION CONDITIONS

The construction is planned over approximately 7 year duration. The expected time line for
construction is mid 2014 through mid 2021. The work is expected to be distributed over 3 shifts
a day, 5 days a week. The shift timings are the following:
    Shift 1: 7:30 AM to 4:00 PM
    Shift 2: 4:00 PM to 12:00 AM
    Shift 3: 12:00 AM to 7:30 AM

7.1 Site Trip Generation and Access

The additional traffic expected on site during construction can be grouped into 3 major
categories:
    -    Operational Staff for Bell Bend
    -    Heavy Vehicles to haul in materials, and
    -    Construction Staff

This traffic will be impacted by the "bi-annual" outage at the existing SSES units, the duration of
which is typically one month (March). The construction staff and heavy vehicle shipments and
the operations staff expected on site will access the site using the proposed site access road for
Bell Bend (east of Confers Lane along Route 11). The SSES outage staff (refueling) will access
the site using the SSES site access as they will be plant employees and will use the existing
parking lot on site.

7.1.1 Operational Staff for Bell Bend

The new plant will require 363 additional personnel upon completion and it is estimated that
some of the operational and other staff will be required onsite for testing before completion.
Using this information, a conservative assumption is made that the number of new plant
personnel on site during the peak construction month will be 363. Assuming an average vehicle
occupancy of 1.0 for these employees, the number of trips expected to be generated are 726
(2*363) trips daily in the peak construction month.

7.1.2 Outage Staff for SSES

The existing 2 units currently operate on a 24-month outage schedule, with each unit staggered
by year. Table 8 presents the outage schedule for the next 4 outages. During each outage it is
expected to have an outage workforce of 1400 personnel on site. These personnel work on the
same shift schedule as the existing employees (2 shifts 6AM-6PM, 6PM-6AM) and will be
distributed across the day and directionally assigned similar to the operational staff (Table 6).
The calculations to derive the assignment are shown in Appendix H.

                            Controlled Document


                                  Table 8 ­ Outage Schedule
                     Unit Outage 1 Outage 2 Outage 3 Outage 4
                     Unit 1 March 2011 March 2013 March 2015 March 2017
                     Unit 2 March 2012 March 2014 March 2016 March 2018

Assuming average vehicle occupancy of 1.0 for these employees also, 2800 trips are expected to
be generated each month shown in Table 8.


7.1.3 Heavy Vehicles

It is expected that the heavy permanent plant equipment loads to include the Turbine Generator,
Diesel Generators, Large Transformer, and Nuclear Steam Supply will be brought to the site by
rail, the backfill and excavation will occur on site and all other plant material will arrive by road.
The breakdown of the materials arriving on site is presented in Appendix J.                There are
construction lay down areas south and east of the proposed site access road, along S.R.11.
Access to these lay down areas is restricted during shift change to minimize impacts.


Based on the data provided by UNE, it is expected that a total of 67,879 15-ton-shipments will
arrive through the construction schedule. Of these shipments, 56,557 are expected to arrive in
all the shifts, over the first 60 months, 6 days a week (Monday-Saturday) and the remaining are
expected to arrive over the first 60 months only during the day shift. The set of 56,557 will be
referred to as Concrete Material Shipments and the 11,322 will be referred to as Other
Shipments.      It is assumed that each 15-ton shipment will arrive on separate tractor-trailers
leading to an average of 39 trucks and 8 trucks per day for the Concrete Material Shipments and
Other Shipments, respectively. The spatial distribution of the heavy vehicles is discussed in the
next section along with the construction staffing.


In addition to these shipments, UNE estimates that there is a need for 0.5 Million-yd3 of
engineered fill material, 0.2 Million-yd3 of lean concrete material, and 0.8 Million-yd3 of cohesive
fill material. Using a 15 yd3 per truck shipment, this translates to 2000 to 5200 truck shipments
per month for up to 24 months in the middle of the construction period. The number of truck
trips per hour will vary depending on the month and will be restricted during the shift change
periods to minimize traffic impacts.

7.1.4 Construction Staffing

The construction is planned over a period of approximately 7 years. The workforce expected on
site will vary through this period with a maximum of 3950 workers/day on site. The work is

expected to be distributed over 3 shifts a day, 5 days a week. The shift timings are presented in
Table 9.

It is expected that the average vehicle occupancy for these workers will be 1.30, based upon
expert guidance from a construction contractor (via UNE) from their experience in its large
construction projects. This is reasonable for a concentration of workers at such an extended-
duration job; using the year 2000 journey to work census data, the average vehicle occupancy
for the construction workers in the vicinity of Bell Bend, is estimated to be between 1.09 and
1.17 (Appendix K). Also, this value of 1.3 has been applied to similar traffic impact studies at
sites in Maryland, New York, and New Jersey. This was one of the assumptions discussed at the
scoping meeting with PennDOT.


Based on the census block data the major population centers would be logical sources for the
construction staff. Using the 2000 census data within 40-miles of the site, Table 10 presents the
spatial distribution of the construction workers.

It appears from Table 10 that most of the traffic will come from the North East (NE) and South
East (SE) directions. These correspond to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton region and Hazleton areas
respectively. Using these percentages and the available routes to the site the construction and
heavy vehicle traffic departing the site is assigned to the study area intersections as shown in
Figure 14. A similar distribution is assumed for the traffic arriving on site and shown in Figure
15. The calculations to derive these percentages are shown in Appendix H.

7.2 Site Trip Distribution and Assignment

The construction is over an approximately 7 year period. During this time, the background
traffic continues to grow each year in accordance with PennDOT's projected growth factors, and
outages (maintenance and refueling) occur at the existing units. As a result, for a conservative
analysis, the month of the outage coincident with this duration of maximum construction activity

Note that the construction traffic actually causes the peak hour to shift. The resulting peak
periods are shown in Table 11.

                    Table 11 ­ Peak Hours Identified for Construction Traffic

                                               Peak Peak Hour

These hours are used in the analysis for this section of the report. The total traffic generated on
site is the total of the 4 categories discussed in Sections 7.1. The number of trips during the
construction peak hour is presented in Table 12.

                   Note: Outage at SSES is shown as part of trip generation for completeness.
                   However this is part of the background traffic condition as it occurs at the
                   existing SSES units. This is used to determine the baseline traffic flows under
                   the Future No-Build condition.


The trips in Table 12 are assigned to the study area based on the spatial distribution of the
construction workforce, operations, outage, and heavy vehicles and paths to the Bell Bend site,
as discussed in section 7.1. The resulting flows are shown in Figures 17 and 18.

7.3 Total Traffic Volumes and Projected LOS During Future Year Construction
    Conditions

There are two planned changes to the existing highway network: a) traffic signal that is being
installed at S.R.11 and S.R.29 (Mill Street) in Nanticoke and b) the proposed upgrades to the
SSES driveways. Besides these, there are no major highway development/improvement projects
planned within the study area to influence the capacity of the roadway system.

As discussed earlier, the outage occurring at SSES will affect the traffic arriving at the Bell Bend
site. The trip generation for the outage traffic as discussed in the preceding sections is used to
define the background conditions No-Build condition for the construction cases. The existing
traffic is forecasted to the year 2022 (first occurrence of the outage after completion of
construction) and then added to the outage related traffic. This corresponds to the LOS values
shown under FNB in Table 13.

Using this as the baseline, the construction year conditions are analyzed. The traffic generated
by the construction staff, operations staff and heavy vehicles as shown in Table 12 used to
estimate the flows under the future year construction conditions.

Figure 19 and Figure 20 present the peak hour volumes estimated during the Future Year
Construction Condition with the existing roadway system.

The LOS corresponding to the peak hour volumes are presented in Table 13. Appendix L
presents the worksheets for the LOS computations related to the analysis of the Future Year
Construction Conditions, with the existing roadways, and optimized traffic signal settings.

As seen in Table 13, almost all of the intersections require further mitigation and improvements.
The following section discusses mitigation proposed for each intersection.

8. MITIGATION

8.1 Overview of Mitigation Issues

The mitigation measures proposed generally include the following items:
       a) Traffic Signalization/Signal Retiming
       b) Addition of turn bays
       c) Lane add/drop over short sections for critical movements
       d) Intersection redesign

The goal of the above measures is to minimize delay experienced by vehicles driving through the
intersection and meet the requirements for allowable change to intersection delay. The addition
of turn bays and lane add/drop do not change the number of lanes on the arterial being used,
but increase storage and discharge capacity at the intersection approaches, thereby reducing
overall delay experienced by vehicles. However, it is important to note that the practicality of
items b) through d) is influenced by available real estate/right of way.

The study area includes intersections in the following municipalities ­ South Centre, Briar Creek,
Berwick, Nescopeck, Salem Township, Shickshinny, and Nanticoke. The roadway conditions in
Berwick, Nescopeck, and Shickshinny are such that, in most cases, it is impractical to suggest
roadway improvements beyond traffic signalization/signal retiming. This is related to the fact
that there are no shoulders and very limited room to add travel lanes. However, in the other
three municipalities (South Centre, Briar Creek and Salem Township), there is the possibility of
adding lanes/turn bays along SR 11.

Figure 21 shows the following key considerations that have to be addressed in the development
of the traffic mitigation plan:

     Consideration 1 - Berwick: SR 11 through Berwick is a critical capacity constraint in
     both the AM and PM peak periods. There are three key items:
        o The single lane along NB SR 11 (Front Street) downstream of the merge with SR
            93 (Market Street), limits the traffic load that can arrive to the site from the
            south/west.
        o The single lane on SR 11 SB (2nd Street) past Walnut Street, and the split
            between SR 93 (Orange Street) and SR 11, limits the traffic load in the SB
            direction on SR 11.
        o There is insufficient room to add lanes/turn bays along SR 11 in Berwick; the only
            feasible alternative to increase intersection capacity is to restrict street parking in
            the vicinity of the intersection during certain times of day (shift change etc.)

     Consideration 2 ­ Shickshinny: Similar to the Borough of Berwick, there is insufficient
     room to add lanes/turn bays along SR 11; the only feasible alternative to increase

         intersection capacity is to restrict street parking in the vicinity of the intersection during
         certain times of day (shift change etc.) or temporary use of shoulders.

Note: Items 1-3 are discussed in the text as considerations to be taken into account


                          Figure 21 ­ Considerations for Traffic Mitigation

     Consideration 3 - Nanticoke: There are two key items:
        o The stop controlled intersection of SR 11 (E. Poplar Street) and SR 29, is a
           capacity constraint that needs to be addressed if the construction workforce can
           arrive on site, efficiently. This intersection needs improvement, possibly a
           redesign with a traffic signal, to handle the forecasted traffic loads.
        o The intersection of County Bridge and SR 11 is currently operating at LOS D and
           is forecasted to operate at LOS E in the future year No-Build conditions.

Taking in account the above discussion, mitigation was determined for each intersection and
analyzed.

8.2 Proposed Mitigation

The following two sections discuss the mitigation measures proposed at each intersection within
the study area for each of the two PennDOT districts. There is a subsection devoted to each
intersection which provides both an illustrative figure and a table containing the LOS and delay
during the Future No-Build and the Construction Phase peak with a concurrent outage both
before and after mitigation. Highlighted cells in the tables represent a condition where average
delay after mitigation has been implemented exceeds the Future No-Build by greater than 10
seconds/vehicle. The LOS computations and worksheets for each of the following intersections
are presented in Appendix M. Also, for each intersection where left turn lanes are recommended
or modified left turn warrants, left turn storage requirements and left turn conflict
factors/phasing were computed using the PennDOT guidance [8], where applicable.


The analysis of these measures was supplemented with traffic visualization generated by
SimTraffic4 [9], the companion tool to SYNCHRO. This tool helps to gain insights into traffic
operations and related queuing. In addition to the static analysis in the HCM of determining the
LOS for the peak hour based on the peak 15-min volumes, this tool allows the analysis of the
peak hour with the individual traffic loads in 15-min increments.



8.3 Proposed Mitigation: PennDOT District 3-0

8.3.1 S.R. 11 and S.R. 2028
This intersection located in South Centre, is currently signalized. Heavy flows on S.R. 11 NB
during the AM peak require the addition of a through lane. This is achieved with a lane add and
subsequent drop further north as shown in Figure 22.                       The lane add/drop was analyzed to
ensure that the lane drop downstream of the intersection did not result in any spill back. This
allows the intersection to function at acceptable levels in both the AM and PM peak periods as
shown in Table 14. The storage provided for the left turn bay meets PennDOT requirements.
Appendix M presents the related calculations.                     Also the signal phasing recommended is
Protected/Permitted which is based on PennDOT guidance.

8.3.2 S.R. 11 and Briar Creek Plaza Driveways

This signalized intersection is located in Briar Creek, at the entrance to the Briar Creek Plaza.
Heavy flows on S.R. 11 SB during the PM peak require the addition of a through lane servicing
this movement. The proposed improvement is similar to SR 11 and SR 2028, as shown in Figure
23. This improvement results in acceptable levels in the PM as shown in Table 15. However it
does not meet the 10 sec maximum allowable change requirement during the AM, and needs to
be a discussion item with PennDOT. It must be noted that this condition only exists during the
outage which corresponds to one month in each of (at most) two consecutive years. Also, the
turn bay storage recommended meets PennDOT requirements. Appendix M presents the related
calculations.

8.3.3 S.R. 11 (Front Street) and Eaton Street

Eaton Street, presently a two way stop controlled intersection in Berwick, experiences an
increase in delay for the side street approaches that are well in excess of 10 seconds as shown
in Table 16. Appendix M also includes a traffic signal warrant analysis for this intersection that
shows that the traffic signal warrants [12] are not satisfied for the Existing, Future No-Build, or
Construction Conditions. However, if a traffic light is installed during the construction period, the
delays for the Eaton Street will be reduced. When analyzed as a signalized intersection during
the construction period, the intersection performs at LOS C or better which meets the PennDOT
requirement. The turn bay storage recommended meets PennDOT requirements. Appendix M
presents the related computations.

8.3.4 S.R. 11 (Front Street) and Poplar Street

This is a signalized intersection in Berwick.     There is limited room for intersection capacity
improvements because there is no shoulder; refer to in Figure 25. However, signal optimization
improves the LOS of this intersection compared to the unmitigated case as shown in Table 17
and results in acceptable levels of the LOS. The recommended permitted left turn phasing and
recommended turn bay storage meet PennDOT requirements. Appendix M presents the related
calculations.

8.3.5 S.R. 11 (Front Street) and Orchard Street

This intersection is approximately 0.5 miles east of Poplar Street in Berwick and the two streets
share some characteristics in that there is limited room for intersection capacity improvements
as shown in Figure 26. Signal optimization and restriping on Poplar Street results in acceptable
LOS during the PM peak period as shown in Table 18. However it does not meet the 10 sec
maximum allowable change requirement, and needs to be a discussion item with PennDOT. The
resulting LOS D would be acceptable under a special condition from PennDOT and input from the
Borough of Berwick as it is an urban area, and will be part of the discussion with PennDOT. The
recommended turn bay storage meets PennDOT requirements. Appendix M presents the related
computations.

8.3.6 S.R. 11 (Front Street) and S.R. 93 (Orange Street)

This signalized intersection in Berwick is constrained in terms of increasing the capacity by
widening or adding to the intersection (see Figure 27). At this intersection, signal optimization
improves the level of service marginally, as shown in Table 19. However, it does not meet the
10 sec maximum allowable change requirement, and needs to be a discussion item with
PennDOT. The resulting LOS D would be acceptable under a special condition from PennDOT
and input from the Borough of Berwick as it is an urban area, and will be part of the discussion
with PennDOT.


The recommended turn bay storage does not meet PennDOT requirements.                   Appendix M
presents the related computations.        However the SimTraffic visualizations suggest that the
queues resulting from the turn bay insufficiency will not lead to a system wide problem on SR 11
and is limited to this intersection. The companion disk to this report provides the SimTraffic files
to support this observation.

8.3.7 S.R. 11 (Second Street) and Market Street/S.R. 11 (Front Street) and Market Street

This is the one way pair for S.R. 11 at the S.R. 93 (Market Street) bridge in Berwick. Signal
optimization and retiming at Second Street mitigates all impacts as shown in Table 20.
However, at Front Street, the traffic is heavy along EB S.R. 93 and NB S.R. 11 and requires
restriping as shown in Figure 28. Restricting street parking along S.R. 11 and providing a shared
through/right turn lane improves the capacity to service traffic NB on S.R. 11. Similarly, along
S.R. 93 towards the bridge, an additional through lane is added.


Traffic headed to the site from SR 11 and SR 93 merge onto the single lane approximately 0.6
miles from this intersection. Inspecting the SimTraffic visualization, it was observed that there is
queuing from the intersection with Walnut Street, but the spillback does not occur into this
intersection.

Traffic on SR 11 (Second Street) arrives through Walnut Street, which is the start of the one-way
pair of SR 11 Front Street/Second Street in Berwick. This short section along Walnut Street
needs improvements (lane restriping) to handle the increased loads during the future year
construction conditions. Appendix M provides the details of this improvement.

8.4 Proposed Mitigation: PennDOT District 4-0

8.4.1 S.R. 11 and Bell Bend Site Access

The design of the site access road is included under the mitigation section, because it is related
to the impacts and operating level of service at nearby intersections. The proposed site access
road would require a fully actuated signal to provide efficient service to the traffic demand.
Signalization would be temporary only for the duration of construction (traffic signal warrant
analysis, provided in Appendix M shows that the traffic signal warrants are not satisfied).


Two NB left turn bays will be provided to assist the main shift arriving from the south and west
in the AM. In the PM, the main shift exodus is heavy and as discussed earlier, is relatively even
split, in both directions along S.R. 11. As such, two left turn lanes and two right turn lanes are
needed to assist these flows. Given the high volume in and out of the site during the AM and
PM respectively, it is recommended that the site access road be flared as a four lane road with
two lanes given to each direction in the vicinity of the intersection. The layout is shown in
Figure 29. Also, based on discussions with PennDOT District 3-0, for the traffic exiting the site
RTOR (Right Turn On Red) is prohibited at this intersection.


There is direct access to a laydown area south of S.R. 11 from this intersection. This area is not
expected to generate large volumes of traffic so the approach is defined with 1 lane in each
direction. Also, during the construction phase peak hour, trips in/out from this lay down area
will be restricted, so that the intersection may operate efficiently to handle flows in/out of the
Bell Bend site. The resulting LOS is C or better in both the AM and PM periods.


The recommended turn bay storage does not meet PennDOT requirements.                   Appendix M
presents the related computations.      However the SimTraffic visualization suggest that the
queues resulting from the turn bay insufficiency will not lead to a system wide problem on SR 11
and is limited to this intersection. The companion disk to this report provides the SimTraffic files
to support this observation.


8.4.2 S.R. 11 and SSES Site Entrance

The existing plant entrance is presently an unsignalized intersection. SSES is currently in the
HOP process of upgrading their driveways including the main entrance along SR 11.               The
upgrades include a dedicated right turn bay into the site for the RT 11 traffic and conversion of
the center lane into a dedicated left turn lane into the site from RT 11. In order to meet the LOS
requirements during the peak of the construction, a traffic signal will need to be installed and the

southbound right turn lane will need to be extended by approximately 200 feet as shown in
Figure 30. The traffic light is recommended to be installed during the construction period in
order to reduce delays (Appendix M includes the traffic signal warrant analysis that shows the
warrants are satisfied in the existing, future no-build conditions). When analyzed as a signalized
intersection during the construction period, the intersection performs at LOS D, as shown in
Table 21. However, for period other than the outage, the LOS is acceptable at LOS C or better.
This needs to be a discussion item with PennDOT.

The recommended turn bay storage does not meet PennDOT requirements.                   Appendix M
presents the related computations.           However the SimTraffic visualization suggest that the
queues resulting from the turn bay insufficiency will not lead to a system wide problem on SR 11

At this signalized intersection in Shickshinny, restriping the lanes along S.R. 11 NB and SB S.R.
11 results in LOS A and LOS B during both AM and PM peaks respectively, as shown in Table 22.
The restriping would include converting SB S.R. 11 as two through lanes with a shared left turn
lane, converting the NB S.R. 11 to two through lanes with a shared right turn lane and
repurposing the large shoulder along S.R. 239 as a right turn bay, as shown in Figure 31.

8.4.4 S.R. 11(Main Street) and S.R. 239 (Union Street)

At this signalized intersection in Shickshinny, signal optimization results in an intersection level
of service comparable to the Future No-Build conditions during the PM peak periods (as shown
in Table 23). However, during the AM peak period, there is heavy demand in the EB and SB
directions and the volumes are high for the single lane approaches. By using the parking lane
for the right turns from S.R. 239 (Union Street) going from EB onto S.R. 11 SB, and using the
parking lane along SB S.R. 11 as shown in Figure 32, the intersection will operate at LOS B.

8.4.5 S.R. 11 and S.R. 29 (Mill Street)

Mill Street, in Nanticoke, is most heavily impacted during the PM peak. There is not enough
capacity in the existing intersection to service all of the movements as well as the predominant
NB flow on S.R. 11. There is very little room to expand the intersection due to surrounding
development, topology and an adjacent bridge directly east of the intersection which prevents
widening. As a result, a modified T-intersection with a free NB movement uncontrolled by the
signal is recommended as shown in Figure 33. The EB left turn coming from Mill Street is
channeled into a central acceleration lane and subsequent merging section over the bridge in
an area currently occupied by the TWLTL (Two-way Left Turn Lane). The resulting LOS is
within acceptable levels as shown in Table 24, with these proposed changes.                     The
recommended turn bay storage meets PennDOT requirements.                Appendix M presents the
related computations.

8.4.6 S.R. 11 and County Bridge

This signalized intersection in Nanticoke is also heavily impacted during the PM peak. There is
not enough capacity in the existing intersection to service all of the movements as well as the
predominant NB flow on S.R. 11. Similar to Mill Street, there is limited room to expand the
intersection due to surrounding development, topology and an adjacent bridge directly south of
the intersection. The proposed design (Figure 34) repurposes the TWLTL on S.R. 11 NB to
create a second through lane. The relatively flat and open area in the intersection's south east
corner is used to add a receiving lane. The two lanes continue to join with the existing two
lane section of S.R. 11. A raised island is used to channelize vehicles through the intersection.
The resulting LOS is within acceptable levels as shown in Table 24, with these proposed
changes.     The recommended turn bay storage meets PennDOT requirements.                    Appendix M
presents the related computations.

8.4.7 S.R. 11 (E. Poplar Street) and S.R. 29

This intersection in Nanticoke is currently unsignalized. It is recommended that a traffic signal
be installed during the construction period for an efficient route to access the site for the
construction workforce (the traffic signal warrant analysis in Appendix M shows that traffic
signal warrants are satisfied in the existing and future no-build conditions). The recommended
configuration is shown in Figure 35. This includes restricting the left turn from SB SR 11. This
displaces up to 4 vehicles per hour onto a redundant path to S.R. 29 south located on the
opposite side of the interchange.          Prohibiting this left turn combined with signalization will
create a safer intersection. The resulting intersection LOS is C, as shown in Table 26. The
recommended turn bay storage meets PennDOT requirements.                     Appendix M presents the
related computations.

8.5 Construction Cost for Proposed Mitigation

The following section provides approximate cost estimates for the proposed mitigation. Table
27 and Table 28 present the unit costs and the cost summary of the proposed mitigation,
respectively. No cost is assumed for the mitigation measure of traffic signal retiming.

                                       Table 27 ­ Unit Costs

 Item                         Cost ($)       Units

 Build Travel Lane             $ 350         Per linear foot of 12-feet wide pavement

 Build Shoulder                $ 200         Per linear foot of 12-feet wide pavement
 Resurface Shoulder            $ 150         Per linear foot of 12-feet wide pavement
 Restrict Parking              $ 10,000      Per block of street parking
 Lane Restriping               $ 25,000      per intersection approach
 Traffic Signal                $ 250,000     per intersection
 Rearrange Signal Heads        $ 75,000      per intersection
 Acquire Property              $ 250,000     per location

The cost of building the site access intersection is excluded as part of this table. Excluding this
item, the approximate cost of the proposed roadway improvements is $ 4.0 Million.

Also, based on PennDOT recommendation, discussions were conducted with the Berwick Signal
Contractor. The existing condition of the signal hardware (controller and detectors) is such it
would require upgrades/replacements to support the recommend signal settings as part of
mitigation. This has been added as a separate cost item in the estimation.

8.6 Summary of Mitigation

The primary measures considered and recommended for the "construction phase peak" plus
outage are summarized in Table 29.

The values in Table 29 are highlighted if one of the following situations arise:
   - There is a change in the LOS from the FNB and the change in delay is greater than 10
       seconds, or
   - If a traffic signal is proposed, the estimated intersection LOS is worse than LOS C.

As shown in Table 29 there are a total of five instances ­ two in the AM peak period and three
in the PM peak period (with one common intersection) ­ that do not meet these LOS
requirements. These are three intersections in Berwick west of SR 93 (Orange Street) and a
fourth at the SSES entrance. Three out of the five situations enumerated above exist only
during the Outage periods that occur during the peak construction year(s). That is, for one
month in each of (at most) two consecutive years.

SSES is currently in the HOP process of upgrading their driveways including the main entrance
along SR 11. The upgrades include a dedicated right turn bay into the site for the RT 11 traffic
and conversion of the center lane into a dedicated left turn lane into the site from RT 11. In
order to meet the LOS requirements during the peak of the construction, a traffic signal will
need to be installed and the southbound right turn lane will need to be extended by
approximately 200 feet.

Based on feedback from PennDOT, Table 29 does not contain possible beneficial effects of
diversion or routing changes due to LOS at these intersections. Thus, the material contained
herein is a "worst case" analysis to be considered in the PennDOT decision on whether to allow
a special condition at these four intersections, during the peak of the construction period, i.e.
LOS D for these intersections.

Overall, the analysis leads to the conclusion that specific mitigation is needed, as shown in
Table ES-1, at an estimated cost of $4.0 million (excluding construction at the site access road)
as detailed in the text.

With regard to the overall traffic plan, the proposed site includes a parking lot to handle the
expected construction traffic demand. The onsite security checkpoints are to be placed such
that there is no spillback onto S.R. 11. There are some construction lay down areas east or
south of S.R. 11, but these do not affect the impacts described herein.

In the "Future Build" condition, with the new Bell Bend plant operational, all traffic impacts can
be mitigated simply by signal optimization.

The details and cost of decommissioning mitigation measures applied for the construction phase
are not shown in this document. It may be that PennDOT would choose to leave some of these
in place.

BELL BEND NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
TRAFFIC SCOPING MEETING APPLICATION
BNP-2010-013

References:       1)    Bell Bend Nuclear Power Plant Traffic Impact Study


As you are probably aware, PPL Nuclear Development LLC is proposing to build a new nuclear
power plant (BBNPP) near the existing Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES) in Berwick,
PA. The federal application process is ongoing and as part of it initial meetings with PennDOT
District 4-0 and 3-0 were conducted in the middle of 2008.

We are now in the process of initiating state review of the traffic impact study. As a first step,
please find attached the Scoping Meeting Application for the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) related
to this proposed power plant, for your review.

Please feel free to contact myself or Vince Kelly (610.774.7611) for any questions.

We look forward to meeting with you in the near future to discuss this project.

Thank you

Respectfully,



Terry L. Harpster

 Reference:        PPL Bell Bend, LLC Letter BNP-2010-013, "Bell Bend Nuclear Power Plant
                   Traffic Scoping Meeting Application," dated January 15, 2010.

Dear Mr. Pilosi:

The purpose of this letter is to forward minutes of the February 17, 2009 TIS Scoping Meeting
for the proposed Bell Bend Nuclear Power Plant. The meeting minutes include the agenda and
attendees list. We would like to thank the staff from both district offices for their feedback and
participation. Please confirm that these minutes reflect the content of the Scoping Meeting.

The Scoping Meeting Application, forwarded on January 15, 2010, in conjunction with the
enclosed TIS Scoping Meeting minutes establish the basis for developing the TIS. We expect
to be working with Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Districts 3-0 and 4-0 closely in
the next couple of months to address items discussed at this meeting, and to proceed towards
preparing a draft TIS for your review. We estimate that we will submit a draft TIS to your office
for review and comment by the middle of May 2010.

Please contact Vince Kelly, 610.774.761 1, of our staff with any questions.

Respectfully,

  Meeting Summary

  1. An introduction t o the project and the objective for the current meeting was provided by
      Terry Harpster, Vice President of PPL Bell Bend Project Development

      Dimitri Lutchenkov of UniStar provided an overview of the licensing process vis-a-vis the
      traffic impact study (TIS)
          a. Federal application for the combined operation and licensing (COLA) have been
               filed;
           b. As part of the COLA, the Environmental Report (ER) was provided;
           c. A TIS was conducted to provide input t o the ER;
           d. As part of that process, meetings were held with PennDOT Districts 4-0 and 3-0 in
                the Spring of 2008, with representatives from Luzerne County, Columbia County,
                Berwick Borough and Salem Township attending. The project area used in the ER
              was discussed;
           e. The formal local review now being timely, the TIS Scoping Meeting Application was
              submitted in January of 2010 in the format now required. The present meeting is
               the scoping meeting.


 3. All attendees introduced themselves and identified the agencies they represented.

4. KLD provided an overview of the study area selected and assumptions in the TIS. This led t o
     a detailed discussion, with the following results:


          a. While the proposed project area is generally acceptable, PennDOT wishes t o be
               provided with a list of all signalized intersections along the principal routes
               approaching the site that have a peak hour flow increase of 100 vph (vehicle per
               hour) or more due to the proposed project, with an assessment of whether or not
              these intersections should be included in the project area. The assessment can be
              that inclusion in the project area is recommended, or that while the volume does
               increase, there is a rationale for not including the specific intersection. PennDOT
               will review the assessment, and concur or provide feedback.
          b. The trip generation rates were acceptable t o PennDOT. A written description o f
               how they were obtained, including other places they were used, was requested.
              This will be included in the TIS.
          c. The average vehicle occupancy of 1.30 for the construction workforce was
               acceptable to PennDOT. A written description of how it was obtained, including
               other places the number was used, was requested. This will be included in the TIS.


     These three items will be provided t o PennDOT within two weeks.              PennDOT review is
     needed on only item "a".


5. Further information on the KLD presentation includes the following:

          a. Site Access:
                    i. The issue of the single entrylpoint of access was discussed. The current plan
                        involves a single point of access for the construction work force at Bell Bend
                        due t o security reasons. All workers have t o access the site through a single
                        check point. The proposed site access intersection along RT11, south of the
                        existing intersection for the existing SSES (Susquehanna Steam Electric
                        Station) will serve as the single point of entry and will be used in the traffic
                        assignment.
                   ii. PennDOT asserted that the permit covering the existing SSES entrance has
                        been revoked, because the work defined in the permit was never completed.
                        PPL will pursue with PennDOT and resolve separate from the Bell Bend TIS.


          b. Trip Generation during construction
                    i. Construction Staff

 02117110 TIS Scoping Meeting                                                Meeting Minutes


                              PennDOT requested clarification on the arrival and departure
                              patterns during the shift change. KLD stated that there is no overlap
                              in the shift times. Based on discussions with construction contractors
                              at similar sites, the arriving traffic was loaded in the hour preceding
                              the start of shift and departing traffic was loaded in the hour
                              following the end of shift. This results in no overlap of traffic on the
                              highway network. The TIS will clearly state the following:
                                 a. The actual breakdown of traffic during these hours in 15-min
                                      increments for arrivals and departures at shift change;
                                  b. The peak hour for analysis, based on the highest set of four
                                      consecutive 15-min intervals during this 2-hour period of
                                      arrivals and departures.
                    ii. New Plant Staff
                              KLD explained that the trip generation rates are based on the
                              estimated number of new employees at Bell Bend (363) distributed
                              over the day based on actual traffic counts collected at the SSES
                              entrance.
                   iii. Outage Staff
                           1. KLD explained that using the estimated maximum number of
                              additional workers expected on site during an outage at SSES, and
                             traffic counts at the site entrance, the trip generation was estimated
                             for the outage staff.
                          2. It was added that the outage was an annual event lasting a month.
                              The TIS was using the outage month that was coincident with the
                              duration of peak construction activity for the analysis t o determine
                              maximum impacts.
                   iv. Heavy Vehicles
                          1. KLD stated that based on discussions with the construction contractor
                              it was determined that the heavy vehicle shipments would arrive
                              round the clock on site.    Given the duration of construction (5-7
                              years), this would result in a small hourly flow. PennDOT requested
                              the documentation of this be included in the TIS.
                          2. KLD stated that the "heavy-heavy" shipments were expected t o be
                              arriving on site by rail. Also, the planned payload per truck was 15-
                              tons, which would fit on regular tractor-trailers. PennDOT mentioned
                              that along RT 11there is a section north of the site (and south of 1-81)
                              that has a weight restriction due to a bridge and would need to be
                              taken into account in the analysis. KLD noted that if the weight

                                restriction were an issue, the trucks use 1-80 and RT-11 and the TIS
                                would reflect that.
           c. Trip Generation during Operation
                        New Plant Staff: This was presented as the basis for the analysis of the
                        Future Build condition, when the plant would be operational.
           d. Trip Distribution and Assignment
                        KLD provided an overview of the main routes into the site.           Using these
                        routes and the separate estimates of the population centers/sources the
                        trips were assigned for the TIS
                            1. Construction workers:         Using Census data, the main population
                                centers were identified and were spatially loaded on the main routes.
                                This resulted in approximately an even split for traffic entering the
                                site at the new intersection from both north and south on RT 11;
                            2. Operations and Outage workers: Using the employee zip codes at
                                SSES, the spatial assignment was performed;
                           3. Heavy Vehicles: These were loaded onto RT 11from 1-80 and the
                                alternate route from RT 93 through Nescopeck was not used.
                                PennDOT did raise the issue of lane widths on RT11through Berwick.
                                Given the assumption that the oversize loads were being brought on
                                site through rail, and tractor trailers currently use these sections of RT
                                11, it was considered to be not an issue.
           e. Study Area
                        Refer to Item 4.a.
           f.   Analysis tool
                        The software product SYNCHRO (version 7) was identified as the analysis tool
                        for the TIS
           g. Analysis periods
                        KLD presented the typical periods that would be analyzed in the TIS
                            1. Existing Condition, 2010
                           2. Future No Build Condition (If Bell Bend were not built)
                           3. Future Build Condition (the first year when Bell Bend is operational) -
                                Future Year Construction
                                The month coincident with an outage at SSES and the duration of
                                peak construction activity in the 5 t o 7 year construction period


           h. Growth rates
                        KLD provided the latest growth rates as published by PennDOT (July 2009 t o
                        July 2010). These will be used in the TIS submittal.

           i.   Municipal and Other Local Involvement
                   i. The question arose as t o how local government assures that it is involved in
                           the process. PennDOT pointed out that a signoff is required by the local
                           jurisdiction when a HOP for a new signal is issued. The local jurisdiction can
                           also make formal written application to PennDOT for involvement.
                        ii. It was suggested that early outreach be done to all possible affected local
                           jurisdictions, to elicit comment on the draft TIS.     This generated some
                           conversation on the risk of expanding the scope of the TIS beyond what
                           PennDOT requires as part of its review process. It was agreed that the TIS
                           will focus on the PennDOT requirements. PPL will use its standard channels
                           t o engage and communicate with and keep in touch with the various local
                           jurisdictions.
           j.   Not discussed at the meeting, but t o be included in the TIS: there are some laydown
                areas external to the site (for instance, near the rail line) that will generate some
                truck traffic in proximity to the site access road.

  Action Items

 The meeting resulted in the following action items:

      1. Finalize Study Area/lntersections for TIS, in accord with Item 4.a of "Meeting Summary".
           KLD to provide list t o PPL through standard channels for transmittal t o PennDOT, after
         touching base with PennDOT Districts 3-0 and 4-0 for initial comment.
      2. PPL will coordinate with PennDOT on the issue of the revoked permit for the existing
           plant entrance.

Hi Shawn

Attached is a list of intersections (signalized) along RT 11 and RT 93 within the extents that was discussed at the Scoping
Meeting.

I would like to chat with you about this list and get your feedback before we finalize the list and start our field data
collection.

Please let me know if there a convenient time for you today or early next week?

I am also attaching a copy of the Meeting Minutes from our Scoping Meeting in February. I believe these were mailed
earlier this week, but I am not sure of the exact date of when you will get the official copy.

Thank you

Hi Mara

Thank you for the signal file and other documents that you provided at the meeting.

We are preparing our meeting minutes and will have a copy to you shortly.

I do have a couple of quick questions/clarifications:

1. At the meeting you had provided a map that identified sections along RT 11 in Berwick that have planned roadwork
    scheduled to end in 2011. Will there be any change to roadway capacity after construction is complete?
The construction project will be a mill and resurface project from the Briar Creek Borough line to Luzerne County line
and from State Route 93 Bridge to Second Street (S.R. 11 Southbound). As a result, there will be no changes to capacity.

2. Can we get a copy of the signal file for the intersection of RT 11 (New Berwick Highway) and Market Street? The
    Market Street Bridge leads into Mifflinville
See attached. Existing field conditions will need to be field verified.

Thank you
Satya

All,

Thank you for your time yesterday morning. I am sending a summary of our discussion as we perceived it, for your own
additions and clarification.

We discussed the following items:

1. Scope of the study area

Following the Feb 17, 2010 meeting, we identified intersections (signalized) between I-80 and RT-29 (Cross Valley
Expressway) on RT 11, and on RT-93 between I-80 and RT 11. The discussion today was geared to get agreement on the
scope of the study area. District 3-0 suggested that the list presented to them was acceptable. However, Berwick
borough had requested that the un-signalized intersection at RT 11 and N Easton/S Easton Street (this intersection is
West of the intersection at RT 11 and Poplar Street) also be included in the Study area. Attached is the revised study
area that shows the intersections that will be included as part of the TIS.

District 3-0 also noted that the study area used for the construction scenario would be excessive for the Future Build
analysis given the trip generation rates. They suggested that as part of the TIS, only the intersections that will be
expected to handle 100 or more, additional trips/hour, be identified and included in the Future Build Analysis of the TIS.

We had a similar conversation with District 4-0 on April 7, 2010. They agreed to the scope of the study area as
presented, within their District.

2. Historical Data

The availability of historical data in the study area was discussed. Apparently there was a recent traffic study completed
at the intersection of RT 11 and Briar Creek Plaza. District 3-0 will provide the contact information of the traffic
engineering firm that conducted the study. This is the only recent data available within the study area in District 3-0.

3. TIS Review ­ Coordination with PennDOT District 4-0

The possibilities related to a coordinated review of the TIS between District 3-0 and District 4-0 was discussed because
the study area included intersections in both districts. District 3-0 stated that they preferred an independent review of
the TIS and proposed mitigations in their district. It was agreed that the TIS would be submitted to both districts and
comments provided separately. Each District would comment on the relevant mitigation in their respective districts.

Agreement to the assumptions embedded in the TIS (trip generation and distribution) between both districts was also
discussed. District 3-0 mentioned that they would like to see the underlying premise for the assumptions; this is in
accord with the agreement reached at the scoping meeting and reflected in those minutes. KLD noted that the trip
generation was based on a combination of similar traffic studies and discussions with constructions contractors/utilities.
The trip distribution for the operations workforce will be based on existing employee data at SSES (Susquehanna Steam


                                                                 1

                                          Controlled Document
Electric Station), and trip distribution for construction workforce will be based on the census data. These assumptions
would be noted in the TIS.

District 3-0 requested a timeline for the submission of the draft TIS. KLD responded that the field data collection is
planned in the coming weeks and a draft TIS should be ready for PennDOT review in middle of May 2010.

4. Other Items

-   District 3-0 wanted clarification with regard to the design of the planned site access driveway. Specifically the right
    turns out of the site onto RT 11 (heading towards Berwick). KLD stated that currently, there is an acceleration lane
    being planned for the right turns out of the site that would be allowed to make right turns on red. District 3-0
    suggested that the RTOR (right turn on red) be prohibited. This was to ensure that the vehicles waiting to make a
    right turn would be queued up on site, rather than on RT 11 heading towards Berwick. Given the volumes expected
    to be travelling RT 11 through Berwick, this was suggested as a mitigation measure to alleviate congestion in
    downtown Berwick.

-   The material shipments arriving on site were also discussed. KLD clarified that there will be concrete and other
    material arriving on site by road and the heavy equipment by rail. District 3-0 requested that the details be provided
    in the TIS. Agreed.

5. Data Requests

    a) From District 3-0: Information of the traffic engineering firm that performed the traffic study at the intersection
       of Briar Creek Plaza and RT 11

Kindly let us know if you have any questions or comments.

Thank you

All,

Thank you for your time on Wednesday, April 7, 2010 to discuss the TIS for the proposed expansion at the PPL site in
Berwick, PA. I am sending a summary of our discussion as we perceived it, for your own additions and clarification.

We discussed the following items:

1. Scope of the study area

Following the Feb 17, 2010 meeting, we identified intersections (signalized) between I-80 and RT-29 (Cross Valley
Expressway) on RT 11, and on RT-93 between I-80 and RT 11. The discussion was geared to get agreement on the scope
of the study area. District 4-0 indicated that the list presented to them was acceptable.

We had a similar conversation with District 3-0 yesterday. They recommended adding one more intersection in Berwick
to the study area. Please find attached the revised study area.

District 3-0 also noted that the study area used for the construction scenario would be excessive for the Future Build
analysis given the trip generation rates. They suggested that as part of the TIS, only the intersections that will be
expected to handle 100 or more, additional trips/hour, be identified and included in the Future Build Analysis of the TIS.

2. Historical Data

The availability of historical data in the study area was discussed. The intersection of RT 29 and RT 11 in Nanticoke is
currently being upgraded from a stop-sign to a signalized intersection. District 4-0 agreed to provide the condition
diagrams for this intersection and the traffic data (turn movements) associated with the signal warrant analysis. This is
the only recent data available within the study area in District 4-0.

3. TIS Review ­ Coordination with PennDOT District 3-0

The possibilities related to a coordinated review of the TIS between District 3-0 and District 4-0 was discussed because
the study area included intersections in both districts. District 4-0 suggested that we submit copies of the TIS to both
districts and District 4-0 can internally coordinate and provide a combined set of comments.

Based on our conversations with District 3-0 yesterday, they stated that they preferred an independent review of the TIS
and proposed mitigations in their district. They suggested that the TIS be submitted to both districts and comments
provided separately. Each District would comment on the relevant mitigation in their respective districts.

Based on the above, it appears that we will adopt the following approach:
   - Provide the Draft TIS to both districts for review simultaneously
   - Receive comments separately from each district
   - Provide responses to comments from both districts and submit the revised TIS to both districts
                                                                 1

                                          Controlled Document

4. Other Items

At the Feb 17 2010 meeting the possible tolling of I-80 was identified as an external impact to the study. District 4-0
stated that I-80 tolling project had been recently rejected by FHWA and hence does not have to be considered as part of
the analysis.

5. Data Requests

   a) From District 4-0: Traffic data (turning movement data) at the proposed signal on RT 11 and RT 29/Mills Street in
      Nanticoke
   b) From District 4-0: Condition Diagrams for the intersections in Nanticoke:
         1. Proposed signal at RT 11 and RT 29/Mills St in Nanticoke
         2. Signal at RT 11/E Poplar Avenue and Broadway/Nanticoke Bridge
   c) From District 4-0: Condition Diagrams for the intersections in Nescopeck:
         1. Signal at RT 93/3rd Street and RT 339/Broad Street
         2. Signal at RT 93/3rd Street and Dewey Street

Mara started off the conversation with the three items to be discussed.
Item 1: Is the study area sufficient as provided in the e-mail dated March
26, 2010 to Shawn Stille?

Item 2: Is there any recent traffic count data the district can provide?

Item 3: How are the two districts going to coordinate the transportation
impact study (TIS) review?

    1. The study area provided in the March e-mail is sufficient to PennDOT
       district 3 for the construction analysis phase. After having discussions
       with Berwick Boro they would like to include the unsignalized
       intersection of S.R. 11 (Front Street) and Eaton Street.
       For the permanent build condition the study area may be reduced,
       only including intersections affected by 100 additional vehicles or
       more. This may greatly reduce the size of the study area. Satya will
       justify the study area for build condition in the TIS.
    2. A Transportation Impact Analysis was just completed and included the
       intersection of S.R. 11 and Briar Creek Plaza in Briar Creek Township.
       Gerald will forward the HOP engineer's contact information for count
       data. No other intersections within this study area have recent data.
    3. KLD will simultaneously submit the TIS to both districts. District 3 will
       compile comments and submit directly to KLD. District 4 will be the
       lead in approving the TIS once both agencies are satisfied.

Other Questions:

    1. How will concrete, gravel, sand, rebar and such be shipped to the site,
       since there will be an on-site concrete plant?

       The heavy heavy material will be shipped via the railroad. All other
       material such as the concrete material will be shipped in with trucks.
       Approximately 1.5 trucks per hour around the clock. All trucks will be
       15 tons or less.
       Note: District 4 stated at the February meeting that there are bridges
       leading up to the site that have a 10 ton weight restriction. These
       restrictions could increase the amount of truck percentage in District
       3.
    2. Alan asked how the right turning vehicles from the site will be
       controlled while entering onto S.R. 11.
       Satya stated that the right turn traffic will be turning into their own
       lane on S.R. 11. Alan pointed out the concern of this traffic
       overwhelming the system on S.R. 11 in Berwick considering no
       dispersion points are between the access and Berwick. Alan suggested
       that this intersection be modeled two different ways. One way showing
       the right turn traffic free flowing into their own lane on S.R. 11. The
       other way would show the right turn traffic being controlled by the
       signal. This second proposal will introduce metering of traffic into
       Berwick.

    3. Alan asked when the TIS is proposed to be submitted. Satya stated
       that the TIS should be submitted in May.

Mara concluded stating that Shawn Stille will be the main contact regarding
the TIS.

All correspondence should be routed through Gerald Wertz.

    Appendix E

    This appendix contains all supporting worksheets and materials relating to
    capacity analysis for the existing conditions. Table E-1 summarizes the LOS and
    delay at each intersection. Stick diagrams depicting the volumes used as inputs
    for the capacity analysis are provided in Figures E-1 and E-2. Synchro HCM
    signalized reports are given to support calculations at signalized intersections and
    HCS+ reports are given for all unsignalized intersections.

    Queue storage calculations employing the PennDOT method are provided.
    The volumes shown in these worksheets are PCE (Passenger Car
    Equivalent) volumes which are factored up to account for the presence of
    heavy vehicles. The maximum hourly left turn volumes were used to
    determine the necessary storage.

   Appendix G

   This appendix contains all supporting worksheets and materials relating to
   capacity analysis for the future no-build conditions. Table G-1 summarizes the
   LOS and delay at each intersection. Stick diagrams depicting the volumes used as
   inputs for the capacity analysis are provided in Figures G-1 and G-2. HCM
   signalized reports are given to support calculations at signalized intersections and
   HCS+ reports are given for all unsignalized intersections.

   Queue storage calculations employing the PennDOT method are provided. The
   volumes shown in these worksheets are PCE (Passenger Car Equivalent) volumes
   which are factored up to account for the presence of heavy vehicles. The
   maximum hourly left turn volumes were used to determine the necessary storage.

APPENDIX H ­ TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT

The traffic expected to arrive/depart on site is assigned to the study area intersections based on
the spatial location of the trip origins/destinations. The region surrounding the site is divided
into 8 directional sectors relative to the site: (North, North East, East, South East, South, South
West, West and North West). For each of these directions, potential routes are identified and
traffic is then assigned to the study area intersections based on their locations along these
potential routes. The following section defines these routes and the resulting assignment.

Site Location and Access Routes

Based on the site location the major access routes to the site from different directions would be
the following:

Spatial Distribution of the Construction Work Force

The construction workforce is estimated to be drawn from the major population centers around
the site. Using the census data within 40 miles as a starting point, the spatial distribution of the
population into 8 directions was identified as shown in Table H-2.

                    Table H-2 Spatial Distribution of Census Block Population

It appears from Table H-2 that most of the traffic will come from the North East (NE) and South
East (SE) directions. These correspond to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton region and Hazleton areas
respectively. Using Table H-2 and the available routes, the construction and heavy vehicle
traffic leaving the site and arriving on site, is assigned as shown in Figure H-2.

Spatial Distribution of the Operations/Outage Work Force

Using the employee zip codes the spatial distribution of the workers on site is shown in Table H-
3. As shown in Table H-3, most of the current operations workforce is drawn from the west
(Berwick). Using this distribution and the available routes, the operations traffic leaving the site
is assigned as shown in Figure H-3. The same distribution is applied for the outage workforce.

    Appendix I

    This appendix contains all supporting worksheets and materials relating to
    capacity analysis for the Future Build scenario. Table I-1 summarizes the LOS
    and delay at each intersection. Stick diagrams depicting the volumes used as
    inputs are again provided. Synchro HCM signalized reports are given to support
    calculations at signalized intersections and HCS+ reports are given for all
    unsignalized intersections.

    Queue storage calculations employing the PennDOT method are provided.
    The volumes shown in these worksheets are PCE (Passenger Car
    Equivalent) volumes which are factored up to account for the presence of
    heavy vehicles. The maximum hourly left turn volumes were used to
    determine the necessary storage.

    Appendix L

    This appendix contains all supporting worksheets and materials relating to
    capacity analysis for the Future Build scenario. Table L-1 summarizes the LOS
    and delay at each intersection. Stick diagrams depicting the volumes used as
    inputs are again provided. Synchro HCM signalized reports are given to support
    calculations at signalized intersections and HCS+ reports are given for all
    unsignalized intersections.

    Queue storage calculations employing the PennDOT method are provided.
    The volumes shown in these worksheets are PCE (Passenger Car
    Equivalent) volumes which are factored up to account for the presence of
    heavy vehicles. The maximum hourly left turn volumes were used to
    determine the necessary storage.

    15 Minute Volume Adjustment for HCM Analysis During Construction
    Phase PM Peak

    Two considerations in determining the applicable peak hour factor were considered:
       1) Based upon available data, the PM peak hour is estimated to occur at 3:45pm to
          4:45pm;

          2) At the same time, there is a rigid boundary within this period, namely the start of
             a new shift at 4:00pm. The time preceding this is characterized by arrival flow
             (for the next shift), on certain approaches; the time following this is
             characterized by departure flow (from the earlier shift), on different
             approaches1.

    To model this realistically, the flow was modeled by sequential 15-min periods, in both
    Synchro and SIMTraffic. This is consistent with the strong HCM guidance to benefit
    from local data when available. Refer to Table M-3, which shows the sequence of 15-
    minute flows and the very substantial shift from inbound (i.e. NB, SB) to outbound (i.e.
    EB) at the shift boundary. Table M-4 shows the busiest 15-min from each pattern
    expressed in terms of hourly flow rates.

      This is analogous to arrival/departures at a Church parking lot on a Sunday morning, when there are 
    closely spaced consecutive services.  Attention focuses on arrivals, and then switches quickly to focus on 
    departures (from the earlier service), taking into account passby traffic in both cases.

    This method was applied to all of the calculations for the PM construction phase peak
    throughout this appendix and is reflected in the LOS/delay calculations regarding the
    construction phase peak with mitigation presented throughout this report.


    Additionally, this peak hour was analyzed using SimTraffic with the four individual 15
    minute volumes for each approach. This traffic visualization in SimTraffic was used to
    aid in the analysis of traffic operations with mitigation, and in the development of
    appropriate signal timings.

MUTCD TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS AT FOUR PRESENTLY
UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

This appendix contains the analysis of four intersections,

    ¾    Bell Bend Site Entrance & S.R. 11 (Front Street)
    ¾    Eaton Street & S.R. 11 (Front Street)
    ¾    SSES Site Entrance & S.R. 11 (Front Street)
    ¾    S.R. 29 & S.R. 11 (East Poplar Street)

The data used in support of this analysis, in particular the hourly traffic volumes for the
existing, future no-build, future build and construction future cases is detailed in the
text of this report. For all intersections, with the exception of Eaton Street & S.R. 11
(Front Street) Warrant Two (Four Hour) or Warrant Three (Peak Hour) are satisfied.

Warrant One is not considered given that eight hours of traffic volumes are not
available. Warrants Four through Eight are not considered for all intersection due to
lack of data or the fact that they are not applicable.

Bell Bend Site Entrance & S.R. 11 (Front Street)

Refer to Figure M-5 which shows the traffic volumes for the existing, future build and
construction cases. No data exist for the future no-build case as this intersection does
not exist for that case. The 70% Factor is applied at this intersection given that the
speed limit is greater than 40 MPH. Based upon the available data, no warrants are
satisfied for the existing and future build cases. In the construction case, only Warrant
3 is triggered. Given the significantly high single peak hour volume during the
construction case, a detailed engineering study to assess the installation of a temporary
traffic signal during construction is justified.

S.R. 29 & S.R. 11 (East Poplar Street)

Refer to Figure M-8 which shows the traffic volumes for the existing, future no-build,
future build and construction cases. The 70% Factor is applied at this intersection
given that the speed limit is greater than 40 MPH. Based upon the available data,
Warrant One, Warrant Two and Warrant Three are satisfied at this intersection for all
cases. As such, a detailed engineering study to asses a traffic signal installation is
justified.

Crash Rate Comparison with Statewide Averages 


Crash reports were collected for Luzerne and Columbia counties in the study area on highway segments
between and within the boroughs of Berwick and Shickshinny. The crash reports spanned 5 years from 2003-
2007. The crash statistics were converted into crash rates using AADT by route segment. This process was
repeated for sections of S.R. 11 in Berwick (Figure N-1) and sections of S.R. 11 through Shickshinny (Figure N-
2). The resulting 0.719 crashes/MVMT in Berwick and 1.233 crashes/MVMT in Shickshinny are both below the
statewide average of corresponding roads of the same-classification (State Highway Other) which average 1.29
crashes/MVMT.

Crash Diagrams

Crash statistics were compiled and mapped by location. The resulting diagrams for the Berwick area (Figure N-3)
and Shickshinny (Figure N-4) can be seen below. Analysis of the diagrams results in the following conclusions:

         1. S.R. 11 and Poplar Street has the highest share of crashes in the study are with 12 occurring over the
            past 5 years. The majority of these incidents are rear end collisions involving vehicles traveling SB on
            S.R. 11 . Poor visibility resulting from vegetation blocking this signal head in months where foliage is lush
            is a potential contributing factor.

                    ·     Recommendation: Consider trimming back and/or removing trees in the north east corner of the
                          intersection of S.R. 11 and Poplar St.

         2. One fatality occurred as a vehicle attempting to make a WB left turn from S.R. 239 was struck by a truck
            headed NB on S.R. 11. It is possible that this was partially due to the fact that the territory of vehicles
            making this WB left turn movement is not clearly defined.

                    ·     Recommendation: Consider improving lane markings and stop line delineation at the intersection
                          of S.R. 11 (S. Main Street) and S.R. 239 as is shown in the mitigated design for this intersection
                          in Figure 32 in the main body of this report.

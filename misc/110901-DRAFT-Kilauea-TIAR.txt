I.       INTRODUCTION
The proposed Klauea Lighthouse Village multi-use development is located off of Klauea Road (also
referred to as Lighthouse Road) in Klauea on the north coast of the island of Kaua`i, as shown in Figure
2. Anticipated development tenants include a grocery store, hardware store, bank, restaurants, business
offices, pharmacy and specialty retail shops. Figure 1 provides a conceptual illustration of the proposed
development. Dividing the project site is the privately owned Post Office Road (labeled By Pass Road on
the site plan) which currently serves as access to the Klauea Post Office on the western project site
border and the Klauea Plantation Center on the eastern border. This road is intended to become part of
a future "New Entry Road" or "Bypass Road", as noted in the Klauea Town Plan, to divert through
traveling traffic.

Kong Lung Historic Market Center is located across Klauea Road from the proposed development.
Klauea Plantation Center abuts County owned land consisting of a semi-circle gravel driveway, with
adjacent parking, and a grass lot in the center. Kong Lung Historic Market Center and Klauea Plantation
both consist of specialty shops and restaurants. The surrounding area includes residential single family
homes, schools, churches, a community center, a medical center and gas station with convenience
store. Approximately 1.5 miles north of the project site is the historic Klauea Lighthouse and wildlife
refuge which is a top destination and one of Kaua`i's most visited sites.

II.      EXISTING (2010) TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

A.       Roadway Configuration
Khi Highway, also identified as State Highway Route 56, is the name of the section of the two-lane
primary arterial along the east and north coasts of Kaua`i between Lhu`e and Princeville. The speed limit
along this section of road is 40 mph. Access to Klauea town, the Klauea Lighthouse, and the proposed
development is made by turning off of Khi Highway and proceeding through the following major
intersections:

1) Khi Highway and Kolo Road/Kalamania Road
2) Kolo Road and Klauea Road
3) Klauea Road and Keneke Street/Post Office Road

For the purposes of general orientation in this report, north is considered in the direction of Klauea
Lighthouse. At the intersection with Kolo Road and Kalamania Road, the eastbound and westbound
approaches of Khi Highway each have a left-turn lane and a shared through/right-turn lane. Existing
(2010) lane configurations for the major intersections are shown in Figure 3. Motorists turning right
from the westbound approach frequently were observed to utilize the shoulder to decelerate before
making the sharp turn. Motorists were also observed parking their vehicles in a turnout on the north
shoulder along Khi Highway near the gas station's food mart, as well as on the south shoulder near
the bus stop along Khi Road, rather than make the turn onto Kolo Rd and enter the parking lot.

Kalamania Road is a dead end road which provides access to several residential and agricultural
properties. The northbound approach of Kalamania Road has one lane for all turning movements. The
southbound approach of Kolo Road has a shared through/left-turn lane and a right-turn lane. Kolo Road
is generally oriented in the east-west direction, making an almost 90-degree turn to intersect with Khi
Highway. In close proximity to this intersection are several driveways and on-street parking along Kolo
Road to access the gas station, food mart, thrift shop and a church in the area.




                                                            3

Kolo Road intersects Klauea Road at a T-intersection with the Klauea Road approach being stop sign
controlled. There are pedestrian crosswalks on the north and west legs of the intersection. Each
approach has one lane shared for all movements. Although the intersection at Kolo Road and Klauea
Road is a T-intersection, there is a driveway accessing a church on the south leg of this intersection. The
speed limit along Kolo Road and Klauea Road is 25 mph. Klauea Road is oriented in the north-south
direction and is classified as a County major collector road. There are numerous residential driveways
and side streets off of Klauea Road. At the north terminus of Klauea Road is Klauea Lighthouse and
Klauea Point National Wildlife Refuge. The visiting hours to access Klauea Lighthouse are from 10am to
4pm. However, visitors are able to view the wildlife refuge area at the Klauea Point Lookout at all hours.

Klauea Road intersects Keneke Street and Post Office Road approximately 0.4 miles north of its
intersection with Kolo Road. The westbound approach is Keneke Street; the eastbound approach is Post
Office Road, which is currently a private road. This road is intended to be dedicated and eventually
become part of a future "New Entry Road" or "Bypass Road", connecting Klauea Road to Kuhio Highway
as noted in the Klauea Town Plan.

All approaches at this intersection have one lane for all traffic movements. There is a marked pedestrian
crosswalk on the north leg of the intersection. There are also driveways off Klauea Road immediately
north and south of this intersection accessing the parking area for the Kong Lung Historic Market Center,
a real estate office and the Klauea Plantation Center. When the Kong Lung parking stalls were occupied,
it was observed that customers would often park in the gravel area across Klauea Road or in the loop
driveway at the Klauea Plantation Center and walk across Klauea Road to the other market center.
Keneke Street provides access to the community center, small business shops and residential homes.
The local bus transit travels up Klauea Road and turns down Keneke Street.

B.       Volumes
Turning movement counts were taken during the AM and PM peak periods, as noted from historical
traffic counts, from 7:00­9:00am and 3:30­5:30pm on October 13, 14 and 20, 2010. The weekday AM
and PM peak hours were determined to be 7:30-8:30am and 3:30-4:30pm respectively. These counts
can be referenced in Appendix A.

Traffic volumes in this area fluctuate based on the different days of the week and months of the year as
noted from daily traffic volumes monitored along Khi Highway in 2008 by the State of Hawai`i
Department of Transportation. The 2008 historical data was used to calculate a seasonal expansion
factor for the counts taken in October 2010. Subsequently, the collected peak hour volumes were
adjusted by applying an expansion factor of 0.99. Existing (2010) adjusted peak hour traffic counts at the
intersection are shown in Figure 4.

Heavy vehicles were also classified during the counting periods. Heavy vehicles typically accelerate and
decelerate slower than passenger vehicles, requiring more time to make turning movements. They also
have larger turning radii, requiring sufficient roadway and intersection space. For these reasons, heavy
vehicles can significantly impact the operations at an intersection. Heavy vehicles observed in the
project area consisted of fuel trucks, school buses, public transit buses, delivery trucks, and passenger
vehicles with trailers.

Significant pedestrian and bicycle volumes were observed in the vicinity of the proposed project site.
Sidewalks and crosswalks exist and were utilized in most areas. North of the intersection of Klauea Road
with Keneke Street/Post Office Road, pedestrians were observed walking between parking on the west
side of Klauea Road and the Kung Long Center. Additional pedestrian and bicycle activity was observed
to and from the existing commercial buildings.

There are two bus stops along Khi Highway, east of Kolo Road near the food mart and one at the
community center off of Keneke Street. The Kaua`i's Bus transit route between Hanalei and Lhu`e runs
from 6:15am to 7:45pm, Monday through Friday and less frequently during the weekends. Two buses
usually arrive in Klauea each hour travelling in opposite directions.

C.       Operations
Level of service (LOS) is an operational analysis rating system used in traffic engineering to measure the
effectiveness of roadway operating conditions. There are six LOS ranging from A to F. LOS A is defined as
being the least interrupted flow conditions with little or no delays, whereas LOS F is defined as
conditions where extreme delays exist. Guidelines from the Hawai`i Statewide Uniform Design Manual
state that an appropriate LOS for a rural State arterial is LOS C or better. No LOS guidelines exist in
Kaua`i County Road Standards although according to AASHTO's guidelines, LOS D or better is acceptable
for rural collectors where "unusually high traffic volumes exist".

As stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), LOS for a two-way stop controlled (TWSC)
intersection is determined by the measured control delay and is defined for each minor movement, not
for the intersection as a whole. Vehicles traveling along the major, free-flow road, of a TWSC
intersection, proceed through with minimal delay, depending on the obstruction resulting from turning
vehicles. Those vehicles approaching the intersection along the minor movement (side-street) are
controlled by a stop sign and thus experience delay attributable to the volume of vehicles passing along
the free-flow road and the gaps available.

Existing (2010) LOS for each minor movement of the unsignalized intersection were determined for the
AM and PM peak hours based on the HCM methodologies and using HCS+ traffic analysis software. As
shown in Table 1, Existing (2010) conditions are operating at acceptable LOS during the AM and PM peak
hours at the Klauea Road intersections with Keneke Street/Post Office Road and with Kolo Road.
However, at the intersection of Kolo Road/Kalamania Road with Khi Highway, the northbound and
southbound approaches are operating at unacceptable LOS while the eastbound and westbound left-
turn movements are operating at acceptable LOS. Queues observed along Kolo Road, at the intersection
with Khi Highway, during the peak periods were 10 to 15 vehicles long. Future improvements

considered at the intersection, as noted through discussions with the State, include installing a traffic
signal or a roundabout; the impacts of installing a traffic signal are discussed in the Future (2013)
Without Project section. Existing (2010) analysis reports are in Appendix B.

LOS of roadway segments is determined using the peak hour bidirectional volumes and the
methodologies of the Florida Department of Transportation LOS Handbook, which is based on the
guidelines as stated in the HCM and accepted traffic engineering practice. This can be used to gauge
capacity along individual roadway segments between intersections, as specified by surrounding area and
roadway type.

According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the population of Klauea was slightly greater than 2,000. For the
purpose of determining the roadway segment LOS, Klauea is classified as a rural developed area with a
population less than 5,000. The segments of Khi Highway, between Kalihiwai Road and Kolo
Road/Kalamania Road, and Klauea Road, between Kolo Road and Keneke Street/Post Office Road, are
considered uninterrupted two-lane highways. The segment of Kolo Road between Khi Highway and
Klauea Road is approximately 450 feet long which is considered insufficient length to produce accurate
results and thus was not included in this analysis. The following table provides the Existing (2010)
roadway segmental LOS along Khi Highway and Klauea Road using the peak hour two-way volumes.
Both roadway segments are currently operating at acceptable LOS. Roadway segmental analysis for
Khi Highway and Klauea Road are provided in Appendix C.

III.     FUTURE (2013) WITHOUT PROJECT

A.       Roadway Configuration
Due to resident concerns about the operations at the intersection of Khi Highway and Kolo
Road/Kalamania Road, as confirmed by the poor Existing (2010) LOS, the State noted plans to improve
this with the addition of a traffic signal which has a tentative construction completion date of October
2013 but potential for completion as late as 2014. The future lane configuration analyzed at Khi
Highway and Kolo Road/Kalamania Road is as exists currently. Figure 5 provides the Future (2013)
Without Project lane configurations for the major intersections. No changes in lane configuration are
expected in the future for the intersection of Kolo Road and Klauea Road.

In association with the development of the Post Office at the end of Post Office Road, across from
Keneke Street, there are agreed upon enhancements to add left-turn lanes for the approaches of
Klauea Road. The northbound and southbound approaches at the intersection of Klauea Road and
Keneke Street/Post Office Road are planned to have a left-turn lane and a shared through/right-turn
lane. The eastbound and westbound approaches will each have one lane for all turning movements.
Although currently a private road, it is the intention of the developer of Klauea Lighthouse Village to
upgrade and dedicate Post Office Road to the County. In the Klauea Town Plan a bypass road extending
from the existing Post Office Road and connecting to Khi Highway is considered.

B.       Volumes
Operational conditions were evaluated for 2013, the year the Klauea Lighthouse Village development is
anticipated to be built out and occupied. Comparing State of Hawai`i Department of Transportation
historical data and recent traffic counts taken along Khi Highway, Kolo Road and Klauea Road, a
cumulative growth increase of 0.5% per year was determined for future conditions. Assuming growth in
this region is a product of development around the island, the annual growth rate was applied to the
existing through volumes along Khi Highway as well as movements traveling to and from Klauea
Lighthouse.

Research into future developments in the surrounding area showed no significant projects on record
with the State of Hawai`i's Office of Environmental Quality Control. The one development of note in the
vicinity of the project area, and currently under construction, is Anaina Hou which proposed to develop
a mixed-use, agricultural and recreational project with access off of Khi Highway, located about 1,700
feet northwest of the intersection with Kolo Road/Kalamania Road. Full build out of the proposed
project is anticipated in the year 2011. Projected additional vehicular volumes as a result of this
development will add minimal vehicles along Khi Highway as well as Kolo Road.

Figure 6 provides the Future (2013) Without Project peak hour volumes which were rounded to the
nearest five vehicles.

C.       Operations
As stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, LOS for a signalized intersection is determined for the
intersection as a whole. Another measure of signalized intersection delay is the volume to capacity (v/c)
ratio. This is the ratio of the volume of traffic utilizing the intersection compared to the maximum
volume of vehicles that can be accommodated by the intersection during a specific period of time. A v/c
ratio under 0.85 means the intersection is operating under capacity and excessive delays are not
experienced. An intersection is operating near its capacity when v/c ratios range from 0.85 to 0.95.
Unstable flows are expected when the v/c ratio is between 0.95 and 1. Any v/c ratio greater than or
equal to one indicates that the intersection is operating at or above capacity.

Per standard traffic engineering practice, prior to signalization of an intersection, an engineering study
of traffic conditions, pedestrian characteristics, and physical characteristics of the location shall be
performed to determine whether installation of a traffic signal is justified. The Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, 2003 Edition (MUTCD) lists eight warrants for
consideration of providing a traffic signal at an intersection. When being used for future planning
purposes, vehicular volumes are the primary warrants considered. It is also noted in the MUTCD that the
satisfaction of a traffic signal warrant or warrants does not in itself require the installation of a traffic
signal.

The intersection of Khi Highway and Kolo Road/Kalamania Road is anticipated to be signalized as part
of State DOT's planned improvements by 2013. With existing (2010) intersection conditions being
unacceptable, it can be assumed that in 2013, if not signalized, conditions will worsen. Signal warrants
from the MUTCD confirmed that a signal is necessary at this intersection in the year 2013. The signalized
intersection LOS and v/c ratio are shown in Table 3 and 4 respectively. With the addition of a traffic
signal, operations of the Future (2013) Without Project conditions are expected to improve to
acceptable LOS. The v/c ratios are less than 0.85 indicating that the intersection has sufficient capacity.
The Future (2013) Without Project unsignalized LOS for the intersections along Klauea Road are shown
in Table 5. With the slight increase in traffic volumes in 2013, the intersections will continue to operate
at acceptable LOS. Despite acceptable intersection operations, the intersection of Kolo Road and Klauea
Road pass signal warrants for 2013 volumes. The signalized and unsignalized HCS analysis reports, as
well as the signal warrants for Future (2013) Without Project conditions are located in Appendix D.

IV.      FUTURE (2013) WITH PROJECT

A.       Roadway Configuration
The main accesses to Klauea Lighthouse Village will be off of Post Office Road. A secondary entrance
driveway to the development north of Post Office Road is planned to be relocated from the existing
location across from Kong Lung Market Place Center driveway to a location further north off of Klauea
Road. This is due to the existing access location being located too close to the intersection with Post
Office Road, as suggested in the Kaua`i County Road Standards and ITE Traffic Engineering Handbook
that recommend a 150-foot intersection offset. This new driveway will be referred to as North Driveway
in this report.

South of Post Office Road, the existing County-owned semicircle driveway intersects Klauea Road at two
locations. As with the access north of Post Office Road, the two existing access locations are not optimal
due to their proximity to Post Office Road and Oka Street respectively. As shown in the conceptual site
plan, the southern semicircle access location is planned to connect with the proposed development as is
currently being used. To minimize impact along Klauea Road, and avoid need for additional turn-lanes,
the southern access will be analyzed as right-in/right-out. Due to the limited access at this driveway,
minimal traffic is expected to utilize this driveway thus an analysis is not necessary. The lane
configurations for Future (2013) With Project conditions are provided in Figure 7.

B.        Volumes
In determining the Future (2013) With Project volumes, project related trips were added to the Future
(2013) Without Project volumes. Project related volumes were calculated for the peak hours by using ITE
Trip Generation 8th Edition rates which are based on projected tenant land use and size of the
development. These rates are determined through numerous studies conducted to record the number
of vehicles proceeding to and from the different types of land use developments. Methodologies
described in ITE Trip Generation Handbook state that although total project trips are calculated for a
specified development, the total trips will not necessarily be new vehicles added to the adjacent
roadways. The three types of project related trips considered are pass-by trips, diverted trips and
primary trips. The definitions of each type of trips are shown in Table 7.

                                     Table 7: Project Related Trip Definitions

Type           Definition
Pass-by        Traffic currently passing the site on an adjacent street or roadway that offers direct access
               to the generator (i.e., Klauea Lighthouse Village).
Diverted       Trips that are attracted from the traffic volume on roadways within the vicinity of the
               generator but require a diversion from that roadway to another roadway to gain access to
               the site.
Primary        Trips made for the specific purpose of visiting the generator. The stop at the generator is
               the primary reason for the trip.

Pass-by project related trips were considered to be previously travelling through the intersection of
Klauea Road and Post Office Road. These pass-by trips accessing the project were rerouted from their
previous traffic route to enter the project site; when exiting the project site these vehicles continued on
their previous path to their original destination. Pass-by rates were only applied to the PM peak hour as
retail shops and other business are typically considered to open after the AM peak hour. Diverted trips
were assumed to be trips that were travelling on Khi Highway and then diverted from their original
path towards Klauea Lighthouse Village. When exiting the project, it was assumed that they will return
to Khi Highway and continue along their original travelling path. Primary trips were assumed to come
from other neighboring communities which would also add traffic along Khi Highway as well as Kolo
Road. These trips were considered to be new trips entering the study roadway network. Much of this is
due to the lack of similar type developments in the surrounding neighborhoods. Diverted and primary
trips were assumed to occur during the AM and PM peak hours. The rates used for the various types of
trips generated are shown in Table 8 for the AM and PM peak hours, as determined using similar
development studies and guidelines as stated in ITE Trip Generation Handbook.

                               Table 8: Pass-by, Diverted and Primary Trip Rates

                                           Pass-by         0          49
                                           Diverted        30         30
                                           Primary         70         21

As noted, there are two primary access locations for the project site. The main access will be off of Post
Office Road; another access will be at North Driveway. Post Office Road divides the development into
two areas north and south of Post Office Road. It was assumed that the majority of the vehicles
travelling into the area south of Post Office Road would utilize Post Office Road with a negligible volume
using the South Driveway access off of Klauea Road. For vehicles accessing the section north of Post
Office Road, based on existing and projected vehicular distribution, it was assumed that approximately
25% of vehicles would utilize North Driveway while the remaining 75% would access from Post Office
Road. The AM peak hour has a total of 174 vehicles anticipated to enter and exit the site while the PM
peak hour has 354 vehicles. This is a resulting 87 and 177 vehicles per hour respectively accessing the
development. Based on the site plans, there are approximately 200 available parking stalls being
provided on site. The tenants being planned for have high turn-over which even further lessens the
demand for parking.

Project trips were distributed along the adjacent roadways and added to the Future (2013) Without
Project traffic volumes for the resulting Future (2013) With Project traffic volumes. These volumes are
shown in Figure 8 and were used in the operational analysis for Future (2013) With Project conditions.
There is potential for lessened vehicular traffic through the use of bikes and walking because of the
close proximity of residential properties. Therefore, vehicle trips may not be as high as reported.

C.       Operations
Tables 9 and 10 provide LOS and v/c ratios for the signalized intersection of Khi Highway and Kolo
Road/Kalamania Road respectively. The signalized intersection of Khi Highway with Kolo
Road/Kalamania Road will still operate at acceptable LOS during Future (2013) With Project conditions.
With the additional traffic generated by the proposed project, this intersection will continue to operate
under capacity even with a slight increase in the v/c ratio.

The unsignalized LOS for Future (2013) With Project conditions are provided in Table 11. The
intersection of Klauea Road and Keneke Street/Post Office Road is expected to operate at acceptable
LOS, with a slight increase in delay for the eastbound and westbound approaches along Post Office Road
and Keneke Street. The southbound approach at the intersection of Kolo Road and Klauea Road will
continue to operate at acceptable LOS based on the fact that these roads are considered collector roads
and thus require a LOS D or better for acceptable conditions. As a result of the increase in project
generated traffic volumes, the southbound approach experienced additional delay in making a left-turn
due to conflicts with the high left-turning volume from the eastbound approach on Kolo Road. For the
new intersection of Klauea Road with the North Driveway, all movements are expected to operate
acceptably. Due to the acceptable operations, a separate left-turn lane along Klauea Road is not
suggested for inclusion although sufficient right-of-way exists on the east side of the existing road.
Appendix E provides the analysis reports for Future (2013) With Project conditions.

as safety concerns. With existing sidewalk and road alignment, sufficient right-of-way does not exist
along Klauea Road to add an additional turn lane for improved operations. With signal warrants passing
for Future (2013) Without Project conditions, signalization of the intersection would result in LOS C for
intersection operations and an improved LOS C for southbound PM movements. An alternative to
signalization is use of multi-way stop control which would involve the installation of stop signs for the
approaches along Kolo Road. As stated in the MUTCD, the decision to install multi-way stop control
should be based on an engineering study. For the proposed vehicular volumes, this intersection meets
the minimum requirements. Multi-way stop control is also noted to be beneficial at the intersection of
two residential neighborhood collector streets of similar design and operating characteristics which is
the case for Kolo Road and Klauea Road. As shown in Table 12, the use of multi-way stop control would
result in all approaches having LOS C or better. While this would worsen conditions along Kolo Road, it
would improve those for Klauea Road as well as improve safety.

Future (2013) With Project conditions along Khi Highway will continue to operate at acceptable LOS
as shown in Table 13. Similarly, Klauea Road will operate at acceptable LOS during both peak hours.

D.       Roundabout Alternative
By request from the County of Kaua`i, the concept of a single-lane roundabout at Klauea Road and Post
Office Road was explored as a future enhancement to the planned two-way stop controlled intersection.
As stated in FHWA's Roundabouts: An Informational Guide, roundabouts are generally safer and operate
with lower vehicle delay than other forms of intersections. Roundabouts have the added benefit of
reducing pollution and gas consumption because they facilitate uninterrupted travel through the
intersection rather than requiring a full stop, idling and acceleration from stop. Roundabouts also have
fewer conflicting points (i.e. point in which the paths of a vehicle and another vehicle, pedestrian or
bicycle cross) which increases safety for all transportation modes.

The operations of a single lane roundabout were analyzed, per standard traffic engineering practice,
based on the National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 672 ­ Roundabouts in the United
States (NCHRP Report 672) by considering conflicting flow volumes (measured in vehicles/hour) and
capacity analyses. Roundabouts follow the same delay and respective LOS rating criteria for two-way
stop controlled (TWSC) intersections, as stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. The FHWA's
Roundabouts: An Informational Guide recommends that the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for any
roundabout leg should not exceed 0.85.

Table 14 provides the anticipated LOS and v/c ratios for a single-lane roundabout at the intersection of
Klauea Road with Post Office Road utilizing Future (2013) With Project peak hour traffic volumes.
Calculations for the roundabout analysis are included in Appendix G. The use of a roundabout at this
intersection is expected to perform at desirable LOS and v/c ratios during the AM and PM peak hours.
The actual design and layout of a roundabout, and whether the existing right-of-way is adequate to
accommodate one, was not within the scope of this study.

V.       SAFETY CONCERNS
Traffic safety concerns observed along Klauea Road, Kolo Road and Khi Highway include insufficient
turning radii for larger vehicles, insufficient signage and striping at pedestrian crosswalks, speeding and
running of stop signs. This section will further discuss these safety concerns and provide suggestions to
reduce related risks for motorists, pedestrian and bicyclists. State and county agencies should be
responsible to ensure roadways are up to standard and traffic laws are enforced.

A.       Intersection Geometry
Design vehicles are a selected vehicle type that is representative of the vehicles on a roadway that can
influence or control the design and operations of roads and intersections. Design vehicles are selected
based on roadway type, surrounding area, and development type. These are often larger vehicles due to
their limited maneuverability and impact due to turning radii and off tracking. Off tracking is the
characteristic by which, at low speeds, the rear wheels of a vehicle do not follow the same path as the
front wheels. This swept path of these vehicles often dictates intersection geometry and design.

Passenger cars and trucks with trailers are the primary types of vehicles that travel through Klauea
town. Other types of vehicles observed traveling through Klauea include buses for Kaua`i's public transit
service and schools, as well as fuel and delivery trucks. There are bus stops located at the community
center within Klauea town off of Keneke Street and along Khi Highway near the gas station. Fuel
trucks were also observed to travel from Khi Highway, onto Kolo Road, and into the gas station. The
WB-50 design vehicle (semi-trailer truck), as shown in Appendix H, was chosen to represent the
proposed delivery truck that will access the Klauea Lighthouse Village development. This happens to be
the same as the fuel truck that currently accesses the gas station.




                                                           23
Klauea Lighthouse Village Traffic Impact Analysis Report - DRAFT


Delivery trucks are expected to transport goods to the grocery store and other retail stores within
Klauea Lighthouse Village, turning off of Klauea Road onto Post Office Road. An analysis was performed
using AutoTurn, a vehicle swept path turn simulation software, to ensure there is adequate turning
space for the design vehicle to navigate intersections through Klauea town. The analysis showed that
for the WB-50 design vehicle to navigate turns at the intersections there was a need to utilize adjacent
shoulders or lanes. This was apparent in the field with existing fuel trucks turning onto Kolo Road from
Khi Highway as well as busses traveling through Klauea town. Consideration should also be made for
the proposed location of the loading docks. Appendix H includes the various turning maneuvers of the
design vehicle at the intersections through Klauea.

If a future roundabout is planned for the intersection of Klauea Road and Keneke Street/Post Office
Road, consideration must be given to acceptable design to accommodate the design vehicle likely to
travel through this intersection.

B.       Crosswalk Signing and Striping
Stop lines are used at crosswalks that cross the uncontrolled approaches along Klauea Road and Kolo
Road. According to the MUTCD, "if stop lines are used at a crosswalk that crosses an uncontrolled
approach, Stop Here for Pedestrians signs shall be used" and "stop lines should be located 20 to 50 feet
in advance of the nearest crosswalk line." Thus, it is suggested to install regulatory signs at the stop lines
of crosswalks so motorists are aware of the pedestrian crossing. For the existing stop bar preceding the
crossing of Klauea Road, north of Post Office road, it is suggested to remove this so as to encourage safe
and efficient intersection operations.

C.       Traffic Calming
Residents mentioned concerns regarding speeding along Klauea Road. Police noted, as was observed in
the field, motorists failing to stop on the minor street approach at the intersection of Klauea Road and
Kolo Road, which creates a hazard to pedestrian and bicyclists. The purpose of traffic calming is to
promote safe roadway conditions through the installation of roadway features or reduction of speed for
motorists and non-motorists. A speed hump is a low-cost speed control measure which has a gradual
slope and minimal changes in height as compared to speed bumps. The implementation of speed humps
could slow traffic along Klauea Road. Another possibility would be to consider raised pedestrian
crosswalks which both control vehicle speed as well as bringing attention to crossing pedestrians. As is
considered at the intersection of Klauea Road and Keneke Street/Post Office Road, roundabouts serve
as a way to slow vehicular traffic as well. A few strategies to encourage motorists to come to a full stop
at stop signs include enhancing signage and delineation, provide a wider stop bar, install rumble strips,
or providing pavement marking with "Stop Ahead" message. Ultimately, the only way to ensure these
measures are adhered to is through continued law enforcement by police.

VI.      SUMMARY
Upon project completion and build-out, traffic generated from Klauea Lighthouse Village is expected to
have limited impact on the roadway network in and around Klauea. The existing road and intersection
operations along Klauea Road operate at acceptable LOS. The existing intersection at Khi Highway
with Kolo Road/Kalamania Road operates at poor LOS and warrants a traffic signal, of which
construction has been planned by the State. Klauea Road has left-turn lanes planned at the intersection
of Post Office Road/Keneke Street as part of the Klauea Lighthouse Village development in future
(2013). With these planned changes, Future (2013) With Project intersections and roadways are
anticipated to operate at acceptable LOS.

The project-related volumes traveling through the intersection of Klauea Road with Kolo Road are
anticipated to have a higher delay due to the conflicts with the left-turning movement from the minor
street and major streets although still operate at acceptable LOS conditions. Sufficient right-of-way does
not exist along Klauea Road at this location to add an additional turn lane. As an alternative to
signalization, it is suggested to consider installation of multi-way stop control for the intersection to
ease left-turning movement delays.

A future roundabout at Klauea Road and Post Office Road was considered for Future (2013) With
Project conditions. Beyond the conclusion that it would further reduce delay and potentially increase
safety, further consideration of this enhancement was not within the scope of this report.

Safety concerns analyzed included intersection geometry, signing and striping, and speeding. The
analysis of design vehicle ability to navigate intersection geometry resulted in the need to utilize
adjacent shoulders and lanes. Existing vehicles were observed to utilize similar methods to complete
these turn movements and thus it is recommended that delivery vehicles use caution in accessing the
development. It is also recommended to consider the addition of traffic calming measures, like speed
humps or raised pedestrian crosswalks, along Klauea Road to discourage speeding, as well as provide
additional signage to notify motorists of approaching stop signs or crosswalks.

A future "New Entry Road" or "Bypass Road" noted in the Klauea Town Plan is currently conceptual in
nature and therefore its contributory effects were not considered in the Future (2013) conditions of the
roadway network. The intent of this road is to divert through-traveling vehicles thus reducing delay
along existing Klo Road and Klauea Road. An update to this TIAR addressing the potential construction
of the "New Entry Road" is included in a memo in Appendix I.

SUBJECT:        Klauea Lighthouse Village TIAR Update - New Town Entry Road

It was requested by the County of Kaua`i Department of Public Works to provide an update to the
Klauea Lighthouse Village Traffic Impact Analysis Report (KLV TIAR) that addressed the potential future
construction of the New Town Entry Road for the town of Klauea, Kaua`i. As noted in the September
2005 Klauea Town Plan, An Update of the Klauea Sub-Area Plan, the New Town Entry Road was
recommended to divert traffic away from residential neighborhoods, improve access for through-
traveling traffic, provide town residents with a more convenient route to and from the highway, and
improve safety. The recommended alignment of the New Town Entry Road is as provided in the
circulation plan for the existing and future expansion of Klauea Town below.

                                                                                                  Page 2

                                                                                                   8/31/11



The existing KLV TIAR analyzed roadway/intersection conditions in the study area for a future "worst-
case" scenario in which the proposed KLV development is built-out although the New Town Entry Road
does not exist. The results of the KLV TIAR analysis provide suggested mitigation at the study
intersections to alleviate impact due to the resulting increase in traffic. With construction of the New
Town Entry Road, those impacts will be lessened and ultimately study roadway/intersection operations
improved.

The existing access to the commercial center of Klauea Town as well as the Klauea National Wildlife
Refuge and Klauea Lighthouse, comes off of Khi Highway at Kolo Road and primarily along Klauea
Road. As noted in the KLV TIAR, the existing functional classification of Klauea Road is a County major
collector road. It is assumed that the proposed New Town Entry Road would also be classified as a
collector, with specific major/minor status to be studied in a forthcoming functional classification report.
The New Entry Road is being proposed to provide an extension of the existing private Post Office Road.
Currently, Post Office Road is planned for dedication to the County with a local road functional
classification. With the connection of New Entry Road, the classification of Post Office Road would also
achieve collector road status.

Traffic operations along the New Town Entry Road would ultimately be studied in a separate TIAR
completed for the roadway. This TIAR would provide traffic forecasting in addition to intersection and
roadway analysis and determination of mitigation needs. With the increase in traffic along Post Office
Road, intersections with driveways and Klauea Road will need to consider mitigation such as inclusion of
left-turn lanes to improve operations and safety, which are not currently being suggested in the KLV
TIAR.

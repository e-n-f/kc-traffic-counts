Executive Summary 

This transportation plan has been prepared as part of the larger community planning
effort conducted for the Brookings area. It has been conducted under the supervision and
funding of the South Dakota Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway
Administration, with cooperation and participation of the City of Brookings, Brookings
County and the City of Aurora. It uses the general transportation goals and objectives
identified in the Brookings comprehensive plan and reflects other state and local planning
studies. The plan is comprised of the following components:

Current conditions assessment

Data were gathered concerning current traffic volumes, traffic origins and destinations,
crashes, and public perceptions regarding the transportation system. The data were
analyzed to determine where improvements may be needed. Public perceptions were
measured using survey instruments, including an extensive online survey. Some key
findings of the surveys were:
·     The primary mode of transportation in the Brookings area is the passenger car, with
      a large majority indicating that they drive to work, school or other activities. Other
      significant modes include carpools, walking, biking, motorcycles, transit, and taxis.
·     The public views the safety of the transportation system favorably, with about 66%
      rating it adequate, good, or excellent.
·     About 73% rated congestion as a minor or non-existent problem.
·     When asked to allocate a hypothetical $100 for transportation improvements,
      survey respondents assigned the most to maintaining and improving existing roads
      and streets, followed by investments in new roads and streets, existing rural roads,
      and transit.
·     About 45% responded that the proportion of taxes directed to transportation should
      be increased slightly.
·     Over 60% expressed support for a slight increase in taxes to improve roads and
      streets.

Future conditions assessment

A traffic forecasting model was built and traffic volumes were forecast for 2020 and
2035. Traffic operations were analyzed to determine future transportation needs. The
transportation needs were assembled into a list of potential projects.

Public involvement

The public was involved in the planning process through the survey instruments, a
website, a FacebookTM page, and public meetings. Public input was sought on
transportation needs early in the process and on the list of potential transportation
projects later in the study.

Prepare design standards and other support documents

Current regulations and guidance for design of transportation improvements were
reviewed and updated documents were provided for consideration.

Prepare project program and study document

The final project program was prepared based on input from the public, elected officials,
transportation professionals, and the Study Team. The study process was documented in
this report. The project program can be found in Figure 34.

Goals and Objectives 

This Master Transportation Plan for the Brookings Area exists within the larger
framework of comprehensive community planning that has been undertaken by the City
of Brookings and other local governments. The City of Brookings has evaluated growth
trends and community desires to create a statement of the planned community vision
contained in Vision 2020, the most recent comprehensive plan.

Strategies for implementing the community's transportation vision are contained in the
goals and objectives stated in the Vision 2020 report and reproduced below:

Transportation Goal: Develop and maintain a comprehensive transportation system that
meets the current and future needs of Brookings.

Transportation Objectives:
   · Encourage an energy efficient system that provides adequate access to high
      volume traffic generation points.
   · Minimize negative transportation effects upon residential neighborhoods.
   · Promote efficient traffic flows around residential institutional uses such as
      schools, churches and major public recreation areas.
   · Promote the installation of sidewalks and trails to facilitate safe travel for
      pedestrians and bicyclists.

The goal and objectives are further detailed through the statement of the following
transportation policies:
    · Prevent through traffic on local streets within established neighborhoods.
    · Create and maintain a grid system of major streets throughout the City.
    · Require direct pedestrian and bicycle access from residential neighborhoods to
       schools, commercial centers and recreation areas.
    · Separate vehicular traffic from pedestrian and bicycle traffic wherever possible
       through the use of sidewalks and recreational trails.
    · Design residential street layouts to minimize both overall street lengths and the
       quantity of site grading required.
    · Limit driveway entrances on arterial streets and collector streets wherever
       possible.
    · Require continuity of collector streets between adjacent subdivisions.
    · Secure sufficient rights-of-way to accommodate the City's major street plan.

The guidance provided by these statements of community vision has been used
throughout the preparation of this transportation plan.

Procedures 
 
Preparation of this transportation plan followed a dual-track process. As shown in Figure
1, assembly and analysis of data provided input to the evaluation of existing and future
conditions. The end result of the data and evaluation tracks was a program of future
transportation improvements.




                                          FIGURE 1 ­ STUDY WORK FLOW

The study data was assembled from existing databases and from counts and surveys
conducted by the project team in 2010. Roadway capacity analysis was conducted using
Highway Capacity Manual techniques via Trafficware® SYNCHRO software. A new
regional travel demand model was prepared to facilitate traffic forecasts.

Existing Conditions 

A useful transportation planning effort begins with a comprehensive inventory of the
existing transportation system. That inventory needs to include not just technical data,
but also public perceptions of the existing transportation system. Therefore, the study
proceeded with data gathering on two fronts: 1) assembly of technical information from
traffic counts, origin/destination surveys, and database searches, and 2) survey of the
public perception of existing transportation system needs.

Transportation System Needs

A list of potential transportation system needs was generated through a multi-pronged
input effort, including:
    · Input from the project Study Team, comprised of State and Local transportation
        officials.
    · Input from the public via written and spoken comments at the first public meeting.
    · Input from the public via an online survey instrument.
    · Input from the public via email and Facebook comments.
The input comments were assembled on Figures 3 ­ 8, reproduced on the following
pages. They indicate that the primary areas of concern are related to the growing
congestion in the City's commercial areas, the crossings of Interstate 29 and roadways
providing access to the Industrial Park. Other comments target the SDSU campus area
and other isolated areas of concern.

The online survey instrument asked many qualitative questions about the perception of
the Brookings-area transportation system, but also went further to evaluate the public's
assessment of the most important transportation issues in the Brookings area. Figure 2
shows the relative composite rankings of those issues. A more detailed summary of the
survey results is contained in the Public Involvement section of this report.

Functional Classification

A well-functioning transportation system depends on having streets serving all the types
of transportation needs, from local access and circulation streets to Interstate highways.
The existing Brookings-area roadway system provides the full compliment of streets and
highways, with each street section classified according to its planned function.

The existing functional classification of the street system is shown in the current Major
Streets Plan, Figure 9. It should be noted that the functional classification system
maintained by local government may differ slightly from the Federal functional
classification maintained by SDDOT due to mileage limitations on certain types of
roadways.

Traffic Counts

Vehicular turning movement counts were conducted to supplement existing traffic
volume databases. Turning movement counts were performed as follows:

   · US 14 bypass/Medary Ave. ­ 6:30 AM ­ 6:30 PM
   · 8th St. S./Main Ave. ­ 6:30 AM ­ 6:30 PM
   · US 14 bypass/Western Ave. ­ 7 AM ­ 11 AM, 2 PM ­ 6 PM

External Travel
Origin/destination studies were conducted from September through October, 2010 to
provide background data for the planning study and a basis for determining the amount of
traffic

traveling completely through the study area. The origin/destination studies were
conducted using a postcard survey method ­ postcards with survey questions were
distributed to drivers as they entered the study area. The estimated daily trips between
external stations are shown in Figure 10.

Volumes and Level of Service

Daily traffic volumes are shown on Figure 11 ­ 2010 Traffic Counts. Figure 11 also
displays the links in the existing street network that have reached Level of Service "C" or
worse.

Observations of traffic volumes provide an understanding of the general nature of traffic,
but are insufficient to indicate either the ability of the street network to carry additional
traffic or the quality of service provided by the street system. For this reason the concept
of level of service (LOS) was developed to correlate numerical traffic operational data to
subjective descriptions of traffic performance at intersections. Each lane of traffic has
delay associated with it and therefore a correlating LOS. The weighted average delay for
each of these lanes of traffic for a signalized intersection is the intersection LOS. LOS
categories range from LOS "A" (best) to "F" (worst).

The levels of service on roadway network links were determined by using tables
developed by the Florida Department of Transportation for general planning-level
assessment. The Florida tables are based on procedures developed for the Highway
Capacity Manual and provide a quick way of estimating roadway level of service. They
have become widely used across the country for planning purposes.

The level of service analysis indicates that several roadways have reached LOS C ­ the
point where these roadway sections should be monitored for any further deterioration in
service. Those roadways sections include:
    · US 14B ­ from US 14 junction west of Brookings to Medary Avenue
    · 11th Street (N) ­ from 16th Avenue to 22nd Avenue
    · 8th Street (N) ­ from Medary Avenue to 16th Avenue
    · 6th Street (N) ­ from Main Avenue to 32nd Avenue
    · 8th Street South ­ from Main Avenue to 22nd Avenue
    · Medary Avenue ­ from Campus Drive to 8th Street South
    · 17th Avenue ­ from Orchard Drive to 8th Street South
    · 22nd Avenue ­ from 11th Street (N) to 8th Street South

Intersections may also be analyzed to determine their level of service. The level of
service for each of the major intersections in the Brookings street system is shown in
Figure 12. While a number of stop-sign controlled intersection approaches have existing
levels of service of "D" or worse, this is fairly common on side-street approaches to
arterial roadways. There is one intersection, however, where current operations need
attention ­ the intersection of 6th Street and 22nd Avenue operates at LOS "E" in the P.M.
peak hour.

Safety

The safety of the current Brookings transportation system was evaluated through review
of crash location data, public comments and previous reports provided by the SDDOT
Road Safety Inspection (RSI) program. Locations with clusters of crashes were
identified through the use of crash plots or RSI references. The crash data for the cluster
locations were then analyzed to determine potential needed safety improvements. The
results of the crash analysis are shown in Figure 13.

A special analysis was conducted at 12th Street S./17th Avenue because of public
comments received in conjunction with the study survey of public opinion. There were
several comments indicating excessive delays and potential safety problems at that
location. An observation at the site showed that there were considerable traffic backups


Brookings Area Master Transportation Plan                                            Page 18
during the morning and afternoon travel periods for the adjacent middle school and near-
by intermediate school. The locations of the schools result in nearly every driver
traveling to either school passing through the all-way stop intersection at 12th Street
S/17th Avenue. The intersection is also a pedestrian crossing for students and is staffed
by a crossing guard. The traffic backups haven't shown up in the current level of service
analysis, but the future-year analysis indicates a capacity problem at this intersection. It
appears reasonable to plan for future intersection improvements, including signalization.

The congestion at 12th Street South/17th Avenue points out the need for conducting
studies for new schools to provide the input of experienced traffic engineers on vehicle
circulation and pedestrian safety issues. School transportation issues can often be
counter-intuitive and difficult to solve without experienced advice.

There were a number of on-line survey responses related to the safety of the railroad
crossings in Brookings. There is also a history of concern among Brookings residents
about a potential increase of rail service on the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern railroad
that bisects the area. Crash statistics do not show a current safety problem at the existing
at-grade railroad crossings. Many cities, however, are planning for grade-separated
crossings on arterial streets to avoid future traffic delays and safety problems. If
Brookings adopted a policy to provide grade separations on important arterials, the most
likely locations would be on Main Avenue, 22nd Avenue and 34th Avenue. Building
grade separations on Main Avenue and 22nd Avenue could involve significant disruption
of existing traffic patterns and potential right-of-way impacts in the vicinity of the
railroad crossings. The cost of each grade separation could be relatively high due to the
long structures required.

Bicycle and Pedestrian

Bicycle and pedestrian travel in Brookings is characterized by an established network of
facilities with plans for future expansion. A system of multi-use recreation trails serve
parts of the community and has recently been expanded to the east side of Interstate 29.
The existing system of trails is shown in Figure 14. Other bicycle and pedestrian travel
occurs on existing streets and sidewalks.

The South Dakota State University campus sees considerable pedestrian and bicycle
travel which extends to off-campus residences and destinations. These pedestrian and
bicycle interactions with the larger community could be encouraged with continued
planning for future pedestrian and bicycle facilities, particularly designated lanes/paths.

A specialized study of pedestrian issues along Medary Avenue on the SDSU campus was
conducted and a technical memo outlining the analysis and recommendations of that
special study has been included in the Appendix Part 2.

Transit

The Brookings Area is served by Brookings Area Transit Authority (BATA), which
provides advance-reservation transit service throughout the community and weekly
service to other communities. BATA has conducted extensive system assessment and


Brookings Area Master Transportation Plan                                           Page 19
planning for the future. Their current business plan calls for establishment of a new fixed
route system serving the SDSU campus and other schools, commercial destinations in the
downtown and outlying areas, and employment destinations. The BATA plan presents an
exciting opportunity for public transportation service, but also present challenges in terms
of funding.

Special Events

A number of special events occur in the Brookings area each year and create high
demand on the local transportation system. Those events include the Sidewalk Arts
Festival, SDSU sporting events, and sporting events/programs at the Swiftel Center.
Special studies were conducted for the Sidewalk Arts Festival and SDSU football game
events. Memoranda detailing the findings and recommendations of those special studies
are included in the Appendix.

Freight

Freight transportation needs in the Brookings area are met by truck and rail services. The
primary routes for intrastate and interstate truck traffic through the study area are
Interstate 29 and US 14. Smaller truck volumes also use SD 324 and county roads to
access the study area. Local hauling of bulk materials occurs on US 14B, 34th Avenue
and 475th Avenue. Additional delivery activity occurs on Brookings city streets.

Freight rail service is provided by the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern (DM &E) railroad
which travels east and west through Brookings and provides connections to the Canadian
Pacific rail network and other railroad systems. There are several sidings on the DM & E
within the study area to serve sources for grain, sand/gravel, warehoused goods and
ethanol.

Comments received from businesses and the general public during the study indicate that
freight needs are currently being met and should continue to be met with normal growth
of trucking and rail services. Business comments, however, supported improvements on
34th Avenue to provide a second paved access to the industrial park and sand/gravel sites.

Air

General aviation services are provided at the Brookings Municipal Airport through a
fixed-base operator. The nearest commercial passenger service is provided at Watertown
or Sioux Falls. A recent airport planning effort has resulted in a new master plan and
Environmental Assessment which identified realignment of runways at the existing
airport as the preferred alternative for future airport facilities.

While there is a desire for commercial passenger service in Brookings, public comments
indicated that having more affordable air travel alternatives at Sioux Falls or Watertown
is more important to the Brookings-area traveler than other potential changes to local air
service. Planned changes to the Brookings Municipal Airport should continue to provide
needed service.

Future Conditions 

Transportation operating conditions were estimated for 25 years in the future to provide
insight on which transportation improvements will be needed within the planning
horizon. The future operating conditions were estimated by first forecasting future levels
of traffic, and then analyzing operations based on the forecast traffic. Finally, future
transportation deficiencies were identified and a list of transportation needs prepared.

The current Brookings comprehensive plan, Vision 2020, is reaching maturity and will
need to be updated. Land use plans from Vision 2020 were augmented with recent
development and zoning information to allow production of 25-year traffic forecasts.

Traffic Forecasting

Traffic volumes for 2020 and 2035 were forecast through preparation and use of a travel
demand model. The model was prepared using QRS II software and correlates traffic
volumes to land use and subsequent trip generation within traffic analysis zones (TAZ's).
The TAZ structure is shown in Figure 15 and represents areas of fairly uniform land use
types with TAZ boundaries that fall along major area roadways. The model output was
used to factor traffic counts and produce the 2020 and 2035 traffic forecasts. Link
forecasts were evaluated using Florida Department of Transportation planning level of
service tables to provide assessment of future operations. (See page 15 for discussion of
use of Florida level of service tables.)

QRS II software was used because its cost is within reach of most municipal users and its
flexible data structure allows use of simple land use/travel demand relationships. It is
recommended that the forecasting model be periodically updated to allow it to provide
continuing service. The next update should be scheduled for 2015. A model update
process consists of gathering new count data, revising the street network to reflect
construction, and revising and recalibrating the actual forecasting model. Under current
rules, cities are not eligible for Federal urban planning funds until their population
reaches 50,000 persons.

Future Volumes and Level of Service

Forecast traffic volumes and Levels of Service for the 2020 and 2035 Brookings-area
roadway network are shown in Figures 16, 17, 18 and 19. The analysis shows that the
following roadway sections are anticipated to reach LOS "C" by 2035:

       ·   US 14B ­ US 14 junction west of Brookings to Medary Ave.
       ·   11th Street (N) ­ 16th Ave. to 22nd Ave.
       ·   8th Street (N) ­ Medary Ave. to 16th Ave.
       ·   6th Street ­ Western Ave. to 22nd Ave.
       ·   6th Street ­ I-29 to 32nd Ave.
       ·   US 14 ­ US 14B junction east of Brookings to 476th Ave.
       ·   2nd Street South ­ Division Ave. to Main Ave.

       ·   22nd Avenue ­ US 14B to 11th Street (N)
       ·   22nd Avenue ­ 8th Street South to 32nd Street South

The following roadway sections are expected to reach LOS "D" by 2035:
       · 6th Street ­ 22nd Avenue to I-29
       · 8th Street South ­ Main Ave. to 17th Ave.
       · Main Avenue ­ 20th Street South to 32nd Street South
       · Medary Avenue ­ 6th Street to 3rd Street
       · 22nd Avenue ­ 11th Street to 8th Street South

In addition, the following intersections are expected to reach an actionable level of
service by 2035:
        · 6th Street/13th Avenue
        · 6th Street/22nd Avenue
        · 6th Street/25th Avenue
        · 3rd Street/Medary Avenue
        · Eastbrook Drive/22nd Avenue
        · 8th Street South/Main Avenue
        · 12th Street South/17th Avenue
        · 20th Street South/Main Avenue
        · 20th Street South/17th Avenue
        · 20th Street South/22nd Avenue
        · 32nd Street South/22nd Avenue

Pedestrian and Bicycle Plans

The planned network of multi-use recreation trails and bicycle facilities is shown in
Figure 21. This planned network was prepared through a community-based planning
process and represents a 2030 planning horizon. Pedestrian travel will also be facilitated
by sidewalks in all new street development. A potential gap in the network of multi-use
facilities may be prevented by inclusion of a side-path along Medary Avenue, from 6th
Street to 12th Street South. The Medary Avenue side-path may be built as part of other
street reconstruction projects or by expansion of existing sidewalks. Details of the
Medary Avenue side-path are shown in Figure 21.




Brookings Area Master Transportation Plan                                          Page 23
Pedestrian issues are also closely related to the planning and operations of schools. Tools
such as coordinated school district/city planning, safe routes to school programs and
school circulation studies provide the means for creating a safe, efficient pedestrian
system and are recommended for implementation by Brookings-area local governments
and agencies.

Transit Plans

Brookings Area Transit Authority (BATA) has created a business plan for establishing a
fixed-route system serving major destinations in the Brookings area. The fixed-route
system is shown in Figure 22. It will require community financial support to become a
reality, but has the potential to eliminate single-vehicle trips on the system and extend the
time until street investments need to be made.

List of Needs

A list of future transportation needs was prepared based on future year traffic analysis,
safety analysis, existing plans and public comments. That list of needs is shown in
Figure 20 and will serve as a basis for preparation of the ultimate project program found
later in this report.

Standards Development 

A City's goals and objectives are frequently translated into policies and procedures that
guide future growth and development. Those policies and procedures have been included
in updates and additions to Brookings' administrative documents, including the Major
Streets Plan, Design Standards and Typical Street Cross-sections.

Major Streets Plan

An updated version of the Major Streets Plan is shown in Figure 23. The Major Streets
Plan was updated to show extensions of the urban street network into growth areas
surrounding the city.

Design Standards

Design Standards were created for the City of Brookings to help guide development of
new transportation facilities. The Design Standards strengthen the connection between
land uses and transportation facilities, provide access management standards and
procedures for assessing the potential transportation impacts of new developments. The
Design Standards are reproduced in the Appendix and are accompanied by a number of
supporting documents.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities

Extensive planning of bicycle and multi-user recreational facilities has already taken
place in the Brookings area and a plan document has been adopted. Pedestrian and
bicycle travel, however, also needs to be included as part of any future expansion of the
transportation network. For that reason, pedestrian and bicycle facilities have been
included as part of the Typical Street Cross-sections found in the Design Standards and in
this report.

Typical Street Cross-sections

The Typical Street Cross-sections are keyed to the various functional classes and will
help guide the design of roadways shown in the Major Streets Plan. They are shown in
Figures 24 and 25.

Public participation in the transportation planning process was actively solicited
throughout the study process and public comments have helped to drive the development
and selection of future transportation projects. Public involvement opportunities
included:
    · Comments provided as part of the origin/destination survey
    · Structured responses to the online survey instruments
    · Comments submitted via email and Facebook
    · Written and verbal comments provided at two public meetings
Open communication was also maintained with the Study Advisory Team and local
elected officials throughout the study.

The online survey instrument provided specific information on public attitudes to a
number of aspects of Brookings area transportation. A detailed summary of the survey
responses is contained in the Appendix, Part 5.

The survey shows that auto travel is the primary means of transportation in the
community, but that other travel modes are also present. Figure 26 shows the distribution
of travel modes.

Brookings area traffic congestion didn't appear to be a major concern of the survey
respondents. Figure 28 shows that 73% rated traffic congestion as a minor or non-
existent problem.

Persons completing the survey feel that the difficulty of travel to some Brookings area
destination to increase in the future. Figure 29 displays the response spectrum and shows
that travel to and from SDSU is expected to be among the most difficult trips in the
future, a concern that could be alleviated by a combination of street improvements,
transit, walking and bicycling. Travel to and from the Industrial Park is also expected to
be a future concern.

Question 21 of the survey provided the respondents an opportunity to allocate
transportation investments into categories, rating the percent of a hypothetical $100
investment that would be assigned to components of the transportation system. The
results of that question are shown in Figure 31.

Survey respondents were carefully favorable toward investing in transportation, with the
largest response favoring a slight increase in the proportion of taxes going to
transportation and a similar percent of the respondents somewhat supporting a slight
increase in local taxes for transportation improvements. Those responses are shown in
Figures 32 and 33.

Transportation Program 

The final section of this plan documents the preparation of a program of transportation
projects for future construction. The List of Transportation Needs was prioritized based
on public input and the available funding for transportation improvements was forecast
for the coming 25 years. The potential funding was applied to the ranked projects to
result in the final transportation program.

Project List with Cost Estimates

The previously-prepared Project List was modified to show planning-level estimates of
construction cost (current day cost). The resulting Project List with Cost Estimates is
shown in Figure 34. Each of the projects is discussed in the following paragraphs:

Main Avenue/20th Street S. ­ Traffic Signals

Delays and poor peak-hour level of service have prompted public requests for traffic
signals at Main Avenue/20th Street S. Signal warrant analysis shows that signals will be
needed at this location within a matter of years.

Main Avenue, 20th Street S. to 32nd Street S.

Traffic forecasts indicate that a four or five-lane roadway will be needed before 2035.
Construction may be phased with a short-term project to reconstruct to a 3-lane urban
roadway, followed by later addition of two more lanes.

Medary Avenue, 6th Street to 15th Street S.

In addition to a 2012 resurfacing project, intersection improvements at 3rd Street,
including a traffic signal, and a side-path bicycle route will be needed. The side-path
may also be extended north to the SDSU campus. An additional left-turn phase is also
needed on the traffic signal at 6th Street.

22nd Avenue, 11th Street to 8th Street S.

Capacity and safety of this roadways section will be enhanced by providing wider lanes
and curb radii on commercial driveways.

25th Avenue, between 9th Street and 10th Street

Future development will be facilitated by extending 25th Avenue north to connect with
10th Street, which will provide access to 22nd Avenue.




Brookings Area Master Transportation Plan                                         Page 44
6th Street, 22nd Avenue to west of 34th Avenue

Reconstruction of this roadway section provides the opportunity to remedy a number of
safety and capacity problems while revitalizing the busiest roadway in Brookings.

6th Street, west of Western Avenue to Main Avenue

Reconstruction of this roadway section will improve the Western Avenue intersection
and update the urban arterial. Construction is currently planned for 2013.

6th Street, Main Avenue to Medary Avenue

Reconstruction of this roadway section will complete the reconstruction of 6th Street
through Brookings.

8th Street South, Main Avenue to 22nd Avenue

Traffic forecasts indicate that expansion of this roadway to 5 lanes will be needed
between 5 and 15 years in the future. Safety improvements are also needed at the 8th
Street South, Main Avenue intersection.

20th Street South, Main Avenue to Cumberland Court

Construction of a 3-lane urban roadway is needed to serve the growing residential areas
west of Main Avenue.

20th Street South, Main Avenue to 22nd Avenue

The potential for a new Interstate crossing or interchange could create the need to widen
this roadway in the time period after 2035. Therefore, additional right-of-way should be
protected before the adjacent property is fully developed.

20th Street South, 22nd Avenue to 34th Avenue

Analysis shows that an additional I-29 overpass or interchange will provide needed
congestion relief on 6th Street and allow additional access to the industrial park. Of the
alternatives considered, a new 20th Street S. interchange provides the greatest congestion
relief. Any additional Interstate access is subject to Federal requirements for study and
review.

34th Avenue, 8th Street S. to 20th Street S.

34th Avenue was recently reconstructed to provide an urban arterial roadway between 6th
Street and 8th Street S. Providing a paved rural arterial roadway will connect to the
potential new overpass/interchange at I-29 and provide alternative paved service to the
industrial park. This project could include a grade-separate railroad crossing.



Brookings Area Master Transportation Plan                                         Page 45
34th Avenue, 20th Street S. to SD 324

Improving the existing gravel roadway to a paved rural arterial roadway as far as 32nd
Street S. will complete a vital arterial roadway between US 14 and SD 324. Selected
improvements and resurfacing may also be needed between 32nd Street S. and SD 324.

17th Avenue, selected improvements

Providing intersection widening and a traffic signal at 12th Street S. will help alleviate
current and future congestion problems.

SDSU Area improvements

Pedestrian improvements on Medary Avenue were identified as part of a previous
Technical Memorandum (included in Appendix, Part 2). These and selected intersection
improvements will allow the street system to match campus growth.

32nd Avenue, 10th Street to US 14B

Completion of this section of 32nd Avenue will provide a collector roadway extending
between US 14B and Prince Drive.

15th Street S., 7th Avenue

The City of Brookings has planned for these development-driven projects to connect gaps
between existing portions of these streets.

Transit System Additional Services

Brookings Area Transit has planned for expansion of services to include fixed routes
between SDSU and other in-town destinations. While many of the costs associated with
expanded service may be covered by Federal Transit Administration funding, local
support will also be needed. It is appropriate to consider the transit costs along with the
other transportation projects.

Bike/Pedestrian Planned Improvements

The 2010 Park Master Plan identified a city-wide system of sharrows, trails and other
improvements which will also be part of the transportation system. This project will
facilitate consideration and implementation of the improvements.

Railroad Crossing Improvements ­ Grade Separated Crossings

A planned expansion of service on the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad spurred
talk about adding grade-separated crossings on arterial streets in Brookings to deal with



Brookings Area Master Transportation Plan                                            Page 46
expected delays and emergency response problems. Since the purchase of the DM&E by
the Canadian Pacific Railroad, the likelihood of a large increase in rail traffic is uncertain.
Grade separations, however, still have the capability to address potential rail crossing
delays and safety problems. Building grade separations comes with a large potential cost
for structures and impacts on existing properties. A grade-separation project has been
included in the program to allow consideration along with other railroad crossing
treatments.

Further study of the benefits and costs of building grade-separated crossings is
recommended. Sample guidelines for study of grade-separated crossings is included in
Appendix, Part 4.

Railroad Crossing Improvements ­ Gate Arms and other Improvements

This project would provide gate arms and associated improvements at the existing
railroad crossings on Western Avenue, Medary Avenue, 17th Avenue, and possibly 34th
Avenue.

Western Avenue Improvements ­ Trail Ridge Road to south of 20th Street South

Western Avenue would be improved to a paved collector street to serve the developing
residential neighborhoods in southwest Brookings.

Western Avenue Improvements ­ south of 20th Street South to Sinai Road

This long-term improvement would extend the paved collector street south to serve
planned development.

32nd Street South Improvements

Traffic forecasts indicate that intersection improvements will be needed at the Main
Avenue and 22nd Avenue intersections before 2035.

US 14B ­ Intersection improvements at 16th Avenue, Stadium Drive

Analysis indicates that turn lanes and intersection lighting will be needed to address
safety needs.

US 14B ­ Intersection improvements at Western Avenue

Analysis indicates that turn lanes and intersection lighting will be needed to address
safety needs.

Additional Projects

One additional project was discussed as part of this study whose scope remains unclear.
Currently a traffic signal serves the 6th Street/12th Avenue intersection and has provided
service to the SDSU campus for many years. Campus roadways and parking are being
updated, however, with the result that 13th Avenue having higher importance. But, 13th
Avenue is narrow and has on-street parking, curb-side sidewalk and an offset intersection
at 6th Street. The campus revisions and the potential fixed-route transit service both have
the potential to reduce the vehicular traffic on 12th and 13th, which could produce a
reduced need for a traffic signal at 12th or 13th. The question of whether to move the
traffic signal to 13th Avenue will continue to be considered as campus revisions occur.

NOTES:
   1) Transit system additional services includes a mixture of capital costs and ongoing expenses and represents 5 years of additional local support.  Other funding will also be required from
        Federal and State sources.  See the BATA Business Plan for more details.
   2) Cost estimates calculated using present day costs and may include all or portions of cost reports in State and Local programs and Appendix Part 7

                                                                                                                          FIGURE 34  PROJECT LIST WITH COST ESTIMATES
Funding Potential

Financial planning is an essential part of civic improvements such as those contained in
this transportation plan. The realities of available financial resources will determine
whether projects can be built and will constrain the implementation of the project
program. Therefore, it is useful to estimate the amount of funding that may be available
during the life of this plan.

Transportation improvements in South Dakota may be funded by Federal, State or Local
sources, with most projects receiving some mixture of funding sources. The South
Dakota Department of Transportation administers Federal and State funds through a
number of programs, including those specifically for the Interstate system, for urban
roadways, for bridges, and for road safety. In addition, SDDOT has special programs for
industrial park roads, transportation system enhancements and safe routes to school,
among others. Counties and cities receive an annual apportionment of Federal funds and
each local government has state-authorized revenue sources that are used for
transportation.

Historically, SDDOT has spent an average of about $1.7 million per year in the
Brookings area through all programs. The City of Brookings allocates approximately
$1.5 million per year to transportation from sales and use tax. The City may also assess
some costs to adjacent property owners. Based on these findings, we estimate that
approximately $3.2 million per year will be available to fund projects in this plan. Over
the 25-year life of this plan the current sources could produce a total of $80 million,
expressed in current-year dollars.

With the economy recovering from a severe recession and governments on all levels
dealing with recession-impacted budgets, the reliability of any revenue projections is
subject to question. The funding potential provided here has been prepared with the best
available information, but should be reviewed as conditions change.

While the estimate above provides financial context, it does not tell the whole story of
transportation funding. Each year, the SDDOT and the local government entities
program projects based on available funds. Those decisions are made based on whether a
project qualifies for funding under the requirements of each funding source.
Programming decisions are also based on the comparative advantages and disadvantages
of each project. This plan provides information to make those programming decisions
possible.

Concluding Remarks

The projects shown in Figures 34 ­ 37 are the result of technical analysis and input
provided by the public, elected officials and the project Study Team. They are available
to be chosen for inclusion in the local and statewide construction programs. The
selection of projects is based on the latest understanding of transportation needs, public
demand and available funding.

This plan is intended to serve as a resource for local and state planning and programming
officials. It is limited, however, by a planning horizon of approximately 25 years and
should be periodically updated to maintain the best utility.

RE: Observation of pedestrian operations, Medary Avenue at SDSU campus

An observation of pedestrian operations was conducted on Wednesday, November 3, 2010, to determine the
conditions experienced by pedestrians crossing Medary Avenue on the South Dakota State University
campus. This location has been identified as having heavy pedestrian traffic and frequent interaction
between pedestrians and motor vehicles. The observed conditions suggest some potential improvements,
provided in the recommendations section of this memo.




Pedestrian Crossing Conditions on Medary Avenue ­ SDSU Campus
The observation was conducted between Campus Drive on the north and 8th Street on the south, an area that
contains many marked crosswalks and street intersections. Weather conditions were conducive to heavy
pedestrian and bicycle travel on campus, with sunshine and a high temperature in the 60's. Wednesday also
represents a day of relatively high class incidence and attendance.
Observation notes are listed below:

     ·     All the marked crosswalks were heavily used, particularly in the periods between classes. The
           pedestrian crossing activity seemed to be well distributed between the marked crosswalks. Bicycles
           also shared the sidewalks and pedestrian crossings, representing between 10% and 20% of the
           crossing volume.
     ·     Students don't seem to spend much time checking traffic prior to entering the street. Rather, many
           students appear to assume that motor vehicles will be able to stop and yield the right of way. A check
           of crash records indicates that no pedestrian vs. vehicle crashes were reported to the State during the
           reporting period beginning in January, 2006 and ending with the most recently processed 2010
           records. This pedestrian behavior makes it unlikely that pedestrian-activated signals will be well used
           because the pedestrians will be unwilling to wait for the signal to cycle.

     ·     Street lights were observed to have been extinguished while it was still difficult to see pedestrians in
           the early morning. Further, the lighting uniformity and intensity could be increased to provide better
           pedestrian visibility.
     ·     Some of the crossings were marked with W11-2 warning signs, but did not have the required arrow
           plaque. Other crossings did not have warning signs.
     ·     Drivers had difficulty seeing approaching pedestrians at some crossings because of adjacent trees
           and other obstructions.
     ·     Drivers had difficulty making progress during heavy pedestrian crossing periods. Slow vehicular
           progress probably aided safety, but reduced the ability of Medary Avenue to carry traffic.
           Unfortunately, there is no parallel route for diversion of through-traffic without a relatively significant
           time cost.

     RECOMMENDATIONS
     While pedestrian activity on Medary Avenue seems to be occurring relatively safely and efficiently, there
     are a few actions that could improve the uniformity of the crossing conditions and assist drivers in seeing
     and responding to pedestrians:
     ·     Street amenities ­ pedestrian curb bump-outs at the crosswalk locations could help improve visibility
           at all times and control speeds during off-peak times. This technique was used in downtown
           Brookings as part of the recent streetscaping project. The curb bump-out can also be used with
           colored-pavement crosswalks to produce a visually pleasing and highly recognizable pedestrian
           crossing. Campus entrance features could also be employed at the ends of this section of Medary
           Avenue to help raise driver awareness of changed street conditions.
     ·     Lighting ­ more uniform lighting could be provided to assist with pedestrian visibility during ambient
           low-light conditions. Other jurisdictions have combined low-height lighting in conjunction with
           pedestrian bump-outs to provide nighttime emphasis to crossing areas.
     ·     Signs ­ it may not be necessary to provide warning signs at each crossing if curb bump-outs and
           other attention-drawing devices are used. It is appropriate, however, to warn motorists that they are
           entering an area with multiple pedestrian crossings. While many signing combinations might be
           applied, one that suggests itself is placing a W11-2 with a flashing beacon at the ends of the campus
           section of Medary Avenue, supplemented by campus signing indicating multiple pedestrian crossings
           ahead.

  Standard:
11    The Emergency Vehicle (W11-8) sign (see Figure 2C-10) with the EMERGENCY SIGNAL AHEAD
  (W11-12P) supplemental plaque (see Figure 2C-10) shall be placed in advance of all emergency-vehicle
  traffic control signals (see Chapter 4G).
  Option:
12    The Emergency Vehicle (W11-8) sign, or a word message sign indicating the type of emergency vehicle (such
  as rescue squad), may be used in advance of the emergency-vehicle station when no emergency-vehicle traffic
  control signal is present.
13    A Warning Beacon (see Section 4L.03) may be used with any Vehicular Traffic Warning sign to indicate
  specific periods when the condition or activity is present or is likely to be present, or to provide enhanced
  sign conspicuity.
14    A supplemental WHEN FLASHING (W16-13P) plaque (see Figure 2C-12) may be used with any Vehicular
  Traffic Warning sign that is supplemented with a Warning Beacon to indicate specific periods when the condition
  or activity is present or is likely to be present.
Section 2C.50 Non-Vehicular Warning Signs (W11-2, W11-3, W11-4, W11-6, W11-7, W11-9, and
     W11-16 through W11-22)
  Option:
01    Non-Vehicular Warning (W11-2, W11-3, W11-4, W11-6, W11-7, W11-9, and W11-16 through W11-22) signs
  (see Figure 2C-11) may be used to alert road users in advance of locations where unexpected entries into the
  roadway might occur or where shared use of the roadway by pedestrians, animals, or equestrians might occur.
  Support:
02    These conflicts might be relatively confined, or might occur randomly over a segment of roadway.
  Guidance:
03    If used in advance of a pedestrian, snowmobile, or equestrian crossing, the W11-2, W11-6, W11-7, and W11-9
  signs should be supplemented with plaques (see Section 2C.55) with the legend AHEAD or XX FEET to inform
  road users that they are approaching a point where crossing activity might occur.

  2009 Edition                                                                                                   Page 131

  Standard:
04    If a post-mounted W11-2, W11-6, W11-7, or W11-9 sign is placed at the location of the crossing point
  where pedestrians, snowmobilers, or equestrians might be crossing the roadway, a diagonal downward
  pointing arrow (W16-7P) plaque (see Figure 2C-12) shall be mounted below the sign. If the W11-2, W11-6,
  W11-7, or W11-9 sign is mounted overhead, the W16-7P plaque shall not be used.
  Option:
05    A Pedestrian Crossing (W11-2) sign may be placed overhead or may be post-mounted with a diagonal
  downward pointing arrow (W16-7P) plaque at the crosswalk location where Yield Here To (Stop Here For)
  Pedestrians signs (see Section 2B.11) have been installed in advance of the crosswalk.
  Standard:
06    If a W11-2 sign has been post-mounted at the crosswalk location where a Yield Here To (Stop Here For)
  Pedestrians sign is used on the approach, the Yield Here To (Stop Here For) Pedestrians sign shall not be
  placed on the same post as or block the road user's view of the W11-2 sign.
  Option:
07    An advance Pedestrian Crossing (W11-2) sign with an AHEAD or a distance supplemental plaque may be
  used in conjunction with a Yield Here To (Stop Here For) Pedestrians sign on the approach to the same crosswalk.
08    The crossing location identified by a W11-2, W11-6, W11-7, or W11-9 sign may be defined with crosswalk
  markings (see Section 3B.18).
09    The W11-2 and W11-9 signs and their related supplemental plaques may have a fluorescent yellow-green
  background with a black legend and border.
  Guidance:
10    When a fluorescent yellow-green background is used, a systematic approach featuring one background color
  within a zone or area should be used. The mixing of standard yellow and fluorescent yellow-green backgrounds
  within a selected site area should be avoided.
  Option:
11    A Warning Beacon (see Section 4L.03) may be used with any Non-Vehicular Warning sign to indicate specific
  periods when the condition or activity is present or is likely to be present, or to provide enhanced sign conspicuity.
12    A supplemental WHEN FLASHING (W16-13P) plaque (see Figure 2C-12) may be used with any
  Non-Vehicular Warning sign that is supplemented with a Warning Beacon to indicate specific periods when the
  condition or activity is present or is likely to be present.
Section 2C.51 Playground Sign (W15-1)
  Option:
01    The Playground (W15-1) sign (see Figure 2C-11) may be used to give advance warning of a designated
  children's playground that is located adjacent to the road.
02    The Playground sign may have a fluorescent yellow-green background with a black legend and border.
  Guidance:
03    If the access to the playground area requires a roadway crossing, the application of crosswalk pavement
  markings (see Section 3B.18) and Non-Vehicular Warning signs (see Section 2C.50) should be considered.
Section 2C.52 NEW TRAFFIC PATTERN AHEAD Sign (W23-2)
  Option:
01    A NEW TRAFFIC PATTERN AHEAD (W23-2) sign (see Figure 2C-6) may be used on the approach to
  an intersection or along a section of roadway to provide advance warning of a change in traffic patterns, such as
  revised lane usage, roadway geometry, or signal phasing.
  Guidance:
02    The NEW TRAFFIC PATTERN AHEAD sign should be removed when the traffic pattern returns to normal,
  when the changed pattern is no longer considered to be new, or within six months.
Section 2C.53 Use of Supplemental Warning Plaques
  Option:
01    A supplemental warning plaque (see Figure 2C-12) may be displayed with a warning or regulatory sign when
  engineering judgment indicates that road users require additional warning information beyond that contained in
  the main message of the warning or regulatory sign.

RE: Brookings Summer Arts Festival traffic operations

Traffic operations were observed and the following conditions were noted:

        ·    The permanent message signs on I-29 were not used during the festival.

        ·    New traffic signals at the I-29/6th St. exit were under construction, but were not available for use
             during the festival.

        ·    A highway patrol officer was observed directing traffic at the off-ramp, but had some difficulty due to
             the size of the intersection.

             the First Bank & Trust. At times the available parking was challenged and there were long
             lines of visitors waiting for the shuttle bus.

      ·      The portion of 6th Street adjacent to the festival grounds was a combination of pedestrian
             mall and through street, creating a considerable number of potentially-hazardous conflicts
             between pedestrians and vehicles.




Recommendations: The following preliminary recommendations are based on the festival
observations:
      ·      Communication ­ Use the permanent message signs on I-29 and temporary changeable
             message signs to communicate with drivers, directing them to available off-site parking
             areas. Temporary driver advisory radio would provide another good means of
             communication, if resources are available.
      ·      Clarity ­ Clarify the role of 6th Street in the vicinity of the festival grounds. Either make a
             short stretch of the street (approximately three blocks) a pedestrian mall by use of temporary
             traffic control devices, or create well-marked crosswalks controlled by police officers or
             temporary traffic signals.
      ·      Capacity ­ Provide more shuttle buses during the peak periods and identify other locations
             for external parking. Open areas on the SDSU campus north of Coughlin Stadium would
             provide a large area for parking and would allow greater use of both I-29 exits. Traffic
             signals on the northbound ramp terminal at I-29/6th Street would facilitate flow from the
             Interstate, but will probably require a special timing plan or external control for special
             events.

RE: Game Day Special Event Analysis

Traffic operations were observed on two occasions to determine the impact of a SDSU home football game
special event on the Brookings-area transportation system. Observations were conducted on 9/18/2010 and
10/9/2010 and included the I-29 interchanges for 6th Street and US 14B, 6th Street, US 14B, 22nd Avenue and
Medary Avenue.
The observations found that traffic generally flowed well, despite the additional demands placed by the
special event. A few locations, however, showed periodic congestion and/or safety issues. They include:
        ·   The northbound I-29 off-ramp at 6th Street experienced queues as long as ten vehicles. A new traffic
            signal had been installed and gap/extension times could be fine-tuned. Striping and signal visibility
            may also need to be adjusted.
        ·   The intersection of 6th Street/22nd Avenue could be modified to provide more standard lanes and
            phasing for out-of-town drivers. Indecision and hesitation were noted on the north and south
            approaches.
        ·   The intersections on US 14B at 16th Avenue and Stadium Drive were the site of conflicts and
            avoidance maneuvers as vehicles turned into the Stadium area (see pictures, note conflicts and skid
            marks). Left turn lanes and intersection lighting could aid operations and avoid growth in crash
            incidence.

Complete observation notes are attached for reference.


OPTIONS ANALYSIS
The conflicts and delays related to turning traffic on US 14B could be corrected by separating the left turning
traffic from the through traffic in one of two ways:
     ·     Widen the roadway to provide for left turn lanes at 16th Avenue and Stadium Drive.
     ·     Widen the roadway to provide a median from east of 16th Avenue to west of Stadium Drive. Provision
           could be made for all movements at the US 14B/16th Avenue intersection and the ¾ movement
           intersection (westbound left turn and thru, northbound right turn, eastbound right turn and thru) could
           be provided at US 16B/Stadium Drive. This configuration would necessitate a circulation roadway
           between 16th Avenue and Stadium Drive to allow opportunities for all movements from Stadium Drive.
Roadway lighting should be included with any of these alternatives.
It appears that the first option is the least expensive and the most congruent with the potential benefits of any
safety improvement at this location.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The following actions are recommended to address issues observed on game day:
     ·     Monitor and adjust signal timing at I-29 northbound/6th Street. Consider changes to pavement
           marking and signal visibility.
     ·     Provide more standard lane configuration and phasing at 6th Street/22nd Avenue.
     ·     Provide left turn lanes and intersection lighting on US 14B at 16th Avenue and Stadium Drive.

RE: Game Day observations (9/18/10)

        ·   3:30 to 5:00 pm observation on 6th Street and 22nd Avenue

                  o     Traffic on I-29 off Ramp is starting to increase, vehicle queues observed but all vehicles are
                        able to clear during the cycle. Most vehicles observed sitting was 16 with an average around
                        8 vehicles per cycle after 3:30 pm.

                  o     Flow on 6th Street between I29 and Medary in both directions is very good. Some traffic
                        congestion near the Burger King and McDonalds driveway, vehicles slow to make turning
                        movements into the driveways.

                  o     Geometric constraints at 6th Street and 22nd Avenue cause hesitation, the north and south
                        approaches are confusing to drivers. I observed many vehicles make lane changes near the
                        intersection as they appeared to not know what lane they should be in. There is no left turn
                        phasing southbound to eastbound, volumes are not high but there were cycles that didn't
                        completely clear.

                  o     6th Street and Medary functioned very well through the observation period.

                  o     22nd Avenue was busy but I didn't observe any capacity or delay problems.

                  o     Only a few pedestrians were observed along 6th Street.

                  o     The pavement markings at I29 and 6th Street (east ramp) were updated with the installation of
                        the signal, I seen many times when one vehicle followed the new markings and drivers that
                        use the intersection frequently just do what they did before which means they cut the drivers
                        using the new pavement markings off. This is a concern for accident potential. The SDDOT
                        may want to put some tubular markers outside the edge line to delineate the new lane paths.
                        This paragraph is referencing the RTL on the south approach at I29 and 6th Street.

                  o     Both Wal-Mart and Lowes seemed very busy during the few hours before the game, this adds
                        to the congestion at 6th Street and 22nd Avenue.

        ·   5:00 to 5:50 pm observation on Highway 14 Bypass and Medary Avenue

                  o     Vehicles using the Hwy 14 Bypass during this time seemed to be traveling below the posted
                        speed limit. The turning traffic and vehicles parked on the SDSU access roadways I believe
                        caused other to slow down.

Notes 09182010.docx
                 o      The intersection of the Highway 14 Bypass and Medary Avenue operated with little to no
                        delay.

                 o      With all the congestion on the SDSU access roadways leading to the tailgating and parking
                        areas, vehicles turning off of Highway 14 Bypass could not turn at high speeds. They turned
                        very slowly which caused Highway 14 Bypass travelers to use the shoulder to go around the
                        left turning vehicles and continue. No turn lanes at the SDSU access roadways certainly
                        cause some concerns in regards to accident potential. Vehicle tire marks were observed on
                        the Highway 14 Bypass at the west access roadway entrance.

                 o      They Highway 14 Bypass does not have any street lights near the SDSU access roadways.

                 o      The turn lanes at 22nd Avenue and Highway 14 Bypass appear to make getting off and on
                        the Highway 14 Bypass more efficient.

      ·    8:35 to 9:30 pm observation on 6th Street

                 o      The lighting at the Ped crossings on Medary Avenue was poor, I observed pedestrians
                        crossing at two locations and it was difficult to seem them until they were in the street.

                 o      The progression on 6th Street after the game from Medary to I29 was very good; there was
                        some delay on the north approach at 6th Street and 22nd Avenue for approximately 15
                        minutes.

                 o      Game was over at 8:47 pm and traffic by 9:25 pm was back to normal throughout the city,
                        during the peak traffic congestion was minimal.

RE: Game Day observations (10/09/10)

        ·   3:00 to 6:00 pm observation on 6th Street, 22nd Avenue, US 14B, and Medary Avenue

                o       Between 3 pm and 4 pm approximately 5 cars on average were observed at the I29,
                        throughout the observation period it fluctuated from 3 to 12 cars queued at any given cycle
                        but certainly no major delays.

                o       6th Street between I29 and 22nd Street was busy at times but long queues were not observed.

                o       6th Street from I29 to Medary Avenue operated well during the observation period.

                o       22nd Avenue was busy but I didn't observe any significant capacity problems, at the
                        intersection of US 14B additional harvest truck traffic seemed to cause longer queues than
                        observed during the September game. The Brookings area received some rainfall around 3
                        pm which may have caused an increase of harvest vehicles to transport what was harvested
                        to keep moistures down.

                o       At approximately 4:10 pm (2 hours before game start) both Stadium Road and 16th Avenue
                        had parked cars from the existing stadium parking lots to US 14B. This as observed
                        previously slows down vehicles turning off US 14B onto the access roadways to the stadium.
                        In a few cases vehicles on US 14B had to slow down very quickly and there are a few skid
                        marks indicating that some needed to brake quickly to avoid a rear-end collision.

                o       Harvest traffic (semi's and grain sized trucks) were observed in the study area, this additional
                        truck traffic added to the safety concerns and delays on US 14B.

                o       Many vehicles turning from US 14B onto the stadium access roadways caused delays or
                        required US 14B users to stop and wait for the turning vehicles. Some US 14B users would
                        pass the turning vehicles on the shoulder of the roadway.

            9:10 to 9:45 pm observation on 6 Street

                 o      The uniformity of the lights along Medary Avenue need improvement, lights exist but there
                        are dark locations and cause concern for pedestrians crossing at night or during the evening
                        hours.

                 o      Currently, no lighting exists on US 14B at either Stadium Road or 16th Avenue. When the
                        stadium grounds clear after the game vehicles entering US 14B have a difficult time judging
                        traffic that is traveling along US 14B. I observed many vehicles turning onto the highway
                        causing the US 14B users to slow down to avoid rear end collisions.

CITY   OF   BROOKINGS

  CITY    OF   AURORA

B R O O K I N G S C O U N TY
                           Street Design Standards
                              City of Brookings


 I.    Relation to existing plans and ordinances

       These Design Standards serve to implement the goals and objectives of
       community planning efforts undertaken by the City of Brookings, as
       authorized under the laws of the State of South Dakota. The Design
       Standards are intended to preserve and protect the health, safety and
       welfare of Brookings' citizens.

       General community goals and objectives are stated in the latest edition of
       the Comprehensive Plan (Vision 2020). Subdivision improvements are
       addressed in Chapter 51 of the Code of Ordinances and these Design
       Standards govern transportation aspects of those subdivision
       improvements. Chapter 66 establishes the Comprehensive Plan and
       Major Streets Plan, while other aspects of street development are covered
       in Chapter 94.

II.    Functional classification

       Street-level transportation needs are best met by providing a complete
       array of street types, from high-speed, high-volume Interstate and
       expressway routes to low-speed, low-volume local streets. Higher volume
       roadways are usually well-spaced, while lower volume roadways form a
       dense network of neighborhood streets. The classification of Brookings'
       roadways is shown in the Major Streets Plan (Figure 1). The street types
       include:
           · Major Arterial ­ highest volume routes serving inter-city and intra-
              city traffic
           · Minor Arterial ­ middle volume routes serving primarily intra-city
              traffic
           · Major Collector ­ middle volume routes connecting local streets
              with arterial streets
           · Minor Collector ­ lower volume routes connecting local streets with
              arterial streets
           · Local Street ­ low volume routes serving neighborhood traffic.
       The street classification is also reflected in access and design provisions
       of these Design Standards.

III.   Access controls

       The safety and efficiency of urban roadways is largely dependent on the
       density, location and design of access points, both intersections and
       driveways. Urban street systems are well managed by application of
appropriate controls on roadway access. Access controls for the City of
Brookings are detailed below.

   a. Route classification ­ the functional classification, as shown in the
      Major Streets Plan, serves to classify the street system for access
      as well as other standards. State highway routes (Interstate 29, US
      14, US 14B) have been classified by the South Dakota Department
      of Transportation and are governed by State law and South Dakota
      Administrative Rule 70:09.
   b. Access spacing ­ spacing of new access points onto the various
      street types shall be governed by Table 1. Table 1 shall also
      govern other access-related measures as shown in the table.

      Table 1 ­ Access Standards
      Functional          Minimum               Minimum               Minimum
      Class               Access                Signal Spacing        Median
                          Spacing                                     Opening
                                                                      Spacing
      Major Arterial      1320' full            1320'                 660'
                          access
                          660' partial
                          access
      Minor Arterial      330' full access      1320'                 N/A
      Major Collector     See Note 1            See Note 2            N/A
      Minor Collector     See Note 1            See Note 2            N/A
      Local Street        See Note 1            See Note 2            N/A
             Note 1: One access per residential or commercial lot with shared
             accesses determined by development review on commercial lots and
             access prohibited within the intersection influence area of arterial street
             intersections.
             Note 2: Traffic signal control will only be used on collector and local
             streets at arterial street intersections or for special uses as determined
             by the City Engineer.

      All legally permitted access points existing at the time of adoption of
      these Design Standards are accepted without prejudice. Access
      spacing standards will be applied during review of all development
      proposals. Access spacing in variance to Table Y on routes in
      previously-developed areas may be accepted if a review of land
      ownership, zoning and road conditions determines that no other
      feasible access is available to the property in question.

      When a property has frontage onto two or more streets, access
      from only the lower classified street will be deemed appropriate and
      sufficient.

      Access on routes under the jurisdiction of the South Dakota
      Department of Transportation will be determined according to rules
      and procedures instituted by the State of South Dakota.
         c. Permits ­ an access permit will be required for any proposal for a
            new driveway or intersection onto the City arterial or collector street
            system coming from outside of City government. Permit
            applications will be available from the City Engineer's office and
            must be completed, submitted and approved prior to construction of
            the driveway or intersection. A permit will not be deemed as
            completed until any supporting documents required by the City
            Engineer are supplied.
         d. Access studies ­ detailed transportation analyses may be needed
            to determine proper access onto the City roadway system.

            The City Engineer may require a traffic impact study for any non-
            residential development proposal expected to produce more than
            100 peak hour vehicle trips or for any residential development with
            150 or more dwelling units. (See Table 2) Preparation of the report
            shall be the responsibility of the developer and shall be prepared by
            a licensed design professional with experience in transportation
            planning. The City will review submitted draft traffic impact studies
            and provide comments in written form. The developer and design
            professional will have the opportunity to revise the report prior to
            final submittal. All study reports must be reviewed by the City
            before acceptance. The traffic impact study will provide information
            for the City's decision on any access permit and will be prepared in
            compliance with procedures available from the City Engineer. Any
            roadway or traffic control improvements recommended by the traffic
            impact study to maintain roadway safety and efficiency will be
            funded by the developer.

           The City may also engage in transportation planning studies, either
           alone or in conjunction with the South Dakota Department of
           Transportation, which will determine future access locations on
           portions of the roadway system. Such transportation planning
           studies will be conducted with public input and presented to the City
           Council for adoption.
        e. Driveway design ­ driveways onto the City street system shall meet
           standards established by ordinance or subsequent standard
           adopted by the City Engineer's office. Pertinent information is
           available from the City Engineer's office.
IV.   General roadway design
        a. Vertical alignment
                i. Changing grades ­ the use of grade breaks, in lieu of vertical
                   curves, is not encouraged. However, grade breaks with an
                   algebraic difference in grade not exceeding eight-tenths
                   (0.008ft/ft) will be permitted if necessary.

                  ii. Vertical curves ­ must comply with AASHTO standards.
                      Vertical curves shall be used when the algebraic difference
                      in grade (A) equals or exceeds eight-tenths (0.008 ft/ft). All
                      vertical curves shall be labeled on profile with length of curve
                      (L) and K (defined as L/A).
iii. Intersection criteria
         1. The grade of the "through" street shall take
            precedence at intersections. At intersections of
            roadways with the same classification, the more
            important roadway, as determined by the City
            Engineer, shall have precedence.
         2. The elevation at the end of the curb return on the
            through street is always set by the grade of the
            through street in conjunction with normal pavement
            cross-slope.
         3. Carrying the crown of the side street into the through
            street is not permitted.
         4. Dipping the flowline to the extent that the lip of the
            gutter is dipped is not permitted, except as specified
            by Standard Plates concerning curb opening inlets.
            Tipping an inlet for the benefit of drainage is also not
            permitted.
         5. More detailed review shall be performed for arterial-
            arterial intersections to maximize driveability.
         6. Flowline profiles and pavement cross-slopes shall be
            shown through an intersection until a normal cross-
            section is obtained. This information shall be
            submitted using a scale of 1"=20' horizontally and
            1"=2' vertically.
         7. Parabolic or curved crowns are not allowed. In no
            case shall the pavement cross-slope at intersections
            exceed the grade of the through street.
         8. The rate of change in pavement cross-slope when
            warping side streets at intersections shall not exceed
            one (1) percent every twenty-five (25) feet horizontally
            on a local roadway, one (1) percent every thirty-seven
            and one-half (37.5) feet horizontally on a collector
            roadway, or one (1) percent every fifty-six and one-
            half (56.5) feet horizontally on arterial roadways.
iv. Curb Returns ­ minimum fall around curb returns shall be
     one-half of one (0.5) percent.
 v. Connection with Existing Roadways
         1. Existing grades shall be shown for a sufficient
            distance to assure that horizontal and vertical curve
            requirements are being or can be met with field-
            verified as-builts showing stations and elevations at
            twenty-five (25) foot intervals. In the case of
            connection with an existing intersection, these as-
            builts are to be shown within a one hundred (100) foot
            radius of the intersection. This information shall be
            included in the plan and profile that shows that
                  proposed roadway. Limits and characteristics of the
                  existing improvement are the primary concern in the
                  plan view. Such characteristics include horizontal
                  alignment, offset intersections, limits of the
                  improvements, etc.
              2. Previously approved designs for the existing
                  improvement are not an acceptable means of
                  establishing existing grades; however, they are to be
                  referenced on the construction plan where they occur.
              3. The basis of the as-built elevations shall be the same
                  as the design elevations (both flowline or both top of
                  curb, etc.) when possible.
b. Horizontal alignment
       i. Any angular break in horizontal alignment of more than two
          (2) degrees shall require a horizontal curve.
      ii. Minimum curb return radius at street intersections shall be
          15'. Curb return radii shall comply with AASHTO standards
          where truck traffic is significant.
     iii. The use of superelevation is discouraged for all streets.
          However, where superelevation is required for curves,
          arterial streets and collector streets, horizontal curve radius
          and superelevation shall be in compliance with AASHTO
          standards. Superelevation shall not be used on local
          roadways. All roadway designs using superelevation are
          subject to review and acceptance by the City Engineer.
     iv. Spiral curves shall not be used on streets within the City
          except on State highways or upon written acceptance of the
          City Engineer.
      v. The following criteria shall be used for the horizontal
          geometry of cul-de-sac turnarounds:
              1. Minimum property line radius: 60.0 feet
              2. Minimum back of curb radius: 42 feet
              3. Maximum length of cul-de-sac measured along
                  centerline between the radius point of the turnaround
                  and the right-of-way line of the abutting street: 600.0
                  feet.
     vi. If lanes are added, deleted, or adjusted, it will be necessary
          to construct a transition section for the safe conveyance of
          traffic. The following formula shall be applied to the taper or
          lane change necessary for this transition:
                  L=WS2/60, where:

                 L=Length of transition in feet
                 W=Width of offset in feet
                 S=Speed limit of 85th percentile speed
c. Grades:
   STREET TYPE              MIN GRADE (%)           MAX GRADE (%)
   ARTERIAL                 0.5                     6.0
   COLLECTOR                0.5                     7.0
   LOCAL                    0.5                     8.0

d. Lane widths ­ standard lane width shall be 11' or 12' for arterial
   streets and 11' for collector streets. Refer to typical design cross-
   sections for more information.
e. Turn lanes ­ turn lanes may be required along segments of arterial
   or collector streets if the proposed development constitutes a
   potential for creating a traffic hazard or unnecessarily impedes
   through-traffic movements as determined by a traffic impact study
   or the City Engineer. A high volume access must be provided with
   a turning lane to allow the driver to maneuver out of the main travel
   lanes before slowing. Left-turn lanes must be provided in the
   center or median of the road for left-turning traffic at a high-volume
   access. Turn lanes may be triggered by application of the volume
   warrants or by capacity analysis of an intersection. Turn lanes
   should be designed according to applicable standards.

f. Parking
       i. Parking lanes will not be allowed on arterial streets. Parking
          lanes may not be allowed on major collector streets.
      ii. Diagonal or perpendicular parking may only be allowed on
          City streets in the Central Business District or by approval of
          the City Engineer.
                  iii. Refer to typical design cross-sections for the orientation of
                       on-street parking.
          g. Medians ­ medians should be constructed on major arterial streets,
              especially those arterial streets with more than 4 through lanes.
              Refer to the typical design cross-sections for the orientation of
              medians.
          h. Intersections
                    i. Standard ­ at-grade 3 and 4-leg intersections should be
                       designed so the intersecting streets meet at a 90-degree
                       angle, or as close thereto as possible, and the interior
                       pavement area of the intersection should be minimized. The
                       lanes should be aligned to allow maximum visibility and
                       positive guidance to the driver. Refer to AASHTO design
                       standards for more information.
                   ii. Roundabout
                          1. Modern roundabout intersections are acceptable for
                              traffic control at appropriate intersections.
                          2. Design of roundabout intersections shall be in
                              accordance with the latest edition of Roundabouts: an
                              Informational Guide, (Federal Highway
                              Administration).
                          3. Modern roundabouts shall be designed to
                              accommodate a WB-67 design vehicle.
                          4. Maximum entry speed for roundabout intersections
                              shall not exceed 25 mph.
          i. Dead-end streets ­ Dead-end streets should be avoided. The City
              Engineer may approve dead-end streets only upon a showing that
              site conditions create an unavoidable need for a dead-end.
              Provision should be made for adequate vehicular turn-around at all
              dead-ends.
 V.    Pedestrian facilities
          a. Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of all roadways
              unless specifically waived by the City Engineer. Refer to the typical
              design cross-sections for sidewalk locations.
          b. Sidewalk features shall be designed to meet the requirements of
              the Americans with Disabilities Act.
VI.    Bicycle facilities
          a. Bicycle facilities should be provided as part of the typical street
              design cross-section as planned in the Brookings Bicycle Plan and
              elsewhere wherever possible.
          b. The current AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle
              Facilities shall be used as a guide for development of all Brookings
              bicycle facilities.
VII.   Drainage
          a. All drainage facilities shall conform to the Technical Criteria Manual
              maintained by the City of Brookings.
           b. Inlets shall be located to intercept the curb flow at the point curb
                flow capacity is exceeded by the storm runoff. Inlets shall also be
                installed to intercept cross-pavement flows at points of transition in
                superelevation. Due to the presence of curb ramps, inlets are not
                allowed in the curb return, but will be located at the tangent points
                of the curb returns. In general, inlets shall be placed on the
                upstream side of the intersection so as to intercept the water before
                it reaches the pedestrian crosswalk.
           c. Except at intersections or where superelevation is required, streets
                in general shall be level from top of curb to top of curb (or flowline
                to flowline) and shall have a one and one-half (1.5) percent to three
                (3) percent crown as measured from centerline to lip of gutter, or lip
                of median gutter to lip of outside curb on roadways with medians.
                Where the crown point is not centered in the street, the crown point
                can be no further out than the quarter point of the street.
           d. Temporary erosion control is required at the ends of all roadways
                that are not completed due to project phasing, subdivision
                boundaries, etc.
           e. Storm water from concentrated points of discharge shall not be
                allowed to flow over sidewalks, but shall drain to the roadway by
                use of storm sewers. Sidewalk chases will not be allowed unless
                specifically approved by the City Engineer. If permitted, sidewalk
                chases shall not be located within driveways.
VIII.   Off-street parking
           a. Parking layouts shall conform to dimensions available from the City
                Engineer. Refer to Ordinances 94-431 through 94-433 for further
                requirements.
           b. Parking spaces should be so arranged that no vehicle will be
                required to be backed into the street in order to exit the lot except
                for single-family or duplex dwelling units.
           c. Parking spaces should be so arranged that no vehicle shall be
                required to back over a public sidewalk in order to exit the stall.
 IX.    Traffic control
           a. Construction work zone traffic shall be controlled by signs,
                barricades, detours, etc., that are designed in accordance with the
                Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), latest edition.
                A traffic control plan shall be submitted to and approved by the City
                Engineer prior to start of any construction.
           b. For construction of new facilities, traffic control should strive to keep
                the motorist from entering the facility through use of temporary
                barricades and signing in advance of the construction area. New
                construction shall not be opened to traffic nor should construction
                traffic control be removed without the approval of the City Engineer.
           c. The details of the traffic control plan must be shown on a map, as-
                built plans or construction plan drawings. Any plan for traffic control
                during construction that indicates a complete closure of an arterial
             or collector street must show detour routes and must be approved
             by the City Engineer. Requirements for rerouting of traffic, signing,
             time of closure, and length of closure, will be determined on a case-
             by-case basis. When a local street is to be closed to traffic, the City
             Engineer must be notified at least 24 hours in advance.
         d. Direction access on roadways may be restricted (minimum travel
             lane width in construction areas is ten (10) feet), but proper controls
             including flagging must be indicated. Removal of on-street parking
             shall be considered and noted where applicable.
         e. Every precaution shall be taken to ensure that construction work
             does not interfere with the movement of pedestrian traffic which
             shall be maintained on the sidewalk at all times with flagmen
             provided for guidance as necessary.
         f. Where an excavation interrupts the continuity of the sidewalk, the
             Contractor shall provide suitable bridge or deck facilities to be
             supplemented by the use of such proper devices and measures as
             prescribed in the MUTCD for the safe and uninterrupted movement
             of pedestrian traffic. The edges or ends of the pedestrian bridge or
             decking shall be beveled or chamfered to a thin edge to prevent
             tripping.
         g. Temporary diversion walkways shall be hard surfaced and electric
             lighting shall be provided and kept continuously burning during
             hours of darkness when required by the City Engineer.
         h. Unless otherwise authorized by the City Engineer, pedestrians shall
             not be channeled to walk on the traveled portion of a roadway.
         i. Under certain conditions, it may be necessary to divert pedestrians
             to the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street. Such crossings
             shall only be made at intersections or marked pedestrian
             crossovers.
         j. Facilities satisfactory to the City Engineer shall be provided for
             pedestrians crossing at corners, pedestrian crossovers, and public
             transportation stops.
X.    Lighting
         a. Design and construction of street lighting shall be coordinated with
             the City Engineer and Brookings Utilities.
XI.   Pavement design
         a. Design of pavement thickness for collector and arterial streets and
             local streets in industrial and commercial zoned areas shall be
             based on AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures, latest
             edition. Pavement design shall be based on an inherent reliability
             of 75 percent. For traffic conditions where the equivalent 18
             kip/single axle loading is less than 1,000,000, the low-volume road
             design method may be used. Recommendations and subgrade
             properties developed by a geotechnical exploration report shall be
             used in the design of the pavement structure.
          b. Industrial and arterial streets must be designed for pavement
             thickness on an individual street-by-street basis. However, in no
             event may the pavement thickness be less than that specified in
             Table Z. Local residential streets need not be designed on an
             individual basis, but must meet the minimum pavement thickness
             as set forth in Table Z.
          c. Minimum compressive strength for Portland Cement concrete
             paving shall be 4000 psi at 28 days.
          d. Where traffic data is available, actual counts shall be used along
             with projections of traffic growth to determine the pavement design.
             If traffic data is not available, Tables 3 and 4 may be used to
             provide data for the pavement design. Traffic data for all arterial
             streets will be determined by the City Engineer. Truck loading shall
             be considered in the design of all Commercial and Arterial Streets.

40   Guide for the Geometric Design of Driveways


                                  calling for smaller dimensions to make crossing the driveway easier for pedestrians, and others
                                  wanting larger dimensions to facilitate motor vehicle ingress and egress.
                                     An operational analysis of the intersection between the driveway and the roadway provides a
                                  basis for decisions regarding the number of driveway lanes. The connection transition and the
                                  driveway width dimensions should complement each other to produce good driveway opera-
                                  tions. The driveway width and the curb radius can perform in concert, so to some degree one
                                  can increase as the other decreases. In other words, a wide driveway can be used together with a
                                  small radius or flare to achieve similar operations to a narrower driveway with a larger radius or
                                  flare. When only one vehicle is expected to be using the driveway at any given time, such as a res-
                                  idential driveway serving a two-car garage, the smaller radii are suitable with the greater widths.

                                            Additional width may be needed if the driveway has a curved horizontal alignment.
                                            For a flare/taper design, use the radius as the dimension of the triangular legs.
                                           For industrial or other driveways frequented by heavy vehicles, consider either a simple curve with a taper
                                                or a 3-centered curve design.
                                            For connection angles greatly different than 90 degrees, check the radius design with turning templates.
                                                For connection corners at which a turn is prohibited, a very small radius is appropriate. Also see the
                                                section, Driveway Horizontal Alignment and Angle.
                                            Driveways crossing an open ditch should have a minimum 2 ft shoulder on each side.

                                             If the roadway has a usable shoulder, a somewhat smaller radius may perform acceptably.

                                  of signal phases) that would not fit into a progression pattern (5-12). The median openings where
                                  U-turns would be made need to be designed to accommodate the additional turning movements.
                                     Requests for a median opening or opposition to closing a median opening may be based on
                                  an assumption that a direct left-turn egress maneuver is preferable to a right turn followed by a
                                  U-turn. However, observations show that drivers often make a right turn followed by a U-turn
                                  where the median opening design permits a direct left turn from a driveway (5-13). The addi-
                                  tional travel distance of turning right and then making a U-turn is offset by travel time savings
                                  by not having to wait for a gap in both directions that is needed for direct, left-turn egress.

                                  Medians in the Driveway
                                     The benefits of restrictive medians in a roadway can also accrue when medians are installed
                                  in driveways. Medians in a driveway may be appropriate where one or more of the following
                                  conditions exists:
                                  ·   The driveway has two or more entrance lanes.
                                  ·   The driveway has two or more exit lanes.
                                  ·   There is a large pavement area that may confuse drivers.
                                  ·   The driveway operates as right-in/right-out, and this may be unclear to some drivers.
                                  ·   The driveway serves a high volume of traffic.
                                  ·   The driveway is or will be signalized.
                                     A median in a driveway that separates the ingress and egress movements is appropriate for
                                  very high-intensity driveways, where the median may provide refuge for pedestrians, separate
                                  the opposing traffic flows, and channelize the traffic movements. Exhibit 5-31 provides guidance
                                  for when a median in a driveway may be beneficial.
                                    The presence of a median will make the overall length of the pedestrian crossing wider.
                                  However, this may be more than offset by the pedestrian refuge effect the median creates in the
                                  middle of the driveway.
                                    Where a driveway median is needed, there are minimum dimensions that apply to avoid hav-
                                  ing a median that is too short and narrow. There is also a possibility that if the median island is
                                  too wide, drivers may mistake one driveway with a median for two separate driveways (5-9, p. 46).

         End      The 2004 AASHTO Green Book states that for a              To fit the wheel path of a
         treatment median island less than 10 ft wide, a semicircular        turning vehicle, per the
                    end shape is adequate. For median island widths of       2004 Green Book
                    10 ft or more, a bullet nose end shape is suggested.     (p.697).
                  From observations, a bullet nose shape may be
                    desirable for widths of less than 10 ft.

   Exhibit 5-32 lists suggested minimum dimensions and presents two versions of bullet nose end
geometry. The half bullet nose provides a larger radius to accommodate the path and offtrack-
ing of a vehicle nearing the end of its left turn. If the stop line and stopped position for vehicles
leaving the site is close to the median nose end, then a lesser radius may be adequate for that move-
ment. Examine the turning paths of left-turning vehicles to ascertain what shape will suffice.

Islands in the Driveway
   Driveway triangular islands (pork chops) can be constructed in the driveway entry throat at
driveway intersections with both divided and undivided roadways to
· Channelize right turns,
· Discourage or prohibit one or both left turns, or

  Exhibit 5-33 illustrates three different scenarios for using islands to discourage left turns.
   A triangular island and an angled driveway can have some design objectives and features in
common. The objectives of either design can include facilitating right turns and discouraging
left turns. With both, the design can attempt to align vehicles at a skewed angle rather than per-
pendicular to the public roadway.
   Exhibit 5-34 shows two schematics for islands to channelize right turns exiting a driveway (5-13).
In the (a) schematic, a flatter entry-angle combined with a larger radius may increase the speed at
which right-turning vehicles leave the driveway. The flatter entry-angle requires the driver's head to
turn a greater number of degrees to the left to monitor oncoming traffic from the left. If the design
evokes a subconscious association with a freeway entry ramp, it could theoretically give the driver a
false sense of a free entry into the through roadway. This arrangement has been criticized for being

Exhibit 5-38.    When to use detectable warning surfaces.


    Advisory R221 Detectable Warning Surfaces. Detectable warning surfaces are
    required where curb ramps, blended transitions, or landings provide a flush
    pedestrian connection to the street. Sidewalk crossings of residential driveways
    should not generally be provided with detectable warnings, since the pedestrian
    right-of-way continues across most driveway aprons and overuse of detectable
    warning surfaces should be avoided in the interests of message clarity. However,
    where commercial driveways are provided with traffic control devices or other-
    wise are permitted to operate like public streets, detectable warnings should be
    provided at the junction between the pedestrian route and the street.

the length of the driveway, one edge may be higher than the other, or the center line may be
higher than the edges, creating driveway cross slope. Where the driveway and sidewalk intersect,
the driveway cross slope is the same as the sidewalk grade.
   In the absence of information specifically developed for driveways, these guidelines have incor-
porated cross slope recommendations from AASHTO. A minimum cross slope of 2% is recom-
mended to provide surface runoff drainage. Where feasible, a maximum cross slope of 8% is
recommended in areas where snow or ice can occur.

Exhibit 5-42 lists suggested minimum allowable intersection angles for driveways.
Driveway Horizontal Alignment
   Past or back from the driveway connection transition area (the intersection with the roadway),
the horizontal alignment (i.e., plan view) of a driveway should be straight, not curved. One rea-
son for this is so the driver of a motor vehicle entering or leaving the driveway does not have the
added task of steering in a compound or reverse or multiple curves, which diverts more atten-
tion from the task of monitoring crossing bicyclists, pedestrians, and vehicles. Another reason is
that a straight alignment makes it easier for drivers to position and align their vehicles as they
approach the intersection and make turning maneuvers and not sideswipe other vehicles. A third
reason is to avoid creating situations where the vehicle exiting the site is unintentionally posi-
tioned at a skew angle to the roadway. Exhibit 5-43 recommends minimum lengths of straight
approaches in advance of the actual physical intersection of a driveway with a roadway.

Space for Bicyclists and Pedestrians
   Motor vehicles are not the only form of traffic traveling perpendicular to the roadway to and
from a traffic generator set back from the roadway. Bicyclists and pedestrians also make these
movements at many locations and, in the absence of a separate facility, they may bike or walk in
the driveway.
   Exhibit 5-44 shows a pedestrian on a gray, overcast day with light rain, forced to walk in the
driveway because of the lack of a sidewalk. At this particular location, the lack of a sidewalk con-
tributes to occasional conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians.

                                    Exhibit 5-45 suggests situations where a separate facility parallel to the driveway may be
                                  needed and where it may be acceptable for the bicyclist or pedestrian to share the driveway with
                                  motor vehicles.


                                  Driveway Edge and Border Treatments
                                     A driveway edge should be clearly defined and visible to all users, so users can ascertain the lat-
                                  eral limits of motor vehicle operation. From observations such as in Exhibit 5-46, a vertical wall
                                  at the edge of a driveway causes drivers to shift their vehicles toward the center line. It is suggested
                                  that no vertical face (e.g., a retaining wall) be within 2 feet of the edge of the intended way for vehi-
                                  cle use. A wider offset must be provided if there will be a sidewalk parallel to the driveway.
Exhibit 5-44. Lack of
a sidewalk forces the                For driveways with flat edges (i.e., no curb) in a fill, drivers will find it harder to determine
pedestrian into the               where the edge is in rain, fog, or darkness. The designer should not place a sudden drop off at such
driveway.                         an edge. A relatively flat shoulder with a minimum width of 2 ft (after any rounding) is suggested
                                  before the side slopes downward. Some property owners install reflectors or other similar devices
                                  at the edge to help deal with this problem.
                                     As shown in Exhibit 5-47a, the toe of a slope should not extend to the base of a driveway
                                  or sidewalk edge, because runoff and erosion can lead to a mud-covered driveway or sidewalk
                                  surface. Exhibit 5-47b shows the toe of the slope recessed from the pavement edge, a method
                                  which yields better results.


                                  Edge Clearance from Fixed Objects
                                    Fixed objects such as utility poles, fire hydrants, and drainage inlets should be set back from
                                  the edge of the driveway and from the edge of the roadway. Reasons for this include allowing

  Given that one of the underlying factors to consider is the driveway volume, both entering and
exiting vehicles during the peak time period, it may be necessary to estimate likely driveway usage
before designing the length of the driveway throat.

Design Suggestions
   The throat length must be long enough to avoid internal site conflicts associated with cross-
ing or weaving movements. It also must be adequate to avoid spillback onto the public road or
internal circulation system. There are different controls:
1. Designing sufficient length to react to conflicts,
2. Designing sufficient length to accommodate traffic queues, and
3. Designing sufficient length to accommodate weaving.
   Different sources have developed different approaches for establishing minimum throat
lengths. The following narrative presents the approaches from various sources.

  Koepke and Levinson Throat Length. When more detailed, site-specific information is
available, one could apply the recommendations by Koepke and Levinson in NCHRP Report 348
(5-20). For signalized driveways, suggested on-site throat lengths (per lane) were based on the
equation N = 2qr, where
  N = number of cars to store,
  q = vehicles per hour per lane, and
   r = effective red time per cycle.
  Alternative guidelines were cited based on the number of parking spaces per exit lane for
multi-family, residential, retail, office, and industrial uses. The following suggested guidelines
were based on both sets of criteria:
· 50 feet for minor driveways that serve 50 to 100 apartments, less than 50,000 square feet of
  retail, or a quality restaurant;
· 150 feet, with at least two exit lanes, for shopping centers of up to 700,000 square feet, and
  office complexes up to 500,000 square feet; and
· 200 feet or more, with at least two exit lanes, for larger commercial complexes.

   Stover and Keopke Throat Length. In Transportation and Land Development, Stover and
Koepke (5-13, p. 7­28) state that the exit condition controls the throat length for high-volume
traffic generators, while the entry condition controls the throat length for low-volume traffic
generators. The exit side of a driveway should be designed to enable traffic to efficiently leave a
site. The throat length and cross section are interrelated: the wider the cross section, the longer
the exit throat length needed to accommodate the associated weaving maneuvers. Exhibit 5-55
presents the minimum throat length for stop-controlled and for signalized-access drives, based
on the number of egress or exit lanes.

   The study led to the suggestions following in Exhibit 5-68. Except where noted, these guide-
lines are based on observations of passenger vehicles (P-vehicle).
   Where low-clearance vehicles are expected to traverse crest curves, refer to Exhibit 5-69 devel-
oped by Eck and Kang (5-26) that suggests vertical curve lengths for various breakover angles
(i.e., algebraic difference in grades).

Drainage Control
  Surface runoff from the roadway should not inundate the sidewalk or spill over onto private
property. It is also undesirable for the depth of flow to cover the driveway, making it difficult for
motorists to determine were the edges of the driveway are.

                                    Business signs may be present outside of the roadway right-of-way, along driveways, or within
                                  parking areas. These signs should be placed so that they do not compete with traffic signs or
                                  obstruct sight lines of the various users.
                                     Along a busy roadway, a business sign may help identify a driveway location. If placed close to the
                                  driveway, a sign can help motorists who are scanning the upcoming roadside to detect the location
                                  of the driveway they are searching for. Conversely, a business sign located far from the driveway may
                                  actually divert a motorist's view from the driveway location and be misleading and confusing.


                                  Auxiliary Right-Turn Lanes
                                     Right-turn deceleration lanes are frequently constructed to remove the slower right-turning
                                  vehicles from the through travel lanes when right-turn volumes into a driveway are heavy and/or
                                  could have a significant adverse effect on through traffic. The benefits that accrue from having
                                  right-turn lanes include increased capacity, reduced speed differentials and brake applications,
                                  and reduced rear-end collisions.
1. Railroad Overpass Policy.

The City of Brookings has many streets that cross railroad facilities. The
majority of these crossings are at-grade, where the transportation facility and the
railroad facility are at the same elevation. The remainder of the crossings are
grade-separated, where the transportation facility and the railroad facility are
separated by a bridge or an underpass. The grade-separated crossings provide a
continuous flow for the transportation facility (includes both vehicles and
pedestrians), reduce conflicts with the railroad facility, and increase safety for the
rail facility and the transportation facility. The City of Brookings encourages
grade-separated crossings whenever economically and spatially feasible.

Other communities in surrounding states, various State Departments of
Transportation, and the Federal Highway Administration have been consulted on
what policies and guiding objectives they use to determine the needs for
grade-separated crossings. The majority of these agencies indicated they do not
follow an "official" grade-separation policy, but construct them when feasible due
to safety and pedestrian/traffic flow.

The following Evaluation Process is used by the City of Brookings when
evaluating the need for a grade-separated crossing. These factors, combined
with engineering design criteria, and financial and spatial considerations are
essential in determining the need for a grade-separated crossing.

1.1 Design Criteria for a Grade-Separated Crossing.

A grade-separated crossing should be considered when one or more of the
following criteria exist:

       1. The roadway is designated as an arterial street on the Major Street
       Plan.
       2. The roadway design speed is at least 45 mph.
       3. The roadway has a projected average annual daily traffic (AADT) that
       exceeds 10,000 vehicles per day.
       4. The rail line has a design speed of at least 49 mph.
       5. The rail line carries an average of three or more trains per day at the
       location under consideration.

The analysis of all relevant factors identified below should be completed
when a location meets one or more of the above-listed design criteria.

1.2 Analysis of Factors.

Five factors commonly used to analyze a grade-separated crossing are
safety, vehicle and pedestrian accessibility, street connectivity, driver delay,
and train noise. These factors are indirectly related to the above design
criteria and are all considered the same priority in the analysis. The
information below should be analyzed and considered to determine if a
grade-separated crossing is a better choice than an at-grade crossing.

1. Safety

Safety brings forth much emotion, publicity, and urgency. Vehicle-train
crashes, while infrequent, do occur at at-grade crossings and can
cause severe injuries and fatalities. Safety is a critical factor to be
considered when evaluating possible grade-separated crossing
locations.

2. Vehicle and Pedestrian Accessibility

In some areas, it may be relatively easy to bypass an at-grade
crossing that is occupied by a train by accessing the nearest
grade-separated crossing. In the urban core of Brookings, there are
multiple local and arterial streets that provide an alternative if a
crossing is blocked, although at times the nearby streets could also be
occupied by a train.

However, in the newer areas of the city, the philosophy of constructing
multiple crossings has changed due to the Rail Authority design
objectives of reducing crossing conflicts, improving safety, and costs of
crossing construction and maintenance. Therefore, crossings occur
mainly at arterial streets and may be a mile or more apart. In these
locations, the time to bypass the at-grade crossing may actually be
longer than the time it takes to wait for the train. This accessibility is an
important factor when considering a grade-separated crossing.
3. Street Connectivity

Roadways with grade-separated crossings connect major trip
generators (commuters) to employment centers within a community.
These roadway facilities tend to be a higher classification such as
arterials and expressways because their main function is mobility
versus access to a public right-of-way.

It is important to locate the grade-separated crossing at locations
where they will receive the highest usage because of the increased
construction costs of a grade-separated crossing versus an at-grade
crossing.

4. Driver Delay

It is generally recognized that user costs are incurred by drivers waiting
for trains at an at-grade crossing. However, that is not the only user
cost which may result from delaying drivers at rail crossings. The time
it takes for a train to pass can be life threatening to a trauma victim on
the way to an emergency room. Therefore, it is important to include the
full range of social costs associated with delay at at-grade crossings
when looking at delay as a factor in a grade-separated crossing.

5. Train Noise

Train and train whistle horn noise are a significant quality-of-life issue
for many communities. The human voice cannot be heard over the
noise of a train horn. Phone calls and conversations can be interrupted
by the train noise, which may have an impact to property values.
Measures, such as banning horn blowing, would create obvious safety
concerns and are not supported by the Rail Authority. If an at-grade
crossing is replaced with a grade-separated crossing, the need to blow
a horn for the crossing is eliminated. Therefore, it is imperative to
consider concerns about noise as a factor in a grade-separated
crossing.

Consideration of establishing a Whistle Free Zone as described in the
Federal Rail Authority (FRA) Regulations also needs to be considered as
part of the evaluation. This process is lengthy and would need to be
approved by the FRA and Local Rail Authority. Typically, this process would
evaluate multiple crossings in an area to show a benefit to the surrounding
land uses.

In addition, if an at-grade crossing is determined to be the most feasible
crossing type, additional crossing improvements are required at each
location and include: the installation of crossing gates and arms, the
installation of a center median in the arterial street for a minimum of 110 feet
back from the rail crossing, signal crossing lights, protected and signed
pedestrian crossings. These costs are generally the responsibility of the
agency requesting the rail crossing.

RE: 6th Street configuration

We have noted a number of public comments about the configuration of the intersection of 6th Street/25th
Avenue as part of the preparation of the Brookings Area Master Transportation Plan. The intersection has
also been identified as a location with a cluster of crashes and the need for a more standard intersection
configuration.

There have also been discussions in the past about realigning 25th Avenue and/or Sunrise Ridge Road to
create a single intersection.
In light of the intersection concerns, the possible realignment, and the upcoming 6th Street reconstruction, we
have considered a number of options for realignment of streets in the vicinity of 6th St./25th Avenue. The
options include:
        ·   Provide back-to-back ¾ intersections at 6th/Sunrise and 6th/25th.
        ·   Realign 25th Avenue to intersect with the existing Sunrise Ridge Road.
        ·   Extend 25th Avenue to the south to intersect with Minnesota Drive. The south frontage road would
            also be realigned and traffic from Sunrise Ridge Road would be able to reach 6th Street via Minnesota
            Drive and the 25th Avenue extension.
Each of these options has advantages and disadvantages as detailed below.
Twin ¾ intersections:
The short distance between these two intersections (about 390') would make it difficult to provide the
necessary transition and storage lengths for the left turn lanes. This configuration would also require that the
left turn bays serve u-turn movements and that drivers negotiate across two thru lanes to make a u-turn. For
these reasons, this option was not carried further.
Realign 25th Ave. to meet Sunrise Ridge Road:
This configuration provides even signal spacing between 22nd Avenue and Interstate 29 and the potential for a
fairly standard intersection. It would however, have direct right-of-way impacts on 6 properties and secondary
impacts on several more properties, including the isolation of the two motels adjacent to I-29.
Extend 25th Ave. to intersect with Minnesota Drive:
This option retains the existing short distance between 25th Avenue and I-29, but only directly impacts two
properties. No parcels are isolated under this option.


Recommendation
The 25th Ave. extension to Minnesota Drive appears to provide reasonable service without extensive property
impacts and is recommended for consideration during scoping and design of the 6th Street reconstruction
project. It may serve as a short-term solution until such time that the I-29 southbound ramps are signalized
and the short intersection spacing becomes a greater problem. Narrowing the median or providing offset left
turn bays on 6th Street may be advisable to provide greater visibility and positive guidance for drivers.
Graphical layouts of the realignment and extension options are provided in the attached figure.

RE: Interstate 29 analysis

This technical memorandum summarizes our analysis of several alternatives for dealing with future
congestion related to the Interstate 29 access points within the Master Plan study area. Additional Interstate
access has been the subject of several previous studies, with the Brooking Industrial Park Traffic Impact
Study (HDR) finding that an additional overpass on 20th Street South would provide relief for expected
congestion on 6th Street, and the recent Decennial Interstate Corridor Study (FHU) finding that a folded
diamond interchange at 20th Street South could be feasibly constructed. There has also been previous
discussion of adding ramps to the existing overpass at 32nd Street South. This analysis updates previous
analysis with the most recent traffic forecasts and understanding developed as part of the Master
Transportation Plan. It may provide introductory information for, but will not replace, the required Interchange
Justification Report and Environmental Assessment that must be prepared before Interstate access can be
changed.

Forecast ADT volumes and peak hour levels of service have been provided for the alternatives discussed
below. The volumes and levels of service are shown on the attached figures.

Alternative 1 ­ 2035 Volumes, No Improvements

This alternative shows service problems at several locations on the local street system, particularly at the 6th
Street/22nd Avenue intersection in the PM peak hour. Review of a SimTraffic simulation for this alternative
shows severe queue problems propagating from the 6th/22nd intersection in all directions and blocking the I-29
ramp terminals. Queues also extend down the I-29 exit ramps onto the mainline in both directions.

Alternative 2 ­ 2035 Volumes, Intersection Improvements Only

While improving the intersections on 6th Street provides considerable congestion relief, there are still some
potential problems. Simulation shows queue backups that affect the ramp terminals in some, but not all, runs.
Note that the 6th/22nd intersection has been improved to provide double left turn lanes, two through-lanes, and
one right-turn lane on each approach for this alternative. Additional improvements with the greatest affect on
queue backups would involve more than two left turn lanes.

Alternative 3 ­ 2035 Volumes, with 20th Street South Overpass

This alternative shows queues reduced to the point that no impact on Interstate off-ramps is produced. A
portion of the traffic traveling to/from the Industrial Park is diverted, improving network travel time.

Alternative 4 ­ 2035 Volumes, with 20th Street South Interchange

Providing an interchange at 20th Street South has the greatest effect on traffic traveling to/from the industrial
park. Operations on 6th Street are greatly improved and queues have been minimized.

Alternative 5 ­ 2035 Volumes, with 32nd Street South Interchange
This alternative provides the least diversion of Industrial Park traffic, compared to Alternatives 3, 4 and 6.
Congestion on 6th Street is somewhat similar to Alternative 2, with the potential for queue interference with the
Interstate ramp terminal operations.
Alternative 6 ­ 2035 Volumes, with 32nd Street South Interchange and 20th Street South Overpass
The combination of a full interchange on Interstate 29 at 32nd Street South and an overpass at 20th Street
South produces congestion relief on 6th Street greater than either the 32nd Street South interchange or the
20th Street South overpass, but less than a full interchange at 20th Street South. Network queues appear to
be well-managed and don't impact Interstate ramp operation.
NOTE: Alternatives 3 ­ 6 include intersection improvements developed in Alternative 2
Conclusion
Of the alternatives examined in this analysis, Alternative 4 appears to provide the greatest congestion relief
and do the most to alleviate potential problems with Interstate operations.

                                              TRAFFIC COMMITTEE

                     MESSAGE TO VISITORS, DELEGATIONS AND CITIZENS

The Traffic Committee is composed of seven Troy citizens who have volunteered their time to
the City to be involved in traffic and safety concerns. The stated role of this Committee is:

        a.      To give first hearing to citizens' requests and obtain their input.

        b.     To make recommendations to the City Council based on technical considerations,
               traffic surveys, established standards, and evaluation of citizen input.

        c.     To identify hazardous locations and recommend improvements to reduce the
               potential for traffic accidents.

Final decisions on sidewalk waivers will be made by the Committee at this meeting.

The recommendations and conclusions arrived at on regular items this evening will be
forwarded to the City Council for their final action.       Any citizen can discuss these
recommendations before City Council. The items discussed at the Traffic Committee meeting
will be placed on the City Council Agenda by the City Manager. The earliest date these items
might be considered by City Council would normally be 10 days to 2 weeks from the Traffic
Committee meeting. If you are interested, you may wish to contact the City Manager's Office in
order to determine when a particular item is on the Agenda.

Persons wishing to speak before this Committee should attempt to hold their remarks to no
more than 5 minutes. Please try to keep your remarks relevant to the subject at hand. Please
speak only when recognized by the Chair. These comments are made to keep this meeting
moving along. Anyone wishing to be heard will be heard; we are here to listen and help in
solving or resolving your particular concerns.

3. Request for Traffic Control ­ Ellenboro at Trombley

Jason Dalbec of 546 Trombley requests that the existing traffic control at the intersection of
Ellenboro and Trombley be changed to a 4-Way Stop. Mr. Dalbec states that lack of Stop signs
in all directions creates a hazardous situation.

      SUGGESTED RESOLUTIONS:

        a.          RESOLVED, that the intersection of Ellenboro and Trombley be modified to All-Way
                    Stop control.

        b.          RESOLVED, that NO changes be made at the intersection of Ellenboro at Trombley.

4. Request for No Parking Zone ­ Brentwood at Northfield Parkway

The Northfield Hills Condominium Association (NHCA) requests that the south side of
Brentwood, from 15' west of the existing fire hydrant to the intersection at Northfield Parkway, be
posted as a No Parking zone. Mr. John Ballantine, Liaison to the City of Troy with NHCA,
discussed the issue with Traffic Engineering on October 1, 2013.

SUGGESTED RESOLUTIONS:

      a.            RESOLVED, that a No Parking Zone be established on the south side of Brentwood,
                    from 15' west of the existing fire hydrant to the intersection at Northfield Parkway.

      b.            RESOLVED, that NO changes be made on Brentwood.

3. Request for Sidewalk Waiver ­ 675 Vanderpool

Item #3 and #4 were addressed at the same time by the petitioner and the Committee.

Mike Johnson spoke at the meeting and reiterated his request for a waiver of the sidewalk
required at 675 Vanderpool. Mr. Johnson stated that there is no existing sidewalk on
Vanderpool and that it would not connect to any other sidewalk. The location of the new
house is not in close proximity to a major road, so the likelihood of sidewalks connecting to
a major road sidewalk in the future is very unlikely.

                                                                                   Page 1 of 6

The Traffic Committee did receive an email in support of granting a waiver from Diane
Stewart a resident and owner on Vanderpool.

Mr. Ziegenfelder reiterated his support for sidewalks at all locations in the City.

Mr. Kilmer stated that there are too many trees that would be affected by construction of a
sidewalk.

General discussion of the sidewalk waiver process followed.

There were no other members of the public that made comments.

RESOLUTION # 2013-08-15

Moved by Kilmer
Seconded by Halsey

WHEREAS, City of Troy Ordinances, Chapter 34, allows the Traffic Committee to grant
waivers of the City of Troy Design Standards for Sidewalks upon a demonstration of
necessity; and

WHEREAS, Mike Johnson has requested a waiver of the requirement to construct
sidewalk due to the fact that there is no existing sidewalk on Vanderpool and it would not
connect to any other sidewalk ; and

WHEREAS, the Traffic Committee has determined the following:

   a. A waiver will not impair the public health, safety or general welfare of the
      inhabitants of the City and will not unreasonably diminish or impair established
      property values within the surrounding area, and

   b. A strict application of the requirements to construct a sidewalk would result in
      practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the owners, and

   c. The construction of a new sidewalk would lead nowhere and connect to no other
      walk, and thus will not serve the purpose of a pedestrian travel-way.

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Traffic Committee grants a waiver of the
sidewalk requirement for 675 Vanderpool contingent upon the execution of an "Agreement
for Irrevocable Petition for Sidewalk".

YES:         4 (Brandstetter, Halsey, Kilmer, Petrulis)

SUBJECT:                                      Request for Traffic Control
                                              Ellenboro at Trombley

Background:

Jason Dalbec of 546 Trombley requests that the existing traffic control at the intersection of Ellenboro and
Trombley be changed to All-way Stop control. Mr. Dalbec states that lack of Stop signs in all directions creates
a hazardous situation.

There are currently Stop signs on the northbound and southbound approaches along Ellenboro Drive. The
Traffic Committee reviewed this intersection at their meeting of November 19, 2008 and recommended that the
existing Yield signs be replaced with Stop signs (minutes of the meeting are attached). Additional "Cross
Traffic Does Not Stop" plaques were added to the Stop signs more recently.

24-hour traffic volumes were collected by our traffic engineering consultant, OHM, on August 15 and 16.
Turning movement counts were collected with school in session for the arrival and dismissal periods on
October 3. The Average Daily Traffic (ADT) on Trombley is approximately 1,200 vehicles per day (vpd) with
Ellenboro at approximately 650 vpd. The highest peak hour volumes (including pedestrians) along each road
are 112 for Trombley and 136 on Ellenboro. Based on peak hour volumes alone, the option of multi-way Stop
control does not meet warrants as the peak hour volumes do not exceed 300 vehicles in a single hour.

There have been no crashes recorded in the past three (3) years at the intersection.

The posted speed limit on both streets is 25 mph.

The primary sight distance obstruction at the intersection is in the northwest quadrant and is a row of three
evergreen trees, which come into play when determining the safe approach speeds. The safe approach speed
on Ellenboro was calculated to be 7.5 mph. Therefore, Stop signs on Ellenboro are the recommended
treatment.

The city requested that OHM review the request and provide their findings and recommendations (copy
attached).

Recommendation:

Recommend that the intersection control be kept as is with Stop signs on the Ellenboro approaches to the
intersection.

5.      Install Stop Signs on Ellenboro at Trombley

Kari Messina, 3302 Mirage, has requested that the YIELD signs on Ellenboro at Trombley be
replaced by STOP signs. She and her neighbors are concerned for the safety of students walking
to Wattles Elementary School, and also for the middle-schoolers who wait for the school bus at that
corner. There are no sidewalks in the area, and the residents feel that making traffic come to a
complete stop at the corner would improve safety. Our consultants recommend no changes at the
intersection (see attached report).

Gary Abithiera, 3201 Mirage, is concerned about safety because in winter it's dark and often icy
when the children are walking to school and to the bus stop.

Kathleen Novetsky 3289 Mirage, said that Wattles Elementary School is the only one in Troy
without a 4-way STOP near it. She mentioned that this Ellenboro/Trombley intersection is offset,
not completely straight, which makes it trickier to maneuver. She also reports that motorists use
Trombley as a cut-through between Rochester Road and Big Beaver.

Mike Messina, 3302 Mirage, would like all-way STOP signs at this intersection. He thinks there is
too long a stretch of Trombley without any STOP signs to slow down traffic. MMUTCD does not
recommend the use of STOP signs to slow traffic.

Mr. Schepke reported that two of his friends who live near the intersection support installation of
STOP signs instead of the YIELD signs.

Mr. Halsey believes the schools need to educate the children about safety while walking to school.
He has seen the kids walking on both sides and the middle of the street. Lt. Livingston will contact
the school regarding a safety program for students who walk to school.

October 2, 2013

TO:                                                         Traffic Committee

FROM:                                                       Bill Huotari, Deputy City Engineer/ Traffic Engineer

SUBJECT:                                                    Brentwood at Northfield Parkway
                                                            No Parking Zone

Background:

The Northfield Hills Condominium Association (NHCA) requests that the south side of Brentwood
from 15' west of the existing fire hydrant to the intersection at Northfield Parkway be posted as a No
Parking zone. Mr. John Ballantine, Liaison to the City of Troy with NHCA, discussed the issue with
Traffic Engineering on October 1, 2013.

Vehicles parking near the intersection obstruct vehicular movements and create a hazardous
situation. Larger vehicles such as garbage trucks, UPS or FedEx delivery trucks, etc. have difficulties
navigating the turn when a vehicle or vehicles are parked in this area.

Parked vehicles can also obscure a driver's view of pedestrians/bikers crossing the intersection.

During the winter months, snow creeping into the pavement area exacerbates the issues as there is
less road width available to traverse the intersection.

Recommendations:

Recommend that a NO PARKING zone be established on the south side of Brentwood, from a point
approximately 15' west of the existing fire hydrant to Northfield Parkway.

                             TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS

I. INTRODUCTION

This report summarizes traffic impacts related to the proposed Gateway Park. The
general goals of this impact study concentrate on 1) the assessment of existing roadway
conditions and intersection congestion, 2) forecasts of newly generated project traffic, 3)
estimations of future delay, and 4) recommendations for mitigation. Preliminary tasks
include the detailed collection of roadway information, road improvement information,
and peak hour traffic counts. A level of service analysis for existing traffic conditions is
then made to determine the present degree of intersection congestion. Based on this
analysis, forecasts of future traffic levels on the surrounding street system are found.
Following this forecast, the future service levels for the key intersections are investigated.
As a final step, applicable conclusions and possible on-site or off-site mitigation
measures are defined. The findings of this study are intended to ensure safe and efficient
progression of vehicular/non-motorist traffic near the site.


II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The proposed project is a park of approximately 39 acres that will have a mix of active
and passive uses, although specific uses are not determined at this time. The site is
located on the north side of SR-302 just west of the intersection with Creviston Drive in
the Key Peninsula area of unincorporated Pierce County, parcel #'s 0122153701 and
0122164701. The 360 Park is located just to the west of the site. One project access is to
be provided onto SR-302. In addition, as part of the park development the trail access for
360 Park will be routed through Gateway Park and continuing through an easement on the
adjacent Manke Timber Company property. This easement is shown in a figure at the
beginning of the appendix. Other land uses surrounding the site are mostly residential or
undeveloped land. A fire station is located across the street and is a potential tie in point
for the project access. The chosen horizon year is 2018 for a 5 year outlook. Figure 1
shows the site location and the primary arterials. The park parcels are shown in Figure 2.
As the specific park uses and access location are not finalized, a site plan is not provided.


III. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A. Surrounding Roadways

The street network serving the proposed project consists of a variety of roadways. Streets
near the site mainly consist of two-lane arterials. Characteristics for these roadways vary
with respect to lane widths, grades, speeds, and function. Differences are based on
specific designations and proximity to major employment areas in the region. The major
roadways and arterials surrounding the site are listed and described on page 6.

                                              3
SR-302 is a two-lane, east-west designated state highway that borders the south side of
the project. Widening for a left turn lane is provided at the intersection with Creviston
Drive, and as a two-way left turn lane continuing to the east. The posted speed limit near
the site is 45 mph, transitioning to 40 mph to the east. Shoulders are generally paved and
range from 4 to 10 feet wide. Grades are level to rolling with slopes in the 0 to 3 percent
range. Lane widths are around 12 feet and paving is asphalt concrete.

Creviston Drive SW is an north-east to south-west, two-lane roadway that lies to the south
of the site with a posted speed limit of 35 mph. Lane widths are generally 11 feet in
width. Grades along this roadway are between 0 to 3 percent. Shoulders are paved or
grass/gravel.

B. Roadway Improvements

The 2013 - 2018 Pierce County Six-Year Road Program reveals no improvement projects
are planned in the vicinity of the site.

A review of the WSDOT projects list indicates that SR-302 is planned for improvements
for the corridor from the Key Peninsula Highway to Purdy. Improvements may include
lane widening, turn lanes, shoulder widening, and access consolidation. Construction
may begin in 2014, with a listed cost of $6.5 million.

Additionally, WSDOT is reviewing alternatives in a SR-302 corridor study, in which the
SR-302 route from SR-16 to Key Peninsula Highway may be altered from the existing
circuitous route. Several of the alternative routes would place the SR-302 corridor to the
north of the Gateway Park site, which would reduce through volumes across the site
frontage.

C. Peak Hour Volumes

Weekday PM peak hour field data for this study was taken in April of 2012. Although it
is over a year old, this count could be considered to be current, since WSDOT data
indicates flat to negative growth on SR-302 in the vicinity. Evening traffic counts were
taken during the peak period between the hours of 4 PM and 6 PM. This specific peak
period was targeted for analysis purposes since it generally represents a worst case
scenario for developments with respect to traffic conditions. This is primarily due to the
common 8 AM to 5 PM work schedule and the greater number of personal trips occurring
after work hours. Most commuters return to their dwellings at the same time of day
which translates to a natural peak in intersection traffic loads, especially when combined
with the relatively large number of personal trips. Figure 3 on the following page shows
the weekday PM peak volumes for the key intersection of SR-302/Creviston Road.




                                             6
D. Level of Service

Existing peak hour delays were determined through the use of the Highway Capacity
Manual. Capacity analysis is used to determine level of service (LOS) which is an
established measure of congestion for transportation facilities. LOS is defined for a
variety of facilities including intersections, freeways, arterials, etc. The methodology for
determining the LOS at signalized intersections strives to determine the volume to
capacity (/c) ratios for the various intersection movements as well as the average control
delay for those movements. Delay is generally used to measure the degree of driver
discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and lost time. Control delay, in particular,
includes movements at slower speeds and stops on intersection approaches as vehicles
move up in queue position or slow down upstream of an intersection. Aside from the
overall quantity of traffic, three specific factors influence signalized intersection LOS.
These include the type of signal operation provided, the signal phasing pattern, and the
specific allocation of green time.

The methodology for determining the LOS at unsignalized intersections strives to
determine the potential capacities for the various vehicle movements and ultimately
determines the average total delay for each movement. Potential Capacity represents the
number of additional vehicles that could effectively utilize a particular movement, which
is essentially the equivalent of the difference between the movement capacity and the
existing movement volume. Total delay is described as the elapsed time from when a
vehicle stops at the end of a queue until the vehicle departs from the stop line. Average
total delay is simply the mean total delay over the entire stream. A number of factors
influence potential capacity and total delay including the availability/usefulness of gaps.
The range for intersection level of service is LOS A to LOS F with the former indicating
the best operating conditions with low control delays and the latter indicating the worst
conditions with heavy control delays.

Existing LOS is shown in Table 1. Analysis involved the Synchro 8 program which is
based on the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual.


                                        TABLE 1
                                 Existing Level of Service

The results of the table indicate mild existing delays of LOS A to LOS B for the key
intersection.

E. Non-Motorist Traffic

Observations for pedestrian and bicycle activity were made on the nearby street segments.
Pedestrian and bicycle volumes were mild during the site visits. Based on the nature of
the site usage and the location of the site with respect to residential areas, some additional
pedestrian and bicycle traffic could be expected along adjacent roadways upon
completion of the project.

F. Transit Service

Currently no public transit is provided in the vicinity of the site.

G. Sight Distance at Access Driveways

The site access would be located on SR-302, which has a speed limit of 45 mph in the site
vicinity. AASHTO standards require a minimum entering sight distance (ESD) of 555
feet for a 50 mph design speed. While the exact location of the project driveway is not
determined at this time, the stretch of project frontage in the area has no impediments to
sight distance. ESD in the vicinity is over 1000 feet to either direction. SR-302 has no
horizontal curvature and mild vertical curvature near the site.


IV. FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

A. Trip Generation

The proposed Gateway Park project is roughly 39 acres to be developed into a park with a
mix of active and passive uses. In addition, existing access to the adjacent 360 Park
pedestrian/cycling/equestrian trail use would be transferred over for access via Gateway
Park continuing through an access easement on the adjacent Manke Timber Company
parcel to the north (see appendix). The most likely uses for Gateway Park include a spray
park/play area and 2 multipurpose fields, which represent a high end use with regard to
trips, assuming active organized use of the fields rather than passive use. Potential
alternate uses may include a dog park or community garden, which represent a slightly
lower intensity use with regard to trips. The standard city/county/state park
classifications in ITE Trip Generation are somewhat limited, therefore the expected trip
generation below has been determined piecemeal through the individual uses, prior
studies of parks with similar uses, ITE data for soccer fields (LUC 488, assuming similar
usage to multipurpose fields), and discussion with project proponents regarding existing
and anticipated usage. Table 2 on the following page shows the summary of daily and
peak hour trip generation for the project. Refer to the appendix for a more detailed
breakdown of the trip generation based on specific site uses.

                 Time Period                                    Volume

                 PM Peak Outbound                                51 vph
                 PM Peak Total                                  125 vph
                 Average Weekend Traffic                        806 vph
                 Weekend Peak Inbound                            81 vph
                 Weekend Peak Outbound                           81 vph
                 Weekend Peak Total                             162 vph


In addition, there may be special events scheduled at the Gateway Park or 360 Park sites
for which higher than normal trip volumes would be generated. Examples include but
would not be limited to mountain bike races or fun runs. These events would not be the
typical operation, and may involve traffic control plans to be coordinated with WSDOT.

B. Distribution & Assignment

Trip distribution and assignment describes the process by which project generated trips
are dispersed on the street network surrounding the site. Site generated trips are expected
to follow the trip pattern shown in Figure 4. This figure reflects recreation trips taken by
project traffic during the PM peak hour. This distribution is based on existing travel
patterns and the location of nearby residential areas. Figure 4 shows that 70 percent of
project traffic is directed to the east on SR-302 and 20 percent to and from the west. The
remaining 10 percent is on Creviston Drive.


C. Peak Hour Volumes

The year 2018 was used as the horizon study year in order to assess future impacts at a
five-year junction. Future 2018 traffic volumes without the project were derived by
applying a 1 percent annual growth rate to the volumes of Figure 3. The WSDOT Annual
Traffic Report shows flat to negative growth for SR-302 in the vicinity. The 1 percent
annual growth rate therefore provides a conservative analysis with regards to delays. In
addition, pipeline volumes from the Creviston Retail project were considered. Pipeline
volumes are shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 represents 2018 traffic volumes without the
project. Figure 7 shows cumulative 2018 peak hour intersection volumes with project-
generated trips added. Note that these future volume assumptions assume no changes to
the SR-302 route. The WSDOT SR-302 corridor study may implement a route that
relocates SR-302 to run northerly of the project site, in which case volumes shown in
Figures 6 and 7 would be much lower.


                                             10
D. Level of Service

A level of service analysis was next made of the peak hour volumes for future 2018
conditions without and with project trips applied. Results for 2018 traffic conditions for
the weekday PM peak hour are give in Table 3.


                                       TABLE 3

                                                        Without Project    With Project
Intersection            Control     Approach    LOS             Delay     LOS    Delay
SR-302/Creviston          Stop      Northbound   C               20.3      D      32.6
                                    Westbound LT A                9.0      A       9.2
SR-302/Entrance            Stop     Southbound   -                  -      E      48.8
                                    Eastbound    -                  -      A       0.8


As shown in the table delays at the key intersection of SR-302 & Creviston Road should
be at LOS A to LOS D with project traffic included. and project access should be mild at
LOS A to LOS B by the 2018 horizon year for both the weekday PM peak hour and for
the weekend peak hour. Entrance delays may be at LOS E, assuming width for separate
right turn and left turn movements on the driveway, but with no additional turn lanes on
SR-302 assumed.

E. Turn Lane Warrants

Fundamental left turn warrant analysis procedures have been developed by various
agencies to determine whether a left turn pocket would be required at an intersection
given specific traffic and geometric conditions. For this particular study, procedures
described in the WSDOT Design Manual Exhibit 1310-15a were used to assess left turn
storage needs on SR-302 at the project entrance. SR-302 has a posted speed of 45 mph
across the project frontage, and 40 mph just east of the site. The results of the analysis
indicate that a left turn lane would be warranted, although the Total DHV is beyond the
chart's range of values. Extending an assumed 45 mph curve beyond the chart limits
would indicate that a left turn lane would be warranted due to the high Total DHV.

A right turn warrant analysis was also performed based on WSDOT Design Manual
Exhibit 1310-19 to determine whether a right turn pocket or radius treatment should be
considered. The results of the analysis indicate that a right turn lane should be considered
based on the right turn volumes and high through volumes. Refer to the appendix for
WSDOT Exhibits 1310-15a and 1310-19 for the left and right turn warrant analyses.




                                              15
V. SUMMARY & MITIGATION

The Gateway Park project is a 39 acre park with multiple uses within the site. On a daily
basis, roughly 463 total trip movements into and out of the site would be expected with
an estimated 125 trips during the PM peak hour. These volumes represent a park buildout
including a spray park, play area, and 2 multipurpose fields. Actual uses may be
somewhat different, with a dog park and community garden as noted possibilities.
However the analysis in this report represents the high end use with regard to project
trips. These volumes also include a redistribution and increase of the existing trail
volumes for 360 Park, for which the trail access is proposed to be rerouted to use the
Gateway Park access and Manke Timber access easement.

Pedestrian and bicyclist volumes are currently mild on the roads in the area. Some
additional non-motorist activity may be expected once the site is completed. Entering
sight distance is adequate at the project access points. Future delay conditions are
outlined in Table 3. Left turn lanes may be warranted at the project access, and a right
turn pocket or lane could be considered based on WSDOT procedures.

Proposed mitigation for the Gateway Park project is as follows:

       The proposed Gateway Park is located in TSA 1. However, there is no applicable
       land use code provided by Pierce County. The Traffic Impact Fee would therefore
       be based on the general cost per trip end for TSA 1 ($160.00), and the expected
       daily trips generated (463).

       The TIF is calculated at $74,080 based on these assumptions.

       Consideration should be made to extend the 40 mph speed limit on SR-302 across
       the project frontage due to turning movements at the project entrance.
       Determination would be made by WSDOT.

       A left turn lane would be warranted on SR-302 at the project entrance primarily
       due to high through volumes. Also, a right turn lane or pocket could be
       considered on SR-302 at the project entrance due to right turn activity coupled
       with high approach volumes. Project proponents should coordinate with WSDOT
       for a plan of implementation for any lane work on SR-302.

       Coordinate with WSDOT for a Traffic Control Plan for special events that would
       generate trips beyond the normal activity levels. For these events flaggers and
       signage may be required.

No other mitigation is identified at this time.

        APPENDIX




           17
                                   LEVEL OF SERVICE


The following are excerpts from the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation
Research Board Special Report 209.

Quality of service requires quantitative measures to characterize operational conditions
within a traffic stream. Level of service (LOS) is a quality measure describing
operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally in terms of such service measures
as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and comfort and
convenience.

Six LOS are defined for each type of facility that has analysis procedures available.
Letters designate each level, from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating
conditions and LOS F the worst. Each level of service represents a range of operating
conditions and the driver's perception of those conditions.

Level-of-Service definitions

The following definitions generally define the various levels of service for arterials.

Level of service A represents primarily free-flow operations at average travel speeds,
usually about 90 percent of the free-flow speed for the arterial classification. Vehicles are
seldom impeded in their ability to maneuver in the traffic stream. Delay at signalized
intersections is minimal.

Level of service B represents reasonably unimpeded operations at average travel speeds,
usually about 70 percent of the free-flow speed for the arterial classification. The ability
to maneuver in the traffic stream is only slightly restricted and delays are not bothersome.

Level of service C represents stable operations; however, ability to maneuver and change
lanes in midblock locations may be more restricted than in LOS B, and longer queues,
adverse signal coordination, or both may contribute to lower average travel speeds of
about 50 percent of the average free-flow speed for the arterial classification.

Level of service D borders on a range in which small increases in flow may cause
substantial increases in approach delay and hence decreases in arterial speed. LOS D may
be due to adverse signal progression, inappropriate signal timing, high volumes, or some
combination of these. Average travel speeds are about 40 percent of free-flow speed.

Level of service E is characterized by significant delays and average travel speeds of one-
third the free-flow speed or less. Such operations are caused by some combination of
adverse progression, high signal density, high volumes, extensive delays at critical
intersections, and inappropriate signal timing.



                                             18
Level of service F characterizes arterial flow at extremely low speeds, from less than one-
third to one-quarter of the free-flow speed. Intersection congestion is likely at critical
signalized locations, with long delays and extensive queuing.

These definitions are general and conceptual in nature, and they apply primarily to
uninterrupted flow. Levels of service for interrupted flow facilities vary widely in terms
of both the user's perception of service quality and the operational variables used to
describe them.

For each type of facility, levels of service are defined based on one or more operational
parameters that best describe operating quality for the subject facility type. While the
concept of level of service attempts to address a wide range of operating conditions,
limitations on data collection and availability make it impractical to treat the full range of
operational parameters for every type of facility. The parameters selected to define levels
of service for each facility type are called "measures of effectiveness" or "MOE's", and
represent available measures that best describe the quality of operation on the subject
facility type.

Each level of service represents a range of conditions, as defined by a range in the
parameters given. Thus, a level of service is not a discrete condition, but rather a range of
conditions for which boundaries are established.

The following tables describe levels of service for signalized and unsignalized
intersections. Level of service for signalized intersections is defined in terms of average
control delay. Delay is a measure of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption and
lost travel time, as well as time from movements at slower speeds and stops on
intersection approaches as vehicles move up in queue position or slow down upstream of
an intersection. Level of service for unsignalized intersections is determined by the
computed or measured control delay and is determined for each minor movement.

As described in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual, level of service breakpoints for all-
way stop controlled (AWSC) intersections are somewhat different than the criteria used
for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is that drivers expect
different levels of performance from distinct kinds of transportation facilities. The
expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes
than an AWSC intersection. Thus a higher level of control delay is acceptable at a
signalized intersection for the same level of service.

Gateway Park Trip Generation

The proposed Gateway Park project is roughly 39 acres to be developed into a park with a
mix of active and passive uses. In addition, existing access to the adjacent 360 Park
pedestrian/cycling/equestrian trail use would be transferred over for access via Gateway
Park. The most likely uses for Gateway Park include a spray park/play area and 2
multipurpose fields, which represent a high end use with regard to trips, assuming active
organized use of the fields rather than passive use. Potential alternate uses may include a
dog park or community garden, which represent a slightly lower intensity use with regard
to trips. The standard city/county/state park classifications in ITE Trip Generation are
somewhat limited, therefore the expected trip generation below has been determined
piecemeal through the individual uses, prior studies of parks with similar uses, ITE data
for soccer fields (LUC 488), and discussion with project proponents regarding existing
and anticipated usage.

Spray Park/Play Area
Weekday daily use, 100 families:                  200 trips
Weekend daily use, 200 families:                  400 trips
Weekday PM peak, 25 families:                     25 inbound/10 outbound vph
Weekend peak, 40 families:                        40 inbound/40 outbound vph

Multipurpose Fields (2 Fields)
Weekday daily use (ITE LUC 488):                  143 trips
Weekend daily use (est 2x weekday):               286 trips
Weekday PM peak (ITE LUC 488):                    23 inbound/12 outbound vph
Weekday PM peak (study):                          34 inbound/26 outbound vph

Pedestrian, Cycling, Equestrian Trails
(Rerouted access for existing 360 Park)
Existing daily use, 40 vehicles
Existing PM peak, 10 vehicles (est)
New daily use, incr to 60 vehicles:               120 trips
New PM peak, incr to 15 vehicles:                 15 inbound/15 outbound vph


Estimated Total Trip Generation
Average Daily Weekday Trips:          463 trips
Weekday PM Peak Hour Trips:           74 inbound/51 outbound

Average Daily Weekend Trips:          806 trips
Weekend Peak Hour Trips:
  (assume 20% of daily total):        81 inbound/81 outbound

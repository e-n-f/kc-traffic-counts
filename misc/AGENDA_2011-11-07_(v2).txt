OBJECTIVES, COMMUNITY                        Clinton Case presented highlights from the Report
DEVELOPMENT                                  on Departmental Objectives for the Building
                                             Department. Mr. Case reported increases in
building permit fees. He noted there are a number of large projects that have shown progress
over the past six months including the Takeda Childcare Center, the Wastewater Reclamation
Facility, the Park District Woodland Park improvement project, School District 109
Administrative Building, Rosebud, Biaggi's, and Noodles & Company. Additionally, Walgreens
is beginning a $5 million renovation and Wonder! is opening in early November.

Mr. Case noted the Department has been very busy and has been involved with a number of
zoning appeals and continues to work on fee updates, new ordinances and issuing permits.

Trustee Struthers commended Jeff Hansen, Mr. Case and Mr. Coblentz for their hard work on the
vacant property ordinance.

Principal Planner, Jeff Ryckaert presented highlights from the Report on Departmental
Objectives for the Planning Department. Mr. Ryckaert reported that activity has been steady.
Current projects include the library renovations, Deerbrook Mall, outdoor seating areas, text
amendments, a possible sculpture garden, the flower planter program, recognition of long-
standing businesses, banner poles, sign requests and more. He noted the Northwest Quadrant
Unified Task Force will start meeting in November and staff has been preparing background
Board of Trustees Meeting

materials for the Task Force members. Lastly, he reported that staff has developed a resource
guide for affordable housing, which informs residents of the programs and organizations
available for assistance.

PUBLIC COMMENT                                Andrew Mawrick, 442 Kelburn Road, explained
                                              that he believes the library is excellent and serves
the community well in its current condition. Mr. Mawrick noted that he has concerns regarding
the renovation plans for the library and does not see enough benefits to warrant the $12 million
expenditure.

Benton seconded the motion. The motion passed by the following vote:

                                          Trustee Benton made a motion to remove the item
from the table. Trustee Oppenheim seconded the motion. The motion passed unanimously.

Trustee Struthers stated that during the previous discussion, the Board spoke about separating the
scoreboard portion of the proposed text amendment from the rest of the Ordinance. Trustee
Benton believes representatives from Deerfield High School will come back for approval of the
scoreboard at a later date.

Robert Ruiz, Athletic Director at Deerfield High School, noted they do not have any intention to
install permanent signage on the scoreboard and stated they would come back with the
Board of Trustees Meeting
October 17, 2011
Page 4 of 8

scoreboard proposal. Trustee Oppenheim questioned what would happen to the High School's
timetable if the scoreboard portion were removed from the proposal and the Ordinance was
reintroduced when the High School is ready to install the scoreboard? Mr. Ruiz explained the
school wants to have discussions with corporations regarding scoreboard sponsorship. Trustee
Struthers reported she would not want the scoreboard to be visible from Waukegan Road as it
may be distracting for drivers. She would want to see what is proposed for the scoreboard before
approving it.

Trustee Farkas made a motion to accept the Ordinance removing the scoreboard reference in
three portions of the Ordinance. Mr. Coblentz noted a new public hearing would have to be held
if the scoreboard reference was removed from the Ordinance. Mr. Coblentz noted the Ordinance,
as written, requires the petitioner to appear before the Plan Commission for final approval of the
scoreboard's design, location and size but that the general parameters could be approved at this
time. This will stand as a First Reading.

Trustee Seiden suggested including language in the Ordinance related to the type of advertising
allowed on the fences. He recognized the School District has an independent Board but
recommended incorporating Village Board input because the signs would be viewed by the
public. He noted there is a 2007 School District policy stating what can be displayed, but he
would like to add minimal rules on the type of advertising allowed. Mayor Rosenthal questioned
what would be in the Village's policy that is not covered by the School District's policy? Trustee
Oppenheim noted the School District's policy seems complete. Trustee Farkas believes the
Village should be able to rely on the School District to exercise judgment on what kids see on
fences.

DRIVING ­ 2R
                                               Trustee Farkas stated that he supports this
Ordinance. He would like the Village to reevaluate the Ordinance once it is in place, to ensure
the fines are high enough. Trustee Farkas believes this is a safety issue but the fines do not
support the level of seriousness of the issue. Mr. Street suggested reviewing the Ordinance in six
months. Mayor Rosenthal contacted the State Representatives and noted that Representative
Karen May will re-introduce this legislation proposing to make it a State law.

Rob Klein, 1152 Norman Lane, is a labor lawyer in Highland Park. He drives two hours a day to
see clients and sees all types of distracting behavior while driving. He is in favor of having a
State-wide ordinance against handheld devices. Mr. Klein is concerned because if a municipality
passes an ordinance that is not State-wide, it becomes chaotic for people to know the ordinance
of each individual jurisdiction. Mayor Rosenthal noted that is why the Village is supporting a
State-wide ban against the use of handheld devices while driving.

Mayor Rosenthal stated the Ordinance would go into effect on November 1, 2011. The Village
will work on installing signage, educating residents, publishing an article in D-Tails and sending
out press releases.

Trustee Oppenheim made a motion adopt the Ordinance. Trustee Benton seconded the motion.

The bid met all the specifications and staff feels comfortable recommending the award.

Chevrolet in the net amount of $17,726. Trustee Farkas seconded the motion. The motion

                                           services Deerbrook Mall and its outlets. In 2009,
Stanley Consultants was awarded the design contract. The current project went out to bid and
Board of Trustees Meeting

the Village received seven bids. The lowest bidder came in at $283,000; however, their
references were not favorable and the Village staff was not comfortable awarding the contract to
the lowest bidder. The second lowest bidder had a number of similar, municipal projects, with
excellent results and references.

something that he takes lightly.

HALLOWEEN FESTIVITIES                         Mr. Street noted many businesses in downtown

Summary of Background and Reason for Request

In July, 2011 temporary all-way stop signs were erected at Robert York and Osterman Avenue due to the
significant amount of detoured traffic from the Deerfield Road underpass project. As discussed by the
Board and at the Village's request, Gewalt Hamilton Associates, Inc. conducted a warrant study to
determine the appropriateness of installing a permanent stop for Osterman Avenue traffic at this
intersection. From its investigation and pursuant to traffic engineering guidelines, Gewalt Hamilton found
that minimum vehicle and pedestrian volumes were not met to warrant a 4-way stop at the intersection.

Based on the petitions received, owners at the South Commons Condominiums have been notified of the
Board meeting and are expected to attend.

A representative from Gewalt Hamilton will be in attendance to answer questions from the Board.

Subject: Traffic Control Warrant / Review
         Robert York Avenue @ Osterman Avenue
         Meadowbrook Lane @ Margate Terrace
         Deerfield, IL


                                      PART I. PROJECT CONTEXT
GEWALT HAMILTON ASSOCIATES, INC. (GHA) received a request from the Village of Deerfield to review
the existing traffic control at the above referenced intersections to determine if the current posting of
Stop signs was warranted in conformance with the standards as published in the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and to provide recommendations if changes were necessary.

                                PART II BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Exhibit 1 ­ Location Maps

      Exhibits 1A and 1B provide location maps of the subject intersections:

      The Robert York Avenue / Osterman Avenue intersection is located southwest of downtown
      Deerfield and the Deerfield Square shopping center.

      The Meadowbrook Lane / Margate Terrace intersection is located northeast of downtown Deerfield
      and near the northwest corner of Deerspring Park just west of Lions Drive.

Exhibit 2 ­ Photo Inventory

      Exhibits 2A and 2B provide a photo inventory of current traffic operations at each intersection.
      Pertinent comments include:

      2A ­ Robert York Ave at Osterman Ave

         This four ­ legged intersection is currently signed as a two-way stop controlled (TWSC)
         intersection with Stop signs for the north and south Robert York Avenue approaches.
                                                                              Traffic Control Warrant / Review
                                                                       Robert York Avenue @ Osterman Avenue
                                                                        Meadowbrook Lane @ Margate Terrace
                                                                                                 Deerfield, IL

       The surrounding area is a shopping center on the north side and mixed residential / commercial
       on the south side.
       An existing commercial building at the northeast corner of the intersection restricts sight lines to
       the east along Osterman from the north approach as does a heavily landscaped area on the
       southeast corner.
       The posted speed limit on Osterman Avenue is 25-mph. There is no posted limit on Robert York
       Ave.

   2B ­ Meadowbrook Lane at Margate Terrace

       This "T" intersection is currently signed as a two-way stop controlled (TWSC) intersection with
       Stop signs for the north and Meadowbrook and east (westbound) Margate Terrace approaches.
       The surrounding area is a variety of single family residential developments, varying from
       traditional city lots to more rural larger lots.
       Margate Terrace provides an approximately 22 ­foot wide curb and gutter section and is posted
       25-mph.
       Meadowbrook Lane is posted as a private road north of the intersection. It provides a narrow
       (20-foot) pavement section and is a rural (no curb and gutter) roadway section. The posted speed
       limit on Meadowbrook is 15-mph.

Exhibit 3 ­ Existing Traffic

   Exhibits 3A and 3B summarize the existing traffic counts conducted by GHA. 12 Hour (6 am to 6
   pm) counts were conducted at each intersection using the video based Miovision technology. Data
   was collected at the Robert York / Osterman and Meadowbrook / Margate intersections in
   September 2011. Hourly volumes are summarized, and complete data collection results in 15-minute
   intervals are provided in Appendix I.

                         PART III TRAFFIC CONTROL REQUIREMENTS
Background

The Illinois Vehicle Code incorporates by reference the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD) which standardizes and governs the posting of traffic control devices (e.g. traffic signals, stop
signs, roadway information signs, etc...). Sections 2B.06 and 2B.07 discuss the installation of Stop
Signs and Multi-Way Stop applications respectively (see Appendix II).

The MUTCD establishes criteria which should be considered prior to installing traffic control signage.
Data to be considered includes traffic volumes, crash history, sight lines and an allowance is also made
for engineering judgment in some cases. The following paraphrases the MUTCD language

Typical Stop applications (or TWSC) require the minor street to Stop for the major street. This is the
most common type of Stop application and has fairly limited requirements for posting, including:
    Guidance to consider a Yield sign prior to installation of a Stop sign
    Vehicular volume on the through street of 6,000 vehicles per day (vpd)
                                                          GEWALT HAMILTON ASSOCIATES, INC. ­ Page 2
                                                                               Traffic Control Warrant / Review
                                                                        Robert York Avenue @ Osterman Avenue
                                                                         Meadowbrook Lane @ Margate Terrace
                                                                                                  Deerfield, IL
       Restricted view considerations
       Crash history of collisions subject to correction by posting Stop Control (not all collisions are
       correctable).

Due to the greater impacts on overall intersection operations, the criteria for installation of Multi-Way or
All Way Stop control (AWSC) are more stringent and more detailed and suggest that an engineering
study is necessary:

       Should be based on an engineering study
       When traffic signals are warranted
       Crash history (5 or more correctable crashes in a 12 month period)
       Minimum vehicular volumes
       o Total entering volume of 300 vph for 8 hours on major approach and
       o Minor approach volume (including pedestrians and bikes) of 200 per hour and average delay
          of 30 seconds per vehicle during highest hour
       o Adjustments for traveled speed


                                        PART IV EVALUATION
In addition to the volume counts tabulated in Exhibits 3A and 3B, GHA reviewed the crash data
provided by the Village of Deerfield for the intersections and conducted field visits to observe
operations.

Robert York Ave at Osterman Ave

       Minimum volume not met for AWSC. Major street volume is greater than 300 for most observed
       hours, but minor street volume only exceeded 200 vph for one observed hour.
       GHA was provided with 9 crash reports dating from April 2011 to September 2007. Of the 9
       reported crashes in the vicinity of the intersection there were three Angle collisions, a correctable
       type of crash. However, the number and frequency do not meet the criteria.
       There are sight limitations for the north and south approaches; however the Osterman approaches
       are generally obstruction free and provide the minimum stopping sight distance.

It is our opinion that the existing TWSC posting is appropriate and that AWSC at this intersection is not
warranted.

Meadowbrook Lane at Margate Terrace

       Traffic volume at this location is minimal and does not meet the suggested criteria for either
       TWSC or AWSC, as only two hours out of the 12 counted exceed 100 vph of total entering
       volume.
       There were no crashes at this location that resulted in crash reports filed by the Village of
       Deerfield police department.

                                                                                Traffic Control Warrant / Review
                                                                         Robert York Avenue @ Osterman Avenue
                                                                          Meadowbrook Lane @ Margate Terrace
                                                                                                   Deerfield, IL
         The lack of any intersection light and limited sight lines for traffic approaching from the east and
         for vehicles looking east along Margate from Meadowbrook are likely the reason for the
         somewhat unconventional two way posting (i.e. northbound and westbound traffic only).

It is our opinion that the existing TWSC posting is appropriate for the traffic volume, roadway geometry
and sight lines at the intersection. The MUTCD suggests and we recommend that the Village install
supplemental plaques on the existing Stop sign posts to clarify that ONCOMING (for westbound traffic)
and TRAFFIC FROM THE RIGHT (for southbound traffic) DOES NOT STOP.

                                               PART VI CONCLUSION
GHA has reviewed the traffic volumes, operations, sight lines and when available traffic crash history at
the two subject intersections. At this time, we see no reason to change either intersection to an All Way
or Multi Way Stop sign. We would recommend that the Robert York / Osterman intersection remain as
posted. Consideration could be given to a review of crash data again should a pattern develop or the
Village receive additional complaints. We feel that the current posting at the Meadowbrook / Margate
intersection, while somewhat unconventional, is appropriate and recommend that supplemental signage
be installed to clarify for motorists who may not be familiar with the area that the intersection is not an
All Way Stop.

Subject                Report and Recommendation of the Sustainability Commission re: Anti-Idling
                       Regulations

Action Requested:      Approve Report

Originated By:         Village Board asked Sustainability Commission to Review Topic

Referred To:           Village President and Board of Trustees

Summary of Background and Reason for Request

At the Village Board's August 1, 2011 meeting the Village Board requested that the Sustainability
Commission review Village-wide anti-idling regulations. The Sustainability Commission researched the issue
and reviewed regulations that are in place across the United States. At their October 13, 2011 meeting the
Commission discussed and made a recommendation as follows:

Commissioner Parker made a motion to recommend to the Village Board that an anti-idling ordinance that
allows for a 1 year educational period include the following regulations:

       Applies to: All Vehicles
       Maximum Idling Time: 5 minutes
       Exemptions:
           Medical Necessity
           Traffic Conditions
           Emergency Vehicles
           In temperatures 25° F and below and 90° F and above
           If required for safe operation of a vehicle
           If the vehicle is being repaired or serviced

Commissioner Seidman seconded the motion. Motion passed 5-1; Commissioner Anderson voted no.

The minutes from the October 13, 2011 meeting are attached and more fully describe the conversation and
rationale behind the recommendation. The Police Department has reviewed the recommendations and advise
that an additional exemption of vehicles that need to be idled in order to perform construction activities be
added should the Village Board accept the report.

Jennifer Maltas and Sustainability Commission Chair Matt Wylie will be available to answer questions.

Seidman and seconded by Commissioner Anderson. Motion approved 6-0.

Public Comment
There was no one present for public comment.

Event Recap ­ Community Services Day
Chair Wylie thought that everything went well with Community Services Day and that it was a
worthwhile event for the Commission. Chair Wylie suggested that they ask Max A. Pooch to do
a formal demonstration next year as a part of the event. Ms. Maltas said that she was on the
planning committee and would coordinate that next year. The Commission decided that early
next year they would talk about whether to participate in the Farmers Market or Community
Services Day as the Commission felt they could not staff both at this time.

Anti-Idling Regulations
Ms. Maltas reported that at a recent Village Board meeting the Village Board voted to refer
potential anti-idling regulations to the Commission for research and a recommendation.
Commissioner Anderson voiced his strong opposition to anti-idling regulations. Commissioner
Anderson felt that an ordinance is not appropriate because he feels it would be solving a problem
that we do not have. Commissioner Anderson felt that the law would be draconian and
unenforceable and that the Village should not have laws on the books that cannot be enforced.
Commissioner Anderson felt that the Village should pursue an educational campaign rather than

a regulatory change. Commissioner Anderson feels that the Commission should be working on
something that has a larger impact in the community.

Chair Wylie indicated that he understands Commissioner Anderson's concerns but disagreed and
felt that it was a quality of life issue for the community. Commissioner Parker noted that the
purpose of the regulation is to reduction energy consumption, pollution, and improve the local air
quality.

Chair Wylie noted that the Village Board asked for a recommendation from the Commission and
that one of the options is to make a recommendation stating that the Commission does not
believe we need anti-idling regulations. Ms. Maltas asked the Commission if anyone other than
Commissioner Anderson felt that the Commission should recommend that there be no
regulations. Commissioners Parker, Wylie, and Milani all felt there should be regulations and
Commissioners Loeffl and Seidman both felt there should be limited regulations and potentially
those regulations should only be for certain geographical areas (like by schools) or only for
commercial vehicles.

Ms. Maltas suggested that the Commission start with identifying what the exemptions to idling
regulations would be. The Commission identified the following exemptions:

                 Medical Necessity (example, a person with asthma who needs the air
                 conditioning to run)
                 Traffic Conditions (example, traffic jams or normal flow of traffic)
                 Emergency Vehicles
                 In temperatures 25 degrees F and below and 90 degrees F and above
                 If required for safe operation of a vehicle (example, to completely defrost)
                 If the vehicle is being repaired or serviced.

The Commissioners asked if this would be enforceable on private property. For example, if
someone left their car running in the driveway for a half hour would an officer ticket that person?
Ms. Maltas noted that there is already an ordinance on the books that prohibits a vehicle from
idling unattended; therefore, this was already prohibited. Commissioner Anderson brought up
the issue on whether or not the anti-idling law would be enforceable. Ms. Maltas noted that the
officers are familiar with where this is happening in town and how to handle these situations.
Ms. Maltas noted that most of the time for smaller infractions the violator is warned instead of
ticketed. If there is a persistent problem with someone, having the ability to ticket the person is
important for compliance with the law.

Commissioners then discussed the amount of time vehicles would be prohibited to idle. Ms.
Maltas noted that most existing ordinances that were collected by the EPA had time frames
between 5-10 minutes. Commissioner Seidman felt that 10 minutes would be appropriate
because at times you cannot operate your vehicle due to frost. It was pointed out that there is an
exemption for safe operation of the vehicle and frost would qualify under that exemption. It was
decided to recommend a 5 minute idling time because the exemptions handled other situations
where idling longer was necessary.

Commissioner Loefl asked if these regulations were for commercial vehicles or for all vehicles.
Chair Wylie indicated that he thought they should be for all vehicles because he felt that the
regulations and exemptions were reasonable.

The Commission discussed the need for an educational period prior to beginning enforcement on
any anti-idling regulations. Ms. Maltas noted that from an enforcement perspective, the
ordinance could go into effect if/when the Village Board approves it but the Police Officers
could be instructed only to give warnings for a certain period of time while the educational
campaign was ongoing.

Commissioner Milani felt that a year long educational/warning period would be appropriate
because education could be done throughout all of the seasons. Should the Village Board concur
with a recommendation from the Sustainability Commission, the Commission would
recommended that 2012 would be an educational/warning year and 2013 is when the regulation
would become fully enforceable. The educational campaign would be fully developed if the
regulations are approved but it would include items such as:

       Coordination and education to other governmental districts (information in the school
       district newsletter or a presentation in front of their board)
       Signs in key places where idling happens (schools, train stations, store parking lots, etc.)
       Educational information in D-Tales, cable station, website, etc.

Commissioner Parker made a motion to recommend to the Village Board that an anti-
idling ordinance that allows for a 1 year educational period include the following
regulations:

       Applies to: All Vehicles
       Maximum Idling Time: 5 minutes
       Exemptions:
           Medical Necessity
           Traffic Conditions
           Emergency Vehicles
           In temperatures 25° F and below and 90° F and above
           If required for safe operation of a vehicle
           If the vehicle is being repaired or serviced

Commissioner Seidman seconded the motion. Motion passed 5-1; Commissioner Anderson
voted no.

Ms. Maltas indicated that she would write up the minutes and report for the Commission to
review prior to it going to the Village Board. Assuming all members were comfortable with the
language in the report and minutes, the recommendation would go to the November 7, 2011
Village Board meeting.

Website Review
The Commission deferred review of additional website sections to fully discuss the anti-idling
regulations.

Update from DHS Earthworks
Ms. Lavalliere reported that DHS Earthworks is working on a campaign to eliminate the sale of
bottled water from their cafeteria. DHS Earthworks is going to sell water bottles and encourage
the district to install water bottle filling stations around the school. Chair Wylie was happy to
hear of their efforts and wanted to make sure that Earthworks reaches out to the Sustainability
Commission for any help that they need. Ms. Maltas suggested that an update from DHS
Earthworks is included on each agenda moving forward.

Commission Comments
Chair Wylie asked if anyone had heard from Jack Frigo regarding commercial recycling. Ms.
Maltas said that she had not heard anything and that she would provide Chair Wylie with Mr.
Frigo's email address so that he could touch base. Ms. Maltas reported that the recycling plan
that SWALCO's 60% Recycling Task Force has been working on was approved by the
committee. The Executive Committee of SWALCO will be reviewing the plan next. Once the
plan receives approval from the SWALCO Board it will be sent to municipalities to review and
adopt. Ms. Maltas suggested that the Sustainability Commission review the plan when it comes
out and make recommendations to the Village Board as to what programs or regulations
recommended in the plan the Village of Deerfield should pursue.

Next Meeting Date and Time
The next meeting date will be November 10, 2011 in the Community Conference Room.

Adjournment
The meeting was adjourned at 9:00 PM

Respectfully Submitted,
Jennifer I. Maltas

Subject:   Resolution Authorizing the Village's Participation in the Illinois Public Works Mutual Aid Network
Action Requested: Adopt Resolution Authorizing Participation
Originated By: Public Works and Engineering
Referred To: Village President and Board of Trustees

Summary of Background and Reason for Request

The Illinois Public Works Mutual Aid Network (IPWMAN) is an organization that allows Illinois local
government agencies to enter into a written mutual aid agreement to provide and receive emergency assistance
(e.g., personnel, equipment, materials, etc.) in the event of natural or manmade disasters or other situations that
require action beyond the normal capabilities of an agency. The organization was formed to coordinate resources
for local municipal public works departments, township road districts, county highway departments, etc.
IPWMAN currently has more than 100 members and has been endorsed by the Illinois Chapter of the American
Public Works Association.

The organization complies with criteria established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for
reimbursement of emergency response costs under the Public Assistance Program. The benefits of joining the
organization include:
       In an emergency, a member may request assistance from other members. The member is not required to
       reimburse the other members for the first five days of their assistance. For the sixth and subsequent days
       of their assistance, the member is required to reimburse them per the organization's membership
       agreement.
       When a member requests assistance from other members, the other members are not required to provide
       assistance; instead, they may do so voluntarily.
       The organization provides a member with an aid network of other members with diverse resources from
       all areas within the state, not just the members' surrounding jurisdictions.
       A member may attend educational workshops and training via the organization to prepare for emergencies
       and disasters.
To access the organization's resources in the event of a local emergency, a member assesses the emergency's
impact to determine what type of assistance it needs and contacts the organization's call center to request the
assistance. The organization's call center then sends the member's request to other members and coordinates a
response. To join the organization, an agency must submit to IPWMAN the following documents:
       A resolution passed by its governing body authorizing it to join IPWMAN
       A signed membership agreement
       Membership Dues (The Village's annual dues would be $250)

The Director of Public Works and Engineering requests that the Board adopt the attached Resolution authorizing
the Village's participation in the Illinois Public Works Mutual Aid Network.

implied, by a party hereto, its duly authorized agents and personnel, for failure or refusal to render
aid. Nor shall there be any liability of a party for withdrawal of aid once provided pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.

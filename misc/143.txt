1.0      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Peace River Land Group, LLC is proposing to build a mixed use development in Desoto
County. The development site is located at the northeast quadrant of Kings Highway and
Peace River Street. The anticipated build-out year is 2015.

Trip Generation was performed using the ITE Trip Generation Manual for 326 Single Family
Units (Land Use 210), 510 Multi Family Units (376 Carriage Homes and 134 Duplex units,
Land Use 220), and 218 Town Homes (Land Use 230). The proposed development would
generate 723 trips during the PM Peak Hour.

Based on the local knowledge of commercial and residential land uses in the project vicinity,
the project trips from the development were distributed 25% to the north and 75% to the
south on Kings Highway/CR-769.

Based on the discussion with Desoto County Public Works Department, it was understood
that the roadway link on Kings Highway from Charlotte County line to Peace River Street is
currently under design to widen from 2-lanes to 5-lanes. The anticipated opening year is
2009. Therefore, this link was analyzed as 5-lanes roadway segment for the build-out
conditions. Based on the roadway link analysis, the roadway links on Kings Highway and
the Peace River Street would operate at acceptable levels of service with the proposed
development.

Based on the unsignalized intersection analysis, Kings Highway and Peace River Street
intersection would operate at deficient level of service for the side street, which is not
unusual for stop-controlled intersections. A traffic signal is not recommended at this time.

Based on the turn lane analysis, a southbound left turn lane on Kings Highway at the Project
Entrance 1 is recommended with a storage length of 100 feet plus appropriate taper and
deceleration. In addition, a northbound right turn lane is recommended at this entrance.
Eastbound Left Turn Lanes on Peace River Street at the Project Entrance 2 and Project
Entrance 3 are recommended with storage lengths of 100 feet and 25 feet respectively, plus
appropriate taper and deceleration. In summary, the proposed development does not have a
significantly adverse impact on the surrounding roadway network. No additional
improvements are recommended.

6.0      EXISTING ROADWAY CONDITIONS


Access to the Desoto 300 Development is provided via one driveway on Kings Highway/CR-
769 and two driveways on the Peace River Street.


A turning movement count was performed at the intersection of Kings Highway/CR-769 and
Peace River Street in October 2006. The turning movement data was adjusted to seasonal
conditions using the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) seasonal factor of 1.12.
The turning movement data and FDOT seasonal factor report are provided in Appendix B.


As shown in Table 2, the roadway links on Kings Highway and Peace River Street currently
operate at LOS "C" and better for the peak hour conditions. The FDOT Generalized Level of
Service Table is provided in Appendix C.

7.0       FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

There was no historic data available on Kings Highway and Peace River Street. Therefore, a
growth rate of three (3) percent was assumed on Kings Highway/CR-769 and Peace River
Street.


The 2006 adjusted turning movement data was projected to 2015 using the growth rate
discussed above. The 2015 background traffic is shown in Figure 5.


The 2015 total traffic was obtained by adding 2015 background traffic with the project trips.
The 2015 total traffic is shown in Figure 6.


Based on the discussion with Desoto County Public Works Department, it was understood
that the roadway link on Kings Highway from Charlotte County line to Peace River Street is
currently under design to widen from 2-lanes to 5-lanes. The anticipated opening year is
2009. Therefore, this link was analyzed as 5-lane roadway segment.


Based on the FDOT adopted service volumes, the roadway links were analyzed for the
expected levels of service in the year 2015 with the proposed development. The link LOS
analysis summary is shown in Table 3 for the PM peak hour. As shown in Table 3, the
roadway links would operate at an acceptable level of service in the year 2015 with the
proposed development.

9.0      TURN LANE ANALYSIS


Based on the trip generation and trip distribution, project trips were determined at the
entrances. The Left Turn Lane Warrant Study was performed based on M.D.Harmelink Study.
Figures from M.D. Harmelink are provided in Appendix E. The left turn warrant analysis is
summarized below:


         Southbound Left Turn Lane at the Project Entrance 1 on Kings Highway


         Based on the Projected Traffic, the northbound direction would have 666 vehicles and
         southbound direction would have 434 vehicles during the PM peak hours.


         Advancing Volume     = 550 vph (434+93 (Project Through) + 23(Left Turns))
         Opposing Volume      = 717 vph (666+ 51(Project Through))
         Left Turn Volume     = 23 vph
         Percent Lefts        = 4% (23/550)
         Appropriate Figure   = 14


         Based on these data, the left turn warrant is satisfied.       A left turn lane is
         recommended. The recommended storage length is 100 feet.


         The left turn lane should be constructed with the appropriate taper and deceleration
         lengths in accordance with FDOT Index 301.


         Eastbound Left Turn Lane at the Entrance 2 on Peace River Street


         Based on the Projected Traffic, the eastbound direction would have 71 vehicles and
         westbound direction would have 42 vehicles during the PM peak hours.


         Advancing Volume     = 444 vph (71 + 186 (Left Turns) + 187 (Project Through))
         Opposing Volume      = 145 (42 + 103(Project Through)) vph
         Left Turn Volume     = 186 vph

Traffic Impact Study


         Percent Lefts         = 42% (186/444)
         Appropriate Figure    = 13
         Based on these data, the left turn warrant is satisfied.        A left turn lane is
         recommended. The recommended storage length is 100 feet.


         The left turn lane should be constructed with the appropriate taper and deceleration
         lengths in accordance with FDOT Index 301.


         Eastbound Left Turn Lane at the Entrance 3 on Peace River Street


         Based on the Projected Traffic, the peak direction would have 71 vehicles and off
         peak direction would have 42 vehicles during the PM peak hours.


         Advancing Volume      = 258 vph (71 + 187 Left Turns)
         Opposing Volume       = 42 vph
         Left Turn Volume      = 187 vph
         Percent Lefts         = 72% (187/258)
         Appropriate Figure    = 13


         There is no matching figure for more than 40% left turns. Therefore, highest available
         match figure number 13 was used.


         Based on these data, the left turn warrant is not satisfied. However, left turn peak
         hour volume is more than 100 vph, a left turn lane with minimum 25 feet of storage
         length is recommended.


         The left turn lane should be constructed with the appropriate taper and deceleration
         lengths in accordance with FDOT Index 301.

         Right Turn Lane Analysis


         The Right Turn Lane Warrant Study was performed based on the article "Exclusive
         Right Turn Lanes at Unsignalized Intersections, When We Should Require Them?"
         published by the Statewide Access Management Team of Florida Department of
         Transportation (FDOT). The posted speed limit on Kings Highway in the project
         location is 55 mph. The article identifies the threshold of right turns requiring a turn
         lane 40 vph for a facility with posted speed limit over 45 MPH. The FDOT article is
         provided in Appendix E.

         As shown in Table 5, a northbound right turn lane is recommended at the intersection
         of Kings Highway and Project Entrance 1.


         The right turn lane need to be constructed in accordance with FDOT Index 301.

         10.0      CONCLUSION


Based on the roadway link analysis, the roadway links on Kings Highway and the Peace
River Street would operate at an acceptable level of service with the proposed development.


Based on the unsignalised intersection analysis, Kings Highway and Peace River Street
intersection would operate at deficient level of service for the side street, which is not
unusual for stop-controlled intersections. A traffic signal is not recommended at this time.


Based on turn lane analysis, a southbound left turn lane on Kings Highway at the Project
Entrance 1 is recommended with a storage length of 100 feet plus appropriate taper and
deceleration. In addition, a northbound right turn lane is recommended at this entrance.
Eastbound Left Turn Lanes on Peace River Street at the Project Entrance 2 and Project
Entrance 3 are recommended with storage lengths of 100 feet and 25 feet respectively, plus
appropriate taper and deceleration.


In summary, the proposed development does not have a significantly adverse impact on the
surrounding roadway network. No additional improvements are recommended.

*This table does not constitute a standard and should be used only for general planning applications. The computer models from which this table is derived should be used for more specific planning applications.
The table and deriving computer models should not be used for corridor or intersection design, where more refined techniques exist. Values shown are two-way annual average daily volumes (based on K100 factors) for
levels of service and are for the automobile/truck modes unless specifically stated. Level of service letter grade thresholds are probably not comparable across modes and, therefore, cross modal comparisons should be
made with caution. Furthermore, combining levels of service of different modes into one overall roadway level of service is not recommended. The table's input value defaults and level of service criteria appear on the
following page. Calculations are based on planning applications of the Highway Capacity Manual, Bicycle LOS Model, and Pedestrian LOS Model, respectively for the automobile/truck, bicycle and pedestrian modes.
**Cannot be achieved using table input value defaults.
***Not applicable for the level of service letter grade. For bicycle and pedestrian modes, the level of service letter grade (including F) is not achievable, because there is no maximum vehicle volume threshold using table
input value defaults.

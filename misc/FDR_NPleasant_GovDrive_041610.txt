                                             This report summarizes VHB's findings regarding the most efficient final
                                             configuration for the North Pleasant Street/Governors Drive/Eastman Lane
                                             intersection. The following two improvement options were considered as the most
                                             feasible options to address the current congestion at the intersection and balance
                                             mobility for vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists:

                                                 Option 1 - Enhanced Signal Control ­ An enhanced signalized intersection
                                                 consisting of an additional southbound right-turn lane on North Pleasant Street
                                                 and an additional eastbound left-turn lane on Governors Drive. The enhanced
                                                 signal would include vehicle detection on all approaches using stop-line loops
                                                 embedded in the pavement that can detect gaps and shorten or lengthen green
                                                 times as needed to adapt to traffic demands. Pedestrian push buttons would be
                                                 provided on all crossings.

              signal concept,
              including additional
              turning lanes

                                                 Option 2 - Roundabout ­ A one-lane roundabout, or circular intersection, where
                                                 all approaches yield to the counterclockwise circulating traffic within the
                                                 roundabout. A roundabout is not the same premise as a large diameter, high
                                                 speed rotary. Rather, traffic yields upon entering the roundabout and circulates
                                                 at a posted speed of 20 miles per hour.

         center island and
         deflected approaches




                                             This report presents baseline conditions to demonstrate the need for improvements,
                                             and presents a side-by-side comparison of both options with regard to traffic
                                             operations, safety, pedestrian/bicycle accommodations, truck maneuverability, right-
                                             of-way, vehicle emissions and fuel consumption, and costs. The following
                                             conclusions are reached:

                                                 Traffic Operations: Both Option 1 and Option 2 demonstrate marked
                                                 improvements over the existing signal with respect to queues. There is very little
                                                 difference when comparing Option 1 with Option 2, both yield similar queue
                                                 lengths. The roundabout under Option 2 yields lower vehicle delays than Option
                                                 1.

                                                 Safety: Based on before and after studies completed by the Federal Highway
                                                 Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the roundabout
                                                 under Option 2 is expected to result in safer conditions for vehicles, pedestrians,

                                                 and bicyclists when compared to the upgraded signal under Option 1. This is
                                                 due primarily to several safety-related features of the roundabout, including:


                                                 1.   Slower vehicle speeds that are similar to a bicyclist speed (20 miles per hour);
                                                 2.   Drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists pay more attention to the environment at
                                                      roundabouts; there is no false sense of right-of-way, no yellow-light
                                                      acceleration, or no red-light running with a roundabout;
                                                 3.   Gaps in the traffic stream are easier to gauge and determine due to the
                                                      slower speeds and the fact that vehicles are only approaching from one
                                                      direction; and
                                                 4.   The crossing distances are shorter with splitter islands serving as a refuge
                                                      area; pedestrians are also more aware of the environment at a roundabout
                                                      due to the two-stage crossing.


                                                 Pedestrians and Bicyclists: The roundabout under Option 2 will yield more
                                                 efficient crossings with less conflict points for pedestrians and bicyclists when
                                                 compared to the upgraded signal under Option 1. The crossing distances are
                                                 actually longer under the signal compared to the roundabout. The majority of
                                                 pedestrians at the existing signal were observed crossing without using the push-
                                                 button, or without waiting for the exclusive crossing phase after pushing the
                                                 button.

                                                 Tractor-trailers/Fire Trucks/PVTA Bus Maneuverability: Both Option 1 and
                                                 Option 2 accommodate semi-tractor trailers, fire trucks, and PVTA buses. The
                                                 roundabout under Option 2 includes a mountable truck apron within the layout
                                                 of the central island.

                                                 Right-of-way: Based on preliminary designs, there is no difference between
                                                 Option 1 and Option 2 with regard to right-of-way primarily because the
                                                 upgraded signal requires additional turning lanes. There is available right-of-
                                                 way to accommodate both options.

                                                 Sustainability - Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Noise, and Fuel Consumption:
                                                 Because the vehicle delays are reduced and the frequency of stop-and-start cycles
                                                 are reduced, Option 2 (roundabout) would yield significantly lower vehicle
                                                 emissions (Carbon Monoxide, Nitrous Oxide, Carbon Dioxide, Hydrocarbons),
                                                 noise, and fuel consumption when compared to Option 1.

                                                 Costs: The construction costs of Option 1 and Option 2 are similar. However, the
                                                 regular maintenance costs of the roundabout under Option 2 are lower than
                                                 Option 1 and the service life of the roundabout exceeds that of most signal
                                                 equipment. Thus, over the long term, Option 2 would be preferred from a
                                                 maintenance cost perspective over Option 1. The roundabout does require

_GovDrive_041610.doc                         ES-III   Executive Summary
                                                 special considerations and maintenance crew training and education for plowing
                                                 and drainage to ensure that the central island is not used to store plowed snow.



                                             Based on this multimodal evaluation of vehicles, trucks, pedestrians, and
                                             bicyclists, the one-lane roundabout (Option 2) is a more efficient, sustainable, and
                                             cost effective option when compared to an enhanced traffic signal (Option 1). In
                                             addition, the roundabout has the added benefit of creating a gateway entrance into
                                             the campus from North Amherst which has the added benefit of slowing vehicle
                                             speeds along North Pleasant Street.

                                             Amherst, MA. North Pleasant Street bisects the UMASS campus and the intersection
                                             of North Pleasant Street/Governors Drive/Eastman Lane is the northern gateway to
                                             the campus.

                                             The intersection is currently under a temporary signalized configuration while a
                                             steam tunnel is constructed diagonally across the roadway. Given the opportunity
                                             presented by the construction activity and the need to restore the intersection
                                             configuration upon construction completion, UMASS retained VHB to explore the
                                             most efficient configuration for the intersection once the construction is complete.

                                             The North Pleasant Street corridor and the intersection fall under the jurisdiction of
                                             the Town of Amherst. From the November 2009 zoning map for the Town of
                                             Amherst (http://www.amherstma.gov), the land surrounding the intersection is
                                             zoned Educational (ED) except for an area of the northwest quadrant of the
                                             intersection in the vicinity of Farview Way which is zoned Neighborhood ­ Residence
                                             (R-N). The intersection currently experiences long delays and queues in the morning
                                             along North Pleasant Street southbound (toward the campus) and in the evening
                                             along Governors Drive eastbound (leaving the campus toward North Amherst).

                                             This chapter presents the existing conditions assessment and the methods used to
                                             conduct the assessment. The purpose of this assessment is to help determine the need
                                             for enhancements at the intersection of North Pleasant Street/Governors
                                             Drive/Eastman Lane and set the framework and foundation for evaluating
                                             improvement options.



2.1 Traffic Volumes
                                             Passenger vehicle, truck, pedestrian, and bicycle volumes were collected in both
                                             March and May 2009 during periods when school was in regular session and
                                             weather was amenable to walking and bicycling. The traffic data included daily
                                             counts on North Pleasant Street, Governors Drive, and Eastman Lane, along with
                                             peak hour intersection turning movement counts. The daily count data provides
                                             insight into when peak periods occur and the intensity of traffic occurring during the
                                             peak period while the peak hour counts are used for traffic operations analyses and
                                             modeling.


                                             Vehicular Traffic

                                             Daily automatic traffic recorder (ATR) data were collected for a typical weekday to
                                             demonstrate hourly fluctuations. ATRs consist of pressurized tubes placed across the
                                             road surface that count vehicles automatically as they pass over the tube. Figure 1
                                             depicts the ATR data showing the hour-by-hour traffic fluctuations for all traffic
                                             entering the North Pleasant Street and Governors Drive/Eastman Lane intersection.
                                             Table 1 summarizes the daily traffic volumes.

                                             As Figure 1 indicates, the North Pleasant Street/Governors Drive/Eastman Lane
                                             intersection is busiest in the evening peak hour when it processes approximately
                                             1,400 vehicles per hour (vph). By comparison, in the morning peak hour the
                                             intersection processes approximately 830 vph- 41 percent less than the evening peak
                                             hour. The majority of the morning peak hour traffic entering the intersection is on
                                             one approach - North Pleasant Street southbound (toward campus). In the evening
                                             peak hour, all approaches are active (North Pleasant Street, Governors Drive, and
                                             Eastman Lane).

                                             The ATR data summarized in Table 1 indicate the following:

                                                 North Pleasant Street carries approximately 10,200 vehicles per day (vpd) north
                                                 of the Governors Drive/Eastman Lane intersection and 7,500 vpd south of the
                                                 intersection. Peak hour volumes on North Pleasant Street vary from 5.2 to 8.1
                                                 percent of daily traffic. During the morning, the predominant traffic flow on
                                                 North Pleasant Street is southbound. During the evening, traffic is balanced in
                                                 the northbound and southbound directions.

                                                 Governors Drive carries 8,700 vehicles daily. Traffic on Governors Drive is
                                                 heavier in the westbound direction in the morning (away from North Pleasant
                                                 Street) and in the eastbound direction in the evening peak hour (toward North
                                                 Pleasant Street).

                                                 Eastman Lane carries 6,300 vehicles daily. Mirroring traffic patterns on
                                                 Governors Drive, traffic on Eastman Lane is heavier in the eastbound direction in
                                                 the morning (away from North Pleasant Street) and in the westbound direction
                                                 in the evening (toward North Pleasant Street).

                                             In addition to the ATR counts, manual turning movement counts (TMCs) were
                                             conducted in March 2009 from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM for the weekday morning peak
                                             period and from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM for the weekday evening peak period. These
                                             TMC data are used as the primary inputs into the traffic operations analysis and
                                             modeling. Figure 2 shows the resulting morning and afternoon peak hour traffic
                                             volumes for existing conditions and forecasted 2019 conditions.


                                             Pedestrian and Bicycle Activity

                                             In May 2009, field surveys of pedestrian and bicycle activity were completed. These
                                             surveys were completed to better understand the origin and destination travel
                                             patterns of pedestrians and bicyclists to help inform the development of
                                             improvement options regarding pedestrian and bicycle modes. Observations were
                                             taken during the morning and afternoon peak periods, 7:00 to 9:00 AM and 4:00 to
                                             6:00 PM. The traffic model used to evaluate the carrying capacity of the intersection
                                             was calibrated with these pedestrian and bicycle activity levels.

                                                 during the morning peak period, between 7:00 and 9:00 AM. During the
                                                 morning, the majority of the pedestrian and bicycle flows travelled southbound
                                                 on North Pleasant Street and westbound on Governors Drive.

                                                 Afternoon Peak Period. A total of 487 pedestrians and 83 bicyclists were
                                                 observed during the afternoon peak period, between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. The
                                                 afternoon peak period was busier than the morning peak period. During the
                                                 afternoon, the flow of pedestrians and bicycles were spread out almost evenly in
                                                 all directions through the intersection.

                                                 Pedestrian flows. By far the heaviest pedestrian directional flow observed was in
                                                 the vicinity of the northeast corner of the Hamlin House dormitories ­ where
                                                 pedestrians traveled between North Pleasant Street and Eastman Lane. This
                                                 movement does not require crossing the intersection.

                                                 Bicycle flows. The heaviest bicycle directional flow observed was 12 bicycles in
                                                 the morning and 25 bicycles in the afternoon traveling along North Pleasant
                                                 Street. During the morning, these 12 bicycles were travelling southbound on
                                                 North Pleasant Street (toward campus), while in the afternoon the 25 bicycles
                                                 observed were travelling northbound on North Pleasant Street (toward North
                                                 Amherst). Bicyclists used both the road and the sidewalks as travel ways,
                                                 depending on convenience. Approximately half of the bicyclists used the road
                                                 and half traveled on the sidewalks.

                                                 Diagonal crossing. Most of the pedestrians who parked their vehicles at the
                                                 Totman Gym lot were heading towards the back of the Lederle Graduate
                                                 Research Center (GRC). Most of these pedestrians crossed the intersection
                                                 diagonally.

                                             The appendix to the report contains a detailed desire line analysis of pedestrian flows
                                             showing the primary routes, secondary routes, and minor routes.



2.2 Safety Review
                                             A safety assessment was conducted to help determine if safety concerns exist for
                                             vehicles, pedestrians, or bicyclists. For this assessment, MassDOT intersection crash
                                             data and rates were obtained from 2004 to 2007, the most recent three years of data
                                             available. Crash rates were calculated based on the number of crashes relative to the
                                             volume of traffic traveling through the intersection on a daily basis. Rates that
                                             exceed MassDOT's average district-wide rate could indicate safety or geometric
                                             issues that warrant further examination. While the intersection is not under the
                                             jurisdiction of MassDOT, safety analyses typically refer to statewide procedures to

                                             help determine if the crash occurrence is excessive when compared to the traffic
                                             demands served.

                                             A summary of the vehicle crash history at the intersection of North Pleasant Street at
                                             Governors Drive/Eastman Lane is presented in Table 2. The following are the key
                                             findings from the crash data review:


                                                 Frequency - There were a total of 11 crashes at the intersection of North Pleasant
                                                 Street and Governors Drive/Eastman Lane from 2005 to 2007. When compared
                                                 to the volume of traffic passing through the intersection, the 11 crashes result in a
                                                 crash rate of 0.60 crashes per million entering vehicle, which is below the
                                                 MassDOT average rate of 0.83, suggesting that the number of crashes is not
                                                 excessive when compared to the traffic demands served. None of the crashes
                                                 involved pedestrians or bicyclists.
                                                 Crash Type - The most frequent crash type was rear-end collisions (5 crashes, 46
                                                 percent), followed by angle collisions (2 crashes, 18 percent), and sideswipes (2
                                                 crashes, 18 percent). Traffic signals by nature can result in increased rear-end
                                                 collisions compared to conditions without a traffic signal because they introduce
                                                 traffic flow interruptions on the main street for the benefit of the side street.
                                                 Severity - There were no fatal crashes at the intersection. The majority of the
                                                 crashes (7 crashes, 64 percent) involved property damage only. Injury crashes
                                                 accounted for 2 crashes (18 percent) over the three year period.
                                                 Time of Day ­ All of the crashes occurred during weekday off-peak conditions (7
                                                 crashes, 64 percent) or during the weekend (4 crashes, 36 percent). There were no
                                                 crashes during the morning or afternoon peak periods.
                                                  Pavement Conditions ­ Weather did not appear to influence the crashes since
                                                 the majority of crashes occurred during dry pavement conditions (9 crashes, 82
                                                 percent).

2.3 Traffic Operations
                                             Understanding the relationship between the supply and demand is a fundamental
                                             consideration in evaluating how well transportation infrastructure fulfills its
                                             objective to safely and efficiently accommodate the traveling public. This section

                                                     presents the details of the traffic operations assessment for the study intersection.
                                                     The evaluation procedures and criteria used to analyze the study intersection are
                                                     based on the Highway Capacity Manual1.

                                                     Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative measure used to describe operational
                                                     conditions. Level of service incorporates factors such as speed, travel time, freedom
                                                     to maneuver, and traffic interruptions. Similar to a report card, level of service is
                                                     designated by levels A through F, with LOS A representing the best operating
                                                     conditions and LOS F the worst. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) does not
                                                     present a recommended level of service for design purposes. However, LOS E or
                                                     LOS F are generally considered unacceptable conditions leading to excessive delays
                                                     or queues which warrant an improvement.

                                                     Table 3 compares signal operations under existing conditions and 2019 conditions
                                                     under a "do nothing" scenario, where no intersection upgrades occur and the
                                                     intersection is restored to its exact condition before the construction activity started.

                                             excessive and do not clear within the signal cycle.

                                             During the afternoon peak hour, Governors Drive is the busiest approach with
                                             queues reaching 465 feet (approximately 19 vehicles). Under 2019 conditions, these
                                             queues extend to 540 feet (22 vehicles). These queues are excessive and do not clear
                                             within the signal cycle.



2.4 Bus Operations
                                             There is notable bus and truck activity through the intersection and headed along
                                             North Pleasant Street to Governors Drive. Before the construction activity
                                             commenced, the southbound right turn movement (North Pleasant Street
                                             southbound to Governors Drive) was very difficult for trucks and buses due to the
                                             tight radius at this corner of the intersection. If there was a vehicle on Governors
                                             Drive waiting at the signal, the buses/trucks will encroach over the curb.
                                             Fortunately, the sidewalk was set back behind a tree so this curb encroachment is not
                                             creating a pedestrian safety issue. The current configuration of the intersection has
                                             addressed the difficult southbound right-turn through the provision of a larger
                                             turning radius.




2.5 Summary of Baseline Conditions
                                             The following key observations and conclusions were made in this chapter:

                                                  Pedestrians and Bicyclists. There are notable pedestrian and bicyclist demands
                                                  at the intersection. A total of 283 pedestrians and 31 bicyclists were observed
                                                  during the morning peak period, between 7:00 and 9:00 AM. During the
                                                  morning, the majority of the pedestrian and bicycle flows travelled southbound
                                                  on North Pleasant Street and westbound on Governors Drive. The afternoon
                                                  peak period was busier than the morning peak period. A total of 487 pedestrians
                                                  and 83 bicyclists were observed during the afternoon peak period, between 4:00
                                                  and 6:00 PM. During the afternoon, the flow of pedestrians and bicycles were
                                                  spread out almost evenly in all directions through the intersection. Bicyclists
                                                  used both the road and the sidewalks as travel ways, depending on convenience.
                                                  Approximately half of the bicyclists used the road and half traveled on the
                                                  sidewalks.

                                                  Crashes. There were no fatal crashes at the intersection and the occurrence of
                                                  crashes is below the MassDOT District average. None of the crashes involved
                                                  pedestrians or bicyclists.

                                                  Excessive queues and delays. During the morning peak hour, southbound
                                                  queues on North Pleasant Street reach 390 feet, the equivalent of 16 vehicles.
                                                  Under 2019 conditions, these queues are expected to extend to 461 feet (18
                                                  vehicles). During the afternoon peak hour, Governors Drive is the busiest
                                                  approach with queues reaching 465 feet (approximately 19 vehicles). Under 2019
                                                  conditions, these queues are expected extend to 540 feet (22 vehicles). These
                                                  queues are excessive and do not clear within the signal cycle.



                                             Finally, the intersection of North Pleasant Street/Governors Drive/Eastman Lane is
                                             the northern gateway to the campus. However, the current intersection configuration
                                             does not convey a gateway transition into a campus setting where the presence of
                                             pedestrians and bicyclists crossing North Pleasant Street is significantly increased.

                                             Given the opportunity presented by the construction activity and the operational
                                             issues as described in Chapter 2, UMASS wanted to explore the most efficient final
                                             configuration for the North Pleasant Street/Governors Drive/Eastman Lane
                                             intersection. After reviewing the baseline condition, two improvement options
                                             surfaced as the most feasible options that most efficiently address the excessive
                                             queuing that occurs. Roadway and traffic control improvements have progressed to
                                             a conceptual design stage for the following two options:

                                                  Option 1 - Enhanced Signal Control ­ An enhanced signalized intersection
                                                  consisting of an additional southbound right-turn lane on North Pleasant Street
                                                  and an additional eastbound left-turn lane on Governors Drive. The enhanced
                                                  signal would include vehicle detection on all approaches using stop-line loops
                                                  embedded in the pavement that can detect gaps and shorten or lengthen green
                                                  times as needed to adapt to traffic demands. Pedestrian push buttons would be
                                                  provided on all crossings.

                                                  Option 2 - Roundabout ­ A one-lane roundabout, or circular intersection, where
                                                  all approaches yield to the counterclockwise circulating traffic within the
                                                  roundabout. This is not the same premise as a large diameter, high speed rotary.
                                                  Rather, traffic yields upon entering the roundabout and circulates at a posted
                                                  speed of 20 miles per hour. Bicycles are provided the option of traveling as a
                                                  vehicle or as a pedestrian on the sidewalk.




                                             This chapter presents a side-by-side comparison of both options with regard to traffic
                                             operations, safety, pedestrian/bicycle accommodations, truck maneuverability, right-
                                             of-way, vehicle emissions and fuel consumption, and costs.




3.1 Traffic Operations
                                             Tables 4 and 5 compare an upgraded signal to a one-lane roundabout. Signal
                                             operations were evaluated using SYNCHRO 7 software and the 1-lane roundabout
                                             was evaluated using SIDRA 3.2 software. Both SYNCHRO and SIDRA are based on
                                             industry standard procedures from the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. The
                                             roundabout was also modeled using the VISSIM software.

                                               In addition to estimating the traffic operations of the roundabout using SIDRA and
                                               VISSIM, capacity estimates of roundabouts from the Federal Highway
                                               Administration (FHWA) were referenced along with the observed traffic demands to
                                               ensure that a roundabout is an appropriate traffic control measure given the entering
                                               volumes and the circulating volumes. Based on FHWA guidance and research of
                                               roundabouts in the United States, the roundabout would operate at below 65 percent
                                               of capacity, as shown in the chart below.

                                               Both the enhanced traffic signal and the roundabout are expected to greatly reduce
                                               the excessive queues that occur under the existing intersection configuration.
                                               Comparing the upgraded traffic signal to the roundabout indicates that the
                                               roundabout and enhanced traffic signal are essentially identical in terms of queue

                                             Conclusion: Both Option 1 and Option 2 demonstrate marked improvements over
                                             the existing signal with respect to queues. There is very little difference when
                                             comparing Option 1 with Option 2, both yield similar queue lengths. Option 2
                                             yields lower vehicle delays.

                                             The number of conflict points at the intersection is greatly reduced with a
                                             roundabout when compared to a traffic signal. The fewer conflict points has been
                                             shown to result in fewer crashes for vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Conflict
                                             point reductions are as follows:

                                                  Vehicle conflict points are reduced by 75 percent from 32 (4-way signal) to 8
                                                  (roundabout) for all movements;

                                                     Bicycle conflict points for each approach are reduced by 50 percent from 24 (4-
                                                     way signal) to 12 (roundabout).

                                                Crash Frequency

                                                Comparing a 4-way signalized intersection to a roundabout, the reduction in speeds
                                                and conflict points translates into fewer crashes overall and lower rates of severity.

                                                The FHWA findings from research and before-and-after observations across the
                                                United States have shown a 51 percent reduction in crashes and a 73 percent
                                                reduction in injury-related crashes when comparing a 4-way signalized intersection
                                                to a roundabout. Similar studies by the Maryland DOT show a 68 percent reduction
                                                in total crashes and 86 percent reduction in injury crashes.

                                                The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety revealed the following crash reduction
                                                trends associated with roundabouts compared to signalized intersections:

                                                     32 percent reduction in crashes;
                                                     68 percent reduction in injury crashes;
                                                     30 to 40 percent reduction in pedestrian crashes;
                                                     10 percent reduction in bicycle crashes; and
                                                     90 percent reduction in incapacitating injuries and fatal crashes.

                                                Conclusion: Based on national studies and before-and-after comparisons, the
                                                roundabout under Option 2 is expected to result in safer conditions for vehicles,
                                                pedestrians, and bicyclists when compared to the upgraded signal under Option 1.
                                                This is the direct result of the fewer conflict points and slower speeds associated
                                                with roundabouts.

 3.3 Pedestrians and Bicyclists
                                              While the designs for Option 1 and 2 are still evolving, both will be ADA/AAB
                                              compliant and have improved accommodations for pedestrians and bicyclists
                                              compared to the existing signal. The enhanced signal under Option 1 will include
                                              push buttons and pole mounted pedestrian signals at all four crosswalks. The
                                              roundabout under Option 2 will include sidewalks around the outer edge of the
                                              roundabout with median islands at each approach, spaced approximately one vehicle
                                              length back from the roundabout entry point. As currently envisioned, a grass buffer
                                              will be provided to separate the sidewalk from the travelway.

                                              From the pedestrian survey mentioned in Chapter 2, by far the heaviest pedestrian
                                              directional flow observed was in the vicinity of the northeast corner of the Hamlin
                                              House dormitories ­ where pedestrians traveled between North Pleasant Street and
                                              Eastman Lane. This movement does not require crossing the intersection.

                                               For bicyclists, the roundabout would be designed to accommodate bicyclists within
                                               the roundabout (share the road) or via sidewalk ramps to access the
                                               sidewalk/crosswalks if preferred (wider sidewalks would be provided). As noted in
                                               Chapter 2, approximately half of the bicyclists traveling through the intersection
                                               used the road and half traveled on the sidewalks, and this behavior is expected to
                                               continue with the roundabout under Option 2.

                                             National statistics indicate that for single-lane roundabouts, the number of
                                             pedestrian crashes is about 3 to 4 times less than that of a signalized intersection.
                                             Moreover, the severity of pedestrian crashes is lower for roundabouts than for other
                                             forms of traffic control. Similarly, bicycle crashes are reduced by 10 percent. This is
                                             primarily because roundabouts eliminate left-turns, right-turns, and associated
                                             conflicts common at conventional intersections. Other key several safety-related
                                             features of a roundabout include:


                                                  1.   Slower vehicle speeds that are similar to a bicyclist speed (20 miles per hour);
                                                  2.   Drivers and pedestrians and bicyclists pay more attention to the
                                                       environment at roundabouts; there is no false sense of right-of-way;
                                                  3.   Gaps in the traffic stream are easier to gauge and determine due to the
                                                       slower speeds and the fact that vehicles are only approaching from one
                                                       direction; and

                                                  4.   The crossing distances are shorter with splitter islands serving as a refuge
                                                       area and also making the pedestrian more aware of his/her environment
                                                       (due to the 2-stage crossing).



                                             Conclusion: Based on before-and-after evaluations of signals and roundabouts, the
                                             roundabout under Option 2 is expected to yield more efficient crossings with less
                                             conflict points for pedestrians and bicyclists when compared to the upgraded
                                             signal under Option 1. Vehicle speeds are slower, which has shown to yield fewer
                                             crashes and reduced severity of crashes.




3.4 Trucks/Buses
                                             A key problem with the intersection before the construction activity was the
                                             inadequate turning radius for buses and trucks. The southbound right turn
                                             movement (North Pleasant Street southbound to Governors Drive) was very difficult
                                             for trucks and buses due to the tight radius at this corner of the intersection. If there
                                             was a vehicle on Governors Drive waiting at the signal, the buses/trucks will
                                             encroach over the curb. The current condition of the intersection addresses this issue.

                                             Option 1 and 2 were each designed to accommodate trucks and buses. In addition to
                                             testing large semi-tractor trailers (WB-50 type), vehicle specifications were provided
                                             by the Amherst Fire Department and Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) and
                                             these vehicle types were included in the design review. From the Amherst Fire
                                             Department, an aerial platform truck was tested. Gillig Low Floor Buses (with bicycle
                                             racks) were tested for the PVTA.

                                                trailers, fire trucks, and PVTA buses.

   3.5 Right-of-way
                                                The preliminary layout indicates that both a one-lane roundabout and upgraded
                                                traffic signal could be accommodated within the existing travel way and current
                                                areas of construction.

                                                Conclusion: Based on preliminary designs, there is no difference between Option
                                                1 and Option 2 with regard to right-of-way. There is available right-of-way to
                                                accommodate both options.



   3.6 Sustainability - Vehicle Emissions, Noise,
   and Fuel Consumption
                                                Reducing vehicle delays and greenhouse gas emissions will improve air quality by
                                                reducing the amount of time vehicles are sitting idle at an intersection. Moreover,
                                                fuel consumption is increased with added stopped delays. In addition, vehicles can
                                                create significant noise pollution while idling and accelerating through an
                                                intersection.

                                                The chart below compares the overall vehicle delays under the existing signal (do
                                                nothing option), the upgraded signal (Option 1), and the roundabout (Option 2).
                                                FHWA statistics suggests that given the daily traffic demands at the intersection,
                                                there would be an annual delay reduction of approximately 4,000 vehicle-hours per
                                                year with a roundabout over an upgraded signal.

                                             reduced fuel consumption, the roundabout clearly outperforms the existing and
                                             upgraded traffic signal.

                                             National statistics on roundabout performance confirm that roundabouts
                                             significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption compared to
                                             traffic signals. A 2004 study of roundabouts across the United States found that
                                             roundabouts reduced Carbon Monoxide emissions by 32 percent, Nitrous Oxide
                                             emissions by 34 percent, Carbon Dioxide emissions by 37 percent, Hydrocarbon
                                             emissions by 42 percent, and overall fuel consumption by 30 percent.

                                             A similar study in 2009 by the New York State DOT also found reductions in
                                             greenhouse gas emissions after a detailed before-and-after air quality assessment,
                                             including:

                                                  21 percent reduction in CO2;
                                                  16 percent reduction in NOx;
                                                  19 percent reduction in CO; and
                                                  26 percent reduction in HC.

                                             Conclusion: Option 2 (Roundabout) would yield lower vehicle greenhouse gas
                                             emissions (Carbon Monoxide, Nitrous Oxide, Carbon Dioxide, Hydrocarbons),
                                             noise, and lower fuel consumption when compared to Option 1.



3.7 Costs
                                             Conceptual cost estimates were prepared based on the concept plans for Option 1
                                             and Option 2. These costs are based on MassDOT unit prices for materials and
                                             include a 25 percent contingency to account for utility modifications, signage,
                                             pavement markings, and other costs.

                                             The conceptual construction cost estimate for Option 1, the upgraded traffic signal, is
                                             $495,000. Option 2, the roundabout, has conceptual construction cost estimate of
                                             $480,000.

                                             While Option 1 and 2 have similar construction costs, long-term maintenance and
                                             utility costs associated with Option 2 are notably lower than Option 1. A traffic signal
                                             requires power and regular signal head and controller maintenance estimated at
                                             approximately $5,000 per year. Moreover, the service life of a roundabout is
                                             approximately 25 years compared to a 10 year service life of most signal equipment.

                                             Conclusion: The construction costs of Option 1 and Option 2 are similar. However,
                                             the regular maintenance costs of the roundabout under Option 2 are lower than
                                             Option 1 and the service life of the roundabout exceeds that of most signal
                                             equipment. Thus, over the long term, Option 2 would be preferred from a
                                             maintenance cost perspective over Option 1.

                                             Recommendation and Next Steps

                                             Based on the multimodal evaluation of vehicles, trucks, pedestrians, and
                                             bicyclists, the one-lane roundabout (Option 2) is a more efficient and cost
                                             effective option when compared to an enhanced traffic signal (Option 1).

                                             Under a roundabout, vehicle delays are reduced and emissions and fuel
                                             consumption are reduced. The reduction in vehicle stop-and-start cycles will
                                             yield noise reductions through the roundabout.

                                             Based on national research, the roundabout would provide the added benefit of
                                             improving safety for vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists compared to a traffic
                                             signal. Moreover, the roundabout creates a gateway entrance into the campus
                                             from North Amherst which is important since the character of North Pleasant
                                             Street transitions to a slower, pedestrian-zone at the intersection. The
                                             roundabout serves as an effective transition into this pedestrian-dominated zone
                                             of North Pleasant Street.

                                             The next steps to consider are as follows:

                                                  Review the two options considered with UMASS officials and develop a
                                                  consistent approach and strategy moving forward, identifying either Option
                                                  1 or Option 2 as the preferred approach to bring forward to the Town of
                                                  Amherst for review.

                                                  Present recommendations to the Town of Amherst officials and residents for
                                                  review and comment since the intersection is under the jurisdiction of the
                                                  Town of Amherst. Using the concept plans, initiate the Town planning and
                                                  approval process.

                                                  For the preferred option, initiate detailed engineering design which will be
                                                  used to further advance the planning and approval process as needed.
                                                  Develop construction phasing and maintenance of traffic plans. Update cost
                                                  estimated based on design efforts.

                                                  Initiate public outreach and education campaign. This is critically important
                                                  if the recommended roundabout configuration is selected to dispel the
                                                  perception that a roundabout might function like a rotary.

                          Natalia Landron                                                North Pleasant Street at Governors
                                                                                         Drive/Eastman Lane

              On May 11, 2009, VHB completed a field survey of pedestrian and bicycle activity at the intersection of
              North Pleasant Street at Governors Drive/Eastman Lane. This study was initiated to better understand
              the origin and destination travel patterns of pedestrians and bicyclists which will help during the
              development of interim conditions and pedestrian routing during the upcoming construction activity at
              the intersection. Observations were taken during the morning and afternoon peak periods, 7:00 to 9:00
              AM and 4:00 to 6:00 PM.

              Figure 1 highlights the predominant pedestrian origin-destination pairings through the intersection.
              General observations were as follows:

                  ·      Morning Peak Period. A total of 283 pedestrians and 31 bicyclists were observed during the
                         morning peak period, between 7:00 and 9:00 AM. During the morning, the majority of the
                         pedestrian and bicycle flows travelled southbound on North Pleasant Street and westbound on
                         Governor's Drive.

                  ·      Afternoon Peak Period. A total of 487 pedestrians and 83 bikes were observed during the
                         afternoon peak period, between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. The afternoon peak period is generally busier
                         than the morning peak period. During the afternoon, the flow of pedestrians and bicycles were
                         spread out almost evenly in all directions.

                  ·      Pedestrian flows. By far the heaviest pedestrian directional flow observed was in the vicinity of
                         the northeast corner of Hamlin House dormitories ­ where pedestrians traveled between North
                         Pleasant Street and Eastman Lane. This movement is shown in bold on Figure 1 and did not
                         require crossing the intersection.

                  ·      Bicycle flows. The heaviest bicycle directional flow observed was 12 bicycles in the morning and
                         25 bicycles in the afternoon traveling along North Pleasant Street. During the morning, these 12
                         bicycles were travelling southbound on North Pleasant Street, while in the afternoon the 25
                         bicycles observed were travelling northbound on North Pleasant Street. Bicyclists used both the
                         road and the sidewalks as travel ways, depending on convenience. Approximately 50 percent of
                         the bicyclists used the road and 50 percent used sidewalks. The nearest bike racks to this
                         intersection are located at the Totman Gym building, in front of the GRC building, and at the
                         Hamlin House and Knowlton dormitories.

             ·    Diagonal crossing. Most of the pedestrians who parked their vehicles at the Totman Gym lot
                  were heading towards the back of the Lederle Graduate Research Center (GRC). Most of these
                  pedestrians crossed the intersection diagonally.

             ·    Gateways. The nearest gateways to this intersection are the front entrance doors of the Knowlton,
                  Arnold and Hamlin House buildings and the back door of the GRC building. (The two small
                  classrooms located next to the Totman Gym lot were removed).

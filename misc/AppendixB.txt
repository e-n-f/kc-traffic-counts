 Draft Preserve at Redwood Shores TIA
 September 2007




EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) conducted for the proposed Preserve
Precise Plan in Redwood Shores. The project is approximately located on the north side of Shearwater Parkway
opposite Monaco Drive within the Redwood Shores community of Redwood City, California. The proposed project
includes a new 450-student elementary school, 158 townhomes, and a 3.5 acre neighborhood park. The project is
divided into two development areas: the Preserve which includes the elementary school and 131 townhomes; and
and the Indian Creek development with 27 townhomes and a neighborhood park, which is located off of Marine
Parkway approximately 1,800 feet west of the Preserve development.

Direct access to the plan areas will be provided via four driveways: three at the Preserve development and one
access point for the Indian Creek development. The purpose of the analysis is to identify the likely transportation
impacts of the proposed development on the surrounding roadway system and to identify improvements to
mitigate significant impacts.

Project impacts were estimated following the guidelines of the City of Redwood City and the San Mateo
City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG), which is the congestion management agency for San Mateo
County. The operations of eleven (11) key intersections were evaluated during the morning (AM), afternoon
(AFT), and evening (PM) peak periods under Existing, Background, and Project Conditions. A separate
Cumulative Conditions analysis was not evaluated since the Preserve Precise Plan area is the last developable
land in Redwood Shores, and therefore Project Conditions represent full buildout of Redwood Shores and
Cumulative Conditions for CEQA purposes.

PROJECT TRIPS
Based on the ITE trip generation rates and trip generation surveys conducted for this TIA, it is estimated that the
proposed development would generate 1,770 daily trips, 422 AM peak hour trips, 392 AFT peak hour trips, and 96
PM peak hour trips.

INTERSECTION IMPACTS
Intersection operations are described with the term level of service (LOS). An intersection's LOS can range from
LOS A, free flow operations with little or no delay, to LOS F, stop-and-go operations with excessive delay. The
level of service results for the eleven (11) study intersections are presented in Table ES-1. According to impact
criteria established by the Redwood City and the San Mateo City/County of Governments (C/CAG), none of study
intersections are expected to have a significant impact.

FREEWAY SEGMENT AND RAMP IMPACTS
Based on the C/CAG's Congestion Management Program guidelines, the project is not expected to have a
significant impact on the freeway study segments on US 101. Similarly, the project is expected to have a less-
than-significant impact on the freeway ramps studied for this TIA.

TRANSIT, BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN IMPACTS
The project may cause a potentially significant pedestrian and bicycle impact on Shearwater Parkway fronting the
project site, since the proposed land uses are expected to generate an increase in pedestrian and bicycle activity
that cannot be accommodated by the current pedestrian facilities near the project site.


                                                                                                                 iii

Thus, we recommend that sidewalks be provided on the east side of Shearwater Parkway east of Monaco Drive
and west of the western most school driveway for pedestrian connectivity to the adjacent land uses. Additionally,
a crosswalk should be provided at the intersection of Shearwater Parkway and Monaco Drive, since the
intersection at Shearwater Parkway and Monaco Drive will serve at the primary pedestrian and bicycle crossing to
the school site from the adjacent residential development. We recommend that the intersection be textured and
included colored paving. As an alternative to the Shearwater Parkway and Monaco Drive crosswalk, a crosswalk
could be provided at the easternmost school driveway to provide pedestrian and bicycle connectivity to the project
site. Similar to the Shearwater Parkway and Monoco Drive intersection recommendations, this intersection should
be textured and colored to increase driver awareness of potential pedestrians crossing Shearwater Parkway.
Additionally, we recommend other traffic control devices to alert drivers of pedestrians in the crosswalk. These
features could include, but are not limited to a raised crosswalk, in pavement lighting, signage, and/or flashing
beacons. This treatment will serve as a visual cue for drivers to slow down and increase driver awareness of
potential pedestrians or bicyclists crossing Shearwater Parkway at the school driveway. These improvements
would reduce the potential impact to a less-than-significant level.

The project is projected to have a less-than-significant impact on the transit system.

TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
C/CAG requires that a project estimated to generate 100 or more net new trips during the AM or PM peak hours
must develop a transportation demand management (TDM) program that has the capacity to fully reduce the
demand for the project's net new trips generated on the CMP network. The TDM elements for the Preserve
Precise Plan include incentives that encourage the use of alternative modes of travel, and all of the measures
satisfy C/CAG guidelines. During the AM peak hour, the project is projected to generate a total of 422 AM peak
hour trips, of which 82 result from the proposed residential developments and 340 trips related to the proposed
Elementary School. However, given the nature of the operations of an elementary school and the type of trips
generated, the Preserve's sample TDM program will not be able to reduce all of the 422 AM peak hour trips. The
project is estimated to generate 96 PM peak hour trips, which is less than C/CAG's 100 peak hour trip threshold.
A total of 63 peak hour trips can be reduced with the implementation of the sample TDM program provided in
Chapter 6.

SITE ACCESS, ON-SITE CIRCULATION, AND PARKING
Site access to the Preserve development site will be provided via three driveways including one for the
townhouse development, and two for the elementary school. The project proposes to align the residential
driveway with the existing Monaco Court intersection for access to Shearwater Parkway.

The Indian Creek development is proposed to have access to the site via the existing driveway at Salt Court,
which is a four-way stop intersection. This alignment would avoid an additional intersection on Marine Parkway.
One driveway is considered adequate to serve project-generated traffic.

The primary concern with the project's site access and circulation is in regards to the proposed elementary
school. The basis for the design of circulation at the school is existing operations at Sandpiper Elementary School
and our experience with school site traffic studies. The project proposes to provide an extensive pick-up and drop-
off area separate from Shearwater Parkway and school parking facilities to accommodate traffic flow and
encourage parents to enter and leave the site without parking. The proposed loading area is approximately 350
feet long with a storage capacity of 14 vehicles and extends parallel to Shearwater Parkway in front of the
elementary school. The pick-up and drop-off area functions as a one-way street with the entrance provided at the
eastern driveway and an exit provided at the western driveway.

The entrance and exit driveways to the loading area will be side-street stop controlled and will permit all turning
possible movements. To discourage pedestrians and bicyclists from crossing drop-off and pick-up area access
points, it is recommended that no crosswalks at Shearwater Parkway be provided across the driveway
intersections. Additionally, we recommend that no sidewalk be provided along Shearwater Parkway in front of the
loading area to: 1) minimize conflict points between pedestrians and vehicles, and 2) reduce the likelihood of
drop-off activities on Shearwater Parkway by drivers avoiding queues in the on-site loading area. Based on the
current site the project is considering a sidewalk between the two school driveways. If a sidewalk is provided at
this location, we recommend that the sidewalk be physically separated from the roadway and separated by low-
level landscaping to discourage use of Shearwater Parkway as a passenger loading zone.

1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed Preserve project in
Redwood Shores. The project is approximately located on the north side of Shearwater Parkway opposite
Monaco Drive within the Redwood Shores community in Redwood City, California. The proposed project includes
a new 450-student elementary school, 158 townhouses, and a 3.5 acre neighborhood park. The project is divided
into two development areas: the Preserve, which includes the proposed elementary school and 131 townhomes;
and the Indian Creek development with 27 townhomes and a neighborhood park, which is located off of Marine
Parkway approximately 1,800 feet west of the Preserve development.

The purpose of the analysis is to identify potential impacts of the proposed project on the surrounding
transportation system, and to recommend appropriate improvements to mitigate significant impacts. A map of the
project site location is presented on Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the conceptual site plan of the proposed project with
access to the site from three driveways on Shearwater Parkway and one on Marine Parkway.

The traffic impacts were evaluated following guidelines of the City of Redwood City and the San Mateo
City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG), which is the congestion management agency (CMA) for San
Mateo County. Existing and future conditions were evaluated with level of service calculations for the following
key intersections near the project site:

    1. Marine Parkway/Twin Dolphin Drive

    2. Marine Parkway/Bridge Parkway

    3. Marine Parkway/Shell Parkway

    4. Marine Parkway/Salt Court

    5. Shearwater Parkway/Monaco Drive

    6. Shearwater Parkway/Canvasback Way

    7. Shearwater Parkway/Redwood Shores Parkway

    8. Redwood Shores Parkway/Shell Parkway

    9. Redwood Shores Parkway/Bridge Parkway

    10. Redwood Shores Parkway/Twin Dolphin Drive

    11. Marine Parkway/Oracle Parkway/Shoreway Road

In addition to intersections, the following freeway segments and freeway interchanges/ramps near the project site
were analyzed for potential traffic impacts:

    U.S. 101 Freeway Segments:

        ·   US 101 - North of Marine Parkway-Ralston Road

        ·   US 101 - Marine Parkway-Ralston Avenue to Redwood Shores/Holly Street

        ·   US 101 - South of Redwood Shores-Holly Street

                                                                                                                  1

    U.S. 101 Freeway Interchanges/Ramps:

        ·   U.S. 101/Redwood Shores-Holly Street

        ·   U.S. 101/Marine Parkway-Ralston Avenue

The operations of the key intersections, freeway segments, and freeway interchanges/ramps were evaluated
during the morning (AM), and evening (PM) peak traffic periods. The project proposes to construct a new
elementary school. School peak conditions usually occur during the morning and afternoon from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00
a.m. and from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., respectively. Therefore, the key intersections were also analyzed during the
mid-afternoon (AFT) when school traffic is highest. The analysis was conducted for the following scenarios:

        Scenario 1:      Existing Conditions. Existing volumes obtained from counts, representing peak one-hour
                         traffic conditions during the morning and afternoon commute periods.

        Scenario 2:      Background Conditions. Existing peak-hour volumes plus traffic from approved but not
                         yet constructed developments in the area. This scenario is the basis for which project
                         impacts are determined.

        Scenario 3:      Project Conditions. Background peak-hour traffic volumes plus project traffic generated
                         by the proposed project. Since the proposed project will effectively complete buildout of
                         Redwood Shores, this scenario also serves as an evaluation of Cumulative Conditions for
                         the project.

The remainder of this report is divided into four chapters. Chapter 2 describes Existing Conditions regarding
roadway facilities, transit services, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, traffic volumes, and operating conditions of
the key intersections. Intersection operations under Background Conditions with traffic from approved but not yet
constructed developments are discussed in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 describes the method used to estimate the
project traffic and its impacts on the transportation system. Other operational issues, including site access, on-site
circulation, and parking, are discussed in this chapter. Additionally, this chapter discusses three project
alternatives for the project site and compares the trip generation estimates. The implementation of a
Transportation Demand Management Plan is presented in Chapter 5.

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the existing conditions of the roadway facilities, traffic volumes, intersection operations,
transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. This chapter also includes a discussion of the method used to
calculate intersection levels of service and the corresponding results.

ROADWAY NETWORK
US 101 provides regional access to the project site. Marine Parkway, Redwood Shores Parkway, and Shearwater
Parkway provide local access to the site. Descriptions of these roadway facilities are presented below.

US 101 is a north-south freeway that extends north along the peninsula of the San Francisco Bay Area through
San Francisco. To the south, US 101 extends through San Jose. Near the project site, U.S. 101 provides four
mixed-flow lanes in each direction north of Redwood Shores-Holly Street. South of Redwood Shores-Holly Street,
U.S. 101 provides four mixed-flow lanes and one auxiliary lane in each direction. The interchanges at Redwood
Shores Parkway-Holly Street and Marine Parkway-Ralston Avenue provide access to the project site.

Marine Parkway is an east-west roadway that extends from US 101 to Shearwater Parkway in the east. Between
US 101 and Cork Harbour Circle, Marine Parkway is six-lane arterial. East of Cork Harbour Circle, Marine
Parkway narrows to a four-lane collector street. The posted speed limit is 35 miles per hour (mph).

Redwood Shores Parkway is an east-west roadway that parallels Marine Parkway and extends from US 101 to
Shearwater Parkway in the east. Bridge Parkway and Shell Parkway are the major collector roads that provide
direct connections between Marine Parkway and Redwood Shores Parkway. Between US 101 and Bridge
Parkway, Redwood Shores Parkway is six-lane arterial, while east of Bridge Parkway it narrows to a four-lane
collector street. The posted speed limit is 35 miles per hour (mph).

Shearwater Parkway is a east-west four-lane collector street that connects Marine Parkway and Redwood Shores
Parkway at the eastern side of Redwood Shores. Shearwater Parkway narrows to two lanes west of Monaco
Drive and expands back to four lanes at Marine Parkway after crossing an existing bridge. The posted speed-limit
is 35 mph to the east of Monaco Drive and 25 mph west of Monaco Drive at the bridge crossing.

EXISTING TRANSIT SERVICE
The San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) operates transit service in Redwood City. Figure 3 shows the
existing bus routes near the project site. These bus routes are described below:

Route 260 provides bus service between the San Carlos CalTrain Station and College of San Mateo. Within
Redwood Shores, it operates along Marine Parkway, Bridge Parkway, Redwood Shores Parkway, and
Shearwater Parkway. Near the project site, bus stops are located just east and west of Monaco Drive. During
weekday service Route 260 operates with 30-minute headways between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., while on the
weekends Route 260 has 60-minute headways between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.

Route NX is an express bus route that provides service from Redwood Shores, to the San Mateo US 101/SR 92
Park & Ride lot and to downtown San Francisco. The NX express route runs twice in the morning to downtown
San Francisco and twice in the afternoon returning to Redwood Shores. No weekend service is provided.

In addition, SamTrans provides paratransit service to those individuals who cannot independently use regular bus
service. Redi-Wheels, SamTrans' paratransit service, serves San Mateo County, plus select surrounding cities
and operates seven days a week from 5:30 a.m. to midnight, with 24 hour service available in some areas.

EXISTING PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE FACILITIES
Pedestrian facilities consist of sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals at signalized intersections. Near the
project site, sidewalks are provided as part of a multi-use path on the south side of Shearwater Parkway. (The
multi-use path is described in more detail in the next paragraph). On the north side of Shearwater Parkway a
short segment of sidewalk is provided at Canvasback Way, approximately 0.2 miles east of the project site. The
closest crosswalk is also provided at Canvasback Way. Currently there are no crosswalks that cross Shearwater
Parkway at Monaco Drive.

Additionally, the San Francisco Bay Trail, a regional walking and biking trail network, runs through the project site.
The trail connects the site to the remainder of Redwood Shores before continuing north and south along the San
Francisco Peninsula.

Bicycle facilities include bike paths, bike lanes, and bike routes. Bike paths (Class I facilities) are paved pathways
that are separated from the roadways. Bike lanes (Class II facilities) are lanes on roadways designated for use by
bicycles with special lane markings, pavement legends, and signs. Bike routes (Class III facilities) are roadways
that are designated for bicycle use with signs. Redwood Shores provided a continuous bike and pedestrian multi-
use path that circles Redwood Shores along the inner loop of Marine Parkway, Shearwater Parkway, and
Redwood Shores Parkway. Near the project site there are no designated bike lanes or bike routes.

Existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities are shown on Figure 4.

EXISTING INTERSECTION TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND LANE CONFIGURATIONS
In conformance with standard engineering practices, the operations of the key intersections were evaluated
during weekday morning (AM) and evening (PM) peak-hour traffic conditions. Since the proposed project includes
a new elementary school, the key intersections were also analyzed during the mid-afternoon (AFT) when school
traffic is highest. School peak conditions usually occur during the morning and afternoon from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00
a.m. and from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., respectively. Intersection operations were evaluated for the one-hour
segment with the highest volumes during each of these periods.

Turning movement volume counts for all but one intersection were conducted in November 2006. Counts for
Marine Parkway/Oracle Parkway/Shoreway Road were conducted in March 2007 and August 2007 (see Appendix
A). Figure 5 presents existing intersection lane configurations and traffic control devices. Figure 6 shows the
existing peak-hour turning movement volumes at the eleven study intersections.

LEVEL OF SERVICE METHODS
The operations of roadway facilities are described with the term level of service. Level of Service (LOS) is a
qualitative description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver.
Six levels are defined from LOS A, as the best operating conditions, to LOS F, or the worst operating conditions.
LOS E represents "at-capacity" operations. When volumes exceed capacity, stop-and-go conditions result, and
operations are designated as LOS F. Two methods were used to evaluate the key study intersections: one
method for the signalized intersections and another method for the unsignalized intersections.

Signalized Intersections

The level of service method approved by Redwood City and the San Mateo City/County Association of
Governments (C/CAG) analyzes the operations of a signalized intersection based on average control vehicular
delay calculated using the method described in Chapter 16 of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) (Special
Report 209, Transportation Research Board). Control delay includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up
time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. The average control delay for signalized intersections is
calculated using TRAFFIX analysis software and is correlated with a LOS designation as shown in Table 1.

The level of service standard (i.e., minimum acceptable operations) for signalized intersections in the City of
Redwood City is LOS D. None of the study intersections are C/CAG designated intersections, and therefore are
not evaluated under C/CAG's defined minimum acceptable level of service.

Unsignalized Intersections

Operations of the unsignalized study intersections were evaluated using the method contained in Chapter 17 of
the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. Similar to signalized intersections, Level of Service ratings for four-way stop-
controlled intersections are based on the average control delay for the entire intersection expressed in seconds
per vehicle. At two-way or side street stop-controlled intersections, the control delay is calculated for each
controlled movement, rather than for the intersection as a whole. For single lane approaches, the control delay is
computed as the average of all movements in that lane. For all-way stop-controlled locations, a weighted average
delay for the entire intersection is presented. Table 2 summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for
unsignalized intersections.


                                                                                                                 11

Freeway Segments and Interchanges/Ramps

To evaluate project impacts on freeway segments and interchanges/ramps, a capacity analysis was conducted by
calculating volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. V/C ratios are calculated for each freeway segment's direction of
travel and interchange/ramp. V/C ratios are calculated by dividing traffic volumes for each segment by the
capacity of the segment. Based on Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines, the capacity for freeway
segments is estimated as the number of lanes multiplied by 2,200 vehicles per hour per lane four four-lane
freeway segments and 2,300 vehicles per hour per lane for segments with six or more lanes. Freeway
interchanges/ramp capacities presented in Chapter 25 of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual were used based
on the free-flow speed and number of lanes on the study ramps

EXISTING INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Existing intersection lane configurations and peak-hour turning movement volumes were used to calculate the
AM, AFT, and PM peak-hour levels of service for the study intersections. The results of the LOS calculations for
Existing Conditions are summarized in Table 3. The corresponding calculation sheets are contained in Appendix
B.

Measured against the City of Redwood City's level of service standard (LOS D or better), all signalized and
unsignalized study intersections operate at an acceptable level of service during under Existing Conditions, with
the exception of the Redwood Shores Parkway/Bridge Parkway intersection. This intersection currently operates
at LOS E during the AM peak hour.

EXISTING FREEWAY SEGMENT LEVELS OF SERVICE
Traffic conditions along county freeways are periodically reported by the San Mateo City and County Association
of Governments (C/CAG) as part of their Congestion Management Program (CMP). Existing freeway segment
operating levels were obtained from the 2005 San Mateo County CMP Monitoring Report (Fehr & Peers, 2006).
The operating levels presented in the CMP Monitoring Report are based on travel time surveys and the LOS is
correlated to speed. Existing morning and evening peak-hour freeway operating conditions are presented in Table
4.

Per C/CAG guidelines, a capacity of 2,300 vehicles per lane is assumed for divided freeways with four or more
lanes. The freeway study segments near the project site have four lanes in each direction, resulting in a capacity
of 9,200 vehicles.

EXISTING FREEWAY RAMP LEVELS OF SERVICE
To analyze the freeway ramps near the project site, a volume-to-capacity analysis was conducted to determine if
the ramps have sufficient capacity to serve expected demand. Capacities presented in Chapter 25 of the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual were used based on the free-flow speed of the study ramps. Based on the analysis all
freeway ramp/interchanges have excess capacity under Existing Conditions. Table 5 summarizes the results of
the freeway ramp/interchange capacity analysis.

FIELD OBSERVATIONS
Field observations of the study intersections and roadway network near the project site were conducted during the
morning and afternoon peak hours in November 2006. The intersections were generally observed to operate at
the calculated levels of service for each peak period.

In general, congestion in Redwood Shores is directional depending on the peak period and the location within
Redwood Shores. The eastern part of Redwood Shores is primary residential development, while a high
concentration of office park developments exists in the west near US 101. Therefore during the AM peak hour,
Marine Parkway and Redwood Shores Parkway between Bridge Parkway and Shearwater Parkway are more
congested in the westbound direction as residents leave to access employment places in the west. Alternatively,
Marine Parkway and Redwood Shores Parkway west of Bridge Parkway are more congested in the eastbound
direction during the AM peak hour with employees accessing employment centers around Twin Dolphin Drive.

                                                                                                              15
 Draft Preserve at Redwood Shores TIA

Overall, in the afternoon congestion is lighter as compared the AM peak period, with a higher concentration of
congestion in the western part of Redwood Shores.

During the AM peak hour, congestion occurred at specific intersections. At the Marine Parkway/Twin Dolphin
Drive intersection, the eastbound through movement frequently had queues of 15 or more cars in the median
through lane, which queued back to the next intersection at Shoreway Road. However, the queue at this
intersection generally was observed to clear within one cycle. At the Redwood Shores Parkway/Bridge Parkway
intersection, the eastbound through movement experienced queues of 10 or more vehicles when a platoon of
eastbound traffic arrived. This intersection is a four-way stop, and without the opposing eastbound traffic,
westbound traffic was generally observed to treat the intersection as a "yield" condition, which resulted in shorter
queues and delays. Additionally, queues of five to ten cars were observed on the eastbound left turn movement at
the Redwood Shores/Twin Dolphin Drive intersection with vehicles accessing the Shores Center Office Complex.
These queues were generally observed to clear within one cycle.

During the AFT peak hour, congestion at the study intersections was generally lower. The highest traffic volumes
were observed at the Twin Dolphin Drive intersections at Marine Parkway and at Redwood Shores Parkway in the
eastbound direction with employees returning from lunch-time destinations. Additionally, higher traffic volumes
were observed at Redwood Shores Parkway and Shell Parkway in both directions with traffic resulting from
parents picking up students at end of the school day at nearby Sandpiper Elementary School.

In the PM peak hour, the heaviest congestion was observed at the Marine Parkway/Twin Dolphin Drive and
Redwood Shores/Twin Dolphin Drive intersections. The northbound left-turn movement at Marine Parkway/Twin
Dolphin Drive had queues of 15 or more vehicles per lane. Westbound vehicles arrived in platoons from the
downstream intersection and frequently had queues of nearly 10 vehicles per lane. Queues were generally
observed to clear within one cycle on all movements at the Marine Parkway/Twin Dolphin Drive intersection. At
the Redwood Shores Parkway/Twin Dolphin Drive the eastbound and westbound through movements
consistently had queues of 10 vehicles per lane; though the queues were observed to clear within one cycle.
Similar to the morning observations at Redwood Shores Parkway/Bridge Parkway intersection, vehicles traveling
in the eastbound direction arrived at the four-way stop intersection in platoons of five to eight cars. Vehicles
frequently treated the intersection as "yield", when no opposing traffic was present. Overall, volumes at the
Redwood Shores Parkway/Bridge Parkway intersection were lower in the PM as compared to the AM.

Near the project site at the intersection of Shearwater Parkway and Monaco Drive, no major queuing was
observed. Traffic on Shearwater Parkway was heavier in the westbound direction during the morning peak hour,
while volumes where higher in the eastbound direction in the evening peak hour. During the afternoon peak hour
traffic was lower fairly even in both directions. Very low volumes were observed traveling northbound on Monaco
Drive during all three periods analyzed for this TIA.

3. BACKGROUND CONDITIONS
This chapter presents the level of service analysis results for the study intersections and freeway segments under
Background Conditions. Background Conditions are defined as conditions (traffic volume and intersection
geometry) prior to completion of the proposed project and serves as the basis to identify project impacts.
Background traffic volumes include existing volumes, and traffic generated by approved developments near the
project site.

BACKGROUND TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
Estimated background traffic volumes consist of existing volumes and traffic generated by approved but not yet
constructed and occupied developments as of November 2006 near the project site. These developments
primarily included vacant office spaces within Redwood Shores. The list of approved projects in Appendix C was
developed with input from City of Redwood City planning staff. The traffic from the approved developments was
obtained from traffic impact reports prepared for each development, or estimated with Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates and standard engineering practice. The trips associated with each
development were then assigned to the roadway network based on the relative locations of complementary land
uses and existing and estimated future travel patterns. Figure 7 illustrates the traffic volumes at the study
intersections under Background Conditions.

BACKGROUND ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
Redwood City staff does not anticipate any near-term intersection improvements before the completion of the
Preserve project. However, unfunded roadway projects under consideration include the Blomquist Street
extension over Redwood Creek, and improvements to the US 101 and Woodside Road interchange.

BACKGROUND INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Intersection level of service calculations were conducted to estimate the operations of the study intersections
under Background Conditions. Table 6 presents the results. The corresponding LOS calculation sheets are
included in Appendix B.

Measured against the City of Redwood City's level of service standard, all signalized and unsignalized study
intersections operate at an acceptable level of service (LOS D or better) during one or both of the peak hours
under Background Conditions except, the Redwood Shores Parkway/Bridge Parkway intersection, which is
estimated to operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour.

BACKGROUND FREEWAY SEGMENT CAPACITY ANALYSIS
Existing freeway segment operations shown in Table 4 are based on speed and travel time surveys from the 2005
San Mateo County CMP Monitoring Report. Since speed cannot be projected under future conditions
(Background or otherwise), a capacity analysis was used as a baseline for identifying potential project impacts to
the freeway system. A capacity of 2,300 vehicles per lane per hour was used to estimate the capacity of the
mixed-flow lanes on U.S. 101. (The percentage of HOVs on U.S. 101 from the Measures of Effectiveness report
presented in the U.S. 101 Auxiliary Lane Project Study (Fehr & Peers, November 2000) was used to estimate the
number of vehicles using the HOV lanes instead of the mixed-flow lanes.)

Since the completion of the 2005 San Mateo County CMP Monitoring Report (Fehr & Peers, 2006), the U.S. 101
auxiliary lane project, which added an auxiliary lane in each direction on U.S. 101 between Holly Street and
Woodside Road (SR 84), has been completed and, therefore, is included under the background freeway analysis.
South of Whipple Avenue in the study area, U.S. 101 has one HOV lane, three mixed-flow lanes, and one
auxiliary lane in each direction. North of Whipple Avenue, U.S. 101 has four mixed-flow lanes and one auxiliary
lane (no HOV lanes) in each direction.1 The addition of auxiliary lanes under this scenario improves operations
compared to previously reported existing conditions, as shown in Table 4.

Vehicles in the mixed-flow lanes wishing to exit the freeway via the auxiliary lane will occupy capacity in the
mixed-flow lanes of US 101 for a portion of each study segment. Additionally, vehicles entering the freeway from
the auxiliary lanes will occupy capacity in the mixed-flow lanes of US 101 for a portion of each study segment. For
the mixed-flow lane capacity analysis, it was assumed that half of the total vehicles using the auxiliary lane would
use capacity on the mainline section of US 101. The results of the freeway segment capacity analysis are
summarized Table 7.

The results that, during both peak hours that all mixed-flow freeway study segments have volumes that do not
exceed their capacity (V/C < 1.0).

  The high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes south of Whipple Avenue were not analyzed because a negligible number of project trips are
expected to utilize these lanes on the freeway segments under study. The HOV lanes are located in the center of the freeway, while project
traffic will be using the outside lanes to enter and exit the freeway.

BACKGROUND FREEWAY RAMP CAPACITY ANALYSIS
To verify that the study freeway ramps at the Redwood Shores-Holly Street and Marine Parkway-Ralston Avenue
interchanges would have sufficient capacity to serve the projected demand, a volume-to-capacity analysis was
conducted for each of the study ramps. For the purpose of this analysis, capacities presented in Chapter 25 of the
2000 Highway Capacity Manual were used based on the free-flow speed of the study ramps. Table 8 presents the
results from the ramp capacity analysis.

The results of the freeway ramp capacity analysis indicate that all of the freeway study ramps have volumes that
are less than their capacity (V/C  1.0) during both peak hours under Background Conditions.

4. PROJECT CONDITIONS
The impacts of the proposed development on the surrounding transportation system are discussed in this chapter.
First, the method used to estimate the amount of traffic generated by the proposed project is described. Then,
results of the level of service calculations for Project Conditions are presented. Project Conditions are defined as
Background Conditions plus traffic generated by the proposed project. Project impacts are identified by comparing
the LOS results under Project Conditions to those under Background Conditions.

PROJECT TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
The amount of traffic associated with a project is estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip
distribution, and (3) trip assignment. In the first step, the amounts of traffic entering and exiting the project site are
estimated on a daily and peak-hour basis. In the second step, the directions the trips use to approach and depart
the site are estimated. The trips are assigned to specific street segments and intersection turning movements in
the third step. The results of this process for this analysis are described in the following sections.

Trip Generation

The proposed project includes the development of 158 townhouses (131 in the Preserve and 27 in the Indian
Creek development) and a 450-student elementary school. The amount of traffic generated by the proposed
townhouse developments was estimated by applying the daily trip rates, morning and evening peak hour
percentages, as well as inbound/outbound splits for Condo/Townhouse (ITE Land Use Code 230) published in the
Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation, 7th Edition. Afternoon residential trip generation rates were
developed based on surveys conducted at similar developments in the Bay Area (Fehr & Peers, November 2006)
and compared to other reports.2

The amount of traffic generated by the proposed elementary school was developed based on field observations at
the existing Sandpiper Elementary School in Redwood Shores. Sandpiper elementary school has 450 students,
and therefore has similar characteristics as the proposed Preserve Elementary School.

In addition to the elementary school and residential developments, the project proposes to develop a 3.5 acre
neighborhood park and expand the existing parking lot at the northern corner of Shearwater Parkway and Marine
Parkway. The parking lot currently has six parking spaces and provides access to the San Francisco Bay Trail.
The estimated amount of traffic generated from the neighborhood park is negligible and was not included in the
project trip generation estimates for the proposed project.

Based on the corresponding trip generation rates shown in Table 9, the proposed development would generate
1,770 daily trips, 422 AM peak hour trips (218 inbound and 204 outbound), 392 AFT peak hour net new trips (161
inbound and 231 outbound), and 96 PM peak hour trips (64 inbound and 32 outbound).




2
 The trip generation rates for the Indian Creek development are slightly higher than those for the Preserve Development, since trip generation
are based on the fitted curve equation published in the ITE Trip Generation Manual (2003), and not the average rates.

                                                                                                                                           23

Trip Distribution

The trip distribution pattern for the proposed residential developments was estimated based on complementary
land uses (e.g., employment and shopping areas) and 2000 Census Journey to Work data. The Preserve and
Sandpiper elementary schools will only serve students from Redwood Shores. Trip distribution for the Elementary
School is based on the assumption that the Preserve School will primarily serve the northeastern population,
while the Sandpiper Elementary school will serve the south eastern student population of Redwood Shores. The
major directions of approach and departure for the project site are shown on Figure 8.

A sensitivity analysis is presented later in this chapter to identify potential intersection impacts if the Belmont-
Redwood Shores School District implements different district boundaries for the two elementary schools.

Trip Assignment

Trips generated by the proposed project were assigned to the roadway system based on the directions of
approach and departure described above.

According to the Belmont-Redwood Shores School District, approximately 101 Kindergarteners from Redwood
Shores currently attend Nesbit Elementary School near Ralston Avenue in Belmont, California. Once the new
Preserve Elementary School is constructed, the District expects that all of Redwood Shore's K-5 students will
attend either the Sandpiper or new Preserve Elementary School. Therefore the trips generated for the 101
Kindergarteners that attend Nesbit Elementary School were reassigned to the roadway network assuming they
will attend the new Preserve Elementary School under Project Conditions. Access for Redwood Shore's K-5
students to school internally eliminates additional vehicles trips to alternate schools outside of Redwood Shores,

volumes to estimate volumes under Project Conditions, which are illustrated on Figures 10.

PROJECT INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Intersection level of service calculations were conducted to evaluate the operating conditions of the intersections
with project traffic and the potential impacts of the proposed project on the local roadway system. The results of
the intersection LOS calculations for Background and for Project Conditions are presented in Table 10. The
increases in critical movement delays due to the addition of project traffic are also shown in Table 10.

Measured against the City of Redwood City's level of service standard, all signalized and unsignalized study
intersections operate at an acceptable level of service (LOS D or better) during one or both of the peak hours
under Project Conditions, except the intersection of Redwood Shores Parkway and Bridge Parkway during the
AM peak period.

Freeway Segments

Study segments of US 101 were analyzed during the AM and PM peak hours to determine if a significant amount
of project traffic would be added to these freeway segments. This analysis was conducted to identify potential
near-term freeway impacts. Since the freeway study segments are projected to operate at acceptable LOS E
under Background Conditions a volume-to-capacity (v/c) analysis was done to identify potential impacts. The
results of the freeway segment capacity analysis are summarized in Table 11.

The results of the freeway segment capacity analysis indicate that on all study segments the volume of vehicles in
the mixed-flow lanes do not exceed the freeway segment capacity (V/C < 1.0) during the AM peak period.

Freeway Ramps

Similar the to study freeway segments, a volume-to-capacity analysis was conducted for the study ramps of U.S.
101 to determine if they would have sufficient capacity to serve projected demand under Project Conditions. For
the purpose of this analysis, capacities presented Chapter 25 of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual were used
based on their free-flow speed of the study ramps.

The results of the freeway ramp capacity analysis indicate that on all study ramps the volume of vehicles do not
exceed the freeway ramps capacity (V/C  1.0), during both peak periods under Project Conditions. The results of
the ramp capacity analysis are presented in Table 12.

PROJECT IMPACT CRITERIA
To evaluate a broad range of travel characteristics, the following standards of significance apply to the
transportation impacts discussed in this study. These standards are consistent with other recent transportation
impact studies conducted for projects in Redwood City.

Signalized Intersection Impacts

According to Redwood City standards, traffic impacts at signalized intersections would occur if the project would
cause:

        ·   Operations at a signalized intersection to deteriorate from an acceptable level (LOS D or better) to an
            unacceptable level (LOS E or F); or

        ·   The average delay at signalized intersections operating at an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) to
            increase by five or more seconds.

Unsignalized Intersection Impacts

According to Redwood City standards, traffic impacts at unsignalized intersections would occur if the project
would cause:

        ·   Operations at an unsignalized intersection to deteriorate from an acceptable level (LOS D or better) to
            an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) and either:

                1) the traffic volumes at the intersection satisfy the Peak Hour Volume warrant for traffic signal
                   installation, or

                2) the delay to increase by five seconds or more; or

        ·   The delay at an unsignalized intersection operating at an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) to increase
            by five or more seconds and the traffic volumes at the intersection satisfy the Peak Hour Volume
            warrant for traffic signal installation.

Freeway Segment and Ramp Impacts

Based on CMP guidelines, the project would have an impact on a freeway if one of the two conditions occurs:

       ·    The project causes the freeway level of service to exceed the adopted LOS standard for that facility,
            or

       ·    If the freeway segment already exceeds the LOS standard:

               1)   The project adds traffic equal to one percent of the capacity, or

               2)   Causes a freeway segment's volume-to-capacity ratio to increase by one percent.

Based on common CEQA practices, the proposed project is considered to result in a significant freeway ramp
capacity impact if its implementation causes the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) of the freeway ramp to exceed 1.0.




                                                                                                                32

Transit, Bicycle and Pedestrian Impacts

The proposed project is considered to result in a significant transit, bicycle, and/or pedestrian impact if its
implementation:

        ·   conflicts with any existing, planned, or possible future transit, bicycle and/or pedestrian facilities and
            services, or

        ·   adds demand to one of these modes that is not adequately accommodated by appropriate facilities or
            services.

INTERSECTION, ROADWAY SEGMENT, AND FREEWAY SEGMENT IMPACTS
Signalized Intersections

Measured against the City of Redwood City's level of service standard, all signalized intersections are projected
to operate at acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better) under Project Conditions. Therefore the project would
have a less-than-significant impact at all signalized study intersections.

Unsignalized Intersections

Measured against the City of Redwood City's level of service standard, all unsignalized study intersections
operate at an acceptable level of service (LOS D or better) during one or both of the peak hours under Project
Conditions except, the Redwood Shores Parkway and Bridge Parkway intersection during the morning peak
period.

In the morning peak hour, the addition of project traffic is expected to exacerbate an unacceptable level of service
at the Redwood Shores Parkway/Bridge Parkway intersection. The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD, 2003) Peak-Hour Volume signal warrant is satisfied during the morning peak period. However, as
compared to Background Conditions, the average intersection delay is expected to increase by less than five
seconds. Therefore, the proposed project would have a less-than-significant impact at the Redwood Shores
Parkway and Bridge Parkway intersection during the AM peak hour. The calculation sheets for the signal warrant
analysis are presented in Appendix D.

Freeway Segments

Traffic generated by the proposed project is expected to add less than one percent of each freeway segment's
capacity and is not expected to result in unacceptable operations (V/C > 1.0). Based on the significance criteria,
the proposed project would have less-than-significant impact on the nearby freeway segments under Project
Conditions.

Freeway Ramps

The freeway ramps are not projected to exceed the volume-to-capacity significance threshold (V/C  1.0) with the
addition of project traffic. Therefore, the proposed project would have less-than-significant on the nearby
freeway ramps under Project Conditions.




                                                                                                                   33

PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE, AND TRANSIT IMPACTS
Pedestrian Facilities

Currently, sidewalks are provided on the south side of Shearwater Parkway near the project site. The closest
crosswalk is approximately 0.2 miles east at Canvasback Way. Since, the proposed project includes the
construction of a new elementary school, the potential for a substantial increase in pedestrian activity is high, and
no facilities are available to serve this demand. Thus, this is considered a potentially significant pedestrian
impact.

The proposed project incorporates the existing San Francisco trail into the site plan and therefore has no
significant impact on the San Francisco Trail development.

Bicycle Facilities

The proposed project is expected to generate new bicycle traffic that cannot be accommodated by the current
bicycle facilities provided near the project site. Therefore, the project is expected to result in a potentially
significant bicycle impact on Shearwater Parkway near the school site.

Transit Service

A bus stop is located on both sides of Shearwater Parkway near the project site. Both Route 260 and the NX
express bus serve this stop. Route 260 serves this stop with 30 to 60-minute headways between the hours of
6:00 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. on weekdays, while Route NX only serves the stop twice during the morning and evening
peak hours. The projected transit demand for the proposed project is low and therefore the impact to transit
service is considered less-than-significant.

MITIGATION MEASURES
The project is projected to have less-than-significant impacts at the study intersections, freeway segments,
freeway ramps, and transit facilities. Therefore, no mitigation measures are required for these facilities and
services. However, the following mitigation measures were developed to reduce the project pedestrian and
bicycle impacts to a less-than-significant level.

Pedestrian Facilities

There is a potentially significant impact on Shearwater Parkway fronting the project site, since the project is
expected to generate an increase in pedestrian activity and there are insufficient pedestrian facilities near the
project site.

For pedestrian connectivity to the adjacent land uses we recommend that sidewalks be provided on the north side
of Shearwater Parkway east of Monaco Drive from Canvasback Way and west of the westernmost school
driveway to the new neighborhood park. According to the site plan in Figure 2, the project proposes to provide
crosswalks across Shearwater Parkway at Monaco Drive and both school driveways. To reduce potential conflicts
between pedestrians and vehicles traveling on Shearwater Parkway, we recommended that a crosswalk is
provided at Monaco Drive with the option of an additional crosswalk at the easternmost school driveway. Due to
its proximity to the curve at Marine Parkway/Shearwater Parkway no crosswalks should be provided at the
westernmost school driveway.

Additionally, high visibility crosswalks should be provided at all intersections on Shearwater Parkway.. These
treatments at the intersection will serve to alert drivers of pedestrians traveling to and from the nearby elementary
school. Specific recommendations for the Monaco Drive/Shearwater Parkway and the Shearwater

                                                                                                                  34

Parkway/School Driveway intersections are discussed in more detail in the Site Access and On-Site Circulation
section below.

To encourage pedestrians to cross Shearwater Parkway at the designated crosswalks and not mid-block, the
center median on Shearwater Parkway should have thick vegetation that hinders pedestrians from crossing but is
low enough in height (i.e., less than 2.5 feet) so as not to impede sight distance. Additionally, signs should be
provided on the south side of Shearwater Parkway to direct pedestrians to the appropriate crosswalk.

These improvements would reduce the impact to a less-than-significant level.

Bicycle Facilities

The mitigation measures presented under Pedestrian Impacts would also mitigate the potential bicycle impacts to
less than significant levels, since they would provide for adequate bicycle access to and from the project site.

SITE ACCESS AND ON-SITE CIRCULATION
Figure 2 presents the preliminary site plan for the proposed project. As indicated at the beginning of this chapter,
site access to the Preserve development site would be provided via three driveways; one for the townhouse
development, and two for the elementary school. The project proposes to align the residential driveway with the
existing Monaco Drive intersection for access to Shearwater Parkway. The Preserve driveway and Monaco Drive
approaches are assumed to be side street stop sign controlled. Under project conditions, the Monaco
Drive/Shearwater Parkway intersection with the project driveway alignment is projected to operate at LOS B
during both the morning, afternoon, and evening peak hours. Shearwater Parkway is two lanes in each direction
at Monaco Drive and given the turning movement volumes into the project site, no exclusive left-turn pocket is
necessary, though it could be provided at the City's discretion. To be consistent with other intersections in
Redwood Shores and to provide a controlled crossing location for pedestrians, the Monaco Drive/Shearwater
Parkway intersection could be all-way stop controlled. However, the intersection does not meet the MUTCD's all-
way stop warrant, and the City will make the final determination on the installation of stop signs on the Shearwater
Parkway approaches. The Monaco Drive/Shearwater Parkway intersection is projected to operate at LOS A
during both peak hours with all-way stop control.

School Access

Fehr & Peers conducted an analysis of the existing circulation patterns of the existing Sandpiper Elementary
School in June 2006 to ensure that the new school does not overly burden the adjacent roadways with excess
traffic congestion during peak school drop-off and pick-up periods. Fehr & Peers summarized their findings and
recommendations for Preserve Elementary School in a memorandum to the project applicant (Appendix E).
Several key recommendations from that memo were incorporated into the proposed project site plan.

The project proposes to provide an extensive pick-up and drop-off area separate from Shearwater Parkway and
school parking facilities to accommodate traffic flow and to encourage parents to enter and leave the site without
parking. The proposed loading area is approximately 350 feet long with a storage capacity of approximately 14
vehicles and runs parallel to Shearwater Parkway in front of the elementary school. The pick-up and drop-off area
functions as a one-way street with the entrance provided at the eastern driveway and an exit provided at the
western driveway. It is possible that school representatives will have to monitor traffic in this area to ensure
maximum efficiency (e.g., that vehicles pull forward to the west end of the curb) and to discourage drivers from
parking their vehicles. This effort must include a strong education component for all new parents/guardians.

The entrance and exit driveways serving the loading area will be side-street stop controlled. To discourage
pedestrians and bicyclists from crossing the drop-off and pick-up area access points, we recommend that no
crosswalks be provided across the driveways. Additionally, we recommend that no sidewalk be provided along

                                                                                                                 35
 Draft Preserve at Redwood Shores TIA

Shearwater Parkway in front of the loading area to: 1) minimize conflict points between pedestrians and vehicles,
and 2) reduce the likelihood of drop-off activities on Shearwater Parkway by drivers avoiding queues in the on-site
loading area. The two options recommended for site access and on-site circulation elements for the Preserve
development are presented in Figure 11. Based on the current site plan in Figure 2, the project is considering a
sidewalk between the two school driveways. If a sidewalk is provided at this location, we recommend that the
sidewalk be physically separated from the roadway and separated by low-level landscaping to discourage use of
Shearwater Parkway as a passenger loading zone.

The school's exit driveway should have both an exclusive right-turn and left-turn lane out. The proposed western
school driveway is located approximately 250 feet east of the curve at the existing bridge. To facilitate movement
out of the driveway and enhance school traffic flow, a 100-foot refuge area should be provided for left-turn
vehicles exiting the school site. A minimum sight distance of 220 feet should be provided for left-turn vehicles
exiting the project site to see oncoming southbound traffic on Shearwater Parkway. The estimated maximum
queue into the school driveway is six (6) vehicles. Therefore, we recommend that a 175-foot left turn pocket into
the school driveway be provided for vehicles traveling eastbound on Shearwater Parkway.

Shearwater Parkway and Monaco Drive Intersection

The Shearwater Parkway/Monaco Drive intersection will serve as the primary pedestrian crossing to the
elementary school and residential development. Pedestrians and bicyclists will be able to use the existing multi-
use path on the south side of Shearwater Parkway to access to the Monaco Drive intersection. Assuming that the
Shearwater Parkway/Monaco Drive intersection is side-street stop controlled, we recommend that the intersection
be textured and include colored paving. This will serve as a visual cue for drivers to slow down and will increase
driver awareness of pedestrians crossing Shearwater Parkway. Though beneficial, these treatments are not
necessary if the intersection is all-way stop controlled.

An alternative (Option 2) is to have the intersection at Shearwater Parkway and the school entry driveway (i.e.,
the easternmost driveway) serve as an alternate pedestrian crossing point to the elementary school and
residential development. Some students from the Monaco Drive neighborhood may access the existing multi-use
path on Shearwater Parkway from the west and walking to Monaco Drive represents a circuitous route. Similar to
the Monaco Drive/Shearwater Parkway option discussed above, we recommend that the intersection be textured
and colored to increase driver awareness of potential pedestrians crossing Shearwater Parkway. Since the
driveway intersection with Shearwater Parkway is a non-standard intersection, we recommend additional traffic
control devices to alert drivers of pedestrians in the crosswalk. These features could include, but are not limited to
a raised crosswalk, in pavement lighting, signage, and/or flashing beacons. The disadvantage of this option is that
it more directly conflicts with inbound school traffic. However, this option provides a more direct access point to
the school, and therefore would potentially minimize mid-block crossings on Shearwater Parkway. With this option
crosswalks should still be provided across the northern, southern, and eastern legs of the Monaco
Drive/Shearwater Parkway intersection.

The distance between the Monaco Drive intersection and the school entrance is approximately 150 feet and could
result in potential conflicts between vehicles continuing westbound on Shearwater Parkway and those accessing
and exiting the new Preserve residential development school parking and passenger loading area. Therefore, we
recommend that the outside through lane be striped as a right-turn lane approximately 200 feet east of Monaco
Drive. This will indicate to drivers that want to continue west on Shearwater Parkway to move to the left lane and
prioritize the right lane for turning movements at residential and school driveways. This lane configuration will also
allow for some storage capacity should vehicles temporarily queue out of the school driveway onto Shearwater
Parkway. As currently exists, Shearwater Parkway will continue after the school driveway as a one lane road in
the westbound direction until it widens at Marine Parkway after crossing the existing bridge.




                                                                                                                   36

Parking

Using the observed parking demand at Sandpiper Elementary School as a guideline and attempting to minimize
the supply, the parking lot at the Preserve elementary school should initially include 70 spaces. The 70 parking
spaces should be able to serve the need of the elementary school. However, the parking demand for schools vary
by location and therefore, an additional landscaped area with space to accommodate up to 14 additional vehicles
should be maintained between the loading area and Shearwater Parkway as indicated in Figure 11. Excessive
additional parking beyond this base demand would only encourage parents to park rather than using the pick-up
and drop-off facilities. The most effective way to facilitate traffic flow and minimize congestion is to encourage the
use of the pick-up and drop-off facilities and to discourage on-site parking.

To provide for overflow parking for special events at the school facility, the project proposes to expand the
existing public parking lot at the junction of Shearwater Parkway and Marine Parkway. This lot will provide parking
for the new neighborhood park, as well as serve event and overflow parking for the school.

One concern is that parking overflow from the elementary school will encroach into the adjacent neighborhood
served by Monaco Drive. While vehicles are not expected to need to park in the adjacent neighborhoods, the
initial approach for the new school should be a thorough education campaign directed at students and parents
coupled with strict enforcement of parking violations by the appropriate law enforcement or security company
officials.

Indian Creek Access

The Indian Creek development is proposed to have access to the site via the existing driveway at Salt Court,
which is a four-way stop controlled intersection. This alignment would avoid an additional intersection on Marine
Parkway. One driveway is considered adequate to serve project-generated traffic.




                                                                                                                   37

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
At this time, Belmont-Redwood Shores School District staff have not determined how they will divide the
Redwood Shore's K-5 student population between the existing Sandpiper and the proposed Preserve elementary
schools. The school district has considered drawing the district line based on the location of the school and
neighborhoods, or dividing the two schools by grade levels. For the purpose of this analysis, we assumed that the
Preserve School will primarily serve the northeastern population, while Sandpiper School will serve the
southeastern student population of Redwood Shores. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine if the
intersection impacts would be different if the school boundaries were drawn differently. School traffic is the
highest in the morning and afternoon peak hours; therefore the PM peak hour was included in the sensitivity
analysis. Table 13 summarizes the intersection LOS for the three different school district assumptions:

     1. Assumption 1 (Proposed Districting): Preserve Elementary School serves northwestern student
        population, Sandpiper Elementary School serves southeastern student population in Redwood Shores

     2. Assumption 2: Preserve Elementary School serves northeastern student population, Sandpiper
        Elementary School serves southwestern student population in Redwood Shores

     3. Assumption 3: Both the Preserve and Sandpiper Elementary Schools serve equal portions of all
        neighborhoods in Redwood Shores.

With Assumption 1 and 2, project traffic would be concentrated in the northern and southern parts of Redwood
Shores respectively. Therefore, the intersection delays are the greatest in those areas. All intersections under
Assumptions 1 and 2 are estimated to operate at acceptable LOS, with the exception of the Redwood Shores
Parkway/Bridge Parkway intersection. However, project traffic would have a less-than-significant impact since the
delay does not increase by more than five seconds.

Under Assumption 3, project traffic is distributed more evenly throughout Redwood Shores and therefore results
in the lowest overall delay at the study intersections. Similar to Assumptions 1 and 2, all study intersections are
estimated to operate at acceptable LOS, with the exception of the Redwood Shores Parkway/Bridge Parkway
intersection. However, the impact under this districting assumption are less-than-significant since the delay does
not increase by more than five seconds.

With the exception of the Shearwater Parkway/Canvasback Way intersection, all three Assumptions result in the
same intersection LOS. At Shearwater Parkway and Canvasback Way, Assumptions 2 and 3 result in LOS C as
compared to LOS B for the proposed districting, since under these two assumptions more project traffic is
projected to travel on Shearwater Parkway as compared to the proposed elementary school trip assignment.

In summary, the sensitivity analysis indicates that there will be a less-than-significant impact at the study
intersections if the school district decides to draw the district lines differently than those assumed in this TIA.

ALTERNATIVES DISCUSSION
Several alternatives were considered in the development of the current Preserve Precise Plan. The three
alternatives are:
     1. General Plan Buildout. General Plan buildout conditions as presented in the current Redwood City
        General Plan include the development of 448 townhomes, 43 single family detached dwelling units,
        154,000 square feet of commercial retail and 130 Marina slips. General Plan Buildout would develop the
        largest amount of land available on the project site as compare to the proposed project and the other
        alternatives.
     2. Alternative A. 110 townhomes and a 450-student elementary school at the Preserve, plus 60 apartment
        units at Indian Creek. This alternative is very similar to the proposed Preserve Precise Plan, though it
        does not have a 2.5 acre lagoon that separates the existing development to the east from the Preserve.
     3. Alternative B. 131 townhomes and 450 student elementary school at the Preserve, plus 27 townhome
        units at Indian Creek. In Alternative B, which is also similar to the proposed project, the outer levee
        around the project site is removed.
     4. Alternative C. 229 townhomes at the Preserve and 27 townhome units at Indian Creek. Alternative C
        includes are the aspects of the proposed project except that the school is deleted and repleaced by
        additional housing at the same density as the townhomes in the proposed project.

Alternative A and B are very similar in size and scope to the proposed project, and Alternative C presents the
highest number of residential units. The General Plan Buildout alternative is significant larger than any of the
alternatives presented. General Plan Buildout entails the development of the entire 114 acre project site.
Alternatives A ,B, and would develop between 16 and 19 acres of the project site.

The amount of traffic generated by the three alternatives was estimated by applying the daily trip rates, morning
peak hour percentages, and inbound/outbound splits for the appropriate rate published in Trip Generation, (7th
Edition, Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)). Afternoon trip generation rates were either developed based
on surveys conducted at similar developments in the Bay Area (Fehr & Peers, November 2006) and other reports,
and/or, comparison to ITE and San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) trip generation estimates.

As with the proposed project, the amount of traffic generated by the elementary school in Alternatives A and B
was developed based on field observations at the existing Sand Piper Elementary School in Redwood Shores.

Table 14 summarizes the trip generation estimates for the three alternatives and compares it to the proposed
Project.

The General Plan Buildout alternative is estimated to generate a slightly lower morning peak hour traffic as
compared to the proposed project and Alternative A and B. However, it is estimated that this alternative will
generate the highest amount of afternoon peak hour trips and substantially more PM peak hour trips. Plus, the
trips generated by these alternatives will extend across a greater area as compared to the proposed project and
Alternatives A and B, since the school trips are more locally based. The Preserve Elementary School eliminates
the need for additional vehicles trips for K-5 students to travel to alternate schools outside of Redwood Shores,
and therefore, potentially reduces vehicle trips at the more congested intersections near U.S. 101.

It is estimated that the operations of the study intersections east of Bridge Parkway will operate at acceptable
LOS under General Plan Conditions. However, additional analysis is necessary to determine whether the General
Plan alternative would significantly affect operations at the intersections close to U.S. 101. Overall, General Plan
Buildout would have the greatest transportation impact, as compared to the proposed project and the three
alternatives.

                                                                                                                 41

 Daily and AM townhouse trip generation estimates based on rates and equations presented in ITE Trip Generation, 7th Edition (Institute of Transportation Engineers
 (ITE), 2003). Afternoon trip generation from trip generation surveys conducted at similar development by Fehr & Peers (November 2006) and/or comparison to ITE
 and SANDAG trip generation estimates and other reports.

 Elementary school trip generation from trip generation surveys conducted by Fehr & Peers at Sandpiper Elementary, Redwood Shores, CA (June 2006)


Since Alternatives A and B are very similar in scope and size to the proposed project, they are estimated to
produce only slightly higher project trips as compared to the proposed project. As compared to the proposed
project, the addition of project traffic from Alternatives A and B are minimal and are not estimated to result in any
significant change in delay at the study intersections.

Since Alternative C does not include a 450-student elementary school, the morning and afternoon trip generation
estimates are lower as compared to the proposed project and Alternative A and B. However, Alternative C is
estimated to generate more evening peak hour trips. Similar to the General Plan alternative, the trips generated
by Alternative C will extend across a greater area as compared to the proposed project and Alternatives A and B,
since many of the school trips are more locally-based.

In summary, based on the trip generation estimates presented in Table 14, Alternative C would generate the
lowest number of project trips since it does not include the 450-student elementary school. The proposed project
and the similar Alternatives A and B are estimated to generate similar number of vehicle trips and compared to
the General Plan alternative will generate less trips. Alternatives A, B, and C are estimated to have the least
impact on the transportation system.

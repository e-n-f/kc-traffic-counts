GATEWAY SOUTH SITE, SCOTTS VALLEY
Scope of Services  Wetland Delineation

This proposal provides a description of the tasks required to update the wetland delineation of the
Gateway South parcel proposed for development of a large retail store. This scope does not
include obtaining the necessary regulatory permits for those portions of the project site that will
affect federal or state jurisdictional wetlands through discharge of fill material or other substantial
alteration of their condition. It is assumed that permitting would be undertaken by other parties on
behalf of the project applicant, once the project reaches that stage.

Project Understanding
The proposed project would involve construction of a 155,000-square-foort store, currently
planned for occupancy by Target Stores, on La Madrona Road Drive south of Mount Hermon
Road in Scotts Valley. Small areas of wetlands were identified on the project site during earlier
site investigations. Federal and state laws and policies regulate the discharge of fill material into
wetlands, and in some cases also may regulate activities that occur near such so-called
"jurisdictional areas" (i.e., areas under the jurisdiction of applicable federal and state regulatory
agencies) that can be shown to have substantial effects on their ability to perform certain
important ecological functions.

ESA has reviewed the previous wetland delineation, included as an appendix in the SEIR
prepared for the same site in 2005. The appendix is not very detailed with respect to the size,
extent and characteristics of the wetlands, but several points are relevant:

    1. The wetland delineation is out of date. Wetland delineations, if verified (i.e. confirmed by
       as to the location and size) typically expire five years after approval by the U.S. Army
       Corps of Engineers (the Corps), which is principally responsible for regulating federal
       wetlands. The previous wetland delineation was completed in 2004; nonetheless, the
       delineation was never submitted to the Corps for verification. Therefore, for this reason
       alone, the delineation needs to be re-done.

    2. In the years since the previous delineation was completed, there have been substantive
       changes to how the Corps delineates, verifies and permits projects with wetlands fills. A
       new delineation will need to take these changes into account to avoid being returned for
       not providing adequate information upon which to make a jurisdictional determination.

    3. Wetlands on the project site may be isolated, which means they do not have a surface
       hydrological connection to traditional navigable waters, such as creeks, rivers, or



                                                  1
ESA 207755                                                                                  May 7, 2008
         Monterey Bay. Therefore, such wetlands as existing on the project site may not be Waters
         of the United States and, as such, would not be subject to Corps jurisdiction. However,
         wetlands may still be considered Waters of the State, and subject to a different set of state
         regulations with similar documentation, protection and mitigation requirements.

Project Approach
The basic sequence of services proposed are: delineation, followed by Corps verification (if
necessary). The delineation is the process of determining the location and extent of jurisdictional
waters, including streams, seeps, springs, marshes, etc. Once the wetland features have been
identified, a report is submitted to the Corps (if there are potential waters of the U.S.) and the
Regional Water Quality Control Board.

Delineation of Waters of the U.S. and of the State, including
Wetlands
ESA will conduct a routine wetland delineation of jurisdictional waters of the U.S., including
wetlands, on the entire 19-acre parcel. The previous wetland delineation will be used as a guide
for locating the freshwater seeps that were previously identified, but conditions may have
changed in the intervening years. ESA will prepare a Draft Delineation Report, including a map
of the jurisdictional areas, for review by the City. The final Delineation Report will be submitted
to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers only in the event that the wetlands are determined to meet
the criteria for federal jurisdiction, which is essentially a clear connection to surface waters, either
on the property or off it.

If it is necessary to submit the Delineation Report to the Corps, then a site visit by Corps staff will
typically take place. ESA will accompany Corps staff to review the site conditions and methods
of delineation. The Corps may make requests to change certain details of the report or map. ESA
will make those changes, then re-submit the revised Delineation Report. The Corps will then send
a letter confirming the extent of its jurisdiction. This jurisdictional determination will be valid for
five years.

Wetlands that are not federally jurisdictional may still be considered Waters of the State, subject
to regulation by the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB). The
Regional Boards do not have the same separate and formal process for reviewing wetland
delineations as the Corps. Therefore, the delineation can be submitted with the permit
applications once the project proceeds to that stage. However, this scope includes consultation
with RWQCB staff and

ESA will submit one copy of draft reports to the project applicant for review; we assume that the
draft will not receive more than one round of review, and that one set of consolidated, non-
contradictory comments prior to submitting to ESA. ESA will prepare a total of 10 copies of final
reports for Agency staff, the applicant, and ESA. Copies will also be available in PDF format.

Data Needs
To prepare the Wetland Delineation Report, ESA will require the following information. (It is
assumed that the City will obtain these data from the applicant, property owner, or other parties
and provide the information to ESA.)

            Color aerial imagery, ortho-rectified to national mapping standards, optimally at a
             resolution of one foot per pixel or finer.

            Contour data flown for design purposes also will assist to accurately map jurisdictional
             features.

If the above data are not available, ESA will acquire imagery at additional cost.

Budget
We estimate that the work scope described herein can be completed for $6,675.

Assumptions
          There will be no significant changes (e.g., changes to the construction footprint) in the
           project design after 90%.
          There will be no more than one round of review on any document by client.
          If necessary, the project sponsor or applicant will obtain right of entry permission for ESA
           parcels not owned by the sponsor or applicant for the purpose of conducting the
           delineation.
          This scope does not include any permits for geotechnical borings in or near wetlands. If
           borings were to occur in wetlands, drainages, or riparian areas, environmental permits
           would be required. If permits are needed for borings, schedule and cost would be affected.
          The likelihood of endangered species on the site is judged to be slight. However, if the
           wetlands on the project are not federally jurisdictional, then the project will not have a
           federal nexus with regard to any endangered species issues that may be identified on the
           project site. In the absence of federal nexus, consultation with the US Fish and Wildlife
           Service (USFWS) on endangered species would need to be conducted directly with the

Scope of Work                                                                                                 May 7, 2008
       USFWS according to Section 10 of the Federal Endangered Species Act following
       submittal of application materials to the agency. This consultation process is more
       protracted than if the wetlands are federally jurisdictional, wherein the endangered species
       consultation is facilitated by the Corps as part of the wetland permitting process. ESA
       anticipates there will be no endangered species consultation, and is not included in this
       proposal. If it is required, a separate scope and budget will be provided for that task.
      Cultural resources, including archaeological and historical resources, are not anticipated to
       be of concern at the project site, and are therefore not included in this scope of work.
       Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act requires federal agencies to review
       all actions that may affect a property listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of
       Historic Places. If the Corps takes regulatory action, then it is required to comply with
       Section 106 when issuing general permits, and will typically adopt recommendations
       received through its consultation with the SHPO. If cultural resources are determined to be
       an issue, then ESA will prepare a separate scope and budget to resolve any cultural
       resource issues by providing the Corps with information it requires to meet its Section 106
       obligation.
      The General Construction Permit requires the preparation and implementation of a Storm
       Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) prior to the start of construction. Typically, this
       is the responsibility of the construction contractor, so it has not been accounted for in this
       scope. ESA can assist in preparation of the SWPPP as a task with separate scope and
       budget, if needed.
      The project applicant must obtain all applicable wetland permits prior to initiating ground-
       breaking, construction, or any type of site modification. The wetland delineation report and
       verification of the delineation by the Corps do not represent permits.

Rare Plant Survey Report
Summary
This report presents the findings of two focused floristic surveys conducted at the proposed
Gateway South Retail Store site located in the City of Scotts Valley, on May 8, and June 20,
2008. The purpose of these surveys was to document the diversity of plant species occurring on
the property in a comprehensive manner, and to establish whether or not any special status plant
species were growing on the property at that time.

During these surveys, no individuals or populations of special status plants were observed on the
site in 2008 (the term "special status" is described in the section Special Status Plants below). In
most respects, 2008 is considered a "normal" year for weather patterns and precipitation, apart
from the lack of late spring rain. The lack of late spring rain, and high temperatures in late spring
caused the spring and summer growing seasons to be somewhat shorter than average. However,
based on the extreme variability of weather from year to year in California, the weather in 2008
was not considered extraordinarily different from the average. Due to the early arrival of summer,
the second plant survey was conducted in mid-June instead of July or August as it might have
been in a year with a longer spring and later summer.

Project Setting and Description
The City of Scotts Valley is proposing to develop an approximately 19 acre parcel of land located
just west of State Route (SR) 17, on La Madrona Drive, generally southwest of the Mt. Hermon
Road / La Madrona Drive exit. The topography of the property slopes gently upwards in a
westward direction for the majority of the property, then reaches a much steeper slope (40 percent
and greater) on the west end of the property. The development plans are restricted to the areas of
gentler slopes, approximately 7 acres, so a large portion of the property will remain unaltered.
The proposed development is a retail store, which will cover 155,000-square feet, with additional
area used to construct a parking lot, retaining walls against the steep slopes, and landscaping
around the development.

Land management of the site appears to have been minimal, at least during the past several years.
The concrete foundation and rubble piles at the site indicate that a structure was once present, but
there are not currently any structures on the property. The grassland area is occasionally disked or
mowed by the City of Scotts Valley for fire prevention management in the late spring or early
summer. No mowing or disking had been done in 2008 prior to the floristic surveys. At the time
of the June 20, 2008 survey there were scattered areas of recent disturbance at the site due to
geotechnical boring, presumably in association with the proposed project. A pit was being dug at
the time of the survey on the western edge of the grassland area.

Rare Plant Survey Report




Vegetation Communities
Six distinct Vegetation communities were identified at the project site. These communities are
described below, and are also shown on the map in Figure 1.

California annual grassland is a plant community that exhibits extreme variation across the
state, but that is characterized by a dominance of native and non-native annual grasses. There can
be also be a high cover of native and non-native broad-leaved plants (forbs), and scattered, sparse
shrub and tree cover within annual grasslands. At the project site, the annual grassland is
dominated by non-native species such as soft brome (Bromus hordeaceus), sheep sorrel (Rumex
acetosella), Italian rye grass (Lolium multiflorum) and various species of vetch (Vicia spp.- some
native). The majority of the project site is dominated by this vegetation community, which occurs
mostly on the gentle to moderate east-facing slope. There is significant diversity even within the
site with regard to species diversity, distribution, and relative and absolute cover within the
California annual grassland.

California oatgrass grassland is found in small patches in or near the wetland seeps on the
property. California oatgrass (Danthonia californica), a perennial bunchgrass, is the dominant
species in this community, and forms an almost continuous cover, with few other species present
in the stand. Species that commonly associate with California oatgrass grassland are; blue eyed
grass (Sisyrinchium bellum), and blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus). This community is found in
coastal areas as well as inland grasslands throughout the state, and is an important component of
coastal prairie.

California needlegrass grassland is dominated by purple needlegrass (Nassella pulchra), which
is a perennial bunchgrass that has a large range, extending from northern California down through
Baja California and from the California coast to the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada range.
This grass forms sparse to dense stands that typically contain a wide variety of associated species,
mostly exotic annual grasses such as; soft brome, Italian rye grass, and ripgut brome (Bromus
diandrus). At the project site needlegrass grassland is found scattered within the annual grassland
in small, discrete stands, mostly on the upper slope of the grassland, but below the mixed conifer
stand tree line.

Wetland seeps are not a vegetation community per se, but rather a hydrologic feature resulting
from water seeping to the soil surface from a groundwater source. They are described here
because on the project site they support a distinct suite of plant species and constitute a habitat
type separate from their surroundings. Seeps are found dispersed throughout the grasslands at the
project site, some very small, others large. They typically support wetland species such as;
brown-headed rush (Juncus phaeocephalus), various sedges (Carex spp.), and common velvet
grass (Holcus lanatus).

Mixed conifer forest is found in the eastern portion of the property, on slopes generally 40
percent or steeper. At the project site, this community is dominated by coast redwood (Sequoia
sempervirens), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), with
scattered, mature, coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) at the lower margins of the stand. The
understory of this community is dominated by poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), and
miner's lettuce (Claytonia perfoliata). For the most part, the mixed conifer stand will remain
undisturbed by the development on the site. The exception is a grove of coast redwoods near the
north boundary of the property, which will be wholly or partially removed.

Ruderal/Disturbed is found on and around the concrete foundation and rubble piles on the site,
and in isolated patches near the road. The vegetation is composed mostly of thistles such as
Italian thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus), bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), and acacia trees (Acacia
dealbata). These areas have already been heavily modified by people, allowing non-native,
invasive plants to establish.

Survey Methods
Relevent background information for the floristic surveys was extracted from the following
sources prior to planning field visits:

        Historic and current occurrence records found in the California Natural Diversity Database
         (CNDDB, 2008), for the following USGS quadrangles; Felton, Laurel, Soquel, Watsonville
         West, Castle Rock Ridge, Big Basin, Los Gatos, and Santa Cruz.

        The plant specimen record (Consortium of California Herbaria
         (ucjeps.berkeley.edu/consortium/)).

        The California Native Plant Society Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants (CNPS,
         2008).

        Reports of special status plant surveys conducted at the site by EIP in 2002 (Biological
         Technical Report, Gateway South office Building and Fire Station,EIP, 2002), and Harvey
         and Stanley Associates, Inc., in 1988 (Gateway South Assessment District EIR Biotic
         Resources, Harvey and Stanley Associates, Inc., 1988)

        Two EIR documents discussing biological resources at the project site; Gateway South
         Specific Plan Final EIR, Zander Associates, July 1995, and the Supplemental EIR Gateway
         South Office Building and Fire Station, EIP Associates, 2005.

Based on the information gathered from these sources, the special status plant species listed in the
following section were determined to have a low to moderate potential to occur at the site. The
survey was therefore timed to coincide with the identification period of the target plant species.

The property was surveyed on foot by ESA botanists Rachel Brush and LeChi Huynh, according
to the CNPS rare plant survey guidelines1. All plants and trees were identified to the lowest

taxonomic level possible. The botanists walked transects approximately 20 ft. apart, back and
forth across the property. A comprehensive species list follows the text of this document, and
includes the plants observed both during the spring and summer surveys (May 8, and June 20,
2008). Many specimens were collected for identification purposes and subsequently pressed,
including several species of vetch, and coastal tarweed (Deinandra corymbosa). These specimens
are currently available for viewing (contact ESA at 510.839.5066), and may be donated to an
herbarium collection in the future if they are considered to be of high quality.

Special Status Plants
The term "special-status species" as used here is defined to include the following:

        Plants that are legally protected or proposed for protection under the California Endangered
         Species Act (CESA) or Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA);

        Plants defined as endangered or rare under the California Environmental Quality Act
         (CEQA), Section 15380(b);

        Plants designated as species of special concern by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or
         California Department of Fish and Game;

        Plants listed in the California Native Plant Society's Electronic Inventory of Rare and
         Endangered Vascular Plants of California (CNPS, 2008).

Based on a review of the relevant background information sources listed above, it was determined
that the species listed in Table 1 may have a low to moderate potential to occur at the site.
However, since all plants encountered during the surveys were identified to the species level or
lower, any rare plants growing at the site at the time of the surveys would have been found,
regardless of whether or not they were on the target list prior to embarking on the surveys.

Conclusions
Based on the focused floristic surveys conducted on May 8, and June 20, 2008, no special status
plants (as defined above) were observed at the project site. This survey, in combination with
CNDDB records, Herbarium records (those presented by the Consortium of California Herbaria
ucjeps.berkeley.edu/consortium), and previous survey reports (EIP, 2002, and Harvey and
Stanley Associates, Inc., 1988), further confirms that special status plants have not been
documented at this site.

             Dear Karl:

                     At your request I visited the proposed Target project site in Scotts Valley, CA to see if
             habitat conditions have changed since the time of my 2002 assessment report on four rare or
             endangered insect species that occur at other locations in the greater Scotts Valley area. I refer
             you to my 2002 habitat assessment report for details on the biology, habitat requirements, and
             geographic distribution of the four insects. When I conducted my 2002 habitat assessment
             survey, the proposed project included an office building and fire station.

                     I revisited the project site May 9,2008. I hiked throughout the property and examined
             the soils and habitats present there. Soils and habitat types at the property are still not suitable to
             support the Opler's Longhorn moth, Ohlone Tiger beetle, Mt. Hermon June beetle, or Zayante
             Band Wing grasshopper. Due to the absence of habitats suitable to support any of the four
             special-status insects, construction and operation of the proposed Target store should not impact
             any of these insects or their habitats.

                    11'you have any questions regarding my originai habitat assessment or 2008 visat, just
             contact me.

                                                                                             Sincerely,

GATEWAY SOUTH RETAIL STORE
Arborist Report

Introduction
Environmental Science Associates (ESA) was contracted by the City of Scotts Valley to perform
a tree survey and produce an arborist report for the Gateway South Retail Store Plan Area (herein
referred to as the proposed project). The project would develop a retail store, associated parking
and driveways, landscaped area, and open space.

The 17.62-acre site is located within the City of Scotts Valley, in Santa Cruz County (Figure 1).
Trees within the proposed project area are therefore subject to the City of Scotts Valley's tree
protection regulations. The site is on La Madrona Drive, west of State Route (SR) 17, and
generally southwest of the Mt. Hermon Road / La Madrona Drive exit. The site is bounded on the
east by La Madrona Drive, on the north by the Hilton Hotel, on the west by the Monte Fiore
community residential uses and to the south by Silverwood Drive and undeveloped land outside
the city limits, within County jurisdiction.

The purpose of this report is to document tree resources in the project area that may be adversely
impacted by implementation of the proposed project, to document the potential effects of the
proposed project on tree resources, and to identify recommendations for avoidance, minimization,
and mitigation of the potential effects on trees.


Regulatory Setting
City of Scotts Valley
City of Scotts Valley General Plan
According to the Tree Protection Regulations, Section 17.44.080 of the Scotts Valley Municipal
Code, protected trees within the City of Scotts Valley's jurisdiction are defined as:

           Any standing or upright tree meeting any one of the following criteria:

                         Any tree having a main stem or trunk at least 8 inches or greater diameter at
                         breast height (DBH)1 (25 inches in circumference), located in a hillside
                         residential zone where the slope within 20 feet of where the tree is located
                         exceeds 20 percent;



1   DBH, or diameter at breast height, is measured at 4 feet from the ground.

                         size, as among the most significant and noteworthy in the city and formally
                         designated by the City Council.

No tree removal permit is required to remove fruit trees, Monterey Pine trees that are infected
with pitch canker, blue gum eucalyptus, or acacia trees. Additionally, no permits are required to
remove bay laurel trees if they are growing under the drip-line of an established oak tree.

The City of Scotts Valley encourages preservation of trees to the greatest extent possible.
Proposals for removal of protected trees within the City require that project proponents obtain a
Tree Removal Permit (except in case of immediate hazard), which involves submitting an
application and an Arborist's Report to verify reasons for removal or to determine alternatives to
tree removal. Removal of protected trees other than Heritage Trees may be granted
administratively. Heritage Tree removal must be approved by the Planning Commission. As an
alternative to a separate Tree Removal Permit, tree removal may be permitted as part of the
authorization by the Planning Commission or City Council of a larger development application
pursuant to the City zoning ordinance. The determination as to whether a tree may be removed is
based on the condition (health) of the tree; topography, including the effect of tree removal on
erosion, soil retention, and runoff; and other nearby trees and "the effect the removal would have
upon shade, sunlight, privacy, scenic beauty, wildlife, noise, air quality, wind, health, safety,
prosperity, historic values and general welfare of the area and the city as a whole" (Municipal
Code Sec. 17.44.080(H)(2)(c). The City may require replanting of replacement tree(s) or payment

Methods
The project site was surveyed by ESA's certified arborist LeChi Huynh (International Society of
Arboriculture Certified Arborist Certification Number WE-8322A) on May 8, 2008. The survey
consisted of identifying, measuring, and assessing all potentially affected trees in the project area.
In addition, trees were tagged with 1" aluminum tags. Seven additional trees near the perimeter of
the proposed project footprint were surveyed on June 2, 2008, by ESA botanist Rachel Brush;
these trees were not tagged. Information collected includes diameter of the tree at breast height
(4.5 feet), radius of dripline (measured at the largest radius), the general condition of the tree and
its components (root collar, trunk, limbs, foliage), the general structural health of the tree, and its
overall vigor. The "Condition" of the tree is defined as follows:
Excellent: Tree is without any visible deficiencies. Tree is in excellent health and is structurally
           sound, with little evidence of dieback and good overall annual growth. The tree
           shows no sign of disease, decay, or mistletoe infestation. The tree has a balanced
           branching structure.
Good:             Tree has no major deficiencies but may have minor defects such as minor dieback or
                  overcrowding. Tree is in good health and is structurally sound. Minor defects are not
                  detrimental to overall health of tree.
Fair:             Tree has no major deficiencies but many minor defects. Tree is in average health and
                  may have some structural deficiencies such as decay and numerous dead limbs.
                  Overall health and integrity of the tree is not adversely affected at present, but the
                  tree may have limited growth, and unbalanced or asymmetrical form. Deficiencies
                  may be detrimental to long-term health of tree.
Poor:             Tree has major deficiencies that are detrimental to health of tree, including major
                  decay in the trunk or main limbs, extensive dieback, sparse foliage, extreme
                  overcrowding, and unbalanced or asymmetrical form.
Trees may be ascribed a condition that falls between the described major categories (i.e. "Good to
Fair"). These trees have elements of both categories.

Results
A summary of the species composition and average diameter at breast height of the surveyed
trees is provided in Table 1, below. With the exception of those trees outside the proposed
footprint of project improvements (identified by an asterisk), all trees listed in Table 1 are
assumed to require removal as part of the project, based upon the Preliminary Grading &
Drainage Plan.3 Figure 2 provides an overview of the project area and approximate locations of
surveyed trees. Trees of similar species occurring in proximity to each other were mapped with a
single waypoint. A total of 32 trees were surveyed within and adjacent to the potential impact
areas on the project site. Approximately 30 of the 32 trees are anticipated to be removed, while

two trees outside the area of proposed grading and construction (#2626 and #2627) might have to
be removed, depending on the final grading plan, and would, at the least, require protection
during grading and other activities to avoid being damaged by construction equipment.4 Of the 32
surveyed trees, 26 were native, including: 13 coast redwood trees, ten coast live oaks, two Pacific
madrone trees, and one Douglas fir. Six surveyed trees, all silver wattles, were non-native

Vegetation communities within the project area include annual grasslands, mixed forest, and
freshwater seeps. The mixed forest area is located west of the proposed project footprint and is
found on slopes greater than 40 percent. The most notable trees on the site include a small grove
of coast redwood trees on the northern end of the parcel, scattered coast live oak trees on the
southeast portion of the parcel, and non-native silver wattles along La Madrona Drive on the east
side of the parcel.

None of the surveyed trees within or adjacent to the project area is listed in the City's Heritage
Tree Inventory.




4   Others of the 32 surveyed trees that are determined not to necessitate removal during construction would require
    similar protection.

1: DBH (diameter at breast height), the diameter of a tree measured at 4.5 feet above ground level on the high side of the tree, unless otherwise noted.
2: Measured at the largest radius of the dripline of a tree.
3: General health of the tree including root collar, trunk, limbs, foliage, structure, and general vigor.

Trees marked by an asterisk (*) were not tagged in the field. These trees are located near the perimeter of the project footprint, but would likely need protection during construction work if not removed..

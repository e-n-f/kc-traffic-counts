State Route 115 (U.S. 129) at Louisville Road                                    June 22, 2007

Blount County, Tennessee



BACKGROUND

The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) has initiated this study in response to a
request from the Knoxville Regional Transportation Planning Organization and the City of Alcoa to
evaluate the intersection of State Route 115 (U.S. 129) at Louisville Road in Blount County,
Tennessee. This request was advanced due to the rapid increase of commercial and retail
development within this immediate area. In addition to increased traffic, vehicular crashes have
also increased significantly. Vicinity and location maps are provided in Figures 1 and 2 for
reference. The study area includes not only this main intersection but three other intersections
located immediately to the east and west along Louisville Road.


EXISTING CONDITIONS

The intersection of SR-115 (US 129) and Louisville Road is located in the City of Alcoa, which lies
between the City of Maryville and the City of Knoxville. The study area consists of this major
signalized intersection, two intersections immediately to the west, one of which is signalized, and
another unsignalized intersection immediately to the east.

SR-115 (US 129) is a major four-lane arterial roadway consisting of 12-ft travel lanes, with a full
12-ft outside shoulder, and having a 38-ft divided median. This roadway serves as a major
commuter route between Maryville and Knoxville. Base year (2012) average daily traffic (ADT)
along this route ranges from 44,560 to 46,460. This data is based upon 2006 cycle counts and 8-
hr turning movement counts obtained on February 20, 2007.

Louisville Road is a two-lane arterial that serves as a east/west connector for this area. This road
consists mainly of 12-ft lanes with no shoulder and is comprised of several left and right auxiliary
lanes within the intersection study area. Base year (2012) ADT for this road ranges from 23,160
to 23,590 based upon 2006 cycle counts and 8-hr turning movement counts obtained on February
20, 2007. This ADT represents data taken at the specific intersection of SR-115 and Louisville
Road.

The area south of Louisville Road has been the focus of large commercial development. Located
on the southwest quadrant of the intersection are two "big-box" stores (Wal-Mart and Lowes) and
several restaurant out-parcels. The southeast quadrant of the intersection currently has several
restaurants with two "big-box" retailers (unknown at this time) currently planned for this area and
are under construction. At the time of this report, further commercial and retail development is
planned for both the east and west quadrants, south of Louisville Road. An aerial photograph
showing this development is provided in Illustration 1.

The northwest quadrant of the intersection is predominantly residential, with a local church and
the county 911 call center located immediately on the corner. No further development is expected
or can be accommodated in this area. On the northeast corner resides a local lumber company
who is a major supplier of building materials for the surrounding area. Also located on this corner
are a few retail stores and restaurants. Future development is expected in this quadrant, but the
area is limited and no development is planned at this time.

Blount County, Tennessee



Accident Summary. From the period January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2005, TRIMS crash data
obtained from the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) indicated a total of 186
crashes were reported at the intersection of SR-115 and Louisville Road. Approximately 33
crashes were considered minor injury and only 1 severe injury accident. Of the total number of
crashes, 157 of the reported 186 were rear-end collisions. A crash rate of 3.64 was calculated for
this period. The critical rate was determined to be 1.23 and the severity index was 0.022. The
ratio of crashes/critical rate was 2.96 and the actual rate/statewide average was 4.00.

In comparison, data obtained from the City of Alcoa indicates that a majority of accidents have
occurred within the right turn lane for traffic traveling eastbound Louisville Road to southbound
SR-115 and westbound Louisville Road to northbound SR-115. A copy of this data, shown in
Figure 3, reveals 267 accidents, 37 of which were considered injury related, occurred at this
intersection from the period of January 2004 to December 2006. The figure also illustrates the
location and manner of the collisions within the intersection. A majority of the crashes occurred in
the right turn lanes from Louisville Road to SR-115.


COMMUNITY PROFILE

The City of Alcoa is a small industrial and manufacturing community located approximately 20
miles south of Knoxville, Tennessee. The City is situated along SR-115 (US 129) which is a
major route between Maryville and Knoxville and is easily accessible to Interstate 40. The name
of the city originates from the aluminum company, Alcoa, Inc., then known as the Aluminum
Company of America (ALCOA).

In 1910, Alcoa, Inc., began a long-range program to develop power along the Little Tennessee
River near present-day Calderwood. Several dams were constructed to supply huge amounts of
low-cost hydroelectric power necessary for the production of aluminum. Large land tracts north of
Maryville were purchased for the establishment of reduction plants.

The actual City of Alcoa was planned and designed by Alcoa engineers. By 1919, the city
contained houses, stores, schools, and other amenities. The early planners established water,
sewer, and electrical; created zoning for industrial, commercial, and residential usage; and
provided community facilities such as one(1) acre of land for parks and recreation for each 100
persons. The original site for the City covered five and one-half square miles and was designed
for a population in excess of 10,000. Since that time, the City has grown to a size almost 15
square miles.

Since that time, Alcoa, Inc. has downsized, but the City has been able to develop a diverse
economy consisting of a strong manufacturing base with retail and commercial services.
Continuous growth has taken place in both Alcoa and fringe areas as the entire Alcoa-Maryville
area has become a growing part of the Knoxville metropolitan area. Table 1 indicates the current
and projected growth for the City of Alcoa and surrounding communities.

PURPOSE AND NEED

The objective of this report is to analyze existing and projected conditions at the intersection of
SR-115 (US 129) and Louisville Road located in Blount County, Tennessee, to determine the
purpose and need for improvements. This study was initiated due to the rapid and large
commercial/retail development, as well as industrial development, occurring within the area which
is surrounded by existing residential neighborhoods. These entities are a contributing factor of
additional traffic to an already congested local and commuter transportation system. Also of
significant interest is the number of vehicular crashes occurring in this area.

The intersection is affected by three adjacent intersections which are also included as part of this
study. This study will review existing conditions, analyze traffic for existing and future conditions
and levels of service, prepare recommendations for improvement, and determine preliminary
costs relating to the proposed recommendations.

The primary need along SR-115 (US 129) is to provide for improved local and regional mobility
and access. Several specific needs are included in this goal.

       1. Provide an improved north/south route to serve demand for local and regional access to
          the interstate and neighboring communities.
       2. Improve safety and mobility along SR-115 (US 129).
       3. Accommodate the increased traffic demand spurred by commercial development within
          the adjacent intersection and local community.
       4. Create an opportunity for additional economic growth within the City of Alcoa and Blount
          County by providing an improved transportation system.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS

Year 2012 traffic data for the main SR-115/Louisville Road intersection indicates this intersection
and adjacent intersections have capacity deficiencies. Also, future year volumes suggest that
major relief to congestion and driver comfort can only be achieved through developing a grade-
separated interchange at this location; SR-115 being elevated over Louisville Road. However,
several issues complicate the viability this option.

    1.   Cost.
    2.   Inconvenience to the motoring public during construction.
    3.   Limited right-of-way.
    4.   No new parallel corridors or improvements to existing facilities have been considered to
         alleviate congestion along the SR-115 corridor. Local officials are currently working with
         the TPO to determine projects for the long-range plan. (Note, TDOT is currently
         developing right-of-way plans for widening Middlesettlements Road, located immediately
         south, which is scheduled due by end of year 2007. While this does not affect the SR-115
         corridor, it will have an affect upon this study area since Hunters Crossing ties into
         Middlesettlements Road.)

While a grade-separated interchange does meet the purpose and need for this project, this option
was not considered due to the aforementioned issues. Further study is suggested that will
encompass a much broader study area for the purpose of reviewing the affects of a grade-
separated interchange and its impacts along the entire SR-115 corridor.

Assessment of the study area by the design team, and input from the stakeholders field review,
determined the following options that will best meet the purpose and need goals for this project.

Option 1:           Create auxiliary lanes along SR-115 for the movements eastbound (EB)
                    Louisville Road to southbound (SB) SR-115, and westbound (WB)
                    Louisville Road to northbound (NB) SR-115. Also create a deceleration
                    lane for northbound (NB) SR-115 to eastbound (EB) Louisville Road.
Option 2:           Signalize the right-turn movements for EB Louisville Road to SB SR-115
                    and WB Louisville Road to NB SR-115.
Option 3:           Remove the left turn entry from Louisville Road onto both Hunters Crossing
                    and Brenda Drive, and define these intersections to be right-in/right-out
                    only.
Option 4:           Create a double left-turn movement for WB Louisville Road onto SB SR-
                    115.
Suggested Options:  Several options are recommended as a suggestion to improving the overall
                    operation and safety of the intersection at SR-115/Louisville Road, based
                    upon a traffic operations standpoint. Because of their significant impact to
                    the overall area and community, further study and stakeholder involvement
                    is suggested to review the affects of these suggestions and consider other
                    possible alternatives.

                            1.     Eliminate the intersection of Hunters Crossing at Louisville Road.
                            2.     Eliminate the intersection of Brenda Drive at Louisville Road.
                            3.     Eliminate the intersection of the Unnamed Business Entrance
                                   (adjacent to Cracker Barrel) at Louisville Road.

Option 1:
Existing right-turn lanes at the intersection of SR-115/Louisville Road are such that they limit free-
flow movement of traffic when exiting Louisville Road to SR-115. Currently vehicles on Louisville
Road must yield to on-coming traffic along SR-115 when making a right turn which accounts for a
large number of rear-end collisions occurring at these points. Development of an auxiliary lane
for the movements EB Louisville Road to SB SR-115 and WB Louisville Road to NB SR-115 will
likely help alleviate congestion by facilitating free-flow operations and reducing traffic queues
waiting to enter the roadway, thereby reducing and/or eliminating potential crashes. A
deceleration lane is also suggested for NB SR-115 to EB Louisville Road.

The conceptual layout illustrated in Figures 6-1 and 6-2 shows that sufficient length along SR-
115 exists for the development of a full 12-ft auxiliary lane in the suggested locations. A minimum
length of 660-feet can be obtained for the northbound and southbound acceleration lanes along
SR-115 (Exhibit 10-70, AASHTO Greenbook ­ Chapter 10). Also, a minimum length of 435-feet
can be obtained for the deceleration lane for northbound traffic along SR-115 ((Exhibit 10-73,
AASHTO Greenbook ­ Chapter 10). Addition of the recommended auxiliary lanes can be
accommodated within the existing right-of-way without the need for acquiring additional right-of-
way.

Creation of an auxiliary lane along SB SR-115 will introduce a weaving situation near the exit
ramp for the Wal-Mart shopping center and Middlesettlements Road. No traffic data was
available for this exit ramp, therefore 15% traffic was assumed. Table 4 indicates the results of
this weave analysis.

Option 2:
As an alternative to Option 1, additional consideration was given to reconstructing the eastbound
and westbound right turn lanes so that they would be controlled by the traffic signal instead of the
existing yield conditions. Under this scenario, the eastbound and westbound right turns would be
given "green" time with the eastbound and westbound through movements. Also, right turn
overlap signal phases would be provided to allow the eastbound and westbound right turns to
operate with the northbound and southbound left turns. With this configuration, it is likely that
rear-end accidents would decrease for the eastbound and westbound turning movements.
However, the projected vehicle queues for these turning movements will be excessive, creating
further congestion and delays. Specifically, based on both Year 2012 and Year 2032 traffic
volumes, these queues are expected to extend beyond the adjacent intersections. Table 5
shown in the next section, Level of Service, discusses the results of this analysis. Specifically,
Table 5a and 5b include the results of the capacity analyses conducted for the existing laneage
and traffic control. Table 5c and 5d include the results of the analyses conducted for the changes
proposed for Option 2. A conceptual layout for this option is provided in Figure 7.

Since single right-turn lanes are not feasible, the formation of double right-turns for this option
was considered. Analysis revealed this configuration also creates excessive vehicle queues,
adding further congestion and delays. Results are also provided in Table 5e and 5f.

Option 3:
Currently, vehicles can access Hunters Crossing and Brenda Drive directly via left-turn lanes off
of Louisville Road. Each of these intersections reside approximately 350-ft within the main SR-
115/Louisville Road intersection. The close proximity of these intersections combined with the
heavy traffic volumes creates added congestion, backups, and reduced driver comfort levels
within the area. This option proposes eliminating the left turns from Louisville Road. In each
case, vehicles that desire to turn left onto the side streets can utilize an adjacent signalized
intersection which will still provide easy access to these locations. Hunters Crossing and Brenda
Drive would then be striped into a right-in/right-out only situation. A conceptual layout of this
option is provided in Figure 8-1.

                                  Left-turn onto Brenda Drive to be eliminated.


Option 4:
Traffic movement from WB Louisville Road to SB SR-115 currently utilizes a single left-turn lane
at the intersection. Adequate area exists to create a double left-turn for this movement. As
discussed in Option 3, the elimination of the left-turn from Louisville Road onto Brenda Drive
would further facilitate this option and produce greater storage for this particular movement. A
conceptual striping reconfiguration is also shown in Figure 8-1.

Suggested Options:
The intersections of Hunters Crossing, Brenda Drive, and Unnamed Business Entrance (near the
Cracker Barrel restaurant) along Louisville Road impact the overall traffic operation and safety of
the main intersection SR-115 and Louisville Road. Their close proximity, approximately 350-ft.,
350-ft., and 450-ft., respectively, creates added congestion, delays, and limits vehicle storage due
to their turning movements along Louisville Road. The operation and performance of the
intersection at SR-115 and Louisville Road suggests these intersections be closed due to their
close proximity to the main intersection. Figure 9 illustrates conceptually that existing traffic could
utilize a nearby signalized intersection; Hunters Crossing rerouted to the signalized Wal-Mart
entrance, Brenda Drive and the Unnamed Business Entrance rerouted to the signalized
intersection at Marilyn Drive.

Improvements to these intersections do not fall within the scope of this report due to the local
jurisdiction surrounding this study area. It is recommended that further study be initiated between
local officials and stakeholders such as Wal-Mart, Cracker Barrel, Anderson Lumber, etc., who
will be impacted the most to discuss the affects of closure at these intersections and determine
acceptable solutions.

LEVEL OF SERVICE

Operating conditions within a transportation route are distinguished by a "Level of Service" (LOS)
analysis. This analysis reflects the ability of the roads, in this case, intersections, to
accommodate motor vehicle traffic and subsequent physical and psychological comfort levels of
drivers. A LOS analysis considers several factors including traffic volumes, number of travel
lanes, terrain, truck traffic, and turning movements. Existing and projected traffic volumes for this
study report are included in Appendix B of this report. Project volumes are for the base year
(present year + 5 years) and design year (present year + 25 years). Schematic diagrams of each
intersection are also included with their respective traffic volume.

LOS is a qualitative measure that describes the character of traffic conditions related to speed
and travel time, freedom to maneuver, congestion, etc. There are six levels of operation ranging
from "A" to "F" with "F" being the worst. A description of the operating conditions for each level is
provided in the following.


        LOS               Traffic Flow Condition

          A               Free flow operations. Vehicles are almost completely unimpeded in their
                          ability to maneuver within the traffic stream. The general level of physical
                          and psychological comfort provided to the driver is the highest.

          B               Reasonably free flow operation. The ability to maneuver within the traffic
                          stream is only slightly restricted and the general level of physical and
                          psychological comfort provided to the driver is still high.

          C               Flow speeds at or near free flow. Freedom to maneuver within the traffic
                          stream is noticeably restricted and lane changes require more vigilance on
                          the part of the driver. The drive notices an increase in tension because of
                          the additional vigilance required for safe operation.

          D               Speeds decline with increasing traffic. Freedom to maneuver within the
                          traffic stream is more noticeably limited. The driver experiences reduced
                          physical and psychological comfort levels.

          E               At lower boundary, the facility is at capacity. Operations are volatile
                          because there are no gaps in the traffic stream. There is little room to
                          maneuver. The driver experiences poor physical and psychological comfort
                          levels.

          F               Traffic flow is breakdown. The number of vehicles entering the highway
                          section exceeds the capacity or ability of the highway to accommodate the
                          number of vehicles. There is little to no room to maneuver. The driver
                          experiences poor physical and psychological comfort levels.

Blount County, Tennessee




Specifically, these analyses are based on the Year 2012 and Year 2032 projected traffic volumes
that have been developed by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT). In addition, it
is important to note that two scenarios were considered:

    Existing Laneage and Traffic Control 

    Proposed Laneage and Traffic Control 


The proposed laneage and traffic control includes the following changes to the existing system:

    State Route 115 and Louisville Road (Option 1)
    It was assumed that an acceleration lane will be constructed on northbound State Route 115
    for vehicles in the westbound right turn lane. Also, it was assumed that an acceleration lane
    will be constructed on southbound State Route 115 for vehicles in the eastbound right turn
    lane. Although these improvements will not provide additional capacity at the intersection of
    State Route 115 and Louisville Road, they are expected to reduce the vehicle crashes at this
    location.

    Addition of Signalized Right-turn for WB / EB Louisville Road at SR-115 (Option 2)
    Single and double right-turn lanes to be controlled by the signal at SR-115 were each
    considered for eastbound and westbound Louisville Road. Results for these configurations
    are shown in Table 5.


The intersection at Marilyn Drive was not part of this report's scope of work, and therefore no
traffic data was available to analyze the performance of this intersection

A copy of the capacity analysis worksheets for this study can be found in Appendix C of this
report.

Proposed Intersection Improvements                              Transportation Planning Report

State Route 115 (U.S. 129) at Louisville Road                                    June 22, 2007

Blount County, Tennessee



ASSESSMENT OF OPTIONS

The Tennessee Department of Transportation has adopted seven guiding principles against
which all transportation projects are to be evaluated. These guiding principles address concerns
for system management, mobility, economic growth, safety, community, environmental
stewardship, and fiscal responsibility. The guiding principles are discussed in the following
paragraphs as they relate to the options for improving the intersection of SR-115 at Louisville
Road.

Guiding Principle 1: Preserve and Manage the Existing Transportation System
The intersection of SR-115 and Louisville Road is at capacity based upon year 2012 and 2032
traffic. Traffic volumes will continue to increase with the continued commercial and retail
development. Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not intended to reduce traffic volumes but rather
increase safety, reduce vehicle delays, and improve operation. Implementation of Option 1 or 2,
and Option 3 and 4 will provide the greatest affect. Suggested closure of existing intersections
should consider surrounding stakeholders prior to implementation.

Guiding Principle 2: Move a Growing, Diverse, and Active Population
Commercial development along the southern portion of the SR-115/Louisville Road has increased
tremendously. Further commercial and industrial development within the area is anticipated
which will also affect existing transportation network. The options for improvements are
necessary to address an expanding market while accommodating regional commuter activity.
Suggested options should be reviewed along with discussion and input between local officials and
stakeholders.

Guiding Principle 3: Support the State's Economy
SR-115(US129) is a major corridor between Maryville and Knoxville. This highway serves as a
major commuter route as well as providing direct and indirect access for industry located within
Alcoa. The Knoxville Regional Airport is also located along SR-115, just a few miles to the north.
The cities of Alcoa and Maryville have consistently grown since 2000, and continued growth is
expected. Alcoa estimates that commercial/office and industrial businesses will account for forty
percent (40%) of usable land and residential accounting for over forty percent (40%), a combined
80%, within the City's boundaries by year 2025. The improvement of the SR-115/Louisville Road
intersection and corridor will create improved and safer access to residential, commercial, and
industrial areas in the future.

Guiding Principle 4: Maximize Safety and Security
A crash rate of 3.64 was calculated for the period January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2005, and the
statewide average rate is 0.91. The critical rate was determined to be 1.23 and the severity index
was 0.02. The ratio of actual/critical rate was 2.96 and the actual rate/statewide average was
4.00. A total of 186 crashes were reported with only one crash considered as severe injury during
this period. A majority of crashes occurred in the right turn lanes from Louisville Road to SR-115.

Guiding Principle 5: Build Partnerships for Livable Communities
Communication and involvement with stakeholders affected by the suggested closure options is
crucial to the overall community. In addition, local officials have been coordinating with Knoxville
TPO staff as well as TDOT officials to identify objectives for improving the region's transportation
system. Long term goals would not only address this particular intersection but the entire SR-115
corridor.

Blount County, Tennessee




Guiding Principle 6: Promote Stewardship of the Environment
A detailed environmental study will not be necessary to implement the improvements from
described by each option. These options do not pose a significant impact to the environment.

Guiding Principle 7: Promote Financial Responsibilities
Preliminary construction cost estimates have been prepared for the various options and are
summarized in Table 6.

                              Option 1                         $682,000

                              Option 3                          $55,000

                           Option 4                             $32,000
        *Note: A cost for Option 2 is not provided as traffic analyses indicate this option fails.



PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

Information provided by TDOT and a field level survey conducted of the project area indicates
there are no historic properties within the study area.

A review within the Area of Potential Effects (APE) displays there potentially could be some
impact due to floodplain in the immediate area. The APE is the geographic area in which an
activity may directly or indirectly impact the environment. A floodplain map, as provided by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), indicates a portion of the northeast quadrant
of the intersection at SR-115 and Louisville Road may lie within the designated zone. The limited
improvements should not have any impact or effect to the existing flood zone. A copy of the
floodplain map is provided on the following page in Figure 10.

An evaluation of existing environmental conditions was noted during the stakeholder field review
and noted in the Preliminary Environmental Evaluation checklist. A copy of the form is also
provided on the following pages.

Proposed Intersection Improvements                                Transportation Planning Report

State Route 115 (U.S. 129) at Louisville Road                                      June 22, 2007

Blount County, Tennessee



SUMMARY

SR-115 in Blount County is a four-lane arterial roadway that serves an increasingly high volume
of both commuter, local, and industrial vehicles each day. SR-115 serves as a connector not only
from Maryville to Knoxville, but provides access to Interstate 40 which is critical to industry located
in the region. The population of Alcoa and other areas within Blount County has continued to
grow, increasing between a total of 6-7% from 2000 to 2005. A large portion of Alcoa still remains
undeveloped though, with only 50% of Alcoa accounted for at the current time. As the City of
Alcoa continues to grow and expand, local development will contribute more vehicles to the local
transportation system.

The traffic analysis reveals that for the base year 2012, the intersection of SR-115 and Louisville
Road operates at LOS E during A.M. and LOS F during P.M. times. Future year 2032 analysis
indicates LOS F for both peak hour times. The high traffic volumes accounted for at this
intersection also creates a high number of crashes and the crash rate for this intersection is
above the Tennessee statewide average crash rate.

Improvements to the intersection of SR-115 and Louisville Road are necessary to achieve the
following criteria:

    · Address operational and safety concerns at this intersection and adjacent intersections
      along Louisville Road.

While relief is much needed, efforts at this time to widen the intersection or construct a grade
separated interchange would be futile since no corridor improvements are planned or identified
along SR-115. Therefore this particular improvement was not considered as an option.

Option 2 is not considered a viable option as analyses indicate this improvement fails. Therefore
this option is not recommended.

Four options were considered in addressing the purpose and need of this project. The following
is a summary of these options.

        Option 1
           · Construct acceleration lanes along SR-115 for the movements of EB Louisville
              Road to SB SR-115 and WB Louisville Road to NB SR-115.
           · Construct a deceleration lane along SR-115 for vehicle turning EB Louisville Road.
           · Estimated Cost = $682,000.

        Option 3
           · Eliminate the left-turn movement for traffic traveling WB Louisville Road to Hunters
              Crossing. Construct a raised median to prevent left turns.
           · Restripe Hunters Crossing for right-in/right-out operation.
           · Estimated Cost = $55,000.

Blount County, Tennessee




        Option 4
           · Create a double left-turn for vehicles at the intersection of SR-115/Louisville Road
              traveling WB Louisville Road to SB SR-115.
           · Eliminate the left-turn movement for traffic traveling EB Louisville Road to Brenda
              Drive.
           · Estimated Cost = $32,000.

        Suggested Option
           · Close Hunters Crossing intersection at Louisville Road.
           · Close Brenda Drive intersection at Louisville Road.
           · Close the Unnamed Business Entrance (adjacent to Cracker Barrel) at Louisville
             Road.

General Comments:

   1. Introductions to all parties attending, HMB explained and discussed the 

      background and scope of project. 

   2. HMB explained that peak volumes for base year average daily traffic (ADT) is
      approximately over 40,000, and project ADT in year 2032 is almost 55,000.
   3. Updated crash data reveals approximately 200 crashes at this intersection. Almost
      all were rear-end type crashes with very few injuries and no fatalities. It was
      asked if this project could be considered as a regional safety audit report (RSAR)
      rather than TPR due to the number of crashes and focusing just on the
      intersection. TDOT explained this project does not qualify since the high traffic
      volumes create a low crash ratio, and no serious injuries or fatalities have

       occurred. Representatives from the City of Alcoa pointed out that the majority of
       crashes occurred in the right-hand turn lane, either from EB Louisville Rd to SB
       SR-115 or NB Louisville Rd to NB SR-115.
   4. A question was asked if the project limits involved only the SR-115/Louisville
       Road intersection or if it contained any of the SR-115 corridors. HMB explained
       the projects limits included the signalized intersection near the Wal-Mart
       entrance, the intersection at Hunters Crossing (a frontage road for the Wal-Mart
       complex), the SR-115/Louisville Road intersection, and the unsignalized
       intersection for Brenda Drive/Louisville Road.
   5. The City of Alcoa had previously requested to TDOT that the SR-115 corridor as
       a whole be studied in conjunction with this intersection. This project was to focus
       only on the intersections discussed in Item #4.
   6. A TDOT representative explained TDOT currently has a SIA project on-going
       immediately south that will address improvements to Middlesettlements Road @
       SR-115.
   7. The City of Alcoa has contracted with Kimley-Horn to study the signal phasing
       along Louisville Road and also for a few signals along SR-115. Design
       recommendations for synchronizing the timing have been implemented.
       Attendees who travel the area mentioned this has helped alleviate some
       congestion.
   8. HMB explained because of the extremely large traffic volumes at the main
       intersection, a grade separation would best alleviate the congestion along SR-115.
       However, without addressing other issues along the corridor at the same time, a
       project of this magnitude would inconvenience the public without considering
       other long term corridor solutions.
   9. Limited right-of-way within the immediate area of the main intersection prohibits
       any major improvements. Retail businesses and the local 911 call center are all
       built within close proximity of the existing right-of-way.
   10. Long-range improvements along SR-115 are not identified in the long range plan
       for the Knoxville TPO at this time. The City mentioned it is working to have this
       placed in future plans.
   11. It was agreed the best options for improvement would be to address short-term
       safety and congestion. HMB discussed with TDOT and the City various
       alternatives. Two of which would be to reduce crashes occurring in the right-turn
       lanes mentioned in Item #3. Also, it was discussed to realign Hunters Crossing
       with the signalized intersection for the Wal-Mart entrance to alleviate the left turn
       movement from Louisville Road. And also address the left turn movement from
       Brenda Drive onto Louisville Road.
   12. It was mentioned that projected traffic does include traffic estimated for the
       development under construction in the southeast quadrant of the intersection.
   13. Level of Service was discussed for the intersection; currently functions at Level
       D.
   14. The City mentioned updated aerial photography may be available for the area.
       Current aerial mapping obtained from TDOT does not show recent improvements
       within the study area. HMB had previously contacted the GIS coordinator for
       Blount County and will follow up to determine if updated mapping can be
       obtained.

   15. The City provided HMB with a printout of how and where crashes occurred
       within the main intersection.
   16. The review team discussed a variety of options for improvements concerning
       Brenda Drive and the business entrance (opposite Brenda Drive) along Louisville
       Road which will be fully discussed in the TPR as a result of this field review.
   17. Observed an illegal U-turn on Louisville Road in front of Brenda Drive during
       review. Also observed several motorists ignoring pavement markings in turning
       areas.
   18. Noticed improperly placed pavement markings currently denoted for the
       Louisville Road left-turn lane for Brenda Drive. Representatives from the City
       stated they would correct as soon as possible.

Notes:
a.  Weaving segments longer than 2500 ft. are treated as isolated merge and
    diverge areas using the procedures of Chapter 25, "Ramps and Ramp
    Junctions".
b.  Capacity constrained by basic freeway capacity.
c.  Capacity occurs under constrained operating conditions.
d.  Three-lane Type A segments do not operate well at volume ratios greater
    than 0.45. Poor operations and some local queuing are expected in such
    cases.
e.  Four-lane Type A segments do not operate well at volume ratios greater
    than 0.35. Poor operations and some local queuing are expected in such
    cases.
f.  Capacity constrained by maximum allowable weaving flow rate: 2,800 pc/h
    (Type A), 4,000 (Type B), 3,500 (Type C).
g.  Five-lane Type A segments do not operate well at volume ratios greater
    than 0.20. Poor operations and some local queuing are expected in such
    cases.
h.  Type B weaving segments do not operate well at volume ratios greater
    than 0.80. Poor operations and some local queuing are expected in such
    cases.
i.  Type C weaving segments do not operate well at volume ratios greater
    than 0.50. Poor operations and some local queuing are expected in such

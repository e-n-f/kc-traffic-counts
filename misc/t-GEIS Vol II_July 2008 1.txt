Introduction
Cornell University, with the Town of Ithaca Planning Board as Lead Agency, is preparing a
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS). Its purpose is to
identify and evaluate the transportation-related impacts of hypothetical university population growth
scenarios on transportation systems and neighborhoods over the next decade. It will also identify
potential mitigation strategies for those impacts. This will result in a set of strategies intended to
improve transportation options for the entire Cornell commuting population and reduce adverse
transportation impacts on the community. The primary emphasis will be on identifying ways to
reduce the number of motor vehicle trips traveling through residential neighborhoods to and from
Cornell. It will identify ways of getting people, not vehicles, to campus, and will include
recommendations for transportation demand management, multi-modal transportation strategies
including pedestrian, bicycle, transit and parking, safety, access and circulation modifications, such as
traffic calming, zoning changes and other measures.
In April 2006, as part of the transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-
GEIS), Cornell University embarked on a travel survey of the entire campus community: faculty,
staff, undergraduates, and graduate and professional students.1 The survey served not only to
provide a baseline for current travel habits and patterns; it also attempted to gauge the community's
interests in and preferences for an array of transportation programs and options with the ultimate
goal of reducing single-occupancy vehicle trips to and from the Ithaca campus.
The summary below provides highlights of the survey data, focusing on key trends and results. It
frames the current travel situation and highlights areas which are central to the t-GEIS, and assesses
any potential mitigations that the t-GEIS may identify. The overall response rate for the survey was
quite high: in excess of 46 percent across all groups; employees had the highest response rate at over
56 percent; undergraduates were the lowest with an overall rate of about 36 percent; approximately
50 percent of all graduate and professional students responded to the survey.
Spatial Distribution of Cornell Population
Approximately one in three employee respondents report living outside Tompkins County while
more than half report living more than 5 miles from campus. Almost none of the employee
respondents live on the campus. Essentially all of the student respondents live within the county and
84 percent of graduate student respondents and 97 percent of undergraduate respondents live within
5 miles of the campus. Among graduate student respondents, some 16 percent report living on or
immediately adjacent to campus in university-affiliated housing, while nearly 60 percent of
undergraduate respondents report living there.
Typical travel times follow similar patterns as commute distance. Approximately half of employee
respondents report that it typically takes them less than 15 minutes to reach campus; the overall
average time is about 19 minutes, noticeably less than the national average of over 25 minutes.
About 57 percent of graduate student respondents typically take less than 15 minutes while 79
percent of undergraduate respondents report they can normally reach campus in that amount of
time.




1Surveys were sent to a random sample of 2,800 employees (1,400 faculty and 1,400 staff) and 1,400 of each
undergraduate class (5,600 total). In addition, surveys were sent to all 5,647 graduate and professional students.

Means of Travel
Approximately 55 percent of employee respondents regularly drive alone to campus. Another 17

driving alone to campus. Another
2.5 percent share a ride or are dropped off. Approximately 15 percent of undergraduate respondents
ride TCAT to campus and just over 5 percent rely on private shuttles to reach campus; only 1.4
percent report biking. The vast majority living off-campus ­ nearly 71 percent ­ normally walk to
campus.
Overall, about 75 percent of all respondents vehicle commute trips on a typical day are made by
employees. The bulk of these trips are several miles in length with nearly a third of all employee
respondents driving 5 or more miles each way by themselves each day on their way to and from
campus.
Frequency and Time of Travel
While 95 percent of employee respondents make at least one trip to campus during the day (with 14
percent making multiple trips) just 14 percent come to campus after 7:00 p.m. Of those who make

evening trips, most arrive between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. and leave between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00
p.m.2
The characteristics of the student respondents are noticeably different, however. While nearly all
graduate student respondents (98 percent) make at least one trip, nearly 30 percent make two or
more trips to campus on a typical day. Nearly half of all graduate student respondents (49 percent)
return to campus one or more times during the evening. The timing of their trips is much more
spread out than employee respondents, though. Only 19 percent arrive during the a.m. traffic peak
hour (7:30-8:30 a.m.). The most common hour for arrival, however, is 8:30-9:30 a.m. when 35
percent travel to campus. Similarly, only 18 percent leave during the p.m. traffic peak hour (4:15-
5:15 p.m.). The most common hour for leaving campus is between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. when 23
percent depart campus. Most who return do so between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. and leave around 10:00
or 11:00 p.m., although a substantial number stay as late as 2:00 a.m.
Undergraduate student respondents' travel patterns are relatively similar to those of graduate student
respondents: 98 percent make at least one trip during the day and 57 percent make multiple trips; 61
percent report traveling to campus at least once during the evening. Less than 6 percent arrive
during the a.m. traffic peak hour (7:30-8:30 a.m.). Nearly 2 in 5 (39 percent) arrive between 9:15-
10:15 a.m. Just over one-fourth (28 percent) leave campus during the p.m. traffic peak hour (4:15-
5:15 p.m.). The majority returns to campus around 7:00 or 8:00 p.m. and nearly 40 percent stay until
after midnight.
There are noticeable mode shifts for evening travel when people drive to campus. Over 80 percent
of employee respondents drive alone and nearly 7 percent share a ride with equal amounts (just
under 5 percent) taking the bus and walking. Approximately 3 in 5 graduate student respondents
drive alone to campus in the evenings with about 11 percent reporting that they take the bus and
over 22 percent walking to campus. Similar shifts are noticeable for the undergraduate respondents
as well, with 35 percent driving alone to campus, 7 percent sharing a ride, and only 5 percent riding
the bus; approximately half report walking to campus.


Reasons for Driving to Campus
The survey included several questions to identify current impediments to using alternative modes to
driving alone and the improvements necessary to entice respondents to use those modes. Over half
of employee respondents cite the need to run errands on the way to or from campus for why they
drive; 37 percent have to run work-related errands on or off campus; and one third want to have a
vehicle available in case of an emergency.
The most common reason cited by graduate student respondents for driving is that they "already
own a car so it makes sense to use it": nearly half feel this way. Over 40 percent report needing to
make stops to or from campus while 30 percent report needing to make "work-related" trips that
require a car and 29 percent report needing to run personal errands during the day.




2 Employees were not asked about their time of arrival for this survey. Based on the 2005 "Tompkins County/Cornell
Employee Commuter Survey," however, approximately 50 percent of employees report arriving during the morning
traffic peak hour (7:30-8:30 a.m.) while 45 percent report leaving during the afternoon traffic peak (4:15-5:15 p.m.).

The primary improvement required
to get those employee respondents who currently drive alone to switch to the bus is simply access to

the primary reasons cited for not taking the bus to work: the time it takes and the bus schedule not
meeting their needs.

are travel time and cost.
Of the few undergraduate respondents who currently drive alone to campus, access to transit is the
most important improvement to get them to take the bus, with nearly half indicating this need.
Nearly equally important, though, are increased frequency, faster routes, improved information and
a lower cost than driving and parking on campus. For all undergraduate respondents, the primary
impediment to using the bus is cost, followed by schedule and travel time.


3 Based on the geocoding, this may also indicate a need for education: some 40 percent of all employees live within
walking distance in normal conditions (¼ mile) of a bus route. Similarly, nearly 40 percent of graduate student
respondents cite the need for a stop near their home, but over 90 percent of all graduate students live within walking
distance of a route.

Carpool

impediment to carpooling to
campus. The only other reason cited          Improvements Necessary to Carpool for Employees who Drive Alone

most frequently cited improvement                                 5%


is a ride-matching service, identified                            0%

The primary impediment to graduate student respondents carpooling to campus is a lack of access.
Also important is schedule incompatibility. Undergraduate respondents cite the same difficulties.
Vanpool
Although formal vanpool programs do not currently exist at Cornell, their creation is of interest to
the university. Respondents were
asked about their potential                       Improvements Necessary to Vanpool for Employees who Drive Alone


requirements for participating in                                 30%

primary incentive cited was a ride-

and about 4 percent indicate a need for a startup subsidy.
As with employee respondents, graduate student respondents would need a ride-matching program
to consider vanpooling. Also important are reduced permit fees for the van and a startup subsidy.
For undergraduate respondents as well, a ride-matching program would be important. Nearly as
important, though, are more convenient parking, reduced permits costs and startup subsidies.

4   Again, education and information appears to be critical as all three features currently exist for employees.

most important improvement
necessary for them to bike to work.           Improvements Necessary to Bike to Campus for Employees who Drive Alone

paths to campus. Also important are pavement condition, reduced conflicts and covered bicycle

Walk
Key to increasing walk mode share is the opportunity to live closer: over 30 percent of those who
currently drive alone say they would walk if they lived closer to campus.5 Also important ­ and less
easy to change ­ is the need to carry a less heavy or cumbersome burden to campus; support

Opinions on Other Options
As part of the survey, several additions or modifications to the TDM program were posed to the
respondents. They were also queried about future directions for growth of the campus. This section
summarizes those responses.
Just over 70 percent of graduate student respondents and two-thirds of undergraduate respondents
feel that new students should be granted a free bus pass, although there is little agreement on how it
should be funded: whether from increased tuition and fees, parking prices, or general funds. The
third of the undergraduate respondents who did not think that new students should receive free
passes could be symptomatic of the bitterness that many of the upperclassmen respondents feel at
their ineligibility for the free passes (as was thoroughly expressed in the free response section of the
survey). Employee respondents feel that new students should receive a free bus pass as well, and
that its cost should be paid for by an increase in tuition/fees for all students. All groups strongly
agree that new students should only be eligible for such a pass if they do not purchase a parking
permit.
Students were asked to identify what incentives would be necessary to give up (i.e. not renew) their
parking pass. For both undergraduate and graduate student respondents the most common response
(significantly so) was a free transit pass. For graduate student respondents, better transit service is
the second most important improvement with the offer of free or reduced rate daily parking permits
also important. Undergraduate respondents identified both incentives as well, although the access to
daily permits is more important than improved transit service. Just over 10 percent of graduate
student respondents and 6 percent of undergraduate respondents who sometimes drive to campus
indicated that they would not give up their permit under any circumstances.
If parking prices were to increase significantly (to approximately $1,000), nearly one-third of
emmployee respondents who currently have a permit say they would not purchase a permit, while
just over one-fourth say they would elect to buy a cheaper permit. Among graduate student
respondents, just over half say they would continue to purchase the permit at full price while the
remainder would abandon their permit. Just over 3 in 5 undergraduate respondents would abandon
their permit if faced with such an increase.
If the parking subsidy were to change, graduate student respondents favor a decrease for
undergrads; 45 percent favor an increase in their subsidy while 37 percent say to leave it alone; they
favor no change for employees, although if there were one, they would lean toward a decrease for
faculty and an increase for staff. Undergraduate respondents, on the other hand, feel that subsidies
should generally remain unchanged, although lean toward an increase for all groups except faculty.
Over two-thirds of employee respondents feel that the undergraduate parking subsidy should
decrease. For all other groups they feel that it should remain unchanged, though were it to change, it
should decrease for graduate students and increase for staff.
Just under half of employee respondents would favor some sort of permit restrictions limiting
parkers to one parking zone (essentially eliminating cross-parking or the tiered privileges). Support
was strongest among those who do not drive alone. A majority of graduate student respondents
would support such a policy.
There is general support across all student respondents for some level of restriction on
undergraduate students' access to parking, particularly for freshman. Two-thirds of undergraduate
student respondents (including over half of the freshman) and 88 percent of graduate student
respondents feel there should be some restriction on freshman parking (requiring that they live at

least a certain distance from campus to be eligible to purchase a permit) with 40 percent and 55
percent, respectively, supporting a total ban on freshman parking. This support drops off for
increasing class year, with only 35 percent of undergraduate respondents and 73 percent of graduate
student respondents supporting restrictions on parking for seniors. Over 90 percent of faculty
respondents believe there should be some restriction for first year students and nearly 80 percent
feel there should be a restriction for seniors. Only 44 percent support a restriction for graduate and
professional students and less than 18 percent support restrictions on their own parking availability.
More graduate respondents (35 percent) support some restriction for graduate student access to
parking than do undergraduate respondents (27 percent). Similar numbers support restrictions for
employee parking (25 percent and 27 percent, respectively).
Parking Ratio and Location
Just over one-third of employee respondents feel the university provides the right amount of
parking, while just over half feel there should be some increase in parking. Nearly 30 percent of
graduate student respondents feel there is enough parking on campus, while just over half feel there
should be more parking. Approximately 20 percent of undergraduate respondents feel parking levels
are about right while some two-thirds feel there should be an increase. Of all who favored an
increase (for all groups), most favored an increase of 10-15 percent over current levels.
For all groups, about half favor the incorporation of new parking spaces in new buildings where
feasible as the preferred location for new parking. Just over 40 percent favor constructing parking
garages on existing surface spaces. As to the location of new parking, employee and graduate student
respondents have nearly identical opinions, with approximately 55 percent favoring locations evenly
distributed on the periphery of campus with shuttle service to the center of campus and
approximately 27 percent favoring spaces at the center of campus. Undergraduate respondents as
well would prefer spaces distributed around the periphery of campus (46 percent), but almost as
many would prefer new spaces at the center of campus (40 percent). Additionally just over 20
percent of all groups feel that the university should work to close all non-visitor lots in the center of
campus.
Conclusions
Several conclusions can be drawn from the survey data:
    ·    Cornell and its employees continue to be national leaders in the use of alternative modes.
         Whereas, nationally, 75 percent of workers drive alone to work, only 55 percent of Cornell
         employees do. Similarly, less than 5 percent of workers nationwide use public transportation
         compared with 14 percent of Cornell employees. The use of alternative modes is even higher
         among Cornell graduate and undergraduate students.
    ·    Employees, though, have a larger impact on the Ithaca area transportation system than do
         graduate or undergraduate students: 75 percent of all Cornell commuting vehicle trips today
         are made by employees. Their proportion of the vehicle trips increases noticeably in the peak
         hours ­ when travel on the roadway system is highest ­ as they account for over 90 percent
         of all Cornell vehicle trips in the AM peak hour and about 85 percent in the PM peak hour.
    ·    There is generally a high level of interest in and potential for increase in usage of alternative
         modes: approximately 80 percent of all employee respondents who currently drive alone say
         they would consider using the bus; about 50 percent say they would consider carpooling;
         about one-third say they would consider using a vanpool; 40 percent say they would consider
         biking; and about 50 percent say they would consider walking.

    ·    There is an array of reasons why individuals feel the need to drive or why alternative modes
         do not meet their needs. While some of these can be addressed, others are more difficult or
         impossible to change. Thus it is critical that future TDM programs be comprehensive and
         provide an array of options to employees and students.

    Public Input to the Draft t-GEIS

    The following information in Appendix B records public input provided during
    development of the draft t-GEIS. Most of the public input comments were provided during
    the t-GEIS public open houses, described below. Some comments also were posted to the t-
    GEIS website, or mailed directly to Cornell representatives or the t-GEIS consultants. While
    the goal of gathering public input (especially during the public open houses) was to gather
    information about neighborhood livability and transportation issues relative to Cornell
    commuters, all comments were recorded, even if they were not directly related to Cornell.
    Documents from all of these public forums were posted on the t-GEIS website.

    Most of the comments received during the t-GEIS public open houses are graphically
    represented according to neighborhood on the following maps. Verbatim comments from
    the open houses, comments from the Disability Advisory Council public forum, and
    comments received on the t-GEIS website follow the maps.

    Five public houses were held during development of the t-GEIS to gather information about
    livability and transportation issues in areas being examined for neighborhood livability in the
    t-GEIS. A sixth public forum was held to gather information about community-wide
    disability issues relative to transportation.

    The first open house, held in April 2006, was designed to specifically gather information
    about pedestrian and cycling issues, and to solicit ideas on how to increase bicycle and
    pedestrian commuting to Cornell. Two more open houses were held in May 2006 to gather
    more general information about neighborhood livability and transportation issues, and to
    solicit ideas about how to increase commuting to Cornell by alternative modes of
    transportation, such as transit, walking, or cycling. These two workshops presented the same
    material but were conducted in two different locations ­ Downtown Ithaca and East Hill
    Plaza ­ to increase convenience and chances for public participation. The Ithaca
    Neighborhoods Council (INC) hosted the downtown open house, and the University
    Neighborhoods Council (UNC) hosted the open house on East Hill. In September 2006 the
    City of Ithaca Disability Advisory Council hosted a public form for the t-GEIS consultants
    to gather information about disability-related transportation issues.

    Two more public open houses were held a year later in April 2007 to review public
    comments received at the 2006 public open houses, present findings of the t-GEIS Travel
    Survey, get feedback on potential transportation impacts and mitigations, and identify more
    potential strategies for increasing the use of alternative modes of transportation and reducing
    single-occupancy vehicle use. As with the May 2006 open houses, these were also hosted
    separately by the INC and UNC downtown and on East Hill for the convenience of the
    participants.

     1      No uniformity in sidewalks ­ complicated issue
     2      Sidewalks not plowed. Otherwise beautiful walk
     3      Thanks to the Town for the path from Eastern Heights to Judd Falls         Town of Ithaca           Eastern Heights
            Road
     4      Sidewalks: need more and they should be maintained by municipality

     5      Add Pedestrian / Bike entranceways to campus, especially those that        Various                      Various
            wouldn't require lots of hill climbing
     6      Separate various transportation modes; i.e. walk along Cascadilla Creek
            is pleasant/maintain in winter
     7      Rebuilding walkway on Judd Falls Road is good example ­ heavily
            utilized (walkers/joggers)
     8      Raised X-walks don't work and become a maintenance problem
     9      I support speed tables/ calming (widespread support)
    10      Precautions should be taken to maintain easy access to sidewalk
            "tripper" buttons in the winter. Now snow generally gets piled at the base
            of the poles these "tripper" buttons are mounted on and they are really
            difficult to get to.
    11      Use "grass-pave" in lieu of concrete or asphalt for sidewalks in some
            places
    12      Heed pedestrian only phrase at crossings: Route 89/ Buffalo,               City of Ithaca           Downtown Ithaca

    17      Smaller buses more often; can more easily negotiate smaller more rural

    18      More frequent buses ­ everywhere
    19      Bus service is not always reliable; It is easy to miss early bus; Hospital is
            a difficult/confusing stop
    20      No good bus stops to service this area of Stewart Avenue (adjacent to           City of Ithaca       Collegetown

          destabilize single family neighborhoods. Affordable housing provided by

    ·    Need more expansion of rural bus routes

    ·    It's nice that the t-GEIS is doing neighborhood livability analysis and taking into
         consideration that City streets are used as access routes. People often drive into the City from
         out of town, park on residential streets, then walk to take bus up to Cornell.

    ·    Take into consideration through-traffic on the campus, where Cornell is not the destination
         but people drive through campus to get to a destination on one side or the other.

    ·    Cornell is it totally inaccessible for a manual wheelchair.

    ·    What about a fleet of inexpensive electric scooters to get around campus? They are illegal on
         public streets, but may be legal on private streets at Cornell.

    ·    Another idea is to have students volunteer to drive folks home after events.

    ·    There's a need for an accessible taxi in this community.

    ·    The $6 bus fare is difficult on a fixed income.

    ·    Label busses on the side, not just the front, so it's easy to locate them when they are all lined
         up at the library.

    ·    It would be nice to have buses without steps.

    ·    Shared bike lanes are needed on major streets in the city, such as State Street. Right now
         pedestrians have to dodge bicycles on sidewalks.

    ·    There's a need for bicycle education for students. It's illegal to ride on walks if you are over
         age 12 or if it's dangerous to ride in the street. The "dangerous" to ride in the street part is a
         little ambiguous.

    ·    Construction on the Cornell campus makes it very difficult to commute to and around
         campus. When there's lots of construction even detours have construction on them. It's very
         difficult to keep up with what's going on to be able to plan routes. Better dissemination of
         information would be helpful.

    ·    Routes around construction zones are supposed to be accessible and that doesn't always
         happen.

    ·    There probably is a bus that would work for me to get around campus, but I'm not sure how
         to find out about it. It took a year to even learn how to use the bus system on campus. Tell
         people how it is accessible & how to use it.

    ·    Some bus pull-offs (on campus) do not have curb ramps.

    ·    Accessible routes should be equitable as well as accessible. Sometimes accessible
         routes/entrances are not always equal to other routes; it takes more time to find the or to use
         them.

    ·    Transportation must be clear for people with visual disabilities. Right-on-red turns for cars
         can very dangerous for pedestrians, especially those with visual disabilities. We need
         education so drivers know pedestrians have the right to walk before a car has the right to turn
         right on red.

    ·    Snow and ice removal is a huge issue, especially at bus stops. The bus can't lower its lift in
         snow banks. It's also a problem getting off the bus into a snow bank.

    ·    Blind people can't tell which busses are lined up at the library.

    ·    Maintaining independence is really important for disabled people.

    ·    Many disabled people are deterred from using buses because of difficult waiting conditions,
         such as heat, cold, cigarette smoke, standing for long periods, etc.

    ·    If I were just commuting to and from campus I might use an alternate mode of transportation,
         like the bus, but I need to get around campus so I drive, because I may be able to get to my
         destination (ie., downhill) but cannot get back (ie, uphill) in my wheelchair.

    ·    Look at the statistics of the aging population. There will be an increasing number of people
         who will have need for disability services.

    ·    Transportation services need to be affordable for people on a fixed income.

    ·    There needs to be more education on how to use the disability transportation system at
         Cornell.

    ·    It is difficult to get to events at Cornell, especially in the evening, because you often need to
         walk long distances from parking.

    ·    Lots of people in rural areas call Gadabout, not because they are disabled, but because they
         just live far out and don't have access to good transportation.

    ·    Cornell has the potential to grow so big so fast that it may outgrow its space. Can they slow
         down and let community infrastructure catch up?

    ·    Was Ithaca College potential growth considered?

    ·    City schools let out between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. and the Youth Bureau releases vans at
         2:00 p.m. to pick up students. Many disabled students can't use the public transit system to
         get to after school programs. After-school time is also a sort of "peak traffic" time in Ithaca.
         How might after-school programs be affected by an increase in Cornell traffic during this
         time period?

    ·    One of the biggest issues is students not paying attention and crossing the street against
         traffic. It's much worse on campus than downtown. Education & enforcement are really
         important.

    ·    I am a TCAT advocate. We need more rural routes.

    ·    A $45 (monthly?) bus pass for people on fixed incomes is unreasonable, but if you need to
         the ride the bus 7 days a week you need to buy a pass.

    ·    There is a big need for wheelchair-accessible taxis in this area. The Finger Lakes
         Independence Council gets calls from Cornell students looking for ways to get around.

    ·    Ride-share, vanpooling, zip cars, etc. need to be universally accessible up front. Don't just
         designate one car for the disabled.

    ·    There needs to be a well thought out travel training program for people with a wide range of
         disabilities, including developmental disabilities. There also needs to be better
         communication about how to use the system and how to make the system universally
         accessible.

    ·    I'm very thankful for Gadabout, but I live outside it's current drop-off zone, so sometimes
         have to go 1.5 miles on the shoulder of the road in my electric wheelchair from the drop-off
         point to my home. It would be nice to improve the drop-off footprint. This reinforces the need
         for better rural transit service.

    ·    There needs to be better parking on campus for accessible vans, etc.

    ·    There needs to be education and/or regulation RE speeding bikes, especially those coming
         down State Street from Cornell.

    ·    For all the grousing we do, we do have a pretty good transportation system for people with
         disabilities.

    ·    Park & Ride would help with para-transit issues a lot. Some people can't access busses from
         where they live. It's not that they can't access the busses period; it's just that they can't get to
         the bus stops from where they live. For instance, Gadabout could pick people up from home
         and bring them to a central location where they could catch the bus. A Park & Ride could act
         as a "transfer location." If this happened Gadabout could possibly afford to expand the
         corridor length by aggregating several passenger pick-ups in one trip.

    ·    There's also a need for a Park & Ride in downtown Ithaca, not just out in Lansing or further
         out.

    ·    TCAT has a good phone system for passengers to call and ask how to use the system.

    ·    TCAT also has a new booklet (TCAT Ride Guide) which is available on the buses, around
         town, at Cornell Transportation Services, etc.

    I have lived at 1603 Slaterville Rd for many years, and think you
    should include East Ithaca in the "surrounding residential
    neighborhoods" that are affected by increased traffic to Cornell.
    Please add it to 3.1.4.4. on page 5 of the draft GEIS. You should also
    include in the Intersections to be Evaluated the SR 79 (Slaterville
    Rd.) and Burns Rd intersection, which has become more and more
    dangerous as traffic from the east increases.
    I'm an avid bicycle rider and especially look forward to the
    improvement of bicycle commuting to Cornell's campus.

    Last nights meeting and your next meeting (Jan3)            is scheduled at the
    same time as a County Legislature meeting.

    This is the second example of scheduling conflict for members of the
    county legislature. The Campus Neighborhood Council meeting also meets
    on the same Tuesday evening as the Legislature.

    The County Legislature meets the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays beginning at 5:30
    PM.

    Perhaps the 2nd or 4th Tuesdays might be considered for these important
    sessions for the entire community.

    thanks,

    11 December 2005

    Dear Sir and Madam:
    I am writing to comment on the Draft Scope of the upcoming t-GEIS
    Project, dated 15 November 2005. As specified in this document, the
    purpose of this environmental impact statement is to identify, examine
    and evaluate the impact of Cornell's off-campus students, faculty and
    staff transportation patterns on the community. One of the ultimate
    purposes to be to outline ways to reduce single-occupancy vehicles
    travelling to and from Cornell's campus.

    I would like to propose the following changes to the t-GEIS Project:
    Inclusion of West Hill as a stakeholder group Inclusion of the
    following streets and intersections to be evaluated:
    Hector Street/Mecklenberg Road (Rt 79)
    Intersection of Hector Street (Rt 79) and 13A Elm Street Extension
    Cliff Street (Rt 96)

    As I mentioned in the Town of Ithaca Planning Board meeting on 6
    December 2005, I urge the Town and Cornell to include West Hill as a
    residential neighborhood impacted by Cornell traffic both at current
    levels and as Cornell expands in the future, and as such should be
    invited to participate in this study.

    West Hill is significantly affected by Cornell traffic caused by
    off-campus students, faculty and staff for the following reasons:
    As real estate prices have risen and continue to rise in Cayuga
    Heights, Belle Sherman and Fall Creek, West Hill has become one of the
    few areas convenient to campus which offers affordable homes and rental
    units for graduate students, faculty and staff.

    Linderman Creek has become a popular alternative to on-campus family
    housing for many graduate students with family. An increasing number of
    young faculty with families have purchased homes in West Hill as it
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement                 Appendix B




    offers both affordability and a suburban feel(namely yard space and
    distance between homes).
    With Cornell's expanding agricultural programs in addition to a new
    program in the science of wine making, commuter traffic through West
    Hill is increasing rapidly. West Hill is a residential area with little
    commercial zoning. Even the slightest rise in traffic volume
    significantly affects its residents who must deal with corresponding
    increases in noise, difficulty in exiting/entering driveways, and
    inability to walk safely to neighbors homes or safely cross the street.

    As identified by various city and town committees, West Hill is one of
    the few areas in Ithaca which contains undeveloped acreage. Indeed, as
    I witnessed at this last Town Planning Board meeting, 2 out of 3
    developments to be discussed are located on Mecklenburg Road. Both
    projects will create increased traffic volume on Hector Street, adding
    to the already high volume of traffic over-burdening this residential
    street.

    I would like to remind the City and Town of Ithaca as well as Cornell
    that significant portions of Hector Street and West Hill lack basic
    city services such as sidewalks, crosswalks, multi-purpose trails, bike
    lanes or even designated shoulders. As a Cornell affiliate, my family
    and many of my neighbors would embrace the opportunity to leave our
    cars at home and use other means to get to campus and town, but are
    prohibited from doing so because we cannot safely walk, ride our bikes
    or catch the bus.

    To attempt any of these, we must walk, ride or stand in the roadway, on
    busy and sometimes winding narrow streets where cars travel at an
    average of over 45 miles an hour. As an added deterrent, even if we
    could safely take TCAT, its frequency (or lack thereof during afternoon
    hours) and lack of an direct route to and from campus make utilizing
    this service prohibitive.

    The current speed and volume of cars entering Ithaca and Cornell
    through West Hill has been the topic of ongoing concern to our
    residents. Our residential neighborhoods have come to be considered by
    these commuters as a corridor to be driven through as quickly as
    possible with no regard to neighborhood speed limits, pedestrians,
    school bus stops or school zones.

    We as a community must do whatever is in our power to improve the
    safety and habitability of our neighborhood. Essential to this process
    is to not allow ourselves to be disregarded by our City and Town
    governments and Cornell University. I urge you to acknowledge Cornell's
    impact on West Hill. I sincerely hope Cornell and the Town will include
    our community in your study and allow us to participate in the t-GEIS
    Project by offering comments and possible alternatives and solutions.

    Sincerely,
    Cynthia Brock and Raymond Craib

          To:tgeis-mailbox@cornell.edu


    To whom it concerns: I read the February 7, 2006 Final Scope document and was
    concerned about the stated objective of this project from a neighborhood perspective.
    The first paragraph of the document, under the heading Introduction and Background,
    subheading Purpose of t-GEIS states that the "major objective of the t-GEIS is to
    develop ways to reduce the number of trips by motor vehicles traveling through
    residential neighborhoods to and from Cornell." I have lived for six years on East
    Buffalo Street hill, one of the major transportation corridors to Cornell from West
    Hill, South Hill and many other areas. I contend that reducing the number of vehicles,
    although a valuable goal, is the LEAST effective way to measure true impact on a
    neighborhood. I would rather have 18 Toyota Camrys drive up Buffalo Street hill than
    one city bus or campus delivery truck. Neighborhoods are affected most negatively and
    made unlivable by NOISE and UNSAFE DRIVING. If this study doesn't factor in the
    noise generated by large vehicles such as buses and make recommendations about
    mitigating speeding and bus noise, then I fear it will end up being an expensive but
    largely ineffective effort in terms of reducing the impact of traffic on neighborhoods.

    Please let me know if there is another forum in which I should air my concerns.
    Thank you,
    Betsy Magre

    From:     Nathanael Nerode <neroden@fastmail.fm>
    To:     tgeis-mailbox@cornell.edu

    Looking at the current state of things, plus the projected growth, it
    seems that the demand for the core circulation through Cornell, as
    well as for the heaviest line-haul routes (TCAT 10 and 30) has gotten
    to the point where it might support a fixed transit link more
    efficiently than buses.

    In other words, Cornell should seriously consider the cost-benefit
    analysis of a tram/trolley/streetcar. A natural "line haul" route
    would be essentially route 30; a natural "circulator" route would be
    essentially route 10 or route 81.

    It's well known that rail infrastructure gets a higher share of
    'choice' users than bus infrastructure, and that it can carry more
    passengers per vehicle, and that it attracts slightly more willingness
    to interchange than bus-to-bus interchanges.
    In addition, and more importantly, it can be routed off-road into its
    own lane where possible, allowing it to bypass congestion chokepoints
     (provided the right of way exists and the town/village/city allows it)
    and therefore run faster and more consistently. This is particularly
    significant for routes like the North Triphammer Road - Pleasant Grove
    Road route, which suffers very nasty congestion in rush hour, but
    where the right of way clearly has room for a separate single
    streetcar lane with occasional passing tracks along most of its
    distance (though probably not for a separate bus lane, since those
    have to be wider). Off-road or separate-lane routing for a streetcar
    is also extremely plausible in North Campus, West Campus, East Campus,
    and Central Campus It may prove not to be cost-effective, but it's
    definitely worth considering, and it wasn't even considered as a
    possibility, which is really an omission.

    Even if no such thing is adopted, I had a few other thoughts. Given
    the congestion on the North Triphammer - Pleasant Grove route between
    Pyramid Mall and A Lot, it is probably worth seriously considering an
    official park-and-ride lot in the Pyramid Mall grounds for Cornell
    employees living in Lansing (a substantial and still-growing
    population).

    Bus routes are currently a rats nest, which tries to hit everywhere,
    but hits most places with low (and varying) frequency, at low speed,
    and in very unmemorable patterns.

    This may be the best that can be done for outlying area commuters, but
    it doesn't seem like the best option for the central Cornell or
    downtown Ithaca routes. Almost all of them are loops which use
    different streets to go one way and the other, and often not even
    neighboring streets, but two or three blocks away; while this makes
    sense under some circumstances, it also means that the bus routes and
    schedules will never become memorable or easy to understand. Surely
    something more, well, systematic would help!

    RE: Invitation to Appoint Resource Committee Members for
         Ten-year Transportation Impact Mitigation Strategies (TIMS) and
         transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)


    Dear:

    As part of a pro-active initiative, Cornell University and the Town of Ithaca are jointly
    undertaking a transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS) which
    will result in the development of a Ten-year Transportation Impact Mitigation Strategies (TIMS).
    An increase in the population that travels to Cornell (primarily staff, faculty and graduate
    students) affects transportation in the community surrounding the campus. The t-GEIS will study
    that effect on the surrounding community, and outline ways to reduce adverse transportation
    impacts of potential Cornell growth. Potential growth will be derived from a range of
    hypothetical Cornell campus growth scenarios over the next decade.

    TIMS will not be written before the t-GEIS. Rather, TIMS will evolve in response to the data and
    the public feedback obtained from the t-GEIS process. The mitigations and alternatives sections
    of the t-GEIS, in particular, will inform and shape TIMS, which may include recommendations
    for transportation demand management improvements, multi-modal transportation strategies
    including pedestrian, bicycle, transit and parking, access and circulation modifications, and
    zoning changes.

    We recognize that to be successful in this endeavor we need to draw on local expertise. We are
    asking you to help us assemble a Resource Committee for this important transportation-focused
    project. The purpose of the Resource Committee is to provide technical assistance through the t-
    GEIS process towards the development of TIMS. To that end, the Resource Committee will be
    composed of individuals from potentially involved agencies who are able to contribute technical
    knowledge about transportation issues because of their training and position.

    Members of the Resource Committee will be expected to contribute technical input, share
    knowledge, information and resources, provide critiques to the planning team and contribute a
    range of professional opinions on transportation planning.

    Committee members should expect to review and comment on reading materials provided in
    advance of meetings, contribute to technical discussions, and occasionally provide a brief
    presentation related to their area of expertise. Regular attendance at meetings is expected.
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                             Appendix D




    Frequency of meetings is estimated to be once every six to eight weeks for the duration of the
    project, which is expected to take up to two years.

    Please provide us recommendations for Resource Committee members relevant to your
    jurisdiction using the attached draft list as a guide. Please consider appointing Committee
    members who are able to commit to attending meetings on a regular basis for the duration of the
    project. We would like to receive your recommendations no later than September 13, 2005. We
    expect the first Resource Committee meeting to occur during the last week of September, and we
    anticipate that the Committee will meet three or four times during the scoping phase of the t-
    GEIS, which should be completed by mid-December 2005. The Committee will continue to meet
    regularly during the completion of the t-GEIS.

    Thank you in advance for helping to make this transportation-focused project successful for the
    entire community.


    Sincerely,




    Cathy Valentino, Supervisor                                          Bill Wendt, Director

    1. The committee approved minutes from the 04/27/07 meeting.
    2. Committee members reported on current transportation-related projects in the county. Sean
       Murphy said that DOT officials had a very good meeting with t-GEIS representatives in early
       June to discuss potential mitigations in the t-GEIS that may involve DOT. He said there may
       be potential DOT funding for vanpool. Bill Wendt added that the regional director at DOT
       also is very interested in park-and-ride lots, and indicated that there might be potential
       funding for lots located near state routes. Nicole Tedesco noted that there is a line item in the
       TCAT budget for a comprehensive route study. David Lieb said that Ithaca Carshare, Inc. is
       very close to launch. He said the group is now negotiating with a national provider. Bill Gray
       reported that the City of Ithaca is discussing with DOT the possibility of DOT conveying
       jurisdiction over Green and Seneca Streets to the City in exchange for the City conveying
       jurisdiction over part of NYS Rt. 13 to DOT.
    3. Kathryn Wolf presented an overview of some of the potential mitigation strategies being
       developed for the t-GEIS. These included mitigation strategies related to land use and
       transportation, cycling and pedestrian network improvements, transit, Cornell's TDM
       program, park and ride, and vanpools and carsharing. She concluded that the t-GEIS analysis
       has shown that there is significant potential to move Cornell commuters out of SOVs and into
       alternative modes of transportation if incentive programs and improvements are put in place.
       She said the analysis also shows that impacts of most of the hypothetical Cornell population
       growth can be mitigated by moving Cornell commuters to alternative modes of transportation
       through TDM programs.
         Bill Wendt said that in the fall all Cornell first-year students will be provided a no-fee bus
         pass for their first year at the university, and a reduced-fee pass for their remaining time at
         Cornell. Additionally, all undergraduate and graduate students will be provided no-fee
         evening and weekend passes. Kathryn Wolf noted that the no-fee evening and weekend
         passes, as well as the TCAT transit route service study were ideas that surfaced during the
         development of the t-GEIS and are being put into motion now rather than waiting until the t-
         GEIS is complete.
         Nat Grier presented estimated increases in Cornell TDM participants for each hypothetical
         growth scenario. He noted that if these TDM participation rates were realized they could


                                                           1 of 2
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                             Appendix D



         mitigate all of the impacts of hypothetical new Cornell population growth in Scenarios 2 and
         3 and about two-thirds of the impacts in Scenario 4. The remainder of the Scenario 4
         mitigations likely would need to be achieved through roadway improvements. Ed Marx asked
         whether he was correct in his interpretation that as population grows at the university, Cornell
         will "ratchet" up its efforts to increase TDM participation, rather than instituting mitigations
         regardless of population growth. Bill Wendt said that generally was correct, although he
         noted that some mitigation strategies will need to be put in place now in anticipation of future
         population growth.
    4. Herb Engman said he appreciated the potential mitigation strategies related to land use and
       transportation, although he said he felt the language that Cornell will "advocate" for these
       strategies is too soft. He said he would prefer to see stronger language, such as Cornell will
       "commit" to these strategies. Thys Van Cort and Jonathan Kanter said they agreed. Bill
       Wendt noted that Cornell does necessarily feel it should lead the housing issue, but rather
       work with the appropriate municipalities.
    5. Fernando de Aragón noted that there may be an opportunity for Cornell to share its
       experience with TDM programs with other employers in the area, to help them establish their
       own TDM programs. Bill Wendt said he was supportive of that concept.

                                      Date Minutes Prepared: June 15, 2007

    Attendees:          City of Ithaca: Tim Logue
                        Cornell University: Shirley Egan, Bill Wendt

    1. The committee approved minutes from the 03/28/07 meeting.
    2. Nat Grier distributed a document titled "Intersection Analysis Summary". All sixty-six
       intersections included in the analysis are summarized. The attached tables identifying the
       following were reviewed: intersections with poor LOS today (poor LOS is defined as LOS
       D); additional intersections expected to have a poor LOS in 2016 without Cornell population
       growth, but with background traffic growth; and additional intersections expected to have a
       poor LOS in 2016 if population growth impacts from Scenario #4 are unmitigated. It was
       generally agreed that there were no big surprises in the intersections identified as either
       already having a poor LOS or in those expected to in the future. Improvements are already
       planned for some of these intersections. It was also generally agreed that even if there was no
       Cornell population growth, it would be desirable to improve many of the intersections listed
       for the purposes of safety, and the pedestrian and bicycle improvements that would be
       incorporated. Tim Logue cautioned that we shouldn't emphasize safety as a reason for the
       improvements because we have not technically conducted a safety analysis. Ed Marx stated
       that the CMP proposal will make some pedestrian routes more important.
    3. J. Kanter suggested that we should start thinking about TIMS in terms of coordinating with
       the CMP. He would like to see the TIMS identify big ideas of the CMP and figure out how
       we will address them. B. Wendt said the CMP won't be done in time to incorporate in TIMS.
       However, the 5-year update of the TIMS can address this.
    4. D. Kwasnowski asked if cost estimates will be included. Dan thought it would be good to see
       how much all the intersections would cost if it was federally funded, how much it would cost
       if it were done now, and how much it would cost if it were done in the future.
    5. K. Wolf provided an overview of the Public Open Houses and explained how the public
       comments were being recorded. She explained that the public comments were reviewed, and
       where the consultant team agreed with the recommendation, it was included on the diagram
       titled "Potential Transportation Improvements and Neighborhood Concepts". Ed Marx
       expressed concern that the county was not consulted regarding proposals on county roads. K.
       Wolf agreed to schedule a meeting with the county to review proposals on county roads and
       also to meet with NYSDOT to review proposals on state roads.
    6. Ed Marx stated that he is concerned about what everything is going to cost and how it is
       going to get done. G. Alexiou reminded the group that we are identifying problems whether



                                                           1 of 2
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                            Appendix D



         or not they are created by Cornell and we are identifying solutions that will benefit the
         community and that the intention was that all bodies would work together to find solutions. If
         Cornell was truly interested in the minimum investment, the intersection analysis shows that
         they could fix a few intersections and be done with it. B. Wendt stated that he wants to
         emphasize TDM programs and be out in front of the growth. J. Kanter stated that many of the
         issues brought up by neighborhood residents regarding corridors and intersections are not
         Cornell's responsibility. Ed Marx reminded the group that a community transportation plan is
         not the same as the t-GEIS.

    1. The committee approved minutes from the 02/27/07 meeting. Herb Engman said that while
       he did not attend that meeting he was interested to read the discussion about the relationship
       between housing and transportation in the minutes. He said he hoped housing would be
       included as a mitigation measure in the t-GEIS. Kathryn Wolf noted that the t-GEIS will
       include a section regarding the relationship between land use and transportation, which will
       include information about housing.
    2. Committee members reported on current transportation-related projects in the county. Ed
       Marx said the Hanshaw Road reconstruction project is still moving forward and he hopes
       construction will begin in spring 2008. Jonathan Kanter said the Town Transportation
       Committee has received a draft of the Forest Home Traffic Calming Plan and is currently
       reviewing it. He said the Transportation Committee also has approved the Town
       Transportation Plan and it now will go to the Town Board for final approval, hopefully in
       May. Fernando de Aragón said a public meeting RE the TIP proposals will be held on April 9
       as part of the 30-day comment period.
         The t-GEIS consultants presented preliminary mitigation strategies for the t-GEIS and TIMS.
         Kathryn Wolf presented mitigation strategies targeted toward enhancing bicycle and
         pedestrian facilities and enhancing a bike culture in the community. She said while the focus
         would be on encouraging more people to cycle to Cornell, the benefits would be community-
         wide not exclusive to Cornell. Fernando de Aragón said he supports enhancing bike and
         pedestrian amenities and he hopes this mitigation strategy will receive support from all levels
         of the Cornell administration since these groups rarely are given priority over vehicles. Herb
         Engman recommended that education for drivers be included in the "bike culture" campaign.
         Ed Marx cautioned that the t-GEIS should not rely too much on mitigation measures that
         others are responsible for. He said improving county roads to accommodate cyclists includes
         many elements such as culvertizing drainage ditches in order to widen road shoulders. The
         county has estimated it could cost around $15 million to make such necessary improvements
         to safely accommodate cyclists on its roads, and at this time that money is not available.
         George Alexiou said that while the money may not currently be available, many of these
         mitigation measures should still be included in the plan. Jonathan Kanter noted that there are


                                                           1 of 2
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                             Appendix D



         certain roads that currently are in poor condition and require reconstruction, so bike facility
         improvements could be included in the road reconstruction projects. Fernando recommended
         establishing priorities and doing some feasibility analysis for these priorities.
         Nat Grier said the t-GEIS consultants have met with TCAT officials and the t-GEIS will
         recommend that TCAT do a comprehensive, community-wide transit service study. George
         Alexiou said such a study would help determine what transit means for the community as a
         whole and help determine what the community would like to see as improvements in the
         future. Ed Marx cautioned against making TCAT too Cornell-centric. He said he is concerned
         that could leave a gap in servicing rural areas. Bill Wendt pointed out that the current fixed
         route way TCAT is serving rural areas may not be the best way. Other strategies to better
         serve rural areas may be identified in the transit service study. Nicole Tedesco agreed that
         TCAT may want to look at other ways to address rural service.
         Nat Grier said Park and Ride lots are very important mitigation measures. He said the Park
         and Ride survey conducted in April 2006 helped determine five primary locations for lots
         near employment centers in the community. He said Cornell can assist in developing the Park
         and Ride system by making land available in some locations.
         Nat Grier provided an overview of TDM mitigation measures that Cornell is recommending.
         George Alexiou pointed out that Cornell already has a very good TDM program, but the t-
         GEIS analysis indicates that there is room to improve them. Tim Logue also noted that people
         should be encouraged to make decisions about where they live that minimize their
         transportation impacts, such as finding housing on a bus line.
         Nat Grier also provided an overview of intersection LOS analysis and possible intersection
         improvements. Kathryn Wolf noted that the potential intersection improvements are not
         necessarily being recommended at this point. Rather, the idea is to avoid impacts through
         TDM programs. Bill Wendt said that intersection improvements could be built into
         appropriate municipal work plans, and done as roads are reconstructed. Fernando de Aragón
         and Ed Marx recommended that the t-GEIS consultants provide this LOS analysis to
         Resource Committee members for further review.
    3. Herb Engman encouraged including flex hours as a mitigation in the t-GEIS. He pointed out
       that this would allow people to arrive at and leave work at staggered times, rather than during
       peak hours.

                                        Meeting Minutes

                                Meeting Date: February 22, 2007
                              Date Minutes Prepared: March 7, 2007

                  Tompkins County: Ed Marx
                  Town of Dryden: Dan Kwasnowski
                  Town of Ithaca: Susan Brock, Jonathan Kanter
                  Trowbridge & Wolf Landscape Architects: Annette Marchesseault, Kathryn
                  Wolf

 1. Susan Brock requested that the first sentence of the second paragraph under item 5 in the
    minutes from the 1/11/07 minutes be revised to read: "Susan Brock said she is not convinced
    that the sole focus should be on faculty/staff..." The Resource Committee agreed to accept
    the minutes from the 1/11/07 meeting with that revision.
 2. Committee members were asked to report on current transportation projects in their
    jurisdictions that are relevant to the t-GEIS. Dan Kwasnowski said the Town of Dryden
    currently is working to develop a multi-use trail that would extend from the East Ithaca
    Recreation Way to the Village of Freeville. He also noted that there is a need for Park & Ride
    facilities that would intercept commuters from Cortland who are driving through Dryden.
     Tim Logue said the City's TIP requests for reconstructing University Avenue and the upper
     portion of East State Street were not funded.
     Sean Murphy said Rt. 13/38 in Dryden will be resurfaced this summer.
     Jonathan Kanter said the final draft of the Town Transportation Plan will be forwarded to the
     Town's Transportation Committee tomorrow (2/23) and it hopefully will be adopted by April.
     He also said the Town and the ITCTC are meeting with Cornell about the North Campus
     Gateway.
     Ed Marx said the County's TIP requests for reconstructing the Pine Tree Road and Ellis          Deleted: studying
     Hollow Road corridors were not funded. He noted that the County currently is conducting a
     study of the Rt. 13/366 corridor with regard to nodal development. He said the County would
     like to also conduct a similar study on NYS Rt. 96.
     Andrew Eastlick said the ITCTC Park & Ride Committee will be meeting within the next few
     weeks to determine how best to use the Park & Ride survey data.
 3. George Alexiou provided a presentation about the traffic impact analysis that has been
    conducted for the t-GEIS and an overview of preliminary mitigation strategies. He pointed
    out that there currently are about 10 intersections and two corridors below level of service
    (LOS) C in the study area (existing condition). Two more intersections and two more
    corridors drop below LOS C with background growth. Two more corridors and another
    intersection drop below LOS C in the Cornell medium-growth scenario and the high-growth



                                                1 of 3
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                                   Appendix D


     scenario causes one more intersection and one more corridor to drop below LOS C.
     Obviously, background growth and the various Cornell growth scenarios continue to diminish
     the LOS levels at intersections that currently are near or below LOS C.
     He said the bottom-line message is that the analysis shows that there are existing problems
     today and they get somewhat worse with background growth and Cornell growth scenarios,
     but the Cornell growth scenarios do not have an overwhelming impact.
     He said now that the traffic analysis has been completed the t-GEIS team is using data from
     the Travel Survey to develop proposals for ways to reduce single-occupancy vehicle use, thus
     mitigating traffic impacts projected in the Cornell growth scenarios. He said the preliminary
     mitigation measures are focusing on: 1) Transportation Demand Management (TDM), which
     are policies and programs that encourage commuters to use alternatives to SOV's; 2) physical
     improvements to facilities and services for non-motorists, such as pedestrians, bikers and
     transit users, and 3) physical improvements to roads and intersections where necessary and
     acceptable to the community, particularly to enhance safety and livability. He said Cornell's
     goal in the t-GEIS is to identify a wide range of options for commuters. The Travel Survey
     data confirmed that there is the potential to increase Cornell commuters' use of alternatives to
     SOV commuting. However, he pointed out, while the t-GEIS will identify many potential
     improvements, community-wide support will be required to realize many of those
     improvements, since many of them are beyond Cornell's jurisdiction. He noted that there
     needs to be a holistic system. As an instance, Park & Ride will not be successful if designated
     lots are provided but bus service is not reliable.
 4. Dan Kwasnowski asked whether there was any way to measure how many people used to use
    certain alternative modes of transportation, such as riding the bus, but stopped doing so for
    some reason or another. Bill Wendt said it is his professional opinion that many people stop
    riding the bus, for instance, because of childcare or other family issues, but they tend to return
    when those issues are not longer relevant. George Alexiou pointed out that the Travel Survey
    now provides a baseline of how the Cornell community commutes to campus, so changes can
    be tracked accurately every few year.
 5. Fernando de Aragón asked whether options for revised Cornell parking policies in the t-GEIS
    will include "pay as you go" options. George Alexiou said that option will be considered.
    Fernando pointed out that the appendix to the NESTS study contains some information about
    this option. He also recommended that physical improvements be recommended for roads and
    the overall biking network so bikers will feel safer.
 6. Susan Brock asked whether the "Trip Planner" on the TCAT web site was used in the
    transportation analysis, because she has noticed that it does not provide accurate information.
    Nat Grier said his firm noticed those inaccuracies so did not rely on the "Trip Planner." Susan
    also recommended that in future presentations the term "pedestrian network" be used instead
    of "sidewalk" network.
 7. Ed Marx said he feels that housing needs to be on the t-GEIS list of mitigations. Fernando de
    Aragón pointed out that there is a section in the t-GEIS that will address "Transportation and
    Land Use" and he hopes it will include recommendations for increasing residential density in
    certain areas. Ed said Cornell could recommend areas appropriate for dense residential
    development on its own land. Jonathan Kanter noted that there is an opportunity for the
    Cornell Master Plan (CMP) and the t-GEIS to identify land use opportunities that are
    mutually beneficial for the community and for the university. Tim Logue said Seneca Place is
    a good example of this. Jonathan also noted that Cornell could provide an incentive program,
    such as mortgage assistance, to encourage employees to purchase housing in targeted areas.

transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                                 Appendix D


     Bill Wendt said the t-GEIS will not have specific recommendations with regard to land use or
     where to locate housing. He said the CMP is taking the lead on these issues. The t-GEIS role
     is to provide recommendations about the transportation components of specific CMP
     proposals, as they relate to commuting to campus. He also noted that housing generally is a
     community-wide issue and there are existing initiatives in the community that are beginning
     to address the issue. Jonathan Kanter said he sees an opportunity for the t-GEIS to provide
     recommendations to the CMP about the need for housing close to the university. He said if
     the t-GEIS and the CMP are viewed as two entirely separate entities they will not be
     particularly useful.
     Ed Marx said the Tompkins County Council of Governments is working to develop a strategy
     document that will, in part, encourage major employers to provide incentives for employees
     to purchase housing in targeted areas, and that nodal development will be encouraged. He
     pointed out that nodal, or densified, residential development provides a critical mass of
     people to make transit successful. He asked what type of future housing distribution the t-
     GEIS transportation analysis assumed. Bill Wendt said the analysis assumed that housing
     patterns would continue as they exist today, since that would be the worst case scenario. Ed
     said he feels strongly that even though the t-GEIS is not charged with making housing
     recommendations, it should include information about how land use and housing location
     directly influence transportation choices.
     Dan Kwasnowski noted that while it is easy to lay blame on Cornell for many issues, he
     agrees that there should be a County-wide initiative with regard to the housing issue, since it
     is so complicated and crosses so many boundaries. Ed Marx said he feels Cornell needs to
     provide support for such an initiative, even though the municipalities would be responsible
     for implementing it.
 8. The meeting adjourned at 3:30 pm. The next Resource Committee meeting will be March 28
    from 1:30-3:30 at the Borg Warner Room of the Tompkins County Public Library downtown.

                                         Meeting Date: January 11, 2007
                                    Date Minutes Prepared: January 15, 2007

    Attendees:          City of Ithaca: JoAnn Cornish, Bill Gray, Tim Logue
                        Cornell University: Bill Wendt, Shirley Egan, Mina Amundsen, Andrew

    1. The Resource Committee voted to accept the minutes from the last meeting held on 03/27/06.
    2. Committee members were asked to introduce themselves since some new member have
       joined the Committee. Sean Murphy has replaced Bill Egloff as the DOT representative, and
       Cornell University Planner Mina Amundsen has joined the Committee.
    3. Committee members were asked to provide a brief overview of transportation-related projects
       that are under way or proposed in their jurisdictions. Ed Marx said Tompkins County
       currently is conducting a corridor analysis of Rts. 13 and 366, with an emphasis on looking
       for opportunities for nodal development. He said the project currently is approximately 50
       percent complete. He said the County also currently is involved in reconstruction projects for
       Hanshaw Road, Coddington Road and Warren Road north of Rt. 13.
         Fernando de Aragón said the ITCTC currently is reviewing a number of TIP proposals from
         the City, the Town and the County. He said one proposal of note is for the DOT to study the
         Rt. 13/Rt. 34 intersection south of the City for safety and improved traffic operation. Ed
         Marx clarification via e-mail on 1/22/07: This is a proposed widening of Route 13 south of
         the City to its intersection with Rt 34 rather than improvements to that intersection.
         Sean Murphy added that he can provide a map indicating all TIP applications from
         jurisdictions in Tompkins County.
         Tim Logue said the City has submitted TIP applications to reconstruct University Avenue and
         East State Street from Mitchell Street east to the City line to improve traffic conditions and to
         add bike and pedestrian amenities. Bill Gray said another City TIP application is for
         continuation of upgrading traffic signals in the City so they "talk" to each other and to the
         DOT signals.
         Ed Marx said the County has submitted TIP applications to study adding pedestrian and bike
         amenities along Pine Tree Road and Ellis Hollow Road.
         Jonathan Kanter reported that the Town Transportation Plan has been reviewed at two public
         hearings. The Town currently is in the process of making revisions and the plan should be
         submitted to the Town Board for final review within the next couple of months.

transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                             Appendix D



         Mina Amundsen reported that Cornell is undertaking a Comprehensive Master Plan for
         physical development of the campus. She said the master plan is looking at the long term
         (25+ years) and is focused on development on campus, whereas the t-GEIS is looking at the
         short term (10 years) and is focused on transportation systems off campus.
         Dan Kwasnowski said that the Town of Dryden is rewriting the zoning for the hamlet of
         Varna. The new zoning will propose traffic calming and changes in land use.
    4. Kathryn Wolf provided a review of the overall t-GEIS process and reported on the public
       workshops held in Spring 2006. She said the t-GEIS consultants have been synthesizing
       written and verbal comments from the workshops into a graphic format which is helping to
       inform how comments should be addressed.
    5. Nat Grier and George Alexiou presented the results of the Travel Survey of Cornell faculty,
       staff and students conducted in Spring 2006. George said the survey response (46%) was one
       of the highest they have ever seen. Nat said survey questions were designed to provide an
       understanding of commuter attitudes and what changes would attract commuters to use
       alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles, and to determine the "market potential" for
       alternative modes of travel. He said the survey shows that more than 50 percent of faculty and
       staff (approximately 5,500) currently drive alone to/from work, while nearly 20 percent of
       graduate students and approximately five percent of undergraduates drive alone. He said
       since faculty/staff represent the largest group that is driving alone and the majority of them
       travel during peak commuting hours, they represent a significant opportunity for shifting into
       transportation demand management (TDM) programs. He said the survey indicates that the
       top three potential "markets" for TDM are: 1) increased bus ridership, 2) carpool programs,
       and 3) vanpool programs.
         Susan Brock said she is not convinced that the focus should be on faculty/staff since they
         indicated that they feel they need to drive because they use their cars for errands also,
         whereas graduate students indicated that if they owned a car it made sense to use it to
         commute. Bill Gray said that while the focus may be on faculty/staff, the t-GEIS should not
         overlook opportunities to get students out of their cars. Bill Wendt said focusing TDM
         strategies on faculty/staff likely would yield the "biggest bang for the buck."
         Nat said the best way to maximize the effect of TDM programs, such as the bus, is to focus
         on people who come and go once at each end of the day (ie, during the peak commuting
         hours), and these are primarily faculty/staff. He pointed out that approximately only 20
         percent of faculty/staff said no improvement could make them take the bus, which indicates
         that 80 percent may be willing to take the bus under the right conditions. Getting even half of
         that 80 percent to ride the bus instead of drive would still represent a significant number.
    6. Nat Grier said that another interesting survey result was that less than 10 percent of
       respondents said "close, affordable housing" would encourage them to walk more, while
       more than 30 percent said they would walk more often if they "live(d)" closer, indicating that
       affordability may not be the only factor in choosing where to live. Jonathan Kanter and Ed
       Marx cautioned against interpreting that this means affordable housing is not a significant
       issue, because other studies have indicated otherwise.
    7. Bill Wendt and Kathryn Wolf said Cornell is developing an executive summary of the Travel
       Survey which will be distributed to the Resource Committee when it is complete.
    8. Tim Logue asked if results of the 2005 Park & Ride survey would be used in conjunction
       with the results of this Travel Survey. Nat Grier said they would, and that the Travel Survey
       had been deliberately designed to have a little bit of overlap with the Park & Ride survey.

    9. Fernando de Aragón asked how much detail about park and ride will be included in the t-
       GEIS. George Alexiou said he would have a better idea after meeting with TCAT.
    10. Cathy Valentino said lack of affordable, convenient daycare is one of the biggest concerns
        she has heard from Cornell employees during the past 20 years. She pointed out that park and
        ride locations could be good locations for other conveniences such as daycare, dry cleaning,
        grocery shopping, etc. Bill Wendt said the university currently is engaged in the first phase of
        proposing expanded daycare opportunities on or near the campus. Jonathan Kanter said the
        Town is very interested in knowing the proposed location for a Cornell daycare facility.
    11. Herb Engman said he is still very concerned about affordable housing. He pointed out that
        Cornell owns most of the land close in that would be appropriate for housing development.
        He said the Town has met with as many of the decision makers at Cornell as they can think
        of, including President Skorton. Bill Wendt pointed out that a Mayor's Roundtable has been
        established to address the issue. Ed Marx said that in the next couple of months the County
        will be coming out with strategies about providing more affordable housing.
    12. Ed Marx said he is anxious to hear what the t-GEIS proposed mitigations will be. He noted
        that members of the Resource Committee would like to discuss proposed mitigations as they
        are being developed. Kathryn Wolf and Andrew Eastlick said the agenda for the February
        Resource Committee meeting will include presentation of the traffic and livability impact
        analysis and preliminary proposed mitigations. They said this presentation likely will
        continue at the March Resource Committee meeting.
    13. Ed Marx said he feels it will be particularly important to know t-GEIS proposed mitigations
        as the master plan is being developed. He said he is concerned that the t-GEIS may be falling
        behind the CMP. Bill Wendt and Kathryn Wolf assured Ed that the t-GEIS is not falling
        behind the CMP. They said the t-GEIS consultants met with the CMP consultants in
        December and were able to provide research and analysis results that were helpful to the
        CMP process. Bill said Mina Amundsen, the Cornell university planner, will serve as a
        liaison between the t-GEIS and the CMP on the Resource Committee.
    14. The next Resource Committee meeting will be February 22. The meeting adjourned at 3:00
        pm.

    1. The Resource Committee voted unanimously to accept the minutes from the 01/09/06
       meeting.
    2. Fernando de Aragón said public participation has been requested at Resource Committee
       meetings. He said the Committee is not legally obligated to make the meetings open to the
       public, but said he feels it would not be good to exclude the public from the meetings either.
       He cautioned that if Resource Committee meetings are open to the public they cannot become
       public hearings. Bill Gray said he feels that the Committee has been established to deal with
       technical issues, and public participation could weigh down discussions of those issues. Ed
       Marx said he feels that the public should be allowed to attend as observers only. Cathy
       Valentino suggested that the chair be allowed to recognize public attendees to speak briefly if
       they have important input. JoAnn Cornish pointed out that there are other forums for public
       comment on the t-GEIS. Steve Farkas suggested that members of the public be allowed to
       submit written comments to the Committee. Shirley Egan noted that written comments could
       be very lengthy and the Committee would be obligated to read them and respond to them.
         It was agreed that members of the public are allowed to attend Resource Committee meetings
         as observers and that the chair will use his judgment regarding allowing them to speak. Cathy
         Valentino said that if public attendance, but not comment, is allowed at Resource Committee
         meetings it will be very important for municipal representatives to "funnel" public comments
         back to the Committee.
    3. Annette Marchesseault provided an update on a web-based survey that Cornell is distributing
       to Cornell faculty, staff and students about transportation issues, particularly what would
       encourage more use of alternate modes of transportation. She said representatives from the
       various assemblies at Cornell have provided input, and the survey will be distributed to
       approximately 15,000 people, which includes all graduate students and a random sample of
       undergraduate students, faculty and staff. The survey will be distributed in mid-April. Dwight
       Mengel asked whether the survey will be assessing where people are coming from in order to
       gauge modal splits. Nat Grier said the survey will be asking respondents to provide direction

         they are traveling from, distance they are traveling and what mode of transportation they are
         using.
    4. George Alexiou provided a review of roads selected for detailed corridor analysis. He noted
       that corridor analysis generally will stop one mile outside the Cornell hypothetical population
       growth area because studies have shown that traffic from a certain source generally becomes
       widely dispersed when it gets more than a mile from the source. George said corridor analysis
       will focus on road-related issues and adjacent land use, but there will be overlap between
       corridor analysis, intersection analysis and neighborhood analysis. He said intersections
       selected for analysis will be selected in part based on the corridors selected for analysis.
       Kathryn Wolf added that data will be collected for all three of these items within the next few
       weeks before school is out and people begin to leave for the summer.
    5. Committee discussed that "Cornell hypothetical population growth area," isn't an accurate
       term because the population growth will occur largely outside that area. It was agreed that
       the term "Cornell destination area" is more accurate. (This addition to the minutes was
       received from Susan Brock on 4/5/06.)
    6. Kathryn Wolf provided an update on neighborhood character and livability analysis. She said
       neighborhood analysis will be conducted along areas of approach corridors that go through
       residential neighborhoods, and some additional roads closer to campus that are not
       necessarily primary approach corridors but could experience an increase in traffic will be
       added for neighborhood character and livability analysis. She said the t-GEIS Working Group
       has initially selected roads to be added for neighborhood analysis and will confirm them with
       a group of representatives from the City and the Town. Workshops to collect information
       from neighborhoods will be conducted in May.
    7. George Alexiou presented the list of data that will be collected for approach corridor and
       neighborhood character and livability analysis. Bill Gray asked whether "building density" on
       the list is meant to indicate density of building of footprints or number of residents in
       buildings. George said both conditions will be taken into account. Herb Engman asked
       whether informal or "de facto" pedestrian crossings will be noted in the analysis. George said
       they will to the extent that they can be determined. Kathryn Wolf said the neighborhood
       workshops will be very helpful to determine this sort of information. Dwight Mengel
       suggested adding transit volume and capacity to the data collection list.
    8. George Alexiou and Nat Grier provided an update on intersections that will be selected for
       analysis. George reminded the Committee that the purpose of this study is not to do
       exhaustive intersection analysis, but to determine trends and areas where there may be
       problems due to hypothetical Cornell population growth, and that criteria was established in
       the scope to help determine which intersections should be analyzed. He said two intersections
       that were recommended during the scoping process failed to meet criterion a and 15 failed to
       meet criterion b.
         Ed Marx said he feels that the Sapsucker Woods/Brown Road/NYS Rt. 13 intersection should
         not be eliminated because it is very controversial. He also noted that the King Road/NYS Rt.
         96B intersection has a signal on the major corridor so should not be eliminated. Cathy
         Valentino said she does not feel that the Burns Road/NYS Rt. 79 intersection should be
         eliminated because it has a high accident rate, and could warrant more control measures.
         Jonathan Kanter said the Town still is collecting LOS data to provide to M/A/B, which could
         add some intersections back to the list. Tim Logue asked whether M/A/B will be moving
         outward in its analysis if it determines that there is a problem at an intersection near campus,
         in order to determine the source of the problem. George pointed out that traffic generally



                                                           2 of 3
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                             Appendix D



         starts to disperse by the time it is a mile away from the source. Cathy Valentino asked for a
         list of intersections that are being "dropped" according to the criteria.
         Bill Gray noted that the Committee discussion has been focusing on "things we know today"
         but the intention of the t-GEIS study is to get information that "we don't know." He
         cautioned that by focusing on some specific intersections such as Brown Road/NYS 13 the
         study could get to a size that is unmanageable. George said it is important to ask "What will
         we do with this data when we get it?"
         Ed Marx said the one-mile boundary seems "arbitrarily" drawn, and some very important
         intersections just outside the boundary have been missed. George asked whether Ed feels the
         one-mile boundary is irrelevant and should be dropped. Ed said no, but he feels it should be a
         little bit flexible. He recommended including intersections that are just outside the one-mile
         boundary to the north such as NYS 366/NYS 13, Triphammer Road/NYS 13 and Warren
         Road/NYS 13. He noted that future housing is likely to grow in these areas, since there is not
         much room for housing growth within the one-mile boundary. George said that analysis will
         be done by distributing effects of Cornell hypothetical population growth according to
         existing housing patterns, then modifying it according to what is known about anticipated
         future housing patterns.
         Susan Brock asked what will be included in the intersection analysis. Nat Grier said it will
         include information about left and right turns, seconds of delay, etc. He said intersection
         analysis is a "reality" check. Some corridors may be working just fine but some intersections
         may be near failing. George added that analysis for intersections along a corridor can be
         useful to help determine what (if any) improvements to make along a corridor. Susan noted
         that there will be some interest in whether LOS is going to decrease at some of the
         intersections beyond the one-mile boundary.
         Bill Gray reiterated that the purpose of the t-GEIS is to determine improvements that should
         be made in the future. The purpose is not to address specific existing problems. Nat Grier
         pointed out that it is important to keep the number of intersections to be analyzed
         manageable. Tim Logue said he could recommend eliminating a few redundant intersections
         in the City if King Road/NYS Rt. 96B, NYS Rt. 96/Hospital, Triphammer Road/NYS Rt. 13
         and NYS Rt. 13/NYS/Rt. 366 are added back.
    9. Kathryn Wolf provided an update on the schedule. She said a bike/pedestrian workshop
       tentatively has been scheduled for April 25 and the neighborhood workshops are scheduled
       for May 1 and 3.
    10. It was agreed that the next Resource Committee meeting will be on May 22.
    11. The Committee established 05/22/06 as the tentative date for the next meeting. The meeting
        adjourned at 3:00 p.m.

                        Also: Bruce Brittain, Doug Brittain

    1. The Resource Committee voted unanimously to accept the minutes from the 12/21/05
       meeting.
    2. Kathryn Wolf provided a summary of public comments received during the public scoping
       period. She said there were 16 comments provided ­ 11 oral and five written. She said the
       majority of those commenting indicated that they felt the draft Scope focused too much on
       vehicular traffic, and requested more emphasis on pedestrian and bicycle issues and on issues
       related to neighborhood "livability." She noted that Bruce and Doug Brittain submitted their
       own version of a revised draft scope during the 1/3/06 public scoping hearing, although they
       had orally presented most of the items in that document during the 12/6/05 public scoping
       hearing.
         Herb Engman said the "revised draft scope" Bruce and Doug Brittain submitted reflects the
         official position of the Forest Home Improvement Association and was signed by members of
         five other neighborhood associations, but that it not reflected in the Response Matrix, which
         should be corrected.
         Kathryn said the public comments made Cornell aware that it needed to better communicate
         its intention with regard to information that will be evaluated for neighborhoods.
    3. Kathryn Wolf provided an overview of Cornell's revisions to the draft Scope with regard to
       neighborhoods. She said new sections focusing on neighborhoods have been added which
       will identify the existing transportation systems and issues evaluated in previous sections on
       pedestrians, bicycles, transit and vehicular traffic, as they relate to neighborhoods. Where
       analysis indicates that an increase in traffic will significantly impact a neighborhood, more
       detailed "livability" issues will be examined for that neighborhood. She said this will not be
       an exhaustive inventory of "livability" issues because that is not necessary for this project.
    4. Bill Gray said he was concerned by the amount of detail being requested in the public
       comments at the 1/3/06 public scoping session. He pointed out that the t-GEIS is evaluating
       generic population growth on the Cornell campus and where growth may occur on campus



                                                           1 of 4
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                                  Appendix D



         has not yet been determined. He said that level of detail is too specific for a broad, generic
         study such as this. Kathryn Wolf noted that many people are not accustomed to a generic
         environmental impact statement, so tend to make comments about issues they are familiar
         with.
    5. Herb Engman said that if mitigation strategies which may affect neighborhoods are going to
       be approved as part of this project, then neighborhood issues need to be evaluated now.
    6. Kathryn Wolf pointed out that individual capital projects will still go through site plan
       review, and if it is determined that transportation issues related to those projects have not
       been adequately addressed in the t-GEIS, then a separate environmental review will need to
       be conducted for those projects.
    7. Bill Gray again pointed out that this is a broad, generic study and it is not, for instance, a
       zoning study, by the end of which all details would be fixed.
    8. Susan Brock noted that the way Findings Statements on the t-GEIS are structured will
       determine whether an environmental review will be required for a future capital project.
    9. Susan Brock said she did not understand what was being proposed for the neighborhood
       sections in the revised draft Scope and the Response Matrix and recommended making the
       intention more clear. Kathryn Wolf said the intention is to look at impacts of hypothetical
       Cornell population growth on residential areas along major corridors providing access to the
       campus. George Alexiou pointed out that neighborhood "livability" issues already have been
       examined in other studies, such as the NESTS study, and that information will be referenced
       in the t-GEIS. Kathryn said more detailed analysis will be conducted for some residential
       areas identified as having significant impacts from hypothetical Cornell population growth.
       Fernando de Aragón said he had not picked up that nuance from the language in the revised
       draft Scope.
    10. George Alexiou pointed out that mitigation strategies will benefit all traffic, not just
        additional traffic.
    11. Ed Marx said it is important to make clear that impacts on neighborhoods are not just traffic-
        related. He pointed out that some mitigation strategies, such as more busses, could also have
        impacts on neighborhoods. George Alexiou said that examining projected impacts in specific
        areas may be too fine a level of detail for a broad study such as this. Bill Gray added that if
        impacts are studied for a hypothetical building location, for instance, but the building is never
        constructed in that location, then the level of detail of the impact analysis would be
        unnecessary. He recommended examining impacts in a more general manner ­ for instance
        general impacts associated with constructing sidewalks in residential areas. Ed said he was
        comfortable with that method.
    12. Thys Van Cort asked whether the hypothetical growth boundary in Figure 1 should be revised
        to reflect downtown since Cornell is moving office space downtown. Bill Wendt said one
        way to mitigate population growth on Cornell's central campus is to move offices and other
        facilities off campus, and each such project would require its own site plan review, therefore
        the boundary does not need to be adjusted. Jonathan Kanter said that if a mitigation strategy
        is to move office space off central campus, without identifying a specific location, then the
        evaluation of impacts should be general. However, if the mitigation strategy is to move office
        space to a specific location, such as downtown, then the evaluation of impacts should be more
        specific. Bill Wendt agreed with that. He said that there may be many good reasons for
        moving more Cornell employees downtown, even though such a move might require more
        traffic mitigation and adjustment to Cornell TDM programs. Bill Gray asked whether there



                                                           2 of 4
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                               Appendix D



         might be a method for providing "credits" exempting Cornell from some requirements if it
         institutes certain mitigations, such as dispersing jobs from central campus.
    13. Kathryn Wolf reviewed the methodology for engaging neighborhoods. She said the Ithaca
        Neighborhoods Council and the University Neighborhoods Council are existing umbrella
        groups that have been asked to sponsor meetings with regard to t-GEIS neighborhood issues.
        Cathy Valentino said this strategy makes a lot of sense. It does not exclude neighborhoods
        and it captures residents living in areas that do not have formal neighborhood associations.
    14. The Committee reviewed the revised draft Scope and the Response Matrix. George Alexiou
        said it never was Cornell's intention to just focus on just vehicular traffic. He said in Section
        3.1.4.1 corridors will be examined on several levels ­ neighborhood issues will be included in
        analysis of corridors close to the campus, whereas on corridors further out the analysis will be
        more focused on vehicular circulation. He said it is also important to ask what the intention
        was when certain intersections were added to the list of intersections to be studied. Were
        people concerned about the LOS of the intersection? Were they concerned about safety? He
        pointed out that if no one is willing to increase the carrying capacity of an intersection, then it
        is not realistic to study it and propose mitigation strategies for it.
         Fernando de Aragón said that during the NESTS study it was determined that there was not a
         lot of public opposition to individual intersection mitigations, such as adding a turning lane,
         but there was recognition that there are many "mature" neighborhoods in which a three- or
         four- or five-lane road would be strongly opposed. George asked whether the proposed traffic
         analysis is necessary. Andrew Eastlick pointed out that such analysis could be useful for
         deliberating bodies to make decisions, such as whether to widen a road or spend money to
         improve alternate modes of travel instead. George agreed and said that there are reasons to do
         traffic analysis with the goal of improving traffic flow.
         Thys Van Cort asked for a definition of traffic efficiency. Bill Gray said it means greater
         efficiency of traffic moving through the system, which could include less stop time, which
         increases efficiency and reduces pollution. Cathy Valentino noted that traffic efficiency is a
         measure of the length of time required to get from one point to another. Bill Egloff clarified
         that it is a measure of the reliability of the time it takes. Dan Kwasnowski pointed out that
         improved traffic efficiency could encourage people to drive more.
         Herb Engman said that intersection analysis in neighborhoods should include quality of life
         evaluation. He said improving traffic flow at certain intersections in neighborhoods may not
         be in the best interest of the neighborhood. Ed Marx and Thys Van Cort pointed out that, in
         general, stop-and-go traffic is not good for a neighborhood.
         Herb Engman recommended adding three percent (3%) per year and five percent (5%) per
         year hypothetical growth scenarios since location of proposed buildings on campus are not
         provided. He said that if Cornell is not willing to provide information about specific building
         proposals then it is not "acting in good faith" with this project. George said Cornell does not
         have specific approved building proposals to provide. Fernando noted that there are two sides
         to the issue: uncertainty with regard to funding makes specific building proposals tenuous,
         but not knowing specific building proposals makes impacts, such as those on neighborhoods,
         uncertain.
         Shirley Egan pointed out that there are building proposals in Cornell's current capital plan
         that have been accounted for under what will be considered existing conditions for the
         purposes of the t-GEIS. She said she felt Cornell was being more honest by examining
         population growth, rather than building square foot growth, since people are the generators of




                                                           3 of 4
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                               Appendix D



         traffic. Ed Marx pointed out that any building projects that are going to occur on the Cornell
         campus in the next five years should already be known.
         Thys said that the type of vehicle contributing to noise (a qualitative impact) should be
         accounted for.
         George noted that air pollution should be reduced if single occupancy vehicle trips are
         reduced. Thys added that hybrid busses and more efficient busses also would reduce air
         pollution.
         Herb asked whether the multiplier effect has been accounted for. George said it will be
         included in the background traffic analysis. Kathryn pointed out that the P.M.-peak, the
         worst-case scenario, is what is being analyzed. If mitigations are made to improve impacts
         during the P.M.-peak, those mitigations will be in place to benefit other travel times as well.
         Ed asked whether examining the proximity of housing to places of employment would be
         included in the scope. Shirley said that it already is included in Section 5.1.1. Ed noted that
         housing is not specifically mentioned.
    15. Bill Wendt said Cornell's current Capital Plan will be added to Section 3.1.1 Relationship to
        Other Current Long-Range Transportation Planning Efforts.
    16. The Committee established 1/23/06 as the tentative date for the next meeting. The meeting
        adjourned at 3:05 p.m.

    1. The Resource Committee voted unanimously to accept the minutes from the 11/07/05
       meeting.
    2. Nicole Tedesco presented an overview of the Town of Ithaca's Transportation Plan which
       currently is being written. She said the difference between the t-GEIS and the Town plan is
       that the t-GEIS will take a broad look at transportation issues and will include general
       recommendations, whereas the Town plan will have some specific recommendations,
       including a map of existing and proposed bike and pedestrian routes in the Town. She said
       alternates for inclusion in the Town plan should be completed by the end of this year and the
       recommendations section will be written next year. Jonathan Kanter added that goals of the
       Town plan include improving pedestrian systems in the Town, reducing reliance on single
       occupancy vehicles and providing more data on traffic volume, speed and accidents. George
       Alexiou asked whether neighborhood issues would be addressed. Nicole said that livability is
       an important focus of the Town plan and a section on traffic calming in neighborhoods will
       be included.
    3. Kathryn Wolf reported on public scoping for the t-GEIS Draft Scope, which occurred at the
       Town Planning Board meeting on 12/06/05. She said there were 11 speakers at the scoping
       session, written comments on the Draft Scope will be accepted by the Town until 12/16/05,
       and the Town Planning Board will hold a second public scoping session on 1/3/06.
         Kathryn recommended that discussion on including issues raised during the public scoping
         not occur until after all comments have been received on 1/3/06.
    4. The Resource Committee reviewed the Draft Scope section by section.
    5. Nicole Tedesco recommended adding a short description of what the t-GEIS will include in
       the Introduction/Background section, in conjunction with the section about what will not be
       included.
    6. Kathryn Wolf distributed an outline of how data will be collected and analyzed for bicycle
       and pedestrian sections of the t-GEIS. She said that a web-based survey might be used to
       determine what might encourage people to use alternate modes of transportation to access
       campus. Jonathan Kanter asked whether this sort of information already had been collected in
       the recently completed Cornell employee commuter survey. Andrew Eastlick and Fernando


                                                           1 of 4
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                                Appendix D



         de Aragón said data from that survey might be useful to establish attitudes toward transit, but
         another survey may be necessary to collect the specific data needed related to bicyclists and
         pedestrians. Andrew noted that this might be limited to a student survey since employees
         were recently surveyed.
         Herb Engman asked how many Cornell employees without access to computers may have
         been missed in the web-based Cornell commuter survey. Andrew said that the survey was
         introduced in a postal mailing and arrangements were made to include people without access
         to computers.
         Fernando pointed out that there already are some very specific proposals with regard to
         pedestrian and bicycle circulation in reports conducted by his office, the Town, the City, etc.,
         and surveys may not be necessary for these issues in the t-GEIS. Andrew agreed that it will
         be important not to duplicate what already has been done, but Cornell already has a system in
         place to conduct web-based surveys of its students, faculty and staff, so it would be simple to
         collect information from this group of users. George Alexiou noted that some information
         also may be collected from stakeholders attending focus groups.
    7. Herb Engman asked how data will be collected about people who come to campus but are not
       regular commuters, such as visitors, people dropping off children at day care, people bringing
       animals to the vet hospital, etc. Kathryn Wolf and George Alexiou pointed out that the t-
       GEIS is focused primarily on regular commuters. George said a multiplier can be used to
       establish a ratio between regular commuters and "other" traffic. Fernando de Aragón noted
       that most of the generators of "other" traffic (eg., the Vet School, Plantations, Statler Hotel,
       the Orchards, day-care, etc.) are fairly spread out on campus.
         Jonathan Kanter asked whether Cornell has accurate data on visitors and "other" traffic.
         Andrew Eastlick said that it is difficult to measure accurately. He pointed out that a multiplier
         is used to address the issue in the City's U-1 zone. Thys Van Cort said that multiplier is not
         reliable and it may be reconsidered. It was agreed that a new section 3.1.4.6 will be added to
         the Draft Scope to address visitor and "other" traffic.
    8. Dwight Mengel said that the transit section of the Draft Scope should incorporate data with
       regard to an increase in bus ridership during the recent spike in gasoline prices. He noted that
       Cornell may be able to help synthesize that data. He said when gas prices were at their peak
       Cornell employee ridership increased by 64 percent, which sometimes was beyond TCAT's
       capacity.
         Andrew Eastlick asked whether the increase in ridership occurred only within Zone 1.
         Dwight said yes, the increase occurred in the Ithaca urban area. He said rural areas
         experienced a steady increase but it was not such a radical increase as in the urban area.
         The Committee agreed that pricing should be included in the TDM sections of the Draft
         Scope.
    9. Kathryn Wolf reviewed the proposed process for engaging nieghborhoods. It will be a three-
       step process. The first step will be to send out a questionnaire. The second step will be to hold
       neighborhood meetings for comments on proposals. The third step will be a facilitated
       meeting with representatives from all neighborhood groups jointly attending to discuss
       proposals and impacts. Solutions for some groups may have impacts on other groups.
    10. Ed Marx said that when a corridor reaches its capacity it becomes difficult to access the
        corridor from side roads, and he asked how that would be addressed in Section 3.1.4.1.
        George Alexiou said there are methods to determine LOS-type data for corridors. Kathryn
        Wolf pointed out that the goal is to increase TDM programs and decrease traffic on corridors.



                                                           2 of 4
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                             Appendix D



         Thys Van Cort pointed out that nearly all corridors leading to Cornell are residential
         neighborhoods and the phrase "environmental carrying capacity" might be most appropriate.
    11. Kathryn Wolf pointed out that several comments at public scoping focused on impacts to
        neighborhoods. Thys Van Cort cautioned that sometimes neighborhood groups will organize
        such that the information they provide might skew the data. Cathy Valentino asked how
        neighborhood boundaries will be identified. Kathryn said that people will be asked to list the
        neighborhood they feel they live in.
         Fernando de Aragón pointed out that a great deal of information about neighborhoods already
         has been collected in studies such as the NESTS study. Fernando said the three primary
         outcomes from the NESTS study are:
              ·    Problematic intersections
              ·    Key implementation projects
              ·    Policy recommendations
         Thys pointed out that the NESTS study did not include the City. He also noted that speed and
         traffic calming are important issues to address. He suggested developing general
         neighborhood traffic calming guidelines rather than going to individual neighborhoods to
         collect data.
         Ed Marx said that proposing neighborhood-specific mitigation measures has the possibility of
         creating a great deal of controversy. He noted that the residents along Coddington and
         Hanshaw Roads have strongly opposed construction of new sidewalks along those roads.
         Herb Engman pointed out that what works as mitigation in one neighborhood may not work
         in another neighborhood.
         George Alexiou pointed out that this study can only get into a conceptual-level of proposed
         mitigations for neighborhoods or the entire study will be bogged down just with
         neighborhood mitigation measures.
         Tim Logue recommended meeting individually with neighborhood groups to collect
         information about concerns, important issues, etc. He said information not applicable to the t-
         GEIS could be distributed to the applicable municipalities. He pointed out that the Town
         Planning Board could help determine which of the comments are or are not applicable to the
         t-GEIS. Nicole Tedesco noted that much of the information may be applicable to the Town
         Transportation Plan.
         The group agreed that a new Section 3.1.6 will be created in the Draft Scope to address
         Cornell-related transportation issues in neighborhoods.
    12. Thys Van Cort recommended adding background information leading to the City parking
        permit systems in Section 3.1.5.
    13. The Committee discussed the next meeting time, date and location. The next meeting will be
        on Monday, December 9, 2006, from 1:00 p.m. ­ 3:00 p.m. A downtown location is
        preferred. Jonathan Kanter will check the availability of the Town Planning conference room.
        (It later was confirmed that the next Resource Committee meeting will be in the Aurora
        Conference Room of the Town Planning Department.)
    14. Jonathan Kanter asked whether the Draft Scope should be revised and redistributed to the
        Town Planning Board prior to the 1/3/06 meeting. It was noted that issuing a new, revised
        Draft Scope could be confusing to the public. It was agreed that Cornell will make a short

         presentation about proposed changes at the beginning of that meeting, but that the Draft
         Scope will not be modified until all public comments are received.
    15. The meeting was adjourned at 3:20 p.m.

    1. The Resource Committee voted unanimously to accept the minutes from the 10/24/05
       meeting.
    2. George Alexiou presented the method that will be used to determine the background traffic
       growth rate. He said that the historic annual traffic growth rate in Tompkins County over the
       last 15 years has been 2.2 percent, which is in line with NYSDOT's assumption of a 2 percent
       annual traffic growth rate. Therefore, George concluded that a 2.2 percent annual traffic
       growth rate was a reasonable starting point. He said the next step was to subtract out
       Cornell's contribution to background traffic. Over the last 30 years Cornell's population has
       consistently comprised 30 percent of the County population and Cornell population growth
       has comprised one-third of the County's population growth in the same time period.
       Therefore a background traffic growth rate of between 70-75 percent, or 1.5 percent
       compounded annually, was established.
         Bill Gray asked whether the background traffic growth was assumed to be universally
         distributed. George said that is the case, but he pointed out that Cornell can be more precise
         in assessing traffic impacts from its future population growth by using geo-coding and other
         methods. Bill noted that a universal background traffic growth rate may not be adequate if
         there is significant growth in a concentrated area in the County. George pointed out that it is
         very difficult to project how the region is going to develop which will affect future
         background growth in specific corridors, and that it may be useful to work with planners in
         the County to try to determine trends.
         Fernando de Aragón pointed out that one disadvantage to the background traffic growth
         method being used is that it does not necessarily address travel corridors that are near or at
         capacity. George said that it was important to establish a reasonable and understandable
         background traffic growth rate, which is why the method he outlined is being used. Everyone
         agreed to the methodology.
         In response to a question about construction traffic, Bill Wendt said that the level of
         construction activity should remain about constant, and therefore it is covered by the
         background traffic. It was noted that this should be explained in the GEIS.



                                                           1 of 4
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                                Appendix D



    3.    Andrew Eastlick presented the hypothetical population growth scenarios that Cornell will
         use in the t-GEIS. They are based on historic population growth on the campus. One scenario
         is based on 30-year historic population growth, which would yield a 0.5 percent per year
         increase in population, or approximately 1,500 persons, over the next 10 years. A second
         scenario is based on population growth from 1990-1999 which would yield a 0.1 percent per
         year population increase, or approximately 300 persons, over the next 10 years. The third
         scenario is based on population growth from 1980-1989, which would yield a 1.0 percent per
         year population increase, or approximately 3,000 persons, over the next 10 years.
         Fernando de Aragón said it might be helpful to break down the population figures even
         further to indicate, for instance, how many undergraduates live on campus. Andrew noted
         that Cornell currently has a recommended cap on undergraduate enrollment, so population
         growth primarily is anticipated among graduate students, staff and faculty. George Alexiou
         and Kathryn Wolf pointed out that Cornell can use geo-coding to determine where all
         commuters living off campus come from.
         Kathryn Wolf pointed out that the hypothetical population growth scenarios to be analyzed
         are for the main campus, within the boundary shown in Andrew's presentation. Thys Van
         Cort asked why the study boundary does not extend beyond the Town line into Dryden. Bill
         Wendt said that within the next 10 years most growth at Cornell is expected to occur on the
         main campus within the identified boundary. Jonathan Kanter pointed out that any substantial
         development at Cornell would take several years to be approved and could be addressed in
         the five-year update of the TIMS.
         Bill Gray recommended that the phrase "For This Study," be added to the title of the diagram
         outlining the area in which the hypothetical population growth will be studied.
         Ed Marx asked how construction traffic for Cornell projects is considered. Andrew Eastlick
         said that construction traffic would be considered in the background traffic. Bill Wendt
         pointed out that construction traffic generally does not occur during the standard a.m. or p.m.
         peak hours. Bill also noted that Cornell generally can only accommodate a certain amount of
         construction at any given time, so construction traffic figures generally are steady. Ed Marx
         said that it is important to make this clear.
         Jonathan Kanter noted that traffic impacts will occur outside the study boundary established
         for Cornell's population growth scenarios.
    4. The Resource Committee reviewed a preliminary list of potential intersections to be analyzed.
       George Alexiou presented proposed criteria to be used to determine which and how many
       intersections would be analyzed in detail. The first step would be to identify major approach
       corridors to campus such as state or county routes, then identify key intersections along those
       thoroughfares that lead to campus. Key intersections would be identified as those that have a
       four-way stop, are signalized on the major route, etc. The second step would be to identify the
       key intersections from step 1 that would be impacted by Cornell population growth. Detailed
       analysis would be conducted for intersections identified in step 2. George pointed out that
       intersections to be studied should be a reasonable distance from campus, such as one mile
       beyond the boundary established for the hypothetical population growth scenarios.
         Bill Gray asked whether it was assumed that all traffic would travel beyond the one-mile
         boundary. George said no, but it is reasonable to assume that traffic will have dispersed
         enough by the time it reaches the boundary to have minimal impact.
         George added that another component of the criteria would be that if Cornell population
         growth resulted in a certain percent increase in traffic at a certain intersection, a complete



                                                           2 of 4
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                               Appendix D



         analysis would be conducted for that intersection. He said this is a typical method used by
         many communities and it is common to use a 10-15 percent threshold in this method.
         Thys Van Cort said it seems that applying this criteria would eliminate many of the
         intersections from analysis. George estimated that it would yield about 30-35 intersections.
         Tim Logue expressed concern about using a percent threshold for volume of traffic. He said
         that percent change in delay also is an important consideration. George said it would be
         difficult to include delay in the criteria because it would essentially require that the analysis
         be conducted in order to determine whether the intersection warranted detailed analysis. Tim
         said he felt it was important to somehow measure change in delay. He noted that the City has
         LOS data available for many of the intersections.
         Thys Van Cort pointed out that many commuters from West Hill are headed to Cornell, but
         there are only a few intersections along the corridors, such as NYS Rt. 96. He said a 15
         percent increase in traffic volume on that corridor would be very detrimental. Ed Marx said
         that a 15 percent threshold really could be translated as a 30 percent increase in traffic
         volume because it would include 15 percent increase in Cornell traffic and 15 percent
         increase in background traffic.
         George said that many jurisdictions have certain threshold guidelines. Jonathan Kanter
         pointed out that there is not a blanket threshold in this area because of a great deal of
         variability. He suggested that a combination of percent volume threshold and LOS could be
         used on certain intersections. A 15 percent volume threshold may be fine for an intersection
         that has good level of service, but a lower threshold may be desirable for an intersection with
         a questionable LOS.
         George Alexiou said there should be some method for reducing the number of intersections to
         be analyzed from the 53 on the initial list. Tim Logue said he is concerned that using the
         criteria George outlined could eliminate analysis of some intersections that are already at a
         LOS level E. Ed Marx noted that close to campus most of the base traffic is Cornell-related,
         and perhaps a different criteria should be applied to intersections close to campus.
         Tim suggested that municipalities determine the LOS for intersections in their jurisdiction
         and that different percent volume thresholds be established for intersections operating at
         different LOS. As an instance, a 15 percent volume threshold might be acceptable for
         intersections operating at a LOS of A or B, but a five percent volume threshold might be
         more appropriate for intersections at LOS E or F.
         It was noted that the NYS Rt. 13 and Triphammer Road intersection should be added to the
         intersection list. Herb Engman also recommended that both one-lane bridges in Forest Home
         be added to the list, and Jonathan Kanter recommended adding the intersection at NYS Rt. 96
         at the hospital.
         Kathryn Wolf said that M/A/B will revise the intersection analysis criteria based on input
         from the Resource Committee. She noted that the intersection list will be presented at public
         scoping and some reasonable criteria is necessary to keep the list from becoming too
         unwieldy.
    5. The Resource Committee discussed the Draft Scope. Tim Logue asked if there is a way to
       provide more geographical data on housing. George asked if he meant housing un-related to
       Cornell. Tim said yes. George said that hosing projections would not be included in this
       study. Ed Marx said that the County is beginning to collect building permit data.
         Jonathan Kanter asked whether the Resource Committee is comfortable with the Draft Scope
         being presented to the Town Planning Board on 11/15. Fernando de Aragón asked if there



                                                           3 of 4
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                             Appendix D



         would be opportunity to make adjustments between the 11/15 Planning Board meeting and
         Public Scoping on 12/6. Jonathan said no. He said the document presented at the 11/15
         Planning Board meeting should be the same one addressed at Public Scoping, and revisions
         could be made following that. Kathryn Wolf pointed out that the Resource Committee
         reviewed the Draft Scope line-by-line at its 10/24 meeting, and the version presented at this
         meeting incorporates comments from that review.
         Bill Egloff suggested that Resource Committee members e-mail any comments to
         Trowbridge & Wolf. Herb Engman asked whether the list of potential intersections would be
         included in the Draft Scope. He said that not all Resource Committee members provided
         input on that list, and he did not feel that it was a Resource Committee list.
         Kathryn Wolf noted that the criteria for determining intersections to be analyzed would be
         included in the Draft Scope. Jonathan suggested including a preliminary list of intersections
         as well. It was agreed that the revised criteria would be distributed to Resource Committee
         members for feedback by the end of the week.
    6. Dwight Mengel asked whether a method would be established to look at transit systems.
       George Alexiou said there may not be a global methodology for examining transit systems,
       but specific analysis may be appropriate in certain areas. Ed Marx pointed out that a high
       number of Cornell employees ride the bus, so the bus system should be able to accommodate
       an increase in Cornell population. Jonathan Kanter recommended that a methodology for
       analyzing transit be included in the Draft Scope.
    7. Herb Engman asked whether bus and six-wheel vehicle traffic (particularly construction
       vehicles) would be analyzed in residential neighborhoods.
    8. Bill Gray pointed out that the information in the t-GEIS will be very useful for all of the
       municipalities in the County. It will be helpful in determining where to make future
       investments and likely will be helpful in finding solutions to many transportation problems.
    9. The meeting was adjourned at 3:15 p.m.

    1. The Resource Committee voted unanimously to accept the minutes from the 10/6/05 meeting.
    2. Kathryn Wolf distributed informational binders to members of the Committee and gave a
       brief review of the process being followed in developing the t-GEIS.
    3. Fernando de Aragón asked whether there were any general comments from members of the
       Committee. There were none.
    4. George Alexiou gave a presentation about the traffic analysis methodology that M/A/B is
       using, and methods being considered to determine background growth. Thys Van Cort asked
       for confirmation that the background growth in this project is only concerned with traffic.
       George said that is the case, but it is important to understand population growth as well.
       Fernando de Aragón asked whether state DOT data was included. George and Nathaniel
       Grier said it is included in Tompkins County data. Thys asked whether background data is
       measuring an increase in commuter trips or an increase in population or both. George said it
       includes both commuter trips and population growth.
         George said that the data collected and analyzed so far indicates that traffic in Tompkins
         County has been growing, on average, about 2.5% annually for the last eight years. Thys
         asked whether that growth rate is a combination of Cornell growth and other growth in the
         community. George confirmed that it is and he said that Cornell growth needs to be
         subtracted out to establish background growth. George pointed out that it is important to
         understand whether historic growth is a good indicator of future growth in the community.
         Thys asked where the population data was derived from. George said it is from the Census
         and Census projections. He said he is aware that Census projections are not always accurate.
         George said that population has grown in Tompkins County by approximately 1% between
         1970 and 2003, and that employment in the County has grown by approximately 2.4% since
         1980, while Cornell employment has grown by approximately 1% since 1980. Herb Engman
         noted that graphing total number of jobs at Cornell compared to the total number of other
         jobs in the County could be misleading since Cornell jobs represent a significant percentage
         of total jobs in the County. He suggested graphing jobs as percentages rather than total
         numbers. Nathaniel Grier noted that percentages could be misleading as well since a 1%



                                                           1 of 3
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                             Appendix D



         increase in jobs in Tompkins County is much more substantial than a 1% increase in jobs at
         Cornell.
         Thys asked whether data would be collected on the number of employees who live in
         Tompkins County versus employees who do not. Jonathan Kanter said that data is available
         in the 2000 Census. Nathaniel Grier pointed out that the objective in this project is to
         establish changes in traffic volume so it is not so important whether commuters live in the
         County or not. Brent Cross said that the recent northeast sewer expansion project may have
         useful, current data.
         Tim Logue said it may be useful to look at household growth, then study the distribution of
         growth throughout the County, to determine where there might be traffic problems. Thys said
         that housing prices have followed employment growth very closely since 1950 and if
         employment growth continues to increase as it has in the last five years it will result in
         unprecedented growth. He speculated that if housing prices continue to increase more
         employees will move out of the County and commute in.
         Thys asked Fernando if the 2.5% growth rate indicated by M/A/B seems reasonable.
         Fernando said it is consistent with national growth rates for traffic.
         George outlined methods being used by M/A/B to determine the impact area and the specific
         intersections that will be important to study in the t-GEIS. Herb Engman said that certain
         neighborhood groups, such as the Forest Home Neighborhood Improvement Association may
         be able to provide traffic data specific to their neighborhoods. Andrew Eastlick said that he
         received traffic data from the Forest Home group and provided it to M/A/B.
         Dan Kwasnowski asked whether type of job is relevant, particularly in relation to Cornell
         employees. Fernando said the Tompkins County/Cornell Employee Commuter Survey may
         yield some data about commuting habits relative to job type. George pointed out that traffic
         analysis for this project will focus on peak hour traffic. Thys and Herb said that there may be
         a relationship between salary and commuting time. Generally those with a higher salary can
         afford to live closer to campus and commute less. Fernando said there also may be data
         regarding this in the commuter survey.
    5. Kathryn Wolf reviewed the SEQR law and SEQR definition of a GEIS. She also reviewed the
       proposed schedule for the project. She said that a discussion of growth scenarios and a
       preliminary list of intersections to be studied will be on the agenda at the 11/7 Resource
       Committee meeting. The t-GEIS will be submitted for an informal review by the Town
       Planning Board at its 11/15 meeting.
    6. The Resource Committee reviewed the Draft Scope. Ed Marx said the introductory
       paragraphs are misleading. The first paragraph indicates that the t-GEIS is being written to
       study potential Cornell growth, but the second paragraph says the proposed action is Ten-year
       Impact Mitigation Strategies (TIMS). Kathryn Wolf said the wording may need to be revised,
       but she clarified that under SEQR law the action must be something that is approvable, which
       is why TIMS is the action. It will be the mitigation strategies that will be approved.
         George added that there will be a range of growth scenarios and a range of mitigations; not a
         single mitigation strategy for each growth scenario. Ed asked who will choose the mitigation
         measures. He said it would not be useful to develop the t-GEIS and then still have to go
         through the SEQR process for all Cornell projects anyway. Kathryn Wolf said that the intent
         is that the t-GEIS will address the transportation impacts of future Cornell projects, and
         provide a better understanding of the overall vision for development at Cornell.

transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                             Appendix D



         Brent Cross asked how the t-GEIS might affect private or municipal projects with regard to
         SEQR. George said it is not the intention to do SEQR for the mitigation projects themselves
         during this project. The intent of this project is to determine how the highest growth scenario
         at Cornell would affect the infrastructure and what might need to be done to mitigate that.
         Ed pointed out that building infrastructure is not an immediate process and that it would need
         to be in place in time to handle an increase in growth at Cornell. Bill Wendt said that is
         exactly why this project is being undertaken.
         Tim Logue asked for clarification that the t-GEIS is focusing only on home to work commute
         trips and not other commuter trips. Bill Wendt noted that it is assumed that if impacts of peak
         hour traffic have been mitigated, off-peak impacts also will have been mitigated.
         Ed and Thys pointed out that it may be necessary to isolate certain areas. Thys said that in
         certain areas on Friday afternoon and mid-day on Saturday traffic is just as heavy as typical
         weekday peak-hour traffic. Jonathan Kanter said it may be useful to identify some corridors
         to be studied in addition to individual intersections. Fernando pointed out that there are some
         very distinct corridors leading to Cornell.
         Herb asked whether traffic mitigation for special events at Cornell should be addressed. Bill
         Wendt pointed out that they already are very well mitigated. JoAnn Cornish agreed, and said
         it would be good to note that in the t-GEIS.
    7. Thys asked whether members of the Resource Committee would be expected to attend the
       Dec. 6 public scoping session. Bill Wendt said Committee members are invited to the public
       scoping but are not required to attend.
    8. The meeting was adjourned at 3:00 p.m.

    1. Cathy Valentino and Bill Wendt welcomed members to the Committee and provided opening
       comments.
    2. All meeting attendees introduced themselves.
    3. The Committee established the schedule for meetings through the end of the year. The next
       meeting will be on October 24, a second meeting will be on November 7 and a third meeting
       will be on December 12. All meetings will begin at 1:00 p.m. and end at 2:30 p.m. in the
       TCAT Board Room.
    4. It was confirmed that Fernando de Aragón will serve as chair of the Committee.
    5. Kathryn Wolf and Andrew Eastlick provided a presentation outlining information about the
       project background, scope and schedule.
    6. Thys Van Cort said he still is unclear about the proposed SEQR Action and asked for further
       clarification. He asked whether the t-GEIS would, as an example, fulfill the SEQR
       requirements for certain future Cornell projects, such as a new parking lot. Kathryn Wolf said
       that the t-GEIS will not fulfill all SEQR requirements for future projects, although it is
       anticipated that the transportation impacts of future projects will have been studied
       generically in the t-GEIS, and that may fulfill most SEQR requirements for traffic-related
       aspects of the project. Specific transportation impacts not covered in the t-GEIS will have to
       be studied in the SEQR analysis for each individual project.
    7. Ed Marx asked whether the t-GEIS will include clear mitigations for incremental amounts of
       campus growth or population increase. George Alexiou said that there is likely to be a menu
       of options, rather than a single proposed mitigation.
    8. Bill Gray noted that the Resource Committee essentially is the MPO Planning Committee,
       but the Town of Ithaca has been proposed as the lead agency. He asked why the MPO was
       not proposed as the lead agency. Bill Wendt and Fernando de Aragón said that the MPO does



                                                           1 of 4
transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                             Appendix D



         not have legal standing in the SEQR process. Bill Wendt explained that Cornell and the Town
         previously had established a Town/Cornell Transportation Committee, which grew into the
         Town Transportation Committee. The Town now is drafting a Town Transportation Plan. He
         said that process made proposing the Town Planning Board as lead agency the next logical
         step for preparation of a Cornell t-GEIS. He and Cathy Valentino noted that the Resource
         Committee is a way to provide comprehensive coordinated review for all involved agencies.
    9. Bill Gray noted that the t-GEIS is likely to become the framework that other Cornell projects
       are "hung" on.
    10. Thys Van Cort noted that, in addition to the lead agency, involved agencies often make
        findings statements on the proposed action or plan during the SEQR process. He asked
        whether the City would be asked to make a findings statement on the t-GEIS when complete.
        Kathryn Wolf said that involved agencies will make a findings statement if/when they
        reference the t-GEIS, either on transportation-related impacts of a future Cornell project, or a
        transportation-related improvement in their own municipality. Jonathan Kanter said it is
        assumed that the Town Planning Board (the proposed lead agency) is the only agency that
        will formally approve the proposed action, Ten-year Impact Mitigation Strategies (TIMS).
        Other involved or interested agencies will have the opportunity to endorse TIMS.
    11. Thys Van Cort pointed out that there is some concern about the proposed lead agency, since
        the lead agency establishes and directs the process. He said his understanding is that involved
        agencies have a legal responsibility to either do findings on the proposed action, or to adopt
        the Town's findings on the proposed action. Jonathan Kanter clarified that involved agencies
        are not required to make findings until they reference the t-GEIS in a project review. He
        noted that some municipalities may never reference the t-GEIS.
    12. JoAnn Cornish noted that the Town Planning Board has only expressed its intent to be lead
        agency, but not all involved/interested agencies have yet concurred.
    13. Bill Wendt and George Alexiou said that the goal of this project is to have all
        involved/interested agencies feel comfortable with and agree with the final product.
    14. Brent Cross asked what happens if a municipality does not reference the t-GEIS in the future.
        Will they have fulfilled their responsibilities as an involved agency? Will they have
        culminated the process?
    15. Thys Van Cort said the process will end when the lead agency adopts its own findings on the
        t-GEIS. Then the involved/interested agencies can make findings on the t-GEIS immediately
        or later when they reference it when reviewing a proposed project.
    16. Herb Engman emphasized that all involved agencies must be clearly listed.
    17. Thys Van Cort asked for confirmation that the Town Planning Board has been proposed as
        lead agency because much of Cornell's future growth is anticipated in the Town. He noted
        that the City has four more days in which to decide whether to concur with the Town
        Planning Board as lead agency. Bill Wendt confirmed that much of Cornell's future growth is
        anticipated in the Town and he pointed out that most of Cornell's parking already exists in
        the Town.
    18. JoAnn Cornish questioned why the County was not proposed as lead agency. Ed Marx noted
        that it is possible that there will never be a Cornell project that falls under the County
        jurisdiction for review and approval.
    19. JoAnn Cornish asked whether SEQR is the right mechanism for this type of project. Bill
        Egloff of DOT pointed out that it is probably the only legal mechanism.

    20. Thys Van Cort and JoAnn Cornish asked why the proposed action is not referred to as a plan.
        Andrew Eastlick said that people who are not planners generally do not understand that a plan
        can be, and often is, a menu of options; not necessarily a single, prescribed plan. He said
        Cornell was concerned that referring to the proposed action as a plan would give the
        inaccurate perception that the final product would be a single prescribed course of action.
    21. Bill Egloff noted that the municipalities in Tompkins County are very fortunate that this
        process is occurring. He said it is rare in most other counties for municipalities to
        communicate and cooperate on issues such as transportation. He urged the group not to let the
        process unravel.
    22. Ed Marx said he thinks of the proposed action as a study of impacts of potential future
        Cornell growth and that mitigation strategies will grow out of that study. Bill Wendt, Cathy
        Valentino and Andrew Eastlick concurred with that understanding.
    23. George Alexiou presented some transportation-related studies and mitigation strategies that
        his firm Martin/Alexiou/Bryson has developed at other universities throughout the country.
    24. Fernando de Aragón suggested that geo-coding include City employees as well as Cornell
        employees, since they use the same roads. He said that data will be available in Phase II of
        the Park & Ride survey, which should be available in December.
    25. Ed Marx said the method used to analyze background growth will be very important, since
        Cornell is a big generator of background growth.
    26. George Alexiou said he will present different examples of methods to determine background
        growth at the next Resource Committee meeting.
    27. Jonathan Kanter asked about proposed Cornell growth scenarios to be studied in the t-GEIS.
        Kathryn Wolf said Cornell is still working on defining them.
    28. Kathryn Wolf said the next step in the process will be for Cornell to further develop the draft
        scope in preparation for public scoping. She said a draft of the draft scope will be mailed to
        members of the Resource Committee for their review prior to the next meeting. Resource
        Committee members will be asked to provide input on the draft scope at the next meeting.
    29. Brent Cross said he still is somewhat unclear about what the final product will be. He noted
        that many Resource Committee members are not quite sure where the process is going, but
        they are all going there together, which is an advantage.
    30. JoAnn Cornish said she anticipates that the draft Scope will help make things more clear
        about the process and the proposed action.


    Post Meeting Notes:
    31. Fernando de Aragón urged participation by the Village of Lansing. (The Village of Lansing is
        the only invited agency that did not accept the invitation to sit on the Resource Committee.)
        Cathy Valentino and Fernando both will follow up with the Village and urge participation on
        the Resource Committee.
    32. Fernando de Aragón recommended that the Disability Advisory Committee be added to the
        Stakeholders List.
    33. Bill Egloff of DOT mentioned to Kathryn Wolf that since federal funding is likely to be
        sought for implementation at some point in time, perhaps the NEPA Environmental Review
        should occur on a parallel track. Fernando thought that NEPA review would be more

         appropriate at the project-specific/implementation phase. Bill Egloff will look into this
         further.

MEMORANDUM
To:             Kathryn Wolf, Trowbridge & Wolf
From:           George Alexiou, PE
Date:           October 31, 2005
Subject:        Cornell University ­ Background Traffic Growth Recommendations

A meeting was held October 25, 2005 in Ithaca to discuss the method by which to establish
background growth for the t-GEIS. Attending the meeting were: Fernando de Aragón (ITCTC),
Ed Marx (Tompkins County Planning), Martha Armstrong (Tompkins County Area
Development), Jonathan Kanter (Town of Ithaca Planning), Mina Amundsen (Cornell
University), Andrew Eastlick (Cornell University), George Alexiou (M/A/B), Kathryn Wolf
(Trowbridge & Wolf) and Annette Marchesseault (Trowbridge & Wolf). This memorandum
reflects direction given to the consultants in large part through input from Fernando, Martha, Ed
and Jonathan as a result of that meeting.

Introduction

This memorandum provides recommendations for an annual background traffic growth rate to
be used for projecting future traffic on streets and intersections in the impact area defined for
the Transportation Focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS) being developed
for Cornell University. The rate is intended to estimate traffic growth that will be generated by
increases in non-Cornell population (including employment) over the next 10 years, and will be
applied to existing traffic count data. Traffic created by the various hypothetical growth
scenarios for Cornell for the next 10 years will be estimated separately, and added to the
background traffic to obtain the total future traffic at specific locations within the impact area.
These locations will be analyzed to determine the relative impact of potential Cornell growth on
traffic conditions.

Historic Traffic Growth

Historic traffic growth is recommended as the basis for projecting future background traffic
growth. At this point in time there is no clear understanding of or consensus on how much
population growth is expected in Tompkins County in the next 10 years. Previous population
projections are currently being updated and may be available around the end of the year.

Traffic counts on roads around the Cornell campus and major approach corridors to the campus
(generally within the Town and City of Ithaca) between 1989 and 2004 were analyzed to
develop a historic growth rate. As all parties have expressed greater confidence in count data
collected by the state, all but two of the locations analyzed were collected by the New York
State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); these two locations filled geographic gaps on
the north and east approaches to the campus. A count was only used if it was clear that it was
collected at an identical location in different years. A total of 17 locations were identified.

                                                                               Traffic Engineers


Average annual growth rates for the above locations were calculated by a variety of methods
(total average, by periods within the 15 years, or by roadway volume). The average of these
methods resulted in an annual, compound growth rate of 2.2%.

It should be noted that this traffic growth rate exceeds the County population and employment
growth rates in the same period, reflecting a national trend of increasing per capita travel (i.e.,
the relationship between population and traffic growth is not linear).

This rate is also consistent with NYSDOT recommendations for projected traffic growth.
Statewide, when no other data is available, NYSDOT assumes a 2% per annum traffic growth
rate. Bill Egloff of NYSDOT also indicated that he felt that while some areas of Tompkins County
may have experienced traffic growth at 1% or less in the past several years, there are several
areas in the County which have experienced traffic growth in excess of 2% per year. When
estimating future growth rates for a specific area, they use the same methodology and type of
analysis as performed above for the roadway system around Cornell.

Therefore, a 2.2% per annum historic traffic growth rate is recommended as the starting point.
This includes all traffic growth over the last 15 years, and the next step is to determine the
contribution of Cornell University growth to this number. The remainder will be defined as the
background growth rate.

Background Traffic Growth Rate

There is no precise method for estimating Cornell's component of the historic traffic growth rate
of 2.2%. Various population and employment statistics were reviewed for this purpose, with the
following key findings:

·   Over the last three decades Cornell's population has consistently comprised just under 30%
    of the County's population.

·   In the same period, Cornell population growth has represented approximately 1/3rd of all the
    population growth in the County. This number has been in steady decline since the 1960's
    when Cornell's growth was approximately 60% of the total county growth to 20% of the total
    growth in the 1990's.

·   Cornell population growth has not always mirrored County growth. For example, between
    1990 and 2000 the County grew slightly while Cornell experienced no growth. However,
    traffic continued to grow in that period.

Therefore it seems reasonable to assume a background traffic growth rate of between 70 and
75% of the historic growth rate, or approximately 1.5% compound per annum.

Two points should be noted regarding this growth rate:

·   Cornell traffic can be expected to be more concentrated around the campus. Therefore, the
    background growth rate may be a little overstated for these locations. Since the traffic
    resulting from the hypothetical growth scenarios for Cornell will be totally accounted for as
    part of the analysis (and added to the background traffic), the overestimation of background
    growth will represent worst-case conditions.

·   There is a relationship between background traffic and Cornell employment growth. The
    Cornell Local Government Program estimates the multiplier effect of Cornell employment at
    0.36 jobs, i.e., every new Cornell employee generates an additional 0.36 jobs in the
    community. Higher Cornell employment growth implies higher background traffic growth.
    Therefore background traffic growth may be underestimated under the high Cornell growth
    scenarios.

Therefore on balance, a 1.5% background traffic growth rate is reasonable.

Susan Brock's comments on the housing memo, July 10, 2006

I'll leave it to the planners to weigh in on the commuting population growth numbers assigned to each
corridor.

The memo doesn't support the conclusion that the current mode split should be maintained for the new
population. If the current ratio of parking permits to population won't increase, why "may" it be "implied"
that some of those living close to campus or within the TCAT service area will switch to an alternative
mode (thereby allowing the new people to grab parking permits in the same ratio as the current people)?
Most of those who live close-in are not new-growth people, since the new growth is occurring further out.
What mechanism will force those who are already here to give up their permits? Maybe mitigation
measures will induce some of them to switch from single occupancy vehicles to something else, but isn't
the purpose of this map to look at impacts from growth before mitigation measures are applied?

I don't know if your plans for this memo include posting it on the website, but if you plan to do that, you
should revise it to state undergrads aren't considered part of the commuting population and explain why.

M/A/B Response to Susan ­ July 13

Susan, as a transportation professional I am comfortable with the mode split assumption we are planning
to use. The main reason is that it does not change the potential traffic impacts on the neighborhoods
surrounding the campus which is one of biggest concerns and focus of this study.

As a reminder, the baseline assumption of the t-GEIS is that the existing mode split of the campus
population remains at current levels. This is because through a combination of existing TDM programs
and control of the parking supply, participation in alternative modes will be maintained at the current
ratio. This is considered the worst case scenario and more aggressive TDM and other mitigations could
potentially reduce further the number of drivers (the objective of the TIMS). Because of this assumption
that the same percentage of the new population drives as does currently, mathematically, if a higher
proportion of new drivers live farther out, then fewer will live closer in. Therefore, we would have to
reduce or even subtract vehicles from the inner roads and add them to the outer roads. The net effect on
the inner roads (i.e., the neighborhoods surrounding and near the campus) would be approximately the
same (at least on average) since the same traffic we moved to the outer areas will still pass through the
inner areas. The major change will be some more traffic on the outer roads, which we have dealt with by
making a worst-case assumption that all new traffic generated in each corridor originates at the outer edge
of the corridor, regardless of where the commuter may actually live in the corridor. In our model they all,
therefore, travel the full length of the corridor, whereas in reality it is a gradient.

It also should be noted that transit now serves parts of theses areas (albeit service is not as good as in the
Town of Ithaca and the City), and is likely to be expanded/improved even without Cornell growth, i.e.,
not as mitigation measure for this study. This will help the mode split.

I also wanted to note that the mode split is an average over the entire region. Therefore, trying to adjust it
(which would be tedious and imprecise anyway) would not substantially change the results.

Mode split is only one of several assumptions we have to make. Where the new people may live is an
even less precise assumption. Other assumptions include which exact streets motorist use to reach campus
and the proportions using each route.

Susan, we are being diligent in selecting our methodologies and making assumptions. We know that
everything we do will be scrutinized and are going to great pains to ensure our work is defensible. Your
(and others) comments and questioning is welcome. Better now than later. The reality is that                 Deleted: (and the public would be

only guess at now. Those involved in transportation accept that. Of course in every transportation study
we could collect more data and do more analysis, but society cannot afford and would not agree to spend
the money needed to get exact answers. And because many of the factors that influence travel (and
housing) decisions are predictions about the future, the effort is not warranted.


Original memo
This memo outlines the methodology and assumptions regarding the distribution of future housing
locations of the Cornell community.

BASE DISTRIBUTION

The base distribution for the future housing growth is the existing condition. Addresses of commuting
faculty, staff and graduate students were obtained and geo-coded (the process by which a street address is
converted to a dot on a map representing that location). Only these populations were mapped since these
are the two groups that may grow under the hypothetical growth scenarios. Typically, the distribution of
the existing commuting population would be considered representative of the distribution of the
population growth anticipated in the hypothetical growth scenarios. As part of the traffic analysis,
Tompkins County (and beyond) was divided up into a number of approach corridors useful for estimating
the traffic impacts of the future growth. Each person for whom an address was obtained and successfully
geo-coded was mapped into the approach corridor containing their place of residence. The percentage of
total commuting population residing in each zone was calculated and shared with the Town, City and
County as the basis for estimating the location of future housing.

INITIAL FEEDBACK

The initial step in the future housing distribution was a joint meeting with local planners including
representatives from the Town of Ithaca, City of Ithaca, Tompkins County, Tompkins County Area
Development, and ITCTC. Each agency shared its knowledge of approved and late-planning stage
housing developments as well as information on long-term initiatives (public and private). General trends
include modest growth in the Downtown (and to a lesser degree Collegetown), with the most concentrated
growth occurring on West Hill and in the Village and Town of Lansing. Additional growth is anticipated
in the west and north parts of the county with more limited growth to the east and south. It was agreed
that these trends are generally reflective of the long-term socio-economic forecasts prepared for the
County and that they should shape future housing location estimates.

PROPOSED DISTRIBUTION

Based on this feedback, an estimate of the future housing locations of the Cornell employee and graduate
population was developed. Primary aspects of this distribution include:
   · Very little of the housing growth will occur within the City of Ithaca or the Village of Cayuga
        Heights. Notable exceptions include the Downtown core and Southwest Area.
   · Additional growth is expected toward the west (Town of Ithaca, Enfield) and northwest (Ulysses
        and Trumansburg). Because of the distance from Cornell and known congestion problems, this

   transportation-focused Generic Environmental Impact Statement (t-GEIS)                                       Appendix F


        growth is not expected to represent as high a percentage of the Cornell population as for housing
        stock as a whole.
    ·   Significant growth is expected to the north in the Village and Town of Lansing. Much of the
        needed infrastructure is in place to accommodate higher densities than much of the county and
        the area is generally convenient to Cornell.
    ·   Areas to the east of campus (Varna, Danby, Dryden, Caroline and beyond) will continue to see
        strong growth because of their proximity and general ease of access to campus. These areas (as
        well as Enfield to the west) offer a rural or semi-rural experience, which is seen as a positive,
        lower prices and taxes than the City or Town and the option of being in the Ithaca school district
        (Trumansburg and Lansing are the other desirable school districts). The local shopping malls are
        not that far off from the area but still need to be reached by car. Also, some of these areas already
        have established communities of faculty and staff and graduate students.
    ·   The remainder of the county will see growth more or less proportional to the percentage of the
        Cornell population currently residing there.

The attached map shows the allocation of current driving commuters for each approach corridor, based on
the current housing distribution of those drivers who have a Cornell parking permit. Also shown is the
allocation of the future Cornell hypothetical growth for each approach corridor, based on where future
housing is expected to be built as discussed above. The latter allocation will be used for assigning trips
associated with the growth to the road system.

MODE SPLIT IMPLICATIONS

Because new housing will tend to be located farther from campus than the current housing distribution,
new Cornell persons will have less opportunity to use transit, bike, or walk. Therefore, the proportion of
new Cornell persons who have no choice but to drive could increase.

An explicit assumption of this study is that the ratio of parking permits to population will not increase.
The maximum parking scenario maintains the current ratio of permits to employees/graduate students.
Therefore, the proportion of people driving (or the drive-alone mode split) will not increase. This may
imply that a reduced proportion of those persons living closer to campus or within the TCAT service area
will be able to obtain a permit, and must switch to an alternative mode.

However, as the new driving commuters will likely live farther from the campus, they will travel longer
distances and use more of the road system that is being analyzed for the t-GEIS. This is accounted for in
the study in two ways. First, allocating more of the hypothetical growth farther out explicitly increases
the driving distances. Second, in assigning new trips to the road system, it has been assumed that all trips
generated in an approach corridor originate at the outer edge of the corridor, regardless of where the
commuter may actually live in the corridor, and therefore travel the whole length of the corridor.

It is therefore recommended that the current mode split be maintained for the new population.

    Estimating Vehicular Trip Distribution for Future Hypothetical Cornell Population

    The following diagrams in Appendix G show the new traffic attributed to hypothetical
    future Cornell population assumed along each roadway in the peak hour and, at
    intersections, how it splits or combines en route, for Scenarios 2, 3, and 4. Since Scenario 1
    is background traffic growth only (no new Cornell population growth) no estimates were
    provided for Scenario 1. In some instances, the numbers may not sum precisely because of
    rounding. Additionally, because vehicles were assumed to enter/leave the main roads into
    neighborhoods and residences some volumes may change between intersections. The
    following methodology was used to estimate the new traffic.

    A total number of new vehicle trips that could be attributed to future hypothetical Cornell
    population was estimated for Scenarios 2, 3, and 4. For each of these hypothetical growth
    scenarios these new vehicle trips were distributed to the approach corridors based on
    estimates of the residence locations of this population. Additionally, for each scenario, the
    distribution of parking on campus was estimated. The following figures summarize the
    process of connecting the trips from the home origins to the campus (and back again). For
    each scenario, the paths from a given approach corridor to a given destination or traffic
    analysis zone (TAZ) on campus were estimated using local knowledge and professional
    judgment supplemented with traffic count data where available. In some cases there might
    be one logical path between an origin and destination while for others there might be
    several. For every possible combination, these trips were tracked from origin to campus (or
    campus to home in the p.m.) and summed along all of the roadway corridors. For a
    complete description of the trip generation and distribution assumptions and methodology,
    refer to section 4.2.4.

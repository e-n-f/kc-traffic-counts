                                Executive Summary
Project Description

PHA Transportation Consultants (PHA) has prepared this traffic report for EBMUD (East Bay
Municipal Utility District) to evaluate the potential traffic impact of replacing its existing 12
million gallons per day (mgd) Diablo Vista Pumping Plant located at 3305 Mt. Diablo Boulevard
with a new 16 mgd pumping plant at the southwest corner of Mt. Diablo Boulevard and Mt.
Diablo Court. The new pumping plant, as with the current facility, will be operated remotely by
EBMUD staff and will not generate vehicle or pedestrian traffic. The focus of the traffic study is
to evaluate the potential traffic impact during the construction period when underground
water pipelines are being installed, construction relocation of an existing storm drain, the
construction of the new Diablo Vista Pumping Plant, and the demolition of the existing Diablo
Vista Pumping Plant.

WRECO, in collaboration with EBMUD, developed four separate construction stages for the
water pipeline construction installation work, which would have the most impact on traffic.
Stage 1 (see Figure 4) will close a small section of the right lane in the eastbound direction.
Stage 2 (see Figure 5) would close the left-lane at the same location. This would leave one
travel lane in the eastbound direction and two travel lanes in the westbound direction. Stage 3
(see Figure 6) would close two westbound lanes from the new pumping plant to the middle of
the Lafayette Cemetery. Stage 4 (see Figure 7) would close two westbound lanes from the
middle of the Lafayette Cemetery to about 200 feet northwest from the Lafayette Park Hotel
entrance. EBMUD estimated 16 construction workers would report to the work site daily. A
total of 54 vehicles, which includes 32 construction worker vehicles (i.e. 16 construction
workers entering and exiting the site) and 22 construction trucks delivering pipes and other
materials, would visit the site on a daily basis. The maximum hourly traffic would be 16 worker
trips and 6 truck trips. The pipeline installation is expected to be completed in approximately
one month.

The construction traffic impacts related to the other project phases (e.g. storm drain relocation,
new pumping plant construction, and existing pumping plant demolition) were also evaluated
as part of this traffic study. The water pipeline construction installation phase has the greatest
potential impacts to traffic and is the main focus of this traffic study.

PHA's traffic analysis for the water pipeline installation phase is based on preliminary
construction vehicle trip estimates provided by EBMUD. EBMUD later revised and
subsequently lowered the construction vehicle trip information as the construction activities
and the associated construction vehicles trips for each phase were better defined. Since the
LOS along the study corridor did not degrade based on the higher preliminary truck trips, PHA
did not redo the traffic analysis calculations at the lower construction vehicle trip estimate. All
construction vehicle trip estimates discussed throughout the report are based on EBMUD's
updated construction vehicle trip estimate for the water pipeline installation phase. Table 6 of

the Detailed Project Trip Generation By Construction Phases section of the Technical
Appendices details EBMUD's initial construction vehicle trip estimates. Tables 1 ­ 5 of the same
section details the construction vehicle trip estimates for the other project phases.

Potential Traffic Impacts

PHA evaluated traffic operations for three intersections along Mt. Diablo Boulevard at Carol
Lane, the Lafayette Park Hotel, and Mt. Diablo Court to assess the potential traffic impact
during construction. The study focuses on intersection delays, lane capacity (at closure),
merge area delays, and impact on public transit, pedestrians and bicyclists. Additionally,
PHA also evaluated project impacts based on the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) guidelines and criteria that will be used in the Mitigated Negative Declaration
(MND) being prepared by EBMUD.

The study results indicated that the project would have minimal impact on study intersection
operations. All three study intersections currently operate at Level-of-Service (LOS) A for a.m.
and p.m. peak hour and will remain so during construction. With lane closures, the remaining
open traffic lanes have adequate capacity to accommodate the total current level of traffic
demand and volume along that segment of Mt. Diablo Boulevard. Delays at the merge areas
will range between two and four seconds.

The study also found that construction activities would affect on-street parking, public transit,
pedestrians and bicyclists. Based on the CEQA guidelines, construction activities and lane
closure could present a hazard to motorists, but will be a "Less Than Significant Impact" with
mitigation.

Recommended Mitigation

PHA recommends the following mitigation measures to minimize the potential project
impact during construction:

   1. Prepare and submit traffic control plans with adequate guide signs for City of Lafayette
      staff review and approval prior to beginning construction.
   2. Review and adjust traffic signal operations at the hotel entrance as needed; signal
      heads in front of Lafayette Park Hotel should be turned off or covered during water
      pipeline construction installation stage 4. Traffic control with flaggers at hotel entrance
      to control traffic flow in and out of hotel is recommended during stage 4.
   3. Contact the public transit operator regarding the lane closure and determine whether
      the temporary relocation of bus stops is required. The bus stop in front of the Lafayette
      Cemetery in the eastbound direction could potentially be impacted.
   4. Accommodate bicyclists during construction. Bicyclists will be redirected to the other
      side of the street and will be required to walk their bike on the sidewalk to avoid
      construction activity.

   5. Maintain a 5 foot wide pedestrian path on either the north or south side of Mt. Diablo
      Boulevard to accommodate pedestrians.
   6. During water pipeline construction stage 4, parking spaces on the north side of the Mt.
      Diablo Boulevard near Lafayette Park Hotel will be inaccessible. Those who park there,
      most likely hotel workers, will have to find parking elsewhere along Mt. Diablo
      Boulevard west of Carol Lane or further east near the overpass near Mt. Diablo Court.
      The City of Lafayette may consider removing the four-hour restrictions temporarily to
      accommodate hotel workers during stage 4 construction, which is expected to last
      about a week.

Details of the potential impact and mitigation are discussed in Chapter 5 of this study.

Alternative Truck Route Access

At the request of the City of Lafayette, an alternative truck route access utilizing westbound Mt.
Diablo Boulevard to the proposed pumping plant site was evaluated. Trucks would potentially
make a left-turn mid-block just west of Mt. Diablo Court near the Lafayette Cemetery into the
proposed site.

Upon review it was determined that the more prudent truck route would be to utilize the left-
turn pocket at Mt. Diablo Court for the following reasons:

   1. There is no left-turn pocket at the proposed turning location which would impact traffic
      flow and obstruct traffic movements in the westbound direction along Mt. Diablo
      Boulevard. Having the construction trucks make a left turn without a turning pocket
      would increase the risk of rear end collisions.

   2. Turning movement at the proposed location into the pump site will be slower as
      opposed to making the turn into Mt. Diablo Court. This would impact traffic in the
      eastbound direction on Mt. Diablo Boulevard and potentially become a safety issue.

                                    1.      Introduction
1.1 Project Description
PHA Transportation Consultants has prepared this traffic operation analysis to evaluate the
potential traffic impact associated with the proposed upgrade and replacement of EBMUD's
Diablo Vista Pumping Plant located in the City of Lafayette. This study will provide the technical
information needed to evaluate and mitigate traffic impacts for the MND being prepared by
EBMUD, pursuant to the requirements of CEQA.

EBMUD plans to replace the existing 12 mgd Diablo Vista Pumping Plant located at 3305 Mt.
Diablo Boulevard with a new 16 mgd pumping plant at the southwest corner of Mt. Diablo
Boulevard and Mt. Diablo Court. EBMUD will also relocate the Leland Rate Control Station to the
new site as part of the project. Access to and from the facility would be from Mt. Diablo Court.
There will be a paved area for parking in front of the facility to accommodate periodic visits
from EBMUD operations and maintenance staff.

The project will involve installing approximately 150 feet of new 30-inch suction pipeline from
the new pumping plant to connect to an existing 30-inch pipeline on the north side of Mt.
Diablo Boulevard. Approximately 130 feet of parallel 30-inch pipeline will also be installed from
the existing 30-inch pipeline on the north side of Mt. Diablo Boulevard to the new Leland Rate
Control Station that will be below grade and adjacent to the new Diablo Vista Pumping Plant.
Additionally, approximately 1,070 feet of 30-inch discharge pipeline will be installed to connect
the new Diablo Vista Pumping Plant to an existing 20-inch pipeline on the north side of Mt.
Diablo Boulevard, about 200 feet northwest from the Lafayette Park Hotel entrance. The
pipelines will be installed using an open trench construction method; the majority of which will
be installed under the far right lane of the westbound traffic on the north side of Mt. Diablo
Boulevard. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the new Diablo Vista Pumping Plant site and the pipeline
installations associated with the project.

Prior to the construction of the new pumping plant, the project will also require the relocation
of an existing 30-inch Reinforced Concrete Pipe (RCP) Storm Drain (SD) located at the new
pumping plant project site. The 30-inch RCP SD will be replaced and relocated with
approximately 240-feet of 24-inch High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) SD on the south side of Mt.
Diablo Blvd and approximately 200 feet of 18-inch HDPE SD will be installed in the west side of
Mt. Diablo Court. Two new SD manholes and two drop inlets will also be installed as part of the
storm drain relocation work. Figure 3 illustrates the storm drain relocations associated with the
project.

Once the new pumping plant construction is completed, the project will not generate new
vehicle or pedestrian traffic. The current pumping plant has no employees and is remotely
operated by EBMUD. The proposed plant at the new location will be operated in the same
manner. EBMUD estimates that the project will be completed in approximately 18 months to

two years. The pipeline installation portion of the project, which involves partial lane closure at
various stages, would be completed in approximately one month. The focus of the study is to
evaluate traffic operations associated with lane closures at various construction stages related
to the water pipeline installations and storm drain relocations. Upon construction completion of
the New Diablo Vista Pumping Plant and all associated water pipeline installations, the existing
Diablo Vista Pumping Plant will be demolished. Traffic impacts related to increase in
construction traffic for the new pumping plant construction and demolition of the existing
pumping plant are also evaluated as part of this study.

1.2 Scope of Study

The study scope of work was designed to identify the traffic operational characteristics during
pipeline installation, new pumping plant construction, and demo of existing pumping plant. The
study specifically evaluates peak hour traffic operational LOS for three key intersections near the
project site. The study also examines parking conditions along Mt. Diablo Boulevard between
Carol Lane and Mt. Diablo Court, roadway capacities and traffic merge areas at construction
zones.

Two traffic scenarios, existing conditions and project conditions were evaluated in the study.
Below is the list of study intersections and scenarios.

                            2. Study Area Description
2.1 Land Use

Land use in the study corridor along Mt. Diablo Boulevard between Carol Lane and Mt. Diablo
Court is a mixture of commercial, freeway and undeveloped land. East of Carol Lane, on the
south side of the street between Carol Lane and the Mt. Diablo Court, there is a hardware store,
auto repair shops, a small office building, the Lafayette Park Hotel, and the Lafayette Cemetery.
Land use on the north side of the street is the freeway State Route (SR) 24.

2.2 Street Network and Access

The street network providing access and circulation to the area and the project site consists
of Mt. Diablo Boulevard, Carol Lane, and Mt. Diablo Court. Below is a brief description of these
streets.

Mt. Diablo Boulevard: Mt. Diablo Boulevard is a major east-west arterial street in the City of
Lafayette. It runs parallel to SR 24 between Acalanes Road in the west and Pleasant Hill Road in
the east providing access to the downtown commercial area, SR 24, and various residential
areas in the City of Lafayette.

The street has two travel lanes in each direction; the posted speed limit along in the study
corridor between Carol Lane and Mt. Diablo Court is 35 mph. Parking is permitted on both sides
of the street between Carol Lane and Pleasant Hill Road, except for parking along the frontage
section of the Lafayette Cemetery to Mt. Diablo Court which is restricted. Parking on the north
side of Mt. Diablo Boulevard between Carol lane and Pleasant Hill Road is prohibited between 3
a.m. and 6 a.m.. On the south side of the street, parking is restricted to 30 minutes in front of
the hardware store and four hours for the four marked parking spaces in front of the Lafayette
Park Hotel. On-street parking is permitted along both sides of Mt. Diablo Boulevard west of
Carol Lane with a four-hour restriction.

The average daily vehicle traffic volume counts collected in April 2012 along Mt. Diablo
Boulevard at a point west of Carol lane is approximately 16,300 vehicles per day (vpd). The
average daily vehicle traffic volume count east of Mt. Diablo Court is 14,260 vpd.

Carol Lane: Carol Lane is a two-lane collector street providing north-south access between
residential areas in the south to Mt. Diablo Boulevard. Parking, with a two-hour restriction, is
permitted on both sides of the street between Mt. Diablo Boulevard and Marlene Drive. The
posted speed limit is 25 mph. The average daily vehicle traffic volume count collected at a point
south of Mt. Diablo Boulevard is 3,600 vpd.

                                                                        PHA Transportation Consultants 12-05-359
                                                                                                   October 2012


Mt. Diablo Court: Mt. Diablo Court is a 400-foot length dead-end cul-de-sac running in a north-
south orientation, providing access to commercial establishments and multi-family complexes.
The average daily traffic volume count collected in April 2012 at a point south of Mt. Diablo
Boulevard is 690 vpd. Parking is permitted on both sides of the street with two-hour and four-
hour restrictions at various locations along the street. The posted speed along Mt. Diablo
Boulevard is 35 mile per hour.

2.3 Transit Service

The County Connection (Central Contra Costa Transportation Authority) provides public transit
service between Lafayette BART Station and Walnut Creek BART Station via Mt. Diablo
Boulevard. From Lafayette BART Station service begins at 7:30 a.m., continues at 30-minite
intervals, and ends at about 7:00 p.m. at Walnut Creek BART Station. From Walnut Creek BART
Station, service begins at 8:00 a.m., continues at hourly intervals, and ends at Lafayette BART
Station at about 6:30 p.m. There are bus stops within the Mt. Diablo Boulevard study corridor
near Mt. Diablo Court, Lafayette Park Hotel, and Carol Lane. There are two bus-stops that could
be impacted by construction; one in front of the Lafayette Hotel and another near Mt. Diablo
Court may need to be temporarily relocated during construction.

2.4 Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities

Pedestrian sidewalks are provided on both sides of Mt. Diablo Boulevard within the study
corridor, except for sections on the south side of the street between the hardware store and
the office building west of the Lafayette Park Hotel, and between the frontage of the cemetery
and Mt. Diablo Court. The City of Lafayette Bicycle Master Plan shows that Mt. Diablo Boulevard
is a Class II Bike Lane. By definition, a Class II Bike Lane provides a dedicated striped, signed and
stenciled lane for one-way travel on a street. Bike lane width generally ranges between 4 and 5
feet wide. Field observation revealed that the bike lane on Mt. Diablo Boulevard between Carol
Lane and Pleasant Hill Road is shared with a parking lane except for the section between the
cemetery frontage and Mt. Diablo Court.

Field observation also noted that some pedestrian activity occurs near the intersection of Mt.
Diablo Boulevard and Carol Lane. This activity is largely due to visitors and patrons to the nearby
business establishments. There are limited pedestrian and bicycle activities east of the hotel;
these activities are mostly associated with dog walkers, recreational strollers, and motorists
who parked on the north side of Mt. Diablo Boulevard.

            3. Current Traffic Operations and Potential Impact
3.1 Study Approach and Assumptions

As discussed above, the new pumping plant will be operated remotely and will not generate
regular vehicle or pedestrian traffic to the site. Therefore, the traffic analysis focuses on the
traffic operational levels along the study corridor during the pipeline installation when sections
of the traffic lanes will be closed, and with the effects of increased traffic associated with the
addition of construction workers and construction truck traffic.

Construction Staging

WRECO, in collaboration with EBMUD on this project, has developed four separate stages to
complete the installation of the water pipelines along Mt. Diablo Boulevard. Stage 1 will close a
small section of the right lane in the eastbound direction on Mt. Diablo Boulevard at a location
about 50 feet west of Mt. Diablo Court, leaving one left lane for travel in the eastbound
direction. The closed area will be about 80 to 100 feet wide and work is expected to be
completed in approximately one week. Stage 2 will close the left lane on Mt. Diablo Boulevard
at the same location, leaving the right lane open for travel in the eastbound direction. Work on
this section is expected to be completed in about one week. Stage 3 will close a section of the
two westbound lanes on Mt. Diablo Boulevard between the new Diablo Vista Pumping Plant to
about halfway to the Lafayette Cemetery entrance. Vehicle traffic from both the east and west
directions would be directed to use the two eastbound lanes. Work on this section is expected
to be completed in about 1 week. Stage 4 will close a section of the two westbound lanes on
Mt. Diablo Boulevard further west to a point past the Park Lafayette Hotel entrance. Traffic
from both directions will be directed to use the two eastbound lanes. Work on this section is
expected to be completed in about one week. Figures 4 through 7 illustrate the four stages of
pipeline installation and the associated lane closures.

WRECO, in collaboration with EBMUD on this project, also developed two separate stages to
complete the storm drain replacement and relocation work on the south side of Mt. Diablo
Boulevard and on the west side of Mt. Diablo Court. Stage 1 will close a small section of the
right lane in the eastbound direction of Mt. Diablo Boulevard near the intersection of Mt. Diablo
Court, leaving one left lane for travel in the eastbound direction. The work is expected to be
completed in approximately one week. Stage 2, which is the installation of the storm drain on
the west side of Mt. Diablo Court, will leave both lanes in Mt. Diablo Court open. Work on this
section is expected to be completed in about one week. Figures 8 and 9 illustrate the two stages
of storm drain relocation work.

Trip Generation and Distribution Estimates

The pipeline installation phase of the project will have the greatest impact on traffic. On a daily
basis during the pipeline installation phase, a total of 16 workers would be working on the site
along with 22 trucks. The maximum hourly (peak hour) estimate is 16 workers and 6 trucks. For
the traffic analysis, each truck is converted to two passenger car equivalents. Table 1 shows the
estimated construction trips for the project. For the purpose of this study, it is assumed that
workers will make one inbound trip to the site in the morning and make one outbound trip
leaving the site in the afternoon after work. Trucks are assumed to be bringing in pipes and
other materials and would leave the work site within the same hour. A total of 54 vehicles,
which includes 32 worker vehicles (i.e. 16 construction workers entering and exiting the site)
and 22 construction trucks would visit the site on a daily basis. It is also assumed that about 70
percent of the construction related traffic will come in by way of SR 24 via the Pleasant Hill Road
interchange and 30 percent via the First Street interchange. Trucks are restricted from making
U-turns at Mt. Diablo Boulevard and are assumed to enter the work site from the east and exit
to the west or vice versa.

    Numbers in parenthesis are Passenger Car Equivalents (PCE). A Passenger Car Equivalent is a metric used in
    Transportation Engineering to assess traffic-flow rate on a roadway. A Passenger Car Equivalent is essentially the
    impact that a mode of transport has on traffic variables (such as headway, speed, density) compared to a single
    vehicle car.

       Trucks entering and exiting the site are considered as one combined trip since trucks are assumed to
    enter the construction area from one direction and exit in another direction. The traffic LOS analysis is
    based on preliminary construction vehicle trip estimates provided by EBMUD. EBMUD later revised and
    subsequently lowered the construction vehicle trip information as the construction activities and the
    associated construction vehicles trips for each phase were better defined. Since the LOS along the study
    corridor did not degrade based on the higher preliminary truck trips, the traffic analysis calculations at the
    lower construction vehicle trip estimate was not redone. All construction vehicle trip estimates discussed
    throughout the report are based on EBMUD's updated construction vehicle trip estimate for the water
    pipeline installation phase. Table 6 of the Detailed Project Trip Generation By Construction Phases section of
    the Technical Appendices details EBMUD's initial construction vehicle trip estimates. Tables 1 ­ 5 of the
    same section details the construction vehicle trip estimates for the other project phases.


3.2 Traffic Operation Evaluation Methodology and Criteria

To identify the potential traffic impact during the water pipeline installation and storm drain
relocation, PHA first evaluated traffic operations under the current condition to establish a
baseline, and then evaluated for conditions under each of the four construction stages. The
study examined key traffic operation Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) such as intersection
delays, lane capacity, and merge area delays at the construction zone. The study also reviewed
construction impacts on on-street parking, public transit, pedestrians and bicyclists along the
study corridor.

Traffic operation analyses for the study corridor were evaluated with methodologies and
procedures prescribed in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) and the SYNCHRO and
SIMTRAFFIC computer software package. Both are industry standards and are widely used by
traffic engineering and transportation planning professionals.

The HCM method evaluates traffic operations based on traffic volumes, roadway configurations
and capacities, traffic control types, and speeds and subsequently ranks the operation with a
letter grades to signify the quality of traffic flows, or the Level-of-Service (LOS). The LOS A
ranking represents free flow conditions with little traffic delays while LOS F represents jammed
conditions with excessive traffic delays. Table 2 shows the LOS rankings and their relationships
to traffic conditions. For signalized intersections, the LOS was evaluated and ranked based on

average delays for vehicles from all approaches and turning movements. For non-signalized side
street stop control intersections such as the Mt. Diablo Boulevard/Mt. Diablo Court intersection,
LOS was evaluated independently, by lane groups instead of the entire intersection and
estimate delays for the approaches that are controlled by stop signs, and the left-turn
movements from the major street.

Through movements on major streets are not evaluated because they normally would operate
at LOS A as they are not faced with traffic control devices nor need to yield to traffic from other
directions.

The City of Lafayette General Plan Policy considers LOS D with a delay of 55 seconds the lowest
acceptable condition for signalized intersections outside of the downtown area, and LOS E for
non-signalized intersections (stop sign control approaches, and/or left-turn movements) with
delays over 50 seconds the minimum acceptable condition. Mt. Diablo Boulevard is not a "Route
of Regional Significance" (arterial streets that run through more than one local jurisdiction) and
as such Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA) which is also the congestion management
agency for Contra Costa County, has no LOS standard or policy for the boulevard.

3.3 Existing Conditions Traffic Operations

PHA evaluated the current study corridor traffic operation with traffic count data collected from
the field in mid June 2012 while schools were out of session. Traffic counts for the morning peak
hour were adjusted upward by about 15 percent based on a comparison with counts collected
while schools were in session. Afternoon peak hour counts were not adjusted since there were
no significant changes compared with counts collected during school days.

Intersection analysis results indicated that the two signalized intersection along Mt. Diablo
Boulevard at Carol Lane and at the Lafayette Park Hotel operated at LOS A for both a.m. and
p.m. peak hours with delays below 10 seconds. For the non-signalized intersection at Mt. Diablo
Court, through traffic including the left-turn movement operated at LOS A while traffic from Mt.
Diablo Court (minor approach) operated at LOS B for a.m. and LOS C for p.m. These are good
service levels and are consistent with field observation. PHA also examined the left-turn lane in
the westbound direction west of the Lafayette Park Hotel entrance. Traffic count data indicated
only 2 and 19 vehicles making left-turns during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, respectively.
Traffic at this location is not expected to operate at a level worse than LOS B.

3.4 Project Impact on Traffic Operation during Construction

PHA evaluated the study corridor traffic operation with the added construction crew and truck
trips, while assuming lane closures at various sections of Mt. Diablo Boulevard at various
construction stages. The traffic operation evaluation also included other key traffic operation
MOEs such as lane capacity and merge area analysis. Tables 3 through 5 illustrate traffic LOS
analyses for intersection operations, lane capacities and merge areas delays. Figures 7 and 8
illustrate current peak hour study intersection traffic volumes and construction worker and
truck trips.

Intersection LOS Analysis

Intersection LOS analysis results indicated that all of the three study intersections, during
various stages of construction, would operate at the same service levels as with the current
condition. This means the construction activities would have minimal impacts on intersection
operations.

Lane Capacity Analysis

Lane capacity analysis results indicated that the one-lane section at various construction stages
would operate adequately at LOS A with volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios below 0.5, indicating
closing off one lane during construction would not create a capacity problem. Lane capacity
analysis is conducted simply by dividing the peak hour vehicle volume with the hourly lane
capacity. The default hourly lane capacity used in the calculation was 1,900 vehicles.

Merge Analysis

Merge analysis results conducted using SIMTRAFFIC, a traffic simulation software application,
indicated that all merges at various stages of construction will operate at good service levels
(LOS A) with delays ranging between 2 and 4 seconds. This means motorists would experience
minimal delay merging from two lanes into one.

Summary

In summary, results of the above key traffic operational MOEs are consistent with one another;
all indicating that construction will have minimal impacts on the study corridor traffic flow. PHA
also examined vehicle queuing conditions as part of the study intersection analysis. Results
revealed that the longest vehicle queues (95th percentile) would be about 8 vehicles deep at any
of the study intersection approaches and turn lanes. Vehicle queues would not block upstream
traffic. The construction period for the water pipeline installation is expected to take
approximately one month.

3.5 Potential Impact on Parking

PHA conducted a parking accumulation survey in mid June 2012 for the study corridor to
examine current parking conditions and to evaluate the potential impact of the construction
activities. Parked vehicles along both sides of Mt. Diablo Boulevard between Carol Lane and the
overpass east of Mt. Diablo Court were counted hourly during the morning, mid day, and
afternoon peak periods to identify parking space availability, levels of utilization, and peaking
characteristics.

On-street parking is permitted along the corridor, but parking spaces are not striped. Parking is
not permitted on the south side of the street between the Lafayette Cemetery frontage and Mt.
Diablo Court, and between the hardware store and the office building west of the Lafayette
Park Hotel entrance. Based on measurements of the curb lengths and assuming a standard
parking space of 20 feet long, the corridor has the capacity to accommodate a total of 97 cars
(76 on the north side of the street and 21 cars on the south side).

Survey results indicated that the average parking occupancy was about 30 percent for the entire
corridor. On an hourly basis, the maximum occupancy was 83 percent, recorded along the
segment between Carol Lane and the Lafayette Park Hotel on the north side of the street.
Survey results indicated that the section between Carol Lane and the Lafayette Park Hotel on
the north side of the street is the most utilized due to its proximity to nearby commercial
activities.

Construction is not expected to have a noticeable impact on parking during Stage 1 and 2 as
construction activities would be limited to the south side of the street in front the new pumping
plant site and the Lafayette Cemetery where parking is not permitted. During construction
stages 3 and 4, however, when the westbound lanes are closed, vehicles will be unable to park

on the north side, particularly the area across from the Lafayette Park Hotel. Parking impacts
will be moderate and coordination should be done with the Lafayette Park Hotel to minimize
impacts to their scheduled events. Table 9 shows a summary of current on-street parking
conditions along the study corridor.

  Note: Parking capacity for the north side of the street is estimated based on curb length minus landscape planter areas, divided by 20 feet (standard parking space length).
  Capacity for the south side is estimated based on actual count of the marked spaces and estimate of the available curb length. Between Carol Lane. and the hotel entrance,
  there is a green curb in front of the hardware store measuring about 100 feet long that can accommodate 5 vehicles, plus two marked spaces west of the hotel entrance. The
  area in front of the current pump station, auto repair shop, and the office building are not included in the analysis since they are not curb-parking. Average occupancy= total
  parked car/9 hours/capacity. Maximum occupancy=highest hourly parked car/capacity.

3.6 Potential Impact on Public Transits

As discussed above, County Connection runs the Route 25 transit bus between Lafayette BART
Station and Walnut Creek BART Station via Mt. Diablo Boulevard. There are bus stops along the
study corridor on both sides of the street. The bus stops near Carol Lane would not likely be
affected. The other bus-stops in front of the Lafayette Park hotel and near Mt. Diablo Court may
be affected and may need to be temporarily relocated during construction.

3.7 Potential Impact on Pedestrians and Bicyclists
PHA collected pedestrian and bicycle counts while conducting traffic counts for the corridor.
Count data and field observation revealed most pedestrian activities in the area occurred near
the Mt. Diablo Boulevard/Carol Lane intersection. Only a handful of pedestrians (fewer than 20),
mostly dog walkers and recreational strollers, and bicyclists were observed walking or biking
along Mt. Diablo Boulevard east of the Lafayette Park Hotel. Construction activities would likely
affect pedestrians and bicyclists when lanes and sidewalks are closed. Construction signs will be
installed to direct pedestrians and bicyclists to other side of the street opposite construction
activity.

      bicycle racks)?


As indicated in the above table, the project would have no impact on criterion b, c, and f;
however, it would increase roadway hazards (a, d and e) during construction to install pipelines.
However, these can be reduced to less than significant with mitigation.

                                          5. Mitigation
PHA has identified potential project impacts in Chapters 3 and 4. Below is a list of potential impacts and
recommended mitigation measures.

5.1 Potential Impact and Mitigation

4a. Less than Significant with Mitigations. The project would generate vehicle trips during
project construction, temporarily contributing to increased traffic on local roadways. Truck trips
would be associated with hauling materials, trench spoils and equipment to and from the
project site. Construction employees would also contribute to vehicle trips. The addition of
traffic during project construction would not degrade traffic operation along the study corridor.
However, lane closures during construction would affect pedestrians and bicyclists.
Implementation of Mitigation Measure TRAF-1 identified below will lessen potential impacts to
a Less-than-Significant level.

    ·   Limit construction trucks to ten or less through Mt. Diablo Boulevard during the peak
        hour period (7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.). EBMUD construction
        inspectors shall enforce these vehicle limits. With implementation of this measure, the
        impact would be reduced to Less-than-Significant. Construction and haul trucks will be
        directed to use the Pleasant Hill Road interchange to access the work site.

4b. No Impact: The project and its construction would not conflict with Contra Costa County
Congestion Management Policy and LOS standards. All three intersections and roadway
segments along the study corridor would operate at LOS A with or without the project and its
constructions activities

4c. No Impact. The project would not affect air traffic and no impacts related to air traffic or
safety.

4d. Less than Significant with Mitigations. The project would not result in any permanent
changes to existing traffic design features, but traffic hazards related to truck traffic and lane
closure along the project route would increase. Contract specifications would require
implementation of a traffic safety plan (including flaggers) during the construction period.
Implementation of Mitigation Measure TRAF-2 identified below will lessen potential impacts to
a Less-than-Significant level. EBMUD contract specifications shall require the preparation and
implementation of a Traffic Management Plan, which shall include the following elements:
    ·   The work hours for each phase of project construction, the process for notifying
        residents and businesses of construction activity, and the means for people to report
        construction-related problems.

    ·   Traffic control plans showing typical work areas for each phase of construction along
                                                    33
                                                       Diablo Vista Pumping Plant Replacement Traffic Study
                                                                   PHA Transportation Consultants 12-05-359
                                                                                              October 2012


       with details for partial and full road closures, detours, and construction area signage.
       The plans should indicate a minimum roadway width to maintain for emergency vehicle
       access through the site. The plans will include temporary "Share The Road" signage
       adjacent to work zones when construction is taking place on Mt. Diablo Boulevard to
       alert vehicles to the presence of bicycles using this Class II bicycle route.

   ·   Procedures for notifying emergency services of full roadway closures and detours.
   ·   Flaggers at the construction site to direct construction vehicles and control traffic as
       needed.

   ·   Flaggers at the Mt. Diablo Boulevard/Lafayette Hotel driveway intersection during
       construction stage 4.
   ·   Documentation of road pavement conditions for all routes that would be used by
       construction vehicles both before and after Project construction. Roads found to have
       been damaged by construction vehicles shall be repaired to the level at which they
       existed prior to project construction.

4e. Less than Significant with Mitigations: The project would not impact emergency access
because contract specifications will require the contractor to maintain emergency roadway
access at all times. Implementation of Mitigation Measure TRAF-2 identified above will lessen
potential impacts to a Less-than-Significant level.

4f. No Impact: Post construction, and during normal operations, the project would not generate
vehicle and pedestrian trips as EBMUD will operate the pumping plant remotely. Therefore it
would not affect policies supporting alternative transportation.

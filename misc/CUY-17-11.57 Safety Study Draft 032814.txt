    INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE AND NEED
The purpose of this study is to evaluate existing safety performance and to identify potential
countermeasures to reduce congestion and traffic crashes at the intersection of State Route 17 (Brookpark
Road) and State Route 176 (Broadview Road) (SLM 11.57). This intersection is ranked 109 on the ODOT
2012 Urban Intersection Peak Searching Excess Locations.

A review of crash data provided by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) yielded a total of 67
reported crashes within the study area during a 3-year period between 2010 and 2012. The following
crash types and conditions are over represented at the study intersection compared to statewide averages
for state route, non-freeway locations (statewide averages shown in parenthesis). Note the statewide crash
averages are based on 2008-2012 data whereas the project data encompasses years 2010 to 2012.

    >   Total crashes: 67 total crashes
    >   Injury crashes: 26 crashes or 38.8 percent                                 (25.4 percent)
    >   Angle: 28 crashes or 41.8 percent                                          (15.6 percent)
    >   Rear end: 26 crashes or 38.8 percent                                       (30.9 percent)
    >   Left Turn: 6 crashes or 9.0 percent                                          (5.2 percent)
    >   Pedestrian: 1 crash or 1.5 percent                                           (0.8 percent)
    >   Road condition (wet): 27 crashes or 40.3 percent                           (21.1 percent)

BACKGROUND
State Route 17, herein referred to as Brookpark Road is an east-west route between Lorain Road (SR 10)
and Aurora Road (SR 43). Brookpark Road runs parallels to IR-480. Broadview Road is a north-south
roadway between Pearl Road (SR 3) and IR-271. Broadview Road south of Brookpark Road and
Brookpark Road east of Broadview Road are designated as State Route 176. The Brookpark
Road/Broadview Road intersection is within City of Cleveland jurisdiction, however the City of Parma
jurisdiction begins just south of the intersection. A project location map is provided in Figure 1 with a
study area map as Figure 2.

    EXISTING CONDITIONS
LAND USE
Land uses fronting Brookpark Road and Broadview Road are comprised of neighborhood businesses with
residential land adjacent to those businesses. Key businesses within the intersection influence area
include:

    >    CVS site ­ located in the southeast quadrant of the intersection
    >    Brookpark Shopping Center ­ located in the northwest quadrant of the intersection

The following schools are located adjacent to Broadview Road, north and south of the study intersection.
While access to these schools is not located within the intersection influence area, traffic patterns and
volumes are influenced. Outdated school crossing signs are provided within the intersection influence
area.

    >    John Muir Elementary School
    >    Parma preschool
    >    St. Leo Parish school
The functional area of an intersection is defined as the area beyond the physical intersection of two
roadways. The functional area for a leg of an intersection includes two components: one upstream of the
physical area of the intersection and one downstream. The upstream (or intersection approach) includes
additional length for decision-making, maneuvering, and required vehicle storage. The downstream area
consists of a conflict overlap distance that allows a through vehicle to clear the intersection in addition to
downstream conflict points. Access locations within the influence area of the Broadview Road/Brookpark
Road intersection are shown in Figure 2. Driver attention required to process potential conflicts with
vehicles entering or leaving these access points is diverted from the navigation task at the signalized
intersection.

ROADWAY AND INTERSECTION CONDITIONS
Brookpark Road intersects Broadview Road at a four-leg, signalized intersection. The intersection angle
is approximately 80 degrees which is within acceptable limits as outlined in the ODOT Location and
Design Manual.
Each approach to the intersection is a five-lane section comprised two through lanes in each direction and
a center left turn lane. The north leg of Broadview Road transitions to a four-lane section north of the
Brookpark Road intersection before crossing over IR-480. Sidewalks are present on both sides of
Brookpark Road and Broadview Road. Overhead lighting is provided at the intersection, with cobra style
lighting mounted on wood poles.

Existing roadway conditions are summarized in Table 1 with existing conditions diagrams in Appendix
A.

The traffic signal at the study intersection is a mast arm design featuring the following operational
parameters:

    >    Left turn movements are controlled as protected/permissive operation with 5-section signal heads
    >    Marked crosswalks, pedestrian signal heads and pedestrian pushbuttons are provided for all
         crossings
    >    A 2 second all red clearance is programmed for all through movements and a 1 second all red for
         left turn phases

The following observations were documented during field review:
    >    Vehicles were observed to stop forward of the stop line on the northbound approach (left turn
         lane) due to permissive LT phase.
    >    Extended queues were observed for left turning vehicles on the westbound approach during the
         PM peak hour. Vehicle queues were observed to extend as the Jennings Freeway (SR-176) ramp
         intersection located approximately 1200 feet east of Broadview Road. See Photo 1.
    >    Extended queues were observed for right turning vehicles (curb lane) on the northbound approach
         during both the morning and evening peak hours Vehicles queues of 500 feet were observed for
         this movement. See Photo 2.
    >    The vehicular access point to the CVS site on Broadview is positioned approximately 165 feet
         south of the stop line for northbound traffic. This driveway location is within the area that vehicle
         queues that form on the northbound approach.
    >    The vehicular access point to the shopping center on the north leg of Broadview (west side) is
         positioned approximately 100 feet from the stop line for southbound traffic. This driveway is
         within the area that vehicle queues form on the southbound approach. The access point location is
         further complicated limited sight distance attributed to the vertical profile of Broadview Road
         across IR-480.

DATA COLLECTION
Manual turning movement counts were collected at the Brookpark Road/Broadview Road intersection on
November 21, 2013 from 7-11 AM and from 2-6 PM. Volume adjustments were made to account for the
unserved demand on the westbound approach during the PM peak hour. These adjustments are described
in more detail in a memorandum provided in Appendix B. Count data was submitted to NOACA with a
request for design year growth rates. The NOACA information suggested no background growth over the
next 20 years. Counted volumes adjusted for unserved demand represent design year traffic projections
for the purpose of this study. Adjusted volumes were used in preparation of the detailed analyses
contained in this report. Count data and design year traffic volume forecasts are provided in Appendix B.

      CRASH ANALYSIS
CRASH DATA
Crash data was furnished by the Ohio Department of Transportation for Brookpark Road/Broadview
Road intersection, encompassing a three-year period between 2010 and 2012. The OH-1 crash report for
each documented crash was reviewed to confirm accuracy and to locate crashes properly within the study
limits. Crash diagrams are provided in Appendix C. Noteworthy crash statistics for the three-year period
are summarized below and shown in Graphs 1 and 2.

      >   Total crashes: 67 total crashes
      >   Injury: 26 crashes or 38.8 percent                                                                   (25.4 percent)
      >   Angle: 28 crashes or 41.8 percent                                                                    (15.6 percent)

HIGHWAY SAFETY MANUAL
The predictive method described in Part C of the Highway Safety Manual provides steps to estimate the
expected average crash frequency of a site for a given time period, geometric design, traffic control
features, and traffic volumes. The expected average crash frequency (Nexpected) is estimated using a
predictive model estimate of crash frequency for a specific site type (Npredicted) together with observed
crash frequency (where available).

Predicted average crash frequency: This step involves determination of the predicted crash frequency
which reflects how a site would be expected to perform relative to 1,000 similar sites. Calculation of
predicted crash frequency utilizes Safety Performance Functions (SPF) for a base condition. Crash
Modification Factors (CMF) are applied to account for specific site characteristics that differ from the
base condition. A state-level calibration factor is then applied to normalize the base condition to localized
conditions. The resulting value is the Predicted Crash Frequency (Npredicted)

Expected average crash frequency: The next step involves calculation of the expected average crash
frequency which reflects average performance of the site over an extended period of time based on actual
crash history. This step incorporates the Empirical Bayes (EB) method which combines actual (observed)
crash history of the study site with predicted average crash frequency. These values are weighted based
on an over-dispersion parameter (k) that is the measure of the strength of the model (safety performance
factors). The resulting value is the expected average crash frequency (Nexpected)

EXPECTED EXCESS CRASH RESULTS
The difference between the predicted and expected average crash frequencies is termed the "Expected
Excess Crashes" for the site, as shown in Figure 3. If the expected average crash frequency is greater than
the predicted average crash frequency, then the site has potential for safety improvement. If expected
frequency is less than predicted frequency, then the site is expected to experience fewer crashes per year
on average than its peers.

The HSM predictive method for urban/suburban arterials was applied to the Brookpark Road/Broadview
Road intersection to determine the potential for safety improvement. A single intersection element was
included in the evaluation. Results presented in Table 3 conclude that the expected crash frequency is
slightly below the predicted crash frequency for the study intersection, suggesting that the site
experiences on average fewer crashes per year than its peers. A closer look at the crash frequency for
angle type crashes reveals that the expected crash frequency exceeds the predicted crash frequency,
suggesting that there is potential for safety improvements for angle crashes.

OBSERVED CRASH HISTORY
A review of observed and documented crash history in the study suggests patterns that are consistent with
urban/suburban corridors comprised of a large number of intersections and driveways. Prevalent patterns
are described below:

Angle Crashes
Angle crashes are the most prevalent crashes at the study intersection. A total of 28 angle crashes were
reported within the 3-year analysis period with 12 of those crashes resulting in injury. Of the 26 angle
crashes, 11 were intersection related and 17 were driveway related.
The 11 intersection-related angle crashes included 5 right angle crashes and 6 left turn angle crashes. The
right angle crashes involve vehicles travelling opposing roadways and all were attributed to red light
violations.
Most of the driveway-related angle crashes were concentrated at the following two locations. The
majority of these crashes involve left turn movements made from the access driveway to Broadview
Road. This pattern is indicative of traffic exiting the development site and attempting to cross through
vehicle queues that have formed on Broadview Road.

    >   9 crashes at the shopping center access driveway on the north leg of Broadview Road
    >   5 crashes at the CVS access driveway on the south leg of Broadview Road

Rear end crashes
Rear end crashes are the second most prevalent crash type at the study intersection. A total of 26 rear end
crashes were reported within the 3-year analysis period 10 of those crashes resulting in injury. The
westbound approach experienced the most prevalent pattern of rear end crashes comprising 10 of the 26
total crashes. A review of rear end crashes by hour of day indicates that 50-percent occur between 2PM
and 5PM during the commuter peaks when traffic congestions is highest.

Left turn crashes
All six of the left turn crashes occurred within the intersection and were distributed equally between the
eastbound, westbound and northbound approaches. 67 percent of the left turn crashes resulted in injury. A
contributing factor for left turn crashes is failure to yield to opposing through traffic during permissive
left turn phase.

Pedestrian crash
One pedestrian crash was reported within the 3-year analysis period. This crash involved a 16 year old
who was crossing the east leg of Brookpark Road in the marked crosswalk. The crash occurred when the
pedestrian attempted to cross the east leg of Brookpark Road during the "Do Not Walk" phase and
entered the path of a westbound vehicle that was proceeding through the intersection during a green
phase. The driver attempted to brake to avoid the collision but was unsuccessful. This crash occurred on a
Monday at 5PM under wet pavement conditions.

Wet pavement crashes
40 percent (27 crashes) of the total intersection crashes occurred during wet pavement conditions

    COUNTERMEASURES
The following section addresses contributing factors associated with the prevalent crashes patterns at the
Broadview Road/Brookpark Road intersection and possible countermeasures to mitigate those crashes.
Additional countermeasures are recommended to minimize potential safety issues that may not be directly
attributed to historical crash trends. Detailed technical analyses including intersection capacity reports,
clearance interval calculations and turn lane sizing calculations are summarized in Appendix E, F and G.
A conceptual plan of the proposed countermeasure is shown in Figure 4.

ALL CRASHES
The following countermeasures are recommended to mitigate all crashes at the Broadview
Road/Brookpark Road intersection.

    >   Modify lane configuration on northbound Brookpark Road: Modification to the lane use on
        the northbound approach of Brookpark Road is recommended to address capacity deficiencies
        and peak hour vehicle queuing. The recommendation is to change the northbound approach from
        a L-T-TR configuration to a L-T-R (i.e. converting the shared through/right turn curb lane to a
        right turn only lane). This will allow for inclusion of a right turn overlap phase that will more
        efficiently serve the high demand for the northbound right turn movement during peak hours.
    >   Advance and reorient stop lines on Broadview Road: Advancing the stop lines on Broadview
        Road toward the intersection is recommended to reduce all red clearance intervals. Stop line
        location shown in Figure 4 are advanced and oriented parallel with the crosswalk.
    >   Upgrade clearance intervals: Modification of the yellow change and all red clearance times is
        recommended. Calculations have been prepared in accordance with the ODOT Traffic
        Engineering Manual and ITE recommended practices, as summarized in Appendix F.
        Recommended clearance intervals are based 35 MPH conditions for through movements on all
        approaches and actual crossing distances.
        NCHRP Report 731 dated July 2012 confirms that the ITE clearance interval guidelines are used
        by the highest percentage of state and local agencies resulting in a total crash reduction of 8 to 14
        percent ­ an injury reduction of 12 percent also can be expected. The NCHRP Report 731 also
        recommends using a design speed of 20 MPH for left turning vehicles. This finding is consistent
        with research conducted by the North Carolina Department of Transportation published by the
        ITE Journal which determined that the average operating speed for left turning traffic is 17 miles
        per hour. Clearance intervals for the leading protected left turn phases are based on a design
        speed of 20 miles per hour. This methodology helps provide adequate all-red clearance times
        based on operating speeds and avoids excessively long clearance intervals (yellow + AR).
    >   Upgrade existing traffic signal installation: Upgrades to the existing traffic signal are
        recommended in conjunction with the lane configuration and clearance interval changes and to
        address the observed need for signal maintenance. The recommendation includes the following
        components and has potential to mitigate all intersection related (non-driveway) crashes.
        ·   Replace all signal heads and provide reflective back plates on new heads
        ·   Install five section signal head for the NB approach and reprogram signal controller to
            provide a right turn overlap phase
        ·   Replace bulbs in all the pedestrian signal heads

ANGLE CRASHES ­ 14 CRASHES
The following access management improvements are recommended to mitigate driveway-related angle
crashes.

1. Install a bollard median design on the north leg of Broadview Road for a distance of approximately
   150 feet to control left turn movements to and from the shopping center access driveway on the west
   side. A bollard style design similar to what is shown in Photo 3 is a low cost option for controlling
   turning movements at access points. A higher cost solution is a raised median that could be
   considered as a long term countermeasure or as part of a CIP project.

2. Install a bollard median design on the south leg of Broadview Road for a distance of approximately
   150 feet to control left turn movements to and from the CVS access driveway on the east side. A
   bollard style design similar to what is shown in Photo 3 is a low cost option for controlling turning
   movements at access points. A higher cost solution is a raised median that could be considered as a
   long term countermeasure or as part of a CIP project.

OTHER SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS
The following improvements are recommended to address potential safety issues that are not directly
attributed to historical crash patterns.

    >   Upgrade School Crossing sign assemblies: The marked crosswalks on Broadview Road at the
        Brookpark Road intersection are currently designated as school crossing locations. The crossings
        signs are not compliant with the current OMUTCD and are recommended for upgrade.
        Additionally, school crossing signs are recommended on Brookpark Road since all crossings at
        this intersection could be used by school children.
        Recommend adding or installing new School Crossing assemblies on the northbound, eastbound
        and westbound approaches to the study intersection at and in advance of the marked crosswalk.
        School crossing signs are not recommended on the north crossing of Broadview Road. The sign
        assemblies at the crosswalk should be placed immediately adjacent to the crosswalk, such that the
        downward arrow is in line with the crossing. Additionally, a School Crossing sign assembly with
        "X feet" plaque should be placed in advance of each marked crossing to provide advanced
        warning. See Figure 5 for school crossing signage that cross references to the Figure 4 concept
        plan.

LONG TERM COUNTERMEASURES
The following long term countermeasures could be considered to further address safety issues at the
intersection.

    Widen Brookpark Road to provide dual westbound left turn lanes: The short term
       countermeasures will provide some capacity benefits but do not fully address all the capacity
       deficiencies at the intersection. Particularly, a high level of delay is still expected for the WB left
       turn movement in the design year. Capacity deficiencies have a direct effect on intersection safety
       as explained in this report. A potential solution is to widen Brookpark Road to provide dual
       westbound left turn lanes. With short term countermeasures in place, the v/c ratio for the WB left
       turn movement exceeds 1.0. Dual left turn lanes would provide a 20% increase in capacity
       (v/c=0.80) and a substantial decrease in delay for that movement. With the dual left turn lanes,
       overall intersection LOS D with all movements operating at volume to capacity ratios less than
       1.0 is expected during both peaks.
    >   Pavement resurfacing: The prevalence of crashes occurring on wet pavement suggests the need
        for pavement resurfacing to improve skid resistance. This is a high cost improvement that could
        be considered if implementation of the short term countermeasures does not fully mitigate safety
        issues. There is not a CMF for pavement resurfacing so this additional cost would reduce the
        cost/benefit ratio calculated in this report.
    >   Access management: A cross access agreement should be pursued for the two adjacent parcels
        located in the southwest quadrant of the intersection (Glass Masters site and adjacent strip retail
        site). An access sharing agreement is recommended when these parcels redevelop or change uses
        to consolidate individual access points on Broadview Road.

    BENEFIT COST ANALYSIS
Benefit cost analysis is a tool to determine the financial benefits of a project by comparing the net
present value (NPV) of a project to NPV of the safety benefit provided by that project. Benefit cost
values greater than one indicate a positive return on the original investment. Preferred
countermeasures are those having the highest NPV of safety benefits.

BENEFIT COST FOR SHORT TERM COUNTERMEASURES
A benefit cost analysis was prepared using the ODOT ECAT analysis tool. Crash modification factors
were applied for the following improvements. This does not account for all recommended
improvements, rather only those countermeasures that have CMF values.

    >    Improve visibility of signal heads (backplates): A CMF of 0.93 was applied to all crashes;
         This CMF was obtained from the FHWA Crash Clearinghouse and has 4 star quality rating.
    >    Modify change plus clearance intervals: A CMF of 0.91 was applied to all crashes. This is
         a standard CMF offering in the ODOT ECAT tool.
    >    Provide a right turn lane: A CMF value of 0.86 was applied to all intersection crashes. This
         CMF was obtained from the FHWA Crash Clearinghouse and has 4 star quality rating.
    >    Provide raised median: A CMF value of 0.697 was applied to all driveway related crashes.
         This CMF was obtained from the FHWA Crash Modification Factor Clearinghouse and has a
         3 star quality rating.
Project costs were estimated for all short term countermeasures shown in Figure 4 including traffic
signal upgrade, signing upgrades, pavement marking modifications, bollard median, etc. Construction
cost estimates assume the following:

    >    35 percent design risk
    >    13.8 percent inflation rate for an estimated 2016 construction year.
    >    No right of way impact anticipated

Cost estimates and benefit cost analysis reports from the ECAT tool are included in Appendix H.
Table 4 provides summarizes the benefit cost analysis results.

BENEFIT COST FOR LONG TERM COUNTERMEASURES
The higher cost potential for improvements involving pavement widening, such dual westbound left
turn lanes on Brookpark Road will challenge the ability to provide a good return on investment at a
location where there is not an excess crash frequency, as is the case with the Broadview/Brookpark
intersection. Assuming a $2 million dollar project cost for widening Brookpark Road, a benefit-cost
of 1.32 was calculated. While benefit-cost over 1.0 suggest a positive return on investment, any
variability in project costs could bring that value less than 1.0.

Subject: RE: District 12 growth rate request

Hello Scott

Enclosed please find the growth rates based on the Regional Model inputs for the requested locations.
Please note that the rates are for the 2012 to 2035 projects. The model is showing traffic decrease on all intersections
except the SR306 / SR84 intersection in Lake County.
In general when the forecast traffic is less than existing traffic you can do the analysis based on existing year 2012 traffic.
If you need a copy of the raw model numbers please let me know.
Let me know if you need additional information. Sorry for the delay and HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

Subject: District 12 growth rate request

Mahmound

LJB is working with District 12 on several safety study locations. Attached is current traffic data for these locations.

1. CUY-10-10.14 (Lorain Road (SR 10) at W. 150th Street)
2. CUY-10-11.94 (Lorain Road (SR 10) at W. 117th Street)
3. CUY-17-11.57 (Brookpark Road (SR 17) at Broadview Road (SR 176))
4. CUY-422-4.34 (Kinsman Road (US 422) at E. 93rd Street)
5. LAK-84-8.14 (Johnnycake Ridge Road (SR 84) at Broadmoor Road (SR 306))

Typically planning level growth rates are sufficient for use on a safety study. I am interested in a 20 year horizon.

Please advise when you are able to generate these numbers?

Thank you

Scott

Dave,

Attached (in PDF and Petra Pro file formats) are the intersection turning movement counts from Lorain Avenue at West
117th and West 150th. The counts were performed to collect data during the morning, midday and evening peak periods.

West 117th was counted on 11/14.

West 150th was a split count with the PM peak collected on 11/6 and the AM and midday time periods being counted on
11/13.

Please pass these counts on to ODOT for use in their project.

Thank you.

Subject:     CUY-17-11.57
Project #:   0108121A.00

A field review of CUY-17-11.57 was conducted on December 20, 2013. During the field review process,
LJB documented excessive queues in the Westbound left turn lane on Brookpark Road during the
afternoon peak hour. Queues were observed at approximately 1000 feet in length and extended to the
Westbound 176 exit ramp. LJB has therefore adjusted manual turn counts (collected November 21, 2013)
to account for the development of queues during the afternoon peak hour. Adjustments for the peak hour
traffic are as follows:

HSM OUTPUT
    HIGHWAY SAFETY MANUAL METHODOLOGY
The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) provides tools to conduct quantitative safety analyses with the primary
goal of predicting crash frequency and severity as a function of alternative roadway and intersection designs.
Prior to publication of the HSM in 2010, there was no industry-accepted resource available to quantify future
safety performance of a transportation facility. The HSM fills this need by providing a science-based
technical approach to safety analysis to predict "expected average crash frequency" ­ the long-term average
crash frequency of a site.

A primary reason for incorporating techniques of the Highway Safety Manual into the crash analysis process
is to overcome the short-term year-to-year variability in observed crash frequencies and the effects of
"regression to the mean" bias. Regression-to-the-mean (RTM) is the natural variation in crash data. Crash
occurrences at a given site are random events that tend to fluctuate up and down over the course of time.
Year-to-year variability in crash frequencies as shown in Figure D1 adversely affects crash estimation based
on crash data collected over short periods (i.e. 3 years as is customary). The randomness of crash occurrences
indicates that short-term crash frequencies alone are not a reliable estimator of long-term crash frequency.

Crash fluctuations over time make it difficult to determine whether changes in the observed crash frequency
are due to changes in site conditions or are due to natural fluctuations. When a period of high crash
frequency is observed, it is statistically probable that the following period will have a comparatively low
crash frequency. Similarly, there is a high probability that a low crash frequency period will be followed by a
high crash frequency period. This tendency is known as regression-to-the-mean (RTM).

Failure to account for the effects of RTM introduces the potential for "RTM bias" or "selection bias". This
occurs when sites are selected for treatment based on short-term trends in observed crash frequency. RTM
bias can also result in over or under estimation of effectiveness of a treatment (change in average crash
frequency) ­ without accounting for RTM bias, it is not possible to know if an observed reduction in crashes
is due to the treatment or if it would have occurred without the modification.

Figure D2 shows the effect of RTM and RTM bias. In this example, a site is selected for treatment based on
its short term crash frequency trend over three years (during upward trend). Due to RTM, it is probable that
the observed crash frequency will decrease toward the expected average crash frequency without any

treatment. A treatment is applied which results in a reduction of crashes and become the "perceived
effectiveness of treatment". However, some of this reduction would have occurred regardless of the
treatment (due to RTM), rendering the perceived effectiveness of the treatment to be greater than its actual
effectiveness.

The predictive method described in Part C of the Highway Safety Manual provides steps to estimate the
expected average crash frequency of a site for a given time period, geometric design, traffic control features,
and traffic volumes. The expected average crash frequency (Nexpected) is estimated using a predictive model
estimate of crash frequency for a specific site type (Npredicted) together with observed crash frequency (where
available), as described in the following sections. The predictive method is applicable for the following
facility types: Rural Two-Lane Two-Way Roads, Rural Multilane Highways, and Urban/Suburban Arterials.

PREDICTED CRASH FREQUENCY
Predicted model estimate of crash frequency (Equation 1): This step involves determination of the
predicted crash frequency which reflects how a site would be expected to perform relative to 1,000 similar
sites. Calculation of predicted crash frequency utilizes Safety Performance Functions (SPF) for a base
condition. Crash Modification Factors (CMF) are then applied to account for specific site characteristics that
differ from the base condition. A state-level calibration factor is then applied to normalize the base condition
to localized conditions. The resulting value is the Predicted Crash Frequency (Npredicted)

         = SPFxCMF1 xCMF2 x ... xC                                        Equation 1
                                              
EXPECTED CRASH FREQUENCY
Expected average crash frequency (Equations 2 and 3): The next step involves calculation of the expected
average crash frequency which reflects average performance of the site over an extended period of time
based on actual crash history. This step incorporates the Empirical Bayes (EB) method which combines
actual (observed) crash history of the study site with predicted average crash frequency. These values are
weighted based on an over-dispersion parameter (k) that is the measure of the strength of the model (safety
performance factors). The resulting value is the expected average crash frequency (Nexpected)

          = x + 1.00 - x                                                   Equation 2
         Where Weighted Adjustment (w):
          = 1/[1 + x ]                                                     Equation 3
         Where k = over dispersion parameter from the associated SPF.

CLEARANCE INTERVAL

    CLEARANCE INTERVALS
The National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 731: Guidelines for Timing
Yellow and All-Red Intervals at Signalized Intersections was published July 2012. A number of
conclusions were reached as a result of the comprehensive study that is important to the safety
performance of signalized intersections.

    >    The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Proposed Recommended Practice for the
         calculation of yellow change intervals and all-red clearance intervals is the methodology used by
         the highest percentage of state and local agencies.

    >    Drivers were documented to decelerate when turning at an intersection. The NCHRP Report 731
         recommended using a design speed of 20 mile per hour for the calculation of all red timing.
         Research conducted by the North Carolina Department of Transportation published by the ITE
         Journal determined that the average operating speed for left turning traffic is 17 miles per hour.

    >    Using the current ITE guidelines to calculate the duration of yellow change and red clearance
         intervals has been shown to reduce total crashes between 8 and 14 percent while reducing injury
         crashes by approximately 12 percent.

    >    Using the current ITE guidelines to calculate the duration of yellow change and red clearance
         intervals has been shown to reduce red light running occurrences between 36 and 50 percent.

Vehicular clearance times were calculated for each study area intersection based on guidelines published
in the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the ITE Proposed Recommended Practice.
The following posted speeds were used to calculate clearance intervals:

             ·    35 MPH for through movements on Brookpark Road and Broadview Road
             ·    25 MPH speed for all leading left turn phases.
Calculated clearance intervals were included in the No Build and Build Synchro models. A summary of
the calculated clearance intervals is provided in Table E1 with detailed calculations include below.

    CAPACITY ANALYSIS
Capacity analysis was conducted for existing and proposed conditions at the Broadview Road/Brookview
Road intersection. Signalized intersection analysis was performed with the assistance of Synchro (version
8) traffic simulation software with output reflective of HCS algorithms. The following scenarios were
evaluated.

    >    Existing Conditions (2013)
         ·    Existing lane use
         ·    Existing signal timing and phasing
    >    No Build Conditions (2035)
         ·    Existing lane use
         ·    Optimized signal timing (splits), calculated yellow change and all-red clearance intervals

    >    Build Conditions (2035) ­ Short Term
         ·    Revised lane usage for the northbound Brookpark approach consisting of a left, through and
              right turn lane (L-T-R)
         ·    Optimized signal timing (cycle length and splits), calculated yellow change and all-red
              clearance intervals
         ·    Right turn overlap phase for the NB right turn movements

    >    Build Conditions (2035) ­ Long Term
         ·    Widen westbound approach to a L-L-T-TR from a L-T-TR configuration

         ·    Optimized signal timing (cycle length and splits), calculated yellow change and all-red
              clearance intervals
         ·    Right turn overlap phase for the NB right turn movements

Intersections are graded using a level of service (LOS) designation expressed in terms of letter grades.
Level of service is a quality measure describing operational conditions with a traffic stream with LOS A
representing the highest quality traffic flow and minimal delay, and LOS F representing poor traffic
operations, significant delay, and substantial queuing. Level of service is defined in terms of vehicle
delay, as published in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2010). Levels of
service thresholds for signalized intersections have been summarized in Table F1.

APPENDIX F - CAPACITY ANALYSIS REPORTS             1
Capacity analyses results for the AM and PM peak hours are summarized in Table F2. Results indicated
that there are capacity deficiencies with existing conditions during both peak hours.

     >      Existing Conditions
            · Northbound through-right turn movement (LOS F or 297.3 sec/vehicle delay AM Peak)
            · Southbound left turn movement (LOS F or 98.3 sec/vehicle delay AM Peak)
            · Westbound left turn movement (LOS F or 132.0 sec/vehicle delay PM Peak)

     >      No Build Conditions
            · Results comparable to the Existing Conditions

     >      Build Conditions ­ Short Term
            · With the recommended lane use change for northbound Brookpark to a L-T-R configuration
               and a right turn overlap phase, improved conditions are expected. Overall intersection LOS D
               is expected during both peak hours; however, lower LOS is expected for certain movements
               including the NB right turn, the SB left turn, WB left turn, and NB left turn. Volume to
               capacity ratios are less than 1.0 for all movements with the exception of the WB left turn
               during PM peak.

            · Dual left turn lanes on the westbound Brookpark Road approach will provide additional
               benefits to the westbound left turn movement. With short term improvements only, the v/c
               ratio for the WB left turn movement exceeds 1.0. Dual left turn lanes would provide a 20%
               increase in capacity (v/c=0.80) and a substantial decrease in delay for that movement. Overall
               intersection LOS D is expected during both peak hours; with all movements operating at
               volume to capacity ratios less than 1.0 during both peaks.

STORAGE LENGTH
 CALCULATIONS
     STORAGE LANE LENGTHS
Lane lengths were calculated for turn lanes at the S.R. 17/Broadview Road intersection for the build
condition. Lane lengths were first calculated using guidelines specified in the Location and Design Manual
Section 401 (Ohio Department of Transportation). Lane lengths based on the ODOT's standard criteria
assume design speed limits and include vehicle storage and a 50 foot diverging taper. The calculated lengths
were compared to the 95th percentile queue lengths generated by SimTraffic modeling software for the short
term alternative. A summary of the lane sizing comparison is shown in Table F1 with lane sizing
calculations attached to this section.

Turn lane lengths were calculated using the following parameters:
                >    2035 AM and PM peak traffic volumes
                >    40 MPH design speed for S.R. 17 and Broadview Road
                >    Optimized cycle length (AM Peak ­ 120 secs, PM Peak ­ 140 secs)
                >    Lengths rounded up in 5-foot increments

I.   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Town of Waynesville, North Carolina has identified the need to improve the Russ Avenue
Corridor from the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway (US 23-74) interchange to Walnut
Street. The purpose of this study is develop a feasible corridor plan which includes plans for
future travel demand; intersection improvements; access configuration and management;
median and edge landscaping; and pedestrian, bicycle, and public transportation facilities along
the Russ Avenue corridor. Planning level project cost estimates will also be developed for use
by the Town of Waynesville in its transportation planning process. This study is the initial step
in the planning process for this project and is not the product of detailed environmental or
design analysis.

Russ Avenue is a part of the major north-south transportation corridor through Waynesville
and forms the major eastern gateway into the town from the Great Smoky Mountains
Expressway (US 23-74). As such, the efficiency and attractiveness of the road shape many
visitors' first impression of the town and the quality of many residents' daily lives.

Russ Avenue currently functions with a dual purpose: 1) to provide through access from the
Great Smoky Mountains Expressway into the heart of Waynesville, and 2) to provide access to a
variety of retail stores and restaurants that line the roadway. This dual purpose with heavy
through volumes, combined with heavy turning movements can cause congestion and driver
confusion, particularly in the peak hours. The developments along the corridor are supportive
of primarily automobile use, with few sidewalk connections and bicycle and pedestrian
amenities.

As Waynesville's most heavily travelled thoroughfare, Russ Avenue experiences extended
periods of congestion, specifically during the morning and afternoon peak hours. Due to
numerous driveways along Russ Avenue, there is a significant amount of left-turning
movements throughout the corridor, which creates additional congestion and driver confusion,
decreasing safety

The development of concepts for the area that meet the goals established for this project was an
extremely iterative process that included a significant amount of stakeholder and public input.
A wide variety of transportation options were considered, including:

     ·   Roundabouts
     ·   6-lane section
     ·   2-lane section
     ·   4-lane section
     ·   Parallel facilities

As part of the development of concepts for the area, several meetings were held during the
process of this study in order to obtain input from the Town of Waynesville staff and public
officials, as well as the citizens of Waynesville.

A detailed traffic analysis was performed of the existing conditions, expected future conditions
without any roadway improvements, and future conditions with the recommended alternative.
                                                                                       Russ Avenue
                                                                                      Corridor Study
                                                                                             Page 2

Existing levels of service were calculated for the study area intersections using the existing lane
configurations and signal timings. With the exception of Barber Boulevard in the PM peak
hour, there were no major capacity problems identified in the study area. The poor level-of-
service at Barber Road was expected, as a high number of accidents were reported at this
intersection in 2006 and 2007. The 2008 AM and PM existing conditions capacity analyses
results for the Russ Avenue corridor is included in Table 2.

Not included in the capacity analysis is the effect of the multiple driveways along Russ Avenue.
These driveways serve to increase congestion, lowering level of service and decreasing safety.
The five-lane undivided cross section with continuous two-way left turn lane coupled with the
multiple driveways has a dramatic effect on traffic operations due to the absence of any access
control.

Most major intersections in the project area are expected to continue operating at acceptable
LOS during the 2030 AM & PM No-Build Scenario. However the LOS did worsen the
unacceptable LOS at the Russ Avenue intersections with Barber Boulevard, Dellwood Road /
Howell Mill Road (in the PM peak), and US 23/74 Northbound ramp (in the PM peak, in the
westbound approach). The 2030 No-Build Scenario Condition analyses results for the AM &
PM peak hours for the Russ Avenue corridor is included in Table 2.

As with the existing conditions, the five-lane undivided cross section with continuous two-way
left turn lane coupled with the multiple driveways will continue to cause increased traffic
congestion and decreased safety as through and turning movement volumes grow in the study
area.

The 2030 Buildout Conditions assumes the redistribution of some of the through volumes on
Russ Avenue to connectors between Waynesville Plaza and Howell Mill Road and between
Barber Boulevard and Frazier Street, in order to alleviate some of the congestion at these
intersections along the Russ Avenue corridor. The 2030 Buildout Condition capacity analyses
results for the AM and PM peak hours for the study area intersections including the
recommendations developed through the public involvement process are included in Table 2.

This analysis indicates that all study area intersections should operate with a reasonable level of
service and delay in 2030 with the recommended improvements. Additionally, the addition of a
median along Russ Avenue should greatly increase safety and congestion at the driveways
between the major study area intersections.                Appropriate pedestrian and bicycle
accommodations should also encourage multi-modal travel in the area, encouraging people to
leave their vehicle at one location and walk to their destinations, and to walk from some of the
adjacent residential neighborhoods to destinations within the study area.

To accommodate for the projected design year 2030 traffic volumes along Russ Avenue, the
following improvements are recommended:
                                                                                 Russ Avenue
                                                                                Corridor Study
                                                                                       Page 3

NEW CONNECTOR ROADS
  · Construct a connector road that extends from Frazier Street to the intersection of Russ
     Avenue and Barber Boulevard to form a 4-leg intersection.
  · Construct a connector road from Frazier Street (behind the Shell Gas Station) to Russ
     Avenue where the existing abandoned Long John Silver restaurant sits. This new
     connector road would be located behind McDonalds and CVS.

   · Construct a new 5-lane bridge over Richland Creek to allow for northbound and
     southbound left turn lanes. This bridge should be of sufficient length to allow for a
     greenway underneath the structure.
   · Construct a new 5-lane bridge over the rail line to allow for northbound and
     southbound left turn lanes.

RUSS AVENUE
  · Construct a 4-lane landscaped median divided, curb and gutter roadway with turn lanes
     at key intersections.
  · Construct sidewalks along both sides of the roadway.
  · Construct bicycle lanes along both sides of the roadway.

 Frazier Street Intersection
 · Construct a southbound left turn lane on Russ Avenue with 100 feet of storage.
 · Construct an eastbound shared left turn / through lane and a right turn lane with 100
    feet of storage on Frazier Street.
 · Construct a westbound shared left/through/right turn lane on the new Frazier Street
    connector.
 · Construct a traffic signal.

 Barber Boulevard Intersection
 · Construct an eastbound left turn lane with 150 feet of storage a through lane and a right
    turn lane with 100 feet of storage on Barber Boulevard.
 · Construct a westbound left turn lane with 150 feet of storage and shared through/right
    turn lane on Barber Boulevard.
 · Construct a northbound left turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a right turn lane with
    100 feet of storage on Russ Avenue.

Probable costs for the recommended roadway improvements were developed using cost
estimates provided by the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization and quantities
developed from the conceptual design plans. A summary of the planning level cost estimates
for the proposed improvements are included in the table below.

The Russ Avenue Corridor Study is the initial step in the planning and design process for the
development of a project. The public, Town of Waynesville and the French Broad River
Metropolitan Planning Organization all contributed greatly in the development of a future plan
for the Russ Avenue corridor that can safely and efficiently accommodate all modes of travel
and will enhance the aesthetics of the corridor.

in the planning process for this project and is not the product of detailed environmental or
design analysis. The general location and project study area are shown in Figure 1.

Russ Avenue is a part of the major north-south transportation corridor through Waynesville
and forms the major eastern gateway into the town from the Great Smoky Mountains
Expressway (US 23-74). As such, the efficiency and attractiveness of the road shape many
visitors' first impression of the town and the quality of many residents' daily lives.

The goals for this project, as developed by the Town of Waynesville and the French Broad River
Metropolitan Planning Organization are as follows:

1.    Analyze roadway capacity and future travel demand
2.    Analyze and design intersection improvements
3.    Analyze and design access from abutting properties
4.    Analyze and design pedestrian and bicycle facilities
5.    Analyze and design opportunities for landscaped median and street tree planting strips
6.    Address aesthetics, gateway features, and context-sensitive roadway design
7.    Obtain community input as to current problems and desired solutions
8.    Develop recommendations for improvements designed to meet community goals
9.    Develop a priority listing of implementation strategies
10.   Develop perspective illustrations of streetscape improvements and plan view renderings
      of roadway improvements
11.   Produce a document that can be used as a blueprint for public and private sector decisions
      concerning road improvements and development of adjacent properties

This report includes improvements to Russ Avenue from the Great Smoky Mountains
Expressway from the north to Walnut Street in the south.
The study also includes considerations of improvements
to major intersections and adjacent and parallel surface
streets within the study area to improve traffic flow along
the corridor. While the study primarily focuses on
improvements to Russ Avenue, it also includes pedestrian
and bicycle facilities and side street connections which
may be implemented to provide a safer and more efficient
roadway network.

III.   BACKGROUND INFORMATION
 Study Area Description
 Russ Avenue (US 276) is a major north-south thoroughfare that connects US 19 to the north and
 Walnut Street to the south. The segment between the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway (US
 23/74) and Walnut Street (approximately 0.8 miles) serves as a gateway into Waynesville. As
 such, the efficiency and attractiveness of the road shape a great deal of visitors' first impression
 of the town and the quality of many residents' everyday lives.

 Russ Avenue currently functions with a dual purpose: 1) to provide through access from the
 Great Smoky Mountains Expressway into the heart of Waynesville, and 2) to provide access to a
 variety of retail stores and restaurants that line the roadway. This dual purpose with heavy
 through volumes, combined with heavy turning movements can cause congestion and driver
 confusion, particularly in the peak hours. The developments along the corridor are supportive
 of primarily automobile use, with few sidewalk connections and bicycle and pedestrian
 amenities.

 The study area consists of the US 23-74 / Russ Avenue partial cloverleaf interchange and
 nearby roadways intersecting Russ Avenue. The minor roadways evaluated in the study area
 include Frazier Street, Betsy Acres Lane, Barber Boulevard, Dellwood Road/Howell Mill Road,
 Border Street (Shopping Center Access), Waynesville Plaza driveway (Shopping Center Access),
 Lee Street, West Marshall Street, and Walnut Street. The intersections along Russ Avenue at
 Phillips Road, Barber Boulevard, Dellwood Road/Howell Mill Road, West Marshall Street, and
 Walnut Street are currently signalized. All other intersections are stop-controlled on the minor
 side-street approaches. Figure 1 shows the project study area.

 Existing Conditions
 As Waynesville's most heavily travelled thoroughfare, Russ Avenue experiences extended
 periods of congestion, specifically during the morning and afternoon peak hours. Due to
 numerous driveways along Russ Avenue, there is a significant amount of left-turning
 movements throughout the corridor, which creates additional congestion and driver confusion,
 decreasing safety.

  The following is a description of the study area roadways, crash statistics, projected roadway
 improvements, and land uses.

 A.    Study Area Roadways

 Figure 1 shows the project study area along Russ Avenue. The existing geometrics and
 intersection traffic control for existing roadways and intersections within the study area are
 shown schematically in Figure 2. The following is a brief description of existing roadways and
 intersections within the study area:
                                                                                        Russ Avenue
                                                                                       Corridor Study
                                                                                              Page 8

Russ Avenue (US 276) is a major northbound-southbound thoroughfare located in the Town of
Waynesville. Within the study area, Russ Avenue is a
five-lane roadway section, with a continuous two-way
center left-turn lane and multiple driveway cuts from the
beginning limits of the project (US 23 / 74) to its end in
the southern direction at Walnut Street. Not only does
Russ Avenue provide direct access to Waynesville, it also
serves as the primary access to Lake Junaluska.

The Town of Waynesville has identified Russ Avenue as

Dellwood Drive (SR 1247) / Howell Mill Road (SR 1184) are major connector roads within the
project study area. Dellwood Drive primarily serves as a connector street linking Russ Avenue
to the Frog Level area and provides a secondary access to downtown Waynesville via Depot
Street. Primary development along Dellwood Drive is a mostly commercial with some minor
residential developments. There is no published AADT data available on Dellwood Drive. The
posted speed limit on Dellwood Drive is 30 MPH.

Howell Mill Road serves as a major connector from Russ Avenue to Asheville Road (Business
US 23). Primary development along Howell Mill Road is a mixture of residential, retail, and
commercial. The 2008 AADT volume on Howell Mill Road as published by NCDOT is
approximately 4,700 VPD just east of its intersection with Russ Avenue. The posted speed limit
on Howell Mill Road is 35 MPH east of Russ Avenue.

West Marshall Street is a connector road within the project study area. This connector's
western leg begins on the southern end of Russ Avenue and continues to North Main Street (US
23 Business) on its eastern leg. No AADT data is available on West Marshall Street and no
speed limit is posted. Since it is a local town street, the speed limit is assumed to be 35 MPH.


Walnut Street is a connector road on the southern end of
the project study area. Walnut Street begins where Russ
Avenue ends just south of its bridge over the Norfolk
Southern Railroad, and continues southward into the
downtown Waynesville area. The 2008 AADT volume on
Walnut Street, as published by NCDOT, is approximately
5,900 VPD just north of its intersection with North Main
Street and at its southern end. The posted speed limit on
Walnut Street is 20 MPH.

                                   Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
                                   There are no designated bicycle facilities along the Russ Avenue
                                   corridor. Sidewalks exist along the majority of Russ Avenue and
                                   are typically located immediately adjacent to the curb. There are
                                   few crosswalks along the corridor and no crosswalks are provided
                                   for individuals wishing to cross Russ Avenue. Traffic signals do
                                   not contain pedestrian signal heads or actuation.

                                   Bridges
                                   Bridge No. 870184 is located over the Norfolk Southern Railroad
                                   line. This steel structure was constructed in 1968. According to
                                   NCDOT, the bridge is currently functionally obsolete with a
                                   sufficiency rating of 73.3%. It qualifies for replacement due to

Bridge No. 870186 is located over Richland Creek. This pre-stressed concrete structure was
constructed in 1967. According to NCDOT, the bridge is functionally obsolete with a
sufficiency rating of 75.6%. It qualifies for replacement due to substandard load carrying
capacity or substandard bridge roadway geometry.

Existing Lane Configurations and Traffic Control are
illustrated on Figure 2.

B.   Crash Data

According to the Town of Waynesville Police
Department accident report archives, multiple accidents
have occurred on Russ Avenue in recent years. One-
hundred five (105) accidents were reported in 2006 and
                                                              Russ Avenue looking southbound with
ninety-four (94) in 2007. Of those accidents, those with
                                                               Richland Creek Bridge and Railroad
reported injuries included fifteen (15) in 2006 and                   Bridge in background.
twenty-one (21) in 2007.       Estimated damages were
$160,600 in 2006 and $179,219 in 2007. In 2006, the majority of the accidents reported occurred
at the McDonalds driveway, Barber Boulevard, Dellwood Road, and Howell Mill Road. In
2007, the majority of the accidents reported occurred at Barber Boulevard, Howell Mill Road,
and the Kmart driveway, coinciding with some of the areas of densest development within the
study area. See Appendix A for a detailed breakdown of the reported accidents.

C. Projected Roadway Improvements

Based on the 2009-2015 State Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)2, there is one project
in the vicinity of the Russ Avenue study area. A brief description of the project is included
below:

TIP Project No. U-4412: Waynesville, Haywood County. SR 1184 (Howell Mill Road), US 276
to US 23 Business. Upgrade two lanes and construct railroad grade separation. At the time of
this study, the right-of-way is scheduled for December 2009 with construction in January 2012.
                                                                                     Russ Avenue
                                                                                    Corridor Study
                                                                                          Page 12

D. Land Uses


Land uses along the corridor are primarily retail and restaurant oriented. Immediately adjacent
to the US 23/74/Russ Avenue interchange are several motels including the Lodge and Days Inn
located along the west side of Russ Avenue with the Hillcrest Memorial Gardens located
southeast of the interchange.

Sit-down restaurants such as Sagebrush Steakhouse, Pizza Hut, and Zaxby's as well as
numerous fast food establishments such as McDonalds, Wendy's, KFC, Arby's, and Hardee's
are all located along the Russ Avenue corridor with most having individual driveway accesses
to Russ Avenue. There is one Shell gas station in the southwest quadrant of Russ Avenue and
Frazier Street. Several pharmacies such as CVS and Rite Aid are located along the corridor
Three shopping centers, anchored by Ingle's and Belk, with specialty restaurants and other
retail shops are located along the east side of Russ Avenue. Other land uses located along the
corridor include banks, ATM machines, AutoBell Car Wash, Sear's, Enterprise Rental Car, and
Taylor Motors Company.

Most businesses along Russ Avenue have an individual driveway access and in some cases,
have multiple driveway curb cuts. This is one of the main causes of the high frequency of
crashes along Russ Avenue.



IV. ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT

The development of concepts for the area that meet the goals established for this project was an
extremely iterative process that included a significant amount of stakeholder and public input.
A wide variety of transportation options were considered, including;

Roundabouts ­ a system of single land and 2-lane roundabouts were considered along Russ
Avenue. Traffic analysis of these roundabouts is included later in the report. Roundabouts
would likely provide an attractive alternative by providing options for aesthetic improvements
within the center of the roundabouts and would improve pedestrian connectivity along and
across Russ Avenue.

6-lane section ­ a 6-lane cross section with a narrow center median was also considered to
increase through capacity along Russ Avenue. This alternative was rejected due to the
additional right-of-way need for the additional through lanes as well as the need for left turn
lanes at strategic locations along the corridor. This alternative would also not be aesthetically
pleasing with the narrow concrete center median.

2-lane section ­ a 2-lane section was also considered, which would allow for a striped bike lane,
a wide center median, and expanded sidewalks. This option was eliminated from consideration
due to the capacity needed for through volumes along Russ Avenue
                                                                                     Russ Avenue
                                                                                    Corridor Study
                                                                                          Page 13

Parallel facilities ­ attempts were made to develop a system of parallel facilities that would
work to relieve much of the local access traffic from Russ Avenue. The variety of stream
crossings and challenging grades in the area made the development of a true parallel road
system difficult, but the final alternative includes several connections that utilize existing
roadways and shopping centers to provide alternative routes for local access traffic.

As part of the development of concepts for the area, several meetings were held during the
process of this study in order to obtain input from the Town of Waynesville staff and public
officials, as well as the citizens of Waynesville. Minutes from each of the meetings are attached
in Appendix C. A Kick-off Meeting and two (2) Public Workshops were held in addition to the
several project team meetings.

A.       1st Public Workshop

The 1st Public Workshop was held on August 21, 2008
at the Waynesville Recreation Center, from 5:00 pm to
7:00 pm.      Twenty-four (24) citizens signed the
attendance sheet. The purpose of this workshop was to
get the citizens assistance in identifying issues and
concerns, and in gathering suggestions on how to
improve upon them. Sixteen (16) written comments
were received from Town of Waynesville residents
concerning the issues the perceived along Russ
Avenue. The following is a summary of some of the
general suggestions, comments, and concerns
regarding the corridor.

     ·   Address the median and center turn lane along Russ Avenue in front of McDonalds and
         CVS
     ·   Correct the intersection alignment of Russ Avenue/Barber Boulevard/Long John Silver
     ·   Need crosswalks and pedestrian signal heads
     ·   Consider a parallel street to Russ Avenue to allow for one-way traffic northbound and
         southbound
     ·   Improve aesthetics and bury utilities underground
     ·   Do not need bicycle or pedestrian facilities
     ·   Construct a bridge over the creek to connect the Bi-Lo and the Staples/Sears shopping
         centers

B.       2nd Public Workshop

The 2nd Public Workshop was held on October 8, 2009 at the Waynesville Recreation Center,
from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm. Invitations to the public meeting were mailed to the residents in the
project vicinity. A news article was also posted in the local newspaper to notify the public of
the time and date of the meeting. A total of twenty-six (26) citizens signed the attendance form
                      nd
at the door for the 2 public session. The purpose of this informational workshop was to
present the some alternatives to the citizens based on their comments from the previous public
workshop and gather input on which should be the preferred alternative.
                                                                                      Russ Avenue
                                                                                     Corridor Study
                                                                                           Page 14

                                The Project Team discussed project details with each citizen who
                                attended, explaining the planning process and soliciting
                                comments. Project maps illustrating the all potential alternatives
                                were provided to help the public visualize the changes.
                                Comment sheets were available for input from the meeting.

                                A total of twelve (12) comments were received as a result of the
                                public workshop and of those, seven (7) noted that overall they
                                like the Russ Avenue Corridor Plan.

                                A summary of the Public Workshops and written comments
                                received from both of the Public Workshops are included in
                                Appendix C.



V. TRAFFIC VOLUMES
A.   Existing Traffic Volumes

To aid in determining the level of service of current traffic operations, morning (7-9 am) and
afternoon (4-6pm) peak hour traffic counts were provided by WSA at the following locations:

¾ Russ Avenue / US 23/74 Southbound               ¾ Russ Avenue / Border Street (Shopping
  Ramps                                             Center Access)
¾ Russ Avenue / US 23/74 Northbound               ¾ Russ Avenue / Waynesville Plaza
  Ramps                                             (Shopping Center Access)
¾ Russ Avenue / North Frazier Street              ¾ Russ Avenue / Lee Street
¾ Russ Avenue / Betsy Acres Lane                  ¾ Russ Avenue / West Marshall Street
¾ Russ Avenue / Barber Boulevard                  ¾ Russ Avenue / Walnut Street
¾ Russ Avenue / Dellwood Road/Howell
  Mill Road

Existing morning and afternoon peak hour traffic counts are shown on Figure 3. Raw count
data is included in Appendix A.

B.   2030 No-Build Traffic Volumes

No-build traffic volumes are the volumes expected along the corridor if no roadway
improvements are developed. Long-range traffic volumes forecasts are typically developed by
utilizing a regional travel demand model. Since the updated 2030 traffic forecast model
prepared by the French Broad River MPO was not completed during the time of this study, an
annual growth rate was applied to the base 2008 traffic volumes to forecast future 2030 traffic
volumes. Based on historic traffic trends, a 2.0% per year growth rate was applied to the base
2008 traffic volumes within the study area to estimate the projected 2030 traffic volumes to be
used in the analysis of this study.

2030 No-Build morning and afternoon peak hour traffic counts are shown on Figure 4.
                                                                                        Russ Avenue
                                                                                       Corridor Study
                                                                                             Page 15

C.   2030 Buildout Traffic Volumes

The 2030 Buildout Traffic Volumes were determined utilizing the alternatives roadway
alignments developed as part of this study. Specifically, these volumes were developed by
rerouting the 2030 No-Build traffic volumes along Russ Avenue to new connectors between
Waynesville Plaza and Howell Mill Road, and between Barber Boulevard and Frazier Street.
The distribution percentages were determined from current traffic volumes accessing these
roadways from either the north or southbound direction on Russ Avenue. Twenty percent of
the through traffic along Russ Avenue between Waynesville Plaza and Howell Mill Road was
redistributed to the Waynesville Plaza / Howell Mill Road connector. Forty percent of the
through traffic along Russ Avenue in the northbound direction between Barber Boulevard and
Frazier Street was redistributed to the Barber Street / Frazier Street connector.

The re-distribution percentages are illustrated on Figure 5. The final 2030 Buildout morning
and afternoon peak hour traffic volumes are illustrated on Figures 6 and 7.


VI. CAPACITY ANALYSES

A.   Level of Service Calculations
The study area intersections were analyzed using the methods outlined in the Highway
Capacity Manual3 and Synchro Version 7.0 Software. The Highway Capacity Manual defines
capacity as "the maximum rate of flow at which persons or vehicles can be reasonably expected
to traverse a point or uniform section of a lane or roadway during a specified time period under
prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions, usually expressed as vehicles per hour or
persons per hour".

Level of service (LOS) is a term used to represent different traffic conditions, and is defined as a
"qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream, and their
perception by motorist/or passengers". Level of Service varies from Level A, representing free
flow, to Level F where traffic breakdown conditions are evident. Level B represents good
progression with minimal congestion. At Level C, the number of vehicles stopping is
significant, although many still pass through the intersection without stopping. Level D
represents more congestion, but the overall operations are acceptable. At Level E, freedom to
maneuver within the traffic stream is extremely difficult with driver frustration being generally
high.

For signalized intersections, service levels pertain to each approach as well as an overall value.
The unsignalized intersection analysis method in the Highway Capacity Manual assigns LOS
values for each movement that yields the right-of-way, but not to the overall intersection. This
movement is generally a secondary movement from a minor street. At an unsignalized
intersection, the primary traffic on the main roadway is virtually uninterrupted. Therefore, the
overall level of service is usually much greater than what is represented by the results of the
minor street movements. Synchro Version 7.0 will calculate an amount of delay for the overall
intersection, but will not assign a LOS value.
                                                                                                               Russ Avenue
                                                                                                              Corridor Study
                                                                                                                    Page 21

Generally, Level of Service D is considered acceptable for signalized intersections in suburban
areas during peak periods. With the current method of reporting levels of service for
unsignalized intersections, it is not uncommon for some of the minor street movements to be
operating at a LOS F during the peak hours.

Table 1 presents criteria of each level of service as indicated in the Highway Capacity Manual3.

Synchro Version 7.0 calculates the level of service and delay for each intersection using methods
outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual3. Table 2 summarizes the capacity analyses.
                                                                                       Russ Avenue
                                                                                      Corridor Study
                                                                                            Page 22

B. Existing Conditions
Existing levels of service were calculated for the study area intersections using the existing lane
configurations and signal timings. With the exception of Barber Boulevard in the PM peak
hour, there were no major capacity problems identified in the study area. The poor level-of-
service at Barber Road was expected, as a high number of accidents were reported at this
intersection in 2006 and 2007. The 2008 AM and PM existing conditions capacity analyses
results for the Russ Avenue corridor is included in Table 2.

Not included in the capacity analysis is the effect of the multiple driveways along Russ Avenue.
These driveways serve to increase congestion, lowering level of service and decreasing safety.
The five-lane undivided cross section with continuous two-way left turn lane coupled with the
multiple driveways has a dramatic effect on traffic operations due to the absence of any access
control.

C. 2030 No-Build Conditions
Most major intersections in the project area are expected to continue operating at acceptable
LOS during the 2030 AM & PM No-Build Scenario. However the LOS did worsen the
unacceptable LOS at the Russ Avenue intersections with Barber Boulevard, Dellwood Road /
Howell Mill Road (in the PM peak), and US 23/74 Northbound ramp (in the PM peak, in the
westbound approach). The 2030 No-Build Scenario Condition analyses results for the AM &
PM peak hours for the Russ Avenue corridor is included in Table 2.

As with the existing conditions, the five-lane undivided cross section with continuous two-way
left turn lane coupled with the multiple driveways will continue to cause increased traffic
congestion and decreased safety as through and turning movement volumes grow in the study
area.

D. 2030 Buildout Conditions
The 2030 Buildout Conditions assumes the redistribution of some of the through volumes on
Russ Avenue to connectors between Waynesville Plaza and Howell Mill Road and between
Barber Boulevard and Frazier Street, in order to alleviate some of the congestion at these
intersections along the Russ Avenue corridor. The 2030 Buildout Condition capacity analyses
results for the AM and PM peak hours for the study area intersections including the
recommendations developed through the public involvement process are included in Table 2.

This analysis indicates that all study area intersections should operate with a reasonable level of
service and delay in 2030 with the recommended improvements. Additionally, the addition of a
median along Russ Avenue should greatly increase safety and congestion at the driveways
between the major study area intersections.                Appropriate pedestrian and bicycle
accommodations should also encourage multi-modal travel in the area, encouraging people to
leave their vehicle at one location and walk to their destinations, and to walk from some of the
adjacent residential neighborhoods to destinations within the study area.

E. Roundabout

During the public involvement process, questions were raised regarding the feasibility of
removing the traffic signals along Russ Avenue and replacing them with roundabouts. To
address the questions, a roundabout analysis was completed for all the major signalized
intersections along Russ Avenue for the 2030 Buildout conditions. This included: Hwy 23/74
NB ramp; Frazier Street; Barber Boulevard; Dellwood Road/Howell Mill Road; Waynesville
Plaza/Lee Street; West Marshall Street; and Walnut Street. The following table summarizes the
level-of-service and volume to capacity (v/c) ratio if a 2-lane roundabout is constructed at each
of the intersections.

        Note: * Volume to Capacity (v/c) ratio


The table shows that all intersections will operate at acceptable levels-of-service. However, the
v/c ratio for the Russ Avenue / Dellwood Road / Howell Mill Road intersection is projected to
be 1.200 during the PM peak. A v/c ratio over 1.0 indicates that traffic flow is unstable and
excessive delay and queuing is expected. Therefore, the Russ Avenue / Dellwood Road /
Howell Mill Road intersection should not be considered for installation of a roundabout due to
capacity. A v/c ratio less than 0.85 generally indicate that adequate capacity is available and
vehicles are not expected to experience significant queues and delays.
                                                                                     Russ Avenue

Additionally, the Russ Avenue / Walnut Street intersection may not be a candidate for
installation of a roundabout due to the proximity to the railroad bridge on Russ Avenue. All
other intersections could be considered for installation of a 2-lane roundabout; however it could
result in major impacts to properties and businesses due to the size of a 2-lane roundabout.

VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
As discussed previously, the recommendations for the Russ Avenue corridor were developed
through an iterative process involving Town, MPO, and NCDOT staff, and the public. Multiple
options were considered for not only Russ Avenue, but for other roadways and connections
throughout the study area that would alleviate some of the turning movement traffic on Russ
Avenue, and would allow vehicles to travel through the area without utilizing Russ Avenue.
At the end of the process, a variety of improvements are recommended to provide safe and
efficient travel through the area.

The typical section for the Russ Avenue corridor was determined based on the Town of
Waynesville Land Development Articles and Summaries ­ Article VII General Development,
Site and Performance Standards4 using the street design standards for a Boulevard. The
following lists the features of the 4-lane median divided roadway:

   ·   104 ft right-of-way
   ·   8 ft wide sidewalk on both sides
   ·   6 ft grass/planting strip on both sides
   ·   6 ft bicycle lane on both sides

The Recommended Lane Configurations & Traffic Control is shown on Figure 8.

To accommodate for the projected design year 2030 traffic volumes along Russ Avenue, the
following improvements are recommended:

NEW CONNECTOR ROADS
  · Construct a connector road that extends from Frazier Street to the intersection of Russ
     Avenue and Barber Boulevard to form a 4-leg intersection.
  · Construct a connector road from Frazier Street (behind the Shell Gas Station) to Russ
     Avenue where the existing abandoned Long John Silver restaurant sits. This new
     connector road would be located behind McDonalds and CVS.
  · Construct a connector road / back access road to connect the Waffle House, Arby's, and
     Pizza Hut to Barber Boulevard.
  · Construct a connector road / back access road to connect the Sears Shopping Center to
     Howell Mill Road.
  · Construct a bridge over Richland Creek to connect the Sears Shopping Center to
     Marshall Street. This bridge should be of sufficient length to allow for a greenway
     underneath the structure.

BRIDGES
   · Construct a new 5-lane bridge over Richland Creek to allow for northbound and
     southbound left turn lanes. This bridge should be of sufficient length to allow for a
     greenway underneath the structure.
   · Construct a new 5-lane bridge over the rail line to allow for northbound and
     southbound left turn lanes.

RUSS AVENUE
  · Construct a 4-lane landscaped median divided, curb and gutter roadway with turn lanes
     at key intersections.
  · Construct sidewalks along both sides of the roadway.
  · Construct bicycle lanes along both sides of the roadway.

 Frazier Street Intersection
 · Construct a southbound left turn lane on Russ Avenue with 100 feet of storage.
 · Construct an eastbound shared left turn / through lane and a right turn lane with 100
    feet of storage on Frazier Street.
 · Construct a westbound shared left/through/right turn lane on the new Frazier Street
    connector.
 · Construct a traffic signal.

 Barber Boulevard Intersection
 · Construct an eastbound left turn lane with 150 feet of storage a through lane and a right
    turn lane with 100 feet of storage on Barber Boulevard.
 · Construct a westbound left turn lane with 150 feet of storage and shared through/right
    turn lane on Barber Boulevard.
 · Construct a northbound left turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a right turn lane with
    100 feet of storage on Russ Avenue.

IX. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES

The largest improvements in traffic flow, safety, and aesthetics along the Russ Avenue corridor
will result from the construction of a center median throughout the study area. The installation
of this median and associated turn lanes should be the primarily focus for the town within the
corridor. The next steps in the process are to perform an environmental analysis, detailed
roadway design, and permitting. Funding for this analysis, design, and permitting should be
requested from NCDOT and the French Broad River MPO. Funding should also be requested
for construction, although funding for this project may likely be several years away.

The Town should also begin to pursue the construction of the various connections within the
study area that could alleviate congestion along Russ Avenue. These connections can be
designed, permitted, and constructed in a much shorter timeframe than Russ Avenue, and will
provide immediate, but localized benefits.

Pedestrian accommodations should also be considered as opportunities arise, particularly as a
result of new construction or redevelopment of existing parcels. Any future developments
should be required to install pedestrian facilities in conformance with the conceptual designs
included in this plan that connect with adjacent parcels.

                                                                                    Corridor Study
                                                                                          Page 35

A summary of funding and financing options and programs for transportation that have been
used by municipalities in North Carolina is included in Appendix E. This summary was
prepared as part of a collaborative effort with the Regional Transportation alliance and includes
options for public-private partnerships, and existing and potential state and federal programs
and grants.


X. CONCLUSIONS
The Russ Avenue Corridor Study is the initial step in the planning and design process for the
development of a project. The public, Town of Waynesville and the French Broad River
Metropolitan Planning Organization all contributed greatly in the development of a future plan
for the Russ Avenue corridor that can safely and efficiently accommodate all modes of travel
and will enhance the aesthetics of the corridor.

Address: 524 Russ Avenue
Widen Russ Avenue in front of McDonalds and CVS to allow space for removal of the
present island, installation of 3 to 4 high traffic paddles approximately 6 to 8" wide. These
will stop vehicles from crossing southbound lane to turn left out of the McDonalds and allow
enough width to increase left turn lane storage.
Align intersection from CVS across from Barber Boulevard.

I believe Russ Avenue is a destination shopping area and all of the pedestrian improvements
in the world will not cause very many people to walk in this area. It is truly a highway
district.

Address: 99 Pisgah Drive
Intersections- Put in Round-a-bouts for traffic calming, increase carrying capacity, increase
safety, eliminate suicide lane, relieve congestion.
Public Transit- Plan for 5 stops. Now it is only on demand. Within 20 years, we need an
efficient system.
Landscaping-Improves the journey

Address: 228-B Muse Business Park
In reference to your request for "sound off" concerning traffic problems on Russ Avenue in
Waynesville, I hope you will address the fiasco in front of McDonalds and CVS. That
concrete median was a mistake from the gitgo. The turning lane is too short for traffic trying
to make a left turn into the shopping center at Ingle's, Goody's and Belk's. This is causing a
backup on the inside lane of Russ Avenue. I am surprised there have not been more accidents
there.

I have read in the newspaper in the past of City commissioners suggesting planting trees or
concreting the median the length of Russ Avenue. I personally don't see that anything can be
done in the median to solve the growing traffic problem. I am not an engineer but hopefully
you have solutions to the problem.

I was not able to attend the public meeting and was not able to see if this item was brought
up. If so, sorry, if not here goes. Has anyone ever thought of having the 18-wheelers that go
to the paper company on Howell Mill Road only being able to access the paper plant from
exit 104 by the Lowes store? There have been many times I have seen these big rigs turn into
Ingles and take the side road that cuts through to Howell Mill Rd. to miss the light at
Eckerd's Drugs. Now I know the big trucks have to come to the businesses on Russ Avenue,
but it is already congested enough without the trucks going to the paper plant. I have seen the
big trucks almost hit cars trying to make the turn onto Howell Mill Rd. between Maggie's
Galley and Eckerd's. So maybe we could re-route some of these trucks to only exit by Lowes
at exit 104. Don't know if this helps, but it is a suggestion.

I tend to agree with the gentleman from Taylor Ford, this is a major roadway. But we could
have a biking and walkway that parallels the road on one side or the other going through the
side street next to Auto Zone or going into the plazas on the other side instead of putting it
right next to the road. Also it would be very nice if we could build a walking bridge across
the creek from the park behind BiLo to the parking lot of where Antipasto's used to be or
Scooby's now and run the walkway up through that way up near the Laundromat. This way
you could walk all the way from the Rec Center up to Russ Avenue without going near the
main road at Russ Avenue.

My husband and I recently had an errand to run at CVS on Russ Avenue, and were then
going to go to Waffle House (across Russ Ave.) for breakfast, so we decided to park at CVS
and walk across the street. Much to our surprise, there is no crosswalk at that intersection,
even though there is a light there. Needless to say, crosswalks should exist wherever there is
a traffic signal, and one is needed at this location. We literally had to run across the street
(even when the light was red) for fear of being hit by a car.

Make Russ Avenue one way going south, into town. To go north, make the alleys behind
stores one way. That means connecting them and beautifying them, too. Sure, it will cost
money, but it will be worth it. The alleyway can be made to look quaint, with every store
fixing up a quaint back entrance or, if that is not possible, at least fixing up to LOOK like a
quaint back entrance. Murals can be painted on the buildings, as many towns have done,
including Canton. Charleston and New Orleans have these kinds of "alley" streets (like Wall
Street hopes to look?) and they are very attractive. In this way, traffic will be hugely eased
and Russ Avenue and Russ Alley can be an attractive draw to tourists, not to mention a
blessing to residents.

In the future, if any store or restaurant actually on Russ Avenue wants to build or change in
any way, it is imperative our ordinances be observed WITH NO EXCEPTIONS. The
McDonalds in Biltmore is a shining example of what a town can accomplish if it sticks to its
guns and doesn't let big companies scare it by threats of not building there. (Like who cares
if they don't?) Biltmore forced McDonalds to build in keeping with the look of the
area and big, tough McDonalds buckled in when Biltmore stood its ground. Why can't
Waynesville do that?

Instead of a turn-on-arrow-only light, allow those drivers who didn't make arrow time to pull
into intersection and turn when there is a break in oncoming traffic.

Encourage those who do not fit into left turn pocket to continue to the next traffic light, turn
left, and enter Ingles from Howell Mill Road.
The median across from McDonald's is imperative.

The first time I visited Palm Springs, CA I arrived after dusk. The main entry Avenue was
flanked with illuminated palm trees of same height. It looked spectacular. That was thirty
years ago and I haven't forgotten what I felt. Also, the street had underground wiring. Russ
Ave. cannot support sidewalks. Bicycles & pedestrians would possibly be cause for more
accidents. Other towns have laws for fast food chain exposures. Asheville's, Biltmore
location of McDonalds is a fine example. Lots of flowers on display are always appreciated.
Garden Clubs could maintain at no cost to city other than supplying containers. Restrict
future business types, i.e. auto lots, R.V. parks, etc.

I present a couple of items that are intended to be used as considerations, not as final
solutions.

If feasible, determine the counts of through traffic on Russ Avenue, and Howell
Mill/Dellwood Roads. Based on that, consider possibility of inside lanes both directions as
through-only lanes.

Consider alternative primary entry/egress on Howell Mill for the Ingles Center - or perhaps
only northbound entry/exit from Russ/US276 for Ingles.

Whatever is done, do both projects at the same time (Russ and Howell Mill).

Study aerial/topo maps/photos to see if there is any 'otherwise unusable' property that might
serve as a feeder or bypass to this corridor - perhaps involving a new ramp onto 23/74
eastbound (east of exit 102b).

The problem of congestion could be solved if Russ Avenue is made one way, going south,
coming into town from 19/23. The opposite direction of going north, out of town, could also
be solved by forming connections between the backs of the stores and buildings on Russ
Avenue and building an attractive "alley" throughway. Other cities have built quaint,
attractive alley streets, i.e. Charleston. Right now, the backs of buildings on Russ Avenue
feature garbage collection, debris and general ugliness. Let's connect all these buildings,
make the alley street one way and fix it up to be charming, instead of alarming!

Here is my suggestion: bury the cables, remove the power poles! Where I used to live in
California the neighborhoods which had buried services looked SOOOOO much better than
poles and power lines hanging all over the place.

I enjoyed talking about Waynesville yesterday. I have listed below several items that I feel
are issues with Russ Ave. I am a retired engineer and will attempt to be objective with
practical solutions where possible.

Top priority should be to return Russ Ave in front of CVS, McDonald's, and the Ingles
Traffic light to the original configuration. The current condition is an abomination. Remove
the concrete filled left-turn lane returning this to an active left-turn lane. THE CONCRETE
FILLED LEFT-TURN LANE IS WASTED SPACE IN AN AREA THAT NEEDS ALL
THE ROADWAY AVAILABLE. Allow outbound Russ Ave traffic to make left-turns into
the entrance driveways of McDonald's and CVS. Outbound cars on Russ Ave will make a U-
Turn creating a traffic hazard and unnecessary additional in-bound traffic congestion with the
present abomination.

Modify the existing traffic light and intersection at the entrance into the Ingles parking areas.
Buy or seize the old John Silver restaurant and fix this intersection now. A new business at
this location will only make a bad situation worse. The property is needed to correct the
intersection in front of this property.

Consider creating streets parallel to Russ Ave on both sides of Russ Ave behind the current
businesses. Provide a walking and traffic bridge across the creek connecting the Bi-Lo and
Staples/Sears shopping areas.

Eliminate at least one traffic light on Russ Ave. Several intersections could handle a traffic
circle.

Russ Ave should consider moving traffic the major issue. Foot traffic is at a minimum and
will always be small. Why? Lack of nearby high population areas and Americans do not walk
to shopping or restaurants.

My comments concerning Russ Avenue in Waynesville are to build two roads either side of
Russ Avenue, behind all the businesses, parallel to Russ Avenue. I don't mean connecting
the back parking lots, I mean an actual road so that people who want to stop at the businesses
can turn into them and Russ Avenue can become a thru street with right turns ONLY. This
would divert a lot of traffic off Russ Avenue and still allow access to the businesses as
needed. In fact, the roads in back of the businesses "might" be one way north and the other
one way South to keep the traffic moving and lessen the chance for accidents. If you wanted
to go the opposite direction of the one way roads, you could go turn out onto Russ Avenue.

Address traffic flow. Bad back ups on Friday. Safety issue for pedestrians crossing Russ
Avenue. Trees planted by City along Russ Avenue are now blocking visibility of businesses
facing Russ Avenue.

I am a part time resident of Waynesville and I have been reading about the current planning
process related to pedestrian walkways, especially on Russ Ave. I would like to make a few
comments about this subject. I have been coming here every summer since 1997 or so and
have a lot of experience here during the May to late-October time period and I suspect this is
the most likely time that people will be walking around this town.

I love the idea of making specific areas readily and safely accessible to pedestrians but I
disagree with trying to do this on Russ Avenue. I have enough trouble trying to negotiate
this area safely in my truck when I go over there to Ingles, Bi-Lo, the Ford dealer and the
Town tennis courts. I would never imagine trying to park my pickup and then walk from one
place to another. Basically I go over to shop for groceries, vehicle maintenance and tennis
and I need my vehicle for all this activity. Russ Ave. is a heavy duty shopping and drive-to /
drive-through eating district but it is not intended for "window" shopping. I would never
expect to see people walking around, looking in one shop and then another or sitting at a
sidewalk table enjoying a lunch, etc. This is a major 5-6 lane artery with tons of access
points where drivers panic as they try to shoot out into the flow. You cannot add pedestrians
to this mix with 1 and 2-ton vehicles. I am totally opposed to the concept of or spending any
funds on a pedestrian walkway in Russ Ave. area.

               Russ Avenue Corridor Study Public Workshop

Background:
The Town of Waynesville and the French Broad River Metropolitan Planning
Organization have initiated a study of the Russ Avenue / US 276 corridor in Waynesville
extending from the Smoky Mountain Expressway (US 23-74) southward to its
intersection with Walnut Avenue, a distance of approximately 0.8 mile.

Russ Avenue serves as the major eastern gateway into Waynesville from the Smoky
Mountains Expressway (US 23-74). As such, the efficiency and attractiveness of the
road shape a great deal of visitors' first impression of the town and the quality of many
residents' everyday lives.

The purpose of the corridor study is to plan future travel demand, intersection
improvements, access configuration and management, median and edge landscaping and
pedestrian, bicycle and public transportation facilities. The project will result in an
improvement plan for Russ Avenue which will enhance vehicular, pedestrian mobility
and safety while providing and aesthetically pleasing gateway into town.

Workshop:
Citizen involvement is an important part of this plan, so a workshop will be held on
Thursday, August 21, 2008 from 5-7 pm at the Town of Waynesville Recreation Center
located at 550 Vance Street.

The purpose of the workshop will be to obtain citizen involvement in the planning
process by providing information to interested citizens and by gathering citizens'
suggestions and comments for improving Russ Avenue.

Citizens not able to attend the workshop but interesting in getting more information about
the plan or in submitting comments may contact either:

9 Likes the Russ Avenue Corridor Plan.

Likes - The parallel roads to Russ Avenue that would run behind the Home Trust Bank on one
side and then behind the Shell Gas Station and McDonalds etc. Very Good!

Dislikes - Not a dislike...a possible oversight. The ability of the residents from Love Lane to be
able to make a left turn onto Russ. There are a number of residents up in that area. Would there
be the possibility to connect another access road to the newly created road that would run behind
the Shell Gas and McDonalds?

Likes - Bridge over creek between Bi-Lo and Sears. Rear access for Pizza Hut and Arby's.

9 Likes the Russ Avenue Corridor Plan.

Likes - Should be safer due to access management. Multi-modal (Bike & Ped).

Dislikes - 6 signals proposed. All but Howell Mill/Dellwood and Walnut Street (due to RR
bridge) could be roundabouts. (2-lane major, 1-lane minor, like Winston-Salem's South Main
Street round-a-bout in Old Salem)

        ·   Greenway should connect to Greenway along Howell Mill to Waynesville Recreation
            Center
        ·   Bridge over Richland should be wide enough for walkers and bicycles.
        ·   Need pedestrian refuge at pedestrian crosswalks
        ·   Doesn't address traffic backup on Dellwood Road. Most of that road us is only 2
            lanes in places still.

Dislikes
       ·   Absence of Pedestrian refuge islands at all crosswalks- this is egregious with
           my town's commitment to build and support a walkable community. Also, the census
           predicts that population growth will be in group over 50 yrs., the very group that
           needs a safe place to walk. Also, there are already folks using motorized wheelchairs
           to get around-folks need a safe place to pause and plan their next move at every
           crosswalk! please be sensitive to folks with mobility challenges
       ·   Absence of roundabouts-we should at least have 2 to provide safe u-turn mov'ts. for
           larger vehicles, I was impressed that Reuben Moore, Division Operations
           Engineer from div 14 NCDOT made a good case for roundabouts. Reuben has
           participated in past workshops about Russ Ave. and he lobbied for roundabouts.
           Reuben is very familiar w other roundabouts in NC, and has the data about design,
           capacity, etc. What happened to the 2 roundabouts on first draft? Bottom line,
           roundabouts reduce town and county cost to law enforcement, and other emergency
           services
       ·   In medians too much concrete, please allow for more landscaping-plans provide a
           better visual aid to keep vehicles off the raised median.

Looks like some good changes may be coming down the pipe for Russ Ave. Shame it could take
up to ten years before any of it takes place as these things are needed now.

Some folks seem to be concerned if a median is put in place and traffic has to go to an
intersection to double back that they will lose business. Not so. I moved from Raleigh and in
some areas that is what the traffic flow is and you just do it. No big deal. They'll get over it and
I don't believe their business will suffer from it.

It was mentioned in the article possibly being able to make a U-Turn at the intersection so as to
double back. If the turn lane will be in the exact same place it is now to make that turn I'm not
sure vehicles can turn in that radius unless some of the sidewalk is taken out on the opposite
side. Just a thought.

"Leave the existing house and put new street between Shell Station and this house." The house
he is referring to is owned by his family and is located at 43 Frazier Street.

9 Likes the Russ Avenue Corridor Plan.

Likes - How the plan allows pedestrian traffic and provides for the integration of green buffer
areas. I also like the implementation of the center median to eliminate the "suicide turns" that
we had in all ingress locations to Russ Avenue. I also like the way the intersections have been
re-designed to be on axis and how all the traffic is unloaded on Russ Avenue in a "controlled"
and organized manner. Great Job!! Now if the State only had the money to move now!!

Dislikes - I am not saying I dislike anything, it will be interesting to see how this plan actually
works with existing topos, especially behind the CVS and McDonalds connection to Frazier
Street. That could get expensive because that is like a 20% grade on the back side going to
Frazier Street.

     Widen Dellwood to accommodate left turn lane
     Consider making this a TIP project
     Develop a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for project improvements

1-26-09 Fred Baker, Public Works Director, Town of Waynesville:
I thought that Mr. Moore's suggestion to consider a flyover bridge possibly at either the Barber Blvd. left turn or
at the Howell Mill intersection was excellent in the event that a multilane roundabout design ran into issues. I
am concerned that there needs to be alternatives to the Howell Mill roundabout due to site constraints and
capacity requirements.

I. Existing and potential traditional local revenue options

I.1 - Transit local options bill of 2009: H 148 (SL 2009-527) Congestion Relief / Intermodal Transport Fund

Summary:

Transit local options legislation, signed by North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue on August 27, 2009, greatly expanded
the breadth of local options for counties, regional transit authorities, and Research Triangle Park to accelerate transit
investments. The legislation also established a state funding framework termed the "Congestion Relief and Intermodal
Transportation 21st Century Fund," although the 2009 passage did not include any actual state-level funding.

Benefits:

Legislation signed in summer 2009 greatly increased existing local empowerment options to fund their multimodal
transportation future.

Implementation process:

All local funding sources require affirmative votes by boards of commissioners, boards of trustees, etc. Furthermore,
sales taxes require additional approvals before placing on the ballot as well as passage of a voter referendum.

Current usage in North Carolina (partial list):

· Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) has implemented a 1/2-cent sales tax to fund their existing bus and light rail
  system
· Triangle Transit has implemented an existing $5 fee to fund their existing regional bus and vanpool system
· Both of these examples were permitted by legislation that was enacted prior to the passage of the 2009 Transit
  Local Options bill.



Current usage in other states (partial list):

Counties in California, Colorado, and several other states have implemented sales taxes to fund transit.

Additional information:

Summary of transit local options permitted in North Carolina under H148:

· 1/2 cent county local option sales tax (Durham, Orange, Wake, Guilford, Forsyth counties only)
   · Requires county commissioner and MPO approval of financial plan developed by regional transit agency
   · Requires county commissioners to request referendum
   · Requires passage of voter referendum
   · Funding to be distributed to county and municipalities by population
· $7 county local option vehicle registration fee (all counties)
   · Requires county commissioner approval, but not referendum
   · Funding provided to counties and municipalities by population, or to regional transit authority by interlocal
      agreement with county
· $3 regional local option vehicle registration fee inflation adjustment for Triangle Transit ($2 until July 1, 2010)
   · Requires approval of regional transit agency and all county commissions, but not referenda
   · Funding provided to regional transit agency
· $0.10 Production and services district property tax increment for Research Triangle Park
   · Requires request from RTP Owners and Tenants advisory committee and approval by both counties
   · Each county levies tax; resources must serve or benefit RTP



    I.2 - County authority referenda, primarily focused on schools: In 2007 appropriations act (H1473, SL 2007-
    323)

Summary:

Local option land transfer tax and local option sales tax revenue options were included in the 2007 appropriations act. A
county may implement a land transfer tax of up to 0.4% (increments of 0.1%), or a sales tax of 0.25%, but not both.
They may be used for any lawful purpose, with the most common focus being education.

Benefits:

This authority provides a potential additional local source of revenue for infrastructure; however, most conversations in
the Triangle have focused on using this possible future resource for education.

Implementation process:

Requires affirmative vote of county commissioners subsequent to passage of a voter referendum. Voters can approve
both referenda, but a county can only implement one source.

Current usage in North Carolina:

· More than 50 of the state's 100 counties have considered county authority referenda since 2007.
· There have been a total of 8 successful sales tax referenda since 2007 out of approximately 50 attempts (some
  counties have had a sales tax referendum more than once). In 2007, voters in Catawba, Martin, Pitt, Sampson,
  and Surry counties passed the sales tax referendum. In 2008, voters in Alexander, Cumberland, and Haywood
  counties passed the sales tax referendum.
· In the Triangle region, Harnett, Johnson, Person, Nash, and Moore counties have all unsuccessfully attempted a
  sales tax referendum. In 2009, voters in Harnett and Lee counties will consider a sales tax referendum.
· There have been zero successful land transfer tax referenda since 2007 out of more than 20 attempts (some
  counties have had a land transfer tax referendum more than once).
· In the Triangle region, Orange, Johnston, Chatham, Harnett, and Moore counties have all unsuccessfully
  attempted a land transfer tax referendum.

I.3 - Highway local option (not yet available in NC; e.g., S 222 Wilmington local option sales tax for congestion
relief)

Overview:

Highway local options for use by municipalities

Benefits:

If S222 or a similar bill were implemented, it would provide an additional local source of revenue for congestion relief.

Implementation process:

If S222 were implemented in current form, it would require affirmative vote of city council subsequent to passage of a
voter referendum to implement a ½-cent sales tax, and would require cost analysis for each project prior to referendum.
Current form includes provision for seven year sunset.

Current usage in North Carolina:

N/A -- S222 is eligible for consideration in the 2010 short session of the NC General Assembly but has not passed either
chamber in its present form.

Current usage in other states (partial list):

Several counties in South Carolina, most notably the York County (adjacent to Charlotte) "Pennies for Progress"
program.

    II. Public-Private Partnership funding and financing methods
II.1 - Overview of public-private partnerships

Introduction:

Public-private partnerships comprise strategies to foster economic development and infrastructure acceleration through
the use of tax-exempt and other public finance programs and vehicles (bonds, tax credits, PDF, SAD, revolving loan
funds). Methods under the umbrella heading of "public-private partnerships" are private investment predicated on public
investment and vice versa.

Traditionally, public-private partnership arrangements (PPP or P3) were primarily focused on major infrastructure
projects. These are contractual agreements formed between a public agency and a private sector entity that allow for
greater private sector participation in the delivery and financing of transportation projects. Expanding the private sector
role allows the public agencies to tap private sector technical, management and financial resources in new ways to
achieve certain public agency objectives such as greater cost and schedule certainty, supplementing in-house staff,
innovative technology applications, specialized expertise or access to private capital.

The private partner can expand its business opportunities in return for assuming the new or expanded responsibilities and
risks.

Benefits:

PPPs provide benefits by allocating the responsibilities to the party ­ either public or private ­ that is best positioned to
control the activity that will produce the desired result. With PPPs, this is accomplished by specifying the roles, risks
and rewards contractually, so as to provide incentives for maximum performance and the flexibility necessary to achieve
the desired results.

The primary benefits of using PPPs to deliver transportation projects include:

·   Expedited completion compared to conventional project delivery methods;
·   Project cost savings;
·   Improved quality and system performance from the use of innovative materials and management techniques;
·   Substitution of private resources and personnel for constrained public resources; and
·   Access to new sources of private capital.

Implementation process:

Public agencies generally determine the scope of a PPP based on their specific transportation needs and policy
objectives. The first step in the process then involves identification of the activities to be included in the procurement.
Traditionally, public transportation owners acquire services through a competitive procurement process for each separate
activity, either on a qualifications basis (for professional services) or low bid basis (for construction and technology).
However, the traditional procurement process is often not conducive to the use of PPP.



II.2 - Project Development Financing (PDF) a/k/a tax increment financing (in other states)

Overview:

Allows financing of public improvements using an increment of future tax revenue generated from development within a
defined district.

Benefits:


                                                              5
Ties financing of public infrastructure to future tax revenue generated by properties benefited from the public improve-
ment. Encourages economic development that would not otherwise happen. Does not impact local government's bond
rating.

Implementation process:

Creation of PDF District can be initiated by private owner or local government. Requires local government to approve
district, establish financing plan, and obtain approval of Local Government Commission. Local government then issues
bonds to pay for improvements.

Current usage in North Carolina:

While authorized by constitional amendment in 2004, only three projects to date have used PDF (Roanoke Rapids,
Woodfin, Buncombe County, and Kannapolis Technology Campus)

External example:

City of Chicago Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Program -- used to promote private investment in blighted areas of the
City, with funds generated by growth in the Equalized Assessed Valuation (EAV) of properties within a designated dis-
trict over a period of 23 years.




                                                            6
II.3 - Synthetic Project Development financing a/k/a synthetic tax increment financing (in other states)

Overview:

Allows financing of public improvements using an increment of future tax revenue generated from development within a
defined district.

Benefits:

Ties financing of public infrastructure to future tax revenue generated by properties benefited from the public
improvement. Encourages economic development that would not otherwise happen. Does not impact local
government's bond rating. Unlike a standard project development financing (PDF) arrangement, a synthetic TIF
arrangement does not require the local government to issue bonds, and does not require Local Government Commission
approval. Developer does not get use of future tax revenue to pay for public improvements unless project produces
additional revenue.

Apart from the more flexible approval process and lack of public debt issuance, synthetic TIF is similar in theory to PDF.
By putting all risk on the developer, synthetic TIF may make more sense in areas where development is more likely to
occur.

Implementation process:

Handled through agreement between developer and local or county government. Private developer borrows money
against future revenue generated by project. Local or county government refunds developer through annual grants,
assuming anticipated tax revenue is generated by project.

Current usage in North Carolina:

Multiple examples in North Carolina, mostly in the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County. North Mecklenburg
commuter rail line is to be funded in part with synthetic TIF. Wake County PDF policy expresses preference for
synthetic TIF over PDF.




                                                            7
II.4 - Special assessment districts (SADs)

Overview:

A Special Assessment District (SAD) is a geographic area in which the market value of real estate is enhanced due to the
influence of a public improvement and in which a tax is apportioned to recover the costs of the public improvement.
Individual special assessment levies may be made only in a Special Assessment District. The SAD is one of two kinds
of geographic areas commonly associated with a special assessment levy.

Benefits:

In 2008, the General Assembly adopted Session Law 2008-165, which authorizes local governments to impose special
assessments to finance the capital costs of many public infrastructure projects. In August of 2009, the General Assembly
amended the SAD enabling legislation to allow SADs to be used for the same types of projects that PDF can be used for.
Additionally, the amendment allowed for the use of SADs to finance renewable energy projects (see SL 2009-525). One
of the more attractive features of SADs is the ability to include finance professional services costs, rights-of-way
purchasing, and up to two years of interest in the amount financed through the SAD.

Although local governments have had the authority to impose special assessments, the recent legislation makes this tool
much more feasible for large projects. The most advantageous provision of the legislation concerns the time period over
which the assessments may be paid. Prior to Session Law 2008-165, property owners within a district were required to
repay the special assessment within ten years. SADs may now be paid in annual installments over a maximum of thirty
years. By providing for an extended amortization period, and thereby making the individual assessments more
affordable, the public infrastructure improvements are now more feasible. Also, under SL 2009-575, the General
Assembly allowed for additional flexibility so that the public bidding requirements need only be complied with if more
than 25% of the cost of a project will be funded using general obligation debt or general revenues.

Implementation process:

Local governments may impose special assessments under this new authority only after first receiving a petition from
owners of property benefited by the project. The petition must be signed by a majority of property owners in an area to
be assessed (representing at least 66 percent of the assessed value of real property to be assessed). Also, the petition
must include a description of the proposed project, an estimate of the project's cost, and an estimate of the portion of the
cost to be assessed against owners of benefited property.

Current usage in North Carolina:

None as of yet

II.5 - Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) or Municipal Services District (MSD)

Overview:

A Municipal Service District (MSD) or a Business Improvement District (collectively called a BID) is a self-taxing
district that uses additional property tax dollars to improve its district such as accelerating transportation and
infrastructure improvement projects. Typically, BIDs are not used to finance major infrastructure improvements based
on the amount of assessment. BIDs are generally used for enhanced public safety, street cleaning, and marketing the
district.

Benefits:

BIDs are funded by a self-imposed and self-regulated ad valorem tax on real and personal properties within the district.

Implementation process:

BIDs are created by a local governing body through a simple majority vote, after development of a map showing the
proposed district, a report showing the proposed district meets the statutory criteria, public notice and a hearing to
consider the merits of creating the BID.

Current usage in North Carolina:

Downtown Raleigh BID, managed by the Downtown Raleigh Alliance
Hillsborough Street BID, administered by the Hillsborough Street Community Service (HSCS) corporation



II.6 - Joint Development Agreements

Overview:

A joint development agreement is generally defined as a real estate development project that involves coordination
among multiple parties to develop sites near transit, usually on publicly-owned land. A joint development
agreement typically involves the financing and development of a project that incorporates both transit facilities and
private development. Such an agreement could include a cost-sharing agreement to pay for transit infrastructure, a
revenue-sharing agreement to divide profits from increased real estate values, or a combination of the two. Cost-
sharing agreements usually involve cooperation to pay for infrastructure that helps to integrate transit with
surrounding development. Revenue-sharing agreements distribute the revenues that result from development among
joint development partners. Examples of revenue-sharing agreements include ground lease revenues, air rights
payments, or in some cases direct participation in rents or other revenues from development.

Benefits:

Similar to TIFs, SADs and CIDs, joint development agreements provide another value capture mechanism to fund
transit without requiring a direct outlay of government funding. However, joint development agreements are more
flexible than the other tools and can be tailored to a particular situation.

Implementation process:

There is no single process for implementing joint development agreements. Typically, they require a public hearing
by the government authority entering the agreement and formal approval by that body. In practice, the transit
authority or local government will issue a Request for Qualifications or Request for Proposal to create interest and
competition for the development rights in a transit area. The RFQ or RFP may be for a single development project
or a system wide proposal.




                                                            9
Current usage in North Carolina:

Cherokee Investment Partners master development agreement with Triangle Transit Authority

Example:

As noted above, Triangle Transit Authority entered into a master development agreement with Cherokee Investment
Partners, which has been viewed as a model around the country. This agreement gives Cherokee the ability to
coordinate transit oriented development at future rail stations, including land owned by Triangle Transit and
additional land purchased by Cherokee. Station development plans would be reviewed by local and state agencies to
ensure that they meet community needs and promote transit use. One of the potential advantages of this approach is
that it means the transit agency or city only needs to issue one RFP. It also provides for a system-wide approach
wherein the development can phase TOD projects to respond to the market. The larger scale of the development
opportunity can also be a way to attract more experienced developer partners.


II.7 - Large-scale public-private partnerships for transportation

Current usage in North Carolina - highways:
North Carolina Turnpike Authority signed a "private development agreement" in April 2009 with the Currituck
Development Group, LLC to perform financial analyses as to the feasibility of a 7-mile long toll bridge over Currituck
Sound.

Current usage in other states:

The 28 Freeway project in Fairfax and Loudoun counties in Virginia is being built under Virginia's Public-Private
Transportation Act, which allows private entities to propose innovative solutions for designing, building, financing and
operating transportation improvements. Virginia DOT will contribute state highway funds, and revenue bonds backed
by proceeds from the Route 28 Tax District will be utilized to finance the balance of the project. Landowners along
Route 28 agreed to pay for improvements to the corridor in 1988 through a special tax district.

III. Existing and potential state and federal programs and grants

III.1 - NC EECBG Block Grants through North Carolina Department of Energy

Overview:

State guidelines should be released in early October. Grants will likely be available for transportation activities that
reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions

III.2 - State Infrastructure Banks (SIBs)
Overview:

Shared financing mechanism created by the state legislature to advance infrastructure projects.

Current usage in North Carolina:

North Carolina has an existing state infrastructure bank. It has not been used as extensively as in some neighboring
states such as South Carolina.

Current usage in other states:

South Carolina

III.3 - Build America Bonds

Overview:

A new type of taxable municipal bonds authorized under the ARRA. There are two types of Build America Bonds,
"Direct Payment" bonds and "Tax Credit" bonds. Direct payment bonds are bonds on which the US Treasury
Department pays state or local government issuers a payment equal to 35 percent of the interest payment which is
intended to lower the issuer's cost of funds. Tax credit bonds are bonds on which the bond holders receive a tax credit
equal to the 35 percent of interest on such bonds. These bonds can not be used for private activity bonds.

III.4 - Status of Federal Surface Transportation Reauthorization Funding and of Federal Highway Trust Fund

Summary:

SAFETEA-LU-expired at end of September 2009. A $450 billion six year bill is being crafted as an eventual successor
to SAFETEA-LU but likely will not pass in 2009. This bill, called the Surface Transportation Authorization Act of
2009, is stuck in committee until a sustainable funding mechanism can be devised. In the interim, SAFETEA-LU has
been extended until mid-December 2009. The program may well be extended for a year or more at 2009 funding levels
($41 billion in 2010 and $20.5 billion in 2011) in an additional continuing resolution which will keep the federal
transportation program operating but not provide additional resources.

If passed, the Surface Transportation Authorization Act of 2009 will provide significant new authority to local
metropolitan planning organizations, (MPOs) under a new Metropolitan Mobility and Access program. This program
would offer funding and financing directly to MPOs with populations over 500,000 with the goal of lowering congestion
in metropolitan areas. MPOs would have to develop a metropolitan mobility plan for approval by the USDOT and carry
out congestion management programs. The bill as currently drafted expands the percentage of surface transportation
funding that is allocated directly to MPOs based on population from 62.5% of the program to 80%.

As a source of funds, federal motor fuel tax will continue to be collected through September 2011 but receipts will not
cover needs. The federal government is looking at an alternative revenue stream related to vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
instead of relying on a tax on fuel. This is neither technically practical nor politically palatable at the present time. There
are test programs being performed in various parts of the country (including Raleigh) to test the concept of VMT instead
of gasoline receipts as source of revenue. Early results indicate that the program can work and is favorably received by
the public. However, technological limitations and political considerations are such that this paradigm shift in how
transit projects are paid for will likely not be ready for at least six years. Instead, it is likely that an increase in the federal
motor fuel tax will be proposed and passed.

An additional $13 billion is anticipated to be needed to keep the Federal Highway Trust Fund solvent through
March 2011.

III.7 - Climate change benefit inventory

Overview:

In anticipation of future federal climate change legislation (e.g., carbon tax, cap-and-trade, etc.) a jurisdiction could begin
compiling estimates of the potential energy and greenhouse gas emission reductions on proposed transportation projects.

Benefits:

Calculating and compiling carbon footprint reductions now -- or at least developing a system or process for doing so -
will simplify potential grant application activity in the future.

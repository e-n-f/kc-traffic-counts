Warrant 3B - Peak Hour

                                The peak hour volume warrant is also intended for application when traffic conditions
                                are such that for one hour of the day minor street traffic suffers undue traffic delay
                                in entering or crossing the main street.

                                The peak hour volume warrant is satisfied when the plotted point representing vehicles
                                per hour on the higher volume minor street for one hour falls above the curve in Figure 4C-3.
                                Figure 4C-4 may be used if the 85th percentile speed of the major street exceeds 40 mph
                                or when the intersection lies within a built-up area of an isolated community having a
                                population less than 10,000.

Warrant 3                              Can                be used because of Peak Hour Delay requirements.
                                                          (see Warrant 3A for more details).

Can the Peak Hour Volume Warrant be used?                                                          Yes

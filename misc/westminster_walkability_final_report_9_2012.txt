I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of this report is to assist the town of Westminster with a Walkability Study.
Walkability is a measure of how friendly an area is for walking. There are many factors that
influence walkability such as the presence of sidewalks or footpaths, roadway and traffic
conditions and safety, accessibility for all users, etc. A walkable community not only benefits
people by providing increased accessibility for walkers, it also has been known to provide health
benefits for its residents, increased social interaction, reduction in crime, an increased sense of
pride and volunteerism.

A study area was developed, which incorporated critical infrastructure locations provided by the
Westminster Planning Department, within the downtown area and a 1000' buffer was placed
around those locations. Data that was collected within the study area included traffic volume,
speed and classification counts, turning movement counts, sidewalks and related sign inventory
as well as public input.

The residents and business owners were invited to participate in a walking audit where they had
the opportunity to walk as a group within the study area and provide their personal experiences
and thoughts regarding how walkable they felt the town is. Topic areas included sidewalks,
roadways, crosswalks, trails, parks and public gathering spots, shade trees and benches, parking
and local attractions. All comments and feedback are provided throughout the document as well
as a more detailed attachment is provided at the conclusion of the report.

Based on the data collected, a recommendations section was included. These recommendations
comprised of sidewalk maintenance and connections, traffic calming measures for speeding and
crosswalk locations, improved roadway striping for school zones, additional and improved
parking, and town policy changes that will incorporate walkability.

II. INTRODUCTION

A walkable community is one that allows residents access to major community elements that are
generally within a 10 minute walking distance. Those community elements may include
shopping centers, town hall, library, post office, and the senior center. The term "Walkability"
refers to how friendly an area is to walking. Factors that make a community walkable include
street connectivity and design, pedestrian features, access for all roadway users (vehicles and
pedestrians), desirable streetscapes, and pedestrian safety features. Being a walkable community
doesn't necessarily refer to only transportation features; aspects like socialization and walking
for exercise can also play a part.

This report will outline the process of how the town of Westminster was evaluated for
walkability as well as providing some recommendations to help boost pedestrian friendliness
within the study area.


III. STUDY PROCESS


   A. Study Area

The study area for this report was determined by the Town of Westminster's Planning
Department and MRPC staff. This area is located within the Westminster town center and
included key community elements such as town hall, public safety building, elementary schools,
parks, religious facilities, library, post office, senior center, shopping centers, banks, restaurants,
etc. A 1,000 foot buffer was placed around these locations (see Map Figure 1). This selected
area was broad enough to incorporate all the key locations and have it be realistic for walkers.



   B. Walking Audit

Once the study area was established, the MRPC and the
Westminster Planning Department led a walking audit of the
study area in downtown Westminster on May 19, 2012 (see
flyer and handout in Appendix A). The walking audit was
conducted to provide an assessment of walkability within
the study area. Participants met in the town hall and walked
north on South Street to Main Street and then traveled west
along Main Street to Brooks Avenue. They then returned
back down Main Street and continued up Academy Hill
Road to the Town Common.                                                Walkability Audit Volunteers, May 19, 2012




Montachusett Regional Planning Commission      6                    Westminster Walkability 2012
During the walkability audit participants were asked to observe the following:

         Sidewalks ­ Are there sidewalks within the study area? Is the width/condition acceptable
         (at least 4 feet wide)? Do they have handicap access ramps at each crossing and
         crosswalk? Are there large cracks, bumps, dips, etc. present?

         Roadways ­ Are the current roadways in good condition? Is speeding a problem? Are
         large trucks an issue? Are drivers able to see pedestrians in crosswalks ­ is there
         adequate sight distance?

         Crosswalks ­ Are the current crosswalks adequate? Do you feel safe while crossing at
         the crosswalks? Are vehicles parked closer than 10 feet to the crosswalks? Are there "no
         parking" zones near crosswalks? Is the striping on the crosswalk visible?

         Trails ­ Are the trails in the area accessible to the study area? Are there guide signs to
         help people navigate to those trails and trail parking areas?

         Parks/Public Gathering spots ­ Are these located nearby? Are they accessible? Is the
         number of parks/gathering spots adequate for the area?

         Shade Trees/Benches ­ Are there sufficient areas to take a rest? Will you be walking in
         the sun most of the time or are their shaded areas to cool off in the summer?

         Parking ­ Is there ample parking available within the study area? Are parked cars a
         problem within the study area? Are their guide signs to show where the parking areas
         are?

         Attractions ­ What are the local attractions or key destinations that you walked pasted
         (ex. library, parks, shops)? Is there a local attraction guide or signs for visitors?

Other questions to consider were:

    1. What are the positive aspects of your walking route?
    2. Would this walk be adequate for a young child, elderly person, or a disabled person?
    3. What would make this area more walkable for all users?
    4. What would encourage more walking in the area? What is missing?
    5. What are the concerns regarding walking within the study area?
    6. Are the neighborhoods in the area considered mixed income? Is there a variety of
       housing types in the area?
    7. Did you see other people out walking within the study area?


After the walking audit was conducted, participants were asked to provide feedback, both
positive and negative, based on their walking experiences. All comments made by the
participants have been documented and included in this report in Appendix B.

Summary of Findings Based Upon Input

The following summarizes a sample of the responses that participants developed regarding the
positives and negatives of walkability for the Westminster study area based on the observation
topics mentioned above.


Sidewalks - Overall, most of the major roadways downtown have sidewalks which are wide and
plowed in the winter. However, there could be improvements made to the areas along Main
Street in front of the Senior Center and pharmacy. There also lacks a sidewalk or walkway
connection to the plaza behind Vincent's Market and Dunkin Donuts as well as on Nichols Street
(Post Office side), Main Street (Westminster Café side) and Eaton Street to the VFW. There
was also concern regarding a potential future development for Senior Housing occurring on
Adams Street where there are currently no sidewalks and the roadway is extremely narrow.
Inconsistent curbing along existing sidewalks was also mentioned as a negative.

Note: A major concern during the walk was a lack of sidewalks along South Street. This issue
will be resolved after a major roadway project is completed in 2013.




        In front of Post Office ­ no sidewalk   In front of Westminster Café- no sidewalk or crosswalk




         Eaton Street- No sidewalk to VFW           Adams Street ­ Narrow roadway without sidewalks


Roadways ­ Main Street is in good condition although there is a problem with speeding due to
the width of the roadway. There is a lack of signage at the entrances to Vincent's Market and
Dunkin Donuts making it confusing for drivers and the large number of curb cuts in that area
makes walking unsafe.

        In front of Dunkin Donuts drive thru       Multiple entrances at Vincent's/Dunkin Donuts



Crosswalks ­ The crosswalks within the study area were in good condition although a few were
faded (reflective crosswalks were preferred by the group). There are a high number of curb cuts
throughout Main Street which creates a dangerous situation for pedestrians. Cars parked too
close to the crosswalks create a sight distance problem for both drivers and pedestrians. Bump
outs and raised crosswalks were recommended to make pedestrians more visible and slowing
vehicles down.




           Crosswalk at Adams Street                       Crosswalk at South Street



Trails ­ There are no known trails mentioned within the study area.


Parks/Public Gathering spots- One of the positive comments that came up at the Walkability
audit is that there is lots to do in downtown Westminster. The playground, basketball courts, ball
fields, Town Common and VFW fields are all within walking distance from the town center.

       Elementary School Playground                             Town Common



Shade Trees/Benches ­ There is a lack of shade trees along Main Street which was considered a
negative aspect of the walking audit. There are at least two benches that were noted along Main
Street as well as eight more that will be installed throughout the town.




            Bench along Main Street               One of the few shade trees along Main Street



Parking ­ It was mentioned that there is not adequate parking available at the athletic fields and
basketball court. A designated municipal lot (other than the town hall parking lot) with parking
signs would be beneficial. Vehicles parking along Main Street are not always appropriate but
painting parking designated spaces in this area would be helpful. There was also confusion as to
the jurisdiction of the roadway and if cars are actually allowed to park on street or not. It turns
out that most of Main Street is MassDOT's jurisdiction and the town would have to
communicate with MassDOT-District 3 as to the parking regulations for that stretch of roadway.


Attractions ­ Most people felt that there were an abundance of attractions and shops in the area.
Many local businesses, restaurants, cafes and parks exist. The study area is also located in the
historic district.

      Traffic volumes along Main Street (Rt. 2A) average 12,300 and then drops significantly to 4,600
      on State Road West (Rt. 2A). The side streets have a much lower volume that range from 900-
      5,800 vehicles per day.

    2. Turning Movement Counts:

Turning Movement counts were conducted at specified intersections within the study area during
the morning and afternoon peak hours. The peak hour times of 7:00-9:00AM and 4:00-6:00PM
were used for each location. (See Appendix D for full turning movement counts) The highest
peak hour, which was the PM peak hour, was used when determining the level of service.

From the TMC data collected, a Level of Service (LOS) analysis was conducted. The LOS of a
roadway traffic facility represents the quality of traffic flow and is used to assess the operation of
that traffic facility. LOS analyses are based on the methods in the Highway Capacity Manual
(2010) (HCM). LOS is defined differently for each type of traffic facility, such as an
unsignalized intersection, signalized intersection, two-lane road, or multi-lane road. For
intersections, the LOS criteria are defined by the average amount of delay experienced by a
vehicle at the intersection due to the traffic controls (i.e., signs or signals). Usually each
approach is assessed independently, since the LOS of the major and minor approaches may differ
greatly. Table 1 summarized the LOS average control delay criteria for intersections controlled
by STOP signs and those controlled by traffic signals.

The following LOS descriptions apply to intersections:
   · LOS A describes operations with little or no delay due to very low major street traffic
       with many acceptable gaps and traffic flows easily.
   · LOS B describes operations where stopped vehicles experience short traffic delays but
       there are still many acceptable gaps in the major street traffic.
   · LOS C describes operations where stopped vehicles experience average traffic delays
       due to less frequent acceptable gaps in the major street traffic.
   · LOS D describes operations where stopped vehicles experience long traffic delays due to
       a limited number of acceptable gaps in the major street traffic.
   · LOS E describes operations where stopped vehicles experience very long traffic delays
       due to a very small number of acceptable gaps in the major street traffic. This level is
       considered by many agencies to be the limit of acceptable delay.
   · LOS F describes operations where stopped vehicles experience extreme traffic delays
       due to virtually no acceptable gaps in the major street traffic. This level, considered to be
       unacceptable to most drivers, often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival flow
       rates exceed the capacity of the intersection.

Analysis at this intersection shows that the vehicles traveling in and out of South Street during
the peak hour (which doesn't reflect the school time peak hours which could be significantly
higher) will have a delay that ranges from 31-50 seconds due to the high number of vehicles
traveling along Main Street.

                     Intersection at Main Street (Rt. 2A) and Academy/Leominster Rd

This intersection has a low number of vehicles coming in and out of Academy/Leominster Road
which helps it to have a LOS of A on the Main Street approach. The D LOS on the minor
approach is due to the high number of vehicles traveling along Main Street during the peak hour.
                           Intersection at Main Street (Rt. 2A) and Bacon Street
                Approach                 Left Turn      Through      Right Turn     Peds    Total    LOS

This is currently a actuated signalized intersection. There is minimal delay on the major
roadway (Route 2A). On Bacon Street the delay is higher due to the signal light and narrow road
width. Cars are not able to create two lanes at the light for left turns and right turns which makes
for right turns on red difficult. Parking on Main Street in this area also prevents cars from going
around those turning left or right onto Bacon Street.

                          Intersection at Main Street (Rt. 2A) and Nichols Street
                Approach                 Left Turn      Through     Right Turn      Peds    Total   LOS
       Main St Rt. 2A ­ Eastbound            6            396          47            1      450      A

At this location it is clearly understood that the east and westbound traffic will have minimal
delay while traveling through the intersection although the minor street approaches will have
quite a bit more delay due to the heavy traffic along Main Street.

                    3. Traffic Speed Data:

                Generally when determining the speed limit for a roadway the 85th percentile speed is used. This
                is considered the speed at or below which most drivers feel safe driving. See Appendix E for
                more detailed speed count information. The speed data that was collected was done so during the
                last week of school before summer break. This could affect the speeds during school hours
                which we used as between 7:00am and 3:00pm.

                The traffic along this stretch of roadway seem to be traveling at an acceptable rate of speed. The
                count data shows that the majority of vehicles were traveling at the posted speed limit of 30 mph.


                    4. Traffic Classification Data:
                          · Classification data is based on the FHWA Vehicle Classification Scheme F (see

                Summary: 2.2% of heavy vehicles (3 axle or more).

                It is not surprising that the majority of vehicles traveling along Main Streets are generally cars.
                There are also a fair number of heavy vehicles (2.2%). The large trucks could relate to the

number of businesses along Main Street as well as the Aubuchon Hardware warehouse on West
Main Street.


    5. Crash History

The MRPC has accident data available from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation
(MassDOT) for the years of 2007-2009. All recorded crashes in the study area were mapped in
Map Figure 2. For the town of Westminster there were 40 total crashes recorded within the
study area. Of those 40 reported crashes, zero were reported as fatal injury crashes, 5 were
considered non-fatal injury crashes, and 35 were considered property damage only. Out of the
40 total crashes, none involved a cyclist or pedestrian.

As shown on the map, there are crash clusters at at least three major intersections within the
study area. Those intersections include Main Street/West Main Street, Main Street/Nichols
Street, and Main Street and South Street.


    6. Inventory of Road Facilities

This inventory incorporated all roadways (local streets, collectors, arterials, and highways) and
any pedestrian-related infrastructure that may exist. Data that was collected included sidewalks,
crosswalks, and signage. (See Map Figure 3)

Sidewalks are probably one of the most important aspects of a walkable community. In most
downtown areas, simply walking along the side of the road with traffic is far too dangerous for
most pedestrians. Since the average daily traffic through downtown Westminster is 12,300 it is
imperative that sidewalks exist and are in good condition to accommodate pedestrians of all ages
and abilities.

MRPC staff rated each existing sidewalk as good, fair and poor. Locations that did not currently
have a sidewalk were also inventoried.

Sidewalk analysis was based on the following-


        1. Adequate Width

All existing sidewalks were observed and analyzed to see if there is an adequate width to
accommodate all roadway users The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that
sidewalks be at least five feet in width.




Montachusett Regional Planning Commission    15                  Westminster Walkability 2012
2. Obstructions

Obstructions that were observed in this study included utility poles, drainage culverts, fire
hydrants, vegetation, signs, etc. These items were noted if they obstructed more than 25% of the
width of the sidewalk and would be impassible by a wheelchair.


        3. Sidewalk Ramps/Handicap Access

Sidewalk ramps provide a nice smooth transition from the sidewalk onto the street or parking
area. These ramps are required to meet the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards.
This information can be found in the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) publication,
"Designing Sidewalks and Trails for Access, Part I of II, Review of Existing Guidelines and
Practices" chapter 4. (http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/sidewalks/chap4a.htm)


        4. Sidewalk Surface

The sidewalk surface condition was determined by the percentage of cracking that occurred on
the sidewalk, the smoothness (bumps, dips, depressions) of the sidewalk and the amount of loose
pavement, gravel or sand located on the sidewalk.

The overall Sidewalk Condition Map was created based on all of the safety factors listed above
and was then divided up into three categories:

        Good - Sidewalks that were considered good had safety factors that equaled less than
        25% of the entire sidewalk area.

        Fair - Sidewalks that were considered fair had safety factors that equaled between 25%-
        50% of the entire sidewalk area.

        Poor ­ Sidewalks that were considered poor had safety factors that were greater than 50%
        of the entire sidewalk area.


MRPC staff rated each existing sidewalk as good, fair and poor. Locations that did not currently
have a sidewalk were also inventoried. Within the study area there were sidewalks on 44% of
the roadways. The conditions of those sidewalks were broken down as follows:

        Good - 72%
        Fair - 28%
        Poor - 0%

There are many miles of sidewalk within the study area and a majority of those are in good
condition. Sidewalks are needed along side streets that would connect up to Main Street.

   D. Recommendations

When streets and town centers are designed only for cars, they become barriers for pedestrians of
all abilities, who cannot get from point A to point B safely. As a result, many people end up in
their cars, missing out on opportunities for much needed fresh air, socialization and physical
activity.

Based upon the data collected and the analysis conducted, the following Recommendations
resulted: (Numbered recommendations can be referenced as examples on map Figure 4)


    1. Infrastructure Improvements

Sidewalks
   · Relocate all obstacles hindering the travel of pedestrians and people with disabilities
      along the sidewalks (utility poles, trash barrels, signs).
   · Repair all damaged, cracked, chipped and uneven portions of the existing sidewalks (#1).
   · Continue the sidewalk up Academy Hill Road to the common (#2).
   · Continue to maintain existing sidewalks, keeping them free of debris, vegetation, snow,
      etc.
   · Mandate sidewalks in all developments, and bicycle lanes where appropriate.


Crosswalks
   · Consider traffic calming techniques such as road narrowing or adding bump outs at major
      crosswalk locations along Main Street (#3).
   · Place "No Parking" signs for areas within 10 feet of a crosswalk or driveway.
   · Keep crosswalk striping bright and visible year round (#4).



Roadways
   · Re-align the intersection of Main Street and South Street/Academy (this is being done
     currently)
   · Provide designated parking spaces along Main Street (#5).
   · Consider turning lanes along Main Street for dangerous areas (Dunkin Donuts, Bacon
     Street, and Nichols Street) to prevent drivers from dangerously pulling around left
     turning vehicles (#6).
   · Consider Bike Lanes (#7).
   · Reduce the number of curb cuts along Main Street by providing designated channelized
     entrance/exit areas for shopping plazas (#8 Figure 4-B).
   · Clear away vegetation and obstructions to allow improved sight distance at all
     intersections and driveway entrances and exits
   · Add/improve stripping and signage within the school zones to improve safety for children
     walking to school (#9).



Montachusett Regional Planning Commission   17                  Westminster Walkability 2012
    ·   Warning signs look great and should continue to be placed and maintained in the school
        area to warn all drivers of pedestrians, cyclists and children. Placement of all regulatory
        and guidance signs should conform to guidelines established by Massachusetts
        Department of Transportation (MassDOT) ­ Highway Division and the "Manual on
        Uniform Traffic Control Devices" (MUTCD).


Other
   ·    Provide and maintain pedestrian lighting.
   ·    Pursue the idea of having trash barrels located next to major businesses.
   ·    Study the placement of parking for future businesses along Main Street.
   ·    Municipal parking lot locations should be considered.
   ·    Changes to town policy that would be geared toward a more walkable community (ex.
        new business development regulations that would put a store front closer to the street and
        parking areas would be in the back. This creates a safer connection for pedestrians)
        More information regarding this can be found on the Complete Streets website
        (www.completestreets.org).

What to look for while conducting a Walkability Audit: 
 

Sidewalks ­ Are there sidewalks within the study area?  Is the width/condition acceptable (at 
least 4 feet wide)?  Do they have handicap access ramps at each crossing & crosswalk?  Are 
there large cracks, bumps, dips, etc. present?    

Roadways ­ Are the current roadways in good condition?  Is speeding a problem?  Are large 
trucks an issue?  Are drivers able to see pedestrians in crosswalks ­ is there adequate sight 
distance? 

Crosswalks ­ Are the current crosswalks adequate?  Do you feel safe while crossing at the 
crosswalks? Are vehicles parked closer than 10 feet to the crosswalks? Are there no parking 
zones near crosswalks? Is the striping on the crosswalk visible? 

Trails ­ Are the trails in the area accessible to the study area?  Are there guide signs to help 
people navigate to those trails & trail parking areas? 

Parks/Public Gathering spots ­ Are these located nearby?  Are they accessible?  Is the number 
of parks/gathering spots adequate for the area? 

Shade Trees/Benches ­ Are there sufficient areas to take a rest?  Will you be walking in the sun 
most of the time or are their shaded areas to cool off in the summer? 

Parking ­ Is there ample parking available within the study area?  Are parked cars a problem 
within the study area?  Are their guide signs to show where the parking areas are? 

Attractions ­ What are the local attractions or key destinations that you walked by?  (ex. 
library, parks, shops) Is there a local attraction guide or signs for visitors? 

 

Other questions to consider 

    1. What are the positive aspects of your walking route? 
    2. Would this walk be adequate for a young child, elderly person, or a disabled person? 
    3. What would make this area more walkable for all users? 
    4. What would encourage more walking in the area?  What's missing? 
    5. What are the concerns regarding walking within the study area? 
    6. Are the neighborhoods in the area considered mixed income?  Is there a variety of 
       housing types in the area? 
    7. Did you see other people out walking within the study area?

    14. Existing benches to sit down 

Negatives & Issues 
(Numbers 1 7 are listed by priority from the stars on the poster board) 

    1.  Lacking trees/shaded areas 
    2.  Main Street is too wide which causes speeding 
    3.  Signs to warn drivers are needed, traffic calming 
    4.  Move athletic fields out of the downtown (ex. Move to Hagar Park) 
    5.  No pedestrian access to the Joseph's Bistro plaza 
    6.  Inconsistent curbing along sidewalks 
    7.  Too many curb cuts near Vincent's Market & Dunkin Donuts.  Wide open areas make 
        more conflict points for drivers and pedestrians 
    8. Sidewalks needed on both sides of Main Street from Nichols St to State Road West 
    9. Sidewalks needed on south side of Nichols street from Main Street to the Post Office  
    10. Parking too close to crosswalks ­ no buffer 
    11. Bump outs along crosswalks may help slow vehicles 
    12. Municipal parking lot needed 
13. Parking for athletic fields needed  
14. Cars parked on roadside create blind spots  
15. No trash barrels available within the study area (except town common) ­ Discussion 
    about asking businesses to provide trash & recycling bins outside their establishments 
16. Obstructions on sidewalks (utility poles, mail boxes, residents trash barrels) 
17. No designated parking spaces (lines) along Main Street 
18. Concerns regarding "No Parking" signs that appeared on Main Street ­ No one seems to 
    know where they came from... 
19. Turning lanes into businesses (ie. Dunkin Donuts) would be helpful 
20. Sidewalks in poor condition in front of the Senior Center & Pharmacy 
21. Crosswalk needed at the Westminster Café plaza 
22. Reflective crosswalks are needed 
23. Sidewalks needed to VFW/fields 
24. Lack of planning for downtown ­ Business should have parking in the back instead of 
    close to the street.

                          Subject:    Comparative Trip Generation Analysis for Proposed McCandless Mixed
                                      Use Development in the City of Milpitas

                          Dear Glenn:

                          In response to your request, TJKM is pleased to provide a trip generation comparison for the
                          proposed McCandless Mixed Use Development at Great Mall Parkway and McCandless Drive in
                          the City of Milpitas. A detailed final traffic impact study dated November 4, 2011 was completed
                          for a proposed mixed use development consisting of a maximum 1,328 residential units on eight
                          parcels, as well as up to 92,000 square feet of commercial retail within the four northernmost
                          parcels closest to Great Mall Parkway. The November traffic study report stated that of the 1,328
                          residential units, 919 would consist of multifamily units within multi-level podium buildings that
                          include ground floor retail on the four northernmost parcels (now known as District 1). The
                          remaining 409 residential units would consist of two- and three-story townhomes on the
                          southernmost parcels (now known as District 2).

                          It is now our understanding that the project size has decreased in terms of the residential unit
                          count in both Districts 1 and 2. Specifically, District 1 would consist of 955 multifamily units and
                          District 2 would consist of 200 townhome units. Commercial retail quantities for the site would
                          not change. The purpose of this letter is to estimate the expected trip generation for the revised
                          project size and determine whether the decrease in residential units from the November traffic
            Pleasanton

                          study would have any differential traffic impacts.

The above expected project trip totals are lower than the trips generated by the proposed project
assumed in the November traffic study that includes 1,328 residential units. In that study, the
project was expected to generate approximately 9,707 daily trips, including 676 a.m. peak hour
trips (194 inbound and 482 outbound), and 872 p.m. peak hour trips (568 inbound, 304 outbound)
after all applicable trip discounts are applied.

            2. Parcels 1 through 4 located in District 1, while Neighborhoods 1 and 2 located in District 2.
            3. The following trip discounts consistent with the TASP and VTA Traffic Analysis Guidelines were applied:
                 a) Parcels 1 through 4 include 13 percent discount for internal trip matching between housing and
                       retail within each individual project parcel.
                 b) Neighborhoods 1 and 2 include 13 percent discount for internal trip matching between housing
                       on Neighborhoods 1 and 2 and retail on Parcels 1 through 4.
                 c) Parcels 1 through 4 include 25 percent retail pass by trip reduction.
                 d) Parcels 1 through 4 and Neighborhoods 1 and 2 include 9 percent fixed-rail reduction for
                       housing due to proximity with VTA Light Rail stations and/or future Montague BART Station.

It is important to note that since the current project proposal is expected to generate fewer trips
than originally reported in the November study, the November study now represents a
conservative (over)estimate of project-generated traffic. Therefore, traffic impacts are accordingly
expected to be reduced based on the current project proposal. Furthermore, it should also be
noted that all transportation improvements recommended in the November study would have the
same effectiveness under the current project proposal.

                  Introduction and Summary

                  Introduction
                  This report presents the results of TJKM's traffic operations analysis for the proposed mixed-use
                  McCandless Development in the City of Milpitas. This proposed project is located along
                  McCandless Drive between Great Mall Parkway and the Penitencia Creek East Channel within the
                  Milpitas Transit Specific Plan Area. Project access is proposed from both Great Mall Parkway and
                  McCandless Drive.

                  The purpose of this traffic analysis is to evaluate the potential traffic operational effects of the
                  proposed project, which consists of a maximum 1,328 residential units on eight parcels and also up
                  to 92,000 square feet of commercial retail within the four northernmost parcels closest to
                  Great Mall Parkway. Of the 1,328 residential units, 919 would consist of multifamily units within
                  multi-level podium buildings that include ground floor retail on the four northernmost parcels. The
                  remaining 409 residential units would consist of two- and three-story townhomes on the
                  southernmost parcels. Figure 1 illustrates the location of the proposed project and its vicinity.
                  Figure 2 shows the proposed McCandless Development site plan.

                  This report includes analysis of five study scenarios and 11 study intersections (nine existing and
                  two project-only) that would potentially be affected by proposed project traffic. For the purposes
                  of this analysis, potential traffic operational effects from the McCandless Development are identified
                  based on established traffic operational thresholds for the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation
                  Authority (VTA) Congestion Management Program (CMP) and the City of Milpitas. For study
                  intersections exceeding these thresholds, transportation improvements are then identified and
                  evaluated for the potential to bring overall level of service (LOS) back within acceptable thresholds.

                  Summary
                  Project Trip Generation
                  The proposed McCandless Development is expected to generate a net of 9,707 daily vehicle trips,
                  including 676 during the a.m. peak hour and 872 during the p.m. peak hour, after applying all
                  applicable trip discounts.
                  Existing Conditions
                  Currently, all study intersections operate at acceptable LOS based on applicable jurisdictional
                  standards during both weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
                  Background Conditions
                  All intersections are expected to continue to meet acceptable LOS standards, with the following
                  exceptions:
                       · I-880 Southbound Ramps / Tasman Drive (LOS F during p.m. peak hour)
                       · I-880 Northbound Ramps / Tasman Drive (LOS F during a.m. peak hour)
                       · Montague Expressway / Great Mall Parkway / E. Capitol Avenue (LOS F during a.m.
                           peak hour)

                  Background plus Project Conditions
                  All intersections are expected to continue operating under acceptable jurisdictional standards as
                  under Background Conditions, with the following exceptions:
                       · I-880 Southbound Ramps / Tasman Drive - LOS F during p.m. peak hour, with increased
                           average delay beyond four seconds. With the prescribed Milpitas Transit Area Specific Plan
                           (TASP) improvement of adding an eastbound right turn lane, service levels are expected to
                           improve to an acceptable LOS E. However, the TASP notes that this improvement may
                           not be feasible due to potential bridge widening costs. City staff have stated that a fair share
                           contribution should be made for future signal timing / traffic management improvements at this
                           intersection.
                       ·    I-880 Northbound Ramps / Tasman Drive (LOS F during a.m. peak hour). However, since
                            average delay during the a.m. peak hour is expected to increase by fewer than four seconds
                            (1.7), the applicable LOS threshold is not exceeded and a transportation improvement
                            would not be required.
                       ·    Great Mall Parkway / S. Abel Street ­ intersection operations are expected to change from
                            LOS D to E with the addition of project traffic during both peak hours. An improvement of
                            adding an eastbound right turn lane and southbound right turn lane is expected to improve
                            operations to LOS D during both peak hours. However, it should be noted that this
                            improvement is not listed as a TASP mitigation and may not be feasible due to the
                            proximity of a residential subdivision in the southwest quadrant.
                       ·    Montague Expressway / Great Mall Parkway / E. Capitol Avenue (LOS F during both peak
                            hours). During the a.m. peak hour, the baseline LOS F condition is expected to continue,
                            with increased average delay beyond four seconds. During the p.m. peak hour, service
                            levels are expected to increase from LOS E to F. The Milpitas TASP Environmental Impact
                            Report (EIR) identified a grade-separated urban interchange as the only feasible improvement
                            at this intersection. However, the EIR states that this improvement is not fully funded.

                  An evaluation of 95th percentile (maximum) queue lengths under Background plus Project
                  Conditions on City roadways directly serving the project site revealed that the following existing
                  turn pockets are expected to have vehicle queues exceeding existing vehicle storage lengths with
                  the addition of project traffic:
                       ·    Great Mall Parkway / McCandless Drive ­ westbound left turn. Extending the current
                            vehicle storage length from 230 to 370 feet is expected to accommodate the maximum
                            expected vehicle queue and can be constructed within the existing Great Mall Parkway
                            median.
                       ·    Montague Expressway / McCandless Drive / Trade Zone Boulevard ­ eastbound left turn.
                            Extending the current vehicle storage length from 200 to 350 feet is expected to
                            accommodate the maximum expected vehicle queue and can be constructed within the
                            existing Montague Expressway median.

                  It should be noted that City staff have also indicated that a fair share contribution should be made in terms
                  of the TASP impact fee and Calaveras Bridge widening impact fee.

                           levels are expected to improve to an acceptable LOS E. However, the TASP indicates this

                           Therefore, no transportation improvements are required.

                           expected to improve operations to LOS D during both peak hours. However, it should be
                           noted that this improvement is not listed as a TASP mitigation and may not be feasible due

                  Level of Service Analysis Methodology

                  Level of service is a qualitative measure that describes operational conditions as they relate to the
                  traffic stream and perceptions by motorists and passengers. The level of service generally describes
                  these conditions in terms of such factors as speed and travel time, delays, freedom to maneuver,
                  traffic interruptions, comfort, convenience and safety. The operational levels of service (LOS) are
                  given letter designations from "A" to "F," with "A" representing the best operating conditions
                  (free-flow) and "F" the worst (severely congested flow with high delays). Intersections generally are
                  the capacity-controlling locations with respect to traffic operations on arterial and collector streets.

                  Signalized Intersections
                  The study intersections under traffic signal control were analyzed using the Highway Capacity
                  Manual 2000 (HCM 2000) Operations Method contained in the standard traffic software Synchro.
                  This methodology determines LOS based on average control delay per vehicle for the overall
                  intersection during peak hour intersection operating conditions. LOS "A" indicates free flow
                  conditions with little or no delay, while LOS "F" indicates jammed conditions with excessive delay
                  and long back-ups. The methodology is described in detail in Appendix A.

                  Unsignalized Intersections
                  The operating conditions at the study intersections with minor stop-controlled approaches
                  (one-way or two-way) were evaluated using the HCM 2000 Unsignalized Methodology, also
                  contained in Synchro. For two-way stop controlled intersections, LOS is based on and reported
                  for the worse of the two minor approaches. For all-way stop controlled intersections, LOS is
                  based on the average control delay experienced on all approaches. The methods rank level of
                  service on an "A" through "F" scale (similar to that used for signalized intersections) to describe
                  travel delay and congestion. The methodologies for unsignalized intersections are also presented in
                  Appendix A.

                  Level of Service Threshold Criteria
                  All study intersections fall within City of Milpitas jurisdiction but are subject to different traffic
                  operational standards depending on whether they are monitored as part of the Santa Clara County
                  Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Congestion Management Program (CMP). CMP and
                  non-CMP standards for the study intersections are described below.
                  Santa Clara County CMP Intersections
                  The intersection operational standard is LOS E for VTA CMP intersections located within the
                  City of Milpitas. Exceedance of this LOS threshold at CMP intersections would occur when the
                  addition of traffic associated with implementation of a proposed project causes:
                       ·    Intersection operations to deteriorate from an acceptable level (LOS E or better) under
                            Background Conditions to an unacceptable level (LOS F); or
                       ·    Exacerbation of unacceptable operations by increasing the average critical delay by more
                            than four (4) seconds and increasing the critical volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio by 0.01 or
                            more at an intersection operating at LOS F under the Current Precise Plan Conditions.
                       ·    An increase in the V/C ratio of 0.01 or more at an intersection with unacceptable LOS F
                            operations when the change in critical delay is negative (i.e., decreases). This can occur if

                  City of Milpitas (Non-CMP) Intersections
                  LOS D is the standard for non-CMP intersections within City of Milpitas jurisdiction. For purposes
                  of this study, the critical minor approach of unsignalized City non-CMP intersections will be
                  evaluated with a LOS D standard. Such intersections exceeding this threshold will be evaluated for
                  potential transportation improvements.
                  Study Traffic Analysis Scenarios
                  The study evaluated traffic operational conditions under the following five (5) analysis scenarios:
                     1. Existing Conditions ­ this scenario is based on existing 2010 roadway conditions and traffic
                         counts collected as part of the ongoing Milpitas Signal Timing Project as directed by City staff.
                     2. Background (Existing plus Approved Project) Conditions ­ this scenario is similar to Existing
                         Conditions, but with the addition of approved project trips identified in the Milpitas Transit
                         Area Specific Plan (TASP) assigned to the study intersections.
                     3. Background plus Proposed Project Conditions ­ this scenario is identical to Background
                         Conditions, but includes additional traffic expected to be generated by the proposed
                         mixed-use McCandless Development, which consists of a maximum 1,328 residential units
                         of varying type and density on eight parcels, as well as approximately 92,000 square feet of
                         commercial retail within the four northernmost parcels closest to Great Mall Parkway.
                     4. Year 2030 Baseline Conditions ­ this scenario estimates Year 2030 traffic conditions based on
                         roadway link traffic volumes and land use projections documented in the Milpitas TASP.
                         Because the TASP traffic analysis analyzes only 2030 roadway link volumes, growth factors
                         based on these link volumes were developed to estimate expected 2030 vehicle turning
                         movement volumes at the study intersections. This scenario assumes background traffic
                         associated with full build of the TASP, but without traffic generated by the proposed
                         McCandless Development.
                     5. Year 2030 plus Proposed Project Conditions - this scenario is identical to Year 2030 Baseline
                         Conditions, but includes additional traffic expected to be generated by the proposed
                         McCandless Development.

                  Study Intersections
                  The study focused on evaluating traffic conditions at 11 study intersections that the proposed
                  project may potentially affect (see Figure 1), selected in consultation with City of Milpitas staff. The
                  study intersections and their associated traffic controls are:
                      1. I-880 Northbound Ramps / Tasman Drive (Signal)
                      2. I-880 Southbound Ramps / Tasman Drive (Signal)
                      3. Great Mall Parkway / S. Abel Street (Signal)
                      4. Great Mall Parkway / S. Main Street (Signal)
                      5. Great Mall Parkway / McCandless Drive (Signal)
                      6. Great Mall Parkway / Centre Pointe Drive (Signal)

                  Existing Conditions

                  Existing Roadway System and Setting
                  Regional access to the proposed McCandless Development site is provided by Interstate 880
                  (I-880), I-680, State Route 237 (SR 237), Montague Expressway, Great Mall Parkway / Tasman Drive,
                  Trade Zone Boulevard and Capitol Avenue. McCandless Drive provides local access to the project
                  site, with a northern connection to Great Mall Parkway at the primary Great Mall entrance and a
                  southern connection to Montague Expressway and Trade Zone Boulevard. The primary facilities
                  providing regional and local access are described in greater detail below.

                  I-880 is a north-south freeway located west of the project site. This freeway extends south to the
                  City of San Jose and north to the City of Oakland. Near the proposed project, the freeway consists
                  of six lanes and provides local interchange connections at Great Mall Parkway / Tasman Drive and
                  Montague Expressway. The I-880/SR 237 interchange is a major interchange to the north that
                  provides additional regional access to northern and western Santa Clara County.

                  I-680 is a north-south freeway located east of the project site. This freeway extends south to the
                  City of San Jose and north to Solano County. Near the project site, the freeway consists of eight
                  mixed-flow lanes. Further north, I-680 consists of six mixed-flow lanes plus a southbound high-
                  occupancy toll (HOT) lane north of Calaveras Boulevard (SR 237). Local interchange connections
                  near the proposed project site are provided at Montague Expressway and Capitol Avenue. I-680
                  southbound is the primary commute direction during the a.m. peak hour, while northbound is the
                  primary commute direction during the p.m. peak hour.

                  Montague Expressway is an east-west, six- to eight-lane divided expressway operating by Santa Clara
                  County, which runs between the U.S. 101 freeway to the east and I-680 to the west. The roadway
                  provides limited access to fronting land uses, with primary access via signalized intersections that
                  include signal timing optimized for expressway traffic progressions. Through the study area,
                  Montague Expressway intermittently includes directional high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes
                  (right side curb lane) during peak periods (westbound during the a.m. commute peak period and
                  eastbound during the p.m. peak period). Montague Expressway connects with I-880 and I-680 via
                  full cloverleaf interchanges.

                  Great Mall Parkway is an east-west, six-lane divided arterial roadway extending from I-880 easterly
                  to Montague Expressway. It forms the northern project site boundary. Great Mall Parkway also
                  bisects the Planning Area. Great Mall Parkway is designated as Tasman Drive west of I-880,
                  providing a connection to the Cities of San Jose, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale. Great Mall Parkway
                  becomes Capitol Avenue east of Montague Expressway, connecting by interchange to I-680 and
                  continuing southerly through the City of San Jose. Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
                  (VTA) light-rail transit (LRT) service is provided along the median of Great Mall Parkway in the
                  project vicinity in an aerial viaduct, stopping near the project site at Great Mall / Main and
                  Montague Stations.

                  Main Street is a north-south, two- to four-lane arterial roadway parallel to Abel Street extending from
                  Railroad Avenue (north of SR 237 / Calaveras Boulevard) south to Montague Expressway. This
                  roadway, located west of the proposed project site, is designated as Oakland Road south of
                  Montague Expressway. Main Street includes two lanes north of Curtis Avenue and four lanes with a
                  two-way left-turn lane and bicycle lanes south of Curtis Avenue.

                                                                                                                          Page 8

                  Abel Street is a north-south, four-lane arterial roadway extending from Milpitas Boulevard
                  (north of SR 237 / Calaveras Boulevard) south to Main Street (south of Great Mall Parkway).
                  This roadway is located west of the proposed project site. The section of Abel Street between
                  Corning and Curtis Avenues includes four travel lanes plus a two-way left-turn lane.

                  Milpitas Boulevard is a north-south, four-lane arterial roadway extending from the Milpitas-Fremont
                  City limit line southerly to Montague Expressway, where it terminates east of the proposed project
                  site. Milpitas Boulevard is designated Warm Springs Boulevard north of the City/County limit.

                  Trade Zone Boulevard is an east-west, four-lane minor arterial roadway located south of the
                  proposed project site. It forms the south leg of the Montague Expressway / McCandless Drive
                  study intersection, providing the southern gateway to the project site.

                  Centre Pointe Drive is a northwest-southeast, two-lane collector roadway connecting Great Mall
                  Parkway with Montague Expressway. The roadway is located immediately east of the proposed
                  project site and forms the south leg of the Great Mall Parkway / Centre Pointe Drive / Mustang
                  Drive intersection, which serves as an entrance to the Great Mall.

                  McCandless Drive is a north-south, two-lane collector roadway that currently includes a two-way
                  left-turn lane through the project area. It will provide primary local project access to Great Mall
                  Parkway and Montague Expressway. The Great Mall Parkway / McCandless Drive intersection
                  provides the primary entrance to the Great Mall.

                  Existing Transit Service
                  The proposed McCandless Development site is very well served by public transportation. The
                  Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), which operates bus and light rail service within
                  Santa Clara County, runs multiple transit routes through the study area. The Great Mall / Main
                  Transit Center (TC) is located within one-quarter mile walking distance of the proposed project
                  site, on the north side of Great Mall Parkway east of Main Street. This multimodal transit hub
                  consists of an elevated light rail transit (LRT) station above Great Mall Parkway, as well as a bus
                  transfer facility and park-and-ride lot located on the northeast corner of the Great Mall Parkway /
                  Main Street intersection. A second LRT station (Montague) is located approximately one-half mile
                  east of the proposed project site and is elevated above Capitol Avenue. No bus or park-and-ride
                  facilities are provided at this second station.

                  The Great Mall / Main TC and project study area are served by VTA bus routes 46, 47, 66, 70, 71,
                  77, 104, 140, 180, 181, and 321, as well as AC Transit route 217. In addition, the Altamont
                  Commuter Express (ACE) Violet Shuttle (Route 831) runs through the study area along Montague
                  Expressway south of the proposed project site. Table I summarizes the destinations, days and hours
                  of operation, and service headways for the bus routes and LRT line.

                  Existing Bicycle Access
                  Bicycle facilities are classified in three ways: off-street paths separated from auto traffic (Class I),
                  on-street striped lanes (Class II), and on-street signed routes in which bicycles share the roadway
                  with other vehicles (Class III). Currently, Class II bicycle lanes are provided on Great Mall Parkway,
                  Main Street, McCandless Drive, and Capitol Avenue south of Trimble Road within the project study
                  area. Presently, there are no Class I bicycle paths or Class II bicycle routes designated within the
                  project study area.

                  Existing Traffic Volumes
                  Traffic Data Service (TDS) collected existing vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian turning movement
                  counts in October 2010 during weekday a.m. and p.m. peak periods (7:00-9:00 a.m. and
                  4:00-6:00 p.m., respectively) at all study intersections except the three intersections along
                  Montague Expressway. For the Montague Expressway study intersections at Trade Zone
                  Boulevard, Great Mall Parkway / E. Capitol Avenue, and S. Milpitas Boulevard, Santa Clara County
                  staff provided existing vehicle turning movement counts that were taken during the p.m. peak hour
                  only in September 2010. Based on discussion with City staff, in order to estimate existing a.m. peak
                  hour turning movement volumes at the Montague intersections, TJKM multiplied the 2010 p.m.
                  peak hour counts at those locations by a ratio of a.m. to p.m. peak hour counts taken in 2005 as
                  part of the Milpitas Transit Area Specific Plan traffic analysis. Peak hour traffic count data sheets for
                  the other eight study intersections are included in Appendix B.

                  Intersection Level of Service Analysis Results (Existing Conditions)
                  Figure 3 shows the existing peak hour intersection vehicle turning movement counts at the study
                  intersections, as well as current lane configurations and traffic controls. Table II summarizes the
                  results of the intersection analysis under Existing Conditions. Detailed LOS calculations are
                  contained in Appendix C. Currently, all study intersections are operating at acceptable LOS during
                  both weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

                  Background (Existing plus Approved Project) Conditions

                  This section details expected traffic conditions at the study intersections under Background
                  Conditions. This analysis scenario is similar to Existing Conditions, but with the addition of vehicle
                  trips generated by approved but not yet constructed projects as identified in the Milpitas Transit
                  Area Specific Plan (TASP). Under this scenario, current land uses on the McCandless Development
                  parcels are assumed. This scenario serves as a baseline for determining any exceedance of LOS
                  thresholds with respect to the expected McCandless Development traffic. Analysis of this scenario
                  is consistent with both City of Milpitas and VTA transportation impact analysis guidelines.

                  Background Development Assumptions and Traffic Estimates
                  Traffic volumes at the study intersections under Background Conditions were estimated by adding
                  approved project trips from the TASP to Existing Conditions (2010) traffic volumes. A list of
                  approved projects within Milpitas city limits is provided in the TASP. Traffic generation expected
                  from Phase 1 of the North San Jose Development Plan is included under this scenario.

                  Vehicle trips from TASP approved projects were assigned according to the trip distribution
                  assumptions contained in the TASP Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) and are shown in
                  Figure 4. These assigned trips were added to Existing Conditions traffic volumes to generate
                  Background Conditions traffic volumes. The resulting turning movement volumes, traffic controls,
                  and lane geometries anticipated for the study intersections under Background Conditions are
                  shown in Figure 5. The intersection traffic controls and lane geometries are based on the
                  anticipated TASP roadway improvements under Background Conditions that are listed below.

                  Background Roadway Network and Improvement Assumptions
                  Under Background Conditions, several transportation improvements are assumed to be in place.
                  According to the 2009 Comprehensive County Expressway Planning Study, Santa Clara County has
                  identified the following improvements for Montague Expressway through the project study area:
                       ·    Convert the HOV lane on the six-lane portion between I-880 and I-680 to mixed-flow
                            operations due to operational and safety problems. This project has been completed.
                       ·    Widen to eight lanes from Mission College to I-680 and to six lanes from I-680 to
                            Park Victoria, including various intersection at-grade improvements and I-880 and I-680
                            interchange work. It is anticipated that right-of-way acquisition would be required to
                            accommodate the proposed roadway widening. A Final Environmental Assessment/Initial
                            Study was adopted in September 2002, and according to the 2009 Expressway Study, this
                            improvement is partially completed and partially funded. It should be noted that the
                            City of Milpitas recently completed widening Montague Expressway to four lanes per
                            direction between Great Mall Parkway and Milpitas Boulevard, which was outside the scope
                            of the County's planned Montague Expressway Improvement Project.

                  In addition, the Milpitas TASP anticipates improvements to the following study intersections:
                       ·    Adding a fourth through lane for the westbound Montague Expressway approach at
                            Milpitas Boulevard. This improvement is considered part of the County's Montague
                            Expressway Improvement Project.
                       ·    At the Montague Expressway / McCandless Drive / Trade Zone Boulevard study intersection,
                            widen the northbound (Trade Zone) approach to accommodate two left turn lanes, one
                            through lane, and one right turn lane. Similarly, widen the southbound (McCandless)
                            approach to accommodate the same configuration as the northbound approach.

                                                                                                                         Page 13

                  Background plus Project Conditions

                  This analysis scenario is similar to Background Conditions, but with the addition of traffic expected
                  to be generated by the proposed McCandless Development.

                  Project Location and Proposal
                  The proposed mixed-use McCandless Development is located within the Transit Specific Plan Area
                  of the City of Milpitas. It is situated on eight parcels located on both sides of McCandless Drive
                  (four on west side and four on east side) between Great Mall Parkway to the north and the
                  Penitencia Creek East Channel to the south. The two northernmost parcels (1 and 3) are proposed
                  to have right-in/right-out access from both Great Mall Parkway and McCandless Drive. Parcel 1
                  would also have full access from the proposed McCandless Drive / Street "A" intersection south of
                  Great Mall Parkway, while Parcel 3 would have one-way outbound (westbound) access on Street "A"
                  between McCandless Drive and the proposed Street "B". Full access for the remaining parcels will
                  be provided from McCandless Drive. Additionally, the proposed Street "B", which would parallel
                  McCandless Drive to the east, will provide a secondary right-in/right-out access from Great Mall
                  Parkway for the four easternmost project parcels.

                  The proposed project consists of a maximum 1,328 residential units on eight parcels, as well as
                  up to 92,000 square feet of commercial retail within the four northernmost parcels closest to
                  Great Mall Parkway. Of the 1,328 residential units, 919 would consist of multifamily units within
                  multi-level podium buildings that include ground floor retail on the four northernmost parcels. The
                  remaining 409 residential units would consist of two- and three-story townhomes on the
                  southernmost parcels.

                  Trip Generation ­ Proposed Project
                  TJKM developed expected trip generation for the proposed project based on San Diego Association
                  of Governments (SANDAG) trip generation rates contained in the Milpitas TASP, as well as
                  residential rates consistent with a recent TASP development traffic study in the Piper-Montague
                  subarea as directed by City staff. Table IV shows the resulting trip rates used for estimating trips
                  expected to be generated by the proposed project.

                              and San Diego Traffic Generators (2002).

                  TJKM applied trip discounts to the proposed project trip generation that are consistent with the
                  Milpitas TASP and VTA Traffic Analysis Guidelines in terms of development densities, residential-
                  retail mixed use internal trip capture, retail pass by, and proximity to rail transit. Table V shows the
                  estimated trip generation for the proposed project resulting from the trip rates in Table IV and
                  applicable trip discounts. As shown in Table V, the proposed McCandless Development is expected
                  to generate a net of 9,707 daily vehicle trips, including 676 during the a.m. peak hour and 872 during
                  the p.m. peak hour, after applying all applicable trip discounts.

                  Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
                  Trip distribution is a process that determines in what proportion vehicles would be expected to
                  travel between a project site and various destinations outside the project study area. The process
                  of trip assignment determines the various routes that vehicles would take from the project site to
                  each destination using the calculated trip distribution.

                  Trip distribution assumptions for the proposed McCandless Development were based on the trip
                  distributions contained in the Milpitas TASP. The assumed distribution percentages are as follows:
                       ·      21 percent to/from from I-880 North
                       ·      15 percent to/from I-680 North
                       ·      15 percent to/from I-680 South
                                                                                                                                  Page 18

                       ·    13 percent to/from I-880 South
                       ·    12 percent to/from Tasman Drive West
                       ·    5 percent to/from S. Milpitas Boulevard North
                       ·    5 percent to/from Oakland Road South
                       ·    3 percent to/from S. Main Street North

                       ·    2 percent to/from Lundy Avenue South

                  Project trips were assigned to the study intersections according to the above trip distribution
                  percentages. Figure 6 shows the proposed project trip distribution percentages and resulting trip
                  assignments at all study intersections. The assigned project trips were then added to Background
                  Conditions traffic volumes to generate Background plus Project traffic volumes. Figure 7 shows the
                  resulting traffic volumes at the study intersections under Background plus Project Conditions. The
                  intersection traffic controls and lane geometries assumed under this analysis scenario are the same
                  as under the Background Conditions analysis scenario.

                  Intersection Level of Service Analysis Results (Background plus Project Conditions)
                  The intersection LOS analysis results for both Background and Background plus Project Conditions
                  are summarized in Table VI. Detailed calculation sheets are contained in Appendix E. All
                  intersections are expected to continue operating acceptably as under Background Conditions, with
                  the following exceptions:
                      · I-880 Southbound Ramps / Tasman Drive - LOS F during p.m. peak hour, with increased
                           average delay beyond four seconds.
                       ·    I-880 Northbound Ramps / Tasman Drive (LOS F during a.m. peak hour). Since average
                            delay during the a.m. peak hour is expected to increase by fewer than four seconds (1.7),
                            the applicable LOS threshold is not exceeded, and no transportation improvement would
                            be required.
                       ·    Great Mall Parkway / S. Abel Street ­ intersection operations are expected to change from
                            LOS D to E with the addition of project traffic during both peak hours.
                       ·    Montague Expressway / Great Mall Parkway / E. Capitol Avenue (LOS F during both peak
                            hours). During the a.m. peak hour, the baseline LOS F condition is expected to continue,
                            with increased average delay beyond four seconds. During the p.m. peak hour, service
                            levels are expected to increase from LOS E to F.

                  Intersection Transportation Improvement Measures (Background plus Project Conditions)
                  To address the above expected service levels exceeding LOS standards, the following
                  transportation improvement measures are expected to be necessary:
                        ·     I-880 Southbound Ramps / Tasman Drive (LOS F during p.m. peak hour). With the prescribed
                              Milpitas TASP improvement of adding an eastbound right turn lane, service levels are expected
                              to improve to an acceptable LOS E. However, it should be noted that the TASP has indicated
                              that this improvement may not be feasible due to potential bridge widening costs. City staff
                              have stated that a fair share contribution should be made for future signal timing / traffic
                              management improvements at this intersection.
                        ·     Great Mall Parkway / S. Abel Street ­ with an improvement of adding one eastbound right
                              turn lane and one southbound right turn lane, service levels are expected to improve to an
                                                                                                                                     Page 20

                             acceptable LOS D during both peak hours. However, this improvement is not likely to be
                             feasible. It should be noted that no improvements for this intersection were identified in
                             the TASP, and this proposed improvement does not modify current signal timing plans at
                             this intersection, which could be another solution to improve LOS to a manageable level
                             without widening. Furthermore, this improvement would require widening two intersection
                             approaches, which is not likely to be feasible due to the proximity of a residential
                             subdivision in the southwest quadrant. It is also important to note that the McCandless
                             Development's expected trip assignments through the intersection would not add to the
                             specific turning movements proposed for additional turn lanes for this improvement.
                       ·     Montague Expressway / Great Mall Parkway / E. Capitol Avenue. The Milpitas TASP EIR identified
                             a grade-separated urban interchange as the only feasible improvement at this intersection.
                             However, it should be noted that according to the EIR, this improvement is not fully funded.

                  It should be noted that City staff have also indicated that a fair share contribution should be made in terms
                  of the TASP impact fee and Calaveras Bridge widening impact fee.

                  lengths for existing turn lanes on City roadways directly serving the project site. The evaluation
                  included analysis of 95th percentile (maximum) queues expected with the addition of proposed
                  project traffic, and results are included in Appendix E. Table VII shows expected vehicle queues for
                  the turn pockets of project access intersections under Background plus Project Conditions. The
                  table shows that the following existing turn pockets are expected to exceed available vehicle
                  storage capacity with the addition of proposed project traffic:

                  The following improvements are recommended to accommodate maximum queues anticipated
                  under Background plus Project Conditions:
                       ·    Great Mall Parkway / McCandless Drive westbound left turn: Extend current vehicle
                            storage length from 230 to 385 feet. The existing Great Mall Parkway median has sufficient
                            length and width to accommodate this improvement.
                       ·    Montague Expressway / McCandless Drive / Trade Zone Boulevard eastbound left turn:
                            Extend current vehicle storage length from 200 to 350 feet. The existing Montague
                            Expressway median has sufficient length and width to accommodate this improvement.

                  Year 2030 Baseline Conditions

                  This section details expected traffic conditions at the study intersections under Year 2030 Baseline
                  Conditions. This scenario estimates Year 2030 traffic conditions based on roadway link traffic
                  volumes and land use projections documented in the Milpitas TASP.

                  Year 2030 Baseline Traffic Estimates
                  TJKM estimated 2030 traffic volumes for the study intersections using 2030 roadway link volume
                  projections from the Milpitas TASP. Since there are no 2030 intersection volumes reported in the
                  TASP DEIR, TJKM developed annual growth factors based on TASP link volume growth between
                  2004 and 2030 on Great Mall Parkway, Montague Expressway, and adjacent study area roadways.
                  These factors were applied proportionately to existing vehicle turning movement volumes at the
                  study intersections to estimate 2030 intersection volumes, which are assumed to include full build
                  of the TASP. It should be noted that this procedure yielded 2030 link volumes that are less than
                  originally projected in the TASP. While the application of annual growth factors assume an annual
                  pace of traffic growth similar to TASP, it is reasonable to assume that 2030 link volumes would now
                  be less than originally projected given the slower pace of development growth under current
                  economic conditions.

                  To estimate 2030 Baseline intersection volumes, vehicle trip assignments from the proposed
                  McCandless Development were subtracted out of the 2030 traffic volumes that assume full build of
                  the Milpitas TASP. The resulting 2030 Baseline analysis scenario thereby provides a traffic
                  operational basis of comparison for the proposed McCandless Development traffic.

                  Year 2030 plus Project Conditions

                  This scenario is similar to Year 2030 Baseline Conditions, but with the addition of traffic generated
                  by the proposed McCandless Development. The assumed roadway network and nearby area
                  development is assumed to be the same under this traffic scenario as for Year 2030 Baseline
                  Conditions.

                  Project Trip Generation, Distribution, and Assignment
                  The expected proposed project trip generation, distribution, and assignment assumed under
                  Year 2030 plus Project Conditions is identical to that assumed under Background plus Project
                  Conditions.

                  Intersection Level of Service Analysis Results (Year 2030 plus Project Conditions)
                  The LOS analysis results for both Year 2030 Baseline and Year 2030 plus Project Conditions are
                  summarized in Table IX. Detailed calculations are contained in Appendix G. All intersections are
                  expected to continue operating acceptably, with the following exceptions:
                       ·    I-880 Southbound Ramps / Tasman Drive - LOS F during p.m. peak hour, just as under
                            2030 Baseline Conditions, but with increased average delay beyond four seconds.
                       ·    I-880 Northbound Ramps / Tasman Drive - LOS F during a.m. peak hour, just as under
                            2030 Baseline Conditions, but with increased average delay by fewer than four seconds.
                            Therefore, no transportation improvement is required.
                       ·    Great Mall Parkway / S. Abel Street - LOS F during a.m. peak hour and LOS E during p.m.
                            peak hour, just as under 2030 Baseline Conditions, but with increased average delay
                            beyond four seconds for the p.m. peak hour.
                       ·    Montague Expressway / Great Mall Parkway / E. Capitol Avenue - LOS F during both peak
                            hours, just as under 2030 Baseline Conditions, but with increased average delay beyond
                            four seconds for both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
                       ·    Montague Expressway / McCandless Drive / Trade Zone Boulevard - LOS F during p.m.
                            peak hour, just as under 2030 Baseline Conditions, but with increased average delay by
                            fewer than four seconds. Therefore, no transportation improvement is required.

                  Intersection Transportation Improvement Measures (Year 2030 plus Project
                  Conditions)
                  To address the above expected service levels exceeding LOS standards, the following
                  transportation improvement measures are expected to be necessary:
                       ·    I-880 Southbound Ramps / Tasman Drive (LOS F during p.m. peak hour). With the prescribed
                            Milpitas TASP improvement of adding an eastbound right turn lane, service levels are expected
                            to improve to an acceptable LOS E. However, it should be noted that the TASP has indicated
                            that this improvement may not be feasible due to potential bridge widening costs. City staff
                            have stated that a fair share contribution should be made for future signal timing / traffic
                            management improvements at this intersection.
                       ·    Great Mall Parkway / S. Abel Street ­ with an improvement of adding one eastbound right
                            turn lane, one southbound right turn lane, and one northbound left turn lane, service levels
                            are expected to improve to an acceptable LOS D during both peak hours. However, this
                            improvement is not likely to be feasible. It should be noted that no improvements for this
                            intersection were identified in the TASP, and this proposed improvement does not modify
                            current signal timing plans at this intersection, which could be another solution to improve
                            LOS to a manageable level without widening. Furthermore, this improvement would
                            require widening two intersection approaches, which is not likely to be feasible due to the
                            proximity of a residential subdivision in the southwest quadrant. It is also important to note
                            that the McCandless Development's expected trip assignments through the intersection
                            would not add to the specific turning movements proposed for additional turn lanes for this
                            improvement.
                       ·    Montague Expressway / Great Mall Parkway / E. Capitol Avenue. The Milpitas TASP EIR
                            identified a grade-separated urban interchange as the only feasible improvement at this
                            intersection. However, it should be noted that according to the EIR, this improvement is not
                            fully funded.

                  It should be noted that City staff have also indicated that a fair share contribution should be made in terms
                  of the TASP impact fee and Calaveras Bridge widening impact fee.

                  Expected Vehicle Queues at City Roadway Access Points
                  TJKM evaluated the potential effects of added traffic from the proposed project on vehicle queue
                  lengths for existing turn lanes on City roadways directly serving the project site. The evaluation
                  included analysis of 95th percentile (maximum) queues expected with the addition of proposed
                  project traffic, and results are included in Appendix G. Table X shows expected vehicle queues for
                  the turn pockets of project access intersections under 2030 plus Project Conditions. The table
                  shows that the following existing turn pockets are expected to exceed available vehicle storage
                  capacity with the addition of proposed project traffic:

                  Conclusions

                  TJKM has reached the following conclusions regarding the proposed mixed-use McCandless
                  Development in the City of Milpitas:

                  Project Trip Generation
                  The proposed McCandless Development is expected to generate a net of 9,707 daily vehicle trips,
                  including 676 during the a.m. peak hour and 872 during the p.m. peak hour, after applying all
                  applicable trip discounts.

                  Existing Conditions
                  Currently, all study intersections operate at acceptable LOS based on applicable jurisdictional
                  standards during both weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

                  Background Conditions
                  All intersections are expected to continue to meet acceptable LOS standards, with the following
                  exceptions:
                       ·    I-880 Southbound Ramps / Tasman Drive (LOS F during p.m. peak hour)
                       ·    I-880 Northbound Ramps / Tasman Drive (LOS F during a.m. peak hour)
                       ·    Montague Expressway / Great Mall Parkway / E. Capitol Avenue (LOS F during a.m. peak hour)

                  Background plus Project Conditions
                       ·    All intersections are expected to continue operating under acceptable jurisdictional
                            standards as under Background Conditions, with the following exceptions:
                              o I-880 Southbound Ramps / Tasman Drive - LOS F during p.m. peak hour, with increased
                                   average delay beyond four seconds. With the prescribed Milpitas Transit Area Specific
                                   Plan (TASP) improvement of adding an eastbound right turn lane, service levels are
                                   expected to improve to an acceptable LOS E. However, the TASP notes that this
                                   improvement may not be feasible due to potential bridge widening costs. City staff have
                                   stated that a fair share contribution should be made for future signal timing / traffic
                                   management improvements at this intersection.
                              o I-880 Northbound Ramps / Tasman Drive (LOS F during a.m. peak hour). However,
                                   since average delay during the a.m. peak hour is expected to increase by fewer than
                                   four seconds (1.7), the applicable LOS threshold is not exceeded and a transportation
                                   improvement would not be required.
                              o Great Mall Parkway / S. Abel Street ­ intersection operations are expected to change
                                   from LOS D to E with the addition of project traffic during both peak hours. An
                                   improvement of adding an eastbound right turn lane and southbound right turn lane is
                                   expected to improve operations to LOS D during both peak hours. However, it
                                   should be noted that this improvement is not listed as a TASP mitigation and may not
                                   be feasible due to the proximity of a residential subdivision in the southwest quadrant.
                              o Montague Expressway / Great Mall Parkway / E. Capitol Avenue (LOS F during both
                                   peak hours). During the a.m. peak hour, the baseline LOS F condition is expected to
                                   continue, with increased average delay beyond four seconds. During the p.m. peak
                                   hour, service levels are expected to increase from LOS E to F. The Milpitas TASP
                                   Environmental Impact Report (EIR) identified a grade-separated urban interchange as
                                   the only feasible improvement at this intersection. However, the EIR states that this
                                   improvement is not fully funded.
                                                                                                                         Page 33

                            Conditions on City roadways directly serving the project site revealed that the following
                            existing turn pockets are expected to have vehicle queues exceeding existing vehicle
                            storage lengths with the addition of project traffic:

                                  vehicle storage length from 230 to 385 feet is expected to accommodate the
                                  maximum expected vehicle queue and can be constructed within the existing Great
                                  Mall Parkway median.
                              o Montague Expressway / McCandless Drive / Trade Zone Boulevard ­ eastbound left
                                  turn. Extending the current vehicle storage length from 200 to 350 feet is expected
                                  to accommodate the maximum expected vehicle queue and can be constructed within
                                  the existing Montague Expressway median.

                  It should be noted that City staff have also indicated that a fair share contribution should be made in terms
                  of the TASP impact fee and Calaveras Bridge widening impact fee.

                             o I-880 Southbound Ramps / Tasman Drive - LOS F during p.m. peak hour, just as under
                                   2030 Baseline Conditions, but with increased average delay beyond four seconds.
                                   With the prescribed Milpitas TASP improvement of adding an eastbound right turn
                                   lane, service levels are expected to improve to an acceptable LOS E. However, this
                                   improvement may not be feasible due to potential bridge widening costs.
                             o I-880 Northbound Ramps / Tasman Drive - LOS F during a.m. peak hour, just as
                                   under 2030 Baseline Conditions, but with increased average delay by fewer than four
                                   seconds. Therefore, no transportation improvements are required.
                             o Great Mall Parkway / S. Abel Street - LOS F during a.m. peak hour and LOS E during
                                   p.m. peak hour, just as under 2030 Baseline Conditions, with increased average delay
                                   greater than four seconds during the p.m. peak hour. An improvement of adding one
                                   eastbound right turn lane, one southbound right turn lane, and one northbound left
                                   turn lane is expected to improve operations to LOS D during both peak hours.
                                   However, it should be noted that this improvement is not listed as a TASP mitigation
                                   and may not be feasible due to the proximity of a residential subdivision in the

                            experience spillover conditions with the addition of project traffic. The same

                            accommodate the maximum queues expected under 2030 plus Project Conditions.

                  It should be noted that City staff have also indicated that a fair share contribution should be made
                  in terms of the TASP impact fee and Calaveras Bridge widening impact fee.

                                         LEVEL OF SERVICE

The description and procedures for calculating capacity and level of service (LOS) are found in
Transportation Research Board, Highway Capacity Manual 2000. Highway Capacity Manual 2000
represents the latest research on capacity and quality of service for transportation facilities.

Quality of service requires quantitative measures to characterize operational conditions within a traffic
stream. LOS is a quality measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally in
terms of such service measures as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and
comfort and convenience.

Six levels of service are defined for each type of facility that has analysis procedures available. Letters
designate each level, from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F the
worst. Each LOS represents a range of operating conditions and the driver's perception of these
conditions. Safety is not included in the measures that establish service levels.

A general description of service levels for various types of facilities is shown in Table A-I

Urban Streets
The term "urban streets" refers to urban arterials and collectors, including those in downtown areas.

Arterial streets are roads that primarily serve longer through trips. However, providing access to
abutting commercial and residential land uses is also an important function of arterials.
Collector streets provide both land access and traffic circulation within residential, commercial and
industrial areas. Their access function is more important than that of arterials, and unlike arterials their
operation is not always dominated by traffic signals.

Downtown streets are signalized facilities that often resemble arterials. They not only move through
traffic but also provide access to local businesses for passenger cars, transit buses, and trucks.
Pedestrian conflicts and lane obstructions created by stopping or standing buses, trucks and parking
vehicles that cause turbulence in the traffic flow are typical of downtown streets.

The speed of vehicles on urban streets is influenced by three main factors, street environment,
interaction among vehicles and traffic control. As a result, these factors also affect quality of service.

The street environment includes the geometric characteristics of the facility, the character of roadside
activity and adjacent land uses. Thus, the environment reflects the number and width of lanes, type of
median, driveway density, spacing between signalized intersections, existence of parking, level of
pedestrian activity and speed limit.

The interaction among vehicles is determined by traffic density, the proportion of trucks and buses, and
turning movements. This interaction affects the operation of vehicles at intersections and, to a lesser
extent, between signals.

Traffic control (including signals and signs) forces a portion of all vehicles to slow or stop. The delays
and speed changes caused by traffic control devices reduce vehicle speeds, however, such controls are
needed to establish right-of-way.

The average travel speed for through vehicles along an urban street is the determinant of the operating
LOS. The travel speed along a segment, section or entire length of an urban street is dependent on the
running speed between signalized intersections and the amount of control delay incurred at signalized
intersections.

LOS A describes primarily free-flow operations. Vehicles are completely unimpeded in their ability to
maneuver within the traffic stream. Control delay at signalized intersections is minimal.

LOS B describes reasonably unimpeded operations. The ability to maneuver within the traffic stream is
only slightly restricted, and control delays at signalized intersections are not significant.

LOS C describes stable operations, however, ability to maneuver and change lanes in midblock location
may be more restricted than at LOS B. Longer queues, adverse signal coordination, or both may
contribute to lower travel speeds.

LOS D borders on a range in which in which small increases in flow may cause substantial increases in
delay and decreases in travel speed. LOS D may be due to adverse signal progression, inappropriate
signal timing, high volumes, or a combination of these factors.

LOS E is characterized by significant delays and lower travel speeds. Such operations are caused by a
combination of adverse progression, high signal density, high volumes, extensive delays at critical
intersections, and inappropriate signal timing.

LOS F is characterized by urban street flow at extremely low speeds. Intersection congestion is likely at
critical signalized locations, with high delays, high volumes, and extensive queuing.

The methodology to determine LOS stratifies urban streets into four classifications. The classifications
are complex, and are related to functional and design categories. Table A-II describes the functional and
design categories, while Table A-III relates these to the urban street classification.
Once classified, the urban street is divided into segments for analysis. An urban street segment is a
one-way section of street encompassing a series of blocks or links terminating at a signalized
intersection. Adjacent segments of urban streets may be combined to form larger street sections,
provided that the segments have similar demand flows and characteristics.

Levels of service are related to the average travel speed of vehicles along the urban street segment or
section.

Travel times for existing conditions are obtained by field measurements. The maximum-car technique is
used. The vehicle is driven at the posted speed limit unless impeded by actual traffic conditions. In the
maximum-car technique, a safe level of vehicular operation is maintained by observing proper following
distances and by changing speeds at reasonable rates of acceleration and deceleration. The maximum-
car technique provides the best base for measuring traffic performance.

An observer records the travel time and locations and duration of delay. The beginning and ending
points are the centers of intersections. Delays include times waiting in queues at signalized
intersections. The travel speed is determined by dividing the length of the segment by the travel time.
Once the travel speed on the arterial is determined, the LOS is found by comparing the speed to the
criteria in Table A-IV. LOS criteria vary for the different classifications of urban street, reflecting
differences in driver expectations.

Interrupted Flow
One of the more important elements limiting, and often interrupting the flow of traffic on a highway is
the intersection. Flow on an interrupted facility is usually dominated by points of fixed operation such
as traffic signals, stop and yield signs. These all operate quite differently and have differing impacts on
overall flow.

Signalized Intersections
The capacity of a highway is related primarily to the geometric characteristics of the facility, as well as to
the composition of the traffic stream on the facility. Geometrics are a fixed, or non-varying,
characteristic of a facility.

At the signalized intersection, an additional element is introduced into the concept of capacity: time
allocation. A traffic signal essentially allocates time among conflicting traffic movements seeking use of
the same physical space. The way in which time is allocated has a significant impact on the operation of
the intersection and on the capacity of the intersection and its approaches.

LOS for signalized intersections is defined in terms of control delay, which is a measure of driver
discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and increased travel time. The delay experienced by a
motorist is made up of a number of factors that relate to control, traffic and incidents. Total delay is the
difference between the travel time actually experienced and the reference travel time that would result
during base conditions, i. e., in the absence of traffic control, geometric delay, any incidents, and any
other vehicles. Specifically, LOS criteria for traffic signals are stated in terms of average control delay
per vehicle, typically for a 15-minute analysis period. Delay is a complex measure and depends on a
number of variables, including the quality of progression, the cycle length, the ratio of green time to
cycle length and the volume to capacity ratio for the lane group.
For each intersection analyzed the average control delay per vehicle per approach is determined for the
peak hour. A weighted average of control delay per vehicle is then determined for the intersection. A
LOS designation is given to the control delay to better describe the level of operation. A description of
levels of service for signalized intersections can be found in Table A-V

Table A-V: Description of Level of Service for Signalized Intersections
LOS                                                    Description

       Very low control delay, up to 10 seconds per vehicle. Progression is extremely favorable, and most
  A    vehicles arrive during the green phase. Many vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may tend to
       contribute to low delay values.


       Control delay greater than 10 and up to 20 seconds per vehicle. There is good progression or short cycle
  B
       lengths or both. More vehicles stop causing higher levels of delay.

       Control delay greater than 20 and up to 35 seconds per vehicle. Higher delays are caused by fair
       progression or longer cycle lengths or both. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear. Cycle failure
  C
       occurs when a given green phase doe not serve queued vehicles, and overflow occurs. The number of
       vehicles stopping is significant, though many still pass through the intersection without stopping.
       Control delay greater than 35 and up to 55 seconds per vehicle. The influence of congestions becomes
       more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle
  D
       lengths, or high volumes. Many vehicles stop, the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual
       cycle failures are noticeable.

       Control delay greater than 55 and up to 80 seconds per vehicle. The limit of acceptable delay. High
  E    delays usually indicate poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high volumes. Individual cycle failures are
       frequent.

       Control delay in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. Unacceptable to most drivers. Oversaturation, arrival
  F    flow rates exceed the capacity of the intersection. Many individual cycle failures. Poor progression and
       long cycle lengths may also be contributing factors to higher delay.

The use of control delay, which may also be referred to as signal delay, was introduced in the 1997
update to the Highway Capacity Manual, and represents a departure from previous updates. In the third
edition, published in 1985 and the 1994 update to the third edition, delay only included stopped delay.
Thus, the LOS criteria listed in Table A-V differs from earlier criteria.

Unsignalized Intersections
The current procedures on unsignalized intersections were first introduced in the 1997 update to the
Highway Capacity Manual and represent a revision of the methodology published in the 1994 update to
the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual. The revised procedures use control delay as a measure of
effectiveness to determine LOS. Delay is a measure of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption,
and increased travel time. The delay experienced by a motorist is made up of a number of factors that
relate to control, traffic and incidents. Total delay is the difference between the travel time actually
experienced and the reference travel time that would result during base conditions, i. e., in the absence
of traffic control, geometric delay, any incidents, and any other vehicles. Control delay is the increased
time of travel for a vehicle approaching and passing through an unsignalized intersection, compared with
a free-flow vehicle if it were not required to slow or stop at the intersection.
Two-Way Stop Controlled Intersections
Two-way stop controlled intersections in which stop signs are used to assign the right-of-way, are the
most prevalent type of intersection in the United States. At two-way stop-controlled intersections the
stop-controlled approaches are referred as the minor street approaches and can be either public streets
or private driveways. The approaches that are not controlled by stop signs are referred to as the major
street approaches.

The capacity of movements subject to delay are determined using the "critical gap" method of capacity
analysis. Expected average control delay based on movement volume and movement capacity is
calculated. A LOS designation is given to the expected control delay for each minor movement. LOS is
not defined for the intersection as a whole. Control delay is the increased time of travel for a vehicle
approaching and passing through a stop-controlled intersection, compared with a free-flow vehicle if it
were not required to slow or stop at the intersection. A description of levels of service for two-way
stop-controlled intersections is found in Table A-VI.

 LOS                                                        Description

  A    Very low control delay less than 10 seconds per vehicle for each movement subject to delay.

  B    Low control delay greater than 10 and up to 15 seconds per vehicle for each movement subject to delay.

  C    Acceptable control delay greater than 15 and up to 25 seconds per vehicle for each movement subject to delay.

  D    Tolerable control delay greater than 25 and up to 35 seconds per vehicle for each movement subject to delay.

  E    Limit of tolerable control delay greater than 35 and up to 50 seconds per vehicle for each movement subject to delay.

  F    Unacceptable control delay in excess of 50 seconds per vehicle for each movement subject to delay.

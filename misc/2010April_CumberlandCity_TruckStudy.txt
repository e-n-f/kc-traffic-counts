Executive Summary
The Cumberland Traffic Circulation and Signing Study summarizes a review of existing truck,
vehicular, and pedestrian traffic in the City of Cumberland in Allegany County, Maryland. The
study examines particular areas in the City where operational, safety, and signing deficiencies
were identified, and provides improvement strategies to address these deficiencies. To
accomplish the primary study goals, truck-related movements, concerns, constraints, and
opportunities were analyzed from a system-wide perspective.


Background Data and Analysis
Project data includes a compilation and analysis of current truck and passenger vehicle traffic
volume and accident data available from the City and State Highway Administration. An
inventory and assessment of existing signage and street and intersection design and geometrics
(including vehicle weight constraints) for all collector and arterial streets was conducted to
identify signage and structural deficiencies. Vehicular and pedestrian traffic counts were
conducted at specific areas of concern.


Issues of Concern
In response to the issues and concerns that were identified, potential improvement options were
developed and refined based on stakeholder discussions and a review of the specific conditions
within the City of Cumberland. Improvement options were investigated as follows:

    ·    Signing and Marking Improvements
    ·    Signalization Improvements
    ·    Geometric Improvements


Project Action Plan
Improvement options were developed based on a variety of analysis tools. The most effective
and feasible options were selected and summarized in the Project Action Plan below.

                                              Consult with local business owners about restricting westbound
             Baltimore Street at Canal        left turns and requiring drivers to access Canal Street from the
  D.2
                        Street                south, which would require installation of signs showing the left
                                              turn restriction.
                                              As a short term solution, install skipped double yellow striping at

                      Baltimore               approaches and install a STOP sign along the Greene Street
             Street/Washington Street         approach with a sign stating "EXCEPT RIGHT TURN".

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Project Description and Purpose
The last Traffic Safety Study for the City of Cumberland was completed in October 1979 by Henningson, Durham, and Richardson.
The report evaluated traffic flows, accident patterns, and traffic controls to determine how traffic patterns should be managed and
directed. Recommended implementation strategies included a long list of signage and traffic control device improvements, street
surface and intersection design improvements, and a number of non-engineering recommendations. Many of the study's
recommendations were implemented, but several--including a truck routing system--were not addressed. Two efforts to improve
directional signage for vehicular traffic were undertaken. The first was in the 1980's to provide directional signage to tourism
destinations (brown signs with a train logo) and the second was a thematic signage program in downtown Cumberland to improve
traffic circulation as recommended by the City's 1998 Downtown Design and Development Plan.
Since the 1979 study and the implementation of the signage programs, Cumberland has changed significantly. Traffic volumes and
travel patterns have changed in response to business closures and redevelopment projects. Consequently, the City sought funding
assistance for a new Traffic Circulation and Signage Study to help address these issues and provide additional guidance and
scheduling justification for street improvements by the City's Pavement Management System. At the City's request, the Allegany
County Department of Planning Services funded this engineering study with the following objectives in mind:
·   To address complaints regarding heavy truck traffic in the downtown area and trucks getting lost on city streets not designed to
    handle heavy loads
·   To address the need for better directional signage to help regional and non-local traffic negotiate the City's street network. The
    City also desires a more unified signage scheme, preferably patterned in accordance with the 1998 Downtown Design and
    Development Plan.
To further the objectives of this study, the City assembled a group of local stakeholders comprised of the City Engineer and City
Planner, representatives of City/State Police, City Fire Department, Tourism Director, and several community and business
representatives with the intent of tapping into this base of local knowledge to gain a broader understanding of traffic operations and
safety issues in the City. The list of stakeholders who participated is contained in Appendix A.
The City contracted with Whitman, Requardt and Associates, LLP (WR&A) to perform the study. WR&A had worked with the City
in the past on related projects, such as Ridgely, WV Truck Restriction Signing Project. WR&A has also worked on many projects
with the Traffic staff of the Maryland State Highway Administration's District 6 office, the staff within SHA responsible for traffic
engineering in Allegany County.

B. Location And Study Area
The study area includes the entire City of Cumberland. The streets/intersections that were studied based on guidance from the
Project Manager and the steering committee are shown in Figure 1.
II. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
A. Background Data
WR&A staff obtained the following data:
·   Topographic mapping of the entire City
·   Documentation of current tourist destination signing and thematic signing
·   Information on high crash locations for SHA maintained roadways in the City, both for road segments and intersections (from
    SHA's Traffic Safety Analysis Division and City records)
·   Road segment traffic volumes from City records
·   Sight distance study at one intersection of concern to the stakeholder committee (MD 51 at Lamont Street)
·   License plate study of trucks traveling through downtown along Mechanic Street (conducted on March 23, 2010).
B. Intersection Counts
Traffic/pedestrian counts were performed at the following seven intersections:
·   Mechanic Street at Queen City Drive
·   Baltimore Street at Mechanic Street
·   Baltimore Street at Canal Street
·   Baltimore Street/Washington Street at Cumberland Street/Greene Street
·   MD 51 at Queen City Drive/Mechanic Street/Centre Street/Winston Street/I-68 Ramps
·   MD 51 at Lamont Street
·   MD 51 at Virginia Avenue
At six of these intersections, counts were performed during the AM peak period of 7:00 to 9:00 AM, and during the PM peak period
of 3:00 to 5:00 PM. A thirteen-hour count was performed at the intersection of Mechanic Street at Queen City Drive between the
hours of 6:00 AM and 7:00 PM for the purpose of a signal warrant study. Traffic count data can be found in Appendix B.

 C. Field Inventory and Traffic Observations
 Field inventory and traffic observations of the major streets and intersection problem areas identified in the Stakeholder meeting
 were conducted during the one-week period of October 19 ­ 22, 2009. Specific data obtained included:
 ·   Inventory of current guide signing
 ·   Geometric features and constraints along the major routes
 ·   Traffic operations and potential trouble spots
 ·   Truck turning movements and opportunities for alternative routing, (included travel time/delay run on several routes)
 ·   Pedestrian/bicyclist patterns

     (WR&A's assigned traffic engineer was accompanied by Mr. Einer Johnson, a member of the stakeholder committee, to seven of
     the City's signalized intersections to view control equipment)
III. ISSUES OF CONCERN
     Issues of concern were identified based on direct field observations as well as discussions and comments from stakeholder
     meeting. Figure 2 shows a map of the City of Cumberland with the locations of these issues. These issues are described in Table 1
     with brief descriptions of the potential concerns. In addition to the ten issues shown in Figure 2, there are three citywide issues.

The following is a detailed description of each issue, along with an assessment of potential solutions. Issues A, B, and C involve
assessments of current conditions. Issues 1 and 10 involve signing and marking improvements only. Issue 5 consists of a solution
that involves signing only, and alternative solutions that involve signalization and/or geometric improvements. All other issues
involve operational improvements.
A. Traffic Signal Condition
WR&A's assigned traffic engineer was accompanied by Mr. Einer Johnson, a city resident who is a member of the stakeholder
committee, to six of the City's signalized intersections to view control equipment. Mr. Johnson volunteers his services and helps the
City to troubleshoot signal timing, phasing and electrical problems. He formerly worked for the City of Baltimore's traffic signal
electronics shop as a maintenance technician. He has also been able to assist the City in procuring used traffic controllers, cabinets
and conflict monitors from Baltimore that became expendable when they modernized their traffic control system. That equipment is
currently in use at three intersections.
Following is an assessment of the signal equipment at the seven intersections visited. Figures 3A, 3B, and 3C show examples of the
equipment.
·   Queen City Drive at Centre Street (Figure 3A)
    o The control cabinet is not sealed and, to prevent water intrusion, it has been covered with a garbage bag.
    o Loop detection is not working along southbound Queen City Drive and that movement has been placed on recall
       (i.e. signal changes to serve QCD whether or not vehicle is present).
    o The northbound loops are working with no problems.
·   Centre Street at Valley Street
    o The northbound Valley Street thru lane needs a new loop.
    o The signal is operating on recall for the Valley Street approaches, and provides a 20-second phase length.
·   Mechanic Street at Valley Street ­ the pedestrian signals have been removed.
·   Mechanic Street at Henderson Avenue ­ the westbound Mechanic Street loop has been removed.
·   Henderson Avenue at Pear Street (Figure 3B) ­ the northbound Pear Street signal heads are covered to prevent
    vandalism.
·   Henderson Avenue at Knox Street (Figure 3C)
    o The controller has telephone communication, but the communication has not worked in over three years.
    o The signal provides 34 seconds to Knox Street every time a vehicle is detected, which causes excessive delay along
       Henderson Avenue.

Additional problems with traffic signal equipment were raised at the steering committee meeting and in discussions with
Mr. Johnson:
·   The intersections in downtown, many of which are closely spaced, are not interconnected, and therefore operate as a
    series of isolated intersections, which leads to inefficient operations and unnecessary delays.
·   Four different brands of controllers and a mix of control cabinet brands/generations are used at the twenty two
    signalized intersections in the City. When a signal goes out of service due to a knockdown, part failure or for some
    other reason, it can remain out of service for an extended period of time, depending on the availability of a compatible

                                                                                                          Traffic Circulation and Signing Study


    controller. This was the case recently at the intersection of Queen City Drive at Baltimore Street, which has a railroad
    pre-emption circuit. Mr. Johnson was able to fashion a temporary fix to get the signal operating in flashing mode, but
    it wasn't until the controller manufacturer could send out a representative from Florida that the permanent repair
    could be installed.
The deteriorating condition of the signal equipment is the most serious of the traffic-related problems that was observed
during the study. The City should consider a staged modernization of all signal equipment, starting with the equipment
in Downtown, which has the heaviest concentration of traffic and pedestrians, most complex intersections and inter-
related signal operations, and the greatest need for a well-functioning, modern signal system. A more detailed study of
the signalized intersections is needed to identify the cost of such a modernization program; however, as a rough estimate,
the City of Winchester, Virginia is very near completion of a traffic signal modernization program that was implemented
at a cost of approximately $150,000 per intersection for equipment modernization (complete rebuilds) and an additional
$5,000 per intersection for retiming (4 timing plans per intersection).
B. Directional Signing Adequacy
As has been noted through various discussions with City staff and the stakeholder group there is a perception that Cumberland's
street system is confusing, making navigation difficult for unfamiliar drivers. Some of this confusion could be a result of the
discontinuity in the street system. Barriers, both natural (Potomac River and Willis Creek) and man-made (I-68 Viaduct, Railroad,
Baltimore Street Pedestrian Mall) have resulted in street rerouting and closures. In addition, certain streets are one-way for portions
only, further complicating drivers' understanding of the street network. Although outside the scope of this study, a comprehensive
review of the street network, including review of one-way patterns could provide options for simplifying Cumberland's street
network.
Although Cumberland's street system can be confusing, there are several guide signing systems in place to guide unfamiliar drivers
to select sites through the City. These existing guide signs were inventoried by WR&A (see Appendix F). Most are in good to poor
condition. The majority of the signs provide messages that are adequate and relevant to motorists. Most of the signing issues noted
below are more global in nature and do not specifically relate to a particular sign or routing issue.
·   Street Name Sign Letter Type and Size. The current edition of the MUTCD (2009) requires that all street name signs be
    composed of an initial upper case letter followed by lower case letters. Typically the street name signs within the City contain all
    uppercase letters. In addition, the MUTCD requires that overhead street name signs contain a 12" initial upper case letter
    followed by a 9" lower case letters. The larger text size will increase the size of the sign substantially. This combination of mixed
    case text and larger text has been found to provide better recognition by motorists. The deadline for updating signs to conform


                                                                                                                                Page 9 of 65

    with the 2009 MUTCD is January 9, 2012 for 6" initial upper case letter followed by lower case letters on post mounted signs; and
    December 22, 2018 for overhead street name signs containing a 12" initial upper case letter followed by a 9" lower case letters.
·   Message Inconsistency. Most guide signs in downtown are of a decorative type with curved tops and consist of three types ­
    Destination, Parking, and Marquee signs. In addition, there are brown "Historic Cumberland" signs that contain similar
    messages. All of these signs are intended to guide tourists and unfamiliar drivers once they are on the city streets, and most of
    these drivers use I-68 to reach Cumberland. Ideally, to avoid motorist confusion, the messages displayed on I-68 would be
    consistent with the City's directional sign messages. In at least two cases, this is not so, and in many cases, destinations that are
    signed on the City's signs are not mentioned on the highway. These cases are described in Table 2.

    It is neither expected nor practical to sign all tourist destinations in the City on I-68. SHA has developed the Tourism Area and
    Corridor Signing Program to address such situations. The program consultants typically begin the process by conducting a
    geographical analysis of attractions and then develop a preliminary breakdown of the region into tourism areas and corridors.
    Tourists are first guided to areas, then corridors, then individual attractions. The City should work with Allegany County to
    coordinate with SHA to consider Cumberland for the TAC Program.
·   Sign Layout. The majority of the City's directional signs are sized to fit within the constraints of an urban environment; however,
    the size of the text used is smaller than minimum allowed (6" upper case/4" lower case) and/or the spacing has been compressed

    to make messages fit. In addition, some signs contain route marker shields to guide motorists, which are very helpful to guide
    the motorist; however, the size of these shields is approximately 9", almost a third of the minimum shield size of 24". The small
    size of these legend elements may not allow all drivers to read and react to these signs, rendering them useless. Another
    consideration is the color of the signs, which should meet Federal contrast requirements. Use of standard guide sign colors (white
    on green/blue/brown) will ensure signs meet these requirements. Also, the signs are typically painted, with no retro-reflective
    qualities. Using retro-reflective sheeting would enhance the night time visibility of these signs. Figures 4A ­ 4H show examples
    of the different types of signs throughout the City.

C. Truck-Related Issues
During the field inventories and associated studies of City mapping, potential constraints, conflicts, and controlling factors were
indentified that could affect truck travel or the selection of future improvement alternatives throughout the City. Identified issues
include the following:
1. Truck Travel along Mechanic Street through Downtown
a. Problem
Many residents and businesses have complained about truck traffic on Mechanic Street in downtown Cumberland. Of particular
concern to the City are coal trucks that travel from coal mines in southern Pennsylvania to the Warrior Run power plant south of the
city on Mexico Farms Road. Additionally, many large trucks travel through downtown to access I-68 and US 220. A survey of truck
traffic taken on Tuesday, March 23, 2010, showed that out of 111 trucks that traveled southbound through Mechanic Street north of
the city and/or downtown at Harrison Street, only 21 passed through both points, one of which turned right onto Howard Street. The
vast majority of trucks that travel along Mechanic Street have destinations within the City. Of the 20 vehicles that can be classified as
through traffic, 14 continued southbound along MD 51, and 6 took the on-ramp to Eastbound I-68. No coal trucks were observed on
the day the truck study was conducted.
The route that trucks take along Mechanic Street from north of the city to the power plant is displayed in Figure 5, along with details
of this route. Details of travel time runs can be found in Appendix D. The 7.8-mile route takes approximately 15 minutes. After
passing through the city, trucks continue southbound along MD 51 to reach the power plant.

b. Potential Solutions
There are three alternate routes that through trucks could follow that would reduce truck traffic through downtown Cumberland
while maintaining a reasonable travel time and travel distance for these trucks. Signing improvements would help to divert truck
travel along Mechanic Street by directing trucks to alternate routes. The three detour routes begin just north of the MD 36 at US 40
Alt. intersection north of the city. Travel time runs were conducted along the Mechanic Street route as well as the proposed detour
routes. The proposed detour routes are displayed in Figures 6A, 6B, and 6C, along with their respective travel distances, travel times,
and route details. Details of travel time runs can be found in Appendix D. After passing through the city, all routes continue
southbound along MD 51 to reach the power plant.

As shown, Route B has the shortest average travel time, which is approximately identical to that of the route along Mechanic Street
through downtown. Routes B and C have approximately the same travel distance, which is significantly shorter than that of Route A,
and about 0.3 miles longer than the route along Mechanic Street. While Route C's travel time is only about one minute longer than
that of Route B and the route along Mechanic Street, trucks may have difficulty traveling between the two closely-spaced
intersections of Front Street at Baltimore Street and Baltimore Street at Queen City Drive. Trucks traveling along this route would
travel SB along Henderson Avenue, turn right onto Baltimore Street, and then immediately turn left onto Queen City Drive. This
maneuver may make Route C a less-than-desirable route. Route A would minimize travel time through the City of Cumberland and
would take trucks off of Mechanic Street everywhere south of Henderson Avenue; however, travel time and travel distance along
this route is greater than along either of the other two routes.
                                                                        FIGURE 7 ­ROUTES TO I-68 FROM ROUTE B
c. Recommendation
In order to direct traffic along Route B, install signs
along Mechanic Street north of its intersection with
Queen City Drive restricting trucks along Mechanic
Street beyond Queen City Drive, with an exception of
local deliveries.
In addition to coal trucks traveling to the power
plant, trucks wishing to reach I-68 should also follow
Route B. As shown in Figure 7, when trucks are                                                                             Route B
driving along Queen City Drive, they may turn right                                  To I-68 WB
onto Harrison Street to access I-68 Westbound or turn
right onto Mechanic Street to access I-68 Eastbound.
Alternatively, if trucks have difficulty making the
turn onto Centre Street, they may turn right onto
Mechanic Street, then right onto Harrison Street to
                                                                                       To I-68 EB
turn right onto the ramp to I-68 Eastbound.

a. Problem

This intersection (see Figure 8), which is located in the northern
section of Cumberland, is a stop-controlled intersection. It is
located at the north end of the truck detour proposed under Issue
C.1.

Queen City Drive terminates at Mechanic Street, and there is a
parking lot on the opposite side of the intersection from Queen
City Drive, which serves as the eastbound leg of the intersection.
Mechanic Street is one-way southbound, with a thru lane and a
left-turn lane upstream of the intersection. There is one travel lane
downstream of the intersection, along with a parking lane on the
left side of the roadway. Queen City Drive is a two-lane roadway
with parking along both sides. Stop-sign control is present along
the westbound Queen City Drive approach and the eastbound
parking lot approach.

Approximately 40 feet north of the intersection, there is a bridge
over Mechanic Street with a vertical clearance of 14'-0" in the
center of the roadway, 11'-6" along the left side of the roadway,
and 12'-0" along the right side of the roadway, as shown in Figure
9 below. Several trucks were observed traveling through the
center of the roadway, straddling the southbound thru lane and
the southbound left-turn lane, to clear the bridge. Additionally,
there are concerns about whether eastbound and westbound
vehicles receive enough gaps in southbound traffic to clear the
intersection with minimal delay.

b. Potential Solutions
Installation of a traffic signal at this intersection had been considered to provide eastbound and westbound traffic with a phase
independent from southbound traffic so that vehicles along these approaches would not have to wait for gaps in southbound traffic
to clear the intersection. A thirteen-hour count was performed at this intersection on Wednesday, December 16, 2009 from 6 AM to 7
PM for the purpose of a signal warrant study. Table 3 provides a summary of the signal warrant analysis. Detailed signal warrant
analysis can be found in Appendix E. As shown in Table 3, the warrant is not met. Warrants 1 and 2, which require minimum
vehicular volumes to be met during at least 8 hours and 4 hours respectively, are not met during any hour.

Analysis was performed using SimTraffic simulation software during the AM peak hour of 11:00 AM to Noon and the PM peak hour
of 3:00 to 4:00 PM. Table 4 summarizes the results of SimTraffic analysis. Detailed SimTraffic output is included in Appendix E. As
shown, the intersection currently operates at LOS A during both peak hours. Vehicles along the minor approaches have low average
delay times. During peak hour observations, frequent gaps in southbound traffic were observed, and delay times for vehicles along
the minor approaches were low.

In order to address the issue of southbound truck drivers traveling though the southbound thru lane and the southbound left-turn
lane simultaneously and to improve the turning geometrics for trucks following the diversion route proposed under Issue C.1 (see
discussion under C.4), the southbound left-turn lane can be removed, requiring all southbound traffic to use a single lane, which
would be placed in the center of the roadway where the clearance is the greatest. As shown in Table 5 below, removal of the
southbound left-turn lane would have a minimal impact on operations. Average delay would increase by 0.5 seconds during each
peak hour, and LOS would remain unchanged. Detailed SimTraffic output can be found in Appendix E.

To better accommodate southbound left-turning truck traffic, the westbound lane of Queen City Drive should be relocated to the
right, to provide more room for southbound turns to safely make their turning movement. Parking along this approach would have
to be removed to accommodate the relocation of the travel lane. If parking is in high demand in this area, more parking could be
provided along Mechanic Street north of the intersection if the left-turn lane here is removed, in the areas where there are not
adjacent driveways.

A traffic signal warrant analysis was performed under the proposed geometry. Table 6 provides a summary of this analysis. Detailed
signal warrant analysis can be found in Appendix E. As shown, no warrants are met under this geometry.
c. Recommendation
Signing and marking improvements are recommended at this intersection, which include removal of the southbound left-turn lane of
Mechanic Street as well as the relocation of the westbound lane of Queen City Drive. A signal is not recommended for this location.

d. Trucks on Washington Street
Trucks traveling westbound along Baltimore Street through the intersection of Washington Street/Cumberland Street/Greene Street
that are destined for Ridgely, WV or westbound Interstate 68 will sometimes inadvertently continue westbound along Washington
Street. Washington Street is an inadequate route for trucks for three reasons. First, Washington Street is a residential street. It is
narrow in several areas, which is particularly problematic for trucks and many residents have complained about these stray trucks.
Second, Washington Street becomes one-way eastbound at Kiefer Avenue. At this point, trucks must turn right onto Kiefer Avenue
and then make a hard left onto Fayette Street to reach Braddock Road and Greene Street. Finally, there is a weight-restricted bridge
over the railroad, east of Chase Street (Single Unit 15,000 lbs GVW, Combination Unit 22,000 lbs GCW).
The intended route for trucks traveling westbound along Baltimore Street at the Washington Street/Cumberland Street/Greene Street
is along Greene Street, which can accommodate large trucks and provides the most direct access to points west of the City. Some of
the directional signs around the Baltimore Street/Washington Street/Cumberland Street/Greene Street intersection contain the
message "Washington Street Historic District".
Recommendations: The City should add the regulatory message "NO TRUCKS" below the guide message to help alert trucks to the
existing truck restriction along Washington Street. In addition, the approach to this intersection is one that contains the undersized I-
68 route shield on the historic sign panel, as previously discussed. Using a standard shield would provide much better direction for
trucks destined for the interstate.
e. Inadequate Truck Turning Radii
Locations: Based on field-observations, a review of existing and proposed truck routes, and stakeholder comments, the following
turning movements throughout the City may be difficult for trucks to execute due to existing intersection geometrics such as tight
corner radii, narrow lanes, skewed approach angles, etc.
·   Southbound left turns from Mechanic Street onto Queen City Drive (north side of City)
·   Westbound left turns from Harrison Street onto I-68 Westbound On-ramp at Liberty Street
·   Southbound right turns from Queen City Drive onto Harrison Street
·   Westbound right turns from Queen City Drive onto Centre Street (north side of City)
·   Westbound left turns from Queen City Drive/Winston Street onto southbound MD 51
·   Westbound right turns from Winston Street onto Mechanic Street
·   Westbound left turns from Harrison Street onto Mechanic Street
Analyses: To quantify any problematic maneuvers, AutoTURN software was used to assess locations where tractor-trailer trucks
have difficulty making turning maneuvers. AutoTURN is a CAD-based software tool that specifically evaluates vehicle paths and
clearances through intersections for various vehicle types. For this project, vehicle centerline paths were drawn to scale on aerial
                                                                                                                              Page 25 of 65

the paths of the front and rear overhangs of the truck being evaluated. The analyses are summarized in Table 7. Graphics displaying
the results of AutoTURN analyses can be found in Appendix C.

1. Baltimore Street at Mechanic Street

a. Problem
The intersection of Baltimore Street at Mechanic Street is a T-intersection
with Baltimore Street terminating at Mechanic Street. Northbound
Mechanic Street consists of a shared left-turn/thru lane, southbound
Mechanic Street consists of a thru lane and a right-turn lane, and
eastbound Mechanic Street consists of a left-turn lane and a right-turn
lane. Baltimore Street is a pedestrian plaza east of the intersection. This
intersection has significant pedestrian traffic, including 33 pedestrians
crossing the intersection during the AM peak hour, and 32 pedestrians
crossing during the PM peak hour, as measured during counts conducted
on Wednesday, December 16, 2009. The intersection is controlled by a
traffic signal, with exclusive/permissive left turn phasing along the
northbound Mechanic Street approach, permissive/overlap right-turn
phasing along the southbound Mechanic Street approach, and a push-
button actuated exclusive pedestrian phase. Right turns on red are
permitted along the eastbound Baltimore Street approach. The layout of
this intersection as well as the nearby intersections of Baltimore Street at
Canal Street and Baltimore Street/Washington Street at Cumberland
Street/Greene Street is shown in Figure 10. The intersections of Baltimore
Street at Canal Street and Baltimore Street/Washington Street at
Cumberland Street/Greene Street are analyzed in their respective sections
of this report.
A lunchtime survey of pedestrian activity was conducted from 11:55 AM to 12:15 PM on Tuesday, October 20, 2009, as lunchtime is a
period of heavy pedestrian traffic. During this 20-minute period, a total of 37 pedestrians crossed at the intersection, 6 pedestrians
crossed near the intersection, and 5 walked across the pedestrian plaza along the east side of the intersection. Of the 37 pedestrians
that crossed at the intersection, 20 did so during the exclusive pedestrian phase. 17 pedestrians did not wait for the pedestrian phase
and instead crossed when they saw an adequate gap in vehicular traffic.

                                                                                                                   Traffic Circulation and Signing Study

This intersection experiences significant queuing along northbound Baltimore Street due to heavy left-turning traffic along this
approach, including 137 turns during the AM peak hour and 222 turns during the PM peak hour. Vehicles that do not clear during
the exclusive left-turn phase receive few gaps in southbound traffic during the permissive phase, and typically have to wait until the
end of the permissive phase to clear the intersection. As a result, several vehicles must wait through the red phase and then clear the
intersection during the following left-turn phase. As the northbound approach is a single-lane approach with a narrow shoulder,
northbound thru vehicles are unable to bypass left-turning vehicles. As there are buildings along both sides of the roadway,
widening the roadway would be a less-than-desirable option.

Eastbound Mechanic Street left-turn queues are significant during the                            FIGURE 11 ­ HEAVY WESTBOUND QUEUES
PM peak hour, and frequently extend beyond the railroad tracks west                                   DURING THE PM PEAK HOUR
of Canal Street, as shown in Figure 11. During a survey of queuing at
this intersection from 4:00 to 5:00 PM on Wednesday, October 21,
2009, there were 14 instances in which queues developed in the left
lane that extended beyond the railroad tracks. During this period,
there were 8 instances of cars stopped on the railroad tracks, creating
a potential safety issue. 4 of the 14 queues extended to the
intersection of Baltimore Street/Washington Street at Cumberland
Street/Greene Street, blocking traffic at this intersection.
Additionally, there was one queue of right-turning vehicles that
extended beyond the railroad tracks, which included a vehicle that
stopped on the tracks. No trains traveled across Baltimore Street
during this observation period.

Table 8 provides a summary of existing peak hour conditions at the
Baltimore Street at Mechanic Street intersection. Detailed SimTraffic output can be found in Appendix E. This intersection, the
Baltimore Street at Canal Street intersection, and the Baltimore Street/Washington Street at Cumberland Street/Greene Street
intersection are all closely spaced. The operations of these three intersections are related to each other due to their proximity, and
were therefore analyzed as a single network in SimTraffic. Analyses of the other two intersections in this network can be found in
their respective sections of this report.

b. Potential Solution
The intersection was analyzed with the proposed condition of removal of the pedestrian phase. Under this scenario, pedestrians
would cross the intersection during the same phases as vehicular traffic. The overlap phase for southbound Mechanic Street right
turns would be removed to allow pedestrians to cross Mechanic Street during the Baltimore Street phase. A summary of proposed
conditions at this intersection can be found in Table 9, and detailed SimTraffic output can be found in Appendix E.

c. Recommendation
Remove the pedestrian phase and allow pedestrians to cross the roadway during vehicular phases. Investigate coordination of this
signal with the nearby signals at the intersections of Mechanic Street at Bedford Street and Mechanic Street at Harrison Street.
2. Baltimore Street at Canal Street

a. Problem
The intersection of Baltimore Street at Canal Street is located approximately 150 feet west of the intersection of Baltimore Street at
Mechanic Street, and approximately 250 feet east of the intersection of Baltimore Street/Washington Street at Cumberland
Street/Greene Street. Stop control is present along the Canal Street approaches. Additionally, there is a pedestrian-actuated flashing
signal for the Great Allegheny Passage Trail at this intersection that directs vehicles to stop as pedestrians cross Baltimore Street.
Drivers obey this signal and stop for crossing pedestrians when the signal is flashing. All approaches consist of a single lane;
however, eastbound Baltimore Street consists of two lanes just east of this intersection, and the eastbound approach, while striped
for one lane, is wide enough to accommodate two lanes of vehicles. These two lanes serve as the left-turn lane and right-turn lane at
the Baltimore Street at Mechanic Street intersection. This intersection is adjacent to railroad tracks. Vehicles typically slow down
approaching these tracks due to the steep grade along both sides of these railroad tracks. The layout of this intersection is shown in
Figure 10 above.
During AM peak hour observations on Wednesday, October 21, 2009, delay for all vehicles was minimal due to low traffic volumes.
Turning volumes are particularly low. During the traffic count performed on Thursday, December 17, 2009, only one vehicle arrived
at the intersection along the parking lot north of the intersection, and six vehicles arrived at the intersection along NB Canal Street.
Traffic is heavier during the PM peak hour. During the traffic count performed on Thursday, December 17, 2009, 19 vehicles arrived
at the intersection along southbound Canal Street, and 12 vehicles arrived at the intersection along northbound Canal Street. The
intersection is frequently blocked due to queuing along the Baltimore Street approach at the intersection of Baltimore Street at
Mechanic Street.
While turning volumes are low (13 AM/1 PM westbound lefts and 12 AM/2 PM eastbound lefts), these vehicles sometimes have to
wait a while for adequate gaps to turn, blocking traffic. Westbound left turns are of particular concern, as the queues that develop
behind the turning vehicles can extend beyond the intersection of Baltimore Street at Mechanic Street, blocking vehicles along
Mechanic Street from turning onto Baltimore Street.
Table 10 provides a summary of existing peak hour conditions at the Baltimore Street at Canal Street intersection. Detailed SimTraffic
output can be found in Appendix E.

b. Potential Solutions
With the proposed revisions to signal timing at the nearby intersection of Baltimore Street at Mechanic Street, the queues along
Baltimore Street will not extend to the Baltimore Street at Canal Street intersection. A summary of operations at the Baltimore Street
at Canal Street intersection can be found in Table 11, and detailed SimTraffic output can be found in Appendix E.

Restricting westbound left turns would eliminate the instances of westbound queues extending to the intersection of Baltimore Street
at Mechanic Street; however, this would block vehicles from the east from using the only publicly-owned entrance to Canal Street.
Vehicles could enter Canal Street from the south, but would have to travel through a private parking lot, via Harrison Street, to do
so.
c. Recommendation
The signal timing improvements at the nearby intersection of Baltimore Street at Mechanic Street will result in improvements at this
intersection. Consult with local business owners about possibly restricting westbound left turns and requiring drivers to access Canal
Street from the south, which would require installation of signs showing the left turn restriction.

3. Baltimore Street/Washington Street at Cumberland Street/Greene Street

a. Problem
The intersection of Baltimore Street/Washington Street at Cumberland Street/Greene Street is a stop-controlled intersection with stop
control along the eastbound Washington Street and southbound Cumberland Street approaches. This is in conflict with the Manual
on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which states, "STOP signs and YIELD signs shall not be installed on different
approaches to the same unsignalized intersection if those approaches conflict with or oppose each other." The westbound Baltimore
Street and northbound Greene Street approaches are free movements. The heaviest movements are northbound right turns (310
AM/407 PM) and westbound left turns (164 AM/317 PM). All other vehicular movements experience peak hour volumes of 61
vehicles per hour or less. Three of the four approaches are single-lane approaches, with the exception of the northbound Greene
Street approach, which has a separate right-turn lane. The layout of this intersection is shown in Figure 10 above. Trucks sometimes
travel westbound along Baltimore Street through the intersection of Baltimore Street/Washington Street at Cumberland
Street/Greene Street and continue westbound along Washington Street (in violation of a signed truck restriction), when the preferred
route is to turn left onto Greene Street. Table 12 provides a summary of existing peak hour conditions at the Baltimore
Street/Washington Street at Cumberland Street/Greene Street intersection. Detailed SimTraffic output is located in Appendix E.

b. Potential Solutions
To prevent trucks from traveling west through this intersection from Baltimore Street to Washington Street, the intersection should
be altered to make it clear that the primary westbound movement is to turn onto Greene Street. Currently, there are no markings at
the intersection that indicate that this movement is the major movement. Installing skipped double yellow striping at the intersection
between the Baltimore Street and Greene Street approaches would direct travelers in this direction and reduce confusion at this
intersection. In addition, the Greene Street approach would have a STOP sign with an accompanying sign stating "EXCEPT RIGHT
TURN" to prevent confusion over right-of-way between Greene Street traffic and Baltimore Street traffic.
It should be noted that no trucks made the westbound thru movement from Baltimore Street to Washington Street during the traffic
count conducted on Thursday, December 17, 2009 from 7:00 ­ 9:00 AM and 4:00 ­ 6:00 PM. Trucks accounted for 0.4% of all
westbound left turns onto Greene Street. While this may indicate that trucks already follow the recommended route through Greene
Street during the peak hours, there may be trucks that take the route through Washington Street during off-peak hours.
In addition to the proposed signing and marking improvements, four solutions were analyzed:
A. All-way stop control
B. Two-way stop control along Cumberland Street and Greene Street
C. Roundabout
D. Traffic signal

The first two options are low-cost improvements that would bring the intersection to meet MUTCD standards and may improve
expectancy for drivers unfamiliar with the intersection. Option C, a roundabout, would be a one-lane roundabout with single-lane
approaches. Option D, a traffic signal, is unlikely to meet the signal warrants but serves as an example of how signalization would
alter intersection operations. The proposed signal would be semi-actuated with permissive phasing along the Baltimore Street and
Washington Street approaches and split phasing along the Cumberland Street and Greene Street approaches. Options A, B, and D
were analyzed using SimTraffic software, and Option C was analyzed using SIDRA roundabout analysis software. Tables 13A
through 12D show the peak hour conditions under the proposed solutions. Detailed SimTraffic and SIDRA output is located in
Appendix E.

c. Recommendation
As a short term solution, install skipped double yellow striping at the intersection between the Baltimore Street and Greene Street
approaches and install a STOP sign along the Greene Street approach with a sign stating "EXCEPT RIGHT TURN" to prevent
confusion over right-of-way between Greene Street traffic and Baltimore Street traffic. Additional discussion is required for how to
sign the northbound left turn. There is no standard sign in the MUTCD to cover this movement, which requires northbound left
turning drivers to yield to westbound left turning drivers. As a long term solution, examine the feasibility of a roundabout.

a. Problem
This network of intersections consists of two signalized intersections and
one stop-controlled intersection, all in close proximity to each other. A
diagram of this intersection is shown in Figure 12. This network consists of
the three inter-related intersections, listed from west to east:
·   I-68 Eastbound Off-Ramp at Winston Street ­ stop control along I-68
    Eastbound Off-Ramp
·   Mechanic Street/MD 51 at Winston Street ­ signalized
·   Centre Street/MD 51 at Winston Street/Queen City Drive ­ signalized
There are three lanes of northbound MD 51, which split into five lanes
approximately 350' south of the intersection. Two lanes continue north
onto Mechanic Street (with an option to turn left onto Winston Street from
the left-most of these lanes), one lane continues north onto Centre Street
(with an option to turn left onto Winston Street), and two lanes continue
north onto eastbound Queen City Drive via channelized right-turn lanes.
This right-turn movement is a free movement. The lane of NB MD 51 that
continues onto Centre Street leads to an on-ramp onto I-68 Westbound just
north of the intersection. The right lane of Mechanic Street leads to an on-
ramp I-68 Eastbound just north of the intersection.

Southbound Mechanic Street consists of two lanes north of Winston Street.
At its intersection with Winston Street, Mechanic Street consists of a thru
lane and a shared thru/right-turn lane. The thru lanes continue onto
southbound MD 51. The I-68 Eastbound Off-Ramp consists of a single-lane southbound approach at Winston Street with a
channelized right-turn lane. The thru lane is stop-controlled and continues onto southbound MD 51. The right-turn lane is yield-
controlled. Westbound Queen City Drive consists of two lanes. There is a free right-turn movement onto Centre Street, which serves
as an added lane on Centre Street. West of Centre Street, Queen City Drive becomes Winston Street, which consists of a left-turn lane
onto southbound MD 51 and a thru lane.

The intersection network operates on two-phase signal operations consisting of a northbound/ southbound phase and a westbound
phase. There are no eastbound approaches at this intersection, as the eastbound lanes of Queen City Drive are formed from the
channelized right-turn lanes of northbound MD 51. Both signalized intersections operate under the same controller.

Between January 2006 and December 2008, there were 21                                            TABLE 14 ­ CRASH DATA SUMMARY

City Drive right turns, which is currently an unrestricted
movement. Vehicles making this right-turn movement that wish to enter the left lane of Centre Street must wait for gaps in traffic in
the left lane to clear before changing lanes. There is a Wendy's restaurant along the west side of Centre Street that is accessible from
Centre Street as well as from Winston Street. The Winston Street entrance is between the two signals. Although patrons traveling
westbound along Queen City Drive/Winston Street can access the restaurant by traveling through the first signalized intersection
and making an immediate right turn into the parking lot, several drivers choose instead to bypass the signal by turning right onto
Centre Street, waiting for traffic to clear in the left lane of Centre Street, then crossing into the left lane of Centre Street to turn left
into the Wendy's parking lot. A similar issue arises when vehicles make a right turn from westbound Queen City Drive onto Centre
Street to access the I-68 Westbound On-Ramp, although in this case the drivers have a greater distance where they can change lanes.

Existing peak hour conditions were analyzed using SimTraffic software. A summary of peak hour conditions can be found in Table
15. Detailed SimTraffic output is located in Appendix E. As shown, the overall network operates at LOS A during the AM peak hour
and LOS B during the PM peak hour.

b. Proposed Solutions
Signal timing adjustments can reduce the long northbound queue lengths. The minimum times for westbound vehicles approaching
Centre Street can be decreased to allow more time for northbound vehicles. In the PM peak hour, the cycle length can be reduced
from 80 seconds to 60 seconds. Table 16 shows the effects of the optimized timings (see Appendix E for SimTraffic analysis). As
shown, overall delay decreases during both peak hours. 95th percentile queue lengths along the lane of northbound MD 51 that leads
to Centre Street decrease from 215 feet to 141 feet during the AM peak hour and from 320 feet to 246 feet during the PM peak hour.

During the peak hour observation periods, the I-68 Eastbound Off-Ramp experienced maximum queues of 6 vehicles during the AM
peak hour and 8 vehicles during the PM peak hour. Additionally, there may be confusion and a potential safety issue here as these
vehicles must stop for northbound lefts and southbound rights at the Mechanic Street/MD 51 at Winston Street intersection. The
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), Section 2B.05, states, "Because the potential for conflicting commands could
create driver confusion, STOP signs shall not be installed at intersections where traffic control signals are installed and operating."
Installation of a signal at this intersection in place of the existing stop sign would address this issue. The signal would be coordinated
with the existing signals at this intersection. By installing a signal here, vehicles would be able to travel through the intersection
without stopping during the green phase, and there would be less confusion over right-of-way. The southbound right-turn
movement along Mechanic Street, which currently serves 2 vehicles during the AM peak hour and 5 vehicles during the PM peak
hour, would be restricted. These drivers could instead access Winston Street by turning left onto Harrison Street north of the
intersection, and then turn right onto Queen City Drive and continue through the intersection to Winston Street. This scenario was
modeled in SimTraffic, and results are shown in Table 17 below. Detailed SimTraffic output can be found in Appendix E. Overall
network delay decreases slightly. Average delay along the I-68 Eastbound Off-Ramp decreases, although 95th percentile queue
lengths along this approach increase. These queue lengths (138 feet during the AM peak hour and 180 feet during the PM peak hour)
are much shorter than the length of the ramp (approximately 500 feet).
If it is desired to continue to allow vehicles from the I-68 Eastbound Off-Ramp to clear the intersection during the red phase, a
green/flashing red signal could be installed for this approach. The signal here would be green when northbound MD 51 and
southbound Mechanic Street have the green phase, and would be flashing red when westbound Winston Street and westbound
Queen City Drive have the green phase. Such a signal would allow vehicles along this approach to travel through the intersection
without stopping during the green phase, and would also allow vehicles to cross the intersection on the red phase after stopping to
look for conflicting traffic.

free movement was also examined. Under this scenario, westbound
thru vehicles wishing to access Winston Street west of the intersection
would be required to turn left onto southbound MD 51 and then make
an immediate right, accessing Winston Street via the access point to the
south of this intersection. These vehicles would have to enter an
approximately 350 foot long weave section with traffic from the I-68
Eastbound Off-Ramp. As this ramp experiences a PM peak hour
volume of 537 vehicles, which would allow for few gaps, this is an
unadvisable scenario.
While signal retiming helps reduce the queue lengths in the
northbound lanes, further geometric improvements would improve
intersection operations. Two alternatives were developed in which the
northbound MD 51 lane configuration is altered. Under Alternative 1,
shown in Figure 13, the left-most lane leads to Mechanic Street, the
center lane leads to both Mechanic Street and Centre Street, and the
right-most lane leads to both Centre Street and Queen City Drive. This
would separate the traffic heading to Mechanic Street and Eastbound I-
68 from traffic heading to Centre Street and Westbound I-68.
Additionally, both lanes of Centre Street north of Queen City Drive
would serve traffic from northbound MD 51, and right-turning
vehicles from westbound Queen City Drive would be required to stop
before turning onto Centre Street, thus allowing these vehicles to
immediately enter their desired lane upon turning.
This scenario was modeled in SimTraffic. Results can be found in Table
18, and detailed SimTraffic output can be found in Appendix E. As shown, results do not differ significantly from those detailed in
Table 17. During the PM peak hour, the northbound MD 51 95th percentile queue length at the Centre Street/MD 51 at Winston
Street/Queen City Drive intersection decreases from 320 feet under existing conditions to 249 feet. This queue develops in the right
lane as opposed to the left lane. This layout would make it easier for vehicles to safely enter northbound MD 51 from Canal Parkway,
which is addressed in the next section of the report.

A second alternative involves changing the northbound lane configurations so that the left lane leads to Mechanic Street and I-68
Eastbound, the center lane would lead to Centre Street and I-68 Westbound, and the right lane would lead to Queen City Drive, as
shown in Figure 14. This scenario was modeled in SimTraffic. Results can be found in Table 19 and detailed SimTraffic output can be
found in Appendix E. As shown, this configuration provides slightly improved operations compared to the first alternative
configuration.

c. Recommendation
As a short term solution, implement the proposed signal timing revisions. As a long term solution, implement Alternative 2, which
includes changes to the northbound lane configurations, as well as signalization of the Eastbound I-68 off-ramp. Install new
overhead signs to direct traffic into the correct lane. Similar lane configuration alternatives have been explored by SHA. These
improvements should be coordinated with any planned SHA projects.

a. Problem
The intersection of MD 51 at Lamont Street is an unsignalized
intersection with stop control along the Lamont Street approach and
the parking lot/Thomas Street approach. Thomas Street is a lightly-
travelled roadway adjacent to a parking lot that intersects with MD 51
across from Lamont Street. Northbound MD 51 consists of a left turn
lane, two thru lanes, and a channelized right-turn lane with a
deceleration lane. Southbound MD 51 consists of a left turn lane, a thru
lane, and a shared thru/right-turn lane. Westbound Lamont Street has
a shared left-turn/thru lane and a channelized free right-turn lane with
a 500-foot acceleration lane. Eastbound Thomas Street consists of a
single-lane approach. The layout of the intersection is shown in Figure
15.

As expressed at the stakeholder meeting, safety is a concern for vehicles turning from Lamont Street and Thomas Street onto MD 51
due to the high vehicle speeds along MD 51 and lack of adequate sight distance. Sight distance for drivers making a left turn from
Lamont Street is 370 feet. Figure 16 shows the restricted sight distance here. Sight distance for drivers making a left turn from
Thomas Street is 5.55 feet. According to Exhibit 9-55 of the AASHTO Green Book, the minimum required sight distance for vehicles
making a left turn from a stop-controlled approach with a design
street of 50 mph along the intersecting roadway is 425 feet. The              FIGURE 16 ­ SIGHT DISTANCE RESTRICTION
Lamont Street approach does not meet this requirement. According to                     FROM LAMONT STREET
the Green Book, if a divided-highway median is wide enough to store
the design vehicle with a clearance to the through lanes of
approximately 3 feet at both ends of the vehicle, no separate analysis
for the departure sight triangle for left turns is needed on the minor-
road approach for the near roadway to the left. Vehicles looking to
make a thru movement or left turn from the Lamont Street and
Thomas Street approaches have to wait for sufficient gaps in traffic
along both directions of MD 51 in order to enter the intersection
because the median is narrow, and vehicles are therefore unable to
cross one direction of MD 51 and then dwell in the median while
waiting for an acceptable gap in traffic in the other direction of MD 51.
MD 51 has 11-foot-wide left-turn lanes along both directions, with a 7-
foot-wide median. This 18-foot-wide area is too narrow an area for
vehicles turning from Lamont Street or Thomas Street to safely dwell
while waiting for an adequate gap in traffic.

Between January 2006 and December 2008, there were 40 reported crashes at this intersection, including 14 T-type collisions and 14
rear end collisions. Table 20 below provides a summary of crash data at this intersection.

b. Proposed Solutions
Widening the median would allow left-turning vehicles along Lamont Street and Thomas Street to safely dwell in the median while
waiting for acceptable gaps in traffic. The 12-foot-wide deceleration lane from northbound MD 51 to eastbound Lamont Street and
the 12-foot-wide acceleration lane from westbound Lamont Street to northbound MD 51 would be removed, and the two northbound
MD 51 lanes would be shifted 12 feet to the east to provide for a 30-foot-wide median. The northbound right-turn lane would be
removed, and one of the northbound thru lanes would be converted to a shared thru/right-turn lane. Northbound right-turn
channelization would remain. There are currently 42 northbound right turns during the AM peak hour and 23 northbound right
turns during the PM peak hour. The westbound channelized right-turn lane would remain, but would be yield-controlled due to the
removal of the acceleration lane. SimTraffic analysis was performed under these conditions, and is summarized in Table 23. Detailed
SimTraffic output can be found in Appendix E. As shown, the proposed geometry will offer similar peak hour conditions to the
existing geometry.

Unfortunately, this layout would likely result in additional sight distance issues, and is therefore not recommended. Alternative
proposals restricting access are preferred. These proposals include the restriction of left turns and thrus from westbound Lamont
Street onto southbound MD 51 and the restriction of left turns from southbound MD 51 to Lamont Street. Vehicles from Lamont
Street wishing to access MD 51 to the south may do so by following the local roadway network to Virginia Avenue, which reaches
MD 51 via a signalized intersection. Vehicles traveling southbound along MD 51 wishing to access Lamont Street may do so by
traveling past Lamont Street and making a u-turn approximately 1,400 feet to the south at the intersection of MD 51 at 2nd Street, then
turning right onto Lamont Street. 6 AM/7 PM vehicles make a westbound left turn, and 0 AM/2 PM vehicles make a westbound thru
movement. 219 AM/325 PM vehicles make a westbound left turn.
c. Recommendation
Restrict thrus and left turns from Lamont Street, and restrict left turns from southbound MD 51. Install signing directing southbound
vehicles to make a u-turn at 2nd Street and then turn right onto Lamont Street. In addition, signing could be installed directing drivers
to use 1st Street to access southbound MD 51. Since this section of MD 51 is owned by SHA, improvement options should be
coordinated with SHA.

MD 51 is a one-way pair in the vicinity of Virginia Avenue. The eastbound
and westbound lanes of MD 51 are set approximately 200 feet apart, with
houses and businesses between the two sets of lanes. Westbound MD 51
consists of a shared left-turn/thru lane, a thru lane, and an approximately
250-foot-long shared thru/right-turn lane. The center lane and right-most
lane of westbound MD 51 merge approximately 1,150 feet downstream of
the intersection. Eastbound MD 51 consists of a shared left-turn/thru lane, a
thru lane, and a right-turn lane. Northbound Virginia Avenue consists of a
single-lane approach at eastbound MD 51, and has a separate 85-foot-long
left-turn bay at its approach to westbound MD 51. Southbound Virginia
Avenue consists of a single-lane approach at westbound MD 51 and has a
separate 50-foot-long left-turn bay at its approach to eastbound MD 51. The
layout of MD 51 at Virginia Avenue is shown in Figure 17.

Between January 2006 and December 2008, there were 17 reported crashes at
this intersection, all of which resulted in property damage only. Table 24
below provides a summary of crash data at this intersection.

MD 51 at Virginia Avenue consists of two signalized intersections that operate as one signal system. Eastbound and westbound thru
traffic run concurrently with a leading westbound left-turn/thru phase. Northbound and southbound traffic run on split phasing,
with the southbound phase preceding the northbound phase. There is an eight-second clearance phase for southbound Virginia
Avenue at eastbound MD 51 that occurs after the eastbound/westbound MD 51 phase and before the eastbound Virginia Avenue
phase. The signal is semi-actuated with camera-actuation along the Virginia Avenue approaches. This network experiences long
delay times and heavy queues. The network was analyzed using SimTraffic software. A summary of existing operations is shown in
Table 25, and detailed SimTraffic output can be found in Appendix E. As shown, the signal system operates at LOS C during the AM
peak hour and LOS D during the PM peak hour. The approach with the greatest delay is the southbound Virginia Avenue approach
to westbound MD 51, which operates under LOS D during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour.

Queuing was measured along the northbound Virginia Avenue approach to eastbound MD 51 during the PM peak hour on Tuesday,
March 2, 2010. The longest observed queue consisted of 28 vehicles. The second-longest queue consisted of 22 vehicles, which is
approximately the same as the 95th percentile queue determined in SimTraffic. Most queues were between 11 and 17 vehicles. Each
vehicle cleared the intersection on green during 19 of the 20 queues that occurred during this peak hour. The one queue that did not
clear contained 22 vehicles, 2 of which did not clear the intersection on green. One of these vehicles was able to turn right on red.
Additionally, there is a tight turning radius for vehicles turning right from eastbound MD 51 onto Virginia Avenue. While the
northbound Virginia Avenue stop bar is set back from the intersection in order to provide space for eastbound trucks to turn right,
conflicts occur when a northbound right-turning vehicle stops beyond the stop bar. These vehicles do so to look for an adequate gap
in eastbound traffic before turning right on red. When a northbound vehicle stops beyond the stop bar, the eastbound right-turning
truck must wait for the northbound vehicle to turn while the northbound vehicle waits for an acceptable gap in eastbound thru
traffic.

One proposal to improve the intersection involves                                             WESTBOUND MD 51 LEFT TURNS
altering the lane configuration along westbound MD
51 to provide for a separate left-turn lane. Under this
configuration, the left-most lane of westbound MD 51
would be converted to a dedicated left-turn lane, and
the other two lanes would serve as thru lanes. Under
the existing geometry, several thru vehicles travel in
the left-most lane along with left-turning vehicles.
When the left-turning vehicles queue back from the
eastbound MD 51 at Virginia Avenue signal, as shown
in Figure 18, the thru vehicles get trapped in this lane,
and are often unable to change lanes due to the lack of
adequate gaps in traffic in the center lane. By
converting the left-most lane to a dedicated left-turn
lane, thru vehicles would only travel in dedicated thru
lanes and would avoid getting trapped behind left-
turning vehicles. Currently, the three westbound lanes
merge to two lanes approximately 1,150 feet
downstream. If the left-most lane is converted to a
dedicated left-turn lane, then westbound MD 51 would
consist of two lanes west of Virginia Avenue, and there
would be no downstream merge.

Table 26 provides a summary of peak hour operations with the conversion of the left-most lane of westbound MD 51 to a dedicated
left-turn lane. Detailed SimTraffic output can be found in Appendix E. As shown, the intersections would operate at slightly
improved conditions during the PM peak hour compared to existing conditions. The 95th percentile queue for westbound traffic
during the PM peak hour would decrease from 268 feet to 242 feet.

Two other issues were also examined. Restricting northbound right turns on red would eliminate the possibility of northbound right-
turning vehicles blocking eastbound trucks from turning right, although this would increase average delay and queues along the
northbound approach. Currently, 208 vehicles make a northbound right turn during the AM peak hour. 201 vehicles make this
movement during the PM peak hour.

The other issue involves signal phasing. Currently, there is an eight-second clearance phase for southbound Virginia Avenue at
eastbound MD 51, which occurs after the eastbound/westbound MD 51 phase and before the southbound Virginia Avenue phase.
This phase allows vehicles that have made a westbound left turn onto Virginia Avenue to clear eastbound MD 51 before the vehicles
along southbound Virginia Avenue start. Overall, this results in the southbound phases having unused green time at the expense of
green time for other phases. As there are only 42 AM/65 PM southbound thru vehicles, it is advisable to combine the clearance phase

traffic volumes. The cycle length would be reduced from 180 seconds to 160 seconds during both peak hours. Table 27 summarizes

operations with all improvements implemented. Detailed SimTraffic output can be found in Appendix E. As shown, during both
peak hours, implementing these improvements will decrease delay at the intersection over the scenario of conversion of the left-most
lane of westbound MD 51 to a dedicated left-turn lane.

Finally, the installation of a "Michigan left" was investigated. In a Michigan left, some or all left-turn movements are prohibited, and
vehicles wishing to make this movement must instead turn around at a distance away from the intersection. Under this proposal, the
westbound lane of Virginia Avenue would be closed between the eastbound and westbound lanes of MD 51. Westbound left turns
would continue west along MD 51, make a u-turn at a turnaround lane onto eastbound MD 51, and finally turn right onto Virginia
Avenue. Southbound thrus and left turns from Virginia Avenue would have to turn right onto westbound Virginia Avenue, use the
turnaround lane to reach eastbound MD 51, and finally travel through the intersection of Eastbound MD 51 at Virginia Avenue.
Under this layout, the westbound left-turn phase would be eliminated, and northbound and southbound traffic could operate
concurrently, allowing the signal to operate on two-phase operations, and reducing the cycle length from 180 seconds to 60 seconds.

There are two proposed locations for the turnaround lane. Option A involves using the existing Springdale Street as a turnaround
lane. Under this option, construction of a traffic signal at the intersection of Eastbound MD 51 at Springdale Street would be required
as sight distance here may not be adequate for trucks wishing to turn from Springdale Street onto MD 51. Option B involves
constructing a new turnaround lane further west. Figures 19A and 19B display the proposed layouts of the two options. Tables 28A
and 28B summarize operations under this layout, and detailed SimTraffic output can be found in Appendix E.

a. Problem
                                                                                                        NEARBY ROADWAYS
The McMullen Bridge is located just north of downtown Cumberland
and serves traffic along eastbound Frederick Street and westbound
Bedford Street. It crosses over Henderson Avenue, Queen City Drive,
and the railroad tracks. A map of the access points to/from the east
side of the bridge is shown in Figure 20. The westbound lanes of the
bridge are not heavily traveled, due in part to the fact that the bridge
is accessed by one-way streets including Bedford Street, Independence
Street, and Polk Street. Drivers traveling along Henderson Avenue
wishing to access the westbound lanes of the bridge may do so by
turning onto eastbound Polk Street, turning left onto Columbia
Avenue and then turning right immediately onto eastbound Polk
Street, then turning right onto southbound Independence Street,
which terminates at the McMullen Bridge.
b. Proposed Solution/Recommendation
There is no signing in this area directing drivers to make these
movements. Install signing along Henderson Avenue, Polk Street,
Columbia Avenue, and Independence Avenue to direct traffic onto
this bridge. This could send more vehicles to this bridge as opposed to
other access points to downtown, including the intersections of Front
Street at Baltimore Street and Baltimore Street at Queen City Drive.

E. Vehicle Weaving Conflict

1. MD 51 Northbound at Canal Parkway
   Northbound Weave
a. Problem
The section of northbound MD 51 (Industrial Boulevard)
between the ramp from northbound Canal Parkway and
the signalized intersection of MD 51 with Queen City
Drive, Mechanic Street, Centre Street, Winston Street,
and the I-68 Ramps currently operates as a weave
section. The weave area of northbound MD 51 and the
ramp from northbound Canal Parkway is shown in
Figure 21. Northbound MD 51 consists of three lanes in
this area. At the south end of this section, there are two
lanes along MD 51, and the third lane is added on the
right from northbound Canal Parkway. At the north end
of this section, the left lane leads to northbound Centre
Street, northbound Mechanic Street, and the I-68 Ramps,
with an option to turn left onto Winston Street. The
center and right lanes lead to eastbound Queen City
Drive.
Vehicles traveling from northbound Canal Parkway
must perform two lane changes in an approximately 650-
foot-long segment to enter the lane of northbound MD 51
that leads to Centre Street, Mechanic Street, and the I-68
Ramps. Due to the relatively low traffic volumes,
conflicts here are infrequent. AM and PM peak hour
observations were conducted on October 22, 2009.
During the AM peak hour, there were three instances in
which vehicles from Canal Parkway wishing to merge
into the left-most lane of MD 51 had to slow down in
order to merge into that lane. During the PM peak hour,

                                                                                                                                     Page 62 of 65

there was one instance of a conflict caused by a long                                        FIGURE 22 ­ PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS TO
queue in the left lane at the intersection of MD 51 at                                         NORTHBOUND MD 51 WEAVE SECTION
Queen City Drive, Mechanic Street, Centre Street,
Winston Street, and the I-68 Ramps. In this instance, a
vehicle entering MD 51 from Canal Parkway waited
in the Canal Parkway ramp while waiting for the
queue in the left lane to clear, causing a queue to form
in the Canal Parkway ramp.
b. Potential Solutions
To minimize weaving, it is proposed that Canal
Parkway merge with MD 51 prior to the beginning of
the third lane, as shown in Figure 22. Canal Parkway
would merge with MD 51, and the third lane would
open downstream. This would allow Canal Parkway
traffic to merge with MD 51 traffic prior to when MD
51 traffic would attempt to enter the right-most lane.
The right-out access would be replaced with a stop-
controlled access point for vehicles along the
warehouse access road wishing to access MD 51 in
this area. This scenario may not be feasible due to the
grade separation between MD 51 and Canal Parkway.
Another way to address the weaving issue is to
change the lane configurations of MD 51 downstream
at the intersection of MD 51 at Queen City
Drive/Mechanic Street/Centre Street/Winston Street/I-
68 Ramps, as described in the previous section of this
report. Under both Alternative 1 and Alternative 2,
most drivers would be required to make fewer lane
changes, and the queue lengths will be shorter,
allowing a greater distance in which drivers may
enter their desired lane.

                                                                                                                                         Page 63 of 65

c. Recommendation
Make no changes to the existing geometry at this location. The improvements at the intersection of MD 51 at Queen City
Drive/Mechanic Street/Centre Street/Winston Street/I-68 Ramps will result in less weaving as well as a longer area in which vehicles
can change lanes.

                                             MEMORANDUM OF MEETING

·    Tom Hannan gave an introduction of the project to the Stakeholders. John DiFonzo approached WR&A to
     do a transportation study using County funds. In summary, WR&A had previously worked with John
     DiFonzo on the Ridgely, WV truck signing project. WR&A was brought on board due to the success of that
     project coupled with the need to address other issues in the City. John DiFonzo thanked the group for their
     participation.

·    The role of stakeholders is to help the project team (City and WR&A) identify problems in the City and to
     help prioritize solutions. The stakeholders can provide local knowledge and advise the project team on
     potential improvement alternatives. Stakeholder input during the process will also give study
     recommendations more weight when funding decisions are being considered.

     o    There are several components to the study, outlined below. John emphasized that some projects may
          have expensive solutions; however, the goal would be to focus on low cost solutions.

               Truck Routing/Signing ­ major component. City is broken up by water, rail, roads; not well defined
               as a grid network; out of towners/tourists need guide signing.

               Geometric Features Inventory/Assessment ­ roadway geometry, curb radii, etc.

               Traffic Operations Assessment

               ·    Device inventory (signals, signs, markings)

               ·    Crash data review ­ no major problems in City compared to statewide averages; stakeholders
                    may be aware of unreported property damage crashes, which do not show up in SHA's records.

     o    Data collection efforts will include conducting one week field study, outlined below. The project was
          scoped as a moderately budgeted project, which did not allow for a more exhaustive and expensive
          origin and destination study. WR&A will make use of City conducted traffic counts wherever possible.

               Signing inventory

               Tourist survey

               Train station license plate survey ­ where are people coming from/to

               Trucking industry survey of trucking industry reps ­ has been done in other areas; good information
               provided about problems/uses along their routes.

·    Jeremy Mocny began the brainstorming discussion by reviewing several issues that John emailed to WR&A
     at the beginning of the study. The issues are listed below generally in the order of the discussion. See
     attached for original list of issues.

     o    Lt. Leake ­ Truck drivers continue to get lost along the truck detour route on west side of town, which
          is in place due to a restricted vertical clearance railroad overpass on Greene Strett. The Allegany

          Street leg along the truck detour route is a problem. In addition, there have been complaints of
          trucks getting lost and stuck on Washington Street. Based on field observations prior to the meeting,
          signs are missing along the Greene Street truck detour. Need: " Truck Route" on northbound
          Allegany Street followed by "End Detour" sign on westbound Greene Street. Harold Hipsley agreed to
          follow-up on this. WR&A will investigate the truck detour route as part of the study.

     o    Baltimore and Mechanic ­ people push button and then cross on "Don't Walk" phase; signal changes
          and no pedestrians present, causing unnecessary delay; "Barnes Dance" operation. WR&A recommend
          adding standard pedestrian instructional sign.

     o    Allegany and Greene ­ "Barnes Dance" with Police Officer near elementary school

     o    Harold Hipsley ­ Coal trucks ­ 6 to 12 round trips per day; 1-15 trucks per day; origin is Berlin.

     o    Einer Johnson ­ Trucks could use Queen City Drive, but intersection of Queen City Drive and
          Mechanic can not be negotiated. Buses can negotiate the turn. Dave Umling mentioned that bike study
          looked at geometry.

     o    Lt. Leake ­ At times during the lunch hour trucks may occupy an entire block in the downtown area.

     o    Terri Bennett ­ Truck noise a problem for downtown businesses

     o    Harold Hipsley ­ Both Queen City Drive/Mechanic and Queen City Drive/Centre turns to MD 51 South
          have geometry problems for tractor trailers.

     o    Problem intersection of Queen City Drive and I-68 EB exit (Exit No. 43C). There are sight distance
          restrictions at the intersection due to the location of a bridge pier, as well as at the Citgo and Roy
          Rogers. I-68 was constructed first, and that when Queen City Drive was constructed the geometry of
          the roadway had to work with the existing bridge pier locations, resulting in the sight restrictions
          observed today. Queen City Drive is City-owned; MD 51 is state-owned. Stephen Bucy (SHA District
          6 Traffic Representative for George Small) mentioned that SHA has done studies of this intersection.

     o    Another problem intersection is MD 51 (Industrial Boulevard) and Virginia Avenue. Southbound right
          turns from MD 51 have difficulty making turns when northbound Virginia Avenue vehicles pull beyond
          the stop line; potentially prohibiting right-turns on red. SHA-maintained signal with long cycle length is
          a problem today. Stephen Bucy (SHA District 6 Traffic Representative for George Small) mentioned
          that SHA has done studies of this intersection, and implemented improvements over the years.

     o    Lt. Leake mentioned that Virginia Avenue is the only access point from Canal Parkway, which can lead
          to westbound left turn problems due to short spacing between signals.

     o    Field work should be accelerated to avoid temporary one-way pattern from September 2009 to 2010;
          resurfacing/curb/sidewalk; Lamont Street to Boulevard. Steve Bucy mentioned that patterns could
          change with the new hospital, Steve will provide TIS. The one-way operation is being evaluated by the
          City as a permanent change.

     o    Stephen Bucy mentioned that travel patterns on the East Side of town could change with the opening
          of the new hospital; Stephen will provide TIS.

     o    Harrison/Mechanic Street: westbound Harrison to southbound Mechanic, trucks can not make left turn.

     o    Einer Johnson ­ All signals operate isolated; he recommends linking Bedford, Baltimore, Harrison,
          Mechanic together and adding fire house pre-emption; no Opticom today. Interconnect cable is present
          in the handboxes, but there is not enough slack to connect the intersections; all intersections currently
          operate on fixed time operation, other problems: power outage creates problems; no detectors.

     o    Several issues were raised regarding the Canal Street and Baltimore Street intersection:

               The first issue was a traffic operations issue related to stacking across this intersection from the west
               leg of the Baltimore/Mechanic Street intersection. One recommendation was to prohibit westbound
               Baltimore Street left turns onto southbound Canal Street. Another complaint voiced is that news
               trucks take up a lot of space in this block. In addition to the current operational issues, future
               traffic problems could be added by a new Fairfield Inn planned for this area, with up to two
               restaurants proposed.
               The second issue dealt with the Great Allegheny Passage Trail crossing of Baltimore Street, which
               is located just west of the intersection with Canal Street. Einer Johnson mentioned that bikers don't
               understand the crossing operation and the intent of the warning lights. Terri Bennett mentioned that
               trail organization is working on signing that will instruct peds/bicyclists to use the flashing lights.
               John DiFonzo mentioned that a bike detector there may not be working; it was put in by Allegany
               County. Lt. Leake mentioned planned educational sessions to include distributing pamphlets about
               crossings. For now, the trail crossing will not be studied further as part of this study.
     o    On southbound Mechanic Street, left turns are prohibited at Pershing and Harrison. Potential
          solution: convert Mechanic Street to one-way northbound.

     o    Comment was made about the difficulty of trucks making left turns at the Mechanic Street at
          Pershing Street and Harrison Street intersections. One solution proposed for this section was to
          convert it to one-way southbound.

     o    Lt. Leake ­ Lamont Street at MD 51 (Industrial Boulevard) intersection has high velocity crash
          problems due to poor sight distance. Left turns from westbound Lamont to southbound MD 51 have to
          cross three lanes of northbound traffic to enter median opening.

     o    Question: Will the study address pedestrians/bicyclists issues? John DiFonzo will have WR&A
          coordinate with on-going bike trail and downtown studies and will coordinate traffic signing efforts.
          This study will primarily focus on truck/general routing, not tourism/ped/bike.

     o    Question: How will planning for US 220 upgrade to connect to Corridor H be integrated into this study?
          Dave Umling responded that alignments have not been set. John DiFonzo reiterated that consideration
          of Corridor H will not be part of this study.

     o    Harold Hipsley ­ Handicap parking permit holders have overwhelmed the use of on-street parking
          spaces.

     o    Albert Keener ­ It is easier to make right turns from side street/entrances to go south on Queen City
          Drive than it is to make left turns from side street/entrances to go north. This may be related to signal
          timing preferences. WR&A will investigate this issue further to determine the issues and possible
          options to recommend for improvement.

     o    Trucking related issues and comments included:

               Ed Miller ­ Cumberland would be the fourth town to study truck routing. Baltimore recently
               completed a study; New York has a very detailed truck routing map on their website. Use of the
               "jake brake" can not be prohibited; however, signs stating "Modified Exhaust Systems Prohibited"
               is an option.
               John DiFonzo ­ Deliveries to many businesses are now made by large trucks due to the `on-time
               delivery' approach to shipping.
               Bill Gray ­ Local trucking companies to contact: Pitt-Ohio, UPS Freight. Two companies have
               truck-specific GPS units: Cobra, Hendricks; providing them with truck route mapping would be a
               good way of reducing truck traffic on local streets.

               William Herbaugh and Kim Twigg ­ Northbound Canal Parkway "on-ramp" at MD 51 (Industrial
               Boulevard) ­ have weaving problems. In addition to the current operational issues, future traffic
               problems could be added by a new Fairfield Inn planned for this area, with up to two restaurants
               proposed.
     o    Teri Bennett ­ Maryland/Virginia/Oldtown intersection has an issue with trucks turning onto Virginia;
          vehicles can't make left turn onto Maryland from Virginia per Albert Keener.

·    Next meeting: December 8th 9th, which is the same day as the Allegany County Transportation Adv.
     Committee (Police, Maintenance, and Emergency personnel). Invitations will be sent out prior to the
     meeting with time and location.

Any participant wishing to amend the minutes is requested to notify the writer within seven (7) days.

Tom,
This reminded me that I have not sent you some information I came across. It is not as big as I though, so I am just
attaching it to this email.
In addition to that I wanted to mention a few others areas that I would like to see addressed in the study. They are as
follows:
     1. There are CSX Bridges with restricted weight limits on Cumberland Street, Fayette Street and Washington Street.
     2. That same track goes over Greene Street and it has a clearance of only 12' 10". Trucks are detoured onto a
          "Truck Route" which goes over the tracks (Allegany Street, Beall Street, and S. Lee Street) and the signing (or lack
          of good signing) may contribute to trucks getting onto streets they don't belong on.
     3. Washington Street is a residential street in the historic area of town, and we have received complaints about
          trucks that appear to be lost traveling on Washington Street. It may be possible that No. 2 contributes to this
          problem, but I am not sure.
     4. I have received a complaint about the need for a pedestrian light at S. Mechanic Street and Harrison Street,
          because of the number of cars that park near the train station or under I 68 and then walk to their jobs in the
          morning and afternoon. ( I understand this one may be out of the scope, but I thought I would mention it
          anyway.)
     5. We have received a request for a sign indicating that trucks are not allowed on Decatur Street, because they turn
          from Baltimore Avenue then can make the turn onto Fredrick Street at Decatur Street. The only problem I see
          with this request is that the intersection of Decatur Street and Frederick Street is like just about every
          intersection in Cumberland.
     6. Signs on the McMullen Bridge facing Fredrick Street at Centre Street direct travelers to Route 220 North, but Rte.
          40 and Rte. 220 were directed to and made part of I 68 years ago.
     7. We have some screwy lane markings on Greene Street east of Allegany Street in an attempt to allow a left turn
          lane onto Allegany Street from Greene Street. The same kind of left hand turn lane exists on Park Street at the
          Post Office. I think we know the answer, but it would be good to have a recommendation. I think we will need
          to eliminate a few parking spaces in both cases, and trying to keep this is what appears to be causing the
          problems.
     8. One of the primary complaints that we received and may have been the start of the need for this study is the
          coal truck traffic that sometimes uses Mechanic Street to connect to Route 51. AES, a power plant in Mexico
          Farms gets most of its coal from I-68 to Industrial Blvd. (Rt. 51) however we understand that some of the trucks
          come from Rte. 36. The shortest route from Rt. 36 to Rt. 51 S is Mechanic Street.
     9. A lot of truck traffic uses Virginia Avenue and that means they have to go under the CSX tracks near the CSX
          Yard. The road was lowered so that trucks no longer get stuck in the "sub-way" but the turns are a little hard to
          make for trucks. Don't think this one can be solved, but .....
     10. Our Historic Signs are old and faded and need to be replaced.
     11. The Downtown area does have some new informational signs, but even they need to be painted.
I am sure there are other places but wanted to make sure these received at least a good look during this study.
Thanks,
John

The purpose of this meeting was to discuss WR&A's preliminary findings and recommendations. The
following issues were discussed:

    ·    Issue #1: Trucks on Mechanic Street in Downtown
             o Options for detouring trucks around downtown were presented, Option B ­ the Queen
                City Drive route is the recommended option. Existing travel times through downtown
                need to be shown for comparison.
             o Left turn for trucks from WB Winston Street to SB Industrial Boulevard is problematic
                and may render the Mechanic Street to Industrial Boulevard truck detour impractical.
             o Trucks destined for I-68 need to be considered. WR&A will conduct a license plate
                study along Mechanic Street to determine what percent of trucks are destined for I-68
                (left turns at Harrison Street) versus Industrial Boulevard.
             o The Downtown Development Committee has been one of the driving forces for getting
                trucks off Mechanic Street. Their primary concerns are that trucks block intersections
                and rut the street. This should be sufficient rationale for diverting trucks onto the
                alternative route. Once the license plate study is complete a meeting will be scheduled

                                                                                                                                 03/15/2010


                with the MD Motor Trucking Association and coal trucking companies in Pennsylvania
                to discuss the detour option(s).
             o Einer is working on a solution for the flashing operation at the Baltimore/Queen City
                intersection; when the track preemption circuit is triggered, it will place the signal in
                flashing operation. WR&A will assess the effect of train preemption on the Mechanic
                Street to Queen City Drive truck diversion route
    ·    Issue #2:
             o An option was presented that restriped the southbound Mechanic Street approach to the
                intersection to provided only one shared left-thru lane to allow all vehicles to pass under
                the center of the restricted vertical clearance railroad arch, and removed parking on the
                westbound Queen City Drive approach to shift the travel lane north. The restriping on
                Mechanic Street may provide parking opportunities to offset the parking lost on Queen
                City Drive.
             o Continuous parking on east side of Mechanic Street approaching Queen City Drive is
                not feasible due to the presence of private driveways along this side of the roadway.
                WR&A will assess how many spaces can be created and whether the number of spaces
                lost on Queen City Drive by shifting the travel lane can be offset by adding parking on
                Mechanic Street.
    ·    Issue #3: Baltimore Street at Mechanic Street
             o The Baltimore Street detector is out of service
             o Einer provided the timing data; no timing sheet exists.
             o The signals along Mechanic Street are not coordinated and the interconnect system is
                incomplete or non-existent; time-based coordination suing GPS units is a possibility
                that WR&A will explore. WR&A will also assess the potential coordination patterns
                with and without the exclusive ped phase.
             o WR&A will develop several conceptual signal improvement options, with estimated
                costs for each. Since the City would use bond funds to fund the improvements,
                accessible pedestrian signals (APS) will not be required. The City wants the cost of
                making the complete set of improvements, not partial improvements.
             o Trucks often do not extend green interval when they move too slowly from the stop
                line, creating more congestion for all traffic.
             o A previous study showed level of service can be improved with a roundabout, but not
                with a signal.
    ·    Issue #4: Baltimore Street at Canal Street
             o Einer suggested making Canal Street one-way northbound to address the problem of
                westbound backups that disrupt the intersection of Baltimore/Mechanic. Vehicles
                destined for the Times-News could use Harrison Street to get there, but would have to
                travel on private property for part of the trip. In lieu of creating a one-way street,
                Jeremy suggested prohibiting left turns from Baltimore Street. John Chapman thought
                that this turn prohibition may be difficult to sign and enforce.
             o The parking lot with entry gate on the north side of Baltimore Street could also be a
                source of backups.
             o In the study of Baltimore/Mechanic signal improvement options, WR&A will assess the
                feasibility of adding near side indications at the railroad tracks and/or queue detection in

                the block east of the tracks to reduce blockages of the Canal Street intersection that
                contribute to the westbound queuing problems.
    ·    Issue #5: Baltimore Street at Washington Street/Cumberland Street/Greene Street
             o Check MUTCD for 3-way stop-controlled intersections; develop plan with options.
             o City has a contract or is on board to repave street.
             o IfCumberland Street were to operate one-way northbound (one option proposed), trucks
                may not be able to negotiate turns at Algonquin, and ambulances may not be able to
                make turns.
    ·    Issue #6: MD 51 at Queen City Drive/Mechanic Street/Centre Street/Winston Street/I-68
         Ramps
             o Most accidents may be ice-related.
             o Install "STOP ahead" sign on ramp?
             o SHA is forcing restaurant to do traffic study.
             o No detection for MD 51 and Mechanic Street approaches; operation as fully-actuated
                signal would reduce queuing.
             o Increasing green time from 34 seconds would reduce queuing.
             o Centre Street at Queen City Drive is currently operating under 4-way stop control.
    ·    There may be latent demand to use Mechanic Street ­ need to account for growth by a
         percentage.
    ·    Issue #7: SHA has signing ideas that coupled with improvements at MD 51 at Queen City
         Drive/Mechanic Street/Centre Street/Winston Street/I-68 Ramps may alleviate this issue.
    ·    Issue #8: MD 51 at Lamont Street
             o Accidents are severe due to high speed along MD 51.
             o Consider relocating southbound left turn to a u-turn.
             o This issue will be left for SHA to resolve since MD 51 is SHA owned.
    ·    Issue #9: MD 51 at Virginia Avenue
             o Improvement options were studied for this intersection, including implementing
                "Michigan Lefts". The resulting re-directed left turns include: truck turns are
                problematic on Springdale Street ­ short storage, possible sight distance problem, on-
                street parking.
             o Quebec Avenue at Industrial Boulevard has a Michigan Left.
             o Is 2nd Street/Cedar Street possible alternatives to Springdale Street?
    ·    Issue #10: McMullen Bridge ­ signed as "TO US 220"; re-sign as Bedford Street. The truck
         turning issue reported at Frederick and Decatur Streets will be added to this issue.
    ·    Results to be posted on the internet.

Traffic Impact Study - 03/22/12
Ulster Gardens Senior Living & Multi-Family Community


      SECTION 1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

      Warwick Properties, Inc. is proposing the subdivision of a 51.16± acre tax parcel into three
      parcels and the construction of a senior living and multifamily community, to be known as Ulster
      Gardens. The project site is located at 662 East Chester Street (NYS Route 9W) in the Town of
      Ulster and was the subject of a previously approved residential development that consisted of
      128 two-bedroom townhomes. An associated Statement of Findings was adopted June 16, 2009,
      by the Town of Ulster Planning Board (hereinafter referred to as the `Statement of Findings')
      and was the basis for this approval. The 51.16± acre tax parcel currently contains a single family
      residence and is identified on the Town of Ulster Tax Map as Section 48.58 Block 7 Lot 21.10.
      The previously approved project was never constructed.
      The proposed project consists of the construction of 112 one-bedroom senior living units and 52
      multifamily units (42 one-bedroom, 8 two-bedroom, and 2 three-bedroom). The currently
      proposed project represents a reduction in the total number of bedrooms from 256 to 176, in
      addition to limiting the occupancy of 112 of the dwelling units to persons over 65 years of age
      (two buildings located in the R-10 zoning district).
      The proposed project will have two points of access onto NYS Route 9W, also known as Chester
      Street Bypass. The northern access point will be via a connection to the existing Quail Drive and
      through to Van Kleeck Lane. As suggested by the Town of Ulster, this access point will be
      limited to passenger vehicles only. The southern access point will be via Memorial Drive. All
      the truck traffic will travel only through this access point. The propose project will provide a
      new access roadway to both Quail Drive and Memorial Drive.
      The Study follows accepted national engineering practice and utilizes accepted engineering data
      sources and software analysis programs. Field reviews were undertaken and manual vehicle
      turning counts were competed for the study intersections. The TIS methodology is detailed in
      Section 2.2 Study Methodology. All field data and analysis results are presented in the various
      Appendices to this report.
      Specifically, the TIS reviewed and analyzed the following intersections:
                 NYS Route 9W and Van Kleeck Lane.
                 NYS Route 9W and Memorial Drive.
      The TIS reviewed and analyzed the above noted two locations for 2012 Existing, 2013 No-Build,
      2013 Build, and 2018 (2013 Build + 5 Years) conditions.
      The analysis undertaken showed that the traffic generated by proposed project will not have any
      significant impact on the study locations, as detailed in Section 5.0 Analysis, and summarized in
      Section 6.0 Conclusions/Findings.




                                                                                    The Chazen Companies   1

Ulster Gardens Senior Living & Multi-Family Community


      SECTION 2.0 INTRODUCTION
      Section 2.1 Project Description and Location
      This Traffic Impact Study (TIS) was completed for the applicant to identify and quantify the
      traffic impacts associated with the proposed Ulster Gardens Senior Living and Multi-Family
      Community, located between Quail Drive and Memorial Lane, and to identify any recommend
      mitigation for those impacts where appropriate. The Study follows accepted national engineering
      practice and utilizes accepted engineering data sources, software analysis programs, as well as
      discussions with the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) on January 9,
      2012, and 02/01/12 TIS review comments from NYSDOT received March 15, 2012.

      The proposed project consists of four 3-story buildings. Two of buildings consist of 56 one-
      bedroom senior living units each and the other two buildings consist of 26 multi-family housing
      units each. The multi-family portion of the proposed project will consist of 42 one-bedroom
      units, 8 two-bedroom units and the remaining 2 three-bedroom units. The project is located on
      the east side of NYS Route 9W, between the intersection with Van Kleeck Lane and the
      intersection with Memorial Drive, in the Town of Ulster, Ulster County, New York. Access to
      the project site will be via two proposed access points off Quail Drive and Memorial Drive. It is
      noted that the intersection of Van Kleeck Lane and Quail Drive was observed, but not analyzed.

      Figure 1 shows the project site location relative to the general geographic area. Figure 2 shows
      the project site location, study area limits and the roadway network immediately adjacent to the
      site including the intersection that would likely be affected by the trips generated by the
      proposed project.

      Measurement of possible impact to traffic flow on the adjacent roadway network can be
      determined by reviewing the capacity changes to the local intersections and access points within
      the roadway network that result from application of the site generated traffic. The intersections
      deemed to be critical from a potential traffic impact perspective are the NYS Route 9W/Van
      Kleeck Lane and NYS Route 9W/Memorial Drive, as per field observations and at the request of
      NYSDOT.

      Traffic counts were conducted on Tuesday, January 17, 2012 between the hours of 4:00 PM and
      6:00PM and on Wednesday, January 18, 2012 from 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM. The counts were
      conducted during a weekday in an effort to capture typical weekday traffic conditions. There
      was no pedestrian activity observed during the peak hours at both study intersections.

      The operating conditions at the study intersections and the surrounding area were reviewed and
      analyzed, and recommendations were advanced to accommodate traffic activity associated with
      the project. It is anticipated that completion of the proposed development will occur in 2013;
      therefore 2013 is to be considered the build year for the Ulster Gardens Senior Living and Multi-
      Family Community project.

      Section 2.2 Study Methodology
      The following is a brief description of the detailed tasks, which were a part of the analysis.

                 Information pertinent to the existing traffic and roadway conditions was collected and
                 analyzed relative to its affect on safe and efficient operating characteristics.

                 Communication with the Town of Ulster, the New York Department of Transportation,
                 and other pertinent entities were undertaken to obtain the most up to date information
                 relevant to the study.

                 Field observations were made to observe the traffic movements within the existing
                 roadway network to determine traffic patterns and distributions.

                 Manual vehicular traffic counts were conducted for the key or critical intersections that
                 would be impacted by site generated traffic.

                 A trip generation analysis was conducted for the proposed land use components of the
                 development.

                 A directional distribution analysis was conducted to distribute site-generated traffic.

                 Operational analysis for NYS Route 9W and the intersections with Van Kleeck Lane and
                 Memorial Drive were conducted to determine if mitigating measures would be necessary
                 to maintain current operating conditions.

      Throughout this study, distinction is made between the Existing traffic, i.e. traffic currently
      accommodated on the roadway network; No-Build traffic, i.e. traffic anticipated to exist on the
      system without the proposed project in the anticipated build year; and Build traffic, i.e. the
      combination of No-Build and site or project generated traffic volumes.

      Section 3.1.2 Intersections
      The intersections of NYS Route 9W/Van Kleeck Lane and NYS Route 9W/Memorial Drive
      were analyzed relative to geometric and operating characteristics. These characteristics define
      the parameters used in the capacity analysis for each location. Two other intersections Quail
      Drive/Van Kleeck Lane and Quail Drive/Ledge Road were observed, but not analyzed to provide
      a complete picture of the local roadway network.
      The NYS Route 9W/Van Kleeck Lane intersection is located to the north of the project site. It
      is an un-signalized four way intersection. Intersection control is limited to a stop sign on the
      westbound Van Kleeck Lane approach. The eastbound Volvo Rents driveway approach is
      uncontrolled.

      The NYS Route 9W northbound and southbound approaches consist of a 12-foot single lane, for
      shared travel movements. The Van Kleeck Lane westbound and the Volvo Rents driveway
      eastbound approaches also consist of single lanes for shared travel movements.

      There are no pedestrian facilities (such as crosswalks, sidewalks, bike lanes, etc.) provided at this
      intersection. There are no public bus stops at this location. Pavement markings and signing on
      NYS Route 9W are in good to fair condition, and conform to the National MUTCD and NYS
      Supplement to the MUTCD. The stop bar on Van Kleeck Lane is poor condition (almost
      nonexistent).
      The NYS Route 9W/Memorial Drive intersection is located at the southern end of project site.
      It is an un-signalized three leg intersection control by a stop sign on the westbound Memorial
      Drive approach. The NYS Route 9W northbound and southbound approaches, as well as the
      Memorial Drive eastbound approach consist of a 12-foot single lane, for shared travel
      movements.

      There are no pedestrian facilities (such as crosswalks, sidewalks, bike lanes, etc.) provided at this
      intersection. There are no public bus stops at this location. Pavement markings and signing on
      NYS Route 9W are in good to fair condition, and conform to the National MUTCD and NYS
      Supplement to the MUTCD. The stop bar on Memorial Drive is in poor condition (almost
      nonexistent).

      The Quail Drive/Van Kleeck Lane intersection is an un-signalized, three leg intersection
      controlled by a stop sign on the eastbound and northbound approaches. All approaches at this
      intersection consist of single lanes for shared travel movements. There are no pedestrian facilities
      (such as crosswalks, sidewalks, bike lanes, etc.), nor pavement markings/striping provided at this
      intersection.

      The Quail Drive/Ledge Road intersection is an un-signalized, three leg intersection with no
      traffic control. Quail Drive continues southerly after the intersection for approximately 130 Feet
      and then dead ends. All approaches at this intersection consist of single lanes for shared travel
      movements. There are no pedestrian facilities (such as crosswalks, sidewalks, bike lanes, etc.),
      nor pavement markings/striping provided at this intersection.

      Section 3.2 Existing Traffic Volumes
      Existing peak hour traffic volumes at the evaluated intersection was documented via manual
      vehicular turning movement counts conducted on Tuesday, January 17, 2012 from 4:00 p.m. to
      6:00 p.m. (PM Peak Hours) and on Wednesday, January 18, 2012 from 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM
      (AM Peak Hours). The timeframes selected correspond to historically observed peak periods of
      vehicular activity on the adjacent roadway network. The peak hour volumes consist of the
      highest consecutive 60 minutes observed volumes at the study intersection. The raw turning
      movement counts are included in Appendix A. Based upon the traffic count data collected the
      following observations are evident:

                   The morning peak hour of traffic at the study intersections occurred from 7:30 to 8:30
                   a.m. The afternoon peak hour of traffic occurs from 4:45 to 5:45 p.m.

                   The two-way traffic volume on NYS Route 9W is approximately 795 vehicles during
                   the AM peak hour and approximately 1,050 vehicles during the PM peak hour.

                   3.0% of the total traffic volume at the intersections was comprised of heavy vehicles
                   during the AM peak hour and 2.3% during the PM peak hour.

                   2.8% of the total traffic volume at the intersection was comprised of school busses
                   during the AM peak hour and 0.2% during the PM peak hour.

                   Project #: 31134.00                                                 Date: January 2012            Figure: #3
Traffic Impact Study - 03/22/12
Ulster Gardens Senior Living & Multi-Family Community


      Section 3.3 No-Build Traffic Volumes
      The No-Build traffic volumes were generated using the existing traffic volumes and projecting
      them into the build year of 2013 using an estimated growth rate factor based on previous traffic
      growth trends in the area. A growth rate of 1% per annum, based on NYSDOT data, was applied
      to the 2012 existing traffic volumes to project the future traffic conditions in the year of 2013
      without the proposed project. The 1% growth rate is inclusive of normal development in the
      immediate area.
      The Town of Ulster was contacted to gather information about other major projects in area that
      are presently in the approval process and would generate traffic having a significant impact on
      the local roadway system. They have indicated that only one other project to be completed prior
      to Ulster Gardens Senior Living and Multi-Family Community; a 14,220 square feet building
      consisting of 20% office space and 80% warehouse space, is proposed at the corner of NSY
      Route 9W and Memorial Drive, with its access point to Memorial Drive. Traffic generated by
      this development is expected to travel through the study intersection of NYS Route
      9W/Memorial Drive, and accordingly, traffic generated by this development is added to the 1%
      growth rate for the No-Build analysis.
      The Town of Ulster also mentioned the proposed Millen's Recycling project which will involve
      the redevelopment of the existing ProBuild facility located to the west of NYS Route 9W with
      access to and from Keifer Street (just south of the Memorial Drive/NYS Route 9W intersection).
      While it is our understanding that the project sponsor states that this project will not have a
      significant impact to the traffic operations on NYS Route 9W, it is expected to generate 75 trips
      daily. Accordingly 10% of the daily trips will be assigned to Route 9W in the study area for both
      peak periods studied for the No-Build analysis.
      Figure 4 shows the projected 2013 vehicular volumes for the weekday AM and PM peak period,
      referred to as the No-Build condition. These volumes are those anticipated in 2013 without the
      proposed Ulster Gardens Senior Living and Multi-Family Community project.
      This information is utilized as the foundation volumes in 2013 to which the anticipated
      generation of the proposed project is added to predict the combined, or Build volumes
      anticipated in 2013.

      SECTION 4.0 VEHICULAR TRIP GENERATION AND BUILD
      VOLUMES
      Section 4.1 Trip Generation Analysis
      The generation analysis for a proposed senior living and multi-family community provides the
      anticipated traffic impact that can be expected as a result of that development. The Institute of
      Transportation Engineers (ITE) provides traffic and transportation professionals with a source
      document as a guide to trip generation rates for all land uses and building types. This document,
      Trip Generation Manual1, 8th Edition, is updated periodically and details rates developed for the
      average weekday during the peak hours of the generator and during the peak hours of the
      adjacent roadway traffic.

      The following ITE land uses most closely resembled the proposed project land use and as such
      were analyzed to determine the overall estimate of trips generated by the proposed project and
      using the existing local roadway network.

                 Land Use 220 ­ Apartment: Apartments are defined as rental dwelling units with at least
                 three other units in a common building.

                 Land Use 252 ­ Senior Adult Housing - Attached: This land use is defined as attached
                 independent living developments, including retirement communities, age-restricted
                 housing and active adult communities.

      The ITE defines a trip or trip end as "A single or one-direction vehicle movement with either the
      origin or destination (exiting or entering) inside a study site. For trip generation purposes, the
      total trip ends for a land use over a given period of time are the total of all trips entering and all
      trips exiting a site during a designated time period."2

      Table 2 details the forecasted vehicular trip generation values for the proposed development.

      Certain land uses are assigned "pass-by" trips, or trips that are on the roadway network for one
      purpose and make a second stop at the studied land use. An example of a pass-by trip would be a
      person on the way home from work that stops to pick up groceries or gets gas. The trip to the
      grocery store or gas station is not the primary reason for that vehicle being on the roadway
      network. Pass-by trips are usually not associated with the land uses studied for the proposed
      project, and are not included in the trip generation analysis.



      Section 4.2 Vehicular Directional Distribution and Assignment
      The distribution of the site generated vehicular traffic is based upon the land-uses being proposed
      and the marketing demographics based upon regional considerations. If the land-uses being
      proposed are consistent with existing activity then the new traffic flows would approximate the
      distribution of the existing volumes at the locations monitored during the manual counts.

      The traffic generated by the proposed land uses for this project (Apartments and Senior Adult
      Housing ­ Attached) was distributed as requested by NYSDOT. It is expected that during both
      weekday peak hours, 50% of the trips generated by the proposed project will travel using the
      Quail Drive access point and 50% will be using the Memorial Drive access point. The
      percentages of site generated traffic assigned to the study intersection are shown in Figure 5.

      Figures 6 depict site generated traffic volumes for the weekday AM and PM peak periods. These
      volumes were added to the corresponding No-Build values resulting in the 2013 Build traffic
      volumes shown in Figure 7.
      The Existing, No-Build, and Build traffic volumes were used in the assessment of impacts on
      traffic capacity.


       Section 4.3 2018 Build Volumes
      Additional analysis was conducted for the time frame of five (5) years after project completion
      or 2018. A 1% growth rate per year was applied to the 2013 Build volumes to arrive at the 2018
      volumes, presented in Figure 8

      SECTION 5.0 ANALYSIS
      Section 5.1 Intersection Level of Service
      The capacity analysis methodology is based upon the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual.3 The
      terminology employed to identifying traffic flow conditions is the computed "Level-of-Service"
      (LOS) based upon the calculated average delay per vehicle. LOS A represents the best condition
      and LOS F represents the worst. A LOS C is generally used as a design standard while an
      intersection LOS D is acceptable during peak periods if all approaches have LOS D or better.
      LOS E represents an operation at or near capacity. For un-signalized intersections, the average
      vehicle delay is computed for each critical movement to the intersection, which are normally the
      stop or yield controlled approaches along with the left-turns from the main roadways. A
      summary of the level-of-service designation for an un-signalized intersection, based on vehicle
      delay, is provided in Table 2.

                    C                                          >15.0 to 25.0
                    D                                          >25.0 to 35.0
                    E                                          >35.0 to 50.0
                    F                                               >50.0


      The study intersections were analyzed during the weekday AM and PM peak hour periods
      considered using Existing (2012), No-Build (2013), Build (2013) and Build (2018) traffic
      volumes. The capacity analyses were undertaken with the use of the highway capacity software
      (HCS 2000), based upon 2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology. The procedure is based
      on the total elapsed time from when a vehicle stops at the end of the queue until the vehicle
      departs from the stop line. The average total delay for any particular critical movement is a
      function of the service rate or capacity of the approach and the degree of saturation. Intersection
      Level of Service (LOS) and capacity analysis relate traffic volumes to the physical
      characteristics of an intersection. The average amount of vehicle delay is computed for each
      critical movement to the intersection.

      The results of the analysis for both un-signalized intersections show good vehicular movement
      levels of service for 2012 existing condition and are maintained throughout the 2013 Build
      conditions with minimal increases in vehicle delay. The side street approaches at both
      intersections, Van Kleeck Lane and Memorial Drive, will operate at LOS C during the AM and
      PM peak periods for all conditions, while the NYS Route 9W movements operate at LOS A for
      all conditions even after full build-out of the proposed project. The additional traffic directed
      toward both study intersections will not affect the service levels on any of the intersection
      approaches. Therefore, no mitigation is necessary at the study intersections. These results are
      carried through 2018 as indicated by the excellent to good levels of service shown in Table 3

Traffic Impact Study - 03/22/12
Ulster Gardens Senior Living & Multi-Family Community


      SECTION 6.0 SUMMARY AND COMCLUSIONS
      This Traffic Impact Study has analyzed the impact of traffic generation forecast for the proposed
      Ulster Gardens Senior Living and Multi-Family Community project in relationship to the
      existing and future traffic conditions of the adjacent roadway network for the Proposed Action.
      The following findings are the result of this analysis and are meant to provide an informed basis
      for the local decision making process.

                 In order to facilitate access to the proposed senior living and multi-family project, as
                 recommended, the project will extend Quail Drive in both the northerly and southerly
                 direction to connect to the existing Quail Drive and Memorial Drive respectively. Quail
                 Drive at Ledge Road and at Memorial Drive should be under stop sign control, with the
                 appropriate pavement markings.

                 As requested by the Town of Ulster, all heavy vehicular traffic should only enter and exit
                 the proposed project only via Memorial Drive. In order to keep heavy vehicles from
                 entering and/or exiting through Van Kleeck Lane, it is recommended the installation of a
                 "No Trucks" signs at Van Kleeck Lane and Quail Drive, prior to construction of the
                 project.

                 The intersections of Van Kleeck Lane with NYS Route 9W and Memorial Drive with
                 NYS Route 9W will both continue to operate at good intersection levels of service of
                 LOS A and C through the 2013 Build year, under each of the existing lane designations.
                 No improvements are recommended.

                 It is recommended that the pavement markings be installed on the Van Kleeck Lane and
                 Memorial Drive approaches to NYS Route 9W, including lane striping and stop bars.

      Given these conclusions resulting from this Traffic Impact Study, the Ulster Gardens Senior
      Living and Multi-Family Community as proposed for completion in 2013 will not have a
      significant impact upon the traffic and safety operating conditions on the adjacent roadway
      network, either in 2013 the year of project completion or in 2018, five years after project
      completion.

                           Appendix B: Level of Service Analysis
                      Level of Service (LOS) Definition ­ Signalized Intersections

The following information is obtained from the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM).

The Level of Service for a signalized intersection is defined in terms of control delay, which is a
measure of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and increased travel time. The delay
experienced by a motorist is made up if a number of factors that relate to control, geometrics, traffic and
incidents. The total delay is the difference between the travel time actually experienced and the
reference travel time that would result during base conditions: in the absence of traffic control,
geometric delay, any incidents, and any other vehicles. Specifically, LOS criteria for traffic signals are
stated in terms of the average control delay per vehicle, typically for a 15 minute analysis period. Delay
is a complex, measure and depends on a number of variables, including the quality of progression, the
cycle length, the green ratio, and the v/c ratio for the lane group. Levels of Service are defined to
represent reasonable ranges in control delay. The Level of Service criteria are described as follow:

                         Level of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections

 LOS    Control Delay       Description
        (sec/veh)
                            This LOS occurs when progression is extremely favorable and most vehicles
  A            10.0
                            do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may tend to contribute to low delays.
                            This LOS generally occurs with good progression, short cycle lengths, or
  B      >10.0 to 20.0
                            both. More vehicles stopping, causing higher levels of delay.
                            This LOS has higher delays that may result from only fair progression, longer
                            cycle lengths, or both. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this
  C      >20.0 to 35.0      level, which occurs when a given green phase does not serve queued vehicles,
                            and overflows occur. The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this
                            level, though many vehicles still pass through without stopping.
                            At this LOS, the amount of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer
                            delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long
  D      >35.0 to 55.0
                            cycle lengths, and high v/c ratios. Many vehicles stopping and too many will
                            pass through without stopping. Individual cycle failures are noticeable.
                            This LOS experience high delays that generally indicate poor progression,
   E     >55.0 to 80.0      long cycle lengths, and high v/c ratios. Frequent individual cycle failures are
                            experienced.
                            This LOS is considered unacceptable to most drivers. It often occurs with
                            oversaturation, when arrival flow rates exceed the capacity of lane groups. It
   F          >80.0         may also occur at high v/c ratios with many individual cycle failures. Poor
                            progression and long cycle lengths may also contribute significantly to high
                            delay levels.
                     Level of Service (LOS) Definition ­ Unsignalized Intersections

The four measures used to describe the performance of two-way stop controlled intersections are control
delay, delay to the major street, queue length, and v/c ratio. Control delay is the primary measure that is
used to provide an estimate of level of service. This measure can be estimated for any movement on the
minor street controlled by a stop sign. A delay estimate for each minor street movement and minor
street approach can be achieved by summing delay estimates for individual movements. The Level of
Service criteria are described as follow:

                         Level of Service Criteria for Unsignalized Intersections

               LOS                                   Control Delay (sec/veh)
                 A                                             10.0
                 B                                         >10.0 to 15.0
                 C                                         >15.0 to 25.0
                 D                                         >25.0 to 35.0
                 E                                         >35.0 to 50.0
                 F                                             >50.0

For the all-way stop controlled intersections, the average control delay is used as the primary measure of
performance. Control delay is the increased time of travel for a vehicle approaching and passing
through an all-way stop controlled intersection, compared with a free-flow vehicle if it were not required
to slow down or stop at the intersection.

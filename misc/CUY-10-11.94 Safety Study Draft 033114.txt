    INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE AND NEED
The purpose of this study is to evaluate existing safety performance and to identify potential
countermeasures to reduce traffic crashes and congestion at the intersection of State Route 10 (Lorain
Avenue) and County Route 25 (West 117th Street) in the city of Cleveland, Ohio. This section of State
Route 10, at M.P. 11.94 is ranked 39 on the ODOT 2012 Urban Intersection Peak Searching Excess
Locations (2010-2012).

A review of crash data provided by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) yielded a total of
81reported crashes within the study area during a 3-year period from 2010 to 2012. Of the total reported
crashes, 37.0 percent resulted in injury (no fatalities), which is higher than the statewide average of 25.4
percent for injury crashes on state route, non-freeway locations during the same period.

The following crash types and conditions are over-represented in the study area compared to statewide
averages (shown in parenthesis). It should be noted that the statewide crash averages are based on 2008-
2012 data whereas the project data encompasses years 2010 to 2012.
    >   Total crashes: 81 total crashes
    >   Rear end: 40 crashes or 49.4 percent                                         (30.9 percent)
    >   Left turn: 13 crashes or 16.0 percent                                         (5.2 percent)
    >   Sideswipe-Passing: 12 crashes or 14.8 percent                                 (8.7 percent)
    >   Pedalcycles: 1 crash or 1.2 percent                                           (0.6 percent)
    >   Ages 16-25 and 61+: 20 crashes or 24.7 percent                               (22.0 percent)

The top three crash types are rear end, left turn and sideswipe-passing, accounting for over 80 percent of
the total crashes.

BACKGROUND
State Route 10 (Lorain Avenue) is an east-west route that parallels Interstate 90 (I-90) and Interstate 71
(I-71) in Cleveland, Ohio. West 117th Street is a north-south roadway which is designated as County
Route 25. Lorain Avenue, west of West 117th Street is classified as other principal arterial. Lorain
Avenue, east of West 117th Street is classified as a minor urban arterial. Neighborhood commercial land
uses dominate this area of the intersection. A project location map is provided in Figure 1.
Two projects/studies are of interest to the State Route 10 (Lorain Avenue) and West 117th Street
intersection:
    >   A resurfacing project is currently being designed for Lorain Avenue from West 150th Street
        (CUY-10-10.14) to West 117th Street (PID 84289), with an estimated construction date of
        September 30, 2017.
    >   A TLCI Study was completed in December 2011, "Variety Village Streetscape Plan: Concepts for
        reinvesting in a vibrant, active, pedestrian friendly commercial district", which recommended a
        commercial center along Lorain Avenue at Variety Village. The study area consisted of Lorain
        Avenue from West 123rd Street to West 115th Street (including the West 117th Street intersection).
        Study recommendations included a pedestrian activated traffic signal at West 118th Street -- less
        than 300 feet from the signalized intersection of West 117th Street.

    EXISTING CONDITIONS
ROADWAY AND INTERSECTION CONDITIONS
West 117th Street intersects Lorain Avenue at a signalized intersection approximately 1/3 of a mile south
of the interchange with I-90. Lorain Avenue is a standard 4-lane section (two lanes in each direction)
without dedicated turn lanes plus on-street parking. West 117th Street is two-lanes in each direction with
dedicated left turn lanes at the intersection and
a two way left turn lane (TWLTL) between FIGURE 2: INTESECTION ALIGNMENT
intersections.




                                                                           West 117th
Lorain Avenue intersects West 117th Street at
a skewed angle of approximately 65 degrees
as illustrated in Figure 2. The intersection




                                                                           St
skew is within acceptable limits outlined in the
ODOT Location and Design Manual, since the
intersection is signalized (L&D Manual,
Volume 1, Section 401.3: Crossroad
Alignment). Due to the alignment and the
presence of buildings at back of sidewalk,
sight distance can be restricted in some               Lorain Ave
quadrants of the intersection. Photo 1 shows
the building located on the southwest corner of
the intersection near the intersection.
                                                                    ~65o

The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority                                           Receptacle
(RTA) operates two bus routes through the
intersection. The 22: Lorain Avenue route operates
along Lorain Avenue with a frequency of 3 to 4 buses per hour during the AM and PM peak periods in
both the eastbound and westbound directions. There are near side bus stops located on Lorain Avenue on
both approaches to the intersection. The 78: West 117-Puritas route operates along West 117th Street
with a frequency of 1 to 2 buses per hour during the AM and PM peak periods northbound and
southbound. There are two bus stops located to the north of the intersection on West 117th Street on both
                                                 the northbound and southbound directions.           The
PHOTO 3: SOUTH ALONG WEST 117TH STREET location of the bus stops contributes to the high volume
                                                 of pedestrians observed at the intersection. Right turn

                                                             with significant large potholes.        Vehicles were
                                                             observed to be stopping abruptly and swerving to avoid

TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONDITIONS
The Lorain Avenue and West 117th Street intersection is controlled with a traffic signal using mast arm
signal supports. Other features of the existing traffic signal include the following:
    >    The southbound and eastbound approaches operate with a lead protected phase.
    >    The cycle length is 110 seconds and is coordinated north-south along West 117th Street.
    >    The southbound and eastbound lead phases have 3 seconds of yellow indication and 1second of
         all red time. The phases for through traffic on Lorain Avenue and West 117th Street have 4
         seconds of yellow indication and 2 seconds of all red time.
    >    Crosswalks, pedestrian signal heads and pushbuttons are provided on all legs of the intersection.
    >    Right turns on red are prohibited on all intersection approaches.

There are signalized intersections located in close proximity on all approaches of the intersection.

    >    800 feet to the west at West 120th Street
    >    630 feet to the north at Triskett Road
    >    1,090 feet to the south at Governor Avenue

BUSINESS ACCESS AND PARKING
The functional area of an intersection includes the area proximate to the physical intersection of two
roadways. The functional area for a leg of an intersection includes two components: one upstream of the
physical area of the intersection and one downstream. The upstream (or intersection approach) includes
the area for decision-making, maneuvering, and required vehicle storage. The downstream area consists
of a conflict overlap distance that allows a through vehicle to clear the intersection in addition to
downstream conflict points. The downstream distance is calculated to be 155 feet and is based on a
design speed of 25 MPH. The functional area of a typical intersection is shown in Figure 3.

There are some commercial property driveways within the functional area of the intersection and on-street
parking is present along Lorain Avenue.
    >    A Family Dollar and Checks Cashed store is located on the northeast quadrant of the intersection
         with an access point on West 117th Street. The access is located 115 feet from the edge of the
         intersection of Lorain Avenue/W. 117th with parking directly adjacent to the back of sidewalk.
    >    A strip commercial development is located on the southeast quadrant of the intersection. Fidelity
         Avenue intersects with West 117th Street less than 100 feet from Lorain Avenue. There is an
         access point on Lorain Avenue approximately 200 feet east of the Lorain Avenue/W. 117th
         intersection.
    >    A parking lot next to a vacant office building is located on the northwest quadrant of the
         intersection; the parking lot shares an access point with a parking lot for a Rite Aid drug store.
         The access is located approximately 75 feet north of the Lorain Avenue/W. 117th intersection.
    >    The Family Medicine Center is located on the southwest quadrant with an access point on West
         117th Street, located approximately 100 feet south of the Lorain Avenue/W. 117th intersection.
During field observations, there were substantial PHOTO 5: EASTBOUND ALONG LORAIN AVENUE
amounts of snow piled along the roadway.
Particularly in the eastbound direction, shown in
Photo 4, motorists were forced to merge into a
single lane due to a parked car on the far side of
the intersection, which caused aggressive driving
behavior. The presence of piled snow caused the
parked cars to park further from the curb and
consequently encroaches into the outside travel
lane. There is no parking space designation
beyond the intersection on eastbound Lorain
Avenue. Parked cars were parked near the
intersection, which exacerbated the potential PHOTO 4: PARKING EASTBOUND ON LORAIN AVENUE
conflict for vehicles traveling eastbound through
the intersection.
On-street parking is permitted on Lorain
Avenue. On the eastbound and westbound
approaches there are bus stops in proximity to
the intersection which eliminate parking directly
adjacent to the intersection. On the westbound
receiving leg, there is a signed no parking zone
within approximately 60 feet beyond the                                           PARKED VEHICLE
crosswalk. The eastbound receiving leg has no                                        JUST BEYOND

parking within a few feet of the crosswalk as
shown in Photo 5 and Figure 4.

Access locations within the intersection area   are
shown in Figure 4. The photograph shows         the
number of access points (red circles) that      are

LAND USE
Land uses within the study area consist of a neighborhood commercial center at the subject intersection
surrounded by residential property. Several schools are also located near the study area. McKinley
Elementary School is located west of the study area on West 125th Street. Wilbur Wright Middle School is
located east of the study area along Bosworth Road. Both schools are located approximately 1,600 feet
away from the intersection. While access to these schools does not exist within the study area, traffic
patterns and volumes may be affected.

DATA COLLECTION
Manual turning movement counts, provided by the City of Cleveland, were collected at the Lorain
Avenue and West 117th Street intersection on November 14, 2013 during the morning (6:30-9:30 AM),
noon (11:00 AM-1:30 PM), and evening hours (3:00-6:30 PM). Certified traffic (dated March 4, 2014)
was provided for the intersection as part of the future resurfacing project. Count data and design year
traffic volume forecasts are provided in Appendix B. The certified traffic was 20-30% higher than the
actual count data. The existing count data was used in the capacity analysis.

Note that NOACA was contacted to obtain a growth rate to use for design year analysis. The NOACA
model reports a decline in traffic in the project area.

    CRASH ANALYSIS
CRASH DATA
Crash data was provided by ODOT for the study intersection. The crash data represents a three-year study
period from 2010 to 2012. Each documented report has been reviewed to confirm the accuracy and
location of all crashes within the study limits. Crash diagrams are provided in Appendix C.

HIGHWAY SAFETY MANUAL
The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) provides tools to conduct quantitative safety analyses with the
primary goal of predicting crash frequency and severity as a function of alternative roadway and
intersection designs. Prior to publication of the HSM in 2010, there was no industry-accepted resource
available to quantify future safety performance of a transportation facility. The HSM fills this need by
providing a science-based technical approach to safety analysis to predict "expected average crash
frequency" ­ the long-term average crash frequency of a site.

A primary reason for incorporating techniques of the Highway Safety Manual into the crash analysis
process is to overcome the short-term year-to-year variability in observed crash frequencies and the
effects of "regression to the mean" bias. Regression-to-the-mean (RTM) includes the natural variation in
crash data. Crash occurrences at a given site are random events that tend to fluctuate up and down over
the course of time. Year-to-year variability in crash frequencies as shown in Figure 5 adversely affects
crash estimation based on crash data collected over short periods (i.e. 3 years as is customary). The
randomness of crash occurrences indicates that short-term crash frequencies alone are not a reliable
estimator of long-term crash frequency.

Crash fluctuations over time make it difficult to determine whether changes in the observed crash
frequency are due to changes in site conditions or are due to natural fluctuations. When a period of high
crash frequency is observed, it is statistically probable that the following period will have a comparatively
low crash frequency. Similarly, there is a high probability that a low crash frequency period will be
followed by a high crash frequency period. This tendency is known as regression-to-the-mean (RTM).
Failure to account for the effects of RTM introduces the potential for "RTM bias" or "selection bias".
This occurs when sites are selected for treatment based on short-term trends in observed crash frequency.
RTM bias can also result in over or under estimation of effectiveness of a treatment (change in average
crash frequency) ­ without accounting for RTM bias, it is not possible to know if an observed reduction
in crashes is due to the treatment or if it would have occurred without the modification.

Figure 6 shows the effect of RTM and RTM bias. In this example, a site is selected for treatment based
on its short term crash frequency trend over three years (during upward trend). Due to RTM, it is probable
that the observed crash frequency will decrease toward the expected average crash frequency without any
treatment. A treatment is applied which results in a reduction of crashes and becomes the "perceived
effectiveness of treatment". However, some of this reduction would have occurred regardless of the
treatment (due to RTM), rendering the perceived effectiveness of the treatment to be greater than its
actual effectiveness.

FIGURE 6: REGRESSION TO THE MEAN




The predictive method described in Part C of the Highway Safety Manual provides steps to estimate the
expected average crash frequency of a site for a given time period, geometric design, traffic control
features, and traffic volumes. The expected average crash frequency (Nexpected) is estimated using a
predictive model estimate of crash frequency for a specific site type (Npredicted) together with observed
crash frequency (where available), as described in the following sections. The predictive method is
applicable for the following facility types: Rural Two-Lane Two-Way Roads, Rural Multilane Highways,
and Urban/Suburban Arterials.

PREDICTED CRASH FREQUENCY
Predicted model estimate of crash frequency (Equation 1): This step involves determination of the
predicted crash frequency which reflects how a site would be expected to perform relative to 1,000
similar sites. Calculation of predicted crash frequency utilizes Safety Performance Functions (SPF) for a
base condition. Crash Modification Factors (CMF) are then applied to account for specific site
characteristics that differ from the base condition. A state-level calibration factor is then applied to
normalize the base condition to localized conditions. The resulting value is the Predicted Crash Frequency
(Npredicted)
                                                                                  Equation 1


EXPECTED CRASH FREQUENCY
Expected average crash frequency (Equations 2 and 3): The next step involves calculation of the
expected average crash frequency which reflects average performance of the site over an extended period
of time based on actual crash history. This step incorporates the Empirical Bayes (EB) method which
combines actual (observed) crash history of the study site with predicted average crash frequency. These
values are weighted based on an over-dispersion parameter (k) that is the measure of the strength of the
model (safety performance factors). The resulting value is the expected average crash frequency (Nexpected)

OBSERVED CRASH HISTORY
Figure 7 shows the frequency of crashes have decreased between 2010 and 2012. The number of injury
crashes has remained constant (10 crashes per year) over the period evaluated. There were 6 crashes that
were reported as hit and run crashes ­ this crash type limits the ability to determine contributing factors
for these crashes. There were more crashes that occurred on Saturday than any other day of the week as
shown in Figure 8. The Saturday crashes occurred in the same time of day distribution as the other day of
the week crashes. Increased parking utilization on a Saturday may contribute to an increase of crashes on
the weekend.

FIGURE 9: FREQUENCY OF CRASHES BY CRASH TYPE




The following sections address each of the high frequency crash patterns identified on the corridor.

REAR END CRASHES
Rear end crashes, while present on all approaches, are concentrated on the northbound and southbound
approaches (27 of the total 40 rear end crashes). Review of crashes by hour of day indicates that the
crashes, and specifically rear end crashes, coincide with the 3 p.m. (school peak) and 5 p.m. (commuter
peak) periods (See Figure 10). These two peak hours represented 12 of the 40 total rear end crashes.

Congestion is often a contributing factor to rear end crashes. Field crews collecting field data did not
observe multi-cycle backups on any of the approaches at the signalized intersection. Individual
movements experience levels of service D or better. The capacity analysis section in Appendix E
contains the detailed analyses. The lane configuration on Lorain Avenue contributes to the rear-end crash
frequency ­ left turning vehicles stop in a shared through-left turn lane to complete their maneuver.

FIGURE 10: FREQUENCY OF CRASHES BY TIME OF DAY




LEFT TURN CRASHES
The highest number of left turn crashes is on the eastbound approach, which can be attributed in part to
the higher volume of left turns at this approach, as well as to the lack of a left turn lane. The opposing left
turn movements on Lorain Avenue are offset due to the lane configuration (4-lane section). The offset
left turn movements restrict visibility of vehicles in the adjacent through lanes.

SIDESWIPE-PASSING CRASHES
About half (5 crashes) of the sideswipe-passing crashes occurred in the southbound approach of West
117th Street. A contributing factor for sideswipe crashes would be due to congestion on the approaches.

BICYCLE CRASHES
One bicycle crash was reported on West 117th Street. This crash occurred when a northbound motorist
was making a right turn onto Lorain Avenue and failed to yield to a bicyclist crossing the intersection.

    COUNTERMEASURES
SHORT-TERM COUNTERMEASURES

Signal Timing Modifications
Two countermeasures are proposed to mitigate all crash types within the study area:
    >   The all red clearance time for the eastbound and southbound lead phases is currently 1 second.
        An increase of the all red clearance time for the eastbound and southbound lead left turn phases is
        recommended based on ODOT Traffic Engineering Manual and ITE guidelines and as
        summarized in Appendix D. This countermeasure mitigates the eastbound and southbound left
        turn crashes.
    >   Evaluate Saturday signal timing plans to confirm that cycle lengths and splits match traffic
        demands. Delays during the weekend time periods may contribute to increased crash frequency,
        especially on a Saturday.

Traffic control improvements
Several improvements are proposed to mitigate rear end and sideswipe passing crashes within the study
area:
    >   The stop line to signal head distances on the southbound and the westbound approaches exceed
        120 feet. Trees along Lorain Avenue restrict visibility of signal heads if aligned near the edge of
        pavement and access points within the functional area on W. 117th Street also compete for driver
        attention. Add a near side signal head to the back side of the existing mast arm to increase
        visibility of the signal installation ­ use a 5-section signal head on approaches with protected/
        permissive left turn phases.
    >   Extend the southbound left turn lane 50 feet to maximize storage for the Lorain Avenue/ W. 117th
        Street intersection.
    >   Add route marker signs to the existing overhead sign supports on the W. 117th Street approaches.
        The route markers provide advance guidance for State Route 10.


Lorain Avenue Left Turn Lane
It is recommended to install a left turn lane on the Lorain Avenue eastbound and westbound approaches
of the intersection. As discussed in the HSM, "by removing left-turning vehicles from the traffic stream,
conflicts with through vehicles can be reduced or even eliminated depending on the signal timing and
phasing scheme. Providing a left-turn lane allows drivers to wait in the turn lane until a gap in the
opposing traffic allows them to turn safely."

Installation of left turn lane on the eastbound and westbound approaches would have a range of safety
benefits, as indicated in HSM. The installation of left turn lanes directly opposite each other would
improve the sight distance for left-turning motorists. Because the left turn lanes currently have a negative
offset, a vehicle waiting in the left turn lane for one approach hinders the sight distance for the opposing
left-turning motorist. As further indicated in HSM, the installation of a left turn lane has the potential to
reduce the frequency of all crash types, and not just left turn crashes. The presence of an exclusive left
turn lane reduces the potential for sudden lane changes thus reducing the number of rear-end and
sideswipe crashes.

Two alternatives may be considered for implementing this short term countermeasure.

    >   Alternative 1: 3-lane section. The eastbound and westbound approaches are restriped to
        provide a left-turn lane and through/right-turn lane on each approach, as well as one receiving
        lane. This alternative would require shifting the roadway centerline for a distance of 245 feet in
        advance of the intersection. Alternative 1 would maintain on-street parking. Delays with this
        alternative (29.1 seconds per vehicle delay/ LOS C) are expected to be comparable to existing
        conditions (29.2 seconds per vehicle delay/ LOS C). This section could also accommodate bike
        lanes within the existing pavement widths.

    >   Alternative 1A: 3 lane section + WB right turn lane. This alternative (27.4 seconds per
        vehicle delay/ LOS C) reduces the vehicle delays when compared to the existing condition.
        Parking on the north side of Lorain Avenue (east leg) is already prohibited (120 feet from the
        intersection) to accommodate the existing bus stop. The bus shelter can be moved towards the
        end of the right turn lane (150 ft. minimum) to accommodate an eastbound right turn overlap.
        Alternative 1A would maintain on-street parking except for one additional space.

        An eastbound right turn lane can also be accommodated due to the presence of a bus shelter on
        the southwest quadrant of the intersection. This improvement provides for a de facto bus turnout
        to improve intersection capacity.

This improvement is to include the installation of overhead sign supports for lane use and route markers
(TO I-90). The advance, overhead signs communicate to motorists a change of lane configuration on the
Lorain Avenue approaches.


LONG-TERM COUNTERMEASURES

Alternative 2: 5-lane section. This alternative proposes a left-turn lane, through lane, and through/right-
turn lane on the eastbound and westbound approaches. This configuration increases capacity but would
require the removal of on-street parking on Lorain Avenue between Bosworth Road and W. 120th Street.
Parking could be permitted during off peak period periods. Bus stops would encroach on the right-most
travel lane.

The HSM indicates that a countermeasure for the installation of a left turn lane is associated with a CMF
(Crash Modification Factor) of .58 for all crash types and crash severity. The removal of on-street
parking often has the effect of reducing the number of crashes, but HSM provides a CMF for the removal
of on-street parking only for roadway segments, not for the functional areas of intersections. A CMF for
removing on-street parking proximate to the intersection, proposed in Alternative 2, would thus not be
applicable.


OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

Restrict Parking
Vehicles parked immediately adjacent to the intersection on the eastbound receiving leg can cause
conflict between turning vehicles and through vehicles at the intersection. Removing the parking for a
minimum of 50 feet (the equivalent of 2 spaces) will improve visibility at the intersection as well as
remove the potential conflict between parked vehicles and moving vehicles in the immediate intersection
area. This strategy may have an impact on the eastbound crashes.

    COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
CALCULATION OF BENEFIT TO COST RATIO
An economic appraisal was performed to determine whether the benefits of the proposed
countermeasure for the intersection would outweigh costs, and to identify which of the two
alternatives would be most cost-effective. The economic appraisal is an important component of
ODOT safety studies; by targeting the most cost-effective safety strategies for projects, ODOT can
achieve greater reductions in injuries and property damage for the same financial investment.

This appraisal employed ECAT (ODOT's Economic Crash Analysis Tool), discussed in the steps
below.

1. Identify changes in crash frequency
ECAT was used to calculate the projected change in crash frequency following installation of the left
turn lane for the two main build alternatives: Alternative 1 and Alternative 2. As discussed in the
countermeasures section. Table 2 summarizes crash frequency under the proposed conditions.

Conditions


As indicated, the installation of the left turn lane is anticipated to reduce the number of crashes at this
intersection by about 5.1 crashes per year compared to the Expected Conditions scenario.

2. Identify service life and cost of the proposed countermeasure.
There are two components of the proposed countermeasure: installing new roadway striping, and
adjusting the existing signal displays for eastbound and westbound traffic in order to center these
displays over the restriped lanes. Since the service life of turn lanes is typically characterized as 20
years, the cost was prepared assuming restriping as necessary to provide a 20 year lifespan. As
documented in Appendix F, the cost of Alternative 1 is estimated to be $67,280, and the cost of
Alternative 2 is estimated to be $94,232. The striping installation and restriping accounts for the
large majority of the countermeasure cost, with the adjustment of the signal display estimated to cost
approximately $2,000 under both build alternatives.

It should be noted that ODOT has programmed a resurfacing project on Lorain Avenue in the study
area. The restriping should be scheduled to coordinate with that project. The project, PID 84289, is
currently in Design, with an estimated construction date of September 30, 2017. Because the
resurfacing project is already programmed, this cost was not included in the countermeasure cost
estimate.

3. Determine annual monetary value of crash reduction, net present value of safety benefits,
and benefit to cost ratio. The estimated reduction in crash frequency is converted to a monetary

value, by using the "comprehensive societal crash costs" for each crash type provided by ODOT. The
cost of each crash by severity is shown in Table 3.

TABLE 3: CRASH COST BY SEVERITY
                Crash Severity                        Crash Cost

     Fatal & Incapacitating Injury Crash               $315,543
      Non-Incapacitating Injury Crash                   $54,470
           Possible Injury Crash                        $36,920
          Property Damage Crash                         $8,320

The crash cost is multiplied by the annual reduction in crash frequency to calculate the annual value
of the safety countermeasures, and a discount factor of 4% is applied to the annual value for the
service life of the countermeasures in order to determine the NPV (net present value). Finally, the
NPV is compared to the cost of the improvement in order to determine the benefit to cost ratio.

Using these criteria, Table 4 compares the two main build alternatives under consideration for the
intersection. As indicated in the table, the benefit to cost ratio of Alternative 1 is 29.21, and the
benefit to cost ratio of Alternative 2 is 20.85. Since both countermeasures have the same safety
benefit, but Alternative 2 costs more than Alternative 1, the benefit to cost ratio is superior for
Alternative 1. As a variation of Alternative 1, Alternative 1A (adding a westbound right turn
lane to a standard 3-lane section) increases the operational benefits of Alternative 1 without
adding additional costs.

Subject: RE: District 12 growth rate request

Hello Scott

Enclosed please find the growth rates based on the Regional Model inputs for the requested locations.
Please note that the rates are for the 2012 to 2035 projects. The model is showing traffic decrease on all intersections except the
SR-306 / SR-84 intersection in Lake County.
In general when the forecast traffic is less than existing traffic you can do the analysis based on existing year 2012 traffic.
If you need a copy of the raw model numbers please let me know.
Let me know if you need additional information. Sorry for the delay and HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

Mahmound

LJB is working with District 12 on several safety study locations. Attached is current traffic data for these locations.
                                                   th
1. CUY-10-10.14 (Lorain Road (SR 10) at W. 150 Street)

2. CUY-10-11.94 (Lorain Road (SR 10) at W. 117 Street)
3. CUY-17-11.57 (Brookpark Road (SR 17) at Broadview Road (SR 176))
                                                               3
4. CUY-422-4.34 (Kinsman Road (US 422) at E. 93rd Street)
5. LAK-84-8.14 (Johnnycake Ridge Road (SR 84) at Broadmoor Road (SR 306))

Typically planning level growth rates are sufficient for use on a safety study. I am interested in a 20 year horizon.

Please advise when you are able to generate these numbers?

Thank you

CLEARANCE INTERVAL

    CLEARANCE CALCULATIONS
The National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 731: Guidelines for Timing
Yellow and All-Red Intervals at Signalized Intersections was published in July 2012. A number of
conclusions were reached as a result of the comprehensive study that is important to the safety
performance of signalized intersections.
      The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Proposed Recommended Practice for the
      calculation of yellow change intervals and all-red clearance intervals is the methodology used by
      the highest percentage of state and local agencies.
      Drivers were documented to decelerate when turning at an intersection. The NCHRP Report 731
      recommended using a design speed of 20 miles per hour for the calculation of all red timing.
      Research conducted by the North Carolina Department of Transportation published by the ITE
      Journal determined that the average operating speed for left turning traffic is 17 miles per hour.
      Using the current ITE guidelines to calculate the duration of yellow change and red clearance
      intervals has been shown to reduce total crashes between 8 and 14 percent while reducing injury
      crashes by approximately 12 percent.
      Using the current ITE guidelines to calculate the duration of yellow change and red clearance
      intervals has been shown to reduce red light running occurrences between 36 and 50 percent.
Vehicle clearance times were calculated for the W. 117th Street/Loraine Avenue intersection based on
guidelines published in the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the ITE Proposed
Recommended Practice. For the purposes of the clearance calculations, the posted speed limits were
utilized, 25 mph on Lorain Avenue and 35 mph on W. 117th Street, for the through phases. For the
protected left turn phases, 25 mph was used for all approaches.
The calculated clearance times, as well as existing times, are summarized in Table A. Calculations are
included as well.

Note: The maximum threshold all-red clearance time is 3 seconds. Calculated values may be longer than 3 seconds.

Increasing the all red interval to 2 seconds for both for Phase 5 and Phase 7 is recommended based on the
calculated clearance times.

    CAPACITY ANALYSIS
Traffic operations were analyzed using Synchro Version 8 (results were output to HCM 2010
methodology) to assess the traffic performance and operational efficiency of the intersection of West
117th Street and Lorain Avenue (CUY-10). The analysis results include the approach delay (measured in
seconds of delay), volume-capacity (v/c) ratio, and level of service (LOS) for each approach as well as the
overall intersection. Average delay is an indication of the expected delay that would typically be
experienced in the lane, on the approach, or at the intersection. A v/c ratio that is less than 1.0 indicates
that the lane is operating below capacity. A v/c ratio of 1.0 indicates that the lane is operating at capacity
and a v/c greater than 1.0 indicates over-capacity conditions. Level of service (LOS) is a grading scale
based upon average delay, with LOS A representing free-flow conditions, LOS E E representing
operational capacity and LOS F representing over-capacity. The specific delay thresholds for assessing
intersection performance are provided by the Transportation Research Board in the Highway Capacity
Manual, as shown in Table A.

Traffic signal operation was evaluated at the West 117th Street and Lorain Avenue intersection using the
existing signal timing with the 2013 Existing Year traffic volumes for the AM and PM peak hours. The
intersection is coordinated with proximate signalized intersections along West 117th Street, so the existing
cycle was maintained for the future year analysis. Based upon the clearance calculation results, it is
recommended to increase the all red clearance time for all phases to 2 seconds.

The volume distribution on the eastbound approach causes the through-left turn lane to function as a
defacto left turn lane for HCS analysis purposes. The existing condition analysis assumed the eastbound
configuration as left turn lane and shared through-right turn lane. The results of the capacity analysis are
shown in Tables B and C. The detailed reports are also included.

 *EBLT was analyzed as a dedicated left turn lane, per HCM requirement for defacto left turn lane.
 Capacity analysis was conducted using Synchro 8. Results were exported to HCS 2010 methodology.


The intersection currently operates at LOS D or better on all movements and approaches, during both the
AM and PM peak hour. Alternative 1 will increase the overall delay and the delay on each of the
approaches and operates at LOS E or better on all approaches and movements. The LOS E on the
northbound approach could be improved with the addition of a protected phase for the northbound left turn
movement. On the westbound approach, the capacity is constrained for the through and right turning
traffic, as those movements are higher than the eastbound approach. Alternative 1A adds a westbound right
turn lane, which will allow the right turn movement to operate with an overlap with the southbound left turn
protected phase. Parking as is currently permitted is generally maintained for both Alternative 1 and 1A.

Alternative 2 constructs an additional through lane on both eastbound and westbound approaches. There is
a slight decrease in delay, but overall Alternative 2 operates very similar to Alternative 1A, except parking
would need to be removed for Alternative 2.

 STORAGE AND QUEUE
LENGTH CALCULATIONS
    STORAGE LANE LENGTHS
Turn lane storage lengths were calculated using guidelines specified in the Location and Design Manual
Section 401 (Ohio Department of Transportation). Lane lengths based on ODOT standard criteria assume
posted speed limit and include both vehicle storage and a 50 foot diverging taper. The ODOT
methodology considers both the storage needed for the left turning traffic and the through queue
blockage. A summary of the storage length calculation results and existing lengths are shown in Table A
with calculations appended to this section.
Turn lane lengths were calculated using the following parameters:
     Higher of the AM or PM peak hour traffic volume for the 2016 year (certified traffic).
     35 mph posted speed on W. 117th Street.
     25 mph posted speed on Lorain Avenue.
     Lengths presented in Table A, based on ODOT methodology, include vehicle storage,
     deceleration, and 50-foot diverging taper.

TURN

As shown in Table A, the existing northbound left turn storage lane length is sufficient under the
minimum criteria, it is deficient based on the preferred storage length though. The southbound left turn
lane storage lane length is deficient by 110 feet (115 ft provided vs. 225 ft. minimum). The left turn lane
on both of these approaches is developed from a two-way-left-turn-lane (TWLTL), which can provide
overflow storage for the turn lane. The calculation is based on a design hour condition, for other times of
the day when the demand is not as heavy, the left turn vehicles are not likely to need the full minimum
storage and the TWLTL will accommodate access to the business driveways and cross-streets within the
influence area.

The required storage lane length was also calculated for Alternatives 1 and 2, as proposed. Alternative 1
converts the eastbound and westbound Lorain Avenue cross-sections into one lane in each direction with
a center turn lane at the intersection (potentially a TWLTL continued through the area). Alternative 2
adds a left turn lane on Lorain Avenue eastbound and westbound, but maintains the existing two through
lanes. Table A also includes the resulting turn lane lengths required for the eastbound and westbound
approaches.

  APPENDIX H
 SAFETY FUNDING
 GUIDELINES AND
APPLICATION FORM
                             Safety Funding Application

When: The safety funding application is due to Central Office annually by April 30 and
September 30 of each year. Local sponsors should coordinate applications with their
local district office at least six weeks in advance of this deadline. Every application
and supporting documentation must be reviewed and approved by the district prior to
submission to Central Office. This application and supporting documentation will be
used by the Safety Program Committee to set the safety program priorities.



What is needed in the Safety Application: The safety funding application is
submitted for projects that are listed on the ODOT District Office Safety Annual Work
Plan or on priority lists developed by local governments. Projects which have fewer
than ten crashes in the most recent three-year period and an annual crash rate less
than 1.0 crashes / MVM are typically not eligible. Projects which cost less than $50,000
are also not typically eligible. The following items should be included in the safety
application:

       1. Brief Project Description ­ Including CO-RT-SEC, District, PID if assigned
       2. Summary of Problem Statement
       3. Summary of Recommended Countermeasures
       4. Project Priority (Rank, LPA priority)
       5. Project Development Status
       6. Crash data points
       7. Copy of the Safety Engineering Study
       8. Traffic Volume Data
       9. Project Location Map
       10. Photographs of the Project Site
       11. Economic Analysis
       12. Estimated Cost by phase and funding source
       13. Affirmative signatures from a majority of the DSRT members
       14. Name of a contact person
       15. Project sponsoring agency
       16. Project schedule

What the application is used for: The Safety Program Committee evaluates the
applications and project scoring to establish and publish an annual listing of approved
safety projects for funding from the Safety Program. The program committee reviews
all documentation to insure the countermeasures address the safety problem and are a



September 26, 2008
statewide priority. The project scoring emphasizes projects with a high frequency
and/or severity of crashes.



Problems with Safety Applications:

       1. Problems with submissions having the most current crash data
       2. Problems with the photographs submitted not being clear enough
       3. Project Cost Estimates changing drastically through the project development
       4. Schedules changing dramatically through project development
       5. Not enough reservoir committed for the safety program
       6. Coordination of scope changes are not being reported/approved by the safety
          program committee/program manager
       7. The District holding Project scoping meetings to review project history,
          schedule, and plan of action. The District needs to involve the appropriate
          District staff, safety program manager, and Central Office personnel (Office of
          Environmental Services, Office of Real Estate, Consultant Services, Office of
          Roadway Services, etc.) and conduct the meeting.
       8. Microsoft project schedules on all safety projects are not being developed or
          kept up to date.

PROJECT COST UPDATES

The District shall review project costs and keep them up to date. At a minimum, the
project costs shall be reviewed, revised, and entered in Ellis at the project initiation
phase, the time a preferred alternative is selected, and at the completion of Stage 3
plans. The Safety Program Manager must be kept apprised of any cost changes.
These changes could require safety program committee approval if they exceed 10%.

The Office of Estimating will notify the Safety Program Manager of the approximate
Safety funding estimated to be utilized on each Safety project after the official
engineer's estimate has been prepared. The Safety Program Manager will insure that
the Safety funding estimate is within the safety commitment as outlined on the safety
funding list.

Change Orders

            ·   The Scope of Services shall be provided to the Construction Project
                Engineer on all safety projects.




September 26, 2008
           ·   The District Planning Administrator shall review the Scope of Services with
               the Construction Project Engineer in order to provide him/her a clear
               understanding of the intent of the project and which items of work are
               related to the Safety program.

           ·   When processing an extra work change order, the Construction Project
               Engineer shall evaluate the extra work along with the Scope of Services to
               determine if the work is necessary to satisfy the intent of the safety portion
               of the project. The District Planning and Program Administrator will
               coordinate with the safety program manager to determine if additional
               studies or analysis are requires prior to acceptance of the change order.
               After the Construction Project Engineer and District Planning and
               Programming Administrator have determined that the extra work change
               order should be funded by the Safety Program Manager, the request is
               made to the safety program manager. The request shall include a
               description of the work involved and a justification for the requested
               change order.

           ·   Any change order in the amount greater than $50,000 and all change
               orders after the project price has increased 10% must be approved by the
               safety program manager.

           ·   If a change order is deemed an emergency and the change order work
               must advance without approval of the safety program manager, the safety
               funding will be contingent on the justification and proceeding approval of
               the safety program manager. Any change order submitted for work
               advanced without safety approval will be funded from District allocation or
               other sources if safety funding is subsequently determined to be
               unjustified.

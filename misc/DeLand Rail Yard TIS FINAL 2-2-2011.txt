EXISTING ROADWAY ANALYSIS
Weekday, a.m. and p.m. peak-period turning movement counts were conducted at each of the study area
intersections (with the exception of SR 44 at US 17/92, where only through movements were quantified due to the
absence of turns at this location). Figure 2 graphically shows the existing a.m. and p.m. peak-hour turning
movements at the study area intersections. The counts are provided in Appendix C, along with synopsis counts
along study segments of SR 44.

Unsignalized Intersection Analysis
The level of service (LOS) at an unsignalized intersection is based on the average stop delay per vehicle for the
various movements within the intersection. The operating conditions at the unsignalized intersection were
analyzed using the Highway Capacity Software Version 5.3 (HCS+). HCS+ utilizes the procedures outlined in
Chapter 17 of the Highway Capacity Manual, titled "Unsignalized Intersections." Table 1 shows the existing a.m.
and p.m. peak-hour levels of service (LOS). As indicated in Table 1, the intersection does not currently operate
within the adopted level of service during the p.m. peak-hour. The HCS+ printouts are included in Appendix D.
It should be noted that side-street volumes at this location do not meet eighth highest hour warranting criteria for
signal control and, therefore, a signal does not appear to be warranted under existing conditions.

Signalized Intersection Analysis
The LOS at a signalized intersection is based on the average control delay per vehicle for the various movements
within the intersection. The operating conditions at the signalized intersections were evaluated using HCS+. This
software utilizes the methodology outlined in Chapter 16 of the Highway Capacity Manual, titled "Signalized
Intersections".

It should be noted that the segment of SR 15A adjacent to its intersection with SR 44 has recently been
designated as an FDOT Strategic Intermodal System (SIS) facility. Therefore, the adopted level of service for the
SR 15A approaches to this intersection are LOS "C", while the adopted LOS for the eastbound and westbound
approaches (of SR 44) are LOS "D". For this reason, the operational delay and corresponding LOS for this
intersection have been identified by approach in Table 2. As indicated in Table 2, each approach of this
intersection operates within its respective adopted level of service. The SR 44 at US 17/92 intersection also
currently operates within the adopted service levels. These HCS+ analyses were conducted using signal timings
provided by the County. The HCS+ printouts are included in Appendix E.

Roadway Segment Analysis
Roadway level of service describes the operating condition determined from the number of vehicles passing over
a given section of roadway during a specified time period. It is a qualitative measure of several factors which
include speed, travel time, traffic interruptions, freedom to maneuver, driver comfort, convenience, safety and
vehicle operating costs. Six LOS have been established as standards by which to gauge roadway performance,
designated by the letters A through F. The LOS categories are defined as follows:

        Level of Service A:     Free flow, individual users virtually unaffected by the presence of others
        Level of Service B:     Stable flow with a high degree of freedom to select operating conditions
        Level of Service C:     Flow remains stable, but with significant interactions with others
        Level of Service D:     High-density stable flow in which the freedom to maneuver is severely restricted
        Level of Service E:     This condition represents the capacity level of the road
        Level of Service F:     Forced flow in which the traffic exceeds the amount that can be served

Concurrency and AADT road segment volumes will be obtained from the most recently available roadway Volusia
County segment counts (currently dated 2009). As indicated in Table 3, all roadway segments currently operate
within the adopted service levels. The procedures documented in the latest version of the Florida Department of
Transportation (FDOT) Quality Level of Service Handbook were used to determine specific capacity.

A.M. peak-hour directional roadway segment analysis has been requested by the County for certain segments of
SR 44, due to congestion concerns with respect to eastbound a.m. peak-hour traffic. A.M. peak-hour directional
road segment volumes for these segments were obtained from the FDOT 2008 Florida Traffic Information
synopsis counts. The resultant segment analyses are shown in Table 4. As indicated in Table 4, each of these
segments operates within the peak-hour directional adopted service levels during the a.m. peak-hour.

FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The next step in the analysis was to determine the future traffic conditions on the study area roadways at the time
of project completion. The following documents the procedures used to determine the future traffic.

Background Traffic
Traffic on the roadway network will continue to grow due to local development approvals. FDOT Traffic Trends
software was used to calculate the average annual historical growth rates for the area roadway segments, using
the past five years of available historical AADT data obtained from FDOT (2004-2008). The result of the trend
analysis is shown in Table 5 below (see Appendix F for Trends print-outs). As is consistent with Volusia County
TIA guidelines, growth rates of at least two percent will be applied to each segment, unless one percent can be
documented.

TRIP GENERATION
                           th
The ITE Trip Generation, 8 Edition does not contain an aggregate transfer facility, such as the proposed
development. Therefore, engineering judgment was used to estimate trips based on information provided by the
owner of the facility (see owner-provided memo included in Appendix G). The development is expected to have 5
employees and a maximum of 275 trucks daily, plus regular mail services. Table 6 shows the total daily, am.
peak-hour, and p.m. peak-hour trip generation under the proposed rezoning. This trip generation represents the
most intense use of the requested rezoning for this property.

Trip Distribution
The process of determining the directional flow of traffic associated with a new development is called trip
distribution. Due to the nature of the proposed development, project trips will be distributed as follows to the
regional roadway based on an estimation of anticipated truck activity, which has been based on information
provided by the owner of the facility (Appendix G) and knowledge of the study area: The project trip distribution is
graphically illustrated in Figure 3.

    ·   25% to and from the north via SR 15A
    ·   40 % to and from the west via SR 44
    ·   22 % to and from the east via SR 44
    ·   13% to and from the south via US 17 and SR 15A

Trip Assignment
The final step in the analysis was to assign the project traffic to the road network. Figure 4 graphically depicts the
a.m. and p.m. peak-hour project trip assignment.

FUTURE ROADWAY ANALYSIS
The critical intersections and road segments were analyzed based on the existing roadway conditions to
determine potential impacts and to investigate mitigation requirements. It should be noted that heavy vehicle
percentages were updated to reflect the addition of heavy vehicles to the study area intersections due to the
proposed development.

Unsignalized Intersection Analysis
The unsignalized intersections were analyzed to determine the operational LOS at the time of build-out. Table 9
shows the build-out a.m. and p.m. peak-hour levels of service. As indicated in the table, the unsignalized site
drive is expected to operate acceptably. However, the SR 44/Grand Avenue intersection is not expected to
operate within the adopted LOS under 2011 build-out conditions. The HCS+ printouts for the unsignalized
locations are included in Appendix H.

The failure of an unsignalized intersection does not automatically mean that volumes will meet warrant thresholds
for signal control. This appears to be the case at SR 44/Grand Avenue where side-street volumes are low and
the major street approaches both operate at a LOS "A" (see HCS+ print-outs). Additionally, a preliminary
evaluation of 2011 build-out volumes against signal warrant criteria indicates that side-street volumes do not meet
eighth highest hour warranting thresholds for signal control. It should be noted that, in a December 2001 SR 44
PD&E Study (From CR 42 to West Ramps of I-4), prepared by GMB Engineers & Planners, Inc on behalf of
Volusia County, signalization of this intersection by the year 2005 was recommended. Therefore, a signal warrant
study is recommended to determine whether volumes at this intersection will meet signal warrant thresholds in the
future.

Signalized Intersection Analysis
The signalized intersections were analyzed to determine the operational LOS at the time of build-out. Table 10
shows the projected LOS for these intersections. As indicted in Table 10 both of the signalized intersections are
expected to operate acceptably under 2011 build-out conditions during the a.m. and p.m. peak-hour. The HCS+
summary sheets are contained in Appendix I.

Roadway Segment Analysis
The traffic analysis for the roadway segments involves the comparison of the future peak-hour two-way volumes
to available capacity. Table 11 presents the results of the peak-hour two-way road segment analysis for the study
area roadways under 2011 build-out conditions. As indicated in Table 11, all roadway segments will operate
within the adopted service levels

In the December 2001 SR 44 PD&E Study (From CR 42 to West Ramps of I-4), prepared by GMB Engineers &
Planners, Inc, certain improvements were recommended to improve deficient conditions along segments of SR
44. Among these recommendations was the installation of a bi-directional turn-lane on SR 44 between Amelia
Avenue and Blue Lake Avenue. The addition of a bi-directional turn-lane along this segment would increase the
default peak-hour two-way capacity of SR 44 to approximately 1,680 vehicles, with a corresponding peak-hour
directional capacity of approximately 924 vehicles. Because this segment of SR 44 is highly directional
(westbound during the a.m. peak-hours and eastbound during the p.m. peak-hours), this improvement would yield
adequate capacity to accommodate the projected future travel demands.

Also contained in the 2001 PD&E study was a recommendation to extend Beresford Avenue from its present
terminus at Blue Lake Avenue eastward to Summit Avenue as a two-lane roadway. A portion of this extension,
from Blue Lake Avenue to Kepler Road, is also included in the Volusia County Work Program, although not
currently funded. Such an extension of Beresford Avenue would alleviate congestion on SR 44 between Blue
Lake Avenue and Kepler Road by providing alternate, parallel, capacity.

The segments of SR 44 between the proposed development Site Drive and US 17/92 were also evaluated under
a.m. peak-hour directional build-out conditions, at the request of County Staff. As indicated in Table 12, these
segments will continue to operate within the adopted service levels during the a.m. peak-hour, with the addition of
project traffic.

Re: DeLand Rail Yard ­Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) and Rezoning Analysis Methodology (Version 4)

Dear Mr. Cheney:

Lassiter Transportation Group, Inc. (LTG) has prepared a TIA for DeLand Rail Yard on behalf of East Bay Group,
Inc., which was submitted to Volusia County (in the amount of five printed copies plus one electronic version) on
March 26, 2010. The development will be located along SR 44 east of the railroad tracks and west of Grand
Avenue in Volusia County (see Figure 1 for general location). Access to the proposed development will be
provided via one driveway on SR 44 (see attached conceptual site plan). Build-out of the development is
anticipated by the end of 2011. This methodology letter has been revised from the April 7, 2010 submittal to
include the trip generation calculations for the maximum existing versus proposed zoning categories.

REPORT FORMAT
Four printed copies and one electronic version of the TIA will be submitted to the County for review. The TIA will have
a title page which will include the development name, the developer's name, company, address and phone number,
the professional engineer's name, company, address and phone number and the TIA preparation date. A table of
contents will be provided which lists the figures, tables, chapters and appendices. A completed TIA Submission
Checklist, as provided by the County, will be submitted with the TIA report.

TRIP GENERATION
                              th
The ITE Trip Generation, 8 Edition was used to calculate the trip generation for the land uses allowed for each
zoning under the existing designations. The ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition does not contain an aggregate
transfer facility, such as the proposed development. Therefore, engineering judgment was used to estimate trips
based on information provided by the owner of the facility (see Exhibit 2 for owner-provided memo). The
development is expected to have 5 employees and a maximum of 275 trucks daily, plus regular mail services.
Table 1 shows the total daily, am. peak-hour and p.m. peak-hour trip generation possible under the existing
designations. The maximum total trip generation possible under the proposed designations are shown in Table 2.
Table 3 indicates the difference between the existing and proposed designations. As indicated in Table 3, the
existing designations generate a total of 2,330 more daily, 411 more a.m. peak-hour, and 534 more p.m. peak-
hour trips than does the proposed development.

IMPACTED ROADWAYS/INTERSECTIONS
The Volusia County Land Development Code requires that the study area consist of roadways within a five-mile
radius (which is also graphically illustrated in Figure 1) on which project traffic is at least one percent of the peak-
hour, two-way capacity (for a project of this size) as well as roadways which are above 90 percent of their
capacity.

Given the nature of the proposed development and the low trip generation relative to the p.m. peak-hour upon
which concurrency standards are based, County Staff has agreed to a review of a methodology which proposes
to study anticipated major truck routes. Distribution of project trips along these anticipated major truck routes has
been derived from information provided by the owner of the facility (see Exhibit 2) and general knowledge of the
study area.

The affected roadway segments are shown in Table 4 and graphically illustrated in Figure 1. Of these roadways,
no segments are expected to be impacted by project traffic to a level of greater that one percent of the adopted
peak-hour, two-way capacity. However, at the request of County staff, SR 44 from the Shell Road to Kepler Road
will be included for study due to significant assignment of project trips and critical and near-critical status along
certain portions of this road segment. The resultant proposed study area intersections and roadway segments
are as follows:

Intersections:
·   SR 44 at Site Drive (future conditions only)
·   SR 44 at Grand Avenue
·   SR 44 at SR 15A
·   SR 44 and US 17/92

Roadway Segments:
·   SR 44 from Shell Road to Kepler Road

ANALYSIS SCENARIOS
Existing Scenario
This includes the analysis of existing traffic on the existing network. The existing network includes all existing roads,
major roads under construction by a non-governmental party, plus all improvements for which construction contracts
have been executed by government agencies at the time the proposed transportation methodology statement is initially
submitted.

Future scenario
This includes the analysis of existing traffic, plus background traffic (derived from growth rates developed using
FDOT's Traffic Trends), plus project traffic assigned to the existing network, and all improvements funded for
construction within the first three years of the City of DeLand Five-Year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and
County's Five-Year Work Program. There are no programmed capacity-enhancing improvements affecting the
proposed study area.

GENERAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS AND SOFTWARE
Both a.m. and p.m. peak-hour intersection analysis will be conducted for this development.

Level of Service (LOS)
LOS will be analyzed for all site-access intersections and the major road segments and intersections included in the
network defined by the IMPACTED ROADWAYS/INTERSECTIONS Section.

Road Segment Analysis ­P.M. Peak-Hour Two-Way
Road segment volumes will be obtained from the most recently available roadway Volusia County segment
counts (currently dated 2008). If the peak-hour two-way traffic is expected to exceed the maximum service
volume of a roadway segment, a transportation analysis may be conducted to determine the service volume
specific to that segment. The procedures documented in the latest version of the Florida Department of
Transportation (FDOT) Quality Level of Service Handbook will be used to determine specific capacity.

Road Segment Analysis ­A.M. Peak-Hour Directional (SR 44 from Site Drive to US 17/92)
A.M. peak-hour directional roadway segment analysis has been requested by the County for certain segments of
SR 44, due to congestion concerns with respect to eastbound a.m. peak-hour traffic. A.M. peak-hour directional
road segment volumes for these segments will be obtained from synopsis counts available from FDOT Florida
Traffic Information Software (currently dated 2008).

The operating conditions at the unsignalized intersections will be analyzed using the Highway Capacity Software,
Version 5.3 (HCS+). HCS+ utilizes the procedures outlined in Chapter 17 of the Highway Capacity Manual, titled
"Unsignalized Intersections."
The operating conditions at the signalized intersections will be evaluated using the Highway Capacity Software
Version 5.3 (HCS+). This software utilizes the methodology outlined in Chapter 16 of the Highway Capacity
Manual, titled "Signalized Intersections". HCS+ analysis at signalized intersections will be based upon existing
Signal Timing Plans provided by Volusia County. For any future HCS+ analysis at a signalized intersection the
minimum green time will be 8 seconds; unless, otherwise approved by Volusia County Traffic Engineering.

It should be noted that the heavy vehicle factors used in the HCS+ analyses of future conditions will be
appropriately modified to reflect the addition of new truck traffic, due to the proposed development.

DISTRIBUTION & TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT
Trip Distribution
Due to the nature of the proposed development, project will be distributed to the regional roadway based on an
estimation of anticipated truck activity, which has been based on information provided by the owner of the facility
(see Exhibit 2) and knowledge of the study area:

    ·   25% to and from the north via SR 15A
    ·   40 % to and from the west via SR 44
    ·   22 % to and from the east via SR 44
    ·   13% to and from the south via US 17 and SR 15A

Trip Assignment
Using the total a.m. and p.m. peak-hour trip generation and the trip distribution pattern, traffic will be assigned to
the study area roadways and intersections.

TRAFFIC COUNTS
Intersection turning movement counts (TMC) will be conducted on a typical weekday (Tuesday, Wednesday or
Thursday) from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. All TMCs used in the TIA will be less than one
year old.

BACKGROUND TRAFFIC GROWTH/FUTURE TRAFFIC
The existing traffic counts will be increased by a growth factor determined using FDOT's Traffic Trends and the
last five years of historical count data. All applied growth rates will be at least two percent, unless a one percent
growth rate can be documented.

LOS STANDARDS
The LOS standards for all major road segments will be consistent with the letter standards per the City of DeLand
adopted Comprehensive Plan on non-SIS State Roads and the County's latest standard on County Thoroughfare
Roads per the adopted Comprehensive Plan (unless the City has adopted a higher LOS standard). The overall
intersection LOS standard is the same as the segment standard except where different segment LOS standards apply
to different legs of the intersection, in which case the overall intersection LOS standard will be the lowest crossing road
standards.

MITIGATION OF IMPACTS
Appropriate roadway and intersection mitigation plans will be identified to adequately address any level of service
issues due to project impacts. Site access needs will be addressed.

If you have any questions or comments, please give me a call at 386.257.2571.

Re:       Martin Marietta Aggregate Off-Loading Facility, Deland, Florida



This memo is to summarize what we discussed last week concerning the haul routes likely to be
used by trucks traveling to and from the proposed Deland rail car off-loading facility. I spoke
with Brad McDanal, the Deland project manager, and he advised that Martin Marietta made some
initial investigations in an effort to determine where their potential customers are located relative
to the site. However, no in-depth survey was completed. They concluded the following as the
result of their investigations;

      ·   It is expected that traffic leaving the site will be divided with 60% traveling east and
          40% west.
      ·   The westbound traffic (40%) is expected to serve three existing asphalt plants that are
          located in that direction, plus the western route provides a direct route to the
          communities that make up the growing NW Orlando area.
      ·   It is estimated that 60% of the total loads leaving the site are bound directly to
          construction sites (primarily major road construction projects).
      ·   The remaining 40% of the loads are apt to go to various asphalt and concrete suppliers in
          the region
      ·   It is further estimated that 60% of the loads destined for construction sites (36% of the
          total) are expected to travel to Interstate 4 with half going north and half south.
      ·   Trucks looking to travel north on I-4 are apt to use SR-44 through downtown Deland.
          This would include approximately 18% of the trips.

Brad also confirmed that the most trucks that they can handle each day are approximately 225.
This is the maximum number they can physically load and process each day. He went on to
advise that for them to exceed 225 / day, they must add additional loading equipment and scales
to the project plan.

The above estimates are based on Martin Marietta's experience with similar facilities. Let me
know if there is any other information that you need.

TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM
To:             Jon Cheney, PE

From:           R. Sans Lassiter, PE

Subject:        DeLand Rail Yard ­ Rezoning Analysis

Date:           May 20, 2010

Lassiter Transportation Group, Inc. (LTG) was retained by East Bay Group, Inc. to prepare a traffic analysis in
support of a zoning designation change. The proposed amendment will change the zoning designation of the
55.26 -acre property from A-1, A-2 and I-1 to Master Planned Unit Development (MPUD). The property is located
along SR 44 east of the railroad tracks and west of Grand Avenue in unincorporated Volusia County (see Figure 1
for the general location).

The methodology and procedures used in this analysis are consistent with the Volusia County guidelines for the
analysis of zoning changes. The following analysis assesses the transportation impacts of the difference between
the maximum trips generated by the proposed zoning and existing zoning designations. The Volusia County
Zoning Change transportation analysis submission checklist is attached as Exhibit 1.

PROGRAMMED ROAD IMPROVEMENTS
Intersection improvements at SR 44/Kepler Road are included in the Volusia County Metropolitan Planning
Organization (MPO) Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) as funded for construction in 2009/2010.
Additionally, an extension of Beresford Avenue from its present termination at Blue Lake Avenue to Kepler Road
is included in the Volusia County Road Program as an unfunded development. Note that neither of these
identified improvements are being used in the analysis of future conditions.

TRIP GENERATION FOR THE EXISTING ZONING
The property's existing zoning classification is A-1 (Prime Agriculture) for approximately 4.26 acres, which yields
no development, A-2 (Rural Agriculture) for approximately 22.7 acres, which would yield 4 single-family dwelling
units, and I-1 (Light Industrial) for the remaining 28.3 acres, which would yield 739.65 ksf of manufacturing land
use.

Table 1 presents the trips associated with the property under the existing zoning. These calculations indicate the
worst case scenario in terms of trip generation and accordingly has been used to assess the impacts of the
existing zoning in the analysis. Trip generation was determined using the trip generation rates published by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in the document Trip Generation, 8th Edition.

TRIP GENERATION FOR THE PROPOSED ZONING
As stated earlier, the proposed zoning is MPUD. The maximum development to be allowed under the proposed
zoning is the proposed aggregate transfer facility. The ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition does not contain an
aggregate transfer facility, such as the proposed development. Therefore, engineering judgment was used to
estimate trips based on information provided by the owner of the facility. The development is expected to have 5
employees and a maximum of 275 trucks daily, plus regular mail services. Table 2 shows the total daily and p.m.
peak-hour trip generation under the proposed rezoning.

CHANGE IN TRIP GENERATION BETWEEN PROPOSED AND EXISTING ZONING
Table 3 compares the difference in trips between maximum development under the existing zoning designation
and the proposed zoning designation. As indicated in the table, under the maximum development scenario, the
existing zoning would generate 2,330 more daily and 534 more p.m. peak-hour trips than does the proposed
zoning designation.

PROJECT TRIP DISTRIBUTION
The process of determining the directional flow of traffic associated with a new development is called trip
distribution. Due to the nature of the proposed development, project trips will be distributed as follows to the
regional roadway based on an estimation of anticipated truck activity, which has been based on information
provided by the owner of the facility (see Exhibit 2) and knowledge of the study area: The project trip distribution
is graphically illustrated in Figure 1.

        25% to and from the north via SR 15A
        40 % to and from the west via SR 44
        22 % to and from the east via SR 44
        13% to and from the south via US 17 and SR 15A

STUDY AREA
A methodology letter (Exhibit 3) was submitted to Volusia County to determine the project study area.
Additionally, the Tier 1 Worksheet provided by the County was used to determine significance, see Exhibit 4. The
resultant agreed upon roadway segments to be included in the study are listed below:

    SR 44 from Shell Road to Site Drive                             SR 44 from Stone Street to Clara Avenue
    SR 44 from Site Drive to Grand Avenue                           SR 44 from Clara Avenue to Amelia Avenue
    SR 44 from Grand Avenue to Old New York Road                    SR 44 from Amelia Avenue to Hill Avenue
    SR 44 from Old New York Road to SR 15A                          SR 44 from Hill Avenue to Blue Lake Avenue
    SR 44 from SR 15A to Stone Street                               SR 44 from Blue Lake Avenue to Kepler Road


EXISTING LOS
As is consistent with Volusia County criteria, the trips generated by the proposed rezoning designation have been
applied to the study area roadway segments to determine the existing level of service (see Table 4). The existing
roadway segments with the addition of trips due to the proposed rezoning all operate within the acceptable level
of service with the exception of SR 44 from Amelia Avenue to Hill Avenue and SR 44 from Blue Lake Avenue to
Kepler Road. Note that in this analysis, the project trips were assigned to the roadway segments rather than the
difference which would have been a negative number, due to the fact that the proposed rezoning shows a
significant decrease in trips compared to the existing zoning designations.

CONCLUSION
This study was conducted to evaluate the impact that a change in zoning designation would have on area
roadways in Volusia County. The results of this rezoning analysis are summarized as follows:

        The existing A-1, A-2 and I-1 zoning designations allow a maximum of 4 single-family dwelling units and
        739.65 KSF of manufacturing land use on the 55.26-acre property.

        The maximum planned development under the proposed MPUD zoning is an Aggregate Facility with 275-
        trucks, 5-employees and 2-mail trucks.

        The proposed rezoning would generate 2,330 less daily and 534 less p.m. peak-hour trips than does the
        existing zoning designation.

        Analysis of existing roadway segment level of service conditions, with the addition of trips generated by
        the proposed rezoning, indicates that all segments will operate within the acceptable level of service with
        the exception of SR 44 from Amelia Avenue to Hill Avenue and SR 44 from Blue Lake Avenue to Kepler
        Road.

Re:       Martin Marietta Aggregate Off-Loading Facility, Deland, Florida



This memo is to summarize what we discussed last week concerning the haul routes likely to be
used by trucks traveling to and from the proposed Deland rail car off-loading facility. I spoke
with Brad McDanal, the Deland project manager, and he advised that Martin Marietta made some
initial investigations in an effort to determine where their potential customers are located relative
to the site. However, no in-depth survey was completed. They concluded the following as the
result of their investigations;

      ·   It is expected that traffic leaving the site will be divided with 60% traveling east and
          40% west.
      ·   The westbound traffic (40%) is expected to serve three existing asphalt plants that are
          located in that direction, plus the western route provides a direct route to the
          communities that make up the growing NW Orlando area.
      ·   It is estimated that 60% of the total loads leaving the site are bound directly to
          construction sites (primarily major road construction projects).
      ·   The remaining 40% of the loads are apt to go to various asphalt and concrete suppliers in
          the region
      ·   It is further estimated that 60% of the loads destined for construction sites (36% of the
          total) are expected to travel to Interstate 4 with half going north and half south.
      ·   Trucks looking to travel north on I-4 are apt to use SR-44 through downtown Deland.
          This would include approximately 18% of the trips.

Brad also confirmed that the most trucks that they can handle each day are approximately 225.
This is the maximum number they can physically load and process each day. He went on to
advise that for them to exceed 225 / day, they must add additional loading equipment and scales
to the project plan.

The above estimates are based on Martin Marietta's experience with similar facilities. Let me
know if there is any other information that you need.

Re: DeLand Rail Yard ­Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) and Rezoning Analysis Methodology (Version 4)

Dear Mr. Cheney:

Lassiter Transportation Group, Inc. (LTG) has prepared a TIA for DeLand Rail Yard on behalf of East Bay Group,
Inc., which was submitted to Volusia County (in the amount of five printed copies plus one electronic version) on
March 26, 2010. The development will be located along SR 44 east of the railroad tracks and west of Grand
Avenue in Volusia County (see Figure 1 for general location). Access to the proposed development will be
provided via one driveway on SR 44 (see attached conceptual site plan). Build-out of the development is
anticipated by the end of 2011. This methodology letter has been revised from the April 7, 2010 submittal to
include the trip generation calculations for the maximum existing versus proposed zoning categories.

REPORT FORMAT
Four printed copies and one electronic version of the TIA will be submitted to the County for review. The TIA will have
a title page which will include the development name, the developer's name, company, address and phone number,
the professional engineer's name, company, address and phone number and the TIA preparation date. A table of
contents will be provided which lists the figures, tables, chapters and appendices. A completed TIA Submission
Checklist, as provided by the County, will be submitted with the TIA report.

TRIP GENERATION
                              th
The ITE Trip Generation, 8 Edition was used to calculate the trip generation for the land uses allowed for each
zoning under the existing designations. The ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition does not contain an aggregate
transfer facility, such as the proposed development. Therefore, engineering judgment was used to estimate trips
based on information provided by the owner of the facility (see Exhibit 2 for owner-provided memo). The
development is expected to have 5 employees and a maximum of 275 trucks daily, plus regular mail services.
Table 1 shows the total daily, am. peak-hour and p.m. peak-hour trip generation possible under the existing
designations. The maximum total trip generation possible under the proposed designations are shown in Table 2.
Table 3 indicates the difference between the existing and proposed designations. As indicated in Table 3, the
existing designations generate a total of 2,330 more daily, 411 more a.m. peak-hour, and 534 more p.m. peak-
hour trips than does the proposed development.

IMPACTED ROADWAYS/INTERSECTIONS
The Volusia County Land Development Code requires that the study area consist of roadways within a five-mile
radius (which is also graphically illustrated in Figure 1) on which project traffic is at least one percent of the peak-
hour, two-way capacity (for a project of this size) as well as roadways which are above 90 percent of their
capacity.

Given the nature of the proposed development and the low trip generation relative to the p.m. peak-hour upon
which concurrency standards are based, County Staff has agreed to a review of a methodology which proposes
to study anticipated major truck routes. Distribution of project trips along these anticipated major truck routes has
been derived from information provided by the owner of the facility (see Exhibit 2) and general knowledge of the
study area.

The affected roadway segments are shown in Table 4 and graphically illustrated in Figure 1. Of these roadways,
no segments are expected to be impacted by project traffic to a level of greater that one percent of the adopted
peak-hour, two-way capacity. However, at the request of County staff, SR 44 from the Shell Road to Kepler Road
will be included for study due to significant assignment of project trips and critical and near-critical status along
certain portions of this road segment. The resultant proposed study area intersections and roadway segments
are as follows:

Intersections:
·   SR 44 at Site Drive (future conditions only)
·   SR 44 at Grand Avenue
·   SR 44 at SR 15A
·   SR 44 and US 17/92

Roadway Segments:
·   SR 44 from Shell Road to Kepler Road

ANALYSIS SCENARIOS
Existing Scenario
This includes the analysis of existing traffic on the existing network. The existing network includes all existing roads,
major roads under construction by a non-governmental party, plus all improvements for which construction contracts
have been executed by government agencies at the time the proposed transportation methodology statement is initially
submitted.

Future scenario
This includes the analysis of existing traffic, plus background traffic (derived from growth rates developed using
FDOT's Traffic Trends), plus project traffic assigned to the existing network, and all improvements funded for
construction within the first three years of the City of DeLand Five-Year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and
County's Five-Year Work Program. There are no programmed capacity-enhancing improvements affecting the
proposed study area.

GENERAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS AND SOFTWARE
Both a.m. and p.m. peak-hour intersection analysis will be conducted for this development.

Level of Service (LOS)
LOS will be analyzed for all site-access intersections and the major road segments and intersections included in the
network defined by the IMPACTED ROADWAYS/INTERSECTIONS Section.

Road Segment Analysis ­P.M. Peak-Hour Two-Way
Road segment volumes will be obtained from the most recently available roadway Volusia County segment
counts (currently dated 2008). If the peak-hour two-way traffic is expected to exceed the maximum service
volume of a roadway segment, a transportation analysis may be conducted to determine the service volume
specific to that segment. The procedures documented in the latest version of the Florida Department of
Transportation (FDOT) Quality Level of Service Handbook will be used to determine specific capacity.

Road Segment Analysis ­A.M. Peak-Hour Directional (SR 44 from Site Drive to US 17/92)
A.M. peak-hour directional roadway segment analysis has been requested by the County for certain segments of
SR 44, due to congestion concerns with respect to eastbound a.m. peak-hour traffic. A.M. peak-hour directional
road segment volumes for these segments will be obtained from synopsis counts available from FDOT Florida
Traffic Information Software (currently dated 2008).

Intersection Analysis ­A.M. & P.M. Peak-Hour
The operating conditions at the unsignalized intersections will be analyzed using the Highway Capacity Software,
Version 5.3 (HCS+). HCS+ utilizes the procedures outlined in Chapter 17 of the Highway Capacity Manual, titled
"Unsignalized Intersections."
The operating conditions at the signalized intersections will be evaluated using the Highway Capacity Software
Version 5.3 (HCS+). This software utilizes the methodology outlined in Chapter 16 of the Highway Capacity
Manual, titled "Signalized Intersections". HCS+ analysis at signalized intersections will be based upon existing
Signal Timing Plans provided by Volusia County. For any future HCS+ analysis at a signalized intersection the
minimum green time will be 8 seconds; unless, otherwise approved by Volusia County Traffic Engineering.

It should be noted that the heavy vehicle factors used in the HCS+ analyses of future conditions will be
appropriately modified to reflect the addition of new truck traffic, due to the proposed development.

DISTRIBUTION & TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT
Trip Distribution
Due to the nature of the proposed development, project will be distributed to the regional roadway based on an
estimation of anticipated truck activity, which has been based on information provided by the owner of the facility
(see Exhibit 2) and knowledge of the study area:

    ·   25% to and from the north via SR 15A
    ·   40 % to and from the west via SR 44
    ·   22 % to and from the east via SR 44
    ·   13% to and from the south via US 17 and SR 15A

Trip Assignment
Using the total a.m. and p.m. peak-hour trip generation and the trip distribution pattern, traffic will be assigned to
the study area roadways and intersections.

TRAFFIC COUNTS
Intersection turning movement counts (TMC) will be conducted on a typical weekday (Tuesday, Wednesday or
Thursday) from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. All TMCs used in the TIA will be less than one
year old.

BACKGROUND TRAFFIC GROWTH/FUTURE TRAFFIC
The existing traffic counts will be increased by a growth factor determined using FDOT's Traffic Trends and the
last five years of historical count data. All applied growth rates will be at least two percent, unless a one percent
growth rate can be documented.

LOS STANDARDS
The LOS standards for all major road segments will be consistent with the letter standards per the City of DeLand
adopted Comprehensive Plan on non-SIS State Roads and the County's latest standard on County Thoroughfare
Roads per the adopted Comprehensive Plan (unless the City has adopted a higher LOS standard). The overall
intersection LOS standard is the same as the segment standard except where different segment LOS standards apply
to different legs of the intersection, in which case the overall intersection LOS standard will be the lowest crossing road
standards.

MITIGATION OF IMPACTS
Appropriate roadway and intersection mitigation plans will be identified to adequately address any level of service
issues due to project impacts. Site access needs will be addressed.

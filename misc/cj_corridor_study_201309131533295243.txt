1. Executive Summary
This transportation plan will address the operational needs and opportunities for the City's roadway system and
consider the desire to balance the movement of people through the City to best serve the community. The city
street network represents a significant investment of public resources that will continue to be vital for both the
growth and stability of Carl Junction.

During the development of the plan, the operational conditions of the street network in conjunction with the
community profile and land use was reviewed and the available forecast data and planning growth assumptions
were employed to identify short-term and long-term improvement needs. The previous Joplin Area
Transportation Study Organization's Long-Range Transportation Plan and the City of Carl Junction's
Comprehensive Plan were used as a starting point for this analysis. A survey was conducted to identify the goals
of the community for consideration in setting long term transportation priorities by obtaining some perspective on
the daily experience to the motorists, the character of the community, and future development aspirations.

The following summarizes the recommendations:

Short-range Improvements
Fir Road - Provide shoulders and possibly left turn lanes at the intersections along Fir Road; investigate the long
term benefits of constructing full-width/full-depth shoulders to accommodate additional traffic lanes in the future;
investigate realignment of Lone Elm Drive and Fir Road to make opposing lanes match up; and, consider if it is
feasible to provide a two-way left turn lane (TWLTL) from Joplin Street to 171 along Fir Road; however, this
could wait until development happens in the area because current movements limited to the existing
intersections would not merit this type of facility.
Pennell Street - Provide a signal at Missouri Route 171 and Pennell Street which is tied into the railroad crossing
signals to improve safety; consider providing a channelized right turn lane at Missouri Route 171 (if space
allows); investigate all way stop control at Pennell Street and Joplin Street, rotating stop signs which could be
put into place during school hours, or possibly adding a roundabout; and, consider the need for a 4-way stop at
Pennell Street and Route JJ; however, due to the potential for t-bone accidents at such a location, a roundabout
may be a more viable solution.
Non-Motorized - Determine desired typical section specific to each transportation facility to provide appropriate
pedestrian and bicycle access.
North-South Connector - Determine desired typical section and proactively begin corridor preservation with
advanced right-of-way acquisition.
Long-range Strategies
Fir Road - Potential widening of Fir Road to a 4 or 5 lane road depending on the need for a TWLTL; need for
signals or a roundabout at Fir Road and Briarbrook Drive as well as Lone Elm Drive and Fir Road, respectively;
and, an all way stop at Fir Road and Peace Church Avenue and possibly Joplin Street and Fir Road depending
on development areas.
Pennell Street - Install a 3-way stop at Joplin Street and Pennell Street; and, investigate the potential for a
roundabout at Route JJ and Rte Z/Pennell Street/Walnut Street.
Non-Motorized - Install appropriate pedestrian and bicycle access in conjunction with concurrent roadway
improvements and throughout community as appropriate.
North-South Connector ­ Construct parkway facility to connect Fir Road to Pennell Street with structure across
Center Creek.

2. Previous Plans and Studies
2.1 City of Carl Junction Comprehensive Plan
Several relevant recommendations regarding the road network in Carl Junction and anticipated growth are
provided below. These selected recommendations were derived from the Carl Junction Comprehensive Plan,
dated February 2003:

Recommendation #1: Encouragement of redevelopment of the core downtown
Carl Junction is not essentially a commercial community. But, it does have a core downtown that offers residents
the convenience of local shopping. Added to this convenience is the historic nature of the remaining buildings in
the downtown area. Redevelopment of the area along with encouragement to property owners to restore their
buildings would be an investment in the community.

Recommendation #3: Redevelopment of Pennell Street
Pennell Street is a major thoroughfare in Carl Junction. It is in need of attention. A long term project should be
enacted to include curbing and guttering, installation of sidewalks, resurfacing, and appropriate signage along its
entire route.

Recommendation #4: Additional access to Highway 171
Access to Highway 171 from Pennell Street is sometimes blocked by rail traffic. Highway 171 physically divides
the City. Additional access to the highway should be a priority over the next decade.

Recommendation #5: Street Project
A major effort should be made to upgrade the quality of streets in Carl Junction. The project may include a bond
issue, involve several years, and should include curb and guttering.

Recommendation #6: Walking paths/Sidewalks
Carl Junction is a residential community with many families. The city should explore walking paths and/or
sidewalks that link the schools with the commercial core downtown, housing developments, and the parks.

Recommendation #8: Briarbrook link
Street access to Center Creek Park from Briarbrook Subdivision would help the many families who transport
their children to and from activities in the park and at the ball fields. The current distance and road size prohibits
older children from riding their bikes from home to the park.

Recommendation #9: Parks and recreation development
Carl Junction has a natural waterway. This is an opportunity the City should not overlook. Center Creek Park
could be extended to follow the creek with hiking trails and wildlife habitat preservation. To enact a project of this
size a Parks Director would be required.

Recommendation #10: City-wide retail development
As a residential community, Carl Junction has a responsibility to provide retail availability and convenience to its
residents. A shopping area along Route 171 where it borders the City would provide access to the three major
areas of Carl Junction as well as be available to the traffic that travels between Pittsburg, Kansas and Joplin,
Missouri.

2.2 Joplin 2007 Regional O/D Survey
This study was completed by ETC Institute, under contract to the Joplin Area Metropolitan Planning Organization
with traffic counts conducted by CJW Transportation Consultants. While the purpose of this study was to
determine travel characteristics and trends in the Joplin Region, this data provided a foundation to understand
the through traffic along the perimeter routes of Carl Junction including but not limited to Route JJ and Missouri
Route 171. The findings illustrated in the figures and tables of the O/D survey shown below helped in identifying
appropriate locations in and around Carl Junction for traffic counts for this transportation plan as well as provided
initial areas of focus based on the relevant concentrations of area travel directly impacting Carl Junction's
transportation system.

3. Survey
                           A survey was developed and distributed to key community leaders and stakeholders
                           to organize and accommodate community input into the development of this
                           transportation plan. Participants were asked to share their perspective regarding
                           access, delays, community character, future development and priorities. In addition
                           to answering the questions as presented, participants were asked to provide
                           additional comments. The input assisted in identifying the goals of the community for
                           consideration in setting long term transportation priorities. This transportation plan is
                           intended to aid investment decisions for future improvements. Additionally, the survey
                           allowed the community, as represented by the respondents, to be a part of the
                           decision-making process. The results of this survey noted within the format by which
                           the survey was distributed may be found in Appendix A. Within the document to
                           follow, relevant results of the survey have been noted in the appropriate sections.

4. Existing Conditions
As part of the process of creating a transportation plan for Carl Junction, it is first necessary to look at the
existing conditions of the roadway network. This analysis needs to not only take into account the condition of the
existing street network, but also the way that it is used by the residents and visitors of Carl Junction.


4.1 Study Area

To assess the needs of the City of Carl Junction it was necessary to determine the existing travel patterns in the
area based upon the current roadway network. These travel patterns help to identify where the deficiencies in
the system are located and what degree of improvements may be necessary at this time and in the future. Based
upon the roadway classifications discussed above, it was determined that it would be appropriate to evaluate the
intersections where arterials meet as well as where Briarbrook Drive intersects with Joplin Street on the west
and with Fir Road on the south. The existing study intersections are as follows:


                           Fir Road and Joplin Street
                           Fir Road and N. Peace Church Avenue
                           Fir Road and Briarbrook Drive
                           Fir Road and Lone Elm Drive
                           Fir Road and Missouri Route 171
                           Joplin Street and Briarbrook Drive
                           Joplin Street and Route Z (Pennell Street)
                           Route Z (W. Walnut Street) and Route JJ
                           Route Z (Pennell Street) and Missouri Route 171

4.2 Street Network

The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) has outlined a hierarchy of
roadway classifications which are intended to help in the transportation planning process as well as helping to
define the geometric design recommendations for each class. The City of Carl Junction's roadway network
consists of the following arterial and collector streets as they apply within its City Limits:
         Principal Arterials ­ Missouri Highway 171
         Minor Arterials ­ Missouri Route JJ, Route Z/Pennell Street, Fir Road, Joplin Street
         Collector Streets ­ Briarbrook Drive, Lone Elm Drive, and Gum Road
A principal arterial carries most of the trips to and from an urban area as well as being the primary route for trips
which bypass the city. Most trips which are longer in duration or exit the region entirely will be conducted on
these types of routes. As it relates to Carl Junction, Missouri Route 171 is the only route which falls into this
category. It has also been classified as a principal arterial by MoDOT in the functional classification system for
the Joplin area.
Minor arterials such as the ones listed above are generally those routes which provide connectivity to the
community from the principal arterials. Minor arterials generally allow for more land access than the principal
arterials and allow for more access points for businesses and sometimes residences without penetrating any
identifiable neighborhoods. While only Route Z/Pennell Street is considered a minor arterial by the Joplin area
plan, Route JJ, Fir Road and Joplin Street could be considered minor arterials in the manner in which they serve
the City of Carl Junction. These roads in conjunction with Missouri Route 171 carry all of the traffic that enters or
leaves Carl Junction and are the most important corridors to be considered for commercial growth in the City.
The collector street system provides circulation within neighborhoods, commercial districts and industrial areas.
These routes collect traffic from the local street network and channel trips to the arterials while also distributing
trips from the arterials to their final destinations.
All of the other streets in Carl Junction are local streets which consist of all facilities not in the other categories
and provide direct access to private entrances while discouraging through traffic. Local residential streets should
provide sidewalks, good lighting and other landscaping, where possible, to offer a sense of security to the
neighborhoods. Local commercial streets should provide wide roads for truck access.

4.3 Traffic Counts

A.M. and P.M. peak hour traffic volumes were collected at the existing study intersections from December 2,
2008 through December 5, 2008. Manual traffic counts including turning movements at several intersections
were obtained from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, machine tube counts
were collected over a 3-day period at the intersection of Briarbrook Drive with Joplin Street and on N. Peace
Church Avenue and Lone Elm Avenue. The counts were taken while school was in session to provide a more
accurate picture of the daily volumes which would be expected. These counts may be found in Appendix B.
In general, the A.M. peak hours for all study intersections were determined to be from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. In
the afternoon, the peak hour times varied widely with the intersections in the general vicinity of the Carl Junction
schools having peak times starting around 3:00 P.M. and the intersections located along Fir Road and Missouri
Route 171 having peak hours between 4:45 p.m. to 5:45 p.m.

4.4 Traffic Analysis

4.4.1    Traffic Operation Assessment

The study intersections were evaluated based on the methodologies outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM), 2000 Edition, published by the Transportation Research Board. The HCM "provides a collection of state-
of-the art techniques for estimating the capacity and determining the level of service for transportation facilities,
including intersections and roadways as well as facilities for transit, bicycles and pedestrians"1
The operating conditions at an intersection are graded by the "level of service" experienced by drivers. Level of
service (LOS) describes the quality of traffic operating conditions and is rated from "A" to "F." LOS A represents
the most desirable condition with free-flow movement of traffic with minimal delays. LOS F generally indicates
severely congested conditions with excessive delays to motorists. Intermediate grades of B, C, D, and E reflect
incremental increases in the average delay per stopped vehicle. Delay is measured in seconds per vehicle.
Table 4-1 shows the upper limit of delay associated with each level of service for signalized and unsignalized
intersections.
                           Table 4-1: Intersection Level of Service Delay Thresholds

                        Level of Service (LOS)          Signalized            Unsignalized
                                  A                    < 10 Seconds           < 10 Seconds
                                  B                    < 20 Seconds           < 15 Seconds
                                  C                    < 35 Seconds           < 25 Seconds
                                  D                    < 55 Seconds           < 35 Seconds
                                  E                    < 80 Seconds           < 50 Seconds
                                  F                     80 Seconds             50 Seconds

While one of the primary measurements of traffic operations, LOS, applies to both signalized and unsignalized
intersections, there are significant differences between how these intersections operate and how they are
evaluated. LOS for signalized intersections reflects the operation of the intersection as a whole. While the
individual movements may operate with varying LOS ratings, that is largely a function of the signal timings and
how the intersection is operating relative to other signals in the vicinity. In this instance, there are not currently
many signals functioning in the vicinity of Carl Junction and the signal at Missouri Route 171 and Fir Road
operates as a standalone signal. Higher levels of delay at this intersection could mean that additional
improvements need to be investigated, such as changes to signal timings or additional turn or through lanes.

Unsignalized intersections, in contrast, are evaluated based on the movement groupings which are required to
yield to other traffic. Typically, this includes the left-turns off the major street and the side-street approaches for
two-way stop-controlled intersections. Lower LOS ratings (D, E and F) do not, in themselves, indicate significant
difficulties or the need for additional improvements. In these cases other factors such as volume to capacity
ratios and traffic queues must also be considered to determine necessary improvements. Many times there are
convenient alternative paths drivers could choose which would help to avoid the longer delays. Other times, the
volumes on the unsignalized approaches are relatively minor when compared to the major street traffic and
these delays are considered acceptable because of the need to provide capacity to the heavier through
movement.

The decision to install a traffic signal, which is often considered when lower LOS ratings are projected, should be
based on engineering studies and the warrants for traffic signal installation as outlined in the Federal Highway
Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Signals are typically not recommended in locations
where there are convenient alternative paths, or the installation of a traffic signal would have negative impacts
on the surrounding transportation system. For instance, if the new signalized intersection is located too close to
existing traffic signals it may not be recommended despite meeting the minimum warrants.

In addition to delay (and the corresponding Level of Service), a secondary means of evaluation is often utilized
to assess the overall capacity of the intersection or unsignalized movement. This evaluation is a ratio of volume
to capacity (v/c) that reflects, regardless of delay, the ability to accommodate the existing or projected traffic
volumes over the course of a peak hour. A v/c ratio of 1.00 reflects that the intersection or movement has
reached its capacity.

Lastly, traffic queues are evaluated as part of the analyses. Long traffic queues which extend beyond the amount
of storage available, either between intersections or within turn lanes, can have significant impacts on
operations. The projected vehicular queues are analyzed to ensure the analyses are reflective of the physical
constraints of the study intersections and to identify if additional storage is needed for turn lanes.

The LOS rating deemed acceptable varies by community, facility type and traffic control device. In communities
similar to Carl Junction, a LOS C for signalized intersections is often found to be acceptable. However, at
unsignalized intersections LOS D, E and above are often accepted for low to moderate traffic volumes where the
installation of a traffic signal is not warranted by the conditions at the intersection or the location has been
deemed undesirable for signalization for other reasons, e.g. the close proximity of an existing traffic signal or the
presence of a convenient alternative path.

The Synchro software package was used to evaluate signalized and stop controlled intersections. Documented
results are based on HCM methodology and have been included in Appendix C.

4.4.2    Existing Traffic Conditions

The results of the intersection analysis for the existing conditions during A.M. and P.M. peak hour are
summarized in Table 4-2.

At present, all the intersections are stop controlled intersections with the exception of the new signal at Fir Road
and Missouri Route 171. This peak hour analysis shows that all the intersections perform at acceptable level of
service during the peak hours in existing conditions.
4.5 Safety
Carl Junction's Vision Statement indicates striving
to "provide a safe environment in which to live, to
work and to play." There are always opportunities
to improve transportation safety for pedestrians
and drivers throughout any community. According
to the survey of community leaders and
stakeholders, the residents of Carl Junction have
concerns for the safety of pedestrian and
motorized travelers. At the top of that list of
concerns is improving access to schools and the
parks and playing fields. The railroad crossings
also were noted as a potential opportunity for
improvement. In terms of the roadways, Fir Road
got the most mention. Survey respondents often
sited high traffic volumes and high speed as
potential safety concerns on Fir Road. While the
traffic analysis does support the notion of higher
volumes on Fir Road and some potential to
experience delays, the perceived delays of today
are projected to increase significantly in the future
based on the projected growth discussed in
Section 6. High speeds cause motorist concern
especially with the physical characteristics of Fir
Road which is currently two lanes with no


Figure 4-1 illustrates the locations of recorded traffic accidents that have occurred according to 2003-2007 crash
data. This assisted in identifying areas with documented safety issues. Travel along Pennell Street and Missouri
Route 171 actually presents the most incidents as recorded by law enforcement. However, Fir Road incidents,
though minimal, do support the safety concerns at intersections along Fir road. This crash data in addition to the
traffic analysis present the baseline for the operational conditions of the street network.

4.6 Reality versus Perception

Travel from Route 171 to Pennell Street across the railroad tracks is perceived as having safety issues though
there haven't been as many accidents as would be expected. This is often explained by the tendency of the
community to adapt to the conditions of its surroundings. For example, the photo below shows the railroad
crossing at Ivy Road. Poor sight distance due to the grade or curvature of a roadway is a consideration accepted
by the regular motorist at a particular location and drivers often alter driving patterns to compensate for these
deficiencies.




This is a minor sight distance issue when compared to the Pennell Street railroad crossing and approach to
Missouri Route 171. The railroad crossing presents steep grades in addition to the hazards of the queuing
vehicles potentially backing up near the tracks during periods of delays. Again, Carl Junction motorists are
accustomed to this scenario and choose alternate routes or accommodate the physical characteristics by
reducing their speed and/or providing more distance between their vehicle and the vehicle ahead. While the
crash data doesn't present a safety concern at the railroad crossings, evaluation of the design of the facility and
community perception and modified driving habits do support such claims.

Another transportation perception is motorist delay. This is always relative in terms of what is perceived as
tolerable to each individual motorist and the size of the community. The reality of the technical data presented
previously in Table 4-2 shows the intersection operational analysis for the existing conditions does not present
significant delays. All but two locations are depicted as operating without much delay. However, the survey
respondents highlighted five locations, as shown in Figure 4-2, as presenting delays to motorists. Such
tolerances unique to individual communities are taken into consideration when evaluating transportation
conditions.

5. Future Needs
5.1 Growth and Development

Existing development is clearly defined by the City's current zoning map shown below in Figure 5-1. In general,
the commercial areas are found along Fir Road between Lone Elm Drive and Peace Church Avenue (primarily
on the north side of the street), near the industrial zoned region along State Highway Z where it crosses the
railroad track, and along Pennell Street adjacent to Highway 171. Industrial uses may also be found along State
Highway Z where it crosses the railroad track.

To project future development, the current trends based on overall growth in the City within the existing zoning
were reviewed and input from community leaders and stakeholders in addition to actual developer interest were
applied to those trends. Community profile and land use were expanded using the available forecast data and
planning growth assumptions. All assumptions were verified and agreed upon by community leadership and
stakeholders. Figure 5-2 highlights the areas where growth in industry, commercial and residential development
is anticipated for Carl Junction.

The goal for the community, according to the findings of the survey administered to key community leaders and
stakeholders, is to promote more services and retail offered in Carl Junction such as grocery stores, department
stores, general business services and/or restaurants rather than remain as-is, a residential suburb of Joplin. The
basis of this goal is driven by a desire to increase the tax base to support improvements to Carl Junction rather
than losing the tax money to Joplin. This will reduce Carl Junction's reliance on Joplin and could provide
resources to fund the necessary transportation investments. Funding solutions are discussed in Section 7.




5.2 Traffic Projections

Based on available forecast data for population growth and the community development profile, growth rates were applied
to the traffic data presented in the previous section to project the impacts of the anticipated future growth on the existing
transportation system. Over the next one to five years (2010-2014), the assumed growth rate for Carl Junction is 5% per
year. Between the following six to twenty years (2015-2029), the growth rate is anticipated to be 3% per year. This
methodology provided traffic projections on the existing system if no other improvements were made for the year 2029, as
shown in Table 5-1.

5.3 Non-Motorized Mobility Needs

Promoting non-motorized travel is essential for communities such as Carl Junction to cater to needs of all
citizens. Building an interconnected network of pedestrian accessible transportation system promotes social,
physical and economical health of any community. One of the objectives of Transportation Master Plan is to
provide an assessment of the sidewalk connectivity and recommend improvements.

A cursory review was conducted for all streets identifying existence or absence of sidewalks by manual
inspection. Data on the condition of the sidewalk was not collected. Generally, arterials and collectors do not
have sidewalks even on at least one side of the road. This prevents pedestrians and bicyclists from making
connections to neighborhoods, schools, parks and trails.




City of Carl Junction
Transportation Plan                                   17
The following factors should be considered when prioritizing sidewalk/trail needs:

         Roadway Classification ­ Depending on the roadway classification, typical cross-sections were
         recommended. Sidewalks on both sides of the street are recommended for the arterials and collectors.
         Sidewalks on at least one side of the road are recommended for local streets.

         Pedestrian Activity ­ Generally, the land use surrounding the streets dictates the level of pedestrian
         activity. For example, streets leading to schools and parks have a high potential for pedestrian activity
         and therefore, priority should be given to incorporate sidewalk facilities in these areas.

         Traffic Volume on Adjacent Streets ­ As the traffic on a street increases, the safety of pedestrians and
         bicyclists decreases unless good sidewalks and crosswalks are provided.

         Connectivity ­ Good connectivity between different pedestrian and bicyclist destinations is important to
         encourage regular walking or biking. Connectivity between housing developments, schools and
         commercial centers including the downtown core center should be a priority.

6. Recommended Transportation Improvements and Strategies
Based on the existing conditions as well as the 2029 projections coupled with the future growth anticipated and
community goals, Carl Junction is faced with the following opportunities and challenges for the future:

         Opportunities
                 o Increasing safety via wider shoulders along roadways; Pennell Street, Fir Road and Joplin
                     Street could be improved based on an adopted typical section.
                 o Proposing a new north/south connection through Carl Junction (the two parts of the city
                     are disconnected. A north/south connector would improve access for the residential
                     development with the city services (parks, community center) and retail in the north.
                 o Reducing delays at school entrances (As traffic increases on the major roads, school
                     entrances will need to be observed and possible improvement made).
                 o Improving sidewalks along major streets based on typical section
                 o Encouraging growth by improving the transportation system surrounding retail
                     development; specifically restaurants.
                 o Providing paths for bicycles via bike trails to and in parks.
         Challenges
                 o Development will cause a demand for an improved transportation system; which would
                     require investment and dedicated funding for improvements.
                 o Pennell Street and Fir Road are currently two lanes with limited shoulders. As Carl
                     Junction continues to grow, these roads may experience capacity and safety issues.
                 o North/south connector considerations Areas for connections are developing. Cost and the
                     flood plain running through the center of the City are also challenges to consider.
                 o Several intersections will require improvements in the future based on projected growth.
                     This must be a long term cost evaluation. For example, traffic signals are initially less
                     expensive than roundabouts; however signals require a high degree of maintenance.
                 o Future improvements will likely be required on Route Z in front of the school due to growth
                     and increased traffic in the City.
                 o The railroad crossing at Pennell Street and Missouri Route 171 (Vertical alignment,
                     difficult to eliminate at grade crossing).

6.1 Short-range Improvements

Short-range improvements generally target current deficiencies at specific locations with potential solutions and
budget level opinions of cost. The following outlines the short-range improvements for Carl Junction:

Fir Road Improvements
o Provide shoulders and possibly left turn lanes at the intersections along Fir Road.
o   Investigate the long term benefits of constructing full-width/full-depth shoulders to accommodate additional
    traffic lanes in the future.
o   Investigate realignment of Lone Elm Drive and Fir Road to make opposing lanes match up.
o   Consider if it is feasible to provide a two-way left turn lane (TWLTL) from Joplin Street to 171 along Fir
    Road; however, this could wait until development happens in the area because current movements limited
    to the existing intersections would not merit this type of facility.
o   Note: Any short term improvements or long term strategies for Fir Road will require agency/municipality
    coordination. Modifications to the signals at/or connections to Missouri Route 171 require MoDOT
    cooperation. The south side of Fir Road exists on County right-of-way; therefore any improvements to Fir
    Road will require coordination with the County.

Pennell Street Improvements
o Provide a signal at Missouri Route 171 and Pennell Street which is tied into the railroad crossing signals to
   improve safety.
o In conjunction with the above improvement, consider providing a channelized right turn lane at Missouri
   Route 171 (if space allows).
o Investigate all way stop control at Pennell Street and Joplin Street, rotating stop signs which could be put
   into place during school hours, or possibly adding a roundabout.
o Consider the need for a 4-way stop at Pennell Street and Route JJ; however, due to the potential for t-bone
   accidents at such a location, a roundabout may be a more viable solution.

Non-Motorized Improvements
o Determine desired typical section specific to each transportation facility to provide appropriate pedestrian
   and bicycle access.

North-South Connector
o Discussed further in Section 6.3, determine desired typical section and proactively begin corridor
    preservation with advanced right-of-way acquisition.

6.2 Budget Level Opinions of Cost

In order to program the transportation improvements prioritized in the short term, cost estimates must be
developed to determine how they match with budgetary constraints. Table 6-1 provides a summary of budget
level opinions of cost that may be applied to the potential solutions. The additional design considerations for
traffic calming measures are not included in these costs.

Shoulders   Add shoulders to existing 2-lane for added safety.                                    $30 to $45 per
            Shoulders provide for additional width for vehicle                                    square yard
            recovery and refuge for disable vehicles to minimize
            lane blockages.
Full Depth         Construct full-width/full-depth shoulders to provide for                       $800K per mile
Shoulders          future roadway expansion to be used for driving lane
                   when capacity is needed. Cost is typically 80% of the
                   cost of constructing a lane.
Add-A-Lane         Increase facility capacity by adding lanes. See typical                        $IM per lane mile
                   sections in Figure 6-1.

                   access via a new corridor. Proactive corridor                                  mile plus the cost
                   preservation may be required to keep this a viable                             of the bridge

Signalized         Install signals to control traffic flow. The cost of                           $150K to $ 200K
Intersection       signalization varies whether it is a signal for a 2-3 lane                     per intersection
                   road or a 4-5 lane intersection. This does not include
                   regular maintenance and operations costs required of
                   the signals or the cost of the additional lanes at the
                   intersection.
Roundabout         Install roundabout to direct traffic flow. Roundabouts                         $400K for single
                   offer increased safety (compared to signals) and                               lane roundabout
                   reductions in delay (not only in peak hour performance                         to $ IM for multi-
                   but in off-peak times) and don't require the additional                        lane roundabouts
                   maintenance and operations costs as do signals.

Sidewalks          Install sidewalks (4" deep concrete) with curb and gutter                      $65 per square
                   along major routes.                                                            yard


Marked             Install thermoplastic markings at street corners.                              $0.50 to $5
Crosswalk          Midblock crossings may be appropriate near school                              per linear foot
                   complex.

Pedestrian         Install supplemental pedestrian signal control to indicate                     $1000 to $5000
Count Down         the time remaining before crossing vehicles get `green'                        each
Timer Signal       signal indication. These may be appropriate near school
                   complex in addition to some signalized intersections.

6.3 Long-range Strategies

Long-range strategies include the facilities needed to support future development and complete the major street
system within the City. These long-range strategies include some specific location improvements and also more
general guidelines for future upgrades for both motorized and non-motorized transportation facilities. The
following outlines the long-range strategies for Carl Junction:

Fir Road Improvements
o   Potential widening of Fir Road to a 4 or 5 lane road depending on the need for a TWLTL.
o   Potential need for signals or a roundabout at Fir Road and Briarbrook Drive as well as Lone Elm Drive and
    Fir Road, respectively. These signals should be interconnected to the existing signal at Fir Road and 171.
    Timing modifications to the Fir Road and 171 signal depending on traffic pattern changes may be required.



City of Carl Junction
Transportation Plan                                 21
o   All-way stop at Fir Road and Peace Church Avenue and possibly Joplin Street and Fir Road depending on
    development areas.
Note: If a N-S connector is built into the Briarbrook subdivision, this could also accelerate the need for
improvements at the intersections of Fir Road with Briarbrook Drive and Joplin Street and Briarbrook Drive if
traffic patterns change.
Pennell Street Improvements
o    Install a 3-way stop at Joplin Street and Pennell Street.
o   Investigate the potential for a roundabout at Route JJ and Rte Z/Pennell Street/Walnut Street. May depend
    on traffic changes and development, could be greatly impacted as could everything else if the west side
    connector is built along JJ as this could have a major impact on existing traffic patterns and growth.
Non-Motorized Improvements
o Install appropriate pedestrian and bicycle access in conjunction with concurrent roadway improvements and
   throughout community as appropriate.

North-South Connector
Center Creek divides the city of Carl Junction and there are currently only three main roads - Route JJ, Joplin
Street and Missouri Route 171, which provide North/South mobility. This is a safety, community cohesion and
system connectivity issue for the City. A north-south connector solves a quality of life issue:

         Safety - Improved emergency access increases community safety as new access across Center Creek,
         not affected by high water or railroad crossings like the existing access, would provide reliable, intra-
         community travel for reduced response times.

         Community Cohesion - Currently the community is divided with the area to the south of Center Creek
         currently accommodating the majority of the residences and tax base and yet the community
         government and recreation facilities are located north of the creek. New residential development is
         occurring on to the north so this dominance may shift; however, that does not remedy the issue of
         community cohesion that the connector roadway would provide.

         System Connectivity - A bridge crossing over Center Creek would benefit both the fire and rescue as
         well as help the businesses in town as residents will more easily be able to travel from their
         neighborhood into town for business rather than going elsewhere.

There is a lot of seasonal traffic into Frank Dean Park to access the ball fields. This presents safety issues due
to the lack of adequate parking. The adjacent residents and pedestrians exiting their vehicles along the roadway
are presented with hazards of narrow roadways congested with vehicles and no sidewalks. Using the residential
drive to access Pennell Street from the park presents challenges of poor sight distance as well as back-ups due
to delays accessing Missouri Route 171. To avoid these deficiencies, motorists often opt for the unpaved, gravel
road through adjacent Center Creek Park which is limited by the one-lane bridge crossing an unreliable access
due to flooding. This seasonal traffic issue could benefit with access through Center Creek with a paved,
improved roadway.

The recommended facility for this north-
south connection is a parkway similar to
the one shown in the photo to the right.
A parkway would offer adequate capacity
yet would keep the look and feel of the
adjacent residential and park areas. In
addition to the functionality of a
traditional parkway, other traffic calming
measures could be implemented to deter
higher speed through traffic from being
attracted to this facility rather than using
the more appropriate perimeter facilities.
Appendix D provides examples of such
traffic calming measures. These would
aid in ensuring this facility operates more
as a collector rather than an arterial like
Joplin Street.

7. Funding
Obtaining the resources necessary for the City of Carl Junction to fund any of the transportation system
improvements will require a variety of funding sources. Various sources of funds that could be pursued to make
improvements financially feasible are discussed here:

Capital Improvements Sales Tax

Section 94.577, RSMo., authorizes cities to impose a sales tax of one-eighth, one-fourth, three-eighths or one-
half of one percent on all retail sales in the municipality for the purpose of funding capital improvements,
including operation and maintenance. The sales tax must be authorized by the City Council and approved by a
simple majority of the voters at an election. The City may issue bonds to be retired from revenues derived from
the capital improvements sales tax. This revenue source can be used to construct transportation improvements
and to maintain those improvements anywhere in the City

City Sales Tax

Section 94.510, RSMo. authorizes cities, by a majority vote of its governing body, to impose a city sales tax;
provided that the voters of the City, at a public election, by a majority of those voting, approve the imposition of
the sales tax. The tax may be imposed at the rate of one-half or seven-eighths of one percent or one percent
from the receipts from the retail sale of all tangible personal property or taxable services at retail. Like the real
estate tax, this revenue source can be used for any legitimate governmental purpose to fund costs arising or
programs located anywhere in the City.

Real Property Tax

Mo. Const. art. X, §§ 1; 11(b) and 11(c) and Section 94.400, RSMo., authorize the City to levy taxes on real and
tangible personal property for general municipal purposes. This tax may be imposed annually and is limited to
one dollar per $100 of assessed valuation. The property tax rate may be increased above this limit for a period
not to exceed four years; provided however, that the rate and purpose for the increase has been approved by a
2/3 vote of the City's qualified electors and that the rate is not increased more than thirty cents per $100 of
assessed valuation at any election.

Transportation Plan                                   23
Transportation Sales Tax

Sections 94.700 through 94.755, RSMo. also authorize cities, by a majority vote of the City Council, to pass an
ordinance imposing a sales tax at a rate not to exceed one-half of one percent on the receipts from the retail sale
of all tangible personal property or taxable services within the City. That ordinance, however, does not take
effect until a majority of the electorate voting on the issue approves the imposition of the sales tax. The proceeds
of the tax must be used for transportation purposes, which is defined to include the construction, reconstruction,
repair and maintenance of; the acquisition of lands and right-of-way for; and planning and feasibility studies for
streets, roads and bridges; and the financial support of public mass transportation systems and publicly-owned
airports.

General Obligation Bonds

Subject to certain constitutional and statutory limitations, primary of which is a constitutional limit on the total
amount of debt the City can incur based upon a set percentage of its assessed valuation, the City has the ability
to raise funds for street improvements by the issuance of general obligation bonds. General obligation bonds are
long-term obligations of the City backed by the full faith and credit of the City. This means that the City has an
obligation to raise whatever revenue, from any source available, to pay the yearly principal and interest
payments on the bonds.

Revenue Bonds

The City may issue revenue bonds for limited purposes pursuant to Mo. Const. art. VI, §§ 27(a) and 27(b).
Revenue bonds are distinct from general obligation bonds primarily for the reason that the bonds are retired from
a source of revenue other than real estate property taxes, such as from utility rates, user fees and sales taxes.

Excise Tax

An excise tax is a method of raising revenue by levying a tax on a particular activity. An excise tax has been
defined as a tax that is measured by the amount of business done, income received, or by the extent to which a
privilege may have been enjoyed or exercised by the taxpayer, irrespective of the nature or value of the
taxpayer's assets or investments in business. It is different from a property tax, which is a tax on the assessed
value of property. An excise tax is not subject to the benefit or nexus requirements of a fee imposed pursuant to
a city's police power, as is a street user or impact fee (see below). This means that it is not required that there be
a rational relationship between the tax imposed and the demand for public services created by the activity upon
which the tax is imposed for the tax to be legal.

Right-of-Way Exactions

Exactions are those aspects of development regulations that allow the City to require a person seeking
development approval to give something to the City as a condition of that approval. Traditionally, cities, through
the exercise of their police powers, have required developers to dedicate right-of-way for streets within the
development and for streets abutting the development as a condition of a specific development's approval.
Typically, these right-of-way exactions have been imposed at the time of plan or subdivision plat approval, with
the understanding that the dedication would take place at no cost to the entity requiring the dedication. A right-of-
way exaction is one specific type of exaction. In reality, there are many different types of exactions, including, for
example, park land dedication requirements and requirements that a developer construct a facility, such as a
sanitary sewer, water line or street.

Transportation Plan                                    24
Impact or Street User Fees

A street user or impact fee is a system of monetary exactions on new development that is imposed as a part of
the development approval process. Generally speaking, all fees collected by the City from an individual fee
payer must be spent for improvements to the street network that benefit that fee payer. The amount of the fee
collected with respect to each development cannot exceed an amount that reflects the cost of constructing those
improvements to the street network that are caused by the development. To ensure this legal requirement is
met, separate zones or services areas must be created throughout the City. The configuration of these service
areas is established by determining an area within which all owners of undeveloped property will benefit from
any street improvements made in the area.

Federal/State Programs

The Missouri Department of Transportation administers federal sub-allocated programs that utilize funds
provided under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users
(SAFETEA-LU). These programs are typically funded on an 80% federal match/20% local match basis. The
federal sub-allocated programs are briefly described below:

                  A.       Surface Transportation Program (STP): The STP provides flexible funding that
                  may be used by States and localities for projects on any Federal-aid highway, including the
                  National Highway System (NHS), bridge projects on any public road, transit capital projects,
                  and intracity and intercity bus terminals and facilities.

                  B.        Transportation Enhancements:            Transportation enhancements (TE) are
                  transportation-related activities that are designed to strengthen the cultural, aesthetic, and
                  environmental aspects of the Nation's intermodal transportation system. The transportation
                  enhancements program provides for the implementation of a variety of non-traditional projects,
                  with examples ranging from the restoration of historic transportation facilities, to bike and
                  pedestrian facilities, to landscaping and scenic beautification, and to the mitigation of water
                  pollution from highway runoff.

                  C.        High Priority Demonstration Projects: The High Priority Projects Program provides
                  designated funding for specific projects (commonly referred to as demonstration projects)
                  identified by Congress. The designated funding can only be used for the project as described
                  in the law.

                  D.       State Infrastructure Banks (SIB): The NHS Designation Act (P.L. 104-59, Section
                  350) authorized the DOT to establish the SIB pilot program. A SIB is a State (or multistate)
                  revolving fund that can offer loans and non-grant forms of credit assistance to public and
                  private sponsors.

                  E.        Off-System Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program: This program funds
                  bridge replacement and rehabilitation projects on deficient bridges that are functionally
                  classified as a local road and rural minor collectors. The transportation bill mandates that at
                  least 15 percent and no more than 35 percent of the state's total bridge appropriation be
                  allocated to the counties for use on off-system bridges. The Missouri Highways and
                  Transportation Commission approved 15 percent of the bridge funds for this program. MoDOT
                  administers this program and distributes funding to Missouri counties for project selection.

                  F.        On-System Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program: This program
                  funds bridge replacement and rehabilitation projects on deficient bridges that are functionally
                  classified as urban collectors, rural major collectors and arterials.

Transportation Corporations

Sections 238.300 through 238.367, RSMo. provide for the creation of non-profit transportation corporations.
Transportation corporations are private entities formed to "fund, promote, plan, design, construct, improve,
maintain, and operate one or more [transportation] projects or to assist in such activity." Transportation
corporations are created by submission of an application signed by at least three registered voters to the
Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission requesting that the Commission authorize creation of a
transportation corporation to act within a designated area. The application must include preliminary plans and
specifications, including the proposed plan for financing a project. Projects are limited to those that will be a part
of the state highways and transportation system. The transportation corporation is governed by a board of
directors appointed by the Commission.

Community Improvement Districts

Sections 67.1401 through 67.1571, RSMo. authorize the creation of Community Improvement Districts (CID). A
CID may be initiated by petition signed by 1) property owners collectively owning more than 50% by assessed
value of the real property within the boundaries of the proposed district and 2) more than 50% per capita of all
owners of real property within the boundaries of the proposed district. The petition must include a five-year plan
stating a description of the purposes of the proposed district, the services it will provide, the improvements it will
make and an estimate of costs of these services and improvements to be incurred. The petition must also
include the maximum rates of real property taxes that may be submitted to the qualified voters in the district for
approval, the maximum rates of special assessments and the methods of assessment that may be proposed by
petition, and any other proposed limitations on the powers of the district. The statutes require the City Council to
hold a public hearing on a proposed CID within 45 days after the petition is filed. The CID may be established by
ordinance by the City Council after the public hearing.

Industrial Development Bonds

Sections 100.010 through 100.200, RSMo. authorize cities or industrial development authorities established by
cities to issue industrial development bonds. The basic concept is that the City issues bonds to finance
acquisition of real and/or personal property (equipment) for a development project for a private company. The
City retains ownership of the real and/or personal property and leases it back to the company under a lease-
purchase arrangement whereby by at the end of the term of the bonds, the company acquires ownership of the
property. Typically, the rent paid by the private company corresponds to the required payments on the bonds.

Neighborhood Improvement Districts

Sections 67.453 through 67.475, RSMo. authorize the creation of Neighborhood Improvement Districts (NID).
Under the NID statutes, particular areas of land may be designated by the City Council as a "neighborhood" that
will benefit from a particular public improvement or improvements, including streets and parks. Landowners
within each designated neighborhood must authorize the formation of the NID either by a vote of approval or by
submission of a petition to the City Council signed by the owners of record of at least two thirds, by area, of all
real property located within the proposed NID.

Transportation Plan                                    26
Special Assessment Districts

Chapter 88 of the state statutes authorizes the creation of special assessment districts to finance public
improvements, including street improvements. The statutes provide that a city must draw a district and determine
the improvements to be made that will benefit the district. The City then assigns a portion of the total cost of the
improvements within that area to each parcel in the district. Special tax bills are issued and are payable in sixty
days or in installments over a period of up to ten years. Tax bills paid in installments include interest. .

Special Business Districts

Sections 71.790 through 71.808, RSMo. authorize cities to establish special business districts for specified areas
of the City upon petition by one or more owners of real property in the proposed district. The purpose of the law
is to grant to these districts the power to levy special fees and taxes in each district for the maintenance and
improvement of the special business district. Property owners in the district may be taxed on an ad valorem
basis at the rate of $.85 per $100 of assessed valuation. Businesses may be assessed a license tax (subject to a
protest by businesses representing a majority of the total license taxes). The taxes and fees may be used for the
purpose of maintaining and improving public facilities in the district, including the opening of new streets or the
widening of narrow existing streets.

Tax Increment Financing

The basic concept behind tax increment financing (TIF) is that the redevelopment of the area approved as a
redevelopment district will increase the equalized assessed valuation of the property, thereby generating new
revenues to a city that can be used to pay for specified costs of a redevelopment project. These costs may
include installation, repair, construction and reconstruction of streets and acquisition and construction of other
public facilities within a redevelopment area. Property taxes and other revenues generated by the existing
development in a legislatively defined redevelopment district are frozen when the redevelopment is approved by
the City Council and the increased property tax and a portion of other revenues generated by the new
development are captured and placed in a special fund to pay for the costs of redeveloping the area. Authority
for TIF is located at Sections 99.800 through 99.865, RSMo.

Missouri Downtown and Rural Economic Stimulus Act

MODESA, the Missouri Downtown and Rural Economic Stimulus Act, (Sections 99.915 to 99.1060, RSMo.) was
recently in Missouri to provide an alternative financing mechanism to state and local tax increment financing.
MODESA is designed to provide financing for a "major initiative" redevelopment projects in a city's
downtown/central business district area. MODESA is similar to state and local tax increment financing (TIF) in
that incremental increases in tax revenues are captured to fund redevelopment project costs. MODESA,
however, incorporates some changes and greater flexibility, including, but not limited to, changes regarding state
appropriation and the state tax increments that may be utilized.

Transportation Development Districts

Sections 238.200 through 238.275, RSMo, authorize a city to create transportation development districts (TDD)
encompassing all or a portion of the City. The statutorily-stated purpose of a TDD is to fund, promote, plan,
design, construct, improve, maintain, and operate one or more transportation projects or to assist in such
activity. Once created, a TDD is a separate political subdivision of the state with powers such as condemnation,
the power to contract with parties, to lease or purchase real or personal property, and to sue and be sued. A city
has no control or jurisdiction over TDD projects, unless the control is agreed to by contract. However, the board
of directors of the district cannot increase or decrease the number of projects in the district without first obtaining

authorization of the voters and the approval of the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission and/or the
city, depending on the project.

Urban Redevelopment Corporations (Chapter 353)

Any Missouri city may establish an Urban Redevelopment Corporation to redevelop areas that have been
designated as blighted due to age, obsolescence or physical deterioration. The designated redevelopment area
may be very large or as small as a single lot or building. The corporation may acquire land through eminent
domain. The governing body retains discretion to approve or deny these grants. Under this program, up to 100%
of improvements to real property may be exempt from state and local property taxes for the first 10 years. For
the next 15 years (after the initial 10 year period), 50% of the real property taxes on both the land and
improvements are abated.

City of Carl Junction
Transportation Plan
Transportation Plan Survey:       We want your input.

  Stakeholders, community leaders and interested parties:

  The City of Carl Junction has contracted us, TranSystems, to develop a transportation plan for the City.
  The plan will address the operational needs and opportunities for the City's roadway system and consider
  the desire to balance the movement of people through the City to best serve the community. The city
  street network represents a significant investment of public resources that will continue to be vital for both
  the growth and stability of Carl Junction.

  During the development of the plan, TranSystems will review the operational condition of the street network
  in conjunction with the community profile and land use, employ available forecast data and planning growth
  assumptions, identify short-term and long-term improvement needs and identify priorities. The previous

  Comprehensive Plan will be used as a starting point for the analysis.

  Attached is a four page survey to allow you to be part of this process. We are asking that you share your
  perspective regarding access, delays, community character, future development and priorities. In addition
  to answering the questions as presented, please provide additional comments in the space provided on the
  last page and feel free to use the back of the paper or attach additional sheets if needed. Your input will
  assist in identifying the goals of the community for consideration in setting long term transportation
  priorities. The transportation plan will aid investment decisions for future improvements and we want you
  to be a part of that decision-making process.

From items 1-6 above please select the top two goals/strategies that you think are important for this region
and explain why these two are the most important.

Choice 1. #4. Why? Safety is a concern especially on Fir as it has 4500 cars a day (more than Pennell) causing major delays at
all intersections from Joplin east to Lone Elm. Fir needs wider shoulders as do Pennell and Joplin. The main roads throughout town
have no curbing or shoulders and they can be dangerous for motorists. Travel from Rotue 171 to Pennell across the RR tracks is
perceived as having safety issues though there haven't been has many accidents as would be expected. Fir and Briarbrook also
have high traffic and safety issues.

Choice 2. #6.B. Why? The N/S connector solves a quality of life issue. South of the river is over 50% of the residences and tax
base and yet the area only has one small park and most capital expenditures have been invested in services north of the river.
Access across Center Creek that would not be effected by high water or cross the RR tracks would connect the whole city and
improve emergency access. N/S access is very limited. There is a lot of traffic into Frank Dean Park which could benefit with access
      g Center Creek with a paved,
through                      p        p
                                  , improved  roadway.
                                                     y A bridgeg connecting g N to S would benefit both the fire and rescue as well as
help the businesses in town as residents will more easily get to travel from their neighborhood into town for business rather than
going elsewhere.

Additional Comments:
Add a third lane to Fir from Joplin Street to Lone Elm; Add signal at Lone Elm/Fir and Briarbrook/Fir; Add signal at Joplin/Pennell;
Increase access to parks and recreation; 60% of the area kids have no place to ride a bike especially if they live along Fir Rod.; Too
much traffic and high speeds on Copper Oaks Drive; Limit future development in Briarbrook without through access to Fir or Joplin;
Need more retail to increase sales tax revenues; ; Trail s are already    p g
                                                                     y in progress;
                                                                                  ; More sidewalks would be nice where possible
                                                                                                                        p         and
could be repaired where needed - this can be ongoing progress; More pedestrian access could benefit students walking or biking to
school; Reduce delays to provide better access in or out of town with fast connections in all directions; CJ needs to keep its tax
dollars in CJ rather than spending in Joplin in order to fund more improvements; Include long range planning on transportation
issues that affect CJ 20 years down the road like the west bypass and how CJ will connect to it; Add sidewalks along Pennell;
Improved tax base will reduce tax levy base.

Bike Lanes                A portion of a roadway which has been designated
                          by striping, signing, and pavement markings for
                          the preferential or exclusive use of bicyclists



Bulbouts/Neckdowns/       Curb extensions at intersections that reduce curb-
                          to-curb roadway travel lane widths - This increases
Chokers                   pedestrian safety and could define roadway
                          parking where appropriate.


Center Islands            Raised islands located along the centerline of a
                          roadway that narrow the width at that location



Chicanes/Lateral Shifts   Curb extensions that alternate from one side of the
                          roadway to the other, forming s-shaped curves




Median Barriers           Raised islands located along the centerline of a
                          roadway and continuing through an intersection to
                          block cross traffic.

Police Enforcement        Involve employing the services of law enforcement
                          agencies to impose the local safe vehicle laws,
                          including those for posted speeds and traffic
                          signal/signs



Realigned Intersections   Changes in alignments that convert T-intersections
                          with straight approaches into curving roadways
                          meeting at right angles



Roundabouts               Circular intersection with yield control of all
                          entering traffic and appropriate geometrics to
                          ensure travel speeds less than 30 mph




Speed Humps               Rounded raised pavement devices placed across
                          roadways to slow and/or discourage traffic




Speed Tables/             Flat-topped speed humps often constructed with a
                          textured material to slow traffic
Textured Pavement/

Raised Crossings

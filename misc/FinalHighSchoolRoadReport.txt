I.       INTRODUCTION
A.       Project Background

Teton County is considering a northerly extension of Tribal Trail Road (Connector) to intersect
with WY 22 in the proximity of the WY 22/Coyote Road intersection. While the Wyoming
Department of Transportation (WYDOT) has created a travel demand forecasting model for
Teton County that provides insight on the "macro" impacts on the surrounding road network,
Teton County would like a better understanding of the Connector impacts on a more localized
scale. In particular, Teton County is concerned about the Connector's effects on High School
Road and other roadways in the South Park area during the school term, including key
intersection level of service analysis and identification of non-motorized user safety issues.

To address these issues, a study area was developed that encompassed the entire South Park
area of the County, to assist in determining impacts created by traffic that has an origin or
destination within the South Park Area (local traffic), and traffic that passes through South Park
on the roads within the study area (through traffic). The project boundaries, for purposes of the
network analysis, are generally described as follows:

     ·   East boundary - US Highway 26, 89, 189, 191 (WY 89)
     ·   West boundary - South Park Loop Road and Tribal Trail Road
     ·   North boundary ­ WY 22
     ·   South boundary ­ South Park Loop Road

Figure 1 shows the study area and the site vicinity.

B.       Study Purpose

The purpose of this study was to conduct detailed traffic analyses of the South Park Study Area
road system for four roadway scenario and identify intersection/road corridor modifications that
would address level of service concerns and non-motorized user safety issues. The scenarios
studied included:

·    Existing Conditions - This scenario examines traffic impacts created on the current road
     system under current traffic volumes. For the purpose of this analysis, the year 2008 was
     used.
·    Existing Volumes with Tribal Trail Connector - This scenario examines traffic impacts in
     the study area if Tribal Trail was currently available as a travel route.
·    Year 2030 Baseline Conditions - This scenario examines the traffic impacts associated
     with long range forecasted traffic volumes for the year 2030. It assumes that the only
     change to the road system in the study area would be the addition of an east-west
     connector roadway, located south of High School Road, that would be constructed in
     conjunction with development in that part of South Park.
·    Year 2030 Conditions with Tribal Trail Connector ­ This scenario examines the traffic
     impacts associated with long-range traffic volumes, the new east-west connector, and the
     Tribal Trail Connector available as a travel option in the area.

II.    EXISTING CONDITIONS
A.     Roadway Network

The existing roadway network within the study area includes:

·      WY 89 ­ WY 89 provides the connection between the Town of Jackson and Hoback
       Junction and other communities to the south. From Town through the study area it is a
       four-lane roadway with a continuous center left turn lane, but it narrows to two lanes with
       left turn lanes at key intersections south of the south South Park Loop Road intersection.
       The Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT) is currently conducting an
       Environmental Impact Statement that is considering widening options for the two lane
       section. From Town to High School Road the posted speed limit is 35 mph, which then
       increases to 55 mph from that point south.
·      WY 22 ­ WY 22 provides the connection between the Town of Jackson and Wilson,
       Teton Village and Teton Pass to the west. It is a four lane road with a 35 mph speed
       limit from the WY 89 intersection to Spring Gulch Road, then a two lane road with a 45
       mph speed limit in winter and 55 mph speed limit in summer from that point west.
·      South Park Loop Road ­ South Park Loop Road is an east-west collector roadway that
       runs along the south end of the study area, turns north and continues up to Tribal Trail
       Road/Boyles Hill Road, then turns east and connects back to WY 89. The north WY 89
       intersection is signalized, but all other intersections along the road are unsignalized,
       including the south intersection with WY 89.
·      High School Road ­ High School Road is an east-west collector roadway in the
       northern portion of the study area that connects South Park Loop Road to WY 89. As its
       name suggests, Jackson High School is located along the south side of the road about
       halfway between WY 89 and South Park Loop Road, with Colter Elementary School
       located on the north side of the road opposite the high school. As such, High School
       Road experiences significant activity, both vehicle and pedestrian, at the beginning and
       end of the school day. The WY 89 intersection is signalized (the southern-most signal on
       the highway), the Middle School Road intersection has all-way stop control, and all other
       intersections have two-way stop control.
·      Tribal Trail Road ­ Tribal Trail Road extends north from the South Park Loop
       Road/Boyles Hill Road intersection into a residential neighborhood. It currently
       terminates at Cherokee Lane about ¼ mile south of WY 22, but Teton County
       documents that date as far back as 1983 have identified the possibility of extending it
       from its current terminus north to the highway to provide a connection for the South Park
       area and help ease traffic at the WY 22/WY 89 intersection (the Y).




                                                                                           Page 3
South Park Sub Area and High School Road Corridor                        Transportation Analysis



B.     Surrounding Land Use

Currently the study area can be distinctly divided into two areas. From High School road north,
the study area consists of suburban residential development on the west side and commercial
development on the east along WY 89. South of High School Road the study area takes on a
more rural feel of primarily ranch land and large lot residential properties, with
industrial/commercial development located along WY 89 north of the south South Park Loop
Road intersection. The Rafter J Ranch and Melody Ranch properties provide some higher
density residential development along WY 89 near the south end of the study area, as well.

C.     Traffic Conditions

Traffic Volumes

Existing weekday peak hour and daily traffic volumes along vicinity roadways are shown on
Figure 2. Peak hour and daily volume information was collected from several sources,
including WYDOT (2006), the Teton Meadows Ranch Traffic Impact Analysis (July 2007 and
February 2008), and an origin-destination study conducted for this project (July 2009). These
data were compared and adjusted to reflect a common year (2008). As the figure indicates,
traffic volumes on WY 89 are at their lowest at the south end of the study area (14,100 vehicles
per day (vpd)) and steadily increase toward town, peaking at 40,400 vpd just north of the north
South Park Loop Road intersection Meanwhile, volumes on WY 22 are at their highest just
north of the Y (24,800 vpd), then drop slightly to 23,400 vpd in the vicinity of Coyote Road
where the Connector would intersect the highway.

South Park Loop Road carries 3,800 vpd just west of the south WY 89 intersection, drops down
to 1,600 vpd west of Melody Ranch, then increases slowly as it turns north, peaking at 2,600
vpd just south of High School Road then dropping slightly just north of there. Once it turns east
at Boyles Hill Road traffic increases steadily until it reaches 10,800 vpd just west of the north
WY 89 intersection.

High School Road carries approximately 7,100 vpd just west of WY 89, with Gregory Lane and
the High School drawing off significant volumes so that traffic drops to 1,800 vpd east of South
Park Loop Road.

Tribal Trail Road currently carries around 700 vpd, which is consistent with its current function
as a neighborhood collector road.

Traffic Operations

Traffic operations were evaluated according to techniques documented in the Highway Capacity
Manual, Transportation Research Board (TRB), 2000. Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative
measure of traffic operational conditions, based on roadway capacity and vehicle delay. Levels
of service are described by a letter designation ranging from A to F, with LOS A representing
the best possible operating conditions and LOS F representing over-capacity, or congested
conditions. At signalized intersections an overall level of service is reported, representing a
weighted average vehicle delay for all movements. For unsignalized intersections, levels of
service are calculated for each movement that must yield the right-of-way to other traffic
movements; levels of service are not calculated for free-flow movements, as they are not
subject to intersection delay.

To assess the sufficiency of traffic operations at each intersection, two different sets of level of
service standards are used within the study area. For intersections on state highways,
WYDOT's level of service standard of LOS C or better applies, while for intersections of non-
state highways, Teton County's level of service standard of LOS D or better applies.

Figure 2 shows current levels of service at the key intersections within the study area during the
morning (7-9 AM) and afternoon (4-6 PM) peak periods. As the figure indicates, all three of the
unsignalized non-state highway intersections in the study area operate at LOS B or better and
therefore meet Teton County's Level of Service Standard (LOS D or better).

For the four intersections along state highways, two--the WY 89/North South Park Loop Road
and WY 89/High School Road intersections--operate at LOS C or better during both peak
periods and therefore meet WYDOT's standard.

At the WY 22/WY 89 signalized intersection, afternoon operations currently perform at LOS D,
which exceeds WYDOT's standard. Reconstructing the north leg of the intersection to provide
dual left turn lanes, a through lane and a right turn lane would improve operations to LOS C in
the afternoon and therefore enable it to meet the standard.

At the unsignalized WY 89/South Park Loop Road intersection the eastbound left turn operates
at LOS F during the PM peak hour and thus also exceeds WYDOT's standard. With a traffic
signal the intersection would operate at LOS A in the afternoon and meet the standard.
However, it should be noted that is not uncommon for movements from driveways and side
streets along higher volume roadways to experience poor levels of service, and, as noted in
Chapter 17 (Unsignalized Intersections) of the Highway Capacity Manual (2000):

       In evaluating the overall performance of two-way stop control intersections, it is
       important to consider measures of effectiveness in addition to delay, such as v/c
       ratios for individual movements, average queue lengths, and 95th percentile
       queue lengths. By focusing on a single measure of effectiveness for the worst
       movement only, such as delay for the minor street left turn, users may make less
       effective traffic control decisions.




                                                                                               Page 6
South Park Sub Area and High School Road Corridor                        Transportation Analysis



In the afternoon, the volume to capacity (v/c) ratio for the left turn movement is 0.57, with a 95th
percentile queue length (generally regarded as the longest anticipated queue) of 75 feet, which
is about three vehicles. These measures indicate the movement is operating under capacity
(the v/c ratio is less than 1.0) with relatively minor backups during that period, and suggests the
intersection would not necessarily need to be signalized. In other words, while a signal would
be needed to meet WYDOT's level of service standard, the intersection currently functions
adequately based on other measures. Given this, no improvements would be recommended for
existing conditions.

Based on the analysis, it would appear that the existing road system would need one roadway
improvement to meet County and/or WYDOT level of service standards under current traffic
volume levels:

   ·   WY 22/WY 89 ­ Widen the north leg of this intersection to provide dual southbound left
       turn lanes, a through lane and a right turn lane.

All levels of service worksheets are included in Appendix E.

High School Road Traffic Operations

As noted above, all intersections in the north study area operate at levels of service that meet
Teton County's standards. For High School Road, the signalized intersection at WY 89
operates at LOS A in the morning and LOS B in the afternoon, the unsignalized all-way stop at
Middle School Road operates at LOS B in the morning and LOS A in the afternoon and the High
School Road approaches at South Park Loop Road operate at LOS A/B in the morning and LOS
A in the afternoon.

While these represent excellent to very good levels of service in general, the presence of the
high school does create localized periods of congestion immediately before and immediately
after school. In those cases, the drop off/pick up area within the high school fills up with
vehicles and traffic spills back onto High School Road. These queues peak around five minutes
before school begins and five minutes after it ends, and extend from the Middle School Road
intersection east to the Smith's parking lot. At no time over the course of several days of
observations did the queue extend into the High School Road intersection, but that may occur
with either an expansion of school enrollment or increased westbound traffic volumes on High
School Road during those localized periods.

A discussion of nonmotorized conditions on High School Road and other roadways in the north
study area is presented in Section VII of this study.

III.   EXISTING CONDITIONS WITH TRIBAL TRAIL CONNECTOR
A.     Origin Destination Study

To assist in determining traffic projections for the Tribal Trail Connector, an origin-destination
study was conducted in July 2009. The O-D study was undertaken to provide field data that
quantifies the traffic volume that could potentially use the proposed Connector to WY 22 west of
town. The intent of the study was to quantify the traffic volumes traveling between the West
End (i.e., Teton Pass, Wilson and the Teton Village Road) and the north end of South Park
(local traffic); south South Park (also local traffic); and areas south of Jackson (through traffic),
so survey stations were set up on the west side, in north South Park, in south South Park and
on WY 89 south of South Park. This field data was then used in conjunction with Teton County's
travel demand forecasting model to project traffic volumes on that road in both the near term
and long term. A detailed summary of the O-D study methodology and results is provided in
Appendix B.

Table 1 summarizes the overall traffic forecast for travel between the West End, South Park and
areas south of town and provides the percentage of traffic from each area relative to the total
traffic volume on WY 22 on the west side. As the table indicates, approximately 6,150 vehicles
per day travel between those areas, which represents 27 percent of the total daily traffic volume
on WY 22 at the Snake River Bridge. Of that total, approximately 2,690 vpd (12 percent) is from
the north end of South Park, 1,710 vpd (seven percent) is from south South Park, and 1,710
(eight percent) is through traffic from south of town.

It should be noted that the above volumes represent the total traffic travelling between the west
side and the south end that might potentially use the Connector, but it does not represent an
actual traffic forecast for that road, since it is anticipated that some drivers will continue to use
WY 89 and WY 22 even after the extension is complete and some traffic may use the Connector
to travel between the west side and the Town of Jackson.

B.     Travel Demand Forecasting Model

As noted previously, WYDOT developed a travel demand forecasting model for Teton County to
assist in providing future traffic projections throughout the area. For this analysis, the WYDOT
model was updated with the most recent existing socio-economic forecasts from the
comprehensive plan (data compiled in April 2010) and then calibrated to reflect the existing
traffic volumes within the South Park study area. Once the initial calibration was complete, as a
further check, the model's traffic forecasts of travel between the West End, South Park and
south of town were compared to the results of the O-D study. Table 2 shows the comparison
and indicates the model does a reasonable job of match the O-D study results, forecasting both
south of town to west side and South Park to west side trips within two percent of the O-D study
results.

2. Existing (2008) High School Road Travel Demand Forecasting Model

C.     Traffic Forecasts for Tribal Trail Connector

The calibrated travel demand model was then used to forecast travel pattern changes that
would result from the Tribal Trail Connector under existing traffic conditions. First, a select link
analysis was conducted for the Connector to determine the trip distribution on the local roads
within the study area and to determine the ultimate destinations within the community of all trips
using the new link.

Figure 3 shows the results of the select link analysis for the Connector. As the figure indicates,
the vast majority of the Connector traffic (70 percent) would use the east-west segment of South
Park Loop Road at the north end of the study area to travel between the Connector and either
the local neighborhood/schools/businesses on the west side of WY 89 (in the case of local trips)
or WY 89 (in the case of through trips).

Furthermore, as indicated in the figure and in Table 3, a relatively high portion of the traffic on
the Connector is from local trips that have origins or destinations within the South Park area;
over 60 percent of the traffic on the Connector is local traffic that already uses the South Park
study area road system. Of the 3,600 through trips using the Connector, roughly two out of three
are headed to and from town and only one out of three is headed to and from south of town.

As a final note, the model forecasts indicate that approximately 72 percent of the through trips
between south of Town and the west side would shift to the Connector (1,225 out of 1,700 vpd).

1. Local trips include trips to/from the developments on the east side of WY 89 between South Park Loop
Road and High School Road. If those 750 daily trips are re-classified as through trips, the percentages
change to 52 percent local and 48 percent through trips.

Connector Traffic Using High School Road

High School Road is the second most popular travel route for Connector traffic, but it is
projected to carry far less traffic than the north end of South Park Loop Road in the near term.
As Figure 3 indicates, the west end of High School Road would only attract nine percent of
Connector traffic (roughly 850 vpd). Around 200 vpd of these trips are local traffic with origins or
destinations along High School Road and the rest (650 vpd) is traffic that travels the length of
High School Road to WY 89 and continues south to either other parts of South Park or out of
the study area.

D.     Overall Traffic Forecasts for South Park Study Area

Since the Connector attracts local trips from within South Park in addition to through trips, its
construction will result in changes to existing travel patterns that will increase traffic on some
study area roads and decrease traffic on others.

For instance, a person living along High School Road heading to the west side currently travels
east to WY 89 then north to the Y and WY 22, but with the new Connector might travel west to
South Park Loop Road, then north to WY 22 via Tribal Trail Road. As a result, their change in
travel pattern would reduce traffic on the east end of High School Road and the north part of
WY 89 by one trip, but would add a trip to the west end of High School Road and the north part
of South Park Loop Road.




                                                                                               Page 11
South Park Sub Area and High School Road Corridor                        Transportation Analysis



At the same time a vehicle travelling north on WY 89 might shift over to the Connector using
High School Road, further reducing traffic on WY 89 by one trip north of there, replacing the
local trip on the east end of High School Road from above, and adding an additional trip to the
west end of High School Road and the north part of South Park Loop Road.

The net result of these two travel pattern changes would be two fewer trips on the north part of
WY 89, no change in trips on the east end of High School Road, and two additional trips on the
west end of High School Road and the north part of South Park Loop Road. With the
Connector, it would be anticipated that similar types of trip changes would occur throughout the
study area, and therefore change overall traffic forecasts on each link of most of the study area
roads.

So, to determine the overall net changes in traffic on study area roadways that result from the
Connector's construction, model runs were conducted both with and without the Connector, and
the difference between the two model runs was applied to the existing traffic volumes on the
road network for each critical roadway link. The net changes in daily traffic resulting from the
Connector are presented in Figure 4 and the overall traffic forecasts for the study area are
presented in Figure 5.

Traffic Operations

Figure 5 also shows the projected levels of service at each key intersection within the study
area. As the figure indicates, all four signalized intersections along state highways in the study
area continue to operate at LOS C or better during both peak hours and therefore meet
WYDOT's Level of Service Standards. Of particular note, the shift in traffic away from the Y due
to the Connector improves operations there from LOS D in the afternoon today, with an average
delay per vehicle of 39 seconds, to LOS C with an average delay of 23 seconds per vehicle.
This equates to an overall reduction of approximately 23 vehicle-hours of delay each day during
the afternoon peak hour alone.

Similarly, all three unsignalized non-state highway intersections in the north part of the study
area operate at LOS B or better and therefore also meet Teton County's level of service
standard (while traffic volumes increase because of the Connector, they still remain at a level
where the current traffic control and lane geometry can adequately accommodate them). It
should be noted that construction of the Connector would require a change in traffic control at
the South Park Loop Road/Tribal Trail Road intersection from two-way stop control to all-way
stop control, and no roadway geometry improvements (such as additional turn lanes) would be
required there.

Based on the traffic volume forecasts for Tribal Trail Road and the Connector, it would appear
that the appropriate lane geometry would be one lane in each direction. This geometry will
allow traffic from the existing local roads along it to turn left out of their neighborhoods with
relatively minor delays (around 10-15 seconds per vehicle, which represents LOS B/C
conditions).

High School Road Traffic Analysis 09-076 04/30/10
South Park Sub Area and High School Road Corridor                        Transportation Analysis



The only location that exceeds WYDOT's standard is at the unsignalized WY 89/South Park
Loop Road intersection, where the eastbound left turn operates at LOS E during the PM peak
hour. In the afternoon, the volume to capacity (v/c) ratio for the left turn movement is 0.45, with
a 95th percentile queue length of 50 feet, or two vehicles. These conditions are slightly better
than they are currently because the Connector draws a small volume of traffic from the
developments in the southwest portion of the study area away from this location (roughly 300
vpd). As a result, the movement continues to operate under capacity (the v/c ratio is less than
1.0) with relatively minor queuing during that periods, and would not warrant any improvements.

Based on the analysis, it would appear that the road system could adequately accommodate the
immediate changes in travel patterns and traffic volumes that would result from constructing the
Tribal Trail Connector, with the appropriate laneage and traffic control provided on the new
Connector and one minor improvement to the existing road system:

   ·   WY 22/Tribal Trail Connector ­ Signalize this new intersection and provide an
       eastbound right turn lane, a westbound left turn lane and separate northbound left and
       right turn lanes.
   ·   Tribal Trail Road ­ Construct the Connector as a two lane road. The road's should be
       designed to a 30 mph design speed to maintain reasonable travel speeds and
       discourage it's use as a cut-through route.
   ·   South Park Loop Road/Tribal Trail Road ­ convert this existing intersection from two
       way stop control to all-way stop control.

High School Road Traffic Operations

For High School Road, Figure 4 indicates that construction of the Connector would increase
traffic on the east end by approximately 1,400 vpd and on the west end by 700 vpd, while Figure
5 indicates that these traffic volume changes are slight enough that they don't significantly
change levels of service from existing conditions. Specifically, with the increased traffic the
signalized intersection at WY 89 would continue to operate at LOS A in the morning and LOS B
in the afternoon, the unsignalized all way stop at Middle School Road would continue to operate
at LOS B in the morning but drop from LOS A to LOS B in the afternoon and the High School
Road approaches at South Park Loop Road would drop from LOS A/B to LOS B in the morning
and from LOS A to LOS B in the afternoon. So although there would be some additional delay
associated with the increased traffic, overall corridor operations would continue to be very good.

It should be noted, however, that the localized congestion created by the high school will
continue to occur with the Connector, and that if any increases in traffic due to the Connector
occur during those short periods before and after school, it might result in traffic queues spilling
back past the Smith's parking lot into the WY 89 intersection. It seems more likely, however,
that Connector traffic would avoid High School Road during those brief periods of school activity
and instead use north South Park Loop Road.

IV.    2030 FUTURE BACKROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
A.     Road System Changes

One road system change was assumed for the 2030 background analysis. Teton County is
considering constructing a new connector road between WY 89 and South Park Loop Road
south of High School Road to accommodate future development associated with that part of the
study area, so for the purpose of this analysis, that new connector was assumed to be
completed by 2030 and a part of the background road system.

B.     2030 Traffic Forecasts

The WYDOT travel demand model used to generate the existing traffic volume forecasts
discussed above was also used to generate future traffic conditions. To achieve this, the socio-
economic data that had been developed for the Teton County Comprehensive Plan Update
(from April 2010) was input into the baseline travel demand model that consisted of the existing
road network plus the new connector roadway. The resulting traffic forecast were used in
conjunction with the forecasts from the existing conditions model to develop growth rates for
each link in the sub area, which were then applied to the existing traffic counts on those links.
Figure 6 shows the projected 2030 baseline traffic conditions that resulted from this process.
As the figure indicates, the new east-west connector south of High School Road is anticipated to
carry 5,000 vpd on the east end and 2,100 vpd on the west end. Around 60 percent of this
traffic is from the new development planned for that part of South Park, while the other 40
percent (2,000 vpd) is traffic that has shifted away from South Park Loop Road and High School
Road. As a result of this shift, the 2030 traffic forecasts for north South Park Loop Road just
west of WY 89 is 10,800 vpd, which is the same as existing volumes, while the future forecast
for High School Road is 6,000 vpd, or 1,100 vpd less than existing conditions.

It is also worth noting that 2030 baseline traffic forecasts on WY 89 would exceed 50,000 vpd
north of South Park Loop Road and traffic forecasts on WY 22 north of the Y exceed 40,000
vpd. The volume forecast for WY 89 would be at or above the upper capacity threshold for a
four lane arterial, which would lead to longer periods of higher congestion and call for the
widening of that road to six lanes.

Traffic Operations

Figure 6 also shows the projected levels of service at each key intersection within the study
area. As the figure indicates, under baseline conditions, the Y intersection would operate at
LOS E in both the morning and afternoon. To meet WYDOT's LOS C Standard, WY 89 would
need to be widened to six lanes in each direction through the area (i.e. between north South
Park Loop Road and Pearl Street) and the intersection would need to be widened to provide
dual left turn lanes on the eastbound, westbound and southbound approaches.

The north WY 89/South Park Loop Road and WY 89/High School Road intersections both
operate at LOS C or better and therefore meet WYDOT's standard.

High School Road Traffic Analysis 09-076 05/14/10
South Park Sub Area and High School Road Corridor                        Transportation Analysis



At the WY 89/New East-West Connector Road intersection, outbound left turns would operate at
LOS F in the afternoon peak period. The v/c ratio would exceed 1.0 and 95th percentile queues
are projected to be around 10 vehicles, which would indicate that the intersection would be
better served by a traffic signal.

At the south WY 89/South Park Loop Road intersection, eastbound left turns would continue to
operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour, and the v/c ratio and projected queues would also
continue to be similar to what occurs there today, largely because future traffic volumes are
projected to be quite similar to existing volumes. As a result, it would appear that location would
not warrant any improvements in the long term.

All three of the existing unsignalized non-state highway intersections in the north part of the
study area operate at LOS B or better and therefore also meet Teton County's level of service
standard (while traffic volumes increase as a result of further development throughout the area,
they still remain at a level where the current traffic control and lane geometry can adequately
accommodate them). The unsignalized intersection of the new east-west connector road and
South Park Loop Road would also operate at LOS B or better.

Based on the analysis, it would appear that the baseline road system would need the following
improvements to adequately accommodate 2030 baseline traffic forecasts:

   ·   WY 89 ­ Widen the highway to three through lanes in each direction between north
       South Park Loop Road and Pearl Street.
   ·   WY 89/WY 22 (aka the Y) ­ Widen this intersection to provide two eastbound left turn
       lanes, two westbound turn lanes and two southbound left turn lanes.
   ·   WY 89/New Connector ­ At this new intersection, install a traffic signal and provide a
       northbound left turn lane, a southbound right turn lane, and separate eastbound left and
       right lanes.

High School Road Traffic Operations

As noted above, future traffic volumes on High School Road are forecast to drop by around
1,100 vpd from existing conditions due to the construction of the new east-west connector
roadway to the south. As a result, traffic operations on High School Road are anticipated to be
similar to existing conditions, even with increased development in the South Park area.
Specifically, while the signalized intersection at WY 89/High School Road would drop from LOS
A to LOS B in the morning and from LOS B to LOS C in the afternoon due to increased through
traffic on the highway, the unsignalized all way stop at Middle School Road would continue to
operate at LOS B in the morning and LOS A in the afternoon and the High School Road
approaches at South Park Loop Road would operate at LOS B in the morning and LOS A/B in
the afternoon.




                                                                                           Page 18

The reduction in traffic volumes may also reduce the length of the queues during the localized
congestion immediately before and immediately after school, but it is anticipated that nearly all
of the traffic on High School Road during those periods is associated with the high school, so
residents should not expect any dramatic change from current conditions. In other words,
instead of vehicles back up to the Smith's parking lot, in the future they may instead only back
up to just beyond Gregory Lane, but in either case roadway travelers caught up in that
congestion would experience similar delays.

V.     2030 FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS WITH TRIBAL TRAIL
       CONNECTOR
A.     Traffic Forecasts for Tribal Trail Connector

The travel demand model used to project the above 2030 baseline traffic conditions was also
used to forecast future travel pattern changes that would result from the Tribal Trail Connector.
To do so, the Connector was added to the baseline road system in the model, and traffic
forecasts were developed based on the most recent (April 2010) socio-economic forecasts for
the County from the Comprehensive Plan update.

As was done for existing conditions with the Connector, a select link analysis was conducted for
future traffic on the Connector to determine travel routing on the local roads and to determine
the ultimate destinations within the community of all trips using the new link. Figure 7 shows the
results of the select link analysis for the Connector. As the figure indicates, while most
Connector traffic uses the east-west segment of South Park Loop Road at the north end of the
study area (similar to existing conditions with the Connector), in the future a much greater
percentage of Connector traffic shifts down to High School Road. This is likely a result of
increased traffic and higher congestion on WY 89 north of High School Road in the future, which
increases delays at the north WY 89/South Park Loop Road intersection and makes shifting
over to the new Connector on a road further south a more appealing option.

Furthermore, as indicated in the figure and in Table 4, in the future a higher portion of the traffic
on the Connector would be from trips that have origins or destinations within the South Park
area; 70 percent of the trips in the future would be local trips, versus 60 percent in the existing
analysis. Additionally, of the 4,000 through trips using the Connector, only one out of four are
headed to and from town (down significantly from two out of three in the existing analysis) and
three out of four is headed to and from south of town. This shift away from using the Connector
as alternate route into town may also be a result of increased traffic and congestion on WY 89
north of South Park Loop Road; with fewer trips and less congestion on WY 22 and shorter
delays at the Y, staying on that road would become the more appealing travel option for trips
between the West End and town.

The model forecasts also indicate that approximately 86 percent of the through trips between
south of Town and the West End would shift to the Connector (3,200 out of 3,700 vpd), an
increase of 14 percent from the 72 percent under existing volumes.

1. Local trips include trips to/from the developments on the east side of WY 89 between South Park Loop
Road and High School Road. If those 785 daily trips are re-classified as through trips, the percentages
change to 64 percent local and 36 percent through trips.

As a final note, construction of the Connector is forecast to reduce the travel demand on WY 89
north of north South Park Loop Road and on the new east-west connector south of High School
Road over baseline conditions. As a result, volumes on the highway would peak at 39,700 vpd
and not appear to require widening of the roadway. Meanwhile, volumes on the new collector
are anticipated to be 3,800 vpd on the east end near WY 89 and 1,700 vpd on the west end
near South Park Loop Road.

Connector Traffic Using High School Road

As noted above, High School Road becomes a much more popular travel route for Connector
traffic in the long term future than it is in the near term. As Figure 3 indicates, the west end of
High School Road would attract 28 percent of Connector traffic (roughly 3,700 vpd). As with
existing volumes, around 200 vpd of these trips are local traffic with origins or destinations along
High School Road while the rest (3,500 vpd) is traffic that travels the length of High School
Road to WY 89 and continues south to either other parts of South Park or out of the study area.

B.     Overall Traffic Forecasts for South Park Study Area

As with the existing analysis of the Tribal Trail Connector, to determine the overall net changes
in traffic on study area roadways in the future that result from the Connector's construction,
model runs were conducted both with and without the Connector, and the difference between
the two model runs was applied to the 2030 baseline traffic volumes on the road network for
each critical roadway link. The net changes in daily traffic resulting from the Connector are
presented in Figure 8 and the overall traffic forecasts for the study area are presented in Figure
9.

Traffic Operations

Figure 9 also shows the projected levels of service at each key intersection within the study
area. Of particular note, the shift in traffic away from the Y due to the Connector would enable
that intersection to operate at LOS C during both peak periods without any need for
improvements, with delays that are similar to or slightly better than conditions today.

The north WY 89/South Park Loop Road intersection would operate at LOS D in the afternoon
with the Connector and therefore exceed WYDOT's level of service standard. Widening the
eastbound approach to provide dual left turn lanes and a shared through/right turn lane would
improve operations there to LOS C in the afternoon and thus meet the standard.

The traffic shift also requires a change in traffic control at the unsignalized South Park Loop
Road/Tribal Trail Road intersection, which would need to be upgraded from all-way stop control
(identified as appropriate traffic control for existing volumes with the Connector) to either a
signalized intersection or a roundabout. No roadway geometry improvements (such as
additional turn lanes) would be required there, however. Based on the future traffic volume
forecasts for Tribal Trail Road and the Connector, it would appear that the appropriate lane
geometry would continue to be one lane in each direction (two lane cross-section). This
geometry will allow traffic from the existing local roads along it to turn left out of their
neighborhoods with delays that are slightly longer than in the near term, yet are still reasonable
(around 30 seconds per vehicle, which represents LOS D conditions), and continue to
discourage the use of the road as a high speed cut-through route.

The remaining unsignalized intersections in the north study area operate at LOS B or better and
therefore would continue to meet Teton County's level of service standard (while traffic volumes
increase because of the Connector, they still remain at a level where the current traffic control
and lane geometry can adequately accommodate them). The new east-west connector road
south of High School Road would also operate at LOS B or better at the South Park Loop Road
intersection, but outbound left turns at its intersection with WY 89 would operate at LOS F in the
afternoon peak period. With a traffic signal the intersection would operate at LOS A during both
peak periods and meet WYDOT level of service standards.

At the south WY 89/South Park Loop Road intersection, eastbound left turns would continue to
operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour as they do under existing conditions, and the v/c
ratio and projected queues would also continue to be similar to what occurs there today, largely
because future traffic volumes are projected to be quite similar to existing volumes. As a result,
it would appear that location would not warrant any improvements in the long term.

Based on the analysis, it would appear that the future road system with the Tribal Trail
Connector would need the following improvements to adequately accommodate 2030 baseline
traffic forecasts:

   ·   WY 22/Tribal Trail Connector ­ Signalize this new intersection and provide an
       eastbound right turn lane, a westbound left turn lane and separate northbound left and
       right turn lanes.




                                                                                           Page 25
South Park Sub Area and High School Road Corridor                        Transportation Analysis



   ·   Tribal Trail Road Connector ­ Construct the Connector as a two lane road with a 30
       mph design speed to maintain reasonable travel speeds and discourage it's use as a
       cut-through route.
   ·   Tribal Trail Road/South Park Loop Road ­ Upgrade the traffic control from all way
       stop control to a signalized intersection.
   ·   WY 89/North South Park Loop Road ­ Widen the eastbound approach to provide dual
       left turn lanes and a shared through/right turn lane.
   ·   WY 89/New East-West Connector ­ Signalize this new intersection and provide a
       northbound left turn lane, a southbound right turn lane, and separate eastbound left and
       right lanes.

High School Road Traffic Operations

Future traffic volumes on High School Road with the Connector are forecast to increase to
9,400 vpd west of WY 89, or roughly 2,300 vpd more than existing conditions. As a result, traffic
operations on that road are anticipated to be slightly more congested than they currently are.
Specifically, the signalized intersection at WY 89/High School Road would drop from LOS A to
LOS B in the morning and from LOS B to LOS C in the afternoon, the unsignalized all-way stop
at Middle School Road would drop from LOS B to LOS D in the morning and from LOS A to
LOS C in the afternoon and the High School Road approaches at South Park Loop Road would
drop from LOS A/B to LOS B/C in the morning and from LOS A/B to LOS B/C in the afternoon.

As with all other scenarios, the localized congestion created by the high school will continue to
occur with Connector, and if any of forecast traffic increases in the long term with the Connector
occur during those short periods before and after school, it might result in traffic queues spilling
back past the Smith's parking lot into the WY 89 intersection. It seems more likely, however,
that Connector traffic would avoid High School Road during those brief periods of school activity
and instead use north South Park Loop Road.

VI.       PUBLIC COMMENT
The above information was presented to the community in a public meeting in early June, 2010.
In that meeting South Park residents expressed their concerns with use of the Tribal Trail
Connector as a cut-through route by traffic that does not have an origin or destination within
South Park, and that to avoid that, the focus should be improving the Y first before building the
Connector. They also expressed concerns about the design of the road to collector standards
being insufficient to control travel speeds, and offered up the potential of switching some of the
existing neighborhood intersections on Tribal Trail Road north of Boyles Hill Road from stop-
sign controlled to roundabouts as a means of addressing both cut-through traffic use and travel
speeds. This would appear to be a reasonable solution to those problems from a traffic
engineering perspective and should be explored as a potential alternative as the project moves
forward. Other comments included:

      ·   An additional origin-destination study of winter time travel patterns in the area to capture
          skier traffic and school traffic.

      ·   An origin-destination study of traffic specifically using High School Road.

      ·   A ban on commercial traffic use of the Tribal Trail Connector, if it is constructed.

      ·   Analyze impacts on wildlife of the Tribal Trail Connector.

      ·   Further analysis of the safety and traffic impacts of the proposed WY 22/Tribal Trail
          Connector traffic signal.

      ·   A travel time analysis of the new connector travel route versus the existing Y travel
          route.

      ·   A noise analysis of the neighborhood with and without the Tribal Trail Connector.

All written comments from the public meeting, as well as a review letter and two follow up
clarification letters of the draft version of this transportation analysis prepared by Save Historic
Jackson Hole's transportation consultant, have been included in Appendix A of this study. This
information has been compiled here for use in the development of future alternatives and
analysis scenarios for the project.

VII.     NONMOTORIZED ANALYSIS
In addition to the above traffic assessment, an evaluation of existing conditions that affect the
safety of non-motorized users within the High School Road Corridor study area was conducted.
The types of non-motorized users include recreational bicyclists and pedestrians, commuter
bicyclists, and school children biking or walking to and from school. The study area
encompasses four schools: Colter Elementary, Jackson Hole Middle, Jackson Hole High, and
Summit High Schools. Therefore, the evaluation provides a particular focus on school zone
signing and pavement markings relative to current standards contained in the Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices, FHWA, 2003. Other physical features that influence safety or
functionality, including separate bike/ped paths, sidewalks, on-street bike lanes, roadway
geometrics, and traffic control, have also been considered.

A.       Data Collection

A field data collection effort was conducted in June, 2009. As an initial step, a meeting was held
with Mr. Brian Schilling, Pathways Coordinator for the Jackson Hole Community Pathways
program. The purpose of the meeting was to gain an understanding of the local perspectives
relative to operational or safety concerns with non-motorized travel within the study area. During
the meeting, Mr. Schilling identified the following issues:

     ·   The Town has recently restriped High School Road to add bike lanes. A westbound left-
         turn lane at the High School has also been added.
     ·   A large number of students ride bikes to school from the Rafter J neighborhood, many of
         whom are elementary school kids.
     ·   There is a separated bike path along High School Road from WY 89 west to Middle
         School Road. The Town has plans to extend this path to South Park Loop Road.
     ·   The Town is considering installing roundabouts as a means to reduce vehicle speeds
         and calm traffic at five intersections within the school area: at High School Road/Gregory
         Lane, High School Road/Jackson Hole High School east access, High School
         Road/Middle School Road, Middle School Road/Blair Drive, and Blair Drive/South Park
         Loop Road.
     ·   There are established bike/ped crossings along South Park Loop Road at three
         intersections; at High School Road, Rangeview Drive, and Blair Drive. These non-
         motorized crossings connect the Cottonwood Park neighborhood to the existing bike
         path located along the west side of South Park Loop Road.
     ·   There is a need for improved on-street bike facilities at the east end of High School
         Road. The new left-turn lane for the high school has also reduced the available space for
         bike lanes.

Following the meeting, a field inventory of existing non-motorized conditions was conducted
within the study area. The inventory included traffic control devices, pavement markings, and
roadway geometrics for the following study area roads:




                                                                                           Page 28

         ·   High School Road, WY 89 to South Park Loop Road
         ·   South Park Loop Road, High School Road to WY 89
         ·   Middle School Road, High School Road to Blair Drive
         ·   Tribal Trail Road, South Park Loop Road to northern terminus

A photographic log was compiled, and existing conditions and potential deficiencies relative to
bicycle and pedestrian travel modes were observed.

B.       Existing Deficiencies

High School Road

This two-lane collector roadway extends east-west between WY 89 and South Park Loop Road.
Vehicular travel lanes are generally 12 feet in width, with the remainder of the paved way striped
for on-street bicycle use. The on-street bike lane varies in width, from approximately eight feet
west of Middle School Road to none adjacent to the westbound left-turn lane that has been
striped at the western High School access (aligning with Middle School Road). Between WY 89
and Middle School Road, a separate, paved bike/ped path runs along the north side of High
School Road. This path has some discontinuity adjacent to the Smith's building.

With the exception of the traffic signal at WY 89, traffic control along High School Road is
unsignalized, with all-way STOP sign control at the east high school access and at Middle
School Road. Two-way stop control is used on minor cross street approaches and on
westbound High School Road at South Park Loop Road.

Several speed limits are posted along High School Road: adjacent to Colter Elementary and
Jackson Hole High Schools, a reduced speed zone of 20 mph (7:00 AM to 4:00 PM) is
established by school zone signing. West of the school zone, the speed limit is posted 25 mph.
East of the school zone, the eastbound direction is posted 30 mph, while the westbound
direction is not posted.

Based on the inventory of existing conditions, the following deficiencies were observed along
High School Road (all nonmotorized figures are provided in Appendix C):

     ·   A masonry trash enclosure at Smith's creates a sight distance hazard for users of the
         bike/ped path, as shown in Figure 1.
     ·   The separate bike/ped path becomes discontinuous adjacent to the Smith's building,
         with bike traffic diverted onto the roadway; pedestrians have the option to use the
         sidewalk along the building. Figure 2 is a view looking westbound at the diversion point.
     ·   A bike/ped crossing near the east edge of the high school does not have crosswalk
         pavement marking, as shown on Figure 3.
     ·   Several school zone signs are yellow, rather than the high-visibility fluorescent yellow-
         green color used on most of the school zone signs in this area. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate
         this issue.
     ·   In addition to the incorrect coloring, the S1-1 school crosswalk sign shown in Figure 5 is
         obsolete (crosswalk bars) and is used as an advance warning sign. The use of the older
         style S1-1 is typical throughout the study area.




                                                                                           Page 29

   ·   Figure 6 shows the westbound view approaching South Park Loop Road. Two old edge
       stripes are still visible and may create confusion for on-street bicyclists and motorists.
   ·   Figure 7 shows an existing R2-1 Speed Limit 20 sign on eastbound High School Road
       within the school zone. As the school zone is posted 20 mph between the hours of 7:00
       AM and 4:00 PM, this sign gives a conflicting message.
   ·   Figure 8 shows an existing R2-1 Speed Limit 30 sign on eastbound High School Road
       just east of the school zone. This is inconsistent with the remainder of the roadway,
       which is posted 25 mph except within the school zone during school hours.
   ·   The recent addition of the westbound left turn lane into the high school creates narrow
       shoulders for on-street bike use, as depicted on Figure 9.
   ·   Figure 10 gives the eastbound view at Middle School Road. The westbound left-turn
       lane creates a through-lane off-set for eastbound motorists; note the white minivan
       straddling the centerline.

Middle School Road

Middle School Road is a two-lane local roadway which provides access for Colter Elementary,
Summit High, and Jackson Hole Middle Schools. It extends north from High School Road to
Blair Drive (a neighborhood minor collector). The typical cross section consists of two travel
lanes and no shoulders. A separate, paved bike/ped path is provided along the east side
starting at High School Road; the path crosses over to the west side approaching the middle
school. Traffic control consists of all-way STOP signs at High School Road and at Blair Drive.
The posted speed limit is 20 mph.

The following deficiencies related to non-motorized use were observed along Middle School
Road:

   ·   The view north at the first school crosswalk is shown on Figure 11. The S1-1 signs
       denoting the crosswalk are inconsistent; on the right is an old style S1-1 sign (with cross
       bars). There is no advance warning sign on the northbound approach to this crossing.
   ·   Figure 12 is the view south at the same crossing, showing mismatched S1-1 signs and
       worn pavement markings. Worn crosswalk paint is typical throughout the study area.
   ·   Figure 13 is the view southbound along Blair Drive approaching the intersection with
       Middle School Road. Note the obsolete S1-1 sign used as an advance warning sign for
       the school zone.

Tribal Trail Road

This two-lane collector roadway extends north from the South Park Loop Road/Boyle Hill Road
intersection, providing access for residential users. The roadway is discontinuous just beyond
Cherokee Lane. The basic cross section includes two 12-foot travel lanes and four-foot
shoulders; a southbound left-turn lane to eastbound South Park Loop Road is provided. Traffic
control consists of a STOP sign on southbound Tribal Trail Road at South Park Loop
Road/Boyle Hill Road, and minor cross street approaches are also STOP sign controlled. A
separate, paved bike/ped lane runs along the east side of the roadway, beginning just north of
Seneca Lane. The speed limit on Tribal Trail Road is posted at 35 mph.




                                                                                          Page 30

During the field inventory of existing conditions, the following deficiency was observed:

   ·   As shown on Figure 14, the southbound left-turn lane creates a southbound through-
       lane misalignment at the South Park Loop Road/Boyle Hill Road intersection.

South Park Loop Road

South Park Loop Road is a two-lane collector road that extends west from WY 89 through
residential neighborhoods south of town, curving north to Boyle Hill Road, then east to intersect
again with WY 89 within Jackson. The study area includes the north-south segment between
High School Road and Boyle Hill Road and the east-west segment from Tribal Trail Road to WY
89. The cross-section on the north-south segment consists of two 11-foot lanes with no
shoulders. A separate, paved bike/ped path is provided along the west side of the roadway.
Traffic control consists of a STOP sign on the northbound approach at Boyle Hill Road, with
STOP sign control on minor cross-street approaches. The speed limit on this segment is posted
40 mph.

The east-west segment has a wider cross section, with 12-foot lanes and four-foot shoulders. A
separate bike/ped path extends along the south side from Tribal Trail Road to Blair Drive; east
of this point, an attached four-foot sidewalk is provided. Traffic control is unsignalized, with
STOP signs on the minor cross-street approaches to South Park Loop Road. The speed limit on
this segment is posted 30 mph, except within a signed school zone (approaching Blair Drive),
which is signed 20 mph, 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM.

Based on the inventory of existing conditions, the following deficiencies were observed along
South Park Loop Road:

   ·   The north-south segment is very narrow, with willow trees closely lining the roadway.
       Figure 15 depicts the narrow cross section and potential sight distance issues due to
       roadside vegetation. The 40 mph speed limit seems uncomfortably high, and a recent
       speed study by the Teton County Sheriff's Office indicates the 85th percentile speed at
       33 mph.
   ·   Figure 16 shows a bike/ped crossing at Rangeview Drive. The crosswalk pavement
       markings are much worn. This crossing is not signed, either with crossing signs or with
       advance warning signs.
   ·   Figure 17 is a view looking west at the bike/ped crossing at High School Road. This
       crossing is not signed and the pavement is not marked. It should be noted that the willow
       trees which line South Park Loop Road restrict sight distance for motorists approaching
       the crossing.
   ·   Figure 18 is a view west of the bike/ped crossing at Boyle Hill Road. There is no
       crosswalk pavement marking.
   ·   The pedestrian crossing at White House Drive is depicted on Figure 19. There are
       warning signs at the crossing; however, no advance warning signs are present. There is
       no crosswalk pavement marking.
   ·   Figure 20 is a view east towards Blair Drive. The advance school warning sign
       assembly incorrectly uses an obsolete style S1-1 sign.




                                                                                            Page 31
South Park Sub Area and High School Road Corridor                           Transportation Analysis



     ·       The westbound advance school warning sign approaching Blair Drive is yellow, rather
             than fluorescent yellow green. Figure 21 shows this sign, which is partially obscured by
             vegetation.
     ·       There is an unsigned, unmarked, crossing for an unpaved pedestrian trail at the rear of
             the middle school accessing a mountainside trail. Figure 22 is a view north from the
             middle school property of the crossing.

C.           Improvement Recommendations

Based on the above existing deficiencies, the following improvements are recommended:

General

     ·       Replace any yellow warning signs within the school zones with fluorescent yellow-green
             signs.
     ·       As existing obsolete style S1-1 signs (with cross bars) become faded or damaged,
             replace them with new style S1-1 signs (without cross bars). Advance school warning
             sign installations should include W16-9p supplemental AHEAD plaques. School crossing
             sign installations should include W16-7P Down Arrow supplemental plaques. All new
             school zone signs and supplemental plaques should be fluorescent yellow-green in
             color.
     ·       Refresh worn crosswalk pavement markings throughout the study area.
     ·       Maintain vegetation away from signs.

High School Road

         ·    Relocate, when feasible, the masonry trash enclosure adjacent to the bike/ped path at
              Smith's to improve sight lines to path users for motorists exiting the parking lot.
         ·    Provide crosswalk pavement marking at the bike/ped path crossing near the eastern
              high school property line.
         ·    Remove extraneous edge line pavement markings where present.
         ·    Remove the existing R2-1 Speed Limit 20 mph sign on eastbound High School Road
              within the school zone. This sign conflicts with the school zone signs.
         ·    Replace the existing eastbound R2-1 Speed Limit 30 mph sign just beyond the eastern
              high school boundary with a new Speed Limit 25 mph sign, to be consistent with the
              rest of High School Road.
         ·    Widen the cross section through the new left-turn lane at the high school access to
              provide shoulders for on-street bicycle use.
         ·    Widen the cross section west of Middle School Road to provide redirect striping (or,
              alternatively, an eastbound left-turn lane) and improve lane alignment for eastbound
              through-movements.

Middle School Road

         ·    Provide an advance school warning sign assembly (S1-1, W16-9p) on the northbound
              approach prior to the first crosswalk.




                                                                                              Page 32
South Park Sub Area and High School Road Corridor                             Transportation Analysis



South Park Loop Road

       ·    Widen the cross section on the north-south segment to provide sufficient paved
            shoulders for on-street bicycle use.
       ·    Lower the posted speed limit on the north-south segment to reflect recent speed
            studies.
       ·    Trim roadside vegetation to improve sight distance at bike/ped crossings.
       ·    Widen the cross section just south of Boyle Hill Road to provide either redirect striping
            or a northbound left-turn lane to improve lane alignment for southbound through-
            movements from Tribal Trail Road.
       ·    Provide advance warning sign assemblies (W11-1, W16-9p) on the northbound and
            southbound approaches prior to the existing bike/ped crossing at High School Road.
            Install crosswalk pavement marking across South Park Loop Road at this location.
            Provide crossing sign assemblies (W11-1. W16-7p), northbound and southbound, at
            the crosswalk.
       ·    Provide advance warning sign assemblies (W11-1, W16-9p) on the northbound and
            southbound approaches prior to the existing bike/ped crossing at Rangeview Drive.
            Provide crossing sign assemblies (W11-1, W16-7p), northbound and southbound, at
            the crosswalk.
       ·    Provide advance warning sign assemblies (W11-1, W16-9p) on the northbound and
            southbound approaches prior to the existing bike/ped crossing at Boyle Hill Road.
            Install crosswalk pavement marking across South Park Loop Road at this location.
       ·    Install crosswalk pavement marking at the existing crossing at White House Drive.
            Provide advance warning sign assemblies (W11-2, W16-9p) on the eastbound and
            westbound approaches prior to the crossing.
       ·    Provide crosswalk warning sign assemblies (W11-2, W16-7p) on eastbound and
            westbound South Park Loop Road at the trail crossing at the rear of the middle school.
            Install crosswalk pavement marking at this location.

The above recommendations will help improve safety within the study area for non-motorized
users and school children.

Roundabouts

Other potential improvements, such as roundabouts at select school zone intersections, will
help reduce vehicle speeds and discourage cut-through traffic. Roundabouts tend to reduce the
frequency and severity of accidents, including pedestrian-vehicle collisions, in comparison to
conventional signalized or two-way STOP controlled intersections. Studies in Europe, where
roundabouts are more common, indicate a potential 75 percent reduction in pedestrian
accidents; in the United States, studies suggest the potential reduction is 30 to 40 percent.
Factors that contribute to the safety benefits of roundabouts include:

   ·       Reduced vehicle speeds (15 to 20 mph)
   ·       Simplified vehicle movements (right-turns only)
   ·       Half as many pedestrian/vehicle conflict points
   ·       The splitter islands allow pedestrians to cross one direction of traffic at a time




                                                                                                Page 33
South Park Sub Area and High School Road Corridor                       Transportation Analysis



All-way STOP sign controlled conventional intersections are typically safer than roundabouts for
pedestrians, and blind pedestrians in particular. Because pedestrian crosswalks are provided at
the splitter islands and away from the intersection, travel paths for pedestrians may be longer
and less convenient.

Roundabouts generally do not provide the same level of safety benefits for bicyclists. Typically,
it is better to remove bikes from vehicular traffic onto a separate path, or merge them directly
with traffic through the roundabout. However, because of the reduced speeds and same-
direction travel, the severity of bike/vehicle collisions tends to be less with roundabouts.




                                                                                          Page 34

VIII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Teton County is considering a northerly extension of Tribal Trail Road (Connector) to intersect
with WY 22 in the proximity of the WY 22/Coyote Road intersection. The purpose of this study
was to conduct detailed traffic analyses of the South Park Study Area road system, including the
High School Road corridor, for four roadway scenario and identify intersection/road corridor
modifications that would address level of service concerns and non-motorized user safety
issues. The scenarios studied included:

       ·   Existing Conditions
       ·   Existing Volumes with Tribal Trail Connector
       ·   Year 2030 Baseline Conditions
       ·   Year 2030 Conditions with Tribal Trail Connector

Traffic Analysis Summary

The traffic analysis indicated the following:

Under existing conditions, traffic volumes on WY 89 are at their lowest at the south end of the
study area (14,100 vehicles per day (vpd)) and steadily increase toward town, peaking at
40,400 vpd just north of the north South Park Loop Road intersection. Meanwhile, volumes on
WY 22 are at their highest just north of the Y (24,800 vpd), then drop slightly to 23,400 vpd in
the vicinity of Coyote Road where the Connector would intersect the highway.

The north end of South Park Loop Road is the highest volume non-highway road in the study
area, carrying 10,800 vpd just west just west of the north WY 89 intersection. High School Road
carries approximately 7,100 vpd just west of WY 89, and south South Park Loop Road carries
3,800 vpd just west of WY 89. Traffic on all three roads decreases significantly as one travels
west through the study area. Tribal Trail Road currently carries around 700 vpd, which is
consistent with its current function as a neighborhood collector road.

Based on the analysis, it would appear that the existing road system would need one roadway
improvement to meet County and/or WYDOT level of service standards under current traffic
volume levels:

   ·   WY 22/WY 89 ­ Widen the north leg of this intersection to provide dual southbound left
       turn lanes.

Under existing conditions with the Connector, over 60 percent of the 9,000 vpd on the
Connector is local traffic that already uses the South Park study area road system (5,400 vpd),
and of the 3,600 through trips using the Connector, roughly two out of three are headed to and
from town and only one out of three is headed to and from south of town. The vast majority of
the Connector traffic (6,200 vpd, or 70 percent) would use the east-west segment of South Park
Loop Road at the north end of the study area to travel between the Connector and either the
local neighborhoods on the west side of WY 89 (in the case of local trips) or WY 89 (in the case
of through trips).




                                                                                         Page 35
South Park Sub Area and High School Road Corridor                       Transportation Analysis



High School Road is the second most popular travel route for Connector traffic, but it is
projected to carry far less traffic than the north end of South Park Loop Road in the near term.
The west end of High School Road would attract 850 vpd of Connector trips, with around 200
vpd of these trips being local traffic with origins or destinations along High School Road and 650
vpd traffic that travels the length of High School Road to WY 89 and continues south to either
other parts of South Park or out of the study area.

Based on the analysis, it would appear that the road system could adequately accommodate the
immediate changes in travel patterns and traffic volumes that would result from constructing the
Tribal Trail Connector, with the appropriate laneage and traffic control provided on the new
Connector and one minor improvement to the existing road system:

   ·   WY 22/Tribal Trail Connector ­ Signalize this new intersection and provide an
       eastbound right turn lane, a westbound left turn lane and separate northbound left and
       right turn lanes.
   ·   Tribal Trail Road ­ Construct the Connector as a two lane road with a 30 mph design
       speed to maintain reasonable travel speeds and discourage it's use as a cut-through
       route.
   ·   South Park Loop Road/Tribal Trail Road ­ Convert this intersection from two-way stop
       control to all-way stop control.

Under 2030 background traffic conditions, a new east-west connector would be constructed
south of High School Road. The new connector is anticipated to carry 5,000 vpd on the east
end and 2,100 vpd on the west end. Around 60 percent of this traffic is from the new
development planned for that part of South Park, with the other 40 percent (2,000 vpd) being
traffic that has shifted away from South Park Loop Road and High School Road. As a result of
this shift, the 2030 traffic forecasts for north South Park Loop Road just west of WY 89 is 10,800
vpd, which is the same as existing volumes, while the future forecast for High School Road is
6,000 vpd, or 1,100 vpd less than existing conditions.

It is also worth noting that 2030 background traffic forecasts on WY 89 would exceed 50,000
vpd north of South Park Loop Road and traffic forecasts on WY 22 north of the Y exceed 40,000
vpd. At these volumes the Y would operate at LOS E during both peak periods and exceed the
County's level of service standard. Furthermore, the volume forecast for WY 89 would be at or
above the upper capacity threshold for a four lane arterial, which would lead to longer periods of
higher congestion and call for the widening of that road to six lanes.

Based on the analysis, it would appear that the baseline road system would need the following
improvements to adequately accommodate 2030 baseline traffic forecasts:

   ·   WY 89 ­ Widen the highway to three through lanes in each direction between north
       South Park Loop Road and Pearl Street.
   ·   WY 89/WY 22 ­ Widen this intersection to provide two eastbound left turn lanes, two
       westbound turn lanes and two southbound left turn lanes.
   ·   WY 89/New East-West Connector ­ At this new intersection, install a traffic signal and
       provide a northbound left turn lane, a southbound right turn lane, and separate
       eastbound left and right lanes.




                                                                                          Page 36
South Park Sub Area and High School Road Corridor                         Transportation Analysis




Under 2030 traffic conditions with the Connector, while most Connector traffic uses the east-
west segment of South Park Loop Road at the north end of the study area, a much greater
percentage of Connector traffic shifts down to High School Road than under existing conditions.
This is likely a result of increased traffic and higher congestion on WY 89 north of High School
Road in the future, which increases delays at the WY 89/north South Park Loop Road
intersection and makes shifting over to the new Connector on a road further south a more
appealing option.

Furthermore, in the future a higher portion of the traffic on the Connector would be from local
trips that have origins or destinations within the South Park area; 70 percent of the trips in the
future would be local trips, versus 60 percent in the existing analysis. Additionally, of the 4,000
through trips using the Connector, only one out of four are headed to and from town (down
significantly from two out of three in the existing analysis) and three out of four is headed to and
from south of town. This shift away from using the Connector as an alternate route into town
may also be a result of increased traffic and congestion on WY 89 north of South Park Loop
Road; with fewer trips and less congestion on WY 22 and shorter delays at the Y, staying on
that road would become the more appealing travel option for trips between the west side and
town.

Finally, construction of the Connector is forecast to reduce the travel demand on WY 89 north of
north South Park Loop Road and on the new east-west Connector south of High School Road
over baseline conditions. As a result, volumes on the highway would peak at 39,700 vpd and
not appear to require widening of the roadway. Of particular note, the shift in traffic away from
the Y due to the Connector would enable that intersection to operate at LOS C during both peak
periods without any need for improvements, with delays that are similar to or slightly better than
conditions today.

Based on the analysis, it would appear that the future road system with the Tribal Trail
Connector would need the following improvements to adequately accommodate 2030 baseline
traffic forecasts:

   ·   WY 22/Tribal Trail Connector ­ Signalize this new intersection and provide an
       eastbound right turn lane, a westbound left turn lane and separate northbound left and
       right turn lanes.
   ·   Tribal Trail Road Connector ­ Construct the Connector as a two lane road with a 30
       mph design speed to maintain reasonable travel speeds and discourage it's use as a
       cut-through route.
   ·   Tribal Trail Road/South Park Loop Road ­ Upgrade the traffic control from all way
       stop control to a signalized intersection.
   ·   WY 89/North South Park Loop Road ­ Widen the eastbound approach to provide dual
       left turn lanes and a shared through/right turn lane.
   ·   WY 89/New East-West Connector ­ Signalize this new intersection and provide a
       northbound left turn lane, a southbound right turn lane, and separate eastbound left and
       right lanes.




                                                                                            Page 37

   ·   WY 22/WY 89 ­ Widen the north leg of this intersection to provide dual southbound left
       turn lanes.

Existing Volumes with Tribal Trail Connector

   ·   WY 22/Tribal Trail Connector ­ Signalize this new intersection and provide an

       mph design speed to maintain reasonable travel speeds and discourage it's use as a
       cut-through route.
   ·   South Park Loop Road/Tribal Trail Road ­ Convert this intersection from two way stop
       control to all-way stop control.

       southbound left turn lanes.
   ·   WY 89/New East-West Connector ­ At this new intersection, install a traffic signal and
       provide a northbound left turn lane, a southbound right turn lane, and separate
       eastbound left and right lanes.

Year 2030 Conditions with Tribal Trail Connector

   ·   WY 22/Tribal Trail Connector ­ Signalize this new intersection and provide an
       eastbound right turn lane, a westbound left turn lane and separate northbound left and

   ·   Tribal Trail Road Connector ­ Construct the Connector as a two lane road with a 30
       mph design speed to maintain reasonable travel speeds and discourage it's use as a

Summary of Public Comments on the Traffic Analysis

The above information was presented to the community in a public meeting in early June, 2010.
In that meeting South Park residents reiterated their concerns with use of the Tribal Trail
Connector as a cut-through route by traffic that does not have an origin or destination within
South Park, and that the focus should be improving the Y first before building the Connector.
They also expressed concerns about the design of the road to collector standards being
insufficient to control travel speeds, and offered up the potential of switching some of the
existing neighborhood intersections on Tribal Trail Road north of Boyles Hill Road from stop-
sign controlled to roundabouts as a means of addressing both cut-through traffic use and travel
speeds. This would appear to be a reasonable solution to those problems from a traffic
engineering perspective and should be explored as a potential alternative as the project moves
forward. Other comments included:

   ·   An additional origin-destination study of winter time travel patterns in the area to capture
       skier traffic and school traffic.

   ·   A ban on commercial traffic use of the Tribal Trail Connector, if it is constructed.

   ·   Analyze impacts on wildlife of the Tribal Trail Connector.

   ·   Further analysis of the safety and traffic impacts of the proposed WY 22/Tribal Trail
       Connector traffic signal.

   ·   A travel time analysis of the new connector travel route versus the existing Y travel
       route.

   ·   A noise analysis of the neighborhood with and without the Tribal Trail Connector.

Nonmotorized System Summary

In addition to the above, the following nonmotorized improvements are recommended for the
study area around High School Road:

General

   ·   Replace any yellow warning signs within the school zones with fluorescent yellow-green
       signs.
   ·   As existing obsolete style S1-1 signs (with cross bars) become faded or damaged,
       replace them with new style S1-1 signs (without cross bars). Advance school warning
       sign installations should include W16-9p supplemental AHEAD plaques. School crossing
       sign installations should include W16-7P Down Arrow supplemental plaques. All new
       school zone signs and supplemental plaques should be fluorescent yellow-green in
       color.
   ·   Refresh worn crosswalk pavement markings throughout the study area.
   ·   Maintain vegetation away from signs.




                                                                                              Page 39

High School Road

    ·   Relocate, when feasible, the masonry trash enclosure adjacent to the bike/ped path at
        Smith's to improve sight lines to path users for motorists exiting the parking lot.
    ·   Provide crosswalk pavement marking at the bike/ped path crossing near the eastern
        high school property line.
    ·   Remove extraneous edge line pavement markings where present.
    ·   Remove the existing R2-1 Speed Limit 20 mph sign on eastbound High School Road
        within the school zone. This sign conflicts with the school zone signs.
    ·   Replace the existing eastbound R2-1 Speed Limit 30 mph sign just beyond the eastern
        high school boundary with a new Speed Limit 25 mph sign, to be consistent with the
        rest of High School Road.
    ·   Widen the cross section through the new left-turn lane at the high school access to
        provide shoulders for on-street bicycle use.
    ·   Widen the cross section west of Middle School Road to provide redirect striping (or,
        alternatively, an eastbound left-turn lane) and improve lane alignment for eastbound
        through-movements.

Middle School Road

    ·   Provide an advance school warning sign assembly (S1-1, W16-9p) on the northbound
        approach prior to the first crosswalk.

South Park Loop Road

    ·   Widen the cross section on the north-south segment to provide sufficient paved
        shoulders for on-street bicycle use.
    ·   Lower the posted speed limit on the north-south segment to reflect recent speed
        studies.
    ·   Trim roadside vegetation to improve sight distance at bike/ped crossings.
    ·   Widen the cross section just south of Boyle Hill Road to provide either redirect striping
        or a northbound left-turn lane to improve lane alignment for southbound through-
        movements from Tribal Trail Road.
    ·   Provide advance warning sign assemblies (W11-1, W16-9p) on the northbound and
        southbound approaches prior to the existing bike/ped crossing at High School Road.
        Install crosswalk pavement marking across South Park Loop Road at this location.
        Provide crossing sign assemblies (W11-1. W16-7p), northbound and southbound, at
        the crosswalk.
    ·   Provide advance warning sign assemblies (W11-1, W16-9p) on the northbound and
        southbound approaches prior to the existing bike/ped crossing at Rangeview Drive.
        Provide crossing sign assemblies (W11-1, W16-7p), northbound and southbound, at
        the crosswalk.
    ·   Provide advance warning sign assemblies (W11-1, W16-9p) on the northbound and
        southbound approaches prior to the existing bike/ped crossing at Boyle Hill Road.
        Install crosswalk pavement marking across South Park Loop Road at this location.

        Provide advance warning sign assemblies (W11-2, W16-9p) on the eastbound and
        westbound approaches prior to the crossing.
    ·   Provide crosswalk warning sign assemblies (W11-2, W16-7p) on eastbound and

Subject: Tribal Trails Connection

Paula,

Thank you for the presentation Tuesday. Your management of the meeting was excellent.

A few points that I would like to make:

There is no reference to the impact of a traffic light on HWY 22 as to how it will affect general
traffic on 22. I believe it is one of, if not, the busiest roads in the state. Will this not "Kink the
Hose" and hinder flow of traffic and also create opportunity for accidents?

Is High School road a not place to look at traffic reduction in the interest of student safety instead
of the proposed and I would say, radical increase?

Shouldn't South of Town to West Bank/ Teton Village and reverse traffic be studied during school
and ski seasons?

If through trips are to be discouraged as I believe was the intent, wouldn't a "time of travel"
element need to be included to really judge which way travelers would prefer.

The way to town from the proposed new South Park/Hereford Ranch development would be HS
road.

High School Road is the obvious main link in this connector and should not be considered for
traffic increases at all let alone of this of this volume. The South Park connection should be built
from HWY 89 first or concurrently with the Tribal Trails connection to keep the burden off of HS
Rd.

This proposed project, if built, would drastically affect the unstudied "sound envelope" of
quiet working class neighborhoods.

Thank you,

Dennis Jesse

Subject:      TTCR




Paula,
Please submit my comments to the June 22nd meeting as follows:


Overall concern regarding the benefits versus unacceptable risk of the proposed TTCR still remains the
biggest objection. The glaring and immediate benefits of improvements at the Y are our obvious, first step
solution.

Benefits of traffic alleviation at the Y through the new construction of the TTCR have been projected in
the FHU report, but to what risk to our neighbors, school age children and wildlife ? Projected vehicles per
day (vpd) numbers of 9,000 are compared to the numbers now using Pearl Street (west of Cache) and Snow
King at Flat Creek Bridge. Neither Pearl Street or Snow King have the dense neighborhood housing or
school zone areas that are seen in the Tribal Trail neighborhood streets where the proposed TTCR will be
built. Subsequent traffic off the Connector will pour through the side streets of South Loop Park and High
School Road with untold consequences. By 2030,vpd would be equal to numbers at North Cache at town
square !
Despite repeated community opinion to wildlife values, no mention has been made of the abundant wildlife
that also inhabits and migrates thru this area and the probable impact consequences. An environmental
impact study to determine those effects has not yet been considered.
Current development in the area has made the TTCR an outdated idea, and the FHU data proves it. The
TTCR is too great a risk to our entire South Park neighborhoods, multiple schools and quality of life. This
connector is a slippery slope to cut thru drivers and unsafe road conditions in residential neighborhoods.
There are real lives and neighborhoods at the mercy of unnecessary, heavy traffic volumes. These numbers
will pose unacceptable risk versus benefit.

The logical, first step in solving the benefit versus risk question is to take a look at established intersections
and public roadways to see if there are ways to make traffic improvement benefits with much less risk.
 One obvious solution is to make improvements at the Y intersection. The FHU report also indicates that by
immediately implementing new left hand turn lanes, traffic flow at the Y would be improved significantly.
This seems to be the obvious solution without risk, and at lower/no costs to Jackson residents. This solution
benefits all residents of Jackson on a daily basis. Future improvements at the Y would continue to allow
traffic flow patterns to keep pace with growth and other planned roadway improvements along WY22 and
89.

It will take the cooperation of Town, County and WYDOT to make improvements at the Y as the priority
for our residents. I commend the TAC's work in promoting the idea to separate Y improvements from
 future WY22 widening plans, and Town's adoption of this idea. County Commissioners and WYDOT now
have to get on board. Our first priority should be improvements at the Y intersection. Clear and sound
interpretation of the FHU data would indicate the TTCR project be denied due to current 2010 development
and population density constraints. Clear interpretation of the FHU data points to the priority of Y
intersection updates for immediate consideration and implementation as the solution we all seek.

Subject: Comment on the draft transportation analysis plan for High School Road/South Park
Sub Area

Hi Paula,
Could you submit the below comments for me on the draft analysis plan for High School
Road/South Park Sub
Area.
          Thanks, Kathy


Dear County and Town Officials,
    I attended the presentation for the draft analysis transportation Plan for High School
Road/South Park Sub Area and the Tribal Trails Connector on June 8th and found it painted too
rosy a picture of what would happen to our neighborhoods. It avoids the 800 pound gorilla in the
room. Improving the the Y first. The plan doesn't treat its findings seriously with
the inadequate traffic calming solutions it offers. The forecasts shows the connector fails at South
Park Loop Road at Maverick and Route 89. It gets so congested that traffic then diverts to High
School Road anyway and the new parallel connector road (south of High School Road,
connecting Route 89 and South Park Loop Road) does not pull the traffic it is intended for. It only
winds up expanding the area for development. Adding a traffic light to the Tribal Trails connector
at Route 22 will encourage cut through by regional traffic. They won't want to sit and wait for the
light if they can use the right turn lane to cut through local neighborhoods and avoid stopping all
together.

    I have read articles about other towns and cities where the neighborhood HOAs are saddled
with the cost of local traffic calming to keep cut through traffic out. They can't keep up with the
costs and the cut through driving which has become an art or science to drivers looking for short
cuts. It is a never ending battle to take back the neighborhood. Almost never a good outcome.
    The draft doesn't properly account for how Gregory Lane commercial traffic will then use the
connector on their way back from the west bank past all the schools on west HSR to Gregory
Lane. The South Park Loop Road/Maverick/Route 89 diverter being congested as forecasted in
the analysis diverts the commercial traffic to HSR. This adds to the traffic congestion at the end of
the school day on HSR. There are six schools using HSR. The traffic will be
even more congested on days when there are sports activities and after school functions
happening. That is almost everyday during the school year. The solution is to ban all commercial
traffic from using the TTC. But won't that negate the reasoning for the connector? The traffic
would then be added back to Route 22 and the Y. It looks and sounds like a catch 22 scenario.

    The loser right from the beginning in the analysis is the Ellingwood and Cottonwood Flats
neighborhoods butting up to Northern South Park Loop Road by literally just feet. They were not
mentioned except to lower the speed limit to 30 mph on South Park Loop Road. Indian Trails
Road would be a speedway with 5 extra feet on each side for bikes and extra footage for turning
lanes. That will only exacerbate the speeding problems by giving the driver a sense of open
space for higher speeds. We had the speed limit lowered to 25 mph on west High School
Road because of the speedway perception problem. It helped a little, but the commercial traffic
and most drivers ignore the new lower speed limit anyway. The speed will increase with more
traffic thinking the same way. Pack Mentality.
   In reponse to Mr. Ream's opinion (the senior transportation engineer for Felsburg, Holt and
Ullevig contracted for the draft analysis) on waiting for community voice along with or
vs. neighborhood voice, the community uses High School Road for their children. We as a
community have already spoken out in the comprehensive plan against making High School
Road more congested and unsafe for all our families. Whether it be development proposals or
the Tribal Trails Connector proposal. I might be jumping the gun on waiting for community
response but I thought I would throw it out there along with the 800 pound gorilla that seems to be
overlooked.

   Let's improve the Y first. Then maybe we can put off using the neighborhood roads around
High School Road and Northern South Park as a bypass for our regional roadways and
intersections for a while.

If we are going the federal route for funding I would think the analysis would fair poorly against
the federal general objectives of traffic calming.

US Department of Transportation
Federal Highway Administration


General Objectives of Traffic Calming
To encourage citizen involvement in the traffic calming process by incorporating the preferences
and requirements of the citizens,
To reduce vehicular speeds,
To promote safe and pleasant conditions for motorists, bicyclists, pedestrians, and residents,
To improve the environment and livability of neighborhood streets
To improve real and perceived safety for nonmotorized users of the streets,
To discourage use of residential streets by non-citizens cut through vehicular traffic.

Below is part of just one article I read about the deterioration of neighborhoods
affected by cut through traffic, whether a suburb of a city or a town. I can offer more
examples if you would like me too.

Greater hill Neighborhood Washington DC
·       Cut-through Commuter & Commercial Motor-vehicle Traffic is a Chronic Systemic
Problem
·       It is time, we as a Greater Capitol Hill community, look at cut-through commuter and
commercial motor-vehicle traffic as a chronic systemic problem. In order for our community to
truly thrive as a livable, walkable and bikable village, we need to shift vehicular-traffic routes, for
instance regional and city rush-hours, from the neighborhood street grid to existing principle
arterials and commercial corridors. These motorist/vehicles create hostile, inhabitable
environments throughout our community, from our parks and schools to our residential streets,
and divide neighborhoods, making it treacherous for residents to access (walking, cycling or even
driving) their own community amenities.

(PKS)Very recently, The Transportation Advisory Committee recommended that WYDOT
consider separating reconstruction of the Y from the larger WY 22 project. The Town Council
endorsed the TAC's recommendation and has sent written comment to this effect to WYDOT.
The County Commission has not taken up this matter yet.) (LA) I am aware of the May 24th
meeting , and Town's adoption of your recommendation to separate the reconstruction process.
County now needs to get on board with this idea, together with WYDOT to move forward. I
commend your efforts so far in recognizing this, but as our Technical Advisory Committee, your
group should be bringing all parties together. Is there a plan to do so ?
Thank you for your follow up. My opinion remains, as you are aware, that redesign of the Y must
be done before any secondary new road construction is permitted. This order of priority would
ensure traffic volumes would not be diverted onto secondary new roads to avoid delays at
existing major intersections, but would be used as intended, by local residents only.

Linda,
 
Thanks for your comments regarding the above study.  I've inserted my thoughts/responses below.
 
As you know, the planned next step in this process is to complete a Purpose and Need Statement, the 
draft version of which will be discussed during a public meeting on June 22nd.  The meeting will be held in 
the commons area of the Jackson Hole Middle School (6:30 pm8:00 pm).

Analysis

Paula,
Thank you very much for the traffic analysis results/ attachments. I will be out of town for this
important meeting, but will look forward to our continued discussions.
questions/comments:
       On page 6/7 "existing road system would need one roadway improvement to met County
and/or WYDOT level of service standards under current traffic volume levels. WY 22/WY 89-
Widen the north leg of the intersection to provide dual southbound left turn lanes, a through lane
and a right turn lane."
Presume you are referring to the 'Y'. (PKS ­ Yes. WY 22/US 89 is the "Y". Since any
infrastructure that is built must be designed to accommodate traffic well into the future, the
existing conditions analysis was included only as a means of comparing existing system
deficiencies to what we can, reasonably, expect will be needed in the future (2030). The
consultant's work indicates there are system deficiencies right now and that those deficiencies
will intensify in the coming years.) This action seems understated, (PKS - I realize that
anecdotally the deficiency may seem greater, but the technical analysis shows otherwise. A
significant benefit of the addition of a southbound left turn lane is that it would allow for the north
and south legs of the intersection to operate more efficiently. Right now, the northbound and
southbound legs operate consecutively rather than simultaneously because the southbound leg
has a combined southbound thru/left turn lane that doesn't permit simultaneous turning
movements from the north and south. Separating these movements will permit these legs to
operate at the same time, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the entire intersection.) but if it is as
simple as that, why haven't we done this improvement already ? (PKS ­ The Y falls under the
jurisdiction of WYDOT and has long been envisioned as part of the reconstruction of WY 22,
which has been postponed due to financial constraints and project prioritization by WYDOT. Very
recently, The Transportation Advisory Committee recommended that WYDOT consider
separating reconstruction of the Y from the larger WY 22 project. The Town Council endorsed
the TAC's recommendation and has sent written comment to this effect to WYDOT. The County
Commission has not taken up this matter yet.) What thoughts are given to doing this upgrade
first, before creating the TTCR to establish how the traffic numbers flow ? We can not look at
developing new roads until current roadways/intersections are upgraded to capacity. This is the
only way to ensure that connector roads will not be used as cut through routes. Posting a speed
limit of 30mph will not discourage cutting thru our neighborhoods if the Y traffic is not improved
FIRST. (PKS ­ The "Future Baseline" portion of the analysis does what you've described and
enumerates the roadway system modifications that would be necessary if the Tribal Trail Road
connector isn't constructed. Regarding the question of speed, the analysis recommends the road
be designed, not just posted, for 30 mph. There is a significant difference between the two, which
will make a difference regarding how fast vehicles can travel along the road.)
      The report details the concerns of direct impact of non-motorized traffic around our schools
with the TTCR. "Future traffic volumes on High School Road with the Connector are forecast to
increase to 9,400vpd west of WY 89, roughly more that 2,300vpd than existing conditions." I
believe sidewalks, improved signs, bike/ped lanes and roundabouts are ideas that should be
implemented immediately. Only then, we can even begin to consider adding traffic loads near our
school age children. (PKS - The report included recommendations to improve the safety of
nonmotorized travelers, and the Town recently completed a roundabout study for some
intersections in the study area. Since nearly all the roads in the study area are in the Town, I
would encourage you to contact their Public Works staff for more information regarding their
priorities and planned projects.)
      Lastly, this report gives no consideration to wildlife impact in the area. It is established that
hundreds of wildlife habitat the South Park region. What considerations have been made for their
safely in the additional vpd analysis ? (PKS - This was strictly a number's exercise, so wildlife
impacts were not part of the scope. If construction of the road moves forward, an environmental
review process will be undertaken to look at wildlife and other considerations.)

linda

Subject: Tribal Trails Road and its affect on High School Road

Hello Paula:
I apologize in advance for this email being so succinct, but I am rather pressed for time, but want
to express a few concerns I have in regards to the Tribal Trails Connector being built.

I disagree with the Origin-Destination Study Results (on Page 5 of the handout) presented to the
public on Tuesday, June 8th. After hearing the presentation, the results should be inconclusive.
Inter-community** trips during a school session period were not obtained. There are hundreds of
vehicle trips each school day that affect High School Road that do not even use Highway 89,
originating from:

**
High Country Subdivision
Indian Trails Subdivision
Blair Apartments
The condos, townhomes and apartments bordering White House Drive and South Park Loop
Cottonwood Park
Homes and condos along Boyles Hill Road
Homes on Ely Springs Road
Indian Springs Ranch
Commercial and Residential Apartments and Condos along Gregory Lane
South Park Ranches
Shootin' Iron Ranches
Three Creek Ranch
Polo Ranches
Melody Ranch
Dairyland Estates

All these neighborhoods can easily contribute vehicle use counts a few times a day drive up and
down High School Road to go to:
Any of the 6 schools off of High School Road (including home for lunch and back)
Shop at Smith's Grocery & Pharmacy
Visit any of the commercial properties along High School Road, Gregory Lane, Boyles Hill Road
or South Park Loop
Or just visiting other community area neighborhoods

A comment was made that the heavy traffic times are only when school begins and when it ends.
I disagree. Please check out traffic between 11:30am and 1:00pm and 5pm and 6:15pm Monday
thru Friday. Even in the summer, although school months (9 months a year) can be worse.

My main concern is what High School Road will become if the Tribal Trails Connector opens and
an East-West Collector Road in the Porter Estate does not get developed. I feel the East-West
Collector must open first before the Tribal Trails Road is completed, regardless if there is no
development in the Porter Estate. A September 2009 letter from Robert Gill to the Town and
County suggests he wishes to continue to ranch into the unforeseeable future. Why would Robert
Gill agree to a road going through his ranchland? If this is the case, my suggestion is to table the
Tribal Trails Road until a COMPLETE East-West Collector Road has been established. High
School Road will never be able to handle the cut-through traffic that TTR would produce. No one
traveling south (or north, for that matter) will want to continue traveling 40mph down South Park
Loop when they can head up (or down) High School Road, hit the stop light and venture down the
highway at 55mph. Of course, most will use High School Road.

In the June 8th meeting, I thought I heard that Indian Springs as already extended use of their
road in an emergency situation.

If TTR was established and no East-West Collector was built, you'll be needing a stop light for the
corners of High School Road and Gregory Lane, High School Road and Middle School Road,
Corner Creek Lane and High School Road (both being too close to each other for stop and go
traffic), Rangeview Drive and High School Road. Sounds like a mess to me.

Fixing the 'Y' should be sought after first. If that should fail, then look into other options. Please do
not waste any more time researching the TTR without a (COMPLETELY THROUGH - SPL to
Hwy 89) East-West Collector Road.

And then there is the emotional side of things ... in completing the TTR and not an East-West
Collector beforehand, you'll be responsible for the deterioration of many neighborhoods and their
home's values (just slap them in the face at the same time).

Why not try fixing the 'Y' first?

Thanks for your time.

SUBJECT:          Comments on Draft Teton County South Park Area and High School Road
                  Corridor Transportation Analysis



Dear Mr. Acri,

I have reviewed the May 14, 2010, Draft South Park Area and High School Road Corridor
Transportation Analysis, prepared by Teton County consultant FHU. As you recall, on a number
of occasions over the last year we have requested ­verbally and in writing ­ that the study
provide certain specific analysis results that we need to see/review in order to be able to
understand and accept study results, not to mention to be able to explain them to our
TTCR/South Park area neighborhood constituencies. We also asked that the requested results be
provided to us for review in a timely way (i.e., that the County give us enough time to review
and comment without impacting the study schedule).

For the most part, the requested technical information has been provided as requested
(although ­ due to the less-than-user-friendly software package used ­ the data were not as clear
and easily-compiled/understood as I'd hoped.). The available review time leading up to the
proposed June 8 meeting is inadequate, as there is insufficient time for me to (a) absorb what
was done and what was left out; (b) communicate my findings/advice to you, (c) specify
additional work and major modifications needed, and (d) have the County make the necessary
revisions. I guess we will need to let the chips fall where they may, per the following discussion.


PURPOSE OF TRIBAL TRAILS CONNECTOR ROAD (TTCR)

From the Community's perspective, the sole legitimate traffic-related purpose of TTCR would
be to provide a direct linkage between South Park/TTCR area neighborhoods and WY22 that
doesn't require community traffic to travel out-of-direction to the east and unnecessary use of
US89 and The Y. The local streets and collectors serving the South Park/TTCR area (South
Park Loop, High School Rd, etc) and the land uses adjacent to them are neither designed nor
intended to carry other traffic (i.e., traffic without an origin or destination in the community or
simply circumventing congested intersections). Even the County's insufficiently-defined
functional class "system" makes this clear.

The County's thus-far inexplicitly-stated purpose for the TTCR seems to be to provide that direct
linkage between South Park/TTCR area neighborhoods and WY22, but primarily as a relief for
the US89 and The Y, and not just for local traffic. Unless and until the County's attitude
about/approach to TTCR is brought closer into line with that of the community, it is hard to see
how WYDOT and community design cooperation happens.

Suggestion: It may be useful to take a little time to resolve this "Purpose" issue now, if for no
other reason than to better foster community and public agency interaction.


NECESSARY ANALYSIS UNAVAILABLE

An analysis critical to community understanding of existing conditions and how to proceed is
missing, and I suggest that the Draft Report is not ready for productive review until that analysis
is provided. The missing analysis is that of a road system scenario in which (a) TTCR is used
only by appropriate HSRC/South Park area traffic, and (b) any inappropriate through traffic that
the traffic model thinks that TTCR might attract instead remains on the highway system (WY22
and US89).

(btw: this is an analysis I anticipated having to do for SHJH, although it would be better for the
sake of analytical consistency, etc, if the County were to do it. However, given the County's
compressed schedule and withholding of information ­ still don't have the Synchro intersection
analysis files requested at the outset ­ I have neither the time nor the input data to do so at this
time in time for the imminent June 8 meeting.)

   "Appropriate" and "Inappropriate" HSRC/South Park area traffic

   According to the County's traffic forecasting/assignment model, as compiled in the Draft
   Report, of the 9,000 daily traffic that would use TTCR were it open today, only about 3,000
   (33%) has an origin or destination in the South Park/HSRC Area and does not use US89
   enroute. This is `appropriate' HSRC/South Park area traffic, according to the community-
   understood purpose of TTCR. The remaining 6,000 TTCR traffic ­ including traffic enroute
   to/from south of the South Park area; traffic simply avoiding The Y and shortcutting back to
   US89; and traffic enroute to streets on the east side of Broadway ­ can and should continue
   to use WY22 and US89, as these are the arterials designed/intended to carry such traffic,
   while South Park Loop, High School Road, Tribal Trails, etc are not.

   Similarly, of the 13,300 daily traffic that would use TTCR in 2030 per the Draft Report,
   5,300 (39%) is `appropriate' HSRC/South Park area traffic, and the remaining 8,000 should
   continue to use WY22 and US89.

   It should be recognized that because the scenario analyzed in the Draft Report shows the
   entire 9,000 (extg) and 13,300 (2030) daily traffic using TTCR, the use of South Park area
   streets by 6,000 (extg) and 8,000 (2030) inappropriate TTCR through traffic is validated.
   Furthermore, this also means that under the `with-TTCR' scenarios, WY22 and US89 are

   presumed to be carrying 6,000 (extg) and 8,000 (2030) less daily traffic than they should be,
   and as a consequence, the means of accommodating this traffic on WY22 and US89 are
   ignored in the list of recommended improvements.


PREMATURE TO RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS

Presentation of the Draft Report "as is" ­ particularly with the list of improvements for the
"with-TTCR" scenario ­ sends the message that the traffic forecasts and analyses are being used
not to simply `inform' plan development as they should be, but also to `dictate' plan
development. There is no questioning of the appropriateness or desirability of the TTCR traffic
assigned by the model ­ only acceptance thereof, and a list of improvements needed to support
it.

Unless and until the "appropriate-use-of-TTCR" scenario described above is analyzed ­ and the
TTCR, WY22, US89, AND "Y" improvements necessary to support it are identified ­
presentation of any list of recommended improvements is premature at best, and can be
counterproductive toward the goal of gaining community and agency agreement on a program of
improvements for the area.


NEXT STEPS

STEP 1: [this is what we are doing now] Change the discussion from comparative LOS, and
establish the fact that South Park/HSRC roads should carry local traffic ONLY (per definitions
above), and that South Park/HSRC roads are neither designed nor intended to carry by-pass
through traffic past neighbors' homes, regardless of capacity and LOS issues elsewhere on
State/County roads. (Part of this Step is quantifying the volume of appropriate local traffic ­
which I have d0ne above ­ and constantly referring to that as the TTCR volume, NOT the
model-generated volume, which includes unacceptable through volume as well.)

STEP 2: [this is what we are getting into now] Establish and promote the fact that the State
Highways and County Arterials ­ WY22 and US89 in particular in this case ­ are the facilities
that are intended to carry through non-local traffic, and must be improved to do so. (Part of this
Step is quantifying the volume of through traffic that must be accommodated by the State
Highways and County Arterial system, and constantly referring to that volume as the WY22, The
Y, and US89 volumes, and NOT using the model-assigned volume, which diverts some through
traffic through the community).

STEP 3: Determine the State Highway and County Arterial improvements needed to
accommodate the through traffic on the regional highway system BEFORE any kind of
reasonable, practical judgment can be made on TTCR, because TTCR is clearly a matter that is
secondary to providing adequate regional capacity of the regional highway system..

Technical Attachment:
Underestimate of delay and overstatement of LOS in calculations

The Synchro [intersection analysis] model used to do the traffic operational analyses for the
contained two factors for left turn movements that result in less delay and better LOS in the
analysis results than one would find in the real world. The model employed an excessive
saturation flow rate1 for left turns and an excessive lane utilization factor2 for dual left turns,
which caused the analyses inherently assume that left turn movements are more efficient than
they really are, and as a consequence, the intersection analysis results show the intersections
functioning much better than they really will.

Use of correct left turn saturation flow rates and dual left lane utilization factors yields the
results compiled in Table 1.

                [tbd: need Synchro intersection analysis files requested from County
                                                          ­ OR ­
                                      a lot of time to replicate data entry]




1
    "Saturation flow rate" is the maximum flow rate at which traffic can move through a given intersection. The
    saturation flow rate used in the Synchro model was 1,900 veh/hr for all turning and through movements at all
    intersections. Though this flow rate is appropriate for through movements, it is excessive for turning movements,
    for which actual saturation flow rates are in the 1,200-1,500 veh/hr range. A vast quantity of research and
    observation over the years has found that the average headway (i.e., the time gap between vehicles) of traffic
    moving through intersections at maximum flow rates (saturated conditions) is 1.9­2.0 seconds per vehicle, which
    translates to 1,800­1,900 vehicles per hour. Similar data for turning movements, however, indicate average
    headways of 2.5­3.0 seconds per vehicle, which translate to saturation flow rates for turns of 1,200­1,450
    vehicles per hour.
2
    "Lane utilization factor" is used to specify the relative utilization of the available lanes in a given intersection
    approach. A lane utilization factor of 1.0 indicates that all lanes are being used equally. The Synchro model uses
    a default lane utilization factor of 0.97 for dual left turn lanes, which indicates that the volume in one of the two
    lanes is 94% of the volume in the other. This lane utilization factor may not be appropriate for WY22 and U89
    dual left turn lanes, especially onto sidestreets, because the two left turn lanes will not be used equally at those
    locations. A lane utilization factor of 0.75 (volume in one of the two lanes is half of the volume in the other), at
    most, should be used to analyze these intersections.

SUBJECT:          Clarifications of Issues Associated with Draft Teton County South Park Area and
                  High School Road Corridor Transportation Analysis



Dear Sean and Paula,

Based on the report drafts, the Town/County/public correspondence, the meeting summaries, and
other materials I have seen recently, it seems that several key technical and procedural points
have gotten off track a bit; the purpose of this letter is to clarify those points.


REPRESENTATION/COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE

Expressing the technical concerns of the people who live and/or work in the TTCR/South
Park area.

As you know, my formal clients are Save Historic Jackson Hole and several of the individual
neighborhoods in the Tribal Trails Connector Road (TTCR) area. For the last 2+ years I have
been providing technical and procedural advice to these groups in much the same way that you
advise and serve County elected and appointed officials; i.e., I am serving as these community
groups' technical staff.

Inasmuch as my clients are part of the Teton County/South Park area community, I am assisting
"the community" by helping it to enunciate its concerns about road and transportation planning
issues. To my knowledge, no one has ever claimed that my clients totally and completely
represent the entire community to the exclusion of any other group or individual ­ although in
fact it is worth noting that the level of coordination and cooperation amongst the various
neighborhoods and environmental groups in the area is extraordinary in my experience.

                                                                                            June 18, 2010
                                                                                                   Page 2




NEED & PURPOSE OF TRIBAL TRAILS CONNECTOR ROAD (TTCR)

Defining the Need and Purpose of the proposed project from the perspective of the
people who live and/or work in the TTCR/South Park area.

The Need & Purpose Statement (NPS) the County is developing is a required element of the
environmental process that is defined by the Federal and State governments to ensure that
Federal and State funds are used wisely and efficiently; that the proposed facility has a
demonstrable need and usefulness within the local and regional highway/transportation system.
Such an NPS is an important and useful document, and needs to be completed. Although it is
not clear that such an NPS is required in the case of the County TTCR Project, such an NPS is an
important and useful document, and should be completed.

That being said, however, it should be recognized that the traffic-centric, road-system-focused
perspective of the Federal/State NPS clearly does NOT adequately address the concerns and
perspective of many residents in the surrounding HSRC/South Park area, whose concerns are
just as legitimate and germane as the Federal/State system concerns. Thus there is a need to
enunciate a Need & Purpose Statement from a community perspective in order to help
guide this project in a way that makes it compatible with the values and needs of the
surrounding community. If we are truly trying to come up with the right project in the right
place, then BOTH NPS's are needed, and both can/must be used to develop such a project.

From what I've heard in the community and from what I've seen of other projects and plans
elsewhere, a community NPS could be stated fairly succinctly:

   The sole traffic-related purpose of TTCR should be to provide a direct linkage between
   South Park/TTCR area neighborhoods and WY22 that doesn't require community traffic
   to travel out-of-direction to the east and doesn't require unnecessary use of US89 and
   The Y. The local streets and collectors serving the South Park/TTCR area (South Park
   Loop, High School Rd, etc) and the land uses adjacent to them are neither designed nor
   intended to carry other traffic (i.e., traffic without an origin or destination in the
   community or traffic simply circumventing congested intersections).

There is nothing in Federal, State, or County regulations that would prevent County government
from working with its citizenry to establish such guidelines or requirements for the proposed
TTCR; in fact many/most local governments already have such considerations adopted into their
Transportation Plans explicitly or in the form of functional classification definitions for arterials,
collectors, etc, that discourage and/or prohibit through traffic on some streets.

COORDINATION WITH STATE HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENTS

Regional/State roads should be improved to accommodate Regional/State traffic
demands as a first priority; County roads through residential communities should not be
used to accommodate regional traffic.

A corollary to the community NPS is that the State Highways and County Arterials ­ WY22 and
US89 in particular in this case ­ are the facilities that are intended to carry through non-local
traffic, and must be improved to do so. Accordingly, the State Highway and County Arterial
improvements needed to accommodate the through traffic on the regional highway system need
to be determined BEFORE any kind of reasonable, practical judgment can be made on TTCR,
because TTCR is clearly a matter that is secondary to providing adequate regional capacity of
the regional highway system. After this current rush of TTCR/South Park area analyses are
complete, a truly comprehensive, coordinated, multi-agency assessment of the improvements
needed on WY22, The Y, Broadway, and US89 intersections/interchanges through South Park
should be done PRIOR to further TTCR project development. The resultant set of regional
roadway system improvements should inform and guide the TTCR project, not the other way
around!


LOCAL TRAFFIC VS THROUGH TRAFFIC

Only about 33% of the traffic expected to use the TTCR as proposed would be Local
traffic according to the community's definition of through and local traffic. The other
67% is traffic that can/should remain on the Regional/State road system.

Much of the discussion of TTCR impact and acceptability hinges on the terms "local traffic" and
"through traffic," and those terms are too easily manipulated. In terms of the perspective of the
TTCR/South Park area community, the terms are defined as follows (using the traffic origin-
destination information developed for the HSRC/South Park area)

·   According to the County's traffic forecasting/assignment model, as compiled in the Draft
    Report, of the 9,000 daily traffic that would use TTCR were it open today, only about 3,000
    (33%) has an origin or destination in the South Park/HSRC Area and does not use US89
    enroute. This is "appropriate" Local HSRC/South Park area traffic, according to the
    community-understood purpose of TTCR.

·   The remaining 6,000 TTCR traffic ­ including traffic enroute to/from south of the South Park
    area; traffic simply avoiding The Y and shortcutting back to US89; and traffic enroute to
    streets on the east side of Broadway ­ is inappropriate Through traffic that can and should
    continue to use WY22 and US89, as these are the arterials designed/intended to carry such
    traffic, while South Park Loop, High School Road, Tribal Trails, etc are not.

·   Similarly, of the 13,300 daily traffic that would use TTCR in 2030 per the Draft Report,
    5,300 (39%) is appropriate Local HSRC/South Park area traffic, and the remaining 8,000 is
    inappropriate Through traffic that should continue to use WY22 and US89.

·   It should be recognized that because the scenario analyzed in the Draft Report shows the
    entire 9,000 (extg) and 13,300 (2030) daily traffic using TTCR, the use of South Park area
    streets by 6,000 (extg) and 8,000 (2030) inappropriate TTCR through traffic is validated.
    Furthermore, this also means that under the `with-TTCR' scenarios, WY22 and US89 are
    presumed to be carrying 6,000 (extg) and 8,000 (2030) less daily traffic than they should be,
    and as a consequence, the means of accommodating this traffic on WY22 and US89 are
    ignored in the list of recommended improvements.


TRAFFIC ANALYSIS RESULTS

I am disappointed that you and your consultant are unwilling/unable to provide copies of the
Synchro intersection analysis computer files used to do your HSRC/South Park area analyses.
You have nothing to gain by withholding this information, and in fact the opportunity to have a
more robust review and evaluation of the analysis results ­ which make those results more
valuable ­ is being lost.

Aside from the fact that anyone with any experience with the useful and widely-used Synchro
software package knows that the printed output reports do NOT document all the analysis inputs
and outputs, the fact is that you provided similar documentation for the HSRC/South Park area
trip generation analysis, begging the question why complete intersection analysis should be
withheld? (The trip generation analysis was done on an Excel spreadsheet, and the Excel
spreadsheet with your input data, results, and computations was provided to us. I used my
licensed Excel spreadsheet software to open the file and review the information you provided.
This is all I was asking for in terms of intersection analysis: i.e., for you to provide the Synchro
files with the input data and results, and I would use my licensed Synchro software to open the
files and review the information.)

SUBJECT:          Through Traffic vs Local Traffic in the High School Road Corridor (HSRC) ­
                  South Park area Transportation Analyses



Dear Sean and Paula,

I appreciate the opportunity to further clarify this vexsome issue/definition that seems to lie at
the root of most misunderstandings about the desirability of the Tribal Trails Connector Road
(TTCR).

Need for TTCR

My clients' assertion ­ as expressed to the best of my ability in my June 18, 2010, letter ­ is that
from the perspective of "the neighbors" (i.e., the TTCR/South Park area communities),

    The sole traffic-related purpose of TTCR should be to provide a direct linkage between
    South Park/TTCR area neighborhoods and WY22 that does not require community traffic
    to travel out-of-direction to the east and does not require unnecessary use of US89 and
    The Y. The local streets and collectors serving the South Park/TTCR area (South Park
    Loop, High School Rd, etc) and the land uses adjacent to them ­ see photos below ­ are
    neither designed nor intended to carry other traffic (i.e., traffic without an origin or
    destination in the community or traffic simply circumventing congested intersections).

TTCR Fatal Flaw

A corollary, also expressed in my June 18 letter, is that the State Highways and County
Arterials ­ WY22 and US89 in particular in this case ­ are the facilities that are intended to carry
through non-local traffic, and must be improved to do so. Accordingly, the State Highway and
County Arterial improvements needed to accommodate the through traffic on the regional



507 - 18th Avenue East                                                                    (206) 325-4320

                                                                              Mr. O'Malley, Ms. Stevens
                                                                                          June 18, 2010

highway system need to be determined BEFORE any kind of reasonable, practical judgment can
be made on TTCR, because TTCR is clearly a matter that is secondary to providing adequate
regional capacity of the regional highway system. After this current rush of TTCR/South Park
area analyses are complete, a truly comprehensive, coordinated, multi-agency assessment of the
improvements needed on WY22, The Y, Broadway, and US89 intersections/interchanges
through South Park should be done PRIOR to further TTCR project development. The resultant
set of regional roadway system improvements should inform and guide the TTCR project, not
the other way around!

               (these are not regional or even county-wide through routes)

LOCAL TRAFFIC VS THROUGH TRAFFIC

As shown on the attached Figure 3 from the HSRC/South Park Area Study draft report, only
about 33% of the traffic expected to use the TTCR as proposed would be Local traffic according
to the community's definition of through and local traffic. The other 67% is traffic that
can/should remain on the Regional/State road system.

Much of the discussion of TTCR impact and acceptability hinges on the terms "local traffic" and
"through traffic," and there seem to be multiple definitions of those terms, depending on who
one is talking to. In terms of the perspective of the TTCR/South Park area community, the terms
are defined as follows (using the traffic origin-destination information developed for the
HSRC/South Park area)

·   Traffic for which TTCR is needed - i.e., South Park/TTCR area neighborhood traffic enroute
    to/from WY22 that otherwise would have to travel out-of-direction to and via US89 ­ is the
    "community-defined" Local traffic, and the only traffic that TTCR should accommodate.
    (According to the draft traffic study, this local traffic comprises only 34% of TTCR traffic.

·   WY22 traffic enroute to/from areas east of Broadway should stay on WY22. It would be
    counterproductive and inappropriate to build TTCR in order to be able to divert this regional
    traffic off the state highway/arterial network and onto TTCR/South Park area neighborhood
    streets simply to avoid making the primary system improvements needed (e.g., at The Y).
    The 37% of potential TTCR traffic making this diversion constitutes a negative impact for
    the community, not a justification for the project.

·   WY22 traffic enroute to/from communities and businesses in the south end of South Park via
    US89 should continue to use WY22 and The Y. It would be counterproductive and
    inappropriate to build TTCR as a means of diverting this ostensibly local traffic (14% of
    potential TTCR traffic) onto TTCR/South Park area neighborhood streets simply as a means
    of short-cutting The Y and other State Hwy congestion points. (Cut-through traffic is
    undesirable and impacts neighborhoods regardless of whether the cut-through is inter-
    regional or from one part of the neighborhood to another...)

·   WY22 traffic enroute to/from US89 south of South Park (14% of potential TTCR traffic)
    clearly should remain on the regional highway system and should not use TTCR/South Park
    area neighborhood streets as a means of short-cutting The Y and other State Hwy congestion
    points.

As discussion proceeds and further study results become available, it becomes more and more
clear that advancing the TTCR at this time is premature. The Y is the key point in the
Town/County/State street/hwy system, and a comprehensive set of feasible improvements must
be identified and set in motion before TTCR can be properly considered.

SUBJECT:       High School Road Corridor Traffic Analysis
               Origin-Destination Study Results
               FHU Reference No. 09-076-01


This memorandum summarizes the results of the origin-destination study (O-D study) conducted
for the High School Road Corridor Traffic Analysis project. The O-D study was undertaken to
provide field data that quantifies the traffic volume that could potentially use the proposed Tribal
Trail Road extension to WY 22 west of town. This field data will be used in conjunction with Teton
County's travel demand forecasting model to project traffic volumes on that road in both the near
term and long term.

DATA COLLECTION

The O-D study was conducted on Tuesday, July 14, 2009 to capture typical mid-week conditions in
the summer. Based on Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT) data, July has the
highest average daily traffic volumes of the year, so the data collected represents conditions during
the peak travel period. The intent of the study was to quantify the traffic volumes traveling between
the west side (i.e., Teton Pass, Wilson and the Teton Village Road) and the north end of South
Park (local traffic); south South Park (also local traffic); and areas south of Jackson (through
traffic), so survey stations were set up at the following locations (Figure 1):

West Side
  · On WY 22 between the WY 22/WY 390 (Teton Village Road) intersection and the Snake
      River Bridge.

North End of South Park
   · On North South Park Loop Road west of the WY 89 intersection; and
   · On High School Road west of the WY 89 intersection;

South South Park
   · On Big Trail Drive west of the WY 89 intersection; and
   · On South Park Loop Road west of the WY 89 intersection

South of Jackson
   · On WY 89 south of the South Park Loop Road intersection

At each survey location two person teams recorded license plate numbers of vehicles travelling in
both directions on the roadway from 7 AM to 10 AM, 11 AM to 2 PM, and 3 PM to 7 PM to capture
travel data in both the morning and afternoon peak periods as well as the mid-day travel period.
To the best extent possible the surveyors recorded plate numbers for all of the vehicles on the road
during the nine hours of data collection so that the data set represented a significant portion of the
total daily traffic on each roadway.

Table 1 compares the number of license plates recorded at each survey station with the typical
total daily traffic (24-hour count) for that roadway, and indicates that in each case over half of the
total daily traffic was captured in the nine hour study period.

Unfortunately, because of the high traffic volumes at each station (particularly the West Side
station) it was not possible to collect data on the number of bicycle riders at each location, as had
been requested by Friends of Pathways.

Since the purpose of the study was to provide an assessment of potential travel on the Tribal Trail
Road extension, the plates at the west side location were matched up with plates at each of the
five south locations. Travel between any pair of south end sites was not recorded (e.g. between
South South Park Loop Road and High School Road), since those vehicles would not use the
proposed extension. Furthermore, plate matching was only conducted within each study time
period and not across time periods, so if, for example, a vehicle passed the west side site in the
morning and then a south end site in the mid day or evening, it would not have been matched,
since it was assumed that such traffic had an interim destination in town or north of town and
therefore would not shift to the Tribal Trail extension if it were provided.

STUDY RESULTS

Table 2 summarizes the overall study results and provides percentages related to the total daily
traffic on WY 22 on the west side of the Snake River. As the table indicates, approximately 5,000
vehicles (22 percent of the WY 22 traffic on the west side) has origins or destinations south of
town. Of that total, 12 percent is from the north end of South Park, four percent is from south
South Park, and six percent is through traffic from south of town.

The matched license plate data was also examined as it related to the total daily traffic volume at
each south end study location, as shown in Table 3. The results are similar to those in Table 2, but
show a slightly higher overall traffic volume forecast due to the variation in the percentage of plates
captured at each location. The most significant change was at the station on WY 89 south of South
Park Loop Road, which increased by 290 vehicles per day because a lower percentage of plates
were captured there than at the other locations. To present a more conservative scenario, the
slightly higher forecast of 5,350 vehicles per day (vpd) yielded by the methodology summarized in
Table 3 was selected as the base west-south traffic volume forecast.

Traffic Volume Adjustments

While the origin-destination survey included survey stations on all of the significant traffic volume
roadways in the South Park area, several of the lower volume roads and driveways immediately
north of South South Park Loop Road were omitted to help streamline the data collection process.
West-South traffic from that area was forecast based on the data collected at the other south end
stations, as shown in Table 4. For the two roads in that area that access primarily residential
property, the west-south traffic percentage was forecast based on the data from the Big Trail Drive
and South South Park Loop Road stations, which also access primarily residential property. For
the commercial driveways, the North South Park Loop Road and High School Road data was used
to forecast west-south travel, since the land uses in North South Park includes commercial
development. These percentages were then applied to the total daily traffic volumes for each
location to determine the west-south traffic forecast. Based on this methodology, approximately
800 vpd is forecast to travel between the west side and the roads and businesses that area, which
increases the total west-south traffic volume forecast to 6,150 vpd.

3. 2006 WYDOT Traffic Count. WYDOT counts in that year indicated that daily volumes on WY 89 south of
   SPLR were similar to the July 2008 count there, and volumes on SPLR were 150 vpd lower in 2008 than
   2006. Thus it was determined that the other 2006 counts would be reasonably representative of current
   conditions.

SUMMARY

Table 5 summarizes the overall traffic forecast for travel between the west side, South Park and
areas south of town and provides the percentage of traffic from each area relative to the total traffic
volume on WY 22 on the west side. As the table indicates, approximately 6,150 vehicles per day
travel between those areas, which represents 27 percent of the total daily traffic volume on WY 22
on the west side. Of that total, approximately 2,690 vpd (12 percent) is from the north end of South
Park, 1,710 vpd (seven percent) is from south South Park, and 1,710 (eight percent) is through
traffic from south of town.

It should be noted that the above volumes represent the total traffic travelling between the west
side and the south end that might potentially use the Tribal Trail Road extension, but it does not
represent an actual traffic forecast for that road. The traffic forecasts for Tribal Trail Road would be
a somewhat lower subset of this total, since it is anticipated that some drivers will continue to use
WY 89 and WY 22 even after the extension is complete. The traffic forecast for Tribal Trail Road is
the next task to be completed for this project, and will be conducted once the Teton County travel
demand model is updated with the current comprehensive plan land use data.

1.0        INTRODUCTION
This traffic analysis has been prepared to identify and evaluate the potential traffic impacts of the
proposed San Gabriel Hotel project. The project applicant seeks to obtain entitlements to
construct a hotel development at 221 West Valley Boulevard in the Valley Boulevard Specific
Plan area of the City of San Gabriel, California. The project site, which is located at the
northeast corner of the Palm Avenue/Valley Boulevard intersection, is bounded by Valley
Boulevard to the south, residential uses to the north, existing commercial development to the
east, and Palm Avenue to the west. The proposed project site location and general vicinity are
shown in Figure 1­1.

The traffic analysis follows City of San Gabriel traffic study guidelines 1 and is consistent with
traffic impact assessment guidelines set forth in the Los Angeles County Congestion
Management Program 2. This traffic analysis evaluates potential project-related impacts at seven
key intersections and two key study street segments in the vicinity of the project site. The study
intersections were determined in consultation with City of San Gabriel Department of
Community Development ­ Engineering Division staff. The Intersection Capacity Utilization
method was used to determine Volume-to-Capacity ratios and corresponding Levels of Service at
the six signalized study intersections, and the Highway Capacity Manual methodology as well as
the traffic signal warrant analysis was utilized for the stop-sign controlled study intersection. In
addition, a review was conducted of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
intersection and freeway monitoring stations to determine if a Congestion Management Program
transportation impact assessment analysis is required for the proposed project.

This study (i) presents existing traffic volumes, (ii) includes existing traffic volumes with the
forecast net new traffic volumes from the proposed project, (iii) recommends mitigation
measures, where necessary, (iv) forecasts future cumulative baseline traffic volumes, (v)
forecasts future traffic volumes with the proposed project, (vi) determines future forecast with
project-related impacts, and (vii) recommends mitigation measures, where necessary.

1.1        Study Area
Upon coordination with City of San Gabriel staff, a total of nine locations, including seven study
intersections and two street segments have been identified for evaluation. These study locations
provide local access to the study area and define the extent of the boundaries for this traffic
impact investigation. Further discussion of the existing street system and study area is provided
in Section 5.0 herein.

The general location of the project in relation to the study locations and surrounding street
system is presented in Figure 1­1. The traffic analysis study area is generally comprised of
those locations which have the greatest potential to experience significant traffic impacts due to
the proposed project as defined by the Lead Agency. In the traffic engineering practice, the
study area generally includes those intersections that are:

           a.         Immediately adjacent or in close proximity to the project site;

           b.         In the vicinity of the project site that are documented to have current or projected
                      future adverse operational issues; and

           c.         In the vicinity of the project site that are forecast to experience a relatively greater
                      percentage of project-related vehicular turning movements (e.g., at freeway ramp
                      intersections).

The locations selected for analysis were based on the above criteria, proposed San Gabriel Hotel
project peak hour vehicle trip generation, the anticipated distribution of project vehicular trips
and existing intersection/corridor operations. Traffic analysis study areas are validated when no
significant traffic impacts are expected to occur at the periphery or outlying boundary. If a
significant traffic impact is determined on the periphery of analysis study area, then in order to
comply with the CEQA requirements regarding full disclosure of potential impacts, study
locations should be added until such point that the analysis indicates no significant traffic impact.

2.0        PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1        Site Location
The proposed development project is located at 221 West Valley Boulevard, just east of Palm
Avenue in the City of San Gabriel, California. The proposed project is located in the Valley
Boulevard Specific Plan area of the City of San Gabriel. The project site, which is located at the
northeast corner of the Palm Avenue/Valley Boulevard intersection, is bounded by Valley
Boulevard to the south, residential uses to the north, existing commercial development to the
east, and Palm Avenue to the west. The proposed project site and general vicinity are shown in
Figure 1­1.

2.2        Existing Project Site
The existing semi-rectangular project site is currently occupied by a sporting goods store of
approximately 6,936 square feet and a real estate office totaling 4,492 square feet of building
floor area. The project site also includes the old West San Gabriel Valley auditorium building
and a former single family residential unit that is currently used for storage as part of the existing
site. The primary parking areas for the existing site are located along Valley Boulevard, Palm
Avenue, and the on-site surface parking areas located behind (i.e., north of) the buildings. The
existing building and surface parking areas will be removed in order to accommodate the
proposed project.

2.3        Proposed Project Description
The project applicant seeks to obtain entitlements to construct the proposed San Gabriel Hotel
project consisting of the development of a five-story hotel project with approximately 316
rooms. Three restaurants and a lobby bar area totaling approximately 11,416 square feet will be
provided on the ground floor along the southerly portion of the site, mainly fronting Valley
Boulevard. Other ancillary uses will include retail space for sundry shops as well as ballrooms
and meeting rooms within the hotel building. Completion and utilization of the proposed project
is planned to occur in the year 2015. The site plan for the proposed San Gabriel Hotel project is
illustrated in Figure 2­1.

The proposed project is planned to provide a total of approximately 500 parking spaces with 399
spaces in the subterranean parking levels, 32 spaces on the ground level, and 69 spaces in the
mezzanine levels. Vehicular access to the proposed project is planned to be provided via one
main access point on Palm Avenue which serves the porte-cochere area, approximately mid-way
along the westerly property frontage. Further discussion of the project's planned site access and
circulation scheme is provided in Section 3.0.

3.0        SITE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION
The proposed site access scheme for the San Gabriel Hotel project is displayed in Figure 2­1. A
description of the proposed site access and circulation scheme is provided in the following
subsections.

3.1        Proposed Project Site Access
Access to the project site is planned to be provided via two driveways on Palm Avenue: a main
access driveway and a service/delivery driveway. No direct vehicular site access for the project
will be provided via Valley Boulevard. A supplemental vehicle queuing analysis of the
southbound Palm Avenue approach north of Valley Boulevard is contained in Section 11.0.
Descriptions of the planned project site access points are provided in the following paragraphs.

           ·    Palm Avenue Main Driveway

           This project access point will be located along the east side of Palm Avenue, north of
           Valley Boulevard, approximately mid-way along the westerly property frontage. Right-
           turn ingress and left-turn egress turning movements to and from the project site will be
           accommodated at this project site access point. This site access and circulation scheme
           will be reinforced with appropriate signing and directions/maps to be contained on the
           hotel's website. The Palm Avenue main driveway will provide access to the porte-
           cochere area for the entry drop-off/pick-up as well as provide a turnaround area for
           potential use by shuttle buses. A raised landscaped median island will separate the
           inbound and outbound drive aisles for this access point. The surface parking lot and
           ramp leading down to the subterranean level parking as well as the ramp leading up to the
           mezzanine level parking will be directly accessed via the Palm Avenue main driveway.
           The proposed Palm Avenue main driveway will be constructed to City of San Gabriel
           design standards.

           ·    Service/Delivery Driveway

           The service and delivery activities for the site will be accommodated via a driveway
           located along the east side of Palm Avenue, at the northwest corner of the project site and
           north of the main access point. The service/delivery driveway will provide access to the
           loading area. Right-turn ingress and left-turn egress turning movements to and from the
           project site will be accommodated at this project site driveway. This site access and
           circulation scheme will be reinforced with all vendors servicing the hotel and via
           appropriate signing and directions/maps to be contained on the hotel's website. The
           proposed service and delivery driveway will be constructed to City of San Gabriel design
           standards.

3.2        Pedestrian Access
The project has been designed to encourage pedestrian activity and walking as a transportation
mode 3. As indicated in Figure 2­1, walkways and plaza areas are planned within the proposed
project which will connect to adjacent sidewalks in a manner that promotes walkability.
Walkability is a term for the extent to which walking is readily available as a safe, connected,
accessible and pleasant mode of transport. There are several criteria that are widely accepted as
key aspects of the walkability of urban areas that should be satisfied. The underlying principle is
that pedestrians should not be delayed, diverted, or placed in danger. The widely accepted
characteristics of walkability are as follows:

·     Connectivity: People can walk from one place to another without encountering major
      obstacles, obstructions, or loss of connectivity.

·     Convivial: Pedestrian routes are friendly and attractive, and are perceived as such by
      pedestrians.

·     Conspicuous: Suitable levels of lighting, visibility and surveillance over its entire length,
      with high quality delineation and signage.

·     Comfortable: High quality and well-maintained footpaths of suitable widths, attractive
      landscaping and architecture, shelter and rest spaces, and a suitable allocation of roadspace to
      pedestrians.

·     Convenient: Walking is a realistic travel choice, partly because of the impact of the other
      criteria set forth above, but also because walking routes are of a suitable length as a result of
      land use planning with minimal delays.

A review of the proposed project pedestrian walkway network indicates that these five primary
characteristics are accommodated as part of the proposed project. The interior of the project is
planned to provide a combination of landscape and hardscape that facilitates internal
accessibility as well as connectivity to a broad range of uses beyond its boundaries. The project
is situated adjacent to and accessible from nearby commercial uses (e.g., retail, coffee cafes,
restaurants, etc.) and other amenities along the Valley Boulevard corridor, as well as nearby
public bus transit stops. The pedestrian walkways within the site and the adjacent sidewalks will
be appropriately landscaped and designed to provide a friendly walking environment.
Additionally, the walkways will be well lit and include appropriate wayfinding signage.

  For example, refer to http://www.walkscore.com/, which generates a walkability score of approximately 82 (Very
Walkable) out of 100 for the project site. Walk Score calculates the walkability of an address by locating nearby
stores, restaurants, schools, parks, etc. Walk Score measures how easy it is to live a car-lite lifestyle--not how pretty
the area is for walking.

3.3        Review of Roadway Classifications and Standards
Provisions in the Municipal Code require the City to consider half-street dedications and
improvements for roadways adjacent to development sites in accordance with adopted standards.
The project site is adjacent to Valley Boulevard to the south and Palm Avenue to the west.

3.3.1 Existing Conditions
Pursuant to the review of an ALTA survey and confirmed with the City's right-of-way map for
the project site, an existing half roadway width of 38 feet and a half right-of-way width of 50 feet
currently exists along the Valley Boulevard project frontage. An existing half roadway width of
17 feet and a half right-of-way width of 25 feet currently exist along the Palm Avenue project
frontage. The review of the adopted standards including the Valley Boulevard Neighborhoods
Sustainability Plan, the Mobility Element in the City's Comprehensive General Plan, and the
Municipal Code Design Standards for Valley Boulevard and Palm Avenue are discussed further
below.

3.3.2 Valley Boulevard Review
Comprehensive General Plan - As part of the City's Long Range Transportation Improvements,
Valley Boulevard is designated as a 6-Lane Arterial (6LA) in the functional classification system
of the Mobility Element of the General Plan. The standard cross-section range for a 6-Lane
Arterial is an 82 - 88-foot roadway on a 100 - 112-foot right-of-way (or a 41 - 44-foot half
roadway on a 50 - 56-foot half right-of-way as measured from the roadway centerline).
According to the General Plan, a roadway widening range of between three and six feet (3'-6')
and a roadway dedication of up to six feet (6') adjacent to the project site could be required by
the City in order to comply with the 6-Lane Arterial half-street standard.
Valley Boulevard Neighborhoods Sustainability Plan - A major component of the Valley
Boulevard Neighborhoods Sustainability Plan was to develop a "sustainable transportation
system that facilitates mobility for residents, visitors, shoppers and workers in the Valley
Boulevard Neighborhoods." As part of the mandatory regulations intended to support the
sustainable transportation policy, the standard cross section for Valley Boulevard is identified as
a five-lane street and will also include: 1) center turn lane/landscaped pocket medians; 2) parallel
parking that may be converted to peak-period travel lane; and 3) sidewalks. Parallel curb
parking and sidewalk widths will be maintained and expanded where possible. The section of
Valley Boulevard along the project frontage currently meets the sustainability transportation
standards (i.e., provides the five-lane street with curb parking and existing 12-foot wide
sidewalks) identified in the Valley Boulevard Neighborhoods Sustainability Plan. Based on
coordination with the City of San Gabriel Community Development Department Engineering
Division staff, it is anticipated that widening of the Valley Boulevard right-of-way will not be
required for this project. However, the City has stated that there could be minor widening and/or
narrowing at specific locations to provide bulb outs or turn outs or the like, but this will not be
determined until designs of the street improvement plans for Valley Boulevard and Palm Avenue
are prepared.

3.3.3 Palm Avenue Review
Municipal Code Design Standards - As part of the City's Design Standards outlined in the
Chapter 16.24.090 of the Municipal Code, the standard cross-section for a Local Street is a 40-
foot roadway on a 60-foot right-of-way (or a 20-foot half roadway on a 30-foot half right of-way
as measured from the centerline). Based on coordination with the City of San Gabriel
Community Development Department Engineering Division staff, it is anticipated that widening
of the Palm Avenue right-of-way will not be required for this project. However, the City has
stated that there could be minor widening and/or narrowing at specific locations to provide bulb
outs or turn outs or the like, but this will not be determined until designs of the street
improvement plans for Valley Boulevard and Palm Avenue are prepared.

4.0        PROJECT PARKING
For informational purposes only, Section 4.1 summarizes the review of the project's parking
requirements according to the previous City of San Gabriel Municipal Code requirements which
have been superseded based on the Valley Boulevard Neighborhoods Sustainability Plan
(VBNSP), amended on January 15, 2013. Based on the amended VBNSP, parking for the site
shall be determined based on a parking demand study as part of the entitlement application. As
such, a shared parking analysis has been prepared and is summarized in Section 4.3 below to
account for the changes in parking demand that occur based on time of day as well as day of the
week (e.g., during the weekday versus weekend conditions) for the various types of land use
components proposed for the project.

4.1        Previous City Code Parking Requirements
The City of San Gabriel requirements for various individual land uses are set forth in Section
153.220 of the Municipal Zoning Code. In accordance with previous City of San Gabriel
Municipal Code parking requirements, a total of 563 parking spaces would have been required
for the proposed San Gabriel Hotel project as shown in the following calculations:

      ·    Hotel: 316 rooms × 1.0 space/room + 2 spaces = 318 spaces

      ·    Restaurant Space: 9,005 GSF x 10.0 spaces/1,000 GSF = 90 spaces

      ·    Lobby Bar Space: 2,411 GSF x 1.0 space/150 GSF = 16 spaces

      ·    Kitchen Space: 4,200 GSF x 5.0 spaces/1,000 GSF = 21 spaces

      ·    Retail Space: 965 GSF x 4.0 spaces/1,000 GSF = 4 spaces

      ·    Business Center Space: 1,180 GSF x 4.0 spaces/1,000 GSF = 5 spaces

      ·    Ballroom/Meeting Room Space: 10,895 GSF x 10.0 spaces/1,000 GSF = 109 spaces

      ·    Total Previous City Code Required Project Parking = 563 spaces

4.2        Proposed Project Parking Supply
A total of 500 parking spaces are planned to be provided within the project site, including 399
spaces in two subterranean parking levels, 32 spaces at grade level, and 69 spaces in the two
mezzanine parking levels. The previous City of San Gabriel Code parking requirement for the
San Gabriel Hotel project totals 563 spaces. Thus, the project parking supply of 500 spaces
would have been 63 spaces less than the previous Code parking requirement. However, with the
adopting of the VBNSP amendment, the appropriate parking supply is determined based on a

As part of the parking supply, the project must also provide a minimum of nine handicap
accessible spaces. This complies with the American With Disabilities Act requirement of a
minimum of nine spaces of the on-site parking supply as accessible spaces for parking facilities
with 401 to 500 spaces, with one in every six handicap spaces being van accessible.

4.3        Shared Parking Demand Analysis
The concept of shared parking is widely recognized within the transportation planning industry
and accounts for the changes in parking demand over time for different types of land uses within
a project. Furthermore, accumulated experience in parking demand characteristics indicates that
a mixing of land uses (i.e., hotels and restaurants) results in an overall parking need that is less
than the sum of the individual peak requirements for each land use. Due to the proposed multi-
use characteristics of the San Gabriel Hotel project, opportunities to share parking can be
expected.

This shared parking analysis, as required by the VBNSP, has been prepared based on data
contained in the second edition of the Shared Parking manual 4 published by the Urban Land
Institute (ULI) in order to determine if there will be a sufficient number of parking spaces to
adequately accommodate the future peak parking demand of the project in combination with full
occupancy of the restaurant tenant spaces proposed as part of the project. The Shared Parking
manual provides recommendations with respect to the following characteristics of parking
demand:

      ·    Hourly Parking Indices. The Shared Parking manual provides hourly parking indices for
           various land uses. For the proposed hotel use, the hourly parking indices for leisure
           hotel, including separate conference center/banquet space and restaurant/lounge areas
           were utilized. The indices show, for example, that the hourly parking demand for
           restaurants (which generates its peak parking demand concentrated around the mid-day
           lunch hour) is different than the parking demand associated with hotels (which generate
           its peak parking demand concentrated around the late evening periods). Thus, under the
           shared parking principle, a parking space that is used in the daytime by a patron of the
           restaurant component could be used again in the evening by a guest of the hotel.

      ·    Day of Week Parking Variations.           The Shared Parking manual provides
           recommendations for day of week parking factors. For example, leisure hotel uses
           experience their peak parking demands during weekends and experience lower parking
           demand during weekdays.

     ·     Monthly Parking Variations. The Shared Parking manual considers that some uses have
           substantial parking variations based on the month of the year. Retail uses, for example,
           typically generate their highest parking demand in December while restaurant and hotel
           uses have a generally consistent parking demand throughout the year.

Based on the previous City's Code parking requirements, the base parking ratio (i.e., peak
parking ratio unadjusted) of 1.0 space per room (plus 2 spaces for managers) was applied to the
316 hotel rooms. The restaurant/lounge parking ratio of 10.0 spaces per 1,000 square feet of
gross floor area was applied to the restaurants and lobby bar space and the conference
center/banquet space parking ratio of 10.0 spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area was
applied to the meeting rooms and ballroom space. It should be noted that the remaining space
(i.e., kitchen, retail, business center) are ancillary uses to the hotel. Direct application of these
peak parking demand ratios yields an unadjusted base parking demand of 541 spaces (318 spaces
for the hotel peak condition [i.e., weekend], 114 spaces for the restaurant peak condition [i.e.,
weekday and weekend], and 109 spaces for the conference center/banquet space [i.e., weekday
and weekend]). However, the restaurant uses in the hotel are expected to generate a significant
degree of internal capture from the hotel guests as well as walk-in patronage from surrounding
uses in the area including other nearby retail and residential uses. Therefore, a 50 percent walk-
in adjustment factor was applied to the proposed restaurant use, resulting in an adjusted peak
parking demand of 57 spaces (weekday and weekend) for the restaurant component. The total
adjusted parking demand for the San Gabriel Hotel project combined is estimated to be 484
spaces (318 spaces for the hotel, 57 spaces for the restaurant and 109 spaces for the conference
center/banquet space) without accounting for the variations in demand that occur based on the
time of day and/or the day of week.

In order to determine the peak parking requirement for the proposed San Gabriel Hotel project,
the shared parking demand model for the proposed hotel (including the restaurants and
ballroom/meeting room space) was developed. The ULI parking rates and the ULI hourly
parking accumulation profiles for the proposed hotel, including the restaurants and meeting
room/banquet space, were applied to determine the forecast shared parking demand for the
project. The weekday and weekend parking analyses utilizing the Shared Parking methodology
for the proposed San Gabriel Hotel project with full occupancy of the restaurant tenant space are
summarized in Tables 3­1 and 3­2, respectively. Appendix A contains the weekday and
weekend day shared parking demand analysis calculation worksheets for the individual project
land use components (i.e., hotel, restaurant/lounge, meeting room/banquet space). The weekday
and weekend shared parking demand breakdown between the hotel guests and hotel employees
are also shown in Appendix A.

When accounting for shared parking usage between the proposed hotel, restaurants and meeting
rooms and banquet space, a peak weekday parking demand of 391 spaces (78.2% utilization of
the combined total of 500 spaces) is forecast to occur at 9:00 PM as shown in Table 3­1. Also, it
is noted in Appendix A (refer to Appendix Table A-1) that the peak weekday demand of 391
spaces breakdowns to comprise 231 spaces for hotel guests, 13 spaces for hotel employees, 38

     [2] The proposed project includes 316 hotel rooms, and a total of 11,416 square feet for the restaurants, and 10,895 square feet of
     ballroom and meeting room space.

     [3] Parking rates based on the Code parking ratios of 1.0 space per room (plus two spaces for managers) for the hotel use, and
     10.0 spaces per 1,000 square feet of floor area for the restaurant/lounge and conference center/banquet space.

     [4] Weekend parking rates reflect relationships between the weekend parking demand ratios and the peak parking demand
     ratios, as summarized in Table 2-2 of the "Shared Parking" manual.

     [5] Gross spaces for the restaurant component adjusted by 50% to reflect parking demand reduction due to captive market,
     internal capture, transit, and/or walk-in reduction.

spaces for the restaurant space, and 109 spaces for the conference center/banquet space. The
weekend peak shared parking demand for the project is forecast to be greater than the weekday
conditions. As shown in Table 3­2, a peak parking demand of 430 spaces (86.0% utilization of
the combined total of 500 spaces) is forecast to occur also at 9:00 PM during a weekend day
condition for the various project components (i.e., hotel with meeting room/banquet space and
restaurant uses). Also, it is noted in Appendix A (refer to Appendix Table A-2) that the peak
weekend demand of 430 spaces breakdowns to comprise of 256 spaces for hotel guests, 27
spaces for hotel employees, 38 spaces for the restaurant space, and 109 spaces for the conference
center/banquet space. As a result, the overall peak shared parking demand for the San Gabriel
Hotel project is forecast to total 430 parking spaces. It should be noted that the overall peak
shared parking demand also accounts for usage of the conference center/banquet space during
the evening hours (i.e., special events, etc.). Consequently, given the review of the shared
parking demand analysis and comparisons with the parking supply, it can be concluded that a
surplus of 109 parking spaces is forecast to occur during peak weekday condition and a surplus
of 70 parking spaces is forecast to occur during the peak weekend condition.

During times when the parking demand is high at the project site, effective parking management
strategies may address any potential peak parking demands as well as accomplish a number of
outcomes consistent with the Valley Boulevard Neighborhoods Sustainability Plan, including:

     ·     Implementation of managed parking for some spaces within the hotel building (i.e., both
           the valet parking spaces and the tandem parking spaces) would increase the effective
           parking supply as valet attended parking could occur within drive aisles located
           throughout the hotel parking areas;

     ·     Implementation of managed parking would ensure that on-site parking is always
           available for hotel guests and visitors;

     ·     With an increase in the effective hotel parking supply through managed parking, shared
           parking opportunities for third parties would be possible during weekday and weekend
           morning hours; and

     ·     Effective management of the hotel parking facilities contributes to good urban design and
           sustainability.

5.0        EXISTING STREET SYSTEM
5.1        Regional Highway System
Regional access to the project site is provided by Interstate 10 (San Bernardino) Freeway, as
shown in Figure 1­1. I-10 (San Bernardino) Freeway is a major east-west oriented freeway that
extends from the City of Santa Monica in the west to San Bernardino in the east within the State
of California. In the project vicinity, four mainline travel lanes and one High Occupancy
Vehicle travel lane are provided in each direction. Full freeway interchanges (i.e., eastbound and
westbound on and off-ramps) are provided at New Avenue, Del Mar Avenue, and San Gabriel
Boulevard, south of Valley Boulevard.

5.2        Study Intersections
Immediate access to the project site is provided via Valley Boulevard and Palm Avenue. The
following seven study intersections were selected for analysis in consultation with City staff in
order to determine potential impacts related to the proposed project:

           1. New Avenue/Valley Boulevard.

           2. Del Mar Avenue/Mission Road-El Monte Street.

           3. Del Mar Avenue/Valley Boulevard.

           4. Del Mar Avenue/I-10 Freeway Westbound (WB) Ramps and Eastbound (EB)
              Carpool Ramp.

           5. Palm Avenue (north leg)/Valley Boulevard.

           6. San Gabriel Boulevard/Valley Boulevard.

           7. Walnut Grove Avenue/Valley Boulevard.

Six of the study intersections are presently controlled by traffic signals while the remaining study
intersection (No. 5, Palm Avenue [north leg]/Valley Boulevard) is currently stop-sign controlled
with the stop sign facing the minor street approach (i.e., Palm Avenue). The existing lane
configurations at the seven study intersections are displayed in Figure 5­1.

5.3        Study Street Segments
The following two study street segment locations were identified for analysis in consultation
with City staff for inclusion in the neighborhood residential street segment analysis:

           1. Newby Avenue between Del Mar Avenue and Palm Avenue.

           2. Palm Avenue (north leg) between Valley Boulevard and Newby Avenue.

5.4        Roadway Classifications
The City of San Gabriel utilizes the roadway categories recognized by regional, state and federal
transportation agencies. There are four categories in the roadway hierarchy, ranging from
freeways with the highest capacity to two-lane undivided roadways with the lowest capacity.
The roadway categories are summarized as follows:

·     Freeways are limited-access and high speed travel ways included in the state and federal
      highway systems. Their purpose is to carry regional through-traffic. Access is provided by
      interchanges with typical spacing of one mile or greater. No local access is provided to
      adjacent land uses.

·     Arterial roadways are major streets that primarily serve through-traffic and provide access to
      abutting properties as a secondary function. Arterials are generally designed with two to six
      travel lanes and their major intersections are signalized. This roadway type is divided into
      two categories: principal and minor arterials. Principal arterials are typically four-or-more
      lane roadways and serve both local and regional through-traffic. Minor arterials are typically
      two-to-four lane streets that service local and commute traffic.

·     Collector roadways are streets that provide access and traffic circulation within residential
      and non-residential (e.g., commercial and industrial) areas. Collector roadways connect local
      streets to arterials and are typically designed with two through travel lanes (i.e., one through
      travel lane in each direction) that may accommodate on-street parking. They may also
      provide access to abutting properties.

·     Local roadways distribute traffic within a neighborhood, or similar adjacent neighborhoods,
      and are not intended for use as a through-street or a link between higher capacity facilities
      such as collector or arterial roadways. Local streets are fronted by residential uses and do not
      typically serve commercial uses.

5.5        Roadway Descriptions
Brief descriptions of the important roadways in the project site vicinity are provided in the
following paragraphs.

New Avenue is a north-south oriented roadway that is located west of the project site. New
Avenue is classified as a 4-Lane Street (4LS) from Ramona Street to Valley Boulevard and a 4-
Lane Arterial (4LA) from Valley Boulevard to I-10 Freeway in the City's General Plan Mobility
Element (May 2004). Two through travel lanes are provided in each direction in the project
study area. Exclusive left-turn lanes are provided in both directions at the Valley Boulevard
intersection. New Avenue is posted for a speed limit of 30 to 35 miles per hour, north and south
of Valley Boulevard, respectively.

Del Mar Avenue is a north-south oriented roadway that is located one block west of the project
site. Del Mar Avenue is classified as a Limited Secondary Arterial (LSA) from Longden Drive

to Broadway and a 4-Lane Arterial (4LA) from Broadway to I-10 Freeway in the City's General
Plan Mobility Element (May 2004). One to two through travel lanes are provided in each
direction in the project study area. Exclusive left-turn lanes are provided in the both directions at
the Mission Road and Valley Boulevard intersections. Del Mar Avenue is posted for a speed
limit of 35 and 30 miles per hour, north and south of Valley Boulevard, respectively.

Palm Avenue is a north-south oriented discontinuous roadway that borders the project site to the
west. Palm Avenue is a local street that provides one through travel lane in each direction in the
project vicinity. The segment of Palm Avenue south of Valley Boulevard is approximately 140
feet east of the segment of Palm Avenue north of Valley Boulevard. There is no posted speed
limit on Palm Avenue in the project vicinity, thus it is assumed to be a prima facie speed limit of
25 miles per hour.

San Gabriel Boulevard is a north-south oriented roadway that is located east of the project site.
San Gabriel Boulevard is classified as a 4-Lane Boulevard (4LB) from the northerly City
boundary to Las Tunas Drive where it transitions to a 6-Lane Boulevard (6LB) to the I-10
Freeway in the City's General Plan Mobility Element (May 2004). San Gabriel Boulevard is
also one of the designated truck routes in the City. Two through travel lanes are provided in
each direction in the project study area. Exclusive left-turn lanes are provided in the both
directions at the Valley Boulevard intersection. San Gabriel Boulevard is posted for a speed
limit of 35 miles per hour in the project study area.

Walnut Grove Avenue is a north-south oriented roadway that is located east of the project site.
Walnut Grove Avenue is classified as a Minor Arterial in the City of Rosemead's General Plan
Update (February 2010). Two through travel lanes are provided in each direction in the project
study area. Exclusive left-turn lanes are provided in the both directions at the Valley Boulevard
intersection. Walnut Grove Avenue is posted for a speed limit of 40 miles per hour in the project
study area.

Mission Road is an east-west oriented roadway that is located north of the project site. Mission
Road is classified as a 4-Lane Arterial (4LA) between the easterly City boundary to Junipero
Serra Drive and a Limited Secondary Street (LSS) between Junipero Serra Drive and the
westerly City boundary. Mission Road is also one of the designated truck routes in the City.
One through travel lane is provided in each direction on Mission Road north of the site. Mission
Road is posted for a speed limit of 30 miles per hour in the project study area.

Valley Boulevard is an east-west oriented roadway that borders the project site to the south.
Valley Boulevard is classified as a 6-Lane Arterial (6LA) in the City's General Plan Mobility
Element (May 2004). Valley Boulevard is also one of the designated truck routes in the City.
Two through travel lanes are provided in each direction in the project study area. Exclusive left-
turn lanes are provided in both directions at major intersections in the project vicinity. Valley
Boulevard is posted for a speed limit of 35 miles per hour in the project study area.

6.0        TRAFFIC COUNTS
6.1        Manual Intersection Traffic Counts
New manual counts of vehicular turning movements were conducted at each of the study
intersections during the weekday morning (AM) and afternoon (PM) commuter periods, as well
as the Saturday mid-day peak period, to determine the peak hour traffic volumes. The manual
traffic counts at the study intersections were conducted by a traffic count subconsultant from
7:00 AM to 9:00 AM to determine the weekday AM peak commuter hour, from 4:00 PM to 6:00
PM to determine the weekday PM peak commuter hour, and from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM to
determine the Saturday mid-day peak hour. Traffic volumes at the study intersections show the
typical weekday peak periods from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM generally
associated with the peak morning and afternoon commuter time periods.

The weekday AM and PM peak period manual counts of vehicle movements at the study
intersections are summarized in Table 6­1. The existing traffic volumes at the study
intersections during the weekday AM and PM peak hours are shown in Figures 6­1 and 6­2,
respectively. Summary data worksheets of the weekday manual traffic counts at the study
intersections are contained in Appendix B.

The Saturday mid-day peak period manual counts of vehicle movements at the study
intersections included in the weekend analysis are also summarized in Table 6­1. The existing
traffic volumes at these study intersections during the Saturday mid-day peak hour are shown in
Figure 6­3. Summary data worksheets of the Saturday manual traffic counts at the study
intersections also are contained in Appendix B.

6.2        Automatic 24-Hour Machine Traffic Counts
Automatic 24-hour machine traffic counts of the two study street segments were conducted by a
traffic count subconsultant during two mid-week days and one weekend day (Saturday) in
January 2012. Copies of the current 24-hour machine traffic counts for the study street segment
locations are also contained in Appendix B.

7.0        CUMULATIVE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
The forecast of future pre-project conditions was prepared in accordance with procedures
outlined in Section 15130 of the CEQA Guidelines. Specifically, the CEQA Guidelines provides
two options for developing the future traffic volume forecast:

           "(A) A list of past, present, and probable future projects producing related or
           cumulative impacts, including, if necessary, those projects outside the control of
           the [lead] agency, or

           (B) A summary of projections contained in an adopted local, regional or statewide
           plan, or related planning document, that describes or evaluates conditions
           contributing to the cumulative effect. Such plans may include: a general plan,
           regional transportation plan, or plans for the reduction of greenhouse gas
           emissions. A summary of projections may also be contained in an adopted or
           certified prior environmental document for such a plan. Such projections may be
           supplemented with additional information such as a regional modeling program.
           Any such document shall be referenced and made available to the public at a
           location specified by the lead agency."

Accordingly, the traffic analysis provides a highly conservative estimate of future pre-project
traffic volumes as it incorporates both the "A" and "B" options outlined in the CEQA Guidelines
for purposes of developing the forecast.

7.1        Related Projects
A forecast of on-street traffic conditions prior to occupancy of the proposed project was prepared
by incorporating the potential trips associated with other known development projects (related
projects) in the area. With this information, the potential impact of the proposed project can be
evaluated within the context of the cumulative impact of all ongoing development. The list of
related projects was based on information on file at the City of San Gabriel Department of
Planning. The list of related projects in the project site area is presented in Table 7­1. The
location of the related projects is shown in Figure 7­1.

Traffic volumes expected to be generated by the related projects were calculated using rates
provided in the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation Manual 5. The
related projects' respective traffic generation for the weekday AM and PM peak hours, as well as
on a daily basis for a typical weekday, is also summarized in Table 7­1. The anticipated
distribution of the related projects traffic volumes to the study intersections during the weekday
AM and PM peak hours is displayed in Figures 7­2 and 7­3, respectively. The related projects'
respective Saturday traffic generation for the mid-day peak hour, as well as on a daily basis, also

the study intersections during the Saturday mid-day peak hour is displayed in Figure 7­4.

7.2        Ambient Traffic Growth
In order to account for area-wide regional growth not included in this analysis, the existing
traffic volumes were increased at an annual rate of one percent (1.0%) to the year 2015 (i.e., the
anticipated year of project build-out). The ambient growth factor was based on general traffic
growth factors provided in the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County
(the "CMP manual") and determined in consultation with City staff. It is noted that based on
review of the general traffic growth factors provided in the CMP manual for the San Gabriel
Valley area, it is anticipated that the existing traffic volumes are expected to increase at an
annual rate of less than 1.0% per year between the years 2010 and 2015. Thus, application of
this annual growth factor allows for a conservative, worst case forecast of future traffic volumes
in the area. Further, it is noted that the CMP manual's traffic growth rate is intended to
anticipate future traffic generated by development projects in the project vicinity. Thus, the
inclusion in this traffic analysis of both a forecast of traffic generated by known related projects
plus the use of an ambient growth traffic factor based on CMP traffic model data results in a
conservative estimate of future traffic volumes at the study intersections.

8.0        TRAFFIC FORECASTING METHODOLOGY
In order to estimate the traffic impact characteristics of the San Gabriel Hotel project, a
multi-step process has been utilized. The first step is trip generation, which estimates the total
arriving and departing traffic volumes on a peak hour and daily basis. The traffic generation
potential is forecast by applying the appropriate vehicle trip generation equations or rates to the
project development tabulation.

The second step of the forecasting process is trip distribution, which identifies the origins and
destinations of inbound and outbound project traffic volumes. These origins and destinations are
typically based on demographics and existing/anticipated travel patterns in the study area.

The third step is traffic assignment, which involves the allocation of project traffic to study area
streets and intersections. Traffic assignment is typically based on minimization of travel time,
which may or may not involve the shortest route, depending on prevailing operating conditions
and travel speeds. Traffic distribution patterns are indicated by general percentage orientation,
while traffic assignment allocates specific volume forecasts to individual roadway links and
intersection turning movements throughout the study area.

With the forecasting process complete and project traffic assignments developed, the impact of
the proposed project is isolated by comparing operational (i.e., Levels of Service) conditions at
the selected key intersections using existing and expected future traffic volumes with and
without forecast project traffic. The need for site-specific and/or cumulative local area traffic
improvements can then be evaluated and the significance of the project's impacts identified.

8.1        Project Traffic Generation
Traffic generation is expressed in vehicle trip ends, defined as one-way vehicular movements,
either entering or exiting the generating land use. Traffic volumes expected to be generated by
the proposed project during the weekday AM and PM peak hours and Saturday mid-day peak
hour, as well as on a daily basis for a weekday and a Saturday, were estimated using rates
published in the ITE Trip Generation Manual. Traffic volumes expected to be generated by the
proposed project were based upon rates per number of rooms for the hotel land use component
and per thousand square feet of building floor area for the restaurant component. ITE Land Use
Code 310 (Hotel) trip generation average rates were used to forecast the traffic volumes expected
to be generated by the hotel land use. ITE Land Use Codes 931 (Quality Restaurant) and 932
(High-Turnover [Sit-Down] Restaurant) trip generation average rates were used to forecast the
traffic volumes expected to be generated by the various types of restaurant use.

In addition to the trip generation forecasts for the project land use components (which are
essentially an estimate of the number of vehicles that could be expected to enter and exit the site
access points), a forecast was made of likely internal capture trips. Internal capture trips are
those trips made internal to the site between land uses in a mixed or multi-use development.
When combined within a mixed or multi-use development, land uses tend to interact, and thus

                                                                                        San Gabriel Hotel Project

attract a portion of each other's trip generation. Accordingly, a 50 percent (50%) internal
capture adjustment has been applied only to the restaurant land use components for the proposed
project to account for the synergistic effects of the planned land use mix.

Traffic volumes to be generated by the existing project site uses were also forecast for the
weekday AM and PM peak hours and Saturday mid-day peak hour, as well as on a daily basis for
a weekday and a Saturday, using rates published in the ITE Trip Generation Manual. The
following ITE trip rates were used to forecast traffic volumes for the existing uses that comprise
the project site: ITE Land Use Code 820 Shopping Center (Jeff's Sporting Goods); and ITE Land
Use Code 710 General Office Building (Real Estate Office).

In addition to the trip generation forecasts for the existing site retail land use (which are
essentially an estimate of the number of vehicles that could be expected to enter and exit the site
access points), a forecast was made of likely pass-by trips. Pass-by trips are made as intermediate
stops on the way from an origin to a primary destination without a route diversion. Pass-by trips
are attracted from traffic passing the site on an adjacent street or roadway that offers direct
access to the site. In this instance, the adjacent roadway to the existing project site includes
Valley Boulevard. Accordingly, a 20 percent (20%) pass-by trip reduction adjustment was
applied only to the existing site retail land use component (i.e., Jeff's Sporting Goods). In
addition, it is noted that no pass-by trip adjustment has been applied to the ancillary restaurant
land use planned as part of the proposed San Gabriel Hotel project in order to provide a
conservative project trip generation forecast.

8.1.1 Weekday Project Trip Generation Summary
The trip generation rates and forecast of the vehicular trips anticipated to be generated by the
proposed project are presented in Table 8­1. The project trip generation forecast was submitted
for review and approval by City staff. As summarized in Table 8­1, the proposed San Gabriel
Hotel project is expected to generate a net increase of 202 vehicle trips (116 inbound trips and 86
outbound trips) during the weekday AM peak hour. During the weekday PM peak hour, the
proposed project is expected to generate a net increase of 214 vehicle trips (118 inbound trips
and 96 outbound trips). Over a 24-hour period, the proposed project is forecast to generate a net
increase of 2,967 daily trip ends during a typical weekday (approximately 1,484 inbound trips
and 1,484 outbound trips).

8.1.2 Weekend Project Trip Generation Summary
The Saturday trip generation forecast for the proposed project also is summarized in Table 8­1.
As summarized in Table 8­1, the proposed project is expected to generate a net increase of 274
vehicle trips (154 inbound trips and 120 outbound trips) during the Saturday mid-day peak hour.
Over a 24-hour weekend period, the proposed project is forecast to generate a net increase of
3,111 vehicle trips (approximately 1,556 inbound trips and 1,556 outbound trips).

               [5] A 50 percent (50%) internal trip adjustment was included to account for the synergistic effects between the hotel and restaurant land use components of the proposed project.
               [6] It is noted that three separate restaurant spaces including a portion of the kitchen area within the hotel have been aggregated for purposes of forecasting project-related trips.
                   It is assumed that these three restaurant uses will operate as high-turnover (sit-down) restaurant uses.

8.2        Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
Project traffic volumes both entering and exiting the site have been distributed and assigned to
the adjacent street system based on the following considerations:

      ·    The site's proximity to major traffic corridors (i.e., Valley Boulevard, New Avenue, Del
           Mar Avenue, San Gabriel Boulevard, etc.);

      ·    Expected localized traffic flow patterns based on adjacent roadway channelization and
           presence of traffic signals;

      ·    Existing intersection traffic volumes;

      ·    Ingress/egress scheme planned for the proposed project; and

      ·    Input from City staff.

For intersections located outside of the traffic analysis study area, the project traffic distribution
is expected to continue to disperse the greater the distance from the project site. The general,
directional traffic distribution patterns for the proposed project are presented in Figures 8­1 and
8­2 for the hotel and restaurant components, respectively. The forecast net new weekday AM
and PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections associated with the proposed project
are presented in Figures 8­3 and 8­4, respectively. The forecast net new Saturday mid-day peak
hour traffic volumes at the study intersections associated with the proposed project are displayed
in Figure 8­5. The traffic volume assignments presented in Figures 8­3, 8­4, and 8­5 reflect
the traffic distribution characteristics shown in Figures 8­1 and 8­2 and the project traffic
generation forecast presented in Table 8­1. Additionally, the traffic volume assignments
presented in Figures 8­3, 8­4, and Figure 8­5 reflect the existing use traffic distribution
characteristics shown in Appendix C (refer to Appendix Figure C­1) and the existing use traffic
generation forecast presented in Table 8­1.

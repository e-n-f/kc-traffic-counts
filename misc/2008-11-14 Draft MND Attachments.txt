                                                                       i
1. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

St. Mary's College High School (SMCHS) is currently preparing a Master Plan for its campus.
As part of the Master Plan, the school is proposing demolition or alteration of three buildings on
campus. The buildings ­ Vellesian Hall, St. Joseph's Hall, and Cronin Hall ­ were constructed
between 1946 and 1959 and are being studied for their potential to be considered historical
resources for the purposes of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The study area
for this project is the SMCHS campus, which is contained within one assessor parcel at 1294
Albina Avenue. The campus has a Berkeley address, but most of its area, including the location
of the three buildings studied in this report, is located within the City of Albany. Figure 1
depicts the general location of the study area for this project.

CEQA requires that the City of Albany, as the project's lead agency, determine the significance
of impacts the project may have to historical resources. Lamphier-Gregory is preparing the
Master Plan document for SMCHS and hired JRP Historical Consulting, LLC (JRP) to provide
assistance for the project's CEQA compliance as it pertains to historical resources. This study is
limited to the inventory and evaluation of Vellesian Hall, St. Joseph's Hall, and Cronin Hall,
because they are the only buildings that the SMCHS Master Plan will impact and have potential
to be considered historical resources. JRP conducted this study in accordance with Section
15064.5(a)-(b) of the CEQA Guidelines using the criteria outlined in Section 5924.1 of the
California Public Resources Code as well as Section 15126.4 of the CEQA Guidelines.

JRP inventoried and evaluated Vellesian Hall, St. Joseph's Hall, and Cronin Hall to assess
whether the any of these buildings should be considered a historical resource for the purposes of
CEQA, i.e. whether they are listed in, determined eligible for listing in, or appear to meet the
criteria for listing in the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR) or the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Because the City of Albany does not have a historic
preservation ordinance, there were no local criteria to apply. The three buildings are described
and evaluated on Department of Parks and Recreation Primary and Buildings Structures and
Objects Record forms (DPR 523 forms) provided in Appendix A.

JRP concludes that the three buildings studied for this report do not appear to meet the criteria
for listing in the NRHP / CRHR. Thus, St. Joseph's Hall, Cronin Hall, and Vellesian Hall are
not historical resources for the purpose of CEQA. The SMCHS Master Plan will not, therefore,
cause a significant impact on any historical resources and no mitigation measures are necessary.

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION1

The implementation of the SMCHS Master Plan will affect three of the existing buildings on the
campus. Vellesian Hall, constructed in 1946 and renovated in 1985, will be demolished. Cronin
Hall, constructed in two phases in 1952 and 1959, will be renovated as part of this project,
including seismic reinforcement. Finally, St. Joseph's Hall, built in 1957 and renovated in the
early 1970s, will also be renovated and expanded. Seismic deficiencies will be addressed,
including the removal or reinforcement of the brick veneer. The plans also include a large
addition on the east side of St. Joseph's Hall that will nearly double the size of the building.

3. RESEARCH AND FIELD METHODS

As noted above, SMCHS is located on a single assessor parcel, APN 65-2428-1, which
constituted the study area for this project. This report examines historic architectural resources
and does not identify or evaluate archaeological resources. The steps taken to identify possible
historical resources and potential impacts the project may have on historical resources follow
CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5(a)-(b).

JRP had a records search conducted at the Northwest Information Center at Sonoma State
University in December 2007 (NWIC File No: 07-0857). The results of the search revealed no
resources at the campus. Historic sites are located nearby, including the original site of the Jose
Peralta adobe, but they will not be impacted by the school's Master Plan. JRP also examined the
standard sources of information that list and identify known and potential historical resources to
determine if any buildings, structures, objects, districts, or sites have been previously recorded or
evaluated in or near the study area. JRP reviewed the NRHP, Office of Historic Preservation
Determinations of Eligibility for the NRHP, California Inventory of Historic Resources,
California Historic Landmarks, California Points of Historical Interest, and the Alameda County
Historic Sites Directory. The review of the NRHP listed or eligible properties was necessary
because these properties would automatically be eligible for listing in the CRHR and would be
considered historical resources for the purposes of CEQA. None of the registers or lists
identified additional potential historical resources in the study area.2

JRP conducted fieldwork and research in the City of Albany in December 2007, and inventoried
the three buildings included in this project for recordation on DPR 523 forms. JRP prepared a
historic context to address the themes and background for the property and evaluated the
buildings under the CRHR and NRHP criteria on the DPR 523 forms; the latter criteria applied
because properties that are listed in or eligible for listing in the NRHP are automatically eligible
for listing in the CRHR. Historical research was conducted at the California State Library, Saint
Mary's College High School, and the District Archives for the Brothers of the Christian Schools
at the De La Salle Institute. The description and historical evaluation of the buildings at SMCHS
are summarized in Sections 5 and 6. Refer to the references in Section 7 for a complete list of
materials consulted, and to Section 8 for preparers' professional qualifications. The DPR 523
forms are included in Appendix A.

4. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

Saint Mary's College High School is located in the southeast corner of the City of Albany at
1294 Albina Avenue. The campus slightly straddles the line between Albany and the City of
Berkeley which runs along Codornices Creek; however, all of the buildings studied for this
report are located on the Albany side of the boundary. The De La Salle Christian Brothers first
occupied the site in 1903 and still operate SMCHS. All of the buildings that currently comprise
the school were constructed after World War II. The following discussion describes the history
of Saint Mary's College High School from its 1863 founding in San Francisco to its history at
the current location. Please reference the sketch map in Figure 2 for the current locations of the
buildings on the campus.

4.1. Alameda County and Albany History

The City of Albany in Alameda County occupies the northern portion of what was once an
expansive land grant called Rancho San Antonio. The grant encompassed what is now Berkeley,
Albany, Emeryville, Piedmont, and a portion of San Leandro, and reached from the eastern shore
of San Francisco Bay to crest of the Contra Costa hills. The last Spanish Governor of California,
Pablo Vicente de Sola, awarded a land grant of 43,000 acres to distinguished Spanish soldier
Don Luis Maria Peralta in 1820. Don Luis never lived on the rancho and in 1842, two decades
after Mexico won its independence from Spain, he divided the land equally between his four
sons. Don Luis gave his son Domingo Peralta the northern end of the grant, which now
encompasses Albany and Berkeley. Like his father, Peralta ran cattle on the lush hills that were
also covered with oak trees. The tallow and hides from his operation were loaded onto ships
destined for American and foreign markets. Peralta's original adobe ranch home stood on the
south bank of Codornices Creek. Domingo Peralta entertained neighbors and traveling guests at
the rancho with rodeos and lavish feasts. In 1849, this pastoral and serene lifestyle changed
dramatically with the Gold Rush.3

Upon arriving in the San Francisco Bay area, settlers quickly realized the value of Domingo
Peralta's land and, by the time California achieved statehood in 1850, many of those who did not
gravitate to the gold mines purchased or illegally squatted on the majority of what was formerly
Peralta land. In 1853, California Governor Bigler authorized the creation of Alameda County.
The new county consisted of 760 square miles of land and 80 square miles of water.4

Early industrial development in the area began during the 1860s. The Civil War and the
transcontinental railroad claimed most of the gunpowder produced in the east. However,
enterprising businessmen in Albany began producing gunpowder to supplement the nation's
supply, which became one of the principal industries in this portion of the East Bay that led to its
further development. In 1879, the Giant Gunpowder Company (which later became the Judson
and Sheppard Chemical Works) built a plant at Fleming Point on the current site of Golden Gate
Fields racetrack. The plant closed in 1892 after several deadly explosions. The Judson
Dynamite and Powder Company followed with an explosives plant on the west slope of Albany
hill in 1898. It too suffered a series of deadly explosions and closed in 1905, ending the presence
of the explosives industry in Albany. The West Coast Kalsomine Company opened a shop on
the west slope of Cerrito Hill that produced the paints used on the 1915 Panama Pacific
Exposition buildings in San Francisco.5

An important contributing factor to the settlement of what became Albany was the development
of the University of California in Berkeley. In 1868, the state of California designated the
College of California, situated on the northwestern portion of the former Rancho San Antonio, as
the University of California. As the university grew, the surrounding area provided housing,
stores, and restaurants for the influx of students and professors.6

Settlement and development in the East Bay received another boost as refugees fled San
Francisco following the 1906 earthquake and fires. Real estate companies in northern Alameda
County promoted the undeveloped area in the East Bay as a safer alternative to San Francisco.
The population grew drastically in established cities like Berkeley following the earthquake.
Berkeley's population increased from approximately 13,000 to 40,000 between 1900 and 1910.
During this period, a conflict between the citizens of Berkeley and their neighbors led to the
incorporation of the City of Albany. For many years, Berkeley dumped its garbage in the area
around San Pablo Avenue in an area called Ocean View. Citizens in that area united to halt the
dumping and to incorporate the town of Ocean View in 1908. Voters changed the name of the
new town to Albany in 1909. In 1927, Albany adopted its first official charter and the town
formed its own school district in 1929.7 Albany's population expanded from 911 in 1910 to over
14,000 in 1945 largely because of employment opportunities provided by war-related industries.
The federal government subsidized housing projects in the Albany area for the families of
military personnel stationed in the Bay Area and employees of the Richmond shipyards.8

4.2. History of Saint Mary's College High School

Saint Mary's College High School began as part of Saint Mary's College in San Francisco.
Archbishop Joseph Sadoc Alemany established the college in the 1860s to bolster Catholic
education in the area. He lobbied for the De La Salle Christian Brothers, a respected teaching
order, to come to California and administer the school, but the organization decided its American
resources were too thin and could not be spared. In 1867, Alemany traveled to Rome and
appealed to the Pope, who granted his support to the plan. The following year, a group of
Christian Brothers made the journey to the West Coast and took control of Saint Mary's
College.9

History of the Christian Brothers, San Francisco District

In San Francisco, the Christian Brothers took over a school with both day and boarding students
ranging from primary to university levels, which was a common arrangement at the time. The
school succeeded in tripling the number of students in a single year and increased its relationship
with "feeder schools" in the area, including Saint Joseph's Academy in Oakland, a grammar
school founded in 1870. The San Francisco District of Christian Brothers also established or
operated schools in other parts of California (Sacramento, Oakland, Santa Barbara, San Rafael,
and Santa Cruz) as well as Oregon and Washington. These developments enabled Saint Mary's
College to purchase land in Oakland, where they constructed a large brick building to house the
college and high school. The Christian Brothers moved St. Mary's College and High School to
the new brick building in Oakland in 1889. Fires nearly destroyed the Oakland facility in 1894
and 1918, but the school rebuilt and continued in Oakland until 1927, when the high school and
college split and relocated to Peralta Park and Moraga, respectively.10

Peralta Park and the Christian Brothers

As mentioned above, squatters became a problem on Jose Domingo Peralta's property in
Alameda County after the Gold Rush. Peralta sold much of his holdings by 1853, and his heirs
split the remaining land after his death in 1865. Portions of the property changed owners
multiple times before the 1880s, including 60 acres around Codornices Creek that later became
Peralta Park and the home of SMCHS. In 1887, Maurice B. Curtis purchased these 60 acres with
plans to sell lots for a residential subdivision. Curtis, a very popular actor, also constructed a
grand hotel to serve as a retirement home for his colleagues in the theater. The Peralta Park

Hotel was completed and opened in 1891. The 60-room hotel was an extravagant and large
building with multiple spires and towers. The subdivision that surrounded the hotel became a
desirable neighborhood, and several large homes were constructed on the tree-lined lots. Despite
the success of the subdivision, the hotel quickly outdistanced its owner's finances, and Curtis
sold the property to cover his debts. The hotel became Peralta Hall and served as a boarding
school, nightclub, and candy factory before the Christian Brothers purchased the property and
building in 1903.11

Saint Mary's College High School in Peralta Park

The Christian Brothers moved St. Joseph's Academy from Oakland to Peralta Hall in Peralta
Park in 1903, when the area was all still part of Berkeley. The large hotel building, now called
Peralta Hall, offered much better facilities than the poor conditions of their building in Oakland.
Deteriorating facilities at the college and high school building in Oakland also motivated the
Brothers to consider relocating those students. As mentioned above, the college moved to new
facilities in Moraga in 1927. At the same time, the Christian Brothers commissioned a new
three-story building at Peralta Park, De La Salle Hall, to provide classrooms for the high school,
and instruction began at the new location in 1927. Peralta Hall continued to house St. Joseph's
Academy and served as a dormitory for boarding students and brothers.12

By the 1940s, the deteriorating condition of Peralta Hall prompted plans for new campus
buildings. In 1946, those plans became more pressing after a fire swept through the upper
portion of the old hotel. After the fire, the top two stories were determined structurally unsound
and were removed for the safety of the students, but the lower floors remained in service as the
school library and dormitory. In the same year as the fire, Vellesian Hall, designed by San
Francisco architect Vincent Buckley, was constructed along Codornices Creek on the southeast
end of campus to serve as housing for campus workers.13

New construction on the Peralta Park campus continued over the next decade as demand for
updated facilities grew. Two years after the construction of Vellesian Hall, the school added a
new gymnasium. In 1952, the school completed the first phase of Cronin Hall, also designed by
Buckley. Located on the western edge of the campus, it provided two classrooms that served the
grammar school classes of St. Joseph's Academy. In 1956, the school built St. Joseph's Hall

south of the gymnasium according to plans by Buckley and Fred Houweling. This two-story
building was constructed following common academic building configuration. The rectangular
footprint design was built with a center hall flanking classrooms on the first story with a library
at one end, and included the student dormitory on the upper floor.14 In 1959, seismic
inadequacies forced the school to demolish the remaining portion of Peralta Hall. In the same
year, Cronin Hall was expanded to the south along the western border of the campus, adding
more classroom space for the high school.15 The oblique aerial photo below (Photograph 1)
shows the campus around 1959, following the demolition of Peralta Hall and construction of
Cronin Hall's extension. The gymnasium, with its prominent façade pilasters, is situated north
of St. Joseph's Hall and to the east of Cronin Hall. The "L" shaped De La Salle Hall was
prominently situated, at this time, on the east side of campus south of the sports field and north
of Vellesian Hall.

After 1960 and over the next several decades, changes continued at the SMCHS campus. With
its limited space on its Peralta Park property, the school remodeled several buildings, built
14
   Along with his designs for SMCHS, Buckley designed St. Ambrose Catholic Church in Berkeley, the Shrine of St.
Therese in Fresno, and Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Oakland, all in the 1950s. Research did not produce further
information about Houweling. "Parish Will Build Church Near Lake," Oakland Tribune, August 27, 1959; other

additions, altered the landscape features, used and then replaced temporary buildings, and built
new buildings in much of the remaining open space on campus. The school concentrated most
of its development on the west side of campus, even after De La Salle Hall was demolished. In
1969, the grammar boarding school, St. Joseph's Academy, relocated to the Christian Brothers'
district headquarters at Mont La Salle in Napa, leaving the entire Peralta Park campus to the high
school. In order to accommodate the school's anticipated needs over the next decades, the
Christian Brothers commissioned and instituted a master plan in the early 1970s. De La Salle
Hall was demolished in 1973 because of seismic deficiencies, so much of the master plan was
devoted to making up for the lost space and facilities. The upper-floor dorm rooms in St.
Joseph's Hall were converted to office space in 1972. New buildings included a new cafeteria
and gymnasium expansion in 1976 and a new Brothers' Residence in 1978. After housing
campus workers, the west end of Vellesian Hall became a maintenance shop, while the rest of the
building became office space in 1985. In the last twenty years, changes have continued at
SMCHS. The school became co-educational in 1995 and changed to an all day-student
population. The campus has continued to evolve with alterations to buildings and the
replacement of temporary classrooms with permanent classroom buildings in 1986 and 2002.
The current master plan for the campus recommends further measures intended to meet the
evolving needs of Saint Mary's College High School, including the removal of Vellesian Hall,
the renovation of Cronin Hall, and the expansion of St. Joseph's Hall.16

The various periods of construction and development led to a variety of architectural expressions
on campus, with little apparent architectural continuity over time. The architecture of the older
buildings on campus ranges from the utilitarian design of Vellesian Hall to the Moderne style of
the older portion of the gymnasium and mid-twentieth century Contemporary style of St.
Joseph's Hall. Cronin Hall is generally a utilitarian style building that incorporates the exterior
hallway design common to California schools constructed in the 1950s.

St. Joseph's Hall, situated at the main entrance driveway and originally built opposite De La
Salle Hall, was, as noted above, built with a common form for educational buildings that
included a symmetrical façade around a main entrance, central main hall, and multitude of
windows. Its exterior design provided an updated appearance for the traditionally laid out
academic building. The style of St. Joseph's Hall can be referred to as "Contemporary style,"
which denotes a combination of elements that derive, in part, from mid-twentieth century
Modernism along with traditional forms. The low-pitch roof, wide eaves, and bands of brick
cladding and concrete, influenced by the unadorned, efficient, and functional tenets of
Modernism, provide a strong horizontal emphasis to the design of St. Joseph's Hall. This is
enhanced by the slender metal frame fenestration with shallow insets. There is also only modest

architectural detailing, such as the cast concrete door surrounds, cartouches, and glass block
windows forming a cross. Although its lack of ornament and horizontality follow some elements
of mid-twentieth century Modernism, its general form and layout also complement the traditional
form of conventional, rectangular educational buildings, such as De La Salle Hall.

This section provides a description of the three buildings SMCHS is proposing to either demolish
or alter as part of the campus Master Plan. The buildings ­ Vellesian Hall, St. Joseph's Hall, and
Cronin Hall ­ are noted in Figure 2, along with the current locations of all the facilities on the
campus.

5.1. Vellesian Hall

Vellesian Hall (Photograph 2) is located in the southeast section of the SMCHS campus. San
Francisco architect Vincent Buckley designed the one-story, wood-frame building, which was
constructed in 1946. It is rectangular with an east-west alignment and rests on a reinforced
concrete foundation. Its low-pitch roof is hipped on the west end with a gable on the east end.
The roof is covered by rolled composite roofing and has a moderate overhang with closed eaves,
metal gutters, and downspouts. The sides of the building are clad in stucco. The north side of
the building has a recessed entryway containing a single wood door with a small security
window and a wood frame. A similar door is located on the east end of the building. A slightly
recessed single wood door is located on the south side. A roll-up aluminum door is located on
the west end of the building. The windows in the building are aluminum sliders with wood
frames and sills. Concrete steps and ramps provide access to all entrances.17

5.2. Cronin Hall

Cronin Hall (Photographs 3 and 4) is located along the western edge of the SMCHS campus
and was also designed by Vincent Buckley. The building was constructed in two phases: the
northernmost two classrooms were a stand-alone, wood-frame building finished in 1952; the
remainder of the building was added in 1959. This extension of the original portion is also of

wood-frame construction and has a basement for most of its length. The entire building rests on
a reinforced concrete foundation and concrete footings and is rectangular with a north-south
alignment and a dogleg extension at the southwest end.18

The side gable roof is covered by composite shingles and has no overhang on the gable ends and
a slight overhang on the west side. An exterior hallways is situated under an extension of the
roof that shelters the entire east side of the building. Wood posts support the northern portion of
the hallway roof, along the first two classrooms, which is the portion constructed in 1952. Steel
posts and brick and stucco pillars at the middle and southeast corners support the remainder of
the hallway roof. The roof has open eaves with metal gutters and downspouts. The sides of the
building are clad in stucco. The east side of the building has a brick veneer skirt and has metal
lockers attached to the wall. The hallway on the east side of the building shelters the entrances
to several classrooms, each of which has a single metal door. Neither of the gable ends of the
building contains doors or windows. The top story of the building is at grade on the east side,
with the lower floor at grade on the west and south sides. The west side of the building contains
three single metal doors. The west side of the northern portion of the building contains two sets
of six, two-over-three aluminum windows with wood frames, the middle panes of which are
awning windows. The remaining windows on the top story are four sets of seven ribbon
windows in a one-over-three configuration. The lower floor windows are also one-over-three
wood frame windows. Concrete steps and ramps provide access to all entrances.

5.3. St. Joseph's Hall

St. Joseph's Hall (Photograph 5) is located near the center of the SMCHS campus, and was
designed by Vincent Buckley and Fred Houweling. The three-story building, constructed in
1956, has a rectangular plan, with a north-south alignment and reinforced concrete foundation.
The interior frame, including the columns, girders, and tie beams are also reinforced concrete.
Composite built-up roofing and red lava rock cover the slightly pitched hip roof. The roof has a
narrow overhang with closed eaves with metal gutters and downspouts. The top story of the
building is at grade on the north end, with the ground sloping away to the south. The basement
level is at grade on the south end of the building. The exterior of the first and second stories are
clad in a blonde Roman brick veneer. A band of stucco separates these bands of brick. Stucco
also covers the lower story of the building and the eastern side of the stairwell on the south end.

Two cartouches are located on the east side of the building. One is located in the stucco band
over the main entrance and a second is over the window lintel to the right of the main entrance.
Four glass-block windows forming a cross are located on the east side of the southern stairwell.
The remaining windows in the building are two-over-four or two-over-five aluminum windows
in which the middle panes tilt open as awning windows. The windows are contained within the
brick bands and are recessed with protruding brick sills.

The building has two main entrances. The east entrance is contained within the brick band on
the first story. A wide, cast-concrete door surround frames the door. The glass double door and
the window above it have aluminum frames. The door on the north side of the building
(Photograph 6) has a similar brick and cast-concrete surround, with a modern replacement
double glazed door. A matching door and surround is located on the south end of the building.
The entrances on the west side are single glazed wood doors with a transom window. All
entrances are accessible by concrete ramps and steps that were added in recent years
(Photograph 7 shows the appearance of the north end of the building before the addition of the
ramp and alteration of the north-end entry stairs).19

6. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

6.1. Evaluation Criteria

JRP used the CRHR and NRHP criteria to evaluate the historic significance of Vellesian Hall,
Cronin Hall, and St. Joseph's Hall on the SMCHS campus. Because the City of Albany, the lead
agency for this project, does not have a historic preservation ordinance, there were no local
criteria to apply.

The criteria for listing properties in the CRHR are in Section 15064.5(a)(2)-(3) of the CEQA
Guidelines, which provide the criteria from Section 20524.1 of the California Public Resources
Code. The CRHR is in the California Code of Regulations Title 14, Chapter 11.5. According to
this code, properties eligible for listing in the NRHP are automatically eligible for listing in the
CRHR. The CRHR criteria are largely based on the NRHP, which are codified in 36 CFR Part
60 and explained in guidelines published by the Keeper of the National Register.20

Eligibility for listing in either the NRHP or CRHR rests on twin factors of significance and
integrity. A property must have both significance and integrity to be considered eligible. Loss
of integrity, if sufficiently great, will overwhelm historical significance a property may possess
and render it ineligible. Likewise, a property can have complete integrity, but if it lacks
significance, it must also be considered ineligible.

Historic significance is judged by applying the NRHP and CRHR criteria. The NRHP criteria
are identified as Criteria A through D, the CRHR as Criteria 1 through 4. The NRHP guidelines
states that a historic resource's "quality of significance in American history, architecture,
archeology, engineering and culture" be determined by meeting at least one of the four main
criteria. Properties may be significant at the local, state, or national level:

        Criterion A: association with events or trends significant in the broad patterns of
                      our history;
        Criterion B: association with the lives of significant individuals;
        Criterion C: a property that embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type,
                      period, or method of construction, represents the work of a master,
                      or that possesses high artistic values;
        Criterion D: has yielded, or is likely to yield information important to history or
                      prehistory.



20
  The most widely accepted guidelines are contained in the U.S. Department of Interior, National Park Service,
"Guidelines for Applying the National Register Criteria for Evaluation," National Register Bulletin 15 (Washington
D.C.: US Government Printing, 1991, revised 1995 through 2002).


                                                       18
In general, Criterion D is used to evaluate historic sites and archaeological resources. Although
buildings and structures can occasionally be recognized for the important information they might
yield regarding historic construction or technologies, the buildings within the study area for this
project are of building types that are well documented. Thus, the buildings that are the subject of
this report are not a principal source of important information in this regard.

Certain property types are usually excluded from consideration for listing in the NRHP, but can
be considered if they meet special requirements in addition to meeting the regular criteria. The
following are the seven Criteria Considerations that deal with properties usually excluded from
listing in the National Register: 21

     Consideration A:   Religious Properties
     Consideration B:   Moved Properties
     Consideration C:   Birthplaces and Graves
     Consideration D:   Cemeteries
     Consideration E:   Reconstructed Properties
     Consideration F:   Commemorative Properties
     Consideration G:   Properties that have Achieved Significance within the Past
                        Fifty Years

Integrity is determined through applying seven factors to the historical resource. Those factors
are location, design, setting, workmanship, materials, feeling, and association. These seven can
be roughly grouped into three types of integrity considerations. Location and setting relate to the
relationship between the property and its environment. Design, materials, and workmanship, as
they apply to historic buildings, relate to construction methods and architectural details. Feeling
and association are the least objective of the seven criteria, pertaining to the overall ability of the
property to convey a sense of the historical time and place in which it was constructed.

The CRHR criteria closely parallel those of the NRHP. Each resource must be determined to be
significant at the local, state, or national level under one of four criteria (paraphrased below) in
order to be determined eligible:

        Criterion 1: Resources associated with important events that have made a
        significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history.
        Criterion 2: Resources associated with the lives of persons important to our past.

  USDI, National Park Service, "How to Apply the National Register Criteria for Evaluation," National Register
Bulletin 15, 25, 41-43; USDI, National Park Service, "Guidelines for Evaluating and Nominating Properties that
have Achieved Significance within the Last Fifty Years," National Register Bulletin No. 22 (Washington, D.C.:
Government Printing Officer, 1979, revised 1990 and 1996).


                                                     19
        Criterion 3: Resources that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type,
        period, or method of construction, or represents the work of a master.
        Criterion 4: Resources that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information
        important in prehistory or history.22

As was the case with NRHP Criterion D, the buildings in the study area do not appear to be
significant under CRHR Criterion 4 because they are not a principal source of important
information in this regard.

The CRHR definition of integrity and its special considerations for certain properties are slightly
different than those for the NRHP. Integrity is defined as "the authenticity of an historical
resource's physical identity evidenced by the survival of characteristics that existed during the
resource's period of significance." The CRHR further states that eligible resources must "retain
enough of their historic character or appearance to be recognizable as historical resources and to
convey the reasons for their significance," and lists the same seven aspects of integrity used for
evaluating properties under the NRHP criteria. The CRHR's special considerations for certain
properties types are limited to: 1) moved buildings, structures, or objects; 2) historical resources
achieving significance within the past fifty years; and 3) reconstructed buildings. The CRHR
does not have a special consideration for religious properties.

6.2. Historic Evaluation

None of the three buildings included in this project appear to meet the criteria for listing in the
NRHP or CRHR. The three buildings are evaluated as individual buildings within the context of
the development of SMCHS. The buildings do not have potential significance as contributors to
a historic district because, with its multiple late twentieth century buildings, the campus lacks
sufficient concentration of potential historical resources that might constitute a historic district.23

Under Criteria A (1), none of the three buildings appears to be significant because they lack
important association with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of local and regional history. SMCHS is associated with the development of Christian Brothers
Catholic education in California, which began in the 1860s. SMCHS was one of many
California schools administered by the Christian Brothers and includes buildings from a period
after the Catholic education system was well established in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Although the Peralta Park campus has association with Christian Brothers education as early as
1903, the buildings studied for this report date to the mid-twentieth century, 1946 to 1959, and

illustrate the incremental improvements that were made to the campus as its older facilities
deteriorated. Each of these three buildings ­ Vellesian Hall, Cronin Hall, and St. Joseph's Hall ­
contributed to the development of SMCHS, but none can be associated with the important early
education efforts of the Christian Brothers in the San Francisco Bay Area. Furthermore, none of
the three buildings individually is importantly associated with trends or events that are
significant to local, regional, state, or national history.

Under Criteria B (2), none of the three buildings appears to be significant for their association
with the lives of persons important to local, California, or national history.

Under Criteria C (3), none of the three buildings appears to be significant as an important
example of a type, period, or method of construction; nor do they appear to be the work of a
master artist or craftsman or possess high artistic values. Vellesian Hall is a utilitarian-designed
building that exhibits little significant architectural qualities of 1940s architecture. Similarly,
Cronin Hall is generally a utilitarian design that has the exterior hallway common to 1950s
school buildings in California. As discussed in Section 4, St. Joseph's Hall is designed in a
Contemporary Style incorporating some elements of mid-twentieth century Modernism while
adhering to the traditional building form of a conventional educational building. It is
representative of its period of construction, but is a modest example of 1950s-era educational
architecture and is not significant within its architectural context.

Vellesian Hall, Cronin Hall, and St. Joseph's Hall are not the work of a master. San Francisco
architect Vincent Buckley designed all three of the buildings in this project, with assistance from
architect Fred Houweling on St. Joseph's Hall. Early in his career, Buckley was a draftsman
with John J. Foley who did work for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese, including Star of the Sea
Church (1928) and Grammar School (1931) in Richmond. In the 1920s, Buckley was in the firm
Griewank & Buckley, construction engineers, and he worked with architect H.A. Minton who
also did work for the Archdiocese. In the 1950s, Buckley designed St. Ambrose Catholic Church
in Berkeley, the Shrine of St. Therese in Fresno, and Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Oakland.
In spite of these commissions, the historic record does not provide evidence of Vincent
Buckley's significance as an architect. The record also revealed little information regarding the
career of Fred Houweling.24

As stated, none of the three buildings appears to be significant under Criteria D (4) because this
criterion is usually used to evaluate historic sites and archaeological resources. Although
buildings and structures can occasionally be recognized for the important information they might

yield regarding historic construction or technologies, the SMCHS buildings are building types
that are well documented and are not a principal source of important information in this regard.

Vellesian Hall does not retain its historic integrity following the 1985 renovation that converted
the west end of the building into a maintenance shop, added a roll up garage door, and modified
the roof. Cronin Hall began as a small building with two classrooms before the 1959 expansion
to its current size. The building retains integrity to its 1959 construction. St. Joseph's Hall
retains a large degree of its historic integrity, with the primary exception of the entrance on the
north side and its accessible replacement door. Although the buildings retain some historic
integrity, they lack historic significance and thus none appears to meet the criteria for listing in
the NRHP.

Furthermore, if these buildings were to be eligible for listing in the NRHP their significance
would need to meet the NRHP Criteria Consideration A for Religious Properties because they
were constructed by and are presently owned by a religious institution, the Christian Brothers.
None of the three buildings meets the standards established by Criteria Consideration A because
they do not possess architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance.

Vellesian Hall, Cronin Hall, and St. Joseph's Hall at 1294 Albina Avenue have been evaluated in
accordance with Section 15064.5(a)(2)-(3) of the CEQA Guidelines using the criteria outlined in
Section 5024.1 of the California Public Resources Code. None of these buildings appears to
meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP and CRHR. Thus, the three buildings included in this
study do not appear to be historical resources for the purposes of CEQA. Therefore, there will
be no substantial adverse changes to the significance of historical resources and no mitigation
measures will be necessary.

St. Joseph's Hall (Photograph 1) is located near the center of the campus of St. Mary's College High School in the City of
Albany in Alameda County. The school campus is also partially in Berkeley, and the school uses a Berkeley street address.
The three-story building, designed by Vincent Buckley and Fred Houweling, was constructed in 1956 and has a rectangular
plan with a north-south alignment and reinforced concrete foundation. The interior frame, including the columns, girders,
and tie beams are also reinforced concrete. Composite built-up roofing and red lava rock cover the slightly pitched hip roof.
The roof has a narrow overhang with closed eaves with metal gutters and downspouts. The top story of the building is at
grade on the north end, with the ground sloping away to the south. The basement level is at grade on the south end of the
building. (See Continuation Sheet.)

St. Joseph's Hall on the Saint Mary's College High School at 1294 Albina Avenue has been evaluated in
accordance with Section 15064.5(a)(2)-(3) of the CEQA Guidelines outlined in Section 5024.1 of the California
Public Resources Code. The building lacks significance and therefore does not appear to meet the criteria for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or California Register of Historic Resources (CRHR)
and therefore does not appear to be a historical resource for the purposes of CEQA. (See Continuation Sheet.)

P3a. Description (continued):

The exterior of the first and second stories are clad in a blonde Roman brick veneer. A band of stucco separates these bands
of brick. Stucco also covers the lower story of the building and the eastern side of the stairwell on the south end.

Two cartouches are located on the east side of the building. One is located in the stucco band over the main entrance and a
second is over the window lintel to the right of the main entrance. Four glass-block windows forming a cross are located on
the east side of the southern stairwell. The remaining windows in the building are two-over-four or two-over-five aluminum
windows in which the middle panes tilt open as awning windows. The windows are contained within the brick bands and
are recessed with protruding brick sills.

The building has two main entrances. The east entrance is contained within the brick band on the first story. A wide, cast-
concrete door surround frames the door. The glass double door and the window above it have aluminum frames. The door
on the north side of the building (Photograph 3) has a similar brick and cast-concrete surround, with a modern replacement
double glazed door. A matching door and surround is located on the south end of the building. The entrances on the west
side are single glazed wood doors with a transom window. All entrances are accessible by concrete ramps and steps that
were added in recent years (Photograph 4 shows the appearance of the north end of the building before the addition of the
ramp and alteration of the north end entry stairs).1

B10. Significance

Historical Overview

Saint Mary's College High School is located in the southeast corner of the City of Albany at 1294 Albina Avenue. The
campus slightly straddles the line between Albany and the City of Berkeley which runs along Codornices Creek; however,
St. Joseph's Hall is located on the Albany side of the boundary. The De La Salle Christian Brothers first occupied the site in
1903 and still operate SMCHS. All of the buildings that currently comprise the school were constructed after World War II.
The following discussion describes the history of Saint Mary's College High School from its 1863 founding in San
Francisco to its history at the current location. Please reference the sketch map for the current locations of the buildings on
the campus.

Alameda County and Albany History

The City of Albany in Alameda County occupies the northern portion of what was once an expansive land grant called
Rancho San Antonio. The grant encompassed what is now Berkeley, Albany, Emeryville, Piedmont, and a portion of San
Leandro, and reached from the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay to crest of the Contra Costa hills. The last Spanish
Governor of California, Pablo Vicente de Sola, awarded a land grant of 43,000 acres to distinguished Spanish soldier Don
Luis Maria Peralta in 1820. Don Luis never lived on the rancho and in 1842, two decades after Mexico won its
independence from Spain, he divided the land equally between his four sons. Don Luis gave his son Domingo Peralta the
northern end of the grant, which now encompasses Albany and Berkeley. In 1849, Peralta's pastoral rancho lifestyle
changed dramatically with the Gold Rush.2

Settlers arriving with the Gold Rush quickly realized the value of Domingo Peralta's land and, by the time California
achieved statehood in 1850, many of those who did not gravitate to the gold mines purchased or illegally squatted on the
majority of what was formerly Peralta land. In 1853, California Governor Bigler authorized the creation of Alameda
County. The new county consisted of 760 square miles of land and 80 square miles of water.3

Early industrial development in the area began during the 1860s. The Civil War and the transcontinental railroad claimed
most of the gunpowder produced in the east. However, enterprising businessmen in Albany began producing gunpowder to
supplement the nation's supply, which became one of the principal industries in this portion of the East Bay that led to its
further development. In 1879, the Giant Gunpowder Company (which later became the Judson and Sheppard Chemical
Works) built a plant at Fleming Point on the current site of Golden Gate Fields racetrack. The plant closed in 1892 after
several deadly explosions. The Judson Dynamite and Powder Company followed with an explosives plant on the west slope
of Albany hill in 1898. It too suffered a series of deadly explosions and closed in 1905, ending the presence of the
explosives industry in Albany. The West Coast Kalsomine Company opened a shop on the west slope of Cerrito Hill that
produced the paints used on the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition buildings in San Francisco.4

An important contributing factor to the settlement of what became Albany was the development of the University of
California in Berkeley. In 1868, the state of California designated the College of California, situated on the northwestern
portion of the former Rancho San Antonio, as the University of California. As the university grew, the surrounding area
provided housing, stores, and restaurants for the influx of students and professors.5

Settlement and development in the East Bay received another boost as refugees fled San Francisco following the 1906
earthquake and fires. Real estate companies in northern Alameda County promoted the undeveloped area in the East Bay as
a safer alternative to San Francisco. The population grew drastically in established cities like Berkeley following the
earthquake. Berkeley's population increased from approximately 13,000 to 40,000 between 1900 and 1910. During this
period, a conflict between the citizens of Berkeley and their neighbors led to the incorporation of the City of Albany. For
many years, Berkeley dumped its garbage in the area around San Pablo Avenue in an area called Ocean View. Citizens in
that area united to halt the dumping and to incorporate the town of Ocean View in 1908. Voters changed the name of the
new town to Albany in 1909. In 1927, Albany adopted its first official charter and the town formed its own school district in
1929.6 Albany's population expanded from 911 in 1910 to over 14,000 in 1945 largely because of employment
opportunities provided by war-related industries. The federal government subsidized housing projects in the Albany area for
the families of military personnel stationed in the Bay Area and employees of the Richmond shipyards.7

History of Saint Mary's College High School

Saint Mary's College High School began as part of Saint Mary's College in San Francisco. Archbishop Joseph Sadoc
Alemany established the college in the 1860s to bolster Catholic education in the area. He lobbied for the De La Salle
Christian Brothers, a respected teaching order, to come to California and administer the school, but the organization decided

its American resources were too thin and could not be spared. In 1867, Alemany traveled to Rome and appealed to the Pope,
who granted his support to the plan. The following year, a group of Christian Brothers made the journey to the West Coast
and took control of Saint Mary's College.8

History of the Christian Brothers, San Francisco District

In San Francisco, the Christian Brothers took over a school with both day and boarding students ranging from primary to
university levels, which was a common arrangement at the time. The school succeeded in tripling the number of students in
a single year and increased its relationship with "feeder schools" in the area, including Saint Joseph's Academy in Oakland,
a grammar school founded in 1870. The San Francisco District of Christian Brothers also established or operated schools in
other parts of California (Sacramento, Oakland, Santa Barbara, San Rafael, and Santa Cruz) as well as Oregon and
Washington. These developments enabled Saint Mary's College to purchase land in Oakland, where they constructed a
large brick building to house the college and high school. The Christian Brothers moved St. Mary's College and High
School to the new brick building in Oakland in 1889. Fires nearly destroyed the Oakland facility in 1894 and 1918, but the
school rebuilt and continued in Oakland until 1927, when the high school and college split and relocated to Peralta Park and
Moraga, respectively.9

Peralta Park and the Christian Brothers

As mentioned above, squatters became a problem on Jose Domingo Peralta's property in Alameda County after the Gold
Rush. Peralta sold much of his holdings by 1853, and his heirs split the remaining land after his death in 1865. Portions of
the property changed owners multiple times before the 1880s, including 60 acres around Codornices Creek that later became
Peralta Park and the home of SMCHS. In 1887, Maurice B. Curtis purchased these 60 acres with plans to sell lots for a
residential subdivision. Curtis, a very popular actor, also constructed a grand hotel to serve as a retirement home for his
colleagues in the theater. The Peralta Park Hotel was completed and opened in 1891. The 60-room hotel was an extravagant
and large building with multiple spires and towers. The subdivision that surrounded the hotel became a desirable
neighborhood, and several large homes were constructed on the tree-lined lots. Despite the success of the subdivision, the
hotel quickly outdistanced its owner's finances, and Curtis sold the property to cover his debts. The hotel became Peralta
Hall and served as a boarding school, nightclub, and candy factory before the Christian Brothers purchased the property and
building in 1903.10

Saint Mary's College High School in Peralta Park

The Christian Brothers moved St. Joseph's Academy from Oakland to Peralta Hall in Peralta Park in 1903, when the area
was all still part of Berkeley. The large hotel building, now called Peralta Hall, offered much better facilities than the poor
conditions of their building in Oakland. Deteriorating facilities at the college and high school building in Oakland also
motivated the Brothers to consider relocating those students. As mentioned above, the college moved to new facilities in
Moraga in 1927. At the same time, the Christian Brothers commissioned a new three-story building at Peralta Park, De La
Salle Hall, to provide classrooms for the high school, and instruction began at the new location in 1927. Peralta Hall
continued to house St. Joseph's Academy and served as a dormitory for boarding students and brothers.11

By the 1940s, the deteriorating condition of Peralta Hall prompted plans for new campus buildings. In 1946, those plans
became more pressing after a fire swept through the upper portion of the old hotel. After the fire, the top two stories were
determined structurally unsound and were removed for the safety of the students, but the lower floors remained in service as
the school library and dormitory. New construction on the Peralta Park campus began in the 1940s and continued over the
next decade as demand for updated facilities grew. One of the new buildings, constructed in 1956, was St. Joseph's Hall,
located south of the gymnasium and designed by Vincent Buckley and Fred Houweling. This two-story building was
constructed following common academic building configuration. The rectangular footprint design was built with a center
hall flanking classrooms on the first story with a library at one end, and included the student dormitory on the upper floor.12
In 1959, seismic inadequacies forced the school to demolish the remaining portion of Peralta Hall.13 The oblique aerial
photo below (Photograph 2) shows the campus around 1959 following the demolition of Peralta Hall and illustrates the
relationship of St. Joseph's Hall to the other campus buildings. The "L" shaped De La Salle Hall was prominently situated,
at this time, on the east side of campus south of the sports field and north of Vellesian Hall.14

After 1960 and over the next several decades, changes continued at the SMCHS campus. With its limited space in Peralta
Park, the school remodeled several buildings, built additions, altered the landscape features, used and then replaced
temporary buildings, and built new buildings in much of the remaining open space on campus. The school concentrated

and Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Oakland, all in the 1950s. Research did not produce further information about Houweling. "Parish

most of its development on the west side of campus, even after De La Salle Hall was demolished. In 1969, the grammar
boarding school, St. Joseph's Academy, relocated to the Christian Brothers' district headquarters at Mont La Salle in Napa,
leaving the entire Peralta Park campus to the high school. In order to accommodate the school's anticipated needs over the
next decades, the Christian Brothers commissioned and instituted a master plan in the early 1970s. De La Salle Hall was
demolished in 1973 because of seismic deficiencies, so much of the master plan was devoted to making up for the lost space.
The upper floor dorm rooms in St. Joseph's Hall were converted to office space in 1972. In the last twenty years, changes
have continued at SMCHS. The school became co-educational in 1995 and changed to an all day-student population. The
campus has continued to evolve with alterations to buildings and the replacement of temporary classrooms with permanent
classroom buildings in 1986 and 2002. The current master plan for the campus recommends further measures intended to
meet the evolving needs of Saint Mary's College High School, including the expansion of St. Joseph's Hall.15

The various periods of construction and development led to a variety of architectural expressions on campus, with little
apparent architectural continuity over time. The architecture of the older buildings on campus ranges from the utilitarian
design of Vellesian Hall to the Moderne style of the older portion of the gymnasium and mid-twentieth century
Contemporary style of St. Joseph's Hall. Cronin Hall is generally a utilitarian style building that incorporates the exterior
hallway design common to California schools built in the 1950s.

St. Joseph's Hall, situated at the main entrance driveway and originally built opposite De La Salle Hall, was, as noted above,
built with a common form for educational buildings that included a symmetrical façade around a main entrance, central main
hall, and multitude of windows. Its exterior design provided an updated appearance for the traditionally laid out academic
building. The style of St. Joseph's Hall can be referred to as "Contemporary style," which denotes a combination of
elements that derive, in part, from mid-twentieth century Modernism along with traditional forms. The low-pitch roof, wide
eaves, and bands of brick cladding and concrete, influenced by the unadorned, efficient, and functional tenets of Modernism,
provide a strong horizontal emphasis to the design of St. Joseph's Hall. This is enhanced by the slender metal frame
fenestration with shallow insets. There is also only modest architectural detailing, such as the cast concrete door surrounds,
cartouches, and glass block windows forming a cross. Although its lack of ornament and horizontality follow some
elements of mid-twentieth century Modernism, its general form and layout also complement the traditional form of
conventional, rectangular educational buildings, such as De La Salle Hall.

Discussion of Potential Significance

St. Joseph's Hall does not appear to meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP or CRHR.16

Under Criteria A (1), St. Joseph's Hall does not appear to be significant because it lacks important associations with events
that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of local and regional history. SMCHS is associated with the
development of Christian Brothers Catholic education in California, which began in the 1860s. SMCHS was one of many
California schools administered by the Christian Brothers and includes buildings from a period after the Catholic education
system was well established in the San Francisco Bay Area. Although the Peralta Park campus has association with
Christian Brothers education as early as 1903, St. Joseph's Hall dates to 1956 and illustrates the incremental improvements
that were made to the campus as its older facilities deteriorated. While St. Joseph's Hall contributed to the development of
SMCHS, it cannot be associated with the important early education efforts of the Christian Brothers in the San Francisco
Bay Area. Furthermore, the building is not individually importantly associated with trends or events that are significant to
local, regional, state, or national history.

Under Criteria B (2), St. Joseph's Hall does not appear to be significant for its association with the lives of persons
important to local, California, or national history.

Under Criteria C (3), St. Joseph's Hall does not appear to be significant as an important example of a type, period, or method
of construction; nor does it appear to be the work of a master artist or craftsman or possess high artistic values. As discussed
above, St. Joseph's Hall is designed in a Contemporary Style modestly incorporating some elements of mid-twentieth
century Modernism while adhering to the traditional building form of a conventional educational building. It is
representative of its period of construction, but is a modest example of 1950s-era educational architecture and is not
significant within its architectural context.

St. Joseph's Hall is not the work of a master. San Francisco architect Vincent Buckley designed the building with assistance
from architect Fred Houweling. Early in his career, Buckley was a draftsman with John J. Foley who did work for the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese, including Star of the Sea Church (1928) and Grammar School (1931) in Richmond. In the
1920s, Buckley was in the firm Griewank & Buckley, construction engineers, and he worked with architect H.A. Minton
who also did work for the Archdiocese. In the 1950s, Buckley designed St. Ambrose Catholic Church in Berkeley, the
Shrine of St. Therese in Fresno, and Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Oakland. In spite of these commissions, the historic
record does not provide evidence of Vincent Buckley's significance as an architect. The record also revealed little
information regarding the career of Fred Houweling.17

St. Joseph's Hall does not appear to be significant under Criteria D (4) because this criterion is usually used to evaluate
historic sites and archaeological resources. Although buildings and structures can occasionally be recognized for the
important information they might yield regarding historic construction or technologies, St. Joseph's Hall is a building type
that is well documented and is not a principal source of important information in this regard.

St. Joseph's Hall retains a large degree of its historic integrity, with the primary exception of the entrance on the north side
and its accessible replacement door. Although the building retains some historic integrity, it lacks historic significance and
thus does not appear to meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP or CRHR.

Furthermore, if this building was eligible for listing in the NRHP, its significance would need to meet the NRHP Criteria
Consideration A for Religious Properties because it was constructed by and is presently owned by a religious institution, the
Christian Brothers. St. Joseph's Hall does not meet the standards established by Criteria Consideration A because it does
not possess architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance.

St. Joseph's Hall at 1294 Albina Avenue has been evaluated in accordance with Section 15064.5(a)(2)-(3) of the CEQA
Guidelines using the criteria outlined in Section 5024.1 of the California Public Resources Code. It does not appear to meet
the criteria for listing in the NRHP and CRHR.

Cronin Hall is located along the west edge of the campus of St. Mary's College High School in the City of Albany in
Alameda County. The school campus is also partially in Berkeley, and the school uses a Berkeley street address. The
building was constructed in two phases: the northernmost two classrooms (Photograph 1) were a stand-alone, wood-frame
building completed in 1952; the remainder of the building (Photograph 3) was added in 1959. This extension of the
original portion is also of wood-frame construction and has a basement for most of its length. The entire building rests on a
reinforced concrete foundation and concrete footings and is rectangular with a north-south alignment and a dogleg extension
at the southwest end. (See Continuation Sheet.)

Cronin Hall on the Saint Mary's College High School at 1294 Albina Avenue has been evaluated in accordance
with Section 15064.5(a)(2)-(3) of the CEQA Guidelines outlined in Section 5024.1 of the California Public
Resources Code. The building lacks significance and therefore does not appear to meet the criteria for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or California Register of Historic Resources (CRHR) and
therefore does not appear to be a historical resource for the purposes of CEQA. (See Continuation Sheet.)

B10. Significance

Historical Overview

Saint Mary's College High School is located in the southeast corner of the City of Albany at 1294 Albina Avenue. The
campus slightly straddles the line between Albany and the City of Berkeley which runs along Codornices Creek; however,
St. Joseph's Hall is located on the Albany side of the boundary. The De La Salle Christian Brothers first occupied the site in
1903 and still operate SMCHS. All of the buildings that currently comprise the school were constructed after World War II.
The following discussion describes the history of Saint Mary's College High School from its 1863 founding in San
Francisco to its history at the current location. Please reference the sketch map in Figure 2 for the current locations of the
buildings on the campus.

Alameda County and Albany History

The City of Albany in Alameda County occupies the northern portion of what was once an expansive land grant called
Rancho San Antonio. The grant encompassed what is now Berkeley, Albany, Emeryville, Piedmont, and a portion of San
Leandro, and reached from the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay to crest of the Contra Costa hills. The last Spanish
Governor of California, Pablo Vicente de Sola, awarded a land grant of 43,000 acres to distinguished Spanish soldier Don
Luis Maria Peralta in 1820. Don Luis never lived on the rancho and in 1842, two decades after Mexico won its
independence from Spain, he divided the land equally between his four sons. Don Luis gave his son Domingo Peralta the
northern end of the grant, which now encompasses Albany and Berkeley. In 1849, Peralta's pastoral rancho lifestyle
changed dramatically with the Gold Rush.2

Settlers arriving with the Gold Rush quickly realized the value of Domingo Peralta's land and, by the time California
achieved statehood in 1850, many of those who did not gravitate to the gold mines purchased or illegally squatted on the

majority of what was formerly Peralta land. In 1853, California Governor Bigler authorized the creation of Alameda
County. The new county consisted of 760 square miles of land and 80 square miles of water.3

Early industrial development in the area began during the 1860s. The Civil War and the transcontinental railroad claimed
most of the gunpowder produced in the east. However, enterprising businessmen in Albany began producing gunpowder to
supplement the nation's supply, which became one of the principal industries in this portion of the East Bay that led to its
further development. In 1879, the Giant Gunpowder Company (which later became the Judson and Sheppard Chemical
Works) built a plant at Fleming Point on the current site of Golden Gate Fields racetrack. The plant closed in 1892 after
several deadly explosions. The Judson Dynamite and Powder Company followed with an explosives plant on the west slope
of Albany hill in 1898. It too suffered a series of deadly explosions and closed in 1905, ending the presence of the
explosives industry in Albany. The West Coast Kalsomine Company opened a shop on the west slope of Cerrito Hill that
produced the paints used on the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition buildings in San Francisco.4

An important contributing factor to the settlement of what became Albany was the development of the University of
California in Berkeley. In 1868, the state of California designated the College of California, situated on the northwestern
portion of the former Rancho San Antonio, as the University of California. As the university grew, the surrounding area
provided housing, stores, and restaurants for the influx of students and professors.5

Settlement and development in the East Bay received another boost as refugees fled San Francisco following the 1906
earthquake and fires. Real estate companies in northern Alameda County promoted the undeveloped area in the East Bay as
a safer alternative to San Francisco. The population grew drastically in established cities like Berkeley following the
earthquake. Berkeley's population increased from approximately 13,000 to 40,000 between 1900 and 1910. During this
period, a conflict between the citizens of Berkeley and their neighbors led to the incorporation of the City of Albany. For
many years, Berkeley dumped its garbage in the area around San Pablo Avenue in an area called Ocean View. Citizens in
that area united to halt the dumping and to incorporate the town of Ocean View in 1908. Voters changed the name of the
new town to Albany in 1909. In 1927, Albany adopted its first official charter and the town formed its own school district in
1929.6 Albany's population expanded from 911 in 1910 to over 14,000 in 1945 largely because of employment
opportunities provided by war-related industries. The federal government subsidized housing projects in the Albany area for
the families of military personnel stationed in the Bay Area and employees of the Richmond shipyards.7

History of Saint Mary's College High School

Saint Mary's College High School began as part of Saint Mary's College in San Francisco. Archbishop Joseph Sadoc
Alemany established the college in the 1860s to bolster Catholic education in the area. He lobbied for the De La Salle
Christian Brothers, a respected teaching order, to come to California and administer the school, but the organization decided
its American resources were too thin and could not be spared. In 1867, Alemany traveled to Rome and appealed to the Pope,

who granted his support to the plan. The following year, a group of Christian Brothers made the journey to the West Coast
and took control of Saint Mary's College.8

History of the Christian Brothers, San Francisco District

In San Francisco, the Christian Brothers took over a school with both day and boarding students ranging from primary to
university levels, which was a common arrangement at the time. The school succeeded in tripling the number of students in
a single year and increased its relationship with "feeder schools" in the area, including Saint Joseph's Academy in Oakland,
a grammar school founded in 1870. The San Francisco District of Christian Brothers also established or operated schools in
other parts of California (Sacramento, Oakland, Santa Barbara, San Rafael, and Santa Cruz) as well as Oregon and
Washington. These developments enabled Saint Mary's College to purchase land in Oakland, where they constructed a
large brick building to house the college and high school. The Christian Brothers moved St. Mary's College and High
School to the new brick building in Oakland in 1889. Fires nearly destroyed the Oakland facility in 1894 and 1918, but the
school rebuilt and continued in Oakland until 1927, when the high school and college split and relocated to Peralta Park and
Moraga, respectively.9

Peralta Park and the Christian Brothers

As mentioned above, squatters became a problem on Jose Domingo Peralta's property in Alameda County after the Gold
Rush. Peralta sold much of his holdings by 1853, and his heirs split the remaining land after his death in 1865. Portions of
the property changed owners multiple times before the 1880s, including 60 acres around Codornices Creek that later became
Peralta Park and the home of SMCHS. In 1887, Maurice B. Curtis purchased these 60 acres with plans to sell lots for a
residential subdivision. Curtis, a very popular actor, also constructed a grand hotel to serve as a retirement home for his
colleagues in the theater. The Peralta Park Hotel was completed and opened in 1891. The 60-room hotel was an extravagant
and large building with multiple spires and towers. The subdivision that surrounded the hotel became a desirable
neighborhood, and several large homes were constructed on the tree-lined lots. Despite the success of the subdivision, the
hotel quickly outdistanced its owner's finances, and Curtis sold the property to cover his debts. The hotel became Peralta
Hall and served as a boarding school, nightclub, and candy factory before the Christian Brothers purchased the property and
building in 1903.10

Saint Mary's College High School in Peralta Park

The Christian Brothers moved St. Joseph's Academy from Oakland to Peralta Hall in Peralta Park in 1903, when the area
was all still part of Berkeley. The large hotel building, now called Peralta Hall, offered much better facilities than the poor
conditions of their building in Oakland. Deteriorating facilities at the college and high school building in Oakland also
motivated the Brothers to consider relocating those students. As mentioned above, the college moved to new facilities in
Moraga in 1927. At the same time, the Christian Brothers commissioned a new three-story building at Peralta Park, De La
Salle Hall, to provide classrooms for the high school, and instruction began at the new location in 1927. Peralta Hall
continued to house St. Joseph's Academy and served as a dormitory for boarding students and brothers.11

By the 1940s, the deteriorating condition of Peralta Hall prompted plans for new campus buildings. In 1946, those plans
became more pressing after a fire swept through the upper portion of the old hotel. After the fire, the top two stories were
determined structurally unsound and were removed for the safety of the students, but the lower floors remained in service as
the school library and dormitory. New construction on the Peralta Park campus began in the 1940s and continued over the
next decade as demand for updated facilities grew. One of the new buildings, constructed in 1952, was the first phase of
Cronin Hall, located next to the 1948 gymnasium and designed by San Francisco architect Vincent Buckley.12 In 1959,
seismic inadequacies forced the school to demolish the remaining portion of Peralta Hall. In the same year, Cronin Hall was
expanded to the south along the western border of the campus, adding more classroom space for the high school.13 The
oblique aerial photo below (Photograph 2) shows the campus around 1959, following the demolition of Peralta Hall and
construction of Cronin Hall's extension. The gymnasium, with its prominent façade pilasters, is situated north of St.
Joseph's Hall and to the east of Cronin Hall. The "L" shaped De La Salle Hall was prominently situated, at this time, on the
east side of campus south of the sports field and north of Vellesian Hall.

After 1960 and over the next several decades, changes continued at the SMCHS campus. With its limited space on its
Peralta Park property, the school remodeled several buildings, built additions, altered the landscape features, used and then
replaced temporary buildings, and built new buildings in much of the remaining open space on campus. The school
concentrated most of its development on the west side of campus, even after De La Salle Hall was demolished. In 1969, the
grammar boarding school, St. Joseph's Academy, relocated to the Christian Brothers' district headquarters at Mont La Salle
in Napa, leaving the entire Peralta Park campus to the high school. In order to accommodate the school's anticipated needs

over the next decades, the Christian Brothers commissioned and instituted a master plan in the early 1970s. De La Salle Hall
was demolished in 1973 because of seismic deficiencies, so much of the master plan was devoted to making up for the lost
space. New buildings included a new cafeteria and gymnasium expansion in 1976 and a new Brothers' Residence in 1978.
In the last twenty years, changes have continued at SMCHS. The school became co-educational in 1995 and changed to an
all day-student population. The campus has continued to evolve with alterations to buildings and the replacement of
temporary classrooms with permanent classroom buildings in 1986 and 2002. The current master plan for the campus
recommends further measures intended to meet the evolving needs of Saint Mary's College High School, including the
renovation of Cronin Hall.14

The various periods of construction and development led to a variety of architectural expressions on campus, with little
apparent architectural continuity over time. The architecture of the older buildings on campus ranges from the utilitarian
design of Vellesian Hall to the Moderne style of the older portion of the gymnasium and mid-twentieth century
Contemporary style of St. Joseph's Hall. Cronin Hall is generally a utilitarian style building that incorporates the exterior
hallway design common to California schools built in the 1950s.

Discussion of Potential Significance

Cronin Hall does not appear to meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP or CRHR.15

Under Criteria A (1), Cronin Hall does not appear to be significant because it lacks important associations with events that
have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of local and regional history. SMCHS is associated with the
development of Christian Brothers Catholic education in California, which began in the 1860s. SMCHS was one of many
California schools administered by the Christian Brothers and includes buildings from a period after the Catholic education
system was well established in the San Francisco Bay Area. Although the Peralta Park campus has association with
Christian Brothers education as early as 1903, Cronin Hall dates to 1952 (and enlarged in 1959) and illustrates the
incremental improvements that were made to the campus as its older facilities deteriorated. While Cronin Hall contributed
to the development of SMCHS, it cannot be associated with the important early education efforts of the Christian Brothers in
the San Francisco Bay Area. Furthermore, the building is not individually importantly associated with trends or events that
are significant to local, regional, state, or national history.

Under Criteria B (2), Cronin Hall does not appear to be significant for its association with the lives of persons important to
local, California, or national history.

Under Criteria C (3), Cronin Hall does not appear to be significant as an important example of a type, period, or method of
construction; nor does it appear to be the work of a master artist or craftsman or possess high artistic values. As discussed
above, Vellesian Hall has a utilitarian design with an exterior hallway design common to school buildings in California
constructed in the 1950s. The building is also not the work of a master. San Francisco architect Vincent Buckley designed
the building. Early in his career, Buckley was a draftsman with John J. Foley who did work for the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese, including Star of the Sea Church (1928) and Grammar School (1931) in Richmond. In the 1920s, Buckley was
in the firm Griewank & Buckley, construction engineers, and he worked with architect H.A. Minton who also did work for
the Archdiocese. In the 1950s, Buckley designed St. Ambrose Catholic Church in Berkeley, the Shrine of St. Therese in

Fresno, and Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Oakland. In spite of these commissions, the historic record does not provide
evidence of Vincent Buckley's significance as an architect.16

Cronin Hall does not appear to be significant under Criteria D (4) because this criterion is usually used to evaluate historic
sites and archaeological resources. Although buildings and structures can occasionally be recognized for the important
information they might yield regarding historic construction or technologies, Cronin Hall is a building type that is well
documented and is not a principal source of important information in this regard.

Cronin Hall began as a small building with two classrooms before the 1959 expansion to its current size. The building
retains integrity to its 1959 construction; however, it lacks historic significance and thus does not appear to meet the criteria
for listing in the NRHP.

Furthermore, if this building was eligible for listing in the NRHP, its significance would need to meet the NRHP Criteria
Consideration A for Religious Properties because it was constructed by and is presently owned by a religious institution, the
Christian Brothers. Cronin Hall does not meet the standards established by Criteria Consideration A because it does not
possess architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance.

Cronin Hall at 1294 Albina Avenue has been evaluated in accordance with Section 15064.5(a)(2)-(3) of the CEQA
Guidelines using the criteria outlined in Section 5024.1 of the California Public Resources Code. It does not appear to meet
the criteria for listing in the NRHP and CRHR.

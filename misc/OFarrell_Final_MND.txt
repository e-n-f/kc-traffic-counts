                                                            Introduction and Overview

Overview
     The San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD or District), as the lead agency under the California
     Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), has prepared this Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration
     (IS/MND) to evaluate the potential environmental consequences associated with the O'Farrell
     Community School Modernization and New High School Project (Project). The Project consists of the
     repair and renovation of an existing community school's facilities, construction of a new high school,
     and development of a joint-use playfields site. Implementation of the Project would require
     approval by the SDUSD Board. As part of the District's discretionary review process, the Project is
     required to undergo an environmental review in accordance with CEQA.



CEQA Requirements
     The Project is subject to the requirements of CEQA. Per CEQA requirements (Public Resources Code
     [PRC], Division 13, Sections 21000­21177) and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of
     Regulations [CCR], Title 14, Sections 15000­15387), an Initial Study/Environmental Checklist Form
     was prepared to provide the basis for deciding whether to prepare an Environmental Impact Report
     (EIR), a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND), or a Negative Declaration (ND) for the Project. As
     provided in CEQA Section 15070 (CCR Title 14), an MND may be prepared for a project subject to
     CEQA when an Initial Study has identified potentially significant effects on the environment, but
     when revisions to the project have been made so that no significant effect on the environment would
     result from project implementation. Based on the findings of the Initial Study, the District has
     determined that preparation of the IS/MND is the appropriate method to present environmental
     review of the Project in compliance with CEQA. Chapter 3 of this IS/MND contains the Initial
     Study/Environmental Checklist Form.



Impact Terminology
     The following terminology is used to describe the level of significance of impacts:
     ·    A finding of no impact is appropriate if the analysis concludes that a project would not affect the
          particular topic area in any way.
     ·    An impact is considered less than significant if the analysis concludes that a project would cause
          no substantial adverse change to the environment and requires no mitigation.
     ·    An impact is considered less than significant with mitigation incorporated if the analysis
          concludes that a project would cause no substantial adverse change to the environment with the
          inclusion of environmental commitments or other enforceable measures that have been agreed
          to by the applicant.

     ·     An impact is considered potentially significant if the analysis concludes that a project could have
           a substantial adverse effect on the environment. For the proposed Project, no impacts were
           determined to be potentially significant.



Scope of the IS/MND

Mitigation
     Mitigation measures have been developed by the District and incorporated into the Project design to
     reduce potentially significant impacts to less-than-significant levels. These measures are discussed
     in Chapter 3, Initial Study/Environmental Checklist Form, of this document and further detail of
     each measure is provided in a separate document prepared for this Project called the Mitigation
     Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP) for the O'Farrell Community School Modernization and
     New High School Project.

Project Overview
     The O'Farrell Community School Modernization and New School Project consists of modernization
     improvements to the O'Farrell Community School, construction of a new high school, and
     redevelopment of a 2-acre joint-use athletic playfields site.

     The new 480 student high school would be operated as a charter school. The high school would be
     built on District property; therefore, as lead agency under CEQA, the District is responsible for
     completing the environmental review for implementation of this feature of the Project.

     Following the ratification of Proposition S (Prop S)--the San Diego Repair and Safety Measure for
     the repair and renovation of district school facilities--the Project would employ bond funds to
     improve the school facilities at O'Farrell Community School. As mandated, Prop S funds must be
     used for projects listed in the bond language placed before voters, and many of the facilities at this
     school were identified for renovations, repairs, and/or upgrades. Proposed Project improvements
     consist of various upgrades to classrooms and recreational facilities including redevelopment of the
     2-acre turf playfields site proposed for joint-use between the District and the City of San Diego.
     Additionally, the Project includes development of a new high school directly east of the O'Farrell
     Community School and within the District's property.



Project Location
     The Project would occur within District-owned property located in the City of San Diego (see
     Figure 1). Specifically, the Project site is bordered to the north by Benson Avenue, to the west by
     61st Street, to the south by Skyline Drive, and to the east by single-family residences. The existing
     onsite community school (O'Farrell Community School) is located at 6130 Skyline Drive, and is
     situated within the southwestern portion of the Project site. The new high school would be located
     adjacent to and east of the existing school, within the site's southeastern corner. The site for the
     proposed joint-use turf playfields is directly north of the existing community school facility. Figure 2
     shows the location of these Project elements.



Environmental Setting
     Currently the Project site includes the O'Farrell Community School and two large undeveloped
     lots--one located to the east of the school, the other to the north. The vacant lot to the east of the
     school is proposed for construction of the new high school. The proposed joint-use turf playfields
     would be located within the undeveloped lot to the north of the existing school.

     The existing onsite school was opened in 1960 and serves grades 6 through 9, with current
     enrollment at approximately 916 students (Ed-Data 2013). This facility includes classrooms,

     administration buildings, service buildings, storage buildings, utility buildings, athletic facilities, and
     asphalt-paved parking lots.

     Surrounding land uses are predominantly single-family residential with the exception of the
     Bayview Baptist Church, which is located directly north of the site across Benson Avenue. Regional
     access to the site is generally provided by Interstate (I-) 805 or State Route (SR-) 94, and local access
     is provided by Skyline Drive and 61st Street.



Proposed Project Elements
     As analyzed in this IS/MND, the Project is separated into three Project elements. These comprise the
     Prop S modernization improvements for the existing O'Farrell Community School, construction of a
     new high school, and development of a 2-acre joint-use playfields site. Each of these Project
     elements is described below.

O'Farrell Community School Modernization Improvements
     Supported by bond funds under Prop S, modernization improvements are proposed for the existing
     community school to benefit student health, safety, and security; upgrade school accessibility and
     facilitate code compliance; and perform needed building systems repairs and replacements. None of
     the improvements would accommodate an increase in the student capacity of the school. A list of the
     O'Farrell Community School improvements is provided below.

Student Health, Safety, and Security
     ·     Installation of new entry gates throughout campus and a 6-foot fence at new relocatables
           (portable classrooms).

     ·     Installation of six (6) 10-foot exterior light poles.

     ·     Installation of new signal and communication system in all buildings and new relocatables.

     ·     Removal of hazardous materials at exterior stucco and plaster where modifications to windows
           take place.

     ·     Installation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units in applicable buildings.
           This improvement includes installation of new windows, structural upgrades to existing
           buildings, installation of energy management system (EMS) controls, and work on exposed
           ducts.

     ·     Installation of fire alarms to new devices required for upgrade of HVAC units.

School Accessibility and Code Compliance Upgrades
     ·     Renovation of restrooms in applicable buildings per code.

     ·     Modifications to existing paving where existing portables are to be removed, as well as areas for
           new modulars. Various renovations to parking areas including parking re-striping and signage,

     Construction of a new high school is proposed on vacant District property adjacent to and east of the
     existing O'Farrell Community School. The new school would function as a separate campus within
     the Project site, serving grades 9 through 12, and would be sufficient to accommodate 480 students.
     Figure 3 provides a site plan of the new high school. Construction of the school would add eight (8)
     new modular buildings and a small gymnasium. Development of the school would also comprise
     landscaping, including new trees, and stormwater retention ponds. Areas planned for landscaping
     are located adjacent to or near the boundaries of the property and would not be intended for
     student use. Also, 74 general parking spaces and 5 handicapped parking spaces would be included
     with development of the new high school, and an access road to the parking lot would connect to the
     existing O'Farrell Community School's driveway along Skyline Drive. The access road would require
     some minor grading in the southeast portion of the property.

New Joint-Use Playfields
     The District proposes to join with the City of San Diego to co-fund redevelopment of a site for
     athletic playfields. The proposed site is currently owned by the District and located just north of the
     existing O'Farrell Community School. Athletic fields are currently located on this site, and
     implementation of the new joint-use playfields would renovate these existing uses. The new
     playfields site would cover approximately 2 acres, incorporate new turf playfields, and include
     irrigation. No stadium-type lighting is proposed at the fields.



Discretionary Approvals Required
     The District is the lead agency under CEQA and is responsible for the permitting of the joint-use field
     and modernization portions of the Project. The District would also need the approval of compliance
     with the Office of the Division of State Architect.

     The new school would be a charter high school. The charter for the school would be responsible for
     obtaining any clearances from the Division of State Architect or any local agencies for the
     construction of the project. The high school would be built on District property; therefore, as lead
     agency under CEQA, the District is responsible for completing the environmental review for
     implementation of the school.

exempt this project from such land use controls. General Plan and zoning information is therefore provided only for
reference, as they will not apply to the property.

Environmental Factors Potentially Affected
     The environmental factors checked below would potentially be affected by this project (i.e., the
     proposed Project would involve at least one impact that is a "Potentially Significant Impact"), as
     indicated by the checklist on the following pages.

            Aesthetics                     Agriculture and Forest                    Air Quality
                                           Resources

Determination
     On the basis of this initial evaluation:
          I find that the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on the environment, and a
          NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.
          I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, there
          will not be a significant effect in this case because revisions to the project have been made by or
          agreed to by the project proponent. A MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.
          I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment, and an
          ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required.
          I find that the proposed project MAY have an impact on the environment that is "potentially
          significant" or "potentially significant unless mitigated" but at least one effect (1) has been
          adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable legal standards and (2) has
          been addressed by mitigation measures based on the earlier analysis, as described on attached
          sheets. An ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required, but it must analyze only the effects that
          remain to be addressed.
          I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment,
          because all potentially significant effects (a) have been analyzed adequately in an earlier
          ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT or NEGATIVE DECLARATION pursuant to applicable
          standards, and (b) have been avoided or mitigated pursuant to that earlier ENVIRONMENTAL
          IMPACT REPORT or NEGATIVE DECLARATION, including revisions or mitigation measures that
          are imposed upon the project, nothing further is required.

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
     1. A brief explanation is required for all answers except "No Impact" answers that are adequately
        supported by the information sources a lead agency cites in the parentheses following each question.
        A "No Impact" answer is adequately supported if the referenced information sources show that the
        impact simply does not apply to projects like the one involved (e.g., the project falls outside a fault
        rupture zone). A "No Impact" answer should be explained if it is based on project-specific factors as
        well as general standards (e.g., the project will not expose sensitive receptors to pollutants, based on
        a project-specific screening analysis).
     2. All answers must take account of the whole action involved, including off-site as well as on-site,
        cumulative as well as project-level, indirect as well as direct, and construction as well as operational
        impacts.
     3. Once the lead agency has determined that a particular physical impact may occur, the checklist
        answers must indicate whether the impact is potentially significant, less than significant with
        mitigation, or less than significant. "Potentially Significant Impact" is appropriate if there is
        substantial evidence that an effect may be significant. If there are one or more "Potentially Significant
        Impact" entries when the determination is made, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required.
     4. "Less than Significant with Mitigation Incorporated" applies when the incorporation of mitigation
        measures has reduced an effect from a "Potentially Significant Impact" to a "Less-than-Significant
        Impact." The lead agency must describe the mitigation measures and briefly explain how they reduce
        the effect to a less-than-significant level. (Mitigation measures from Section XVII, "Earlier Analyses,"
        may be cross-referenced.)
     5. Earlier analyses may be used if, pursuant to tiering, program EIR, or other CEQA process, an effect
        has been adequately analyzed in an earlier EIR or negative declaration [Section 15063(c)(3)(D)]. In
        this case, a brief discussion should identify the following:
           a.   Earlier Analysis Used. Identify and state where earlier analyses are available for review.
           b. Impacts Adequately Addressed. Identify which effects from the above checklist were within the
              scope of and adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable legal standards
              and state whether such effects were addressed by mitigation measures based on the earlier
              analysis.
           c.   Mitigation Measures. For effects that are "Less than Significant with Mitigation Incorporated,"
                describe the mitigation measures that were incorporated or refined from the earlier document
                and the extent to which they address site-specific conditions for the project.
     6. Lead agencies are encouraged to incorporate into the checklist references to information sources for
        potential impacts (e.g., general plans, zoning ordinances). Reference to a previously prepared or
        outside document should, when appropriate, include a reference to the page or pages where the
        statement is substantiated.
     7. Supporting Information Sources: A source list should be attached, and other sources used or
        individuals contacted should be cited in the discussion.
     8. This is only a suggested form, and lead agencies are free to use different formats; however, lead
        agencies should normally address the questions from this checklist that are relevant to a project's
        environmental effects in whatever format is selected.
     9. The explanation of each issue should identify:
           a.   the significance criteria or threshold, if any, used to evaluate each question; and
           b. the mitigation measure identified, if any, to reduce the impact to a less-than-significant level.

    character or quality of the site and its
    surroundings?

    glare that would adversely affect daytime or
    nighttime views in the area?


I. a & b) No Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Improvements proposed for the existing school would not substantially affect a scenic vista or
     damage scenic resources along a scenic highway because there are no scenic vistas or scenic
     highways within the vicinity or in the greater surrounding areas of the existing school. All Project
     improvements would occur within existing District property, which is relatively flat and surrounded
     by residential development. Eligible State Scenic Highways within the City and County of San Diego
     include portions of SR-163 and SR-125; however, neither is in the vicinity of the existing school
     (Caltrans 2013). Therefore, no impact associated with these issues would occur.

     New High School

     No scenic vistas or scenic highways occur within the vicinity or in the greater surrounding areas of
     the new high school site; therefore, no impact on visual resources would occur with construction of
     the high school. The site is relatively flat and surrounded by an urban environment. In addition, as
     shown in Figure 2, the new high school would be a visual extension of the existing community school
     campus facilities. Within the City and County of San Diego, portions of SR-163 and SR-125 are
     eligible State Scenic Highways; however, neither is in the vicinity of the proposed site (Caltrans
     2013). Therefore, no impact associated with these issues would occur.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not damage scenic resources along a
     scenic highway or impact a scenic vista. Portions of SR-163 and SR-125 are eligible State Scenic
     Highways within the City and County of San Diego; however, neither of these is in the vicinity of the
     proposed playfields site. Further, the site is flat and surrounded by residential development and,
     therefore, would not disrupt a scenic vista. In addition no new lighting is proposed at the field.
     Therefore, no impact would occur.

I. c) No Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     The school improvements are not anticipated to degrade the existing visual character or quality of
     the proposed site or the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Instead, improvements are planned
     to improve the look and function of the existing school facilities by replacing older structures with
     newer and more efficient buildings and infrastructure. Overall, the appearance of the existing onsite
     uses would be improved, thus improving the surrounding neighborhood character as well.
     Therefore, impacts associated with this issue would not occur.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not degrade the existing visual character or quality of
     the site because it would represent an extension of the visual character of the school uses that
     currently exist on the property. Additionally, development of the new high school would improve
     the appearance of the site by planting new trees and incorporating other types of landscaping to
     create an aesthetically pleasing facility. Therefore, the new facility would improve the overall
     appearance of the property, thus improving the character of the surrounding neighborhood as well.
     No impact associated with this issue would occur.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the 2-acre turf playfields would not degrade the existing visual character or
     quality of the site. The site is currently a vacant dirt lot used for athletic activities within the
     District's property. Redevelopment of the site would improve its condition by providing a new
     interactive and inviting facility on a currently underutilized site. In addition, no new lighting is
     proposed at the field other than for security purposes. Therefore, no impacts associated with this
     issue would occur.

I. d) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     The school improvements would not create a new source of substantial light or glare. Improved
     security lighting is proposed within the campus through installation of six 10-foot exterior light
     poles, which would be shielded and focus light downward to avoid light trespass (light being cast
     where it is not wanted or needed). The improved lighting would therefore not provide a substantial
     source of light that would adversely affect daytime or nighttime views in the area. Impacts would be
     less than significant.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not create a new source of substantial light or glare
     because new lighting would incorporate light shielding features and focus light downward to avoid
     light trespass. Therefore, impacts associated with this issue would be less than significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new playfields site would not create a new source of substantial light or glare.
     Security lighting is planned for the joint-use field, but no stadium-type lighting is proposed.
     Therefore, no significant impacts would occur.

 In determining whether impacts on agricultural
 resources are significant environmental effects,
 lead agencies may refer to the California
 Agricultural Land Evaluation and Site Assessment
 Model (1997) prepared by the California
 Department of Conservation as an optional model
 to use in assessing impacts on agriculture and
 farmland. In determining whether impacts to
 forest resources, including timberland, are
 significant environmental effects, lead agencies
 may refer to information compiled by the
 California Department of Forestry and Fire
 Protection regarding the state's inventory of forest
 land, including the Forest and Range Assessment
 Project, the Forest Legacy Assessment project, and
 forest carbon measurement methodology provided
 in Forest Protocols adopted by the California Air
 Resources Board. Would the project:
 a. Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or
      Farmland of Statewide Importance
      (Farmland), as shown on the maps prepared
      pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and
      Monitoring Program of the California
      Resources Agency, to non-agricultural use?
 b. Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural
      use or conflict with a Williamson Act contract?
 c. Conflict with existing zoning for, or cause
      rezoning of, forest land (as defined in Public
      Resources Code section 12220(g)),
      timberland (as defined by Public Resources
      Code section 4526), or timberland zoned
      Timberland Production (as defined by
      Government Code section 51104(g))?
 d. Result in the loss of forest land or conversion
      of forest land to non-forest use?
 e. Involve other changes in the existing
      environment which, due to their location or
      nature, could result in conversion of Farmland
      to non-agricultural use or conversion of forest
      land to non-forest use?


II. a ­ e) No Impact.

     Community School Improvements/New High School/New Joint-Use Playfields

     No elements of the Project would result in impacts on agriculture or forest resources. The existing
     school site is in a densely urbanized area where there are no farmlands or forest resources.

     According to the California Department of Conservation San Diego County Important Farmland 2008
     map (California Department of Conservation 2008), the Project site is classified as "urban and built-
     up land," which does not contain any agricultural uses or areas designated Prime Farmland, Unique
     Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance. Furthermore, there are no Williamson Act
     contracts or forest lands in the project vicinity (California Department of Conservation 2013).
     Therefore, there would be no impact.

 When available, the significance criteria
 established by the applicable air quality
 management or air pollution control district may
 be relied upon to make the following
 determinations. Would the project:
 a. Conflict with or obstruct implementation of
      the applicable air quality plan?
 b. Violate any air quality standard or contribute
      substantially to an existing or projected air
      quality violation?
 c. Result in a cumulatively considerable net
      increase of any criteria pollutant for which the
      project region is a nonattainment area for an
      applicable federal or state ambient air quality
      standard (including releasing emissions that
      exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
      precursors)?
 d. Expose sensitive receptors to substantial
      pollutant concentrations?
 e. Create objectionable odors affecting a
      substantial number of people?


III. a) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not conflict with or obstruct implementation of
     any applicable air quality plan. San Diego County is currently designated a nonattainment area for
     the Federal 8-hour ozone standard and the State ozone (O3), Respirable Particulate Matter (PM10),
     and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) standards. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Strategy (RAQS)
     is the region's plan for improving air quality and attaining the Federal and State air quality
     standards. The RAQS relies on information from the California Air Resources Board (ARB) and the
     San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) to project future emissions and determine
     appropriate emissions reduction strategies. The San Diego Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD)
     has also adopted a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone, as well as measures to help attain the
     particulate matter California Ambient Air Quality Standards (PM CAAQS).

     A project is deemed inconsistent with air quality plans if it would result in population and/or
     employment growth that exceeds estimates used to develop applicable air quality plans, which, in
     turn, would generate emissions not accounted for in the regional emissions budgets. Therefore, this
     Project element was evaluated to determine if it is consistent with the land use designations and
     growth anticipated in the RAQS and ozone SIP prepared for the San Diego region.

     During construction, the school improvements would include replacement of old portable
     classrooms with new modular buildings, installation of new gates and fences, and various facility

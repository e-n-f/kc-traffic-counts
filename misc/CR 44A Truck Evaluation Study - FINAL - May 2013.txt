INTRODUCTION
Traffic Engineering Data Solutions, Inc. (TEDS) was retained on behalf of Lake County to
conduct a truck evaluation and speed study on County Road 44/County Road 44A in central
Lake County. County Road 44/County Road 44A spans approximately 12.5 miles between
State Road 19 in Eustis and State Road 44 in eastern Lake County. A general location map of
the study roadway is provided as Figure 1.
The analysis methods used in completing this study are consistent with the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and the Florida Department of Transportation's (FDOT)
Manual on Uniform Traffic Studies (MUTS). The remainder of this report documents existing
conditions, vehicle classification counts, vehicular speeds, crash analysis, and
recommendations.

   Existing Annual Average Daily Traffic Volumes (AADTs)
   Six (6) 48-hour vehicle classification counts were conducted for this study including two (2) on
   County Road 44 between State Road 19 and the Eustis By-Pass, three (3) on County Road
   44A between County Road 439 and State Road 44, and one (1) along State Road 44 east of
   County Road 439. The volumes from these 48-hour counts were adjusted to Annual Average
   Daily Traffic (AADT) by applying a peak-season factor of 0.94 as obtained from FDOT's Peak
   Season Factor Category Report. The conversion of a raw traffic count to AADT is to account
   for variations in traffic counts resulting from seasonal effects.
   In addition to the 48-hour classification counts that were conducted, year 2012 AADT's were
   also obtained from Lake County and the Florida Department of Transportation for additional
   roadway segments. The existing AADT's are summarized in Table 2 and Figure 2. Based on
   a review of the existing AADT information, it can be seen that the AADT on County Road
   44/County Road 44A just east of State Road 19 is 9,430 vehicles per day (vpd) and decreases
   to 1,090 vpd just west of State Road 44. Printouts of the 48-hour classification counts, Lake
   County counts, and FDOT counts as well as FDOT's Peak Season Factor Category Report are
   provided in the Appendix.

Historical Traffic Data
Historical AADT's were also obtained for all of the roadway segments. Using the historical
AADT information, historical annual growth rates were calculated for each roadway using
FDOT's historical trends spreadsheet. For this analysis, a 5-year and 10-year historical annual
growth was calculated where data was available. The historical AADT's and the resulting
historical annual growth rates are summarized in Table 2 and Figure 2.
As can be seen from Table 2, the 5-year historical annual growth rate on County Road
44/County Road 44A ranged from -4.3% to 0.6% per year. The 10-year historical annual
growth rate on County Road 44/County Road 44A ranged from -1.9% to -4.7%. Thus, it can
be concluded that the traffic volumes on County Road 44/County Road 44A between State
Road 19 and State Road 44 have decreased with a couple of exceptions where a marginal
increase was noted in the five-year rates.
Printouts of the historical data and historical trends spreadsheets are provided in the
Appendix.
Truck Traffic
Based on the 48-hour classification counts, the vehicle mix along County Road 44/County
Road 44A between State Road 19 and State Road 44 was identified. The classification counts
separate the vehicles into 15 different categories. The truck information was separated into
two different categories; 1) single unit trucks such a delivery trucks (class 5 to 7) and 2) tractor-
trailer trucks (class 8 to 15). The percentage and volume of single-unit and tractor-trailer
trucks at each of the count locations is summarized in Figure 3. Included in the Appendix is a
page from FDOT's Project Traffic Forecasting Handbook, 2012, which provides a breakdown
of the different vehicle classifications.
Based on a review of Figure 3, it can be seen that single-unit trucks account for approximately
2.4% to 4.3% of the total traffic on County Road 44/County Road 44A between State Road 19
and State Road 44. Just east of State Road 19 there are more than 200 single-unit trucks per
day, decreasing by nearly 50% to just over 100 trucks per day east of County Road 439, and
dropping further to nearly 50 trucks per day just west of State Road 44.
Relative to tractor-trailer trucks, they account for approximately 3.5% to 5.6% of the total traffic
on County Road 44/County Road 44A between State Road 19 and State Road 44 (see Figure
3). Just east of State Road 19 there are approximately 330 tractor-trailer trucks per day,
decreasing by 60% to approximately 130 trucks per day east of County Road 439, and
dropping further to 61 trucks per day just west of State Road 44.
In addition to the 48-hour classification counts, eight-hour manual turning movement counts
were conducted at the County Road 44/County Road 44A and County Road 44A/State Road
44 intersections. In focusing on the County Road 44/County Road 44A intersection, more than
60% of the truck traffic approaching the intersection turned right (south) onto southbound
County Road 44 with the remaining trucks continuing eastbound on County Road 44A. Of the
westbound traffic departing the intersection, more than 60% of the traffic is from northbound on
the Eustis Bypass (County Road 44) with the balance from the westbound through movement
from County Road 44A.

When focusing on the County Road 44A/State Road 44 intersection, based on the eight-hour
turning movement count, approximately 25% of the truck volumes on State Road 44, northeast
of County Road 44A, are to/from County Road 44A. The remaining 75% of the truck volumes
are to/from State Road 44 southwest of County Road 44A.
Historical truck data is not available on County Road 44/County Road 44A but it is available
from an FDOT continuous count station on East Orange Avenue east of the Eustis Bypass
(County Road 44). Based on a review of this data (see Table 2) which shows truck traffic
ranging from approximately 750 to 800 vpd over the past four (4) years, it can be seen that
there has been no growth in single-unit or tractor-trailer truck traffic between 2009 and 2012.
This same data also shows that tractor-trailer trucks have comprised 3.70% to 3.97% of the
traffic. Based on Figure 3, this composition of traffic is similar to that found on County Road
44/County Road 44A ranging from 3.5% to 3.9% with the exception of just west of State Road
44 where tractor-trailer trucks make up 5.6% of the traffic. From a volume perspective, on
County Road 44A between County Road 439 and County Road 437 there were 123 tractor-
trailer trucks per day. On State Road 44, east of County Road 439, there were 227 tractor-
trailer trucks per day, more than 80% than on County Road 44A.
Printouts showing the historical truck data on State Road 44 are provided in the Appendix.
Speed Data
Speed data was obtained at three (3) locations along the study corridor; on County Road 44
approximately 3,000 feet east of State Road 19, on County Road 44A approximately 2,000 feet
west of East Lake Seneca Road, and on County Road 44A approximately 1.2 miles west of
State Road 44 (see Figure 4). The speed data for the first location was obtained utilizing 48-
hour tube counts, using a radar gun for calibration purposes. The data for the second location
was obtained using both tube counts and radar data. The speed data for the third location was
obtained using radar data exclusively. When evaluating speed data, two common measures
are the 85th-percentile speed and the 10 mph pace. The 85th-percentile speed is defined as
the speed at or below which 85 percent of the free-flowing vehicles are traveling. The 10-mph
pace is the 10-mph range that contains the most vehicles.

The posted speed limit on County Road 44, approximately 3,000 feet east of State Road 19, is
45 miles per hour (mph). The 85th percentile speed for eastbound traffic was 54 mph with a
10-mph pace ranging between 45 and 55 mph (nearly 70% of all vehicular speeds were
between 45 and 55 mph). For westbound, the 85 th-percentile speed was between 56 and 57
mph with a 10-mph pace between 45 and 55 mph (approximately 67% of all traffic traveled
between 45 and 55 mph). The location at which the speed data was collected does have
shoulders and, based on the field assessment, it is comfortable to operate a vehicle upwards
of 55 mph on this section. Thus, based on field observations and data for County Road 44,
between State Road 19 and the Eustis Bypass, it can be justified to increase the posted speed
limit from 45 mph up to 50 mph or 55 mph. However, a detailed engineering assessment of
clear zone widths and sight distance would need to be conducted to determine if changes are
needed to accommodate the increased speed (review of horizontal and vertical geometry).
The posted speed limit on County Road 44A, west of East Lake Seneca Road is 55 mph. The
85th-percentile speed, based on the average of the tube and radar data, was approximately 60
mph for both the eastbound and westbound directions. The 10-mph pace was between 50 and
59 mph for both directions. This data suggests that the 55 mph posted speed limit is
appropriate.

For County Road 44 A, west of State Road 44, the posted speed limit is 55 mph. The 85th-
percentile speed was 58 mph for both the eastbound and westbound directions. The 10-mph
pace was between 50 and 59 mph for both directions. This data suggests that the 55 mph
posted speed limit is appropriate.
Copies of the speed data printouts are provided in the Appendix.
Collision Data
Based on a review of the crash data provided by Lake County for the 3-year period from
January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012, there were 35 crashes of which 14 occurred in 2010,
eight (8) crashes occurred in 2011, and 13 occurred in 2012. Below is a summary of the
crashes:
    The primary crash types included 10 rear-end, eight (8) fixed-object, six (6) angle, and
       five (5) side-swipe crashes.
    The crashes resulted in two (2) fatalities and 34 injuries.
    $186,750 in estimated property damage occurred.
    One fatal crash was a hit-and-run pedestrian-related crash. The other fatal crash was a
       one-vehicle crash where a motorcyclist struck a guardrail just east of County Road 439.
       The cause of this crash was undetermined.
    30 crashes occurred under dry conditions and five (5) under wet conditions
    28 of the crashes occurred during the day, five (5) at night, one (1) at dusk, and one (1)
       at dawn.
    One (1) crash involved a tractor-trailer. There were no injuries resulting from this crash.
A detailed collision summary is provided in Table 3 and crash locations shown in Figure 5.

It should be noted that a third fatal crash occurred on County Road 44A in January of 2013.
However, because the details of the crash are not currently available, this crash is not reflected
in the collision summary or in Figure 5.

When evaluating crash data, the typical threshold for identifying a crash trend is five crashes
within a year for a particular type of crash at a particular location. The summarized crashes
involve various movements, with no single type of crash for a movement at a particular location
exhibiting a five-per-year trend.

NOISE EVALUATION
A traffic noise study was performed to evaluate eliminating truck traffic on County Road 44A.
The analysis was prepared in accordance with Title 23 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Part 772, Procedures for Abatement of Highway Traffic Noise and Construction Noise. The
analysis also used methodologies established by the Florida Department of Transportation
(FDOT) that are documented in the Project Development and Environment (PD&E) Manual,
Part 2, Chapter 17 (May 24, 2011). The predicted traffic noise levels discussed in this
document are expressed in decibels (dB) on the A-weighted scale (dB(A)). This scale most
closely approximates the response characteristics of the human ear to traffic noise.
Additionally, all traffic noise levels are reported as equivalent levels (Leq(h)), which are
equivalent steady-state sound levels that contain the same acoustic energy as time-varying
sound levels over a period of one-hour.
Noise Reduction Criteria
Decibels are logarithmic units. Therefore, the sound levels of two sources cannot be added (or
subtracted) using ordinary arithmetic means. For example, if one automobile produces a
sound level of 90 dB(A), adding another automobile producing the same sound level does not
increase the sound level to 180 dB(A). Instead, the sound level only increases three dB(A).
Based on studies performed by the FHWA and others, this level of increase (or decrease) is
considered to be only barely perceptible.
For the purpose of evaluating the reduction in sound levels due to the restriction of trucks on
County Road 44A, the relative loudness guidelines presented in Table 4 were assumed.
These guidelines were obtained from the FHWA's Highway Traffic Noise Analysis and
Abatement Policy and Guidance (June 1995).
                                          Table 4
                              Perceived Changes in Sound Level

                             Sound Level
                            Change (dB(A))     Relative Loudness
                                  -3          Barely Perceptible
                                  -5          Readily Perceptible
                                 -10          Half as Loud

Because people perceive changes in sound levels differently, there is no exact measure of the
reduction in sound that is necessary for someone to perceive that a substantial noise increase
or noise reduction has occurred. For the purpose of the County Road 44A study, the measure
of a substantial noise increase from the FDOT's Noise Policy (Chapter 17 of the PD&E
Manual) was assumed. As defined by the FDOT, a substantial noise increase (in this case a
reduction) occurs when a project increases traffic noise levels 15 dB(A) or more.

Computer Prediction Model
The prediction of traffic noise levels with and without trucks (for this analysis, trucks represent
any vehicle in class 5 to class 15) was performed using the FHWA's computer model for
highway traffic noise prediction and analysis ­ the Traffic Noise Model (TNM, Version 2.5).
The TNM propagates sound energy, in one-third octave bands, between highways and nearby
receptors (i.e., listeners) accounting for the intervening ground's acoustical characteristics
(e.g., grass, concrete). The following were assumed in the development of the TNM input.
       Based on a spot speed study, all motor vehicles were assumed to be traveling 59 miles-
       per-hour.
       All receptor heights were assumed to be five feet above ground level.
       For the purpose of the analysis, receptors were located at ten-foot intervals beginning
       ten feet from the edge of the travel lane and extending 250 feet from the travel lane.
       The traffic data used in the analysis was based on 48-hour classification counts
       conducted on County Road 44A in April of 2013.
       The roadway was analyzed as a two-lane rural roadway without curb and gutter.
       The intervening ground between the roadway shoulder and the evaluated receptors was
       assumed to be grass.
Two scenarios were evaluated, representing the peak-hours of the day (AM peak and PM
peak) when the maximum total traffic combined with heavy truck volumes traversed County
Road 44A.
Results of the Analysis
The results of the analysis are presented in Table 5. As shown for both scenarios, should all
trucks (class 5 to class 15 vehicles) be completely removed from County Road 44A, then the
average reduction in traffic noise that would result only averages 1 dB(A), a change in the
traffic noise level that would not be considered perceptible. It should be noted that the noise
levels in Table 5 are based on an exterior receptor.
Individual Vehicle Impacts
While the analysis above focuses on noise levels over a certain time of day, it does not
quantify the isolated noise increase resulting from a single vehicle. Using information from
FHWA's Technical Manual for their Traffic Noise Model, the maximum interior A -weighted
sound levels (dB(A)) within a light frame structure for a vehicle passing by a residence located
90 feet from the roadway is approximately 43.6 dB(A) for a passenger vehicle and 54.6 dB(A)
for a heavy truck, a difference of approximately 11.0 dB(A) at the moment when then vehicle is
closest to the receptor.

QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT
The 12.5-mile section of County Road 44/County Road 44A between State Road 19 and State
Road 44 was observed during mid-day and PM peak-period conditions by a registered
professional engineer to assess existing operating conditions. The following conditions were
observed:
          Sight distance appeared to be adequate along the corridor.
          On County Road 44 between State Road 19 and the Eustis Bypass motorists
          appeared to travel 5 to 10 mph above the speed limit. On County Road 44A
          between the Eustis Bypass and State Road 44, motorists appeared to travel at or
          slightly over the speed limit, including tractor-trailers.
          No conflicts or issues were observed with regard to motorists turning onto or off of
          the side streets.
          Four (4) school buses were observed along the corridor.             At the bus stops, all
          motorists stopped appropriately.
          The majority of trucks traveling on County Road 44 between State Road 19 and the
          Eustis Bypass traveled via the Eustis Bypass
          Two developments located on County Road 437 south of County Road 44A
          generate tractor-trailer truck traffic. A few vehicles from these developments were
          observed traveling on County Road 44A.
          Two (2) tractor-trailer trucks were observed turning off of minor side streets.
          No issues or conflicts were observed with regard to tractor-trailer trucks.

CONCLUSIONS
The following are conclusions based on the traffic data reviewed for this study and the field
observations conducted with regard to County Road 44/County Road 44A between State Road
19 and State Road 44:
      The historical annual growth rates in traffic volumes indicate that traffic has decreased
      over the past ten (10) years. Over the past five (5) years, traffic volumes have generally
      decreased with the exception of marginal growth (average of 0.3% per year) on the
      section between State Road 19 and the Eustis Bypass (County Road 44).
      Single-unit trucks account for approximately 2.4% to 4.3% of the total traffic on County
      Road 44/County Road 44A between State Road 19 and State Road 44. Tractor-trailer
      trucks account for approximately 3.5% to 5.6% of the total traffic on County Road
      44/County Road 44A between State Road 19 and State Road 44.
      Traffic data showed that more than 60% of the truck traffic approaching the County
      Road 44/County Road 44A/Eustis Bypass intersection uses the Eustis Bypass.
      Based on observations, a portion of the tractor-trailer trucks on County Road
      44A/County Road 44 are to/from developments located on County Road 437 south of
      County Road 44A as well as other side streets.
      Historical truck data indicates that there has been no growth in single-unit or tractor-
      trailer truck traffic between 2009 and 2012. Considering that the historical annual
      growth rate for total traffic volumes for the past five (5) years on County Road 44A has
      not shown an increase in traffic volumes, it is reasonable to conclude that truck traffic
      has likely not increased over the past five (5) years on County Road 44A.
      Based on field observations and data for County Road 44, between State Road 19 and
      the Eustis Bypass, it can be justified to increase the posted speed limit from 45 mph up
      to 50 mph or 55 mph. However, a detailed engineering assessment of clear zone
      widths and sight distance would need to be conducted to determine if changes are
      needed to accommodate the increased speed (review of horizontal and vertical
      geometry).
      The posted speed limit of 55 mph on County Road 44A, west of East Lake Seneca
      Road and west of State Road 44 is appropriate based on the speed data and field
      review.
      Based on the noise evaluation, should all trucks (class 5 to class 15 vehicles) be
      completely removed from County Road 44A, then the average reduction in traffic noise
      that would result only averages 1 dB(A), a change in the traffic noise level that would
      not be considered perceptible.

      Between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2012, there were 35 crashes. The primary
      crash types included 10 rear-end, eight (8) fixed-object, six (6) angle, and five (5) side-
      swipe crashes. The crashes resulted in two (2) fatalities, 34 injuries, and $186,750 in
      estimated property damage occurred.
      There was one (1) crash that involved a tractor-trailer. No injuries resulted from the
      crash.
      Regarding the fatal crashes, one was a hit-and-run pedestrian-related crash and the
      other a one-vehicle crash where the vehicle struck a guardrail just east of County Road
      439.
      Based on field observations, sight distance appeared to be adequate along the corridor.
      Motorists appeared to travel at or slightly over the speed limit, including tractor-trailers.
      No conflicts or issues were observed with regard to motorists turning onto or off of the
      side streets or regarding tractor-trailer trucks.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on traffic data and field observations, there were no specific issues or concerns
identified relating tractor-trailer truck traffic on County Road 44A. Thus, there are no
recommendations relating specifically to tractor-trailer traffic. Additionally, the summarized
crashes involve various movements, with no single type of crash for a movement at a
particular location exhibiting a five-per-year trend. However, should the County implement
improvements/modifications on the study corridor such as resurfacing, the County may want to
consider constructing paved shoulders as part of any future improvements on County Road
44A. Per the American Association for State Highway and Transportation Officials' (AASHTO)
Highway Safety Manual, 1st Edition (HSM), the installation of 4-foot paved shoulders has been
estimated to reduce single-vehicle-run-off-the-road crashes, head-on crashes, and sideswipe
crashes on two-lane rural roadways by more than 20%. Additionally, the County may also
want to consider the installation of audible pavement markings as they are estimated in the
Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) "Desktop Reference for Crash Reduction Factors"
(Report No. FHWA-SA-07-015, September 2007) to reduce single-vehicle-run-off-the-road
crashes by up to 25%. It should be noted that these two recommendations are provided in that
they would be expected to provide a reduction in crashes. But, given that a crash trend
pertaining to single-vehicle-run-off-the-road crashes, head-on crashes, and sideswipe crashes
was not identified along the corridor, the benefit of installing either of these improvements is
not expected to be significant and thus may not be justifiable given the potential engineering
and construction costs.

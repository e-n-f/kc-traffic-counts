Executive Summary


This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed Martial Cottle
Park located on the northwest corner of Snell Avenue and Chynoweth Avenue in San Jose, California.
The report documents the impacts to the surrounding transportation system that are associated with
developing the proposed project.

The Santa Clara County Parks and Recreation Department are planning the park in cooperation with
the California State Parks Planning Division. The proposed development is envisioned as a historic
agricultural park that could include such uses as a historic farm, visitor center, picnic areas,
production agriculture, a farmer's market, a produce stand (existing), and multi-use trails. Currently,
the 288-acre site is mostly undeveloped. Access to the site would be provided via a main entrance on
Snell Avenue with service and emergency access roads along Chynoweth Avenue and Branham Lane.


Scope of Study
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the
proposed project. The potential impacts of the project were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the City of San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA). The VTA administers the County Congestion Management Program (CMP).

The study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak-hour traffic conditions for 38 signalized intersections
and 10 directional freeway segments. The study intersections were selected based upon the estimated
number of project trips through the intersection (10 or more trips per lane per hour).

Traffic conditions at all of the study intersections and study freeway segments were analyzed for the
weekday AM and PM peak hours. The weekday AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and
9:00 AM and the weekday PM peak hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these
periods that the most congested traffic conditions occur on a typical weekday. Additionally, Saturday
peak-hour traffic conditions were analyzed for eight selected major intersections in the immediate vicinity

of the project site. The study also includes an operations analysis, based on vehicle-storage requirements
at select intersections.

Project Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate to common land uses their propensity
for producing traffic. Thus, for the most common land uses, there are standard trip generation rates that
can be applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new development.
However, the proposed park will consist of land uses that are atypical of common parks. Therefore,
documented trip generation data provided for common parks were investigated and found to be
inapplicable to the proposed project and not used to estimate trips for the proposed project.

Thus, the trip estimates for the proposed project were developed based upon land use assumptions and
visitor data provided by County Parks' staff. The visitor data was then converted into vehicular trips
based on assumptions for mode split, time of arrival/departure, and vehicle occupancy rates. The
vehicular conversion assumptions were based on engineering judgment by Hexagon staff.

Driveway and vehicle occupancy counts were conducted at a comparable existing park for the purpose of
providing support for the use of the estimated trip generation based upon the proposed park usage. The
counts were conducted at Ardenwood Park in Fremont, California in April 2009. The data collected
indicated much lower trip generation characteristics than those estimated based upon the proposed park
usage. Therefore, as a conservative approach, the analysis presented within this report utilizes trip
estimates for the proposed project developed using land use assumptions and visitor data provided by
County Parks' staff.

Based on land use and visitor assumptions, it is estimated that the proposed project would generate 278
AM peak-hour trips (247 inbound trips and 31 outbound trips) and 266 PM peak-hour trips (114 inbound
trips and 152 outbound trips).


Project Impacts
Intersection Level of Service Impacts

The intersection level of service is summarized in Table ES 1. The results of the intersection level of
service analysis under project conditions show that no study intersections would be impacted by the
project according to City of San Jose and the Congestion Management Program (CMP) of the Santa Clara
Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) level of service standards.

Freeway Segment Impacts

The freeway segment level of service analysis is summarized in Table ES 2. The results of the freeway
segment level of service analysis show that the project traffic would constitute less than one percent of
freeway capacity and would not cause an impact on any of the study segments according to the CMP
criteria for significant impacts on freeways.

Other Transportation Issues

Site Access
A main entrance along Snell Avenue will serve the project site with service and emergency access roads
along Chynoweth Avenue and Branham Lane. Operations analysis was completed to evaluate the effects
on roadway operations due to the park entrance. The operations analysis consists of signal warrant
checks, vehicle queue analysis, and signalized intersection level of service at the Branham Lane and
Chynoweth Avenue intersections along Snell Avenue since they would be most effected by the design of
the Snell Avenue park entrance.


Full Buildout Conditions

Ultimately, under buildout conditions of the park, a main project entrance would be located at the
entrance to the Life Estate just south of Obert Drive. But, an interim park entrance will need to be
located elsewhere until control of the Life Estate is obtained. The exact location of a potential interim
entrance along Snell Avenue has yet to be determined, but options are somewhat limited by the
spacing of existing intersections along Snell Avenue. It would be preferable to align the project
entrance with an opposing street, Rue Paris or Kehoe Court, on the east side of Snell Avenue.
Aligning the entrance with an opposing street would limit turn-movement conflicts and be less
obstructive to traffic flow along Snell Avenue. Rue Paris is located approximately 550 feet south of
Branham Lane. The City of San Jose requires a minimum spacing of 500 feet between signalized
intersections. Thus, the location of a project entrance opposing Rue Paris may be feasible.

Regardless of the location of the entrance, peak hour volume signal warrants indicate the need for
signalization of the Snell Avenue entrance. Along with the signalization of the entrance, project
traffic volumes indicate the need for the addition of a left-turn lane with a minimum of 250 feet of
storage capacity provided and protected phasing along Snell Avenue. A right-turn lane on Snell
Avenue into the project entrance should also be provided. Snell Avenue may require widening at the
entrance location to provide the left and right turn lanes. The widening would be dependent on
parking and bike lane removal at the selected location. A separate left-turn lane and a shared through-
right-turn lane would be needed to serve outbound project traffic.

Vehicle queue estimates indicate a 250-foot projected left-turn queue from Snell Avenue into the
project entrance. Thus, locating the driveway across from Kehoe Court may inhibit movements from
Obert Drive, which is located just 220 feet south of Kehoe Court. Therefore, should it be deemed that
a project entrance location opposite Rue Paris is not feasible by City staff, an alternative would
require the entrance to be located between Rue Paris and Kehoe Court. The entrance would need to be
located a minimum of 250 feet north of Kehoe Court to accommodate the northbound left-turn queue
into the project entrance.

Intersection Operations Analysis

The operations analysis indicated that the estimated 95th percentile vehicle queues for turn-movements at
Branham Lane and Chynoweth Avenue intersections with Snell Avenue would exceed the existing
vehicle storage capacity under project conditions.

Snell Avenue and Branham Lane

The 95th percentile queue of 575 feet for the northbound left-turn lane on Snell Avenue to westbound
Branham Lane under buildout project conditions would exceed the existing storage capacity of 325 feet
per lane. In addition, the 95th percentile queue of 250 feet for the westbound left-turn lane on Branham
Lane to southbound Snell Avenue under buildout project conditions would exceed the existing storage
capacity of 225 feet per lane.

Recommendation: The recommended improvement for the intersection of Snell Avenue and Branham
Lane is to provide a second northbound left-turn lane and extend the existing westbound left-turn pocket
by approximately 25 ft. to provide a total of 250 ft. of queue storage capacity.

Snell Avenue and Chynoweth Avenue

The 95th percentile queue of 300 feet for the southbound left-turn lane on Snell Avenue to eastbound
Chynoweth Avenue under buildout project conditions would exceed the existing storage capacity of 225
feet per lane.

Recommendation: The recommended improvement for the intersection of Snell Avenue and Chynoweth
Avenue is to extend the existing southbound left-turn pocket by approximately 75 ft. to provide a total of
300 ft. of queue storage capacity.


Interim Project Conditions

The close spacing of existing unsignalized intersections that could potentially serve as interim park
entrance locations will inhibit location of a new signalized entrance. The City of San Jose requires a
minimum spacing of 500 feet between signalized intersections. Therefore, the maximum park size
that could be accommodated without meeting signal warrants at a new park entrance was evaluated.
The signal warrant analysis indicates that the park size and associated trips generated by the park
would need to be reduced a minimum of 65%. With the reduction and unsignalized control, access to
the park from a new entrance along Snell Avenue would be restricted to right-turns in and out only. A
median along Snell Avenue or a physical barrier at the park entrance would also need to be
constructed to restrict left-turn access from Snell Avenue.

The restriction of park access at a new unsignalized entrance along Snell Avenue would require that
U-turn movements be made at the Branham Lane and Chynoweth Avenue intersections along Snell
Avenue. Vehicles bound for the park from northbound Snell Avenue, south of the park entrance,
would need to proceed pass the park entrance and make a U-turn at Branham Lane and head back
south on Snell Avenue and into the park entrance. Vehicles exiting the park and bound for
northbound Snell Avenue would need to make a right-turn out of the project driveway and proceed
south to Chynoweth Avenue to make a U-turn.

The restriction of access at an unsignalized park entrance may result in operational issues at the
Branham Lane and Chynoweth Avenue intersections with Snell Avenue. Therefore, operational
analysis was performed at the Branham Lane and Chynoweth Avenue intersections with Snell
Avenue to evaluate the effects of the increased demand at the intersections due to the U-turn
movements described above. The installation of a signal at the park entrance along Snell Avenue
would not alleviate operational issues at the Branham Avenue and Chynoweth intersections, but
vehicle queues would not be as severe since U-turn movements would not be required.

Snell Avenue and Branham Lane

Vehicle queue estimates indicate queues of up to 525 feet for the northbound left-turn lane under
existing conditions. The storage capacity for the northbound left-turn lane at the Branham/Snell
intersection is only 325 feet. Thus, the addition of any project traffic to the northbound left-turn
movement, as would be done by the previously described U-turn movements, will worsen existing
operational problems at the Branham Lane/Snell Avenue intersection. The addition of a second
northbound left-turn lane at the intersection will alleviate operational deficiencies, but will require
widening of Snell Avenue and signal modifications at the intersection.

Snell Avenue and Chynoweth Avenue

The Chynoweth Avenue intersection with Snell Avenue currently experiences operational issues
similar to those described at the Branham Lane intersection with Snell Avenue. Vehicle queue
estimates indicate queues of 275 feet for the southbound left-turn lane under existing conditions. The
storage capacity for the southbound left-turn lane at the Chynoweth/Snell intersection is only 225
feet. Thus, the addition of any project traffic to the southbound left-turn movement, as would be done
by the previously described U-turn movements, will worsen existing operational problems at the
Chynoweth Avenue/Snell Avenue intersection. The addition of a second southbound left-turn lane at
the intersection will alleviate operational deficiencies, and can be completed by re-striping and signal
modifications at the intersection.


Transit, Pedestrian and Bicycle Analysis

Although no deduction was applied to the estimated trip generation for the project, it can be assumed that
some of the project trips could be made by transit. Assuming up to 3% transit mode share, which is
probably the highest that could be expected, yields an estimate of approximately 9 transit trips during
both the AM and PM peak hours and 23 transit trips during the Saturday peak hour. These riders easily
could be accommodated by the existing service. The site is currently served by three bus routes and LRT
service. The nearest bus stops to the project are located near the intersection of Snell Avenue/Branham
Lane and Snell Avenue/Chynoweth Avenue. The Branham LRT station also is located near the SR
87/Branham Lane.

The bikeways within the vicinity of the project site include bike lanes on Snell Avenue, Branham Lane,
Narvaez Avenue, Lean Avenue, and Monterey Road.

VTA recommends new developments to provide bicycle parking, and provides recommended bicycle
parking rates in their VTA Countywide Bicycle Plan Technical Guidelines, September 1999. According to
VTA's recommended rates, parks/ recreational fields (such as the proposed project) should provide one
Class I bicycle parking space for every 30 employees and one Class II bicycle parking space for every 9
users during peak daylight times of peak season. The project should provide adequate parking according
to the recommended rates.

Introduction

This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed Martial Cottle
Park located on the northwest corner of Snell Avenue and Chynoweth Avenue in San Jose, California.
The report documents the impacts to the surrounding transportation system that are associated with
developing the proposed project.

The Santa Clara County Parks and Recreation Department are planning the park in cooperation with
the California State Parks Planning Division. The proposed development is envisioned as a historic
agricultural park that could include such uses as a historic farm, visitor center, picnic areas,
production agriculture, a farmer's market, a produce stand (existing), and multi-use trails. Currently,
the 288-acre site is mostly undeveloped. Access to the site would be provided via a main entrance on
Snell Avenue with service and emergency access roads along Chynoweth Avenue and Branham Lane.
The project site and the surrounding study area are shown on Figure 1. The project site plan is shown on
Figure 2.


Scope of Study
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the
proposed project. The potential impacts of the project were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the City of San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA). The VTA administers the County Congestion Management Program (CMP).

The study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak-hour traffic conditions for 38 signalized intersections
and 10 directional freeway segments. The study intersections were selected based upon the estimated
number of project trips through the intersection (10 or more trips per lane per hour). The study
intersections and freeway segments are identified below and shown in Figure 1.

In summary, the study includes an analysis of 38 signalized intersections and 10 directional freeway
segments in the vicinity of the project site. Fourteen of the 38 study intersections are designated CMP
intersections. The 14 CMP signalized intersections were evaluated against the standards of both the City
of San Jose and the Santa Clara County CMP.

Traffic conditions at all of the study intersections and study freeway segments were analyzed for the
weekday AM and PM peak hours. The weekday AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and
9:00 AM and the weekday PM peak hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these
periods that the most congested traffic conditions occur on a typical weekday. Additionally, Saturday
peak-hour traffic conditions were analyzed for eight selected major intersections in the immediate vicinity
of the project site. The Saturday midday peak hour, projected to ocuur between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM,
is the period of peak traffic generation for the project itself.

Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:

    Scenario 1:   Existing Conditions. Existing conditions were represented by existing peak-hour traffic
                  volumes on the existing roadway network. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from
                  the City of San Jose and recent traffic counts.

    Scenario 2:   Background Conditions. Background traffic volumes were estimated by adding to
                  existing peak-hour volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet completed
                  developments. The latter component is contained in the City of San Jose Approved
                  Trips Inventory (ATI).

    Scenario 3:   Project Conditions. Background traffic volumes with the project (hereafter called
                  project traffic volumes) were estimated by adding to background traffic volumes the
                  additional traffic generated by the project. Project conditions were evaluated relative to
                  background conditions in order to determine potential project impacts.


Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described
above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable
level of service standards.

Data Requirements

The data required for the analysis were obtained from new traffic counts, previous traffic studies, and the
City of San Jose. The following data were collected from these sources:

   existing traffic volumes
   lane configurations
   signal timing and phasing (for signalized intersections only)
   average speeds on freeways
   approved development traffic volumes

Signalized Intersection Analysis Methodologies and Level of Service Standards

Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service
is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little
or no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The correlation between average
delay and level of service is shown in Table 1.

Signalized Study Intersections

All of the study intersections are located within the City of San Jose and are therefore subject to the City's
Level of Service standards. The City of San Jose level of service methodology for signalized intersections
is the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method, which is applied using the TRAFFIX software.
The 2000 HCM operations method, via TRAFFIX, evaluates signalized intersection operations on the
basis of average control delay time for all vehicles at the intersection. Control delay is the amount of
delay that is attributed to the particular traffic control device at the intersection, and includes initial
deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. Since TRAFFIX is
also the CMP-designated intersection level of service methodology, the City of San Jose methodology

       B        Operations with low delay occurring with good progression and/or               10.1 to 20.0
                short cycle lengths.

       C        Operations with average delays resulting from fair progression                 20.1 to 35.0
                and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures begin to
                appear.

       D        Operations with longer delays due to a combination of unfavorable              35.1 to 55.0
                progression, long cycle lengths, or high V/C ratios. Many vehicles
                stop and individual cycle failures are noticeable.

       E        Operations with high delay values indicating poor progression, long            55.1 to 80.0
                cycle lengths, and high V/C ratios. Individual cycle failures are
                 frequent occurrences. This is considered to be the limit of
                acceptable delay.

       F        Operation with delays unacceptable to most drivers occurring due             Greater than 80.0
                to oversaturation, poor progression, or very long cycle lengths.

standard for signalized intersections is LOS D or better.

CMP Intersections

Since TRAFFIX is the designated level of service methodology for the CMP and the City of San Jose, the
CMP study intersections are not analyzed separately, but rather are among the local signalized study
intersections analyzed using TRAFFIX. The only difference between the City of San Jose and CMP
analyses is that project impacts are determined on the basis of different level of service standards  the
CMP level of service standard for signalized intersections is LOS E or better.

Freeway Segments

As prescribed in the CMP technical guidelines, the level of service for freeway segments is estimated
based on vehicle density. Density is calculated by the following formula:

                 D = V / (N*S)
        where:
                 D= density, in vehicles per mile per lane (vpmpl)
                 V= peak hour volume, in vehicles per hour (vph)
                 N= number of travel lanes
                 S= average travel speed, in miles per hour (mph)

The vehicle density on a segment is correlated to level of service as shown in Table 2. The CMP requires
that mixed-flow lanes and auxiliary lanes be analyzed separately from HOV (carpool) lanes. The CMP
specifies that a capacity of 2,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) be used for segments six lanes or
wider in both directions and a capacity of 2,200 vphpl be used for segments four lanes wide in both
directions. The CMP defines an acceptable level of service for freeway segments as LOS E or better.

             A                                         < 11.0
             B                                       11.0 - 18.0
             C                                       18.0 - 26.0
             D                                       26.0 - 46.0
             E                                       46.0 - 58.0
             F                                         > 58.0



Signal Warrants

The level of service analysis at unsignalized intersections is supplemented with an assessment of the need
for signalization of the intersection. This assessment is made on the basis of the Peak-Hour Volume
Signal Warrant, (Warrant #3  Part B) described in the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD), adopted in September 2006. This method makes no evaluation of intersection level of

service, but simply provides an indication whether peak-hour traffic volumes are, or would be, sufficient
to justify installation of a traffic signal.

The decision to install a traffic signal should not be based purely on the warrants alone. Instead, the
installation of a signal should be considered and further analysis performed when one or more of the
warrants are met. Additionally, engineering judgment should be exercised on a case-by-case basis to
evaluate the effect a traffic signal will have on certain types of accidents and traffic conditions at the
subject intersection as well as at adjacent intersections.

Intersection Operations

The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand movements at intersections.
Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the probability of
"n" vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:

         P (x=n) =       n e  ()
                           n!

Where:

         P (x=n) = probability of "n" vehicles in queue per lane
         n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
          = Average number of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hour per lane/signal cycles
             per hour)

The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the 95th
percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet
per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned available
storage capacity for the movement.

                 5 Blossom Hill Road and SR 85 (W) * (LOS E  AM Peak Hour)
                22 Capitol Expressway and Snell Avenue (LOS E  AM Peak Hour)

Both intersections are CMP designated intersections. All other signalized study intersections currently
operate at an acceptable LOS D or better, according to City of San Jose standards. The level of service
calculation sheets are included in Appendix C.

CMP Intersection Analysis

The intersection level of service results for the CMP intersections under existing conditions are
summarized in Table 3. The results show that, measured against the CMP level of service standards, all of
the CMP study intersections currently operate at an acceptable LOS E or better during the peak hours.


Existing Freeway Levels of Service
Traffic volumes for the study freeway segments for the weekday AM and PM peak hours were obtained
from the 2008 CMP Annual Monitoring Report. Freeway segment volume data for time periods other
than the standard AM and PM peak hour are not available from the CMP. Therefore, freeway segment
traffic volumes for the Saturday peak hour were derived utilizing weekday and Saturday volumes on
freeway ramps in the vicinity of the project site. The comparison of Saturday peak hour (11:00 AM-1:00
PM) ramp volumes and weekday (4:00-6:00 PM) ramp volume data indicated that Saturday peak hour
voumes are approximately 70% of that of the weekday PM peak hour. Thus, the standard PM peak hour
CMP freeway segment volumes were reduced by 70% to derive the freeway segment volumes for the
Saturday peak hour study period.

The results show that the mixed-flow lanes on 3 of the 10 directional freeway segments analyzed
currently operate at an unaccpetable LOS F during at least one of the peak hours. All other freeway
segments analyzed oeprate at LOS E or better during the AM, PM, and Saturday peak hours. The existing
freeway level of service is summarized in Table 4.


Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and to
confirm the accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify any
existing traffic problems that may not be directly related to intersection level of service, and (2) to
identify any locations where the level of service calculation does not accurately reflect level of service in
the field.

Field observations revealed the following operational problems that may not be reflected in level of
service calculations:

SR 87 and Narvaez Avenue  During the AM peak hour, the queue of vehicles accessing the SR 87
northbound on-ramp from northbound and southbound Narvaez Avenue are considerably long. The
northbound queue on Narvaez Avenue extends beyond the intersection of Narvaez Avenue/Capitol
Expressway along both the eastbound left-turn approach and the westbound right-turn approach. It was
observed that because of the long queues along Narvaez Avenue, eastbound left-turning traffic on Capitol
Expressway to northbound Narvaez Avenue would constantly block the intersection hindering the flow of
westbound traffic along Capitol Expressway. Plenty of queue storage space for the southbound queue on

Background Conditions

This chapter describes background traffic conditions. Background conditions are defined as conditions
just prior to completion of the proposed development. Traffic volumes for background conditions
comprise volumes from existing traffic counts plus traffic generated by other approved developments in
the vicinity of the site. This chapter describes the procedure used to determine background traffic volumes
and the resulting traffic conditions.


Background Transportation Network
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background conditions would be the
same as the existing transportation network.


Background Traffic Volumes
Background peak-hour traffic volumes were calculated by adding to existing volumes the estimated
traffic from approved but not yet constructed developments. The added traffic from approved but not yet
constructed developments were provided by the city in the form of the Approved Trips Inventory (ATI).
There is no database available for the Saturday peak hour. It is assumed that approved project traffic will
be negligible during the Saturday peak hour. Background traffic volumes are shown on Figure 7.

City of San Jose Intersection Analysis

The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background conditions are summarized in
Table 5. The results show that, measured against the City of San Jose level of service standards, four of
the study intersections would operate at an unacceptable LOS E during at least one of the peak hours
under background conditions. The intersections projected to operate at unacceptable levels are the
following:

                 5   Blossom Hill Road and SR 85 (W) * (LOS E  AM Peak Hour)
                14   Blossom Hill Road and Monterey Road (N) * (LOS E  AM Peak Hour)
                22   Capitol Expressway and Snell Avenue (LOS E  AM Peak Hour)
                27   Capitol Expressway and SR 87 * (LOS E  PM Peak Hour)

The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix C.

CMP Intersection Analysis

The intersection level of service results for the CMP intersections under background conditions are
summarized in Table 5. The results show that, measured against the CMP level of service standards, all of
the CMP study intersections currently operate at an acceptable LOS E or better during the peak hours.

Project Impacts and Mitigation Measures

This chapter describes project traffic conditions, significant project impacts, and measures that are
recommended to mitigate project impacts. Included are descriptions of the significance criteria that define
an impact, estimates of project-generated traffic, identification of the impacts, and descriptions of the
mitigation measures. Project conditions are represented by background traffic conditions with the addition
of traffic generated by the project.


Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis, there are various
sets of relevant criteria for impacts on intersections and freeway segments. These are based on (1) the
City of San Jose (CSJ) Level of Service standards, (2) the CMP Level of Service standards, (3) the CMP
Freeway Segment Level of Service standards, and (4) the City of San Jose traffic operations requirements.

Project impacts on other transportation facilities, such as bicycle facilities and transit, were determined on
the basis of engineering judgment.

City of San Jose Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts

All intersections within the City of San Jose, including CMP designated intersections, are required to
meet the City's LOS standard of LOS D.

The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at signalized intersections if
for either peak hour:

    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under
       background conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under project conditions, or

    2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under background
       conditions and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement delay at the
       intersection to increase by four or more seconds and the demand-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to
       increase by .01 or more.

An exception to this rule applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average
control delay for critical movements (i.e. the change in average control delay for critical movements is
negative). In this case, the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by .01 or more.

A significant impact by City of San Jose standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore intersection level of service to background conditions or better.

CMP Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts

The definition of a significant impact at a CMP intersection is the same as for the City of San Jose, except
that the CMP standard for acceptable level of service at a CMP intersection is LOS E or better. A
significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore intersection conditions to LOS E or better.

CMP Definition of Significant Freeway Segment Impacts

A project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions on a CMP freeway segment if
for either peak hour:

    1. The level of service on the freeway segment is an unacceptable LOS F under project conditions,
       and
    2. The number of project trips on that segment constitutes at least one percent of capacity on that
       segment.
    3. The level of service on the freeway segment degrades from an acceptable LOS under existing
       conditions to an unacceptable LOS F under project conditions.

A significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore freeway conditions to background conditions or better.

Traffic Operational Requirements

Traffic operational requirements are determined based on the adequacy of existing storage to
accommodate estimated maximum vehicle queues at turn pockets. The project is said to create a
significant adverse impact on traffic conditions if for either peak-hour:

        The estimated maximum (95th-percentile) vehicle queue exceeds the available storage capacity of
        an intersection turn pocket.

A significant traffic operational impact is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would provide the storage capacity needed to accommodate the estimated maximum
vehicle queues.

Transportation Network Under Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under project conditions scenarios would be
the same as described under background conditions.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear are estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site is
estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate is made of
the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment, the project
trips are assigned to specific streets and intersections. These procedures are described further in the
following sections.

Trip Generation

Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate to common land uses their propensity
for producing traffic. Thus, for the most common land uses, there are standard trip generation rates that
can be applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new development.
However, the proposed park will consist of land uses that are atypical of common parks. Therefore,
documented trip generation data provided for common parks were investigated and found to be
inapplicable to the proposed project and not used to estimate trips for the proposed project.

Thus, the trip estimates for the proposed project were developed based upon land use assumptions and
visitor data provided by County Parks' staff. The visitor data was then converted into vehicular trips
based on assumptions for mode split, time of arrival/departure, and vehicle occupancy rates. The
vehicular conversion assumptions were based on engineering judgment by Hexagon staff.

Driveway and vehicle occupancy counts were conducted at a comparable existing park for the purpose of
providing support for the use of the estimated trip generation based upon the proposed park usage. The
counts were conducted at Ardenwood Park in Fremont, California in April 2009. The data collected
indicated much lower trip generation characteristics than those estimated based upon the proposed park
usage. Therefore, as a conservative approach, the analysis presented within this report utilizes trip
estimates for the proposed project developed using land use assumptions and visitor data provided by
County Parks' staff. The project trip generation estimates are presented in Table 6.

Based on land use and visitor assumptions, it is estimated that the proposed project would generate 278
AM peak-hour trips (247 inbound trips and 31 outbound trips) and 266 PM peak-hour trips (114 inbound
trips and 152 outbound trips).

Trip Distribution

The trip distribution pattern for the proposed project was estimated based on existing travel patterns in the
area and the locations of complementary land uses. The trip distribution patterns are shown graphically on
Figure 8.

Trip Assignment

The peak-hour trips generated by the proposed development were assigned to the roadway system in
accordance with the trip distribution pattern discussed above. Figure 9 show the project trip assignment at
the study intersections.


Project Traffic Volumes
Project trips, as represented in the above project trip assignment, were added to background traffic
volumes to obtain background plus project traffic volumes. Background traffic volumes plus project trips
are typically referred to simply as project traffic volumes; this is contrasted with the term project trips,
which is used to signify the traffic that is produced specifically by the project. The project traffic volumes
are shown graphically on Figure 10. Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in
Appendix B.


Project Intersection Analysis

City of San Jose Intersection Analysis

The results of the level of service analysis under project conditions are summarized in Table 7. The
results show that the same four intersections projected to operate at LOS E under background conditions
will continue to operate at unacceptable levels. However, when measured against the City of San Jose
level of service standards, no study intersection would be impacted by the project. The following
intersections are projected to operate at unacceptable levels:

                  5   Blossom Hill Road and SR 85 (W) * (LOS E  AM Peak Hour)
                 14   Blossom Hill Road and Monterey Road (N) * (LOS E  AM Peak Hour)
                 22   Capitol Expressway and Snell Avenue (LOS E  AM Peak Hour)
                 27   Capitol Expressway and SR 87 * (LOS E  PM Peak Hour)

 All other study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels. The level of service calculation
sheets are included in Appendix C.

CMP Intersection Analysis

The intersection level of service results for the CMP intersections under project conditions are
summarized in Table 7. The results show that, measured against the CMP level of service standards, all of
the CMP study intersections are projected to operate at an acceptable LOS E or better under project
conditions.

Freeway Segment Analysis
Project traffic volumes on the freeway segments were estimated by adding to existing freeway volumes
the estimated project trips on freeway segments. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 8.
The results show that the mixed-flow lanes on three of the ten directional freeway segments analyzed
would operate at an unacceptable LOS F during at least one of the peak hours under project conditions.
All other freeway segments analyzed would operate at LOS E or better during the AM, PM, and Saturday
peak hours.

Project traffic would constitute less than one percent of freeway capacity on each of the segments.
Therefore, based on the CMP criteria, the project would not have a significant impact on any of the study
freeway segments under project conditions.

Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents an analysis of other transportation issues associated with the project site, including:

        Site access
        Vehicle queuing and left-turn storage capacity
        Potential impacts to bike, pedestrian and transit facilities

Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is adopted by the City Council, the analyses in this
chapter are based on professional judgment in accordance with the standards and methods employed by
the traffic engineering community.


Site Access
A main entrance along Snell Avenue will serve the project site with service and emergency access roads
along Chynoweth Avenue and Branham Lane. Operations analysis was completed to evaluate the effects
on roadway operations due to the park entrance. The operations analysis consists of signal warrant
checks, vehicle queue analysis, and signalized intersection level of service at the Branham Lane and
Chynoweth Avenue intersections along Snell Avenue since they would be most effected by the design of
the Snell Avenue park entrance. Results of the evaluation of site driveway operations are summarized in
Table 9.


Full Buildout Conditions

Ultimately, under buildout conditions of the park, a main project entrance would be located at the
entrance to the Life Estate just south of Obert Drive. But, an interim park entrance will need to be
located elsewhere until control of the Life Estate is obtained. The exact location of a potential interim
entrance along Snell Avenue has yet to be determined, but options are somewhat limited by the
spacing of existing intersections along Snell Avenue. It would be preferable to align the project
entrance with an opposing street, Rue Paris or Kehoe Court, on the east side of Snell Avenue.

Aligning the entrance with an opposing street would limit turn-movement conflicts and be less
obstructive to traffic flow along Snell Avenue. Rue Paris is located approximately 550 feet south of
Branham Lane. The City of San Jose requires a minimum spacing of 500 feet between signalized
intersections. Thus, the location of a project entrance opposing Rue Paris may be feasible.

Regardless of the location of the entrance, peak hour volume signal warrants indicate the need for
signalization of the Snell Avenue entrance. Along with the signalization of the entrance, project
traffic volumes indicate the need for the addition of a left-turn lane with a minimum of 250 feet of
storage capacity provided and protected phasing along Snell Avenue. A right-turn lane on Snell
Avenue into the project entrance should also be provided. Snell Avenue may require widening at the
entrance location to provide the left and right turn lanes. The widening would be dependent on
parking and bike lane removal at the selected location. A separate left-turn lane and a shared through-
right-turn lane would be needed to serve outbound project traffic.

Vehicle queue estimates indicate a 250-foot projected left-turn queue from Snell Avenue into the
project entrance. Thus, locating the driveway across from Kehoe Court may inhibit movements from
Obert Drive, which is located just 220 feet south of Kehoe Court. Therefore, should it be deemed that
a project entrance location opposite Rue Paris is not feasible by City staff, an alternative would
require the entrance to be located between Rue Paris and Kehoe Court. The entrance would need to be
located a minimum of 250 feet north of Kehoe Court to accommodate the northbound left-turn queue
into the project entrance.

Intersection Operations Analysis

The operations analysis indicated that the estimated 95th percentile vehicle queues for turn-movements at
Branham Lane and Chynoweth Avenue intersections with Snell Avenue would exceed the existing
vehicle storage capacity under project conditions. Table 10 presents projected vehicle queues for all turn-
movements analyzed. The following movements would have inadequate queue storage capacity under
buildout project conditions.

Snell Avenue and Branham Lane

The 95th percentile queue of 575 feet for the northbound left-turn lane on Snell Avenue to westbound
Branham Lane under buildout project conditions would exceed the existing storage capacity of 325 feet
per lane. In addition, the 95th percentile queue of 250 feet for the westbound left-turn lane on Branham
Lane to southbound Snell Avenue under buildout project conditions would exceed the existing storage
capacity of 225 feet per lane.

Recommendation: The recommended improvement for the intersection of Snell Avenue and Branham
Lane is to provide a second northbound left-turn lane and extend the existing westbound left-turn pocket
by approximately 25 ft. to provide a total of 250 ft. of queue storage capacity.

Snell Avenue and Chynoweth Avenue

The 95th percentile queue of 300 feet for the southbound left-turn lane on Snell Avenue to eastbound
Chynoweth Avenue under buildout project conditions would exceed the existing storage capacity of 225
feet per lane.

Recommendation: The recommended improvement for the intersection of Snell Avenue and Chynoweth
Avenue is to extend the existing southbound left-turn pocket by approximately 75 ft. to provide a total of
300 ft. of queue storage capacity.


Interim Project Conditions

The close spacing of existing unsignalized intersections that could potentially serve as interim park
entrance locations will inhibit location of a new signalized entrance. The City of San Jose requires a
minimum spacing of 500 feet between signalized intersections. Therefore, the maximum park size
that could be accommodated without meeting signal warrants at a new park entrance was evaluated.
The signal warrant analysis indicates that the park size and associated trips generated by the park
would need to be reduced a minimum of 65%. With the reduction and unsignalized control, access to
the park from a new entrance along Snell Avenue would be restricted to right-turns in and out only. A
median along Snell Avenue or a physical barrier at the park entrance would also need to be
constructed to restrict left-turn access from Snell Avenue.

The restriction of park access at a new unsignalized entrance along Snell Avenue would require that
U-turn movements be made at the Branham Lane and Chynoweth Avenue intersections along Snell
Avenue. Vehicles bound for the park from northbound Snell Avenue, south of the park entrance,
would need to proceed pass the park entrance and make a U-turn at Branham Lane and head back
south on Snell Avenue and into the park entrance. Vehicles exiting the park and bound for
northbound Snell Avenue would need to make a right-turn out of the project driveway and proceed
south to Chynoweth Avenue to make a U-turn.

The restriction of access at an unsignalized park entrance may result in operational issues at the
Branham Lane and Chynoweth Avenue intersections with Snell Avenue. Therefore, operational
analysis was performed at the Branham Lane and Chynoweth Avenue intersections with Snell
Avenue to evaluate the effects of the increased demand at the intersections due to the U-turn
movements described above. The installation of a signal at the park entrance along Snell Avenue
would not alleviate operational issues at the Branham Avenue and Chynoweth intersections, but
vehicle queues would not be as severe since U-turn movements would not be required.

Snell Avenue and Branham Lane

Vehicle queue estimates indicate queues of up to 525 feet for the northbound left-turn lane under
existing conditions. The storage capacity for the northbound left-turn lane at the Branham/Snell
intersection is only 325 feet. Thus, the addition of any project traffic to the northbound left-turn
movement, as would be done by the previously described U-turn movements, will worsen existing
operational problems at the Branham Lane/Snell Avenue intersection. The addition of a second
northbound left-turn lane at the intersection will alleviate operational deficiencies, but will require
widening of Snell Avenue and signal modifications at the intersection.

Snell Avenue and Chynoweth Avenue

The Chynoweth Avenue intersection with Snell Avenue currently experiences operational issues
similar to those described at the Branham Lane intersection with Snell Avenue. Vehicle queue
estimates indicate queues of 275 feet for the southbound left-turn lane under existing conditions. The
storage capacity for the southbound left-turn lane at the Chynoweth/Snell intersection is only 225
feet. Thus, the addition of any project traffic to the southbound left-turn movement, as would be done
by the previously described U-turn movements, will worsen existing operational problems at the

Chynoweth Avenue/Snell Avenue intersection. The addition of a second southbound left-turn lane at
the intersection will alleviate operational deficiencies, and can be completed by re-striping and signal
modifications at the intersection.

Transit, Pedestrian and Bicycle Analysis

Although no deduction was applied to the estimated trip generation for the project, it can be assumed that
some of the project trips could be made by transit. Assuming up to 3% transit mode share, which is
probably the highest that could be expected, yields an estimate of approximately 9 transit trips during
both the AM and PM peak hours and 23 transit trips during the Saturday peak hour. These riders easily
could be accommodated by the existing service. The site is currently served by three bus routes and LRT
service. The nearest bus stops to the project are located near the intersection of Snell Avenue/Branham
Lane and Snell Avenue/Chynoweth Avenue. The Branham LRT station also is located near the SR
87/Branham Lane.

The bikeways within the vicinity of the project site include bike lanes on Snell Avenue, Branham Lane,
Narvaez Avenue, Lean Avenue, and Monterey Road.

VTA recommends new developments to provide bicycle parking, and provides recommended bicycle
parking rates in their VTA Countywide Bicycle Plan Technical Guidelines, September 1999. According to
VTA's recommended rates, parks/ recreational fields (such as the proposed project) should provide one
Class I bicycle parking space for every 30 employees and one Class II bicycle parking space for every 9
users during peak daylight times of peak season. The project should provide adequate parking according
to the recommended rates.

Conclusions

The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the standards set forth by the City
of San Jose level of service policy and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation (VTA) Congestion
Management Program (CMP). The study included an analysis of AM, PM, and Saturday peak-hour traffic
conditions for 38 signalized intersections and 10 directional freeway segments. In addition, the study also
included a traffic signal warrant check at one unsignalized intersection, an analysis of intersection
operations for selected signalized intersections (based on vehicle queuing for high-demand movements at
intersections).


Project Impacts
Intersection Level of Service Impacts

The results of the intersection level of service analysis under project conditions show that no study
intersections would be impacted by the project according to City of San Jose and the Congestion
Management Program (CMP) of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) level of service
standards.

Freeway Segment Impacts

The results of the freeway segment level of service analysis show that the project traffic would constitute
less than one percent of freeway capacity and would not cause an impact on any of the study segments
according to the CMP criteria for significant impacts on freeways.

Other Transportation Issues

Site Access
A main entrance along Snell Avenue will serve the project site with service and emergency access roads
along Chynoweth Avenue and Branham Lane. Operations analysis was completed to evaluate the effects
on roadway operations due to the park entrance. The operations analysis consists of signal warrant
checks, vehicle queue analysis, and signalized intersection level of service at the Branham Lane and
Chynoweth Avenue intersections along Snell Avenue since they would be most effected by the design of
the Snell Avenue park entrance.


Full Buildout Conditions

Ultimately, under buildout conditions of the park, a main project entrance would be located at the
entrance to the Life Estate just south of Obert Drive. But, an interim park entrance will need to be
located elsewhere until control of the Life Estate is obtained. The exact location of a potential interim
entrance along Snell Avenue has yet to be determined, but options are somewhat limited by the
spacing of existing intersections along Snell Avenue. It would be preferable to align the project
entrance with an opposing street, Rue Paris or Kehoe Court, on the east side of Snell Avenue.
Aligning the entrance with an opposing street would limit turn-movement conflicts and be less
obstructive to traffic flow along Snell Avenue. Rue Paris is located approximately 550 feet south of
Branham Lane. The City of San Jose requires a minimum spacing of 500 feet between signalized
intersections. Thus, the location of a project entrance opposing Rue Paris may be feasible.

Regardless of the location of the entrance, peak hour volume signal warrants indicate the need for
signalization of the Snell Avenue entrance. Along with the signalization of the entrance, project
traffic volumes indicate the need for the addition of a left-turn lane with a minimum of 250 feet of
storage capacity provided and protected phasing along Snell Avenue. A right-turn lane on Snell
Avenue into the project entrance should also be provided. Snell Avenue may require widening at the
entrance location to provide the left and right turn lanes. The widening would be dependent on
parking and bike lane removal at the selected location. A separate left-turn lane and a shared through-
right-turn lane would be needed to serve outbound project traffic.

Vehicle queue estimates indicate a 250-foot projected left-turn queue from Snell Avenue into the
project entrance. Thus, locating the driveway across from Kehoe Court may inhibit movements from
Obert Drive, which is located just 220 feet south of Kehoe Court. Therefore, should it be deemed that
a project entrance location opposite Rue Paris is not feasible by City staff, an alternative would
require the entrance to be located between Rue Paris and Kehoe Court. The entrance would need to be
located a minimum of 250 feet north of Kehoe Court to accommodate the northbound left-turn queue
into the project entrance.

Intersection Operations Analysis

The operations analysis indicated that the estimated 95th percentile vehicle queues for turn-movements at
Branham Lane and Chynoweth Avenue intersections with Snell Avenue would exceed the existing
vehicle storage capacity under project conditions.

Snell Avenue and Branham Lane

The 95th percentile queue of 575 feet for the northbound left-turn lane on Snell Avenue to westbound
Branham Lane under buildout project conditions would exceed the existing storage capacity of 325 feet
per lane. In addition, the 95th percentile queue of 250 feet for the westbound left-turn lane on Branham
Lane to southbound Snell Avenue under buildout project conditions would exceed the existing storage
capacity of 225 feet per lane.

Recommendation: The recommended improvement for the intersection of Snell Avenue and Branham
Lane is to provide a second northbound left-turn lane and extend the existing westbound left-turn pocket
by approximately 25 ft. to provide a total of 250 ft. of queue storage capacity.

Snell Avenue and Chynoweth Avenue

The 95th percentile queue of 300 feet for the southbound left-turn lane on Snell Avenue to eastbound
Chynoweth Avenue under buildout project conditions would exceed the existing storage capacity of 225
feet per lane.

Recommendation: The recommended improvement for the intersection of Snell Avenue and Chynoweth
Avenue is to extend the existing southbound left-turn pocket by approximately 75 ft. to provide a total of
300 ft. of queue storage capacity.

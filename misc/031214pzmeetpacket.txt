Legacy Oaks Subdivision                                                            February 5, 2014


I.      Site Location and Description

                The proposed residential development is comprised of approximately 44.4 acres

        located in Section 30, Township 9 South, Range 3 East, Southeastern Land District, East

        of the Mississippi River, Ascension Parish, Louisiana. The site is further located on the

        northern right of way of LA Highway 429 (Cornerview Rd.) approximately 1.1 miles

        west of the intersection with LA Highway 44 as shown on Exhibit 1, the Vicinity Map.

                The pre-developed site is an abandoned golf course with a mix of grassed park

        area and scattered trees. The site is bounded by New River Bayou and West Main Street

        on the north, residential subdivisions on the east, Cornerview Road to the South, recently

        constructed G.W. Carver School to the south and east, then residential subdivision and

        the Gonzales Country Club along the western border. The site has two existing outfalls,

        New River Bayou to the north and Bayou Francois to the south. Approximately 7.794

        acres of the site drains south to the Corenerview roadside ditch and Bayou Francois

        watershed while 36.56 acres of the site drains north to New River Bayou. Both Bayou

        Francois and New River Bayou ultimately outfall to the Amite River. The existing site

        conditions are depicted on Exhibit 3, Pre-Development Drainage Area Map.

                The development plan for this property is to construct a residential subdivision

        having 155 lots with varied dimensions, as shown in Exhibit 4, Post-Development

        Drainage Area Map. Preliminary Designs consist of two entrances from existing Legacy

        Oaks Boulevard and one entrance from West Main Street, with curb & gutter streets and

        subsurface drainage. One proposed detention pond will be utilized to reduce the 10-year

        post-development runoff from the site to the 10-year pre-development flow rate.




                                                                                       Page 1 of 7

                The subject site is located within Flood Zones X and AE as shown on the Flood

         Insurance rate Map Number 22005C0105E attached as Exhibit 2. According to FEMA,

         the 100-Year Base Flood Elevation is 10.0' (NAVD). The prevailing natural ground

         elevations range from 11' near the center of the site to approximately 8' along the

         northern and southern boundaries of the site. In accordance with Ascension Parish

         Subdivision Regulations, all minimum finished floor elevations shall meet or exceed

         elevation 12.0' (10.0' + 1.0', base flood elevation + 1.0' free board).



II.     Design Considerations and Analysis

                The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how storm water management

        techniques will be utilized to mitigate the increase in flows from the proposed

        development. HydroCAD Storm Water Modeling Software was used for calculation

        purposes. This program combines both the capabilities of the Soil Conservation Service

        Method TR-20 and TR-55. The flows produced by the 10-year and 100-year post-

        developed conditions will be mitigated to Pre-Development flows by utilizing two storm

        water detention ponds. A 24-hour storm of 10 and 100-year frequencies were analyzed

        and results can be found in the appendences.

                In order to minimize the impact due to the increased rate of storm water runoff

        from this project to the adjacent properties, existing and proposed conditions were

        analyzed. The SCS method was utilized to determine peak flows and hydrographs for

        each of these conditions.      These peak flows and hydrographs were analyzed with

        HydroCAD Storm Water Modeling Software to design a storm water detention pond

        capable of performing all the necessary detention. All detention facilities were designed




                                                                                       Page 2 of 7

        based on a 10-year 24-hour storm as required by the Ascension Parish Drainage

        Ordinance. The modeling results for a 10-year and 100-year storm can be found in the

        Appendices.

                The Pre-Development condition of this property is an abandoned golf course with

        a mix of grassed park area and scattered trees. A CN-value of 83 was used to model the

        on-site Pre-Development conditions. Approximately 14.00 acres at the interior of the site

        drains to a detention pond that was recently constructed to facilitate drainage received

        from the development of the G.W. Carver School. An existing subsurface drainage line

        extends from Legacy Oaks Boulevard to an inlet in the north school yard and then north

        to the existing detention pond. The pond outfalls through a 42" RCP into an existing

        ditch draining north to an existing 48" RCP cross-drain under West Main Street and into

        New River Bayou. The approved Drainage Impact Study and Storm Drainage As-Built

        for the G.W. Carver School were used as references for this report and are included as

        Appendices C and D.

                Approximately 4.57 acres of the site drains to the eastern property line and then

        south, into a small pond with a swale ditch outfall draining east to another pond and

        eventually into New River Bayou. An area of 8.48 acres drains west to an existing ditch,

        sloping north along the western boundary. The ditch leads into an existing subsurface

        drainage system at the rear lot lines of Greenside Estates which outfalls to an existing 24"

        RCP cross-drain under West Main Street and into New River Bayou. Along West Main

        Street approximately 8.42 acres sheet flows from the site directly into New River Bayou

        via 3 existing 12" RCP cross-drains under West Main Street. Approximately 7.79 acres

        of the site drains south, to the existing Cornerview roadside ditch and on to Bayou




                                                                                         Page 3 of 7

        Francois.    In addition, 1.084 acres of the site drains to the existing Legacy Oaks

        Boulevard subsurface system and existing pond.

                Approximately 11.18 acres of off-site area drains from the G.W. Carver School

        site to the north while approximately 3.69 acres drains south, to the Cornerview roadside

        ditch. Along the western boundary of the site, approximately 4.62 acres of off-site area

        from rear lot drainage of adjacent residential properties drain to the existing ditch sloping

        north along the western boundary and into the existing subsurface drainage system at

        Greenside Estates. From this site and immediately adjacent properties, New River Bayou

        will has a combined 10-year peak discharge of 76.4 cfs and Bayou Francois receives 24.8

        cfs.

                These conditions can be seen on Exhibit 3, the Pre-Development Drainage Area

        Map. The Pre-Development conditions for a 10-year storm are shown below:

                Under Post-Development conditions, the site is considered Residential with 155

        home sites. A CN-value of 87 is used which is consistent with a 1/4 acre average lot size

        with soil type D. Storm water generated from the post-development condition will be

        captured in sub-surface drainage systems and routed to the proposed detention pond. The

        rear lot areas along the perimeter of the developed area will be allowed to sheet flow

        directly to the existing ditches and subsurface drainage, which will reduce runoff

        received by those systems from this site. The detention pond will reduce the 10-year

        post-developed flow back to pre-development levels. Proposed Drainage is shown on

        Exhibit 4, the Post-Development Drainage Area Map. The Post-Development conditions

        and an exiting peak flow of 41.52 cfs for the 10 year storm. The 100-year storm will

        flood elevation of 10.0'.

                Due to the natural and proposed topography of the site, the large majority of the

        site will drain through the development and to the pond. Rear lot areas along the

        perimeter of the subdivision will reduce area and peak runoff rates draining directly to the

        existing ditches and subsurface drainage. The flow received from the G.W. Carver

        School site and Legacy Oaks Boulevard will be routed through the site to the proposed

        detention pond.

                From this site and immediately adjacent properties, New River Bayou will have a

        combined 10-year peak discharge of 62.0 cfs and Bayou Francois will receive 17.9 cfs.

        Peak runoff to these outfalls will be reduced by 14.4 cfs and 6.9 cfs. The calculations

        provided in the Appendix show that the proposed development and improvements

        described will reduce the 10 year peak discharges to all existing outfalls.

Legacy Oaks Subdivision                                                              February 5, 2014


III.    Recommendations and Conclusions

                The purpose of this Drainage Impact study is to identify the potential drainage

        impacts from the development of this project, and to demonstrate that the proposed storm

        water detention methods will result in no significant impacts to the adjacent watershed.

        The existing and proposed drainage conditions were analyzed and the results shown.

                As the computations indicate, the post-development 10-year peak flow from this

        site and immediately adjacent properties, the 10-year peak discharge to New River Bayou

        will be reduced by 14.4 cfs and reduced by 6.9 cfs to Bayou Francois. In fact, the project

        will result in a total decrease in the 10-year peak discharge for the regional watersheds of

        approximately 21.3 cfs. It is also demonstrated in the calculations that the 100-year

        storm event is contained within the proposed ponds without over-topping while

        maintaining a peak water surface that is less than the existing base flood elevation. This

        hydrologic analysis concludes that this development with the aforementioned storm water

        management methods will not adversely impact the upstream or downstream properties.

                                    Executive Summary
The proposed Legacy Oaks Subdivision will include 155 Single Family Detached Housing lots
and will be located on the north side of LA 429 (Cornerview Road) in Ascension Parish, Louisiana.

The analyses performed indicate that this development will not have a significant impact on LA
429 (Cornerview Road) in the vicinity of this development.

Upon completion of the development the intersection of LA 429 (Cornerview Road) at the Legacy
Oaks Lane is anticipated to operate at an acceptable Levels of Service (LOS) during the AM and
PM peaks.

In addition, this development will not have a significant impact on the LOS at the intersections of
LA 429 (Cornerview Road) at LA 44 and LA 429 (Cornerview Road) at Boudreaux Road.

I          Introduction
This study is in reference to the proposed Legacy Oaks Subdivision which is to be located on the
north side of LA 429 (Cornerview Road) in Ascension Parish, Louisiana. A vicinity map of the
development is shown in Figure 1.

The proposed development will consist of 155 single-family homes. The proposed development
will directly access LA 429 (Cornerview Road) via Legacy Oaks Lane. Legacy Oaks Lane is the
existing driveway for G.W. Carver Elementary School. A site plan is shown in Figure 2.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the development at the intersections of LA
429 (Cornerview Road) at Legacy Oaks Lane, LA 429 (Cornerview Road) at LA 44, and LA 429
(Cornerview Road) at Boudreaux Road.

Methodology

The analyses performed include the following elements:

                Determined existing traffic counts at relevant intersections to the study area from
                counts performed by Neel-Schaffer, Inc (NSI).
                Determined future generated trips using the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 9th edition.
                Distributed generated trips onto adjacent roadway and intersections for both AM and
                PM peak periods.
                Determined the capacity and Levels of Service (LOS) of unsignalized intersections
                using the "HCM 2000 Unsignalized" module of the Synchro Software (Version 8).
                Determined the capacity and Levels of Service (LOS) of signalized intersections using
                the "HCM 2000 Signalized" module of the Synchro Software (Version 8).
                Performed Left Turn Lane Warrants Analyses using Figure 2-5 of the National
                Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 457 "Evaluating

Additional traffic generated by this development was determined using the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th edition. The additional traffic
generated was determined using the land use for 155 Single Family Detached Housing dwelling
units. A summary of the AM and PM peak generated trips is shown in Table 1.

These generated traffic volumes were distributed onto LA 429 (Cornerview Road) based on
existing traffic patterns. The AM and PM peak distribution of generated volumes are shown in
Figure 4.

By adding the generated traffic from the proposed development to the existing traffic volumes on
LA 429 (Cornerview Road), existing plus generated turning volumes were estimated. These
existing and generated turning movement counts are shown in Figure 5.

IV         Analyses
Turn Lane Analysis

By using existing plus generated traffic volumes for the development, the left turn-lane warrant
analysis was performed for the intersection LA 429 (Cornerview Road) at Legacy Oaks Lane. The
left turn-lane warrant analyses were performed using National Cooperative Highway Research
Program (NCHRP) Report Number 457 entitled "Evaluating Intersection Improvements". The
analyses indicated that the generated volume does not warrants an exclusive left turn lane for the
eastbound approach on LA 429 (Cornerview Road). Detailed turn-lane analyses for the generated
volumes are provided in the Appendix.

Roadway Analysis

By using existing and existing plus generated traffic volumes for the development, roadway
analyses were performed for LA 429 (Cornerview Road) in the vicinity of the proposed
development. The roadway analyses were performed using the Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010), Version 6.40. The LOS analyses for this roadway during the AM and PM peaks upon
completion of the development are presented in Table 2. Detailed roadway analyses are provided
in the Appendix.

                                  Table 2: Roadway Analyses

                                            Build         B

These analyses indicate that this development will not have an impact on the existing LOS of LA
429 (Cornerview Road) during the AM and PM peak.

Sight Distance Analyses

NSI personnel performed intersection sight distance evaluation along LA 429 (Cornerview Road)
at the intersection of LA 429 (Cornerview Road) at Legacy Oaks Lane. The left turn and right
turn movements for the driveway were observed to have sight distances exceeding 600 feet. As
per AASHTO's "A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets" (2011), the
recommended minimum sight distance for a vehicle performing a left turn maneuver onto a major
roadway with a design speed of 45 mph is 500 ft. Similarly, the recommended sight distance for
a vehicle performing a right turn maneuver onto a major roadway is 430 ft.

Crash Analyses

The historic crash data on LA 429 (Cornerview Road) within the vicinity of the proposed
development was obtained from LADOTD. The summary of the four (4) years crash data indicates
that there are no crashes on LA 429 (Cornerview Road) within 1000 feet from the intersection of
LA 429 (Cornerview Road) and Legacy Oaks Lane.

Unsignalized Intersection Analysis

By using traffic volumes for existing and full build out of the development, unsignalized
intersection analyses were performed for the intersections of LA 429 (Cornerview Road) at Legacy
Oaks Lane and LA 429 (Cornerview Road) at Boudreaux Road during the AM and PM peaks. The
unsignalized intersection analyses were performed using the "HCM 2000 Unsignalized" module
of the Synchro Software (Version 8).

LA 429 (Cornerview Road) at Legacy Oaks Lane

The LOS analyses for this intersection during the AM and PM peaks upon completion of the
development are presented in Table 3. These analyses are presented in the Appendix.

These analyses indicate that upon completion of the development, the LA 429 (Cornerview Road)
approaches are anticipated to operate at LOS A during AM and PM peak periods. The approach
on Legacy Oaks Lane is anticipated to operate at a LOS B during AM and PM peaks. LOS B is
considered as an acceptable LOS, therefore no roadway improvements are recommended.

Notes
1. Note that the adjustment factor for level terrain is 1.00,as level terrain is one of the base conditions. For the purpose of grade adjustment, specific downgrade segments are treated as level terrain.
2. If vi(vd or vo) >=1,700 pc/h, terminate analysis--the LOS is F.
3. For the analysis direction only and for v>200 veh/h.
4. For the analysis direction only
5. Exhibit 15-20 provides coefficients a and b for Equation 15-10.
6. Use alternative Exhibit 15-14 if some trucks operate at crawl speeds on a specific downgrade.

Notes
1. Note that the adjustment factor for level terrain is 1.00,as level terrain is one of the base conditions. For the purpose of grade adjustment, specific downgrade segments are treated as level terrain.
2. If vi(vd or vo) >=1,700 pc/h, terminate analysis--the LOS is F.
3. For the analysis direction only and for v>200 veh/h.
4. For the analysis direction only
5. Exhibit 15-20 provides coefficients a and b for Equation 15-10.
6. Use alternative Exhibit 15-14 if some trucks operate at crawl speeds on a specific downgrade.

Notes
1. Note that the adjustment factor for level terrain is 1.00,as level terrain is one of the base conditions. For the purpose of grade adjustment, specific downgrade segments are treated as level terrain.
2. If vi(vd or vo) >=1,700 pc/h, terminate analysis--the LOS is F.
3. For the analysis direction only and for v>200 veh/h.
4. For the analysis direction only
5. Exhibit 15-20 provides coefficients a and b for Equation 15-10.
6. Use alternative Exhibit 15-14 if some trucks operate at crawl speeds on a specific downgrade.

Notes
1. Note that the adjustment factor for level terrain is 1.00,as level terrain is one of the base conditions. For the purpose of grade adjustment, specific downgrade segments are treated as level terrain.
2. If vi(vd or vo) >=1,700 pc/h, terminate analysis--the LOS is F.
3. For the analysis direction only and for v>200 veh/h.
4. For the analysis direction only
5. Exhibit 15-20 provides coefficients a and b for Equation 15-10.
6. Use alternative Exhibit 15-14 if some trucks operate at crawl speeds on a specific downgrade.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of this report is to determine if any geometric or operational revisions will be needed
to accommodate year 2030 traffic projections. This report documents the results of a traffic
operations study conducted for Mount Rushmore Road in Rapid City, SD. This report only
considers the effects of motor vehicles and crashes on the corridor. Consideration of bicycle and
pedestrian provisions should be addressed in the overall Mount Rushmore Corridor Study Report.

The southern limit of the study area is the intersection of Mount Rushmore Road and Cathedral
Drive. The northern limit of the study area is the intersection of Mount Rushmore Road and
Omaha Street in downtown Rapid City.

The 2030 baseline traffic volumes were developed from the 2030 Forecast Volumes map
provided by the city of Rapid City. Where gaps existed in the 2030 forecast volumes, the 2025
Forecast Volumes map and reasonable engineering judgment were used to develop the 2030
AADTs (Average Annual Daily Traffic). Minor side street traffic was estimated to be similar to
the current AADTs. The growth of side street traffic was estimated to be minimal due to the fully
developed nature of the corridor. Traffic projections were created for the following scenarios:

    ·   2030 AADT AM Peak Traffic
    ·   2030 AADT PM Peak Traffic
    ·   2030 Tourism Peak PM Peak Traffic

The current roadway geometry will provide a LOS (Level Of Service) C or better at most
intersections in this corridor. Longer storage lengths and additional lanes will be required to
facilitate the projected future traffic at these intersections:

    ·   Main Street ­          northbound double left turn lanes with 200 feet of storage
    ·   Kansas City Street ­   increase all left turn lane storage lengths
    ·   Quincy Street ­        increase northbound and southbound left turn storage lengths
    ·   Columbus Street ­      increase all left turn lane storage lengths
    ·   Franklin Street ­      increase northbound and southbound left turn storage lengths
    ·   St Patrick Street ­    increase northbound, southbound, and westbound left turn lane
                               storage lengths. Construct eastbound left turn lane.
    ·   Cathedral Drive ­      construct southbound double left turn lanes with 200 feet of
                               storage. Increase westbound left turn lane storage length.


Arterial Level of Service
An arterial level of service analysis was conducted on Mount Rushmore Road for the 2030 AM
Peak Hour, the 2030 PM Peak Hour, and the 2030 PM Peak Season Peak Hour scenarios. These
scenarios included all of the proposed recommendations. Chapter 15 of the Highway Capacity
Manual 2000 defines a level of service dependent on the urban street class and the average travel
speed. The arterial from Omaha Street to Columbus Street was classified as a class IV urban
street and from Columbus Street to Cathedral Drive as a class III urban street. This division
allows for different acceptable average travel speeds.

       AM Peak
       The central business district portion of the arterial could expect to receive a LOS C for
       northbound and LOS D for southbound traffic. The remaining portion of the arterial
       could expect to receive a LOS B for northbound and southbound traffic.

       PM Peak
       The central business district portion of the arterial could expect to receive a LOS C for
       northbound and LOS D for southbound traffic. The remaining portion of the arterial
       could expect to receive a LOS B for northbound and southbound traffic.

       PM Peak, Peak Season
       The central business district portion of the arterial could expect to receive a LOS C for
       northbound and LOS E for southbound traffic. The remaining portion of the arterial could
       expect to receive a LOS C for northbound and a LOS B for southbound traffic.

It is not recommended to add additional through lanes from Kansas City Street to Cathedral Drive
as that portion of the arterial meets or exceeds a LOS C from both intersection capacity and
arterial analysis standpoint. Additional through lanes may improve the capacity of the road from
Kansas City Street to Omaha Street but is not recommended due to feasibility.

From a crash history perspective, the following recommendations are made to reduce the
potential for collisions.
    · Consolidate driveways to reduce access to Mount Rushmore Road from adjacent
        properties.
    · Consider removing Safeway grocery store driveway from Mount Rushmore Road and
        utilize access from side streets.
    · Evaluate the entire street lighting system for conformance to AASHTO lighting levels, in
        particular from St Patrick Street to St Andrew Street. A total of 10 night-time crashes
        occurred at these intersections or between them.

With the above geometric and operational recommendations, Mount Rushmore Road is
recommended to continue to operate as a 4-lane roadway with appropriate turn lanes at
intersections. A raised median is recommended to be considered at feasible locations to further
minimize vehicular conflicts and potential crashes resulting from vehicles accessing adjacent
private driveways.

1.0     INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE

The purpose of this report is to determine if any geometric or operational revisions will be needed
to accommodate year 2030 traffic projections. This report documents the results of a traffic
operations study conducted for Mount Rushmore Road in Rapid City, SD. This report only
considers the effects of motor vehicles and crashes on the corridor. Consideration of bicycle and
pedestrian provisions should be addressed in the overall Mount Rushmore Corridor Study Report.

The southern limit of the study area is the intersection of Mount Rushmore Road and Cathedral
Drive. The northern limit of the study area is the intersection of Mount Rushmore Road and Omaha
Street in downtown Rapid City. The study will analyze the existing conditions at nine intersections
in terms of level of service (LOS) as well as arterial progression and safety throughout the corridor.
The study will also develop and analyze future traffic volumes throughout the corridor and make
recommendations to improve highway capacity and safety. Existing roadway classifications and
traffic volumes for the study area are shown in Figure 1.

Signal warrant analysis and capacity analysis conducted at study intersections were based on the
"Highway Capacity Manual" published Transportation Research Board and the "Manual of
Uniform Traffic Control Devices" published by the Federal Highway Administration.

This report is intended to provide information to decision-makers and project stakeholders to
address the traffic needs along the roadway.

2.0     EXISTING CONDITIONS

2.1     Existing Roadways

Designated as a principal arterial, Mount Rushmore Road runs north-south through the south half of
Rapid City. The roadway is also designated as US Highway 16. Six blocks of Mount Rushmore
Road is located within the central business district (CBD) of Rapid City from Omaha Street to
Columbus Street. Within the CBD, the roadway currently operates as a multi-lane urban arterial
street with various turn lanes. Outside of the CBD, the roadway from Columbus Street to Cathedral
Drive is currently designed as an urban, five-lane section including a TWLTL (two-way left turn
lane), with many access points serving a variety of small and medium sized retail, service,
hospitality, office and limited residential uses. South of Cathedral Drive, the roadway splits into a
divided highway -- two lanes for each direction of traffic. Parking is prohibited throughout the
corridor except where allowed for northbound vehicles from Clark Street to Fulton Street and
southbound in other areas. Northbound left turns are prohibited onto Fairview Street, Clark Street,
Fulton Street, and South Street from 9:00 PM to 3:00 AM. The turn prohibition is an attempt to
minimize "cruising" traffic through the adjacent West Boulevard Historic District residential area.
This report will focus on the urban portion of the corridor (from Cathedral Drive to West Omaha
Street). The study intersections with Mount Rushmore Road are (from north to south):

Omaha Street & Mount Rushmore Road ­ Actuated Signalized intersection
North Approach: One left turn lane with 160 feet of storage, two through lanes, and one right turn
                lane with 100 feet of storage
South Approach: Two left turn lanes with 180 feet of storage, two through lanes, and one right turn
                lane with 180 feet of storage
East Approach: Two left turn lanes with 310 feet of storage, two through lanes, and one
                combined through/right turn lane
West Approach: Two left turn lanes with 285 feet of storage, three through lanes, and one right
                turn lane

The DM&E Railroad maintains a railroad crossing on Mount Rushmore Road between Omaha
Street and Main Street. DM&E Railroad reported that they are typically running two (2) trains daily
- 1 each to and from Belle Fourche (10 trains weekly) - 1 each to and from Pierre on Monday
through Friday. This results in the railroad crossing being occupied four times per day Monday
through Friday. The length of train varies from 10 to 100 cars depending on time of year and
various factors such as weather delays. The average train length was reported to be 2500 feet (50
cars at 50 feet) with a speed of 10 mph. At a speed of 10 mph a 2500 foot long train would occupy
the railroad crossing for 2 minutes 51 seconds. However, the impacts to vehicular progression on
Mount Rushmore Road and other impacted roads may be felt for some time after a train has cleared
the railroad crossing; potentially having negative impacts to emergency vehicle response times.

Main Street & Mount Rushmore Road ­ Pre-timed Signalized intersection
North Approach: One through lane, one combined through/right turn lane

2.2     Existing Traffic Volumes

To understand the current traffic volumes on the area roadways, the latest traffic information was
taken from several sources:
    · AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic) from the South Dakota Department of
        Transportation traffic volume maps in 2005 and 2006
    · Raw count data from 2001-2006 from Rapid City MPO (Metropolitan Planning
        Organization)
    · Peak hour turning movement count data ­ surveyed October/November 2007

2.3     2007 Capacity Analysis

Mount Rushmore Road was analyzed with existing geometry and the 2007 turning movement
counts collected in October and November of 2007. The 2007 capacity analysis includes the
following scenarios:
    · 2007 AADT AM Traffic
    · 2007 AADT PM Traffic
    · 2007 Tourism Peak PM Traffic

The 2007 peak hours were multiplied by a factor of 0.97 to convert to equivalent AADT peak hours
as directed by the city of Rapid City. These AADTs were divided by a factor of 0.86 to convert to
Peak Summer Tourism ADTs as directed by the city of Rapid City. Each traffic signal's phases,
timing, and offsets were not altered in order to reflect the current conditions. Each intersection was
analyzed under each scenario and the results from the capacity analysis are shown in Figures 2
through 10. The 2007 capacity analysis worksheets can be found in Appendix B. An overview of
each intersection's performance is below. If an approach received a LOS C or better it is not
mentioned below.

Omaha Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 2)
Overall LOS C may be expected under each scenario. Northbound and Southbound traffic on
Mount Rushmore Road may expect LOS D in all scenarios.

Main Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 3)
The westbound PM Peak Hour volume was roughly 1.7 times larger than the AM Peak Hour. This
leads to a worsening of the LOS for the intersection in the PM. The PM Peak Hour during peak
season may expect an overall intersection LOS D with the northbound approach on Mount
Rushmore Road expecting a LOS E.

Kadrmas Lee & Jackson


St Joseph Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 4)
The eastbound AM Peak Hour volume was roughly 1.23 times larger than the PM Peak Hour. The
intersection may expect to receive a LOS C for the AM scenario and a LOS B for the PM scenario.
The eastbound approach may expect a LOS D during the peak season scenario, AM Peak Hour.

Kansas City Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 5)
The overall LOS for this intersection under all scenarios was C or better. Under the PM Peak Hour,
the eastbound approach received a LOS E and the westbound approach received a LOS C. Under
the peak season scenario PM Peak Hour, the eastbound approach received a LOS F and the
westbound approach received a LOS D.

Quincy Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 6)
The northbound and southbound left-turning movement received a LOS B for the AM and PM peak
hour scenarios. The eastbound and westbound approaches received a LOS F for the AM peak hour
peak season. The 2007 traffic counts do not warrant a signal based on MUTCD signal warrants for
traffic volumes.

Columbus Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 7)
The overall LOS for this intersection under all scenarios was B or better. The east bound approach
received a LOS D for the AM Peak Hour and peak season AM Peak Hour scenarios.

Franklin Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 8)
The overall LOS for this intersection under all scenarios was A and each approach received a LOS
of C or better.

St Patrick Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 9)
The overall LOS for this intersection under all scenarios was C. Under the peak season AM Peak
Hour scenario, the westbound and eastbound approaches received a LOS D.

Cathedral Drive & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 10)
Under the peak season AM Peak Hour scenario, the southbound approach received a LOS F, the
westbound approach received a LOS E, and the overall intersection LOS was D.

3.0                         FUTURE CONDITIONS

The traffic analysis includes the following scenarios:

      ·                     2030 AADT AM Peak Traffic
      ·                     2030 AADT PM Peak Traffic
      ·                     2030 Tourism Peak PM Peak Traffic

3.1                         Assigned Volume Calculations

The 2030 baseline traffic volumes were developed from the 2030 Forecast Volumes map provided
by the city of Rapid City. If the volumes were not indicated on the 2030 map, the 2025 Forecast
Volumes map and reasonable engineering judgment were used to develop the 2030 AADTs
(Average Annual Daily Traffic). The growth of side street traffic was estimated to be minimal due
to the fully developed nature of the corridor and the topographical limitations to development to the
west. Minor side street traffic was estimated as the current AADT on the west approach and
minimal growth was applied to the east approach. To determine volumes for the Tourism Peak
scenario, the 2030 AADTs were divided by a factor of 0.86 to derive Tourism Peak ADTs (Average
Daily Traffic) as instructed by the city of Rapid City. The 2030 traffic volumes are displayed on
Figure 1.

The volume of traffic during the peak hour compared to the 24-hour volume is known as the k-
factor. The 2007 AM and PM peak hour volumes were compared to the 2006 24-hour counts
compiled by the city of Rapid City in order to determine the existing k-factor. The study area k-
factors are displayed below in Table 1.

The AM and PM k-factors in the study are range from 0.05 to 0.09. The 2030 k-factors are assumed
to be similar to the existing k-factors. A k-factor of 0.07 was used for the AM peak hour in the
CBD and 0.08 outside of the CBD on Mount Rushmore Road. A k-factor of 0.07 was used for the
PM peak hour in the CBD and 0.09 outside of the CBD on Mount Rushmore Road.

Each approach's peak hour traffic was distributed as left turn movements, through movements, and
right turn movements using similar proportions as the 2007 turning movements. Engineering
judgment was used to adjust the volumes that did not appear consistent with the current turning
movements and to balance the amount of vehicles exiting an intersection with the amount of
vehicles entering an upstream intersection. The projected 2030 turning movements can be found in
Appendix C.

3.2      Truck Traffic/ESALs

With the construction of the Southeast Connector (US Highway 16B) at the intersection of Mount
Rushmore Road and Catron Boulevard approximately 3 miles south of Cathedral Drive, truck
traffic through the Mount Rushmore Road corridor has been reduced. Traffic data from the 2007
peak hour counts calculated truck traffic as low as 0.6% to as high as 1.9% at each intersection. For
Equivalent Single Axel Load (ESAL) calculations, the truck traffic was conservatively assessed as
3% of total traffic. Table 2 below displays the calculations and the results.

3.3      2030 Signal Warrant Analysis

A signal warrant analysis was conducted at the intersection of Quincy Street and Mount Rushmore
Road determined that a signal was not warranted for 2007 at this intersection based on capacity.
Traffic counts were only taken for 3 hours in the AM and 3 hours in the PM but only the PM peak
hour volume was above the threshold for Warrant 1B while no other hourly volumes met the
minimums set for Warrants 1, 2 or 3. The 2030 AADT projects similar minor street volumes on
Quincy Street; thus no signal may be warranted in the future due to these Warrants.

A signal warrant analysis was conducted at the intersection of Flormann Street and Mount
Rushmore Road. The most recent traffic data available was from 2000. Those data indicate volume
of traffic on the minor road did not satisfy the minimum threshold for any volume-based signal
warrant. It is recommended to conduct traffic counts at this location to determine if a signal is
warranted.

3.4     2030 Capacity Analysis

Mount Rushmore Road was analyzed with existing geometry and the 2030 projected traffic. The
existing cycle length of 84 seconds was maintained in the CBD while all other intersections were
assumed to operate as actuated/coordinated signals. Each traffic signal's phases, timing, and offsets
were optimized for the 2030 volumes. Both leading and lagging left turns were implemented to
improve traffic progression through the network. Intersection geometry and lane configuration was
improved as needed to meet a LOS C for the intersection. The results from the capacity analysis
based upon recommended geometry are shown in Figures 2 through 10. The capacity analysis
worksheets can be found in Appendix D. The storage lengths are provided as both the minimum
length required to store the turning vehicles and as the recommended length that considers the
queue storage length of the adjacent through lane. The recommend length provides an opportunity
for the turning vehicles to enter their respective turn lane without waiting for the through lane's
standing queue to discharge through the intersection. The recommend lengths will be displayed
below while the minimum lengths can be found in the corresponding figures. The following is a
summary of each analyzed intersection.

Omaha Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 2)
The current geometric lane configuration is adequate to achieve a LOS C in 2030. Adjustments to
the intersection's phases, timing, and offsets may also be required.

Main Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 3)
North Approach: No geometric changes needed.
South Approach: The northbound double left turn lanes may require 200 feet of storage.
East Approach: No geometric changes recommended.
West Approach: No geometric changes recommended.

St Joseph Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 4)
North Approach: No geometric changes recommended.
South Approach: No geometric changes recommended.

West Approach: No geometric changes recommended.

St Patrick Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 9)
North Approach: Increase the southbound left turn lane storage to 350 feet.
South Approach: Increase the northbound left turn lane storage to 150 feet.
East Approach:      Increase the westbound left turn lane storage to 230 feet.
West Approach: Construct eastbound left turn lane with 100 feet of storage. Additional left turns
                    are generated from a coffee shop located in the northwest quadrant of this
                    intersection constructed after the turning movements were recorded. This lane
                    will oppose the existing westbound left turn lane and may require reconstruction
                    of curb and gutter to facilitate construction.
                    Install actuated coordinated controller to increase efficiency of the signal.

Cathedral Drive & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 10)
North Approach: Construct southbound double left turn lanes with 200 feet of storage.
South Approach: Yield control on northbound channelized right turn lane.
East Approach:    Increase the westbound left turn lane storage to 180 feet. Construct additional
                  eastbound receiving lane.
West Approach: No geometric changes recommended.

Arterial Level of Service
An arterial level of service analysis was conducted for the 2030 AM Peak Season and the 2030 PM
Peak Season scenarios. The worksheets can be found in Appendix E. These scenarios were
analyzed with all of the proposed recommendations in place. Chapter 15 of the Highway Capacity
Manual 2000 gives outlines as to acceptable levels of service dependent on the urban street class
and the average travel speed. The central business district from Omaha Street to Columbus Street
was classified as a class IV urban street and Columbus Street to Cathedral Drive was classified as a
class III urban street. This division allows for different acceptable average travel speeds.

        AM Peak
        The central business district portion of the arterial could expect to receive a LOS C for
        northbound and LOS D for southbound traffic. The remaining portion of the arterial could
        expect to receive a LOS B for northbound and southbound traffic.

        PM Peak
        The central business district portion of the arterial could expect to receive a LOS C for
        northbound and LOS D for southbound traffic. The remaining portion of the arterial could
        expect to receive a LOS B for northbound and southbound traffic.

        PM Peak, Peak Season
        The central business district portion of the arterial could expect to receive a LOS C for
        northbound and LOS E for southbound traffic. The remaining portion of the arterial could
        expect to receive a LOS C for northbound and a LOS B for southbound traffic.

3.5     2030 Progression Analysis

The existing cycle length of 84 seconds in the CBD was used at all signals for the 2030 progression
analysis. All signals outside of the CBD were assumed to be actuated/coordinated. The master
controller location would be chosen by the City of Rapid City.

AM Peak Hour
The progression analysis was completed with the AM peak hour traffic. Synchro assumes an
arbitrary starting point of zero seconds and calculates the following offsets:

Mt Rushmore Rd/Omaha St:                 Not coordinated ­ heavy traffic volume
Mt Rushmore Rd/Main St:                  0 second offset, north-south beginning of green
Mt Rushmore Rd/St. Joseph St:            8 second offset, north-south beginning of green
Mt Rushmore Rd/Kansas City St:           8 second offset, north-south beginning of green
Mt Rushmore Rd/Columbus St:              39 second offset, north-south beginning of green
Mt Rushmore Rd/Franklin St:              83 second offset, north-south beginning of green
Mt Rushmore Rd/St Patrick St:            81 second offset, north-south beginning of green
Mt Rushmore Rd/Cathedral Dr:             20 second offset, north-south beginning of green

With these settings during 90th percentile traffic conditions, the northbound arterial band is 28
seconds and the southbound arterial band is 16 seconds.

PM Peak Hour
The progression analysis was completed with the PM peak hour traffic. Synchro assumes an
arbitrary starting point of zero seconds and calculates the following offsets:

Mt Rushmore Rd/Omaha St:                 Not coordinated ­ heavy traffic volume
Mt Rushmore Rd/Main St:                  30 second offset, north-south beginning of green
Mt Rushmore Rd/St. Joseph St:            34 second offset, north-south beginning of green
Mt Rushmore Rd/Kansas City St:           39 second offset, north-south beginning of green
Mt Rushmore Rd/Columbus St:              67 second offset, north-south beginning of green
Mt Rushmore Rd/Franklin St:              26 second offset, north-south beginning of green
Mt Rushmore Rd/St Patrick St:            80 second offset, north-south beginning of green
Mt Rushmore Rd/Cathedral Dr:             27 second offset, north-south beginning of green

With these settings during average traffic conditions the northbound arterial band is 15 seconds, the
southbound would have an arterial band of 26 seconds.

4.0   CRASH ANALYSIS

Crash data for Mount Rushmore Road from 2004 to 2006 was analyzed to determine crash trends
and possible counter-measures to address these trends. Figure 11 on the following page displays
each crash in the corridor graphically and symbolically displays the manner of collision.

  · 323 crashes from January 1, 2004 to December 31 2006
  · Crashes decreased from 126 in 2004, 105 in 2005 and 92 in 2006. This most likely can be
    attributed to the decrease in overall traffic along the corridor during this time period.
  · Accident rate is 547 per hundred-million vehicle miles (HMVM) versus statewide average of
    197 per HMVM for the years 2004 to 2006. Data was not readily available for South Dakota
    urban streets, but for comparative purposes Wisconsin DOT averaged 322 accidents per
    HMVM for their urban streets.
  · 39% of all crashes were rear end collisions Figure 12 below displays each crash type as a
    percentage of all crashes in the corridor.
  · 44% of all crashes were angle collisions. The angle collisions can be broken down further as:
          o 18% of all crashes were left- turn collisions at intersections.
          o 14% of all crashes were right-angle collisions at intersections
          o 8% of all crashes occurred at driveways

  · Only 4 crashes involved parking maneuvers on St Joseph and Main Street.
  · 1 fatality along the corridor during the three year time period. This crash involved an
    intoxicated pedestrian stepping into the roadway and being struck by a vehicle. This crashed
    occurred at the intersection of St Cloud Street and Mount Rushmore Road. This crash
    occurred at night
  · 28% of all crashes involved injuries. The South Dakota statewide average for US/State
    Highways in cities was 39% for 2004 to 2006.
  · 7% of all crashes involved incapacitating injuries.
  · 18% of all crashes occurred at night but under lit conditions.

  · 4% of all crashes involved alcohol which is below the statewide average of 6.8% of all
    crashes.
  · A concentration of crashes occurred mid-block between Flormann Street and St Anne Street.
    This location is adjacent to Safeway grocery store driveway


4.1       Recommended Counter-Measures

      ·   Consolidate driveways to reduce access to Mount Rushmore Road from adjacent
          properties.
      ·   Consider removing Safeway grocery store driveway from Mount Rushmore Road and
          utilize access from side streets.
      ·   Evaluate the entire street lighting system for conformance to AASHTO lighting levels, in
          particular from St Patrick Street to St Andrew Street. A total of 10 night-time crashes
          occurred at these intersections or between them.

5.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The purpose of this report is to document the results of a traffic operations study conducted along
Mount Rushmore Road from Omaha Street to Cathedral Drive in Rapid City, SD. A vicinity map is
shown in Figure 1. The traffic study considers the impacts of year 2030 traffic volumes to the
existing roadway network. The following intersections were analyzed with future traffic conditions.
    · West Omaha Street
    · Main Street
    · St Joseph Street
    · Kansas City Street
    · Quincy Street
    · Columbus Street
    · Franklin Street
    · St Patrick Street
    · Cathedral Drive
    · US Highway 16B (Truck Bypass) / Catron Boulevard

The recommendations below are needed to achieve a LOS C during the largest 2030 peak hour at
each intersection. Each traffic signal's phases, timing, and offsets were optimized for the 2030
volumes. Leading and lagging left turns were considered to improve traffic flow through the
network.

Omaha Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 2)
The current geometric lane configuration is adequate to achieve a LOS C in 2030. Adjustments to
the intersection's phases, timing, and offsets may also be required.

Main Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 3)
North Approach: No geometric changes needed.
South Approach: The northbound double left turn lanes may require 200 feet of storage.
East Approach: No geometric changes recommended.
West Approach: No geometric changes recommended.

St Joseph Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 4)
North Approach: No geometric changes recommended.
South Approach: No geometric changes recommended.
East Approach: No geometric changes recommended.
West Approach: No geometric changes recommended.

Kansas City Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 5)
North Approach: Increase the southbound left turn lane storage to 100 feet.
South Approach: Increase the northbound left turn lane storage to 260 feet.
East Approach: Increase the westbound left turn lane storage to 140 feet.
West Approach: Increase the eastbound left turn lane storage to 160 feet.

Quincy Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 6)
Signal may not be warranted.
North Approach: Increase the southbound left turn lane storage to 100 feet.
South Approach: Increase the northbound left turn lane storage to 100 feet.
East Approach: No geometric changes recommended.
West Approach: No geometric changes recommended.

Columbus Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 7)
North Approach: Increase the southbound left turn lane storage to 340 feet.
South Approach: Increase the northbound left turn lane storage to 100 feet.
East Approach: Increase the westbound left turn lane storage to 110 feet.
West Approach: Increase the eastbound left turn lane storage to 100 feet.

Franklin Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 8)
North Approach: Increase the southbound left turn lane storage to 100 feet.
South Approach: Increase the northbound left turn lane storage to 100 feet.
East Approach: No geometric changes recommended.
West Approach: No geometric changes recommended.

St Patrick Street & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 9)
North Approach: Increase the southbound left turn lane storage to 350 feet.
South Approach: Increase the northbound left turn lane storage to 150 feet.
East Approach:      Increase the westbound left turn lane storage to 230 feet.
West Approach: Construct eastbound left turn lane with 100 feet of storage. Additional left turns
                    are generated from a coffee shop located in the northwest quadrant of this
                    intersection constructed after the turning movements were recorded. This lane
                    will oppose the existing westbound left turn lane and may require reconstruction
                    of curb and gutter to facilitate construction.
                    Install actuated coordinated controller to increase efficiency of the signal.

Cathedral Drive & Mount Rushmore Road (Figure 10)
North Approach: Construct southbound double left turn lanes with 200 feet of storage.
South Approach: Yield control on northbound channelized right turn lane.
East Approach:    Increase the westbound left turn lane storage to 180 feet. Construct additional
                  eastbound receiving lane.
West Approach: No geometric changes recommended.

Arterial Level of Service
An arterial level of service analysis was conducted for the 2030 AM Peak Season and the 2030 PM
Peak Season scenarios. The worksheets can be found in Appendix E. These scenarios were
analyzed with all of the proposed recommendations in place. Chapter 15 of the Highway Capacity
Manual 2000 gives outlines as to acceptable levels of service dependent on the urban street class
and the average travel speed. The central business district from Omaha Street to Columbus Street
was classified as a class IV urban street and Columbus Street to Cathedral Drive was classified as a
class III urban street. This division allows for different acceptable average travel speeds.

        AM Peak
        The central business district portion of the arterial could expect to receive a LOS C for
        northbound and LOS D for southbound traffic. The remaining portion of the arterial could
        expect to receive a LOS B for northbound and southbound traffic.

        PM Peak
        The central business district portion of the arterial could expect to receive a LOS C for
        northbound and LOS D for southbound traffic. The remaining portion of the arterial could
        expect to receive a LOS B for northbound and southbound traffic.

        PM Peak, Peak Season
        The central business district portion of the arterial could expect to receive a LOS C for
        northbound and LOS E for southbound traffic. The remaining portion of the arterial could
        expect to receive a LOS C for northbound and a LOS B for southbound traffic.

It is not recommended to add additional through lanes from Kansas City Street to Cathedral Drive
as that portion of the arterial meets or exceeds a LOS C from both intersection capacity and arterial
analysis standpoint. Additional through lanes may improve the capacity of the road from Kansas
City Street to Omaha Street but is not recommended due to feasibility.

From a crash history perspective, the following recommendations are made to reduce the potential
for collisions.
    · Consolidate driveways to reduce access to Mount Rushmore Road from adjacent
         properties.
    · Consider removing Safeway grocery store driveway from Mount Rushmore Road and
         utilize access from side streets.
    · Evaluate the entire street lighting system for conformance to AASHTO lighting levels, in
         particular from St Patrick Street to St Andrew Street. A total of 10 night-time crashes
         occurred at these intersections or between them.

With the above geometric and operational recommendations, Mount Rushmore Road is
recommended to continue to operate as a 4-lane roadway with appropriate turn lanes at
intersections. A raised median is recommended to be considered at feasible locations to further
minimize vehicular conflicts and potential crashes resulting from vehicles accessing adjacent
private driveways.

                           CHAPTER 1 ­ INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE
This manual will be used to establish minimum standards for conducting traffic engineering studies on
roads under the jurisdiction of the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT). In addition, local
governmental agencies are recommended and encouraged to use the Traffic Studies Manual as a guideline
in conducting traffic engineering studies within their area of responsibility.

AUTHORITY
Federal Code of Regulations, 23 CFR 655.603; Wyoming Statute 31-5-112; Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices for Streets and Highways, 2009 Edition (MUTCD); Wyoming Department of
Transportation Operating Policy, Policy Number 25-1.

SCOPE
This manual affects the WYDOT Traffic Program, WYDOT District Traffic Offices, WYDOT Planning
Program, and anyone else who performs traffic studies on the state highway system in Wyoming.

BACKGROUND
Section 1A.09 of the MUTCD recommends that early in the processes of location and design of roads and
streets, engineers should coordinate such location and design with the design and placement of the traffic
control devices to be used with such roads and streets. The decision to use a particular device at a
particular location should typically be made on the basis on an engineering study or the application of
engineering judgment. The MUTCD requires that an engineering study shall be performed by an
engineer, or by an individual working under the supervision of an engineer, through the application of
procedures and criteria established by the engineer. An engineering study shall be documented.
This manual will provide a more efficient, standardized process for compiling and analyzing data
collected during traffic engineering study activities. This manual will serve as a basic tool for district
traffic operations studies and as a guideline for local agencies in Wyoming.
This manual will constitute the minimum standards for use in conducting traffic engineering studies on
state highways in Wyoming. The manual's chapters and data collection sheets are not shown in any
particular order. Accordingly, sections applicable to a specific situation or concern should be considered
on an individual basis.
District Traffic Engineers should ensure that studies performed by their staff or by consultants conform,
as a minimum, to the practices and techniques prescribed by this manual and shall incorporate the manual
by reference in consultant contract documents.
This manual was originally based on the organization and format of the Florida Department of
Transportation's Manual on Uniform Traffic Studies (FDOT Manual Number 750-020-007), January
2000 (as revised March 2003). Copies of the original Florida manual can be purchased from Florida
Department of Transportation, Maps and Publications, 605 Suwannee Street, Mail Station 12,
Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0450, Phone (850) 414-4050, Fax (850) 487-4099. This Wyoming adaptation
of that manual has significantly modified the original manual.

1.      DISTRIBUTION
The official recipients of this manual will be the District Traffic Engineers, District Traffic Technicians,
Traffic Program managers and staff.

      CHAPTER 2 ­ TRAFFIC SIGNAL STUDY PROCEDURE
2.1   PURPOSE
(1)   The purpose of this chapter is to present to the traffic engineer a guide for conducting
      comprehensive traffic signal studies. The information, techniques, and instructions presented
      herein were formulated from the MUTCD and experiences of practicing traffic engineers.
(2)   This manual is not all-inclusive in addressing traffic signal study situations; rather, it is a general
      guide for the traffic engineer to follow while investigating conditions and circumstances
      regarding the installation of a new traffic signal or improvement of the operation of an existing
      traffic signal. This manual will begin with an alleged problem concerning traffic control at a
      particular location. The observation of the symptoms, establishment of areas of concern,
      collection and analysis of data, and preparation of a traffic signal study report will be outlined in
      subsequent chapters.
(3)   This chapter provides a logical and systematic data collection procedure for investigating traffic
      signal requirements which allows the traffic engineer to use judgment to analyze local conditions
      and interpret data as effectively and efficiently as possible with the resources available. By
      following this chapter it is intended to minimize the collection of unnecessary or inappropriate
      data and/or to reduce the number of trips to the field to collect additional data.

2.2   LEARNING OF THE CONCERN
(1)   The problem facing traffic engineers at this point has yet to be defined. This is the stage during
      which the traffic engineer receives notice from the public, a civic organization, business, etc.,
      regarding their desire or need for a traffic signal to be installed or modified at a given site. Often,
      the traffic engineer or one of his/her staff has observed the situation, or another governmental
      agency has brought it to their attention.
(2)   Regardless of the source, the traffic engineer is obligated to respond. However, to respond in a
      professional manner requires some systematic investigation of the situation. Before a full scale
      investigation is launched requiring a large amount of manpower and equipment, the traffic
      engineer should conduct an observation of the site. If a great deal of delay is encountered, the
      engineer should contact the reporting party about the action to be initiated.

2.3   OBSERVATION OF CONCERN SYMPTOMS
(1)   During the initial observation or field investigation of the site, a number of items should be noted.
      The preparation of a condition diagram (Chapter 5) should be made at this time if none exists for
      the site. The condition diagram shows the location of traffic control devices, intersection
      geometry, and other physical features. If the engineer has an existing condition diagram, it
      should be updated if necessary. Note that it is not necessary for this diagram to be drawn to scale.
(2)   In addition to preparing a condition diagram, the engineer should observe the operational
      characteristics of the location and note any unusual or significant circumstances. Ideally, this
      observation should be made during the hours of the day when the operational concerns were
      reported to have occurred. Photographs of each approach often save subsequent trips back to the
      study location.
(3)   With an understanding of the operation and a representation of conditions at the location, the
      engineer is in a position to determine if a real problem exists or no further investigation is
      warranted. If it is decided after the field investigation that no problem exists, the engineer should
      respond either in writing or verbally to that person responsible for the initial contact regarding the
      site. However, should it be determined that further investigation is warranted, the engineer
      should continue the investigation. At this point, the engineer should notify the concerned

TRAFFIC STUDIES MANUAL                            Page 3                                      March 9, 2011
      party(ies) of his/her intention to investigate the site for possible signalization and inform them of
      an approximate completion date.

2.4   ESTABLISHING BASIC AREAS OF CONCERN
(1)   Establishing the basic area(s) of concern draws a great deal from the traffic engineer's experience
      and judgment. Some cases can be easily diagnosed, such as excessive vehicle delays. Other
      cases are more subtle in nature. Of course, the issue under consideration may be the result of
      more than one basic area of concern.
(2)   Decisions made by the traffic engineer at this point will provide the basis for data collection
      efforts to be made during the investigation. The areas of concern can be grouped into three basic
      categories: vehicle, pedestrian, and crashes and are addressed in this section. Warrants for signal
      installation, taken from the MUTCD, will be correlated with the studies indicated. This manual
      will be of assistance in conducting many of the studies indicated as we have noted the appropriate
      chapter or section.
2.4.1 VEHICLE
(1)   A vehicle problem can normally be diagnosed during the field observation without great
      difficulty. Some of these characteristics are: excessive queue lengths, slow queue dissipation
      rates, and/or large traffic volumes using the intersection, etc.
(2)   Typically, the data collected to determine the extent of a vehicle problem includes one or more of
      the following:
      (a)     Hourly approach volumes ­ from the turning movement count (Chapter 4) ­ for the
              highest 8 hours of an average day, as required for MUTCD Warrants 1 ­ 5 and 7 ­ 9
              (MUTCD Sections 4C.02 ­ 4C.06 and 4C.08 ­ 4C.10)
      (b)     Stop sign delay study (Chapter 8)
      (c)     Verification ­ from the condition diagram (Chapter 5) ­ that the distance to the nearest
              signal in each direction is greater than 1000 feet as required for MUTCD Warrant 6
              (MUTCD Section 4C.07), and the location meets the recommended signal spacing in
              WYDOT's access policy (see Chapter II of the WYDOT Access Manual).
      (d)     Determination ­ from the condition diagram (Chapter 5) ­ of the clear storage distance as
              required for MUTCD Warrant 9 (MUTCD Section 4C.10)
      (e)     Travel time and delay study (Chapter 14)
2.4.2 PEDESTRIAN
(1)   A pedestrian problem can also be diagnosed through field observation. However, the severity of
      this problem is difficult to ascertain without field data collection.
(2)   The types of data which may be needed for this investigation are summarized below:
      (a)     Turning movement count (Chapter 4), that includes hourly approach volumes for the
              highest 8 hours of an average day as required for MUTCD Warrants 1, 2, 3 and 8, and
              pedestrian volumes, as required for MUTCD Warrants 4 and 5
      (b)     Pedestrian gap study (Chapter 9) as required for MUTCD Warrants 4 and 5
      (c)     Verification ­ from the condition diagram (Chapter 5) ­ that the distance to nearest
              crosswalk, or signalized intersection is greater than 300 feet as required for MUTCD
              Warrants 4 and 5
      (d)     Characteristics of pedestrians such as age, disability, average walking speed, etc.



TRAFFIC STUDIES MANUAL                           Page 4                                      March 9, 2011
2.4.3 CRASHES
(1)     The determination of an intersection's crash potential during a short field observation is difficult.
        Some obvious features of a high crash location may be damaged sign supports or excessive tire
        skid marks; however, the number of crashes is not normally shown by the previous features. The
        quickest and cheapest method of determining if crashes are a problem (e.g., significantly higher
        than average for similar intersections), is to review past crash records for a minimum of three but
        preferably five years. Crashes many times can also be related to the previously described
        problems of vehicle and pedestrian delay, yet poor geometric design may be the overriding factor.
(2)     The following information can be used to further define a crash problem:
        (a)     Hourly approach volumes and pedestrian volumes ­ from the turning movement count
                (Chapter 4) ­ for the highest 8 hours of an average day, as required for MUTCD Warrants
                1 ­ 5 and 7 ­ 9
        (b)     Crash records/rates as required for MUTCD Warrant 7
        (c)     Collision diagram (Chapter 7)
        (d)     Speed study (Chapter 13) may be required for MUTCD Warrants 1-4 and 7
        (e)     Intersection sight distances (Chapter 6)
        (f)     Geometrics: vertical and horizontal
        (g)     Pavement condition for skid resistance
        (h)     Roadside hazards
        (i)     Existing positive guidance through signing and marking
        (j)     Existing highway lighting
        (k)     Traffic conflict investigation and analysis
(3)     This list of data to be collected for each of the three basic areas of concern is neither all inclusive
        nor suggested as a minimum effort. Keep in mind that data is required for justification (warrant
        analysis) and other data is required for design and operation. Data for justification; however, is
        not mutually exclusive of the data required for design and operation.
(4)     The engineer should not attempt to collect any of the data elements listed unless he is certain it
        will ultimately be required for the study. In fact, certain elements should not be collected until
        others have been reviewed. For example, hourly approach volumes (preferably fifteen minute
        volumes) should be counted for analysis of traffic signal warrants, which is generally necessary
        for each of the three areas of concern. Once the warrant analysis has been completed and the
        problem(s) has been identified (and before any turning volumes are counted), the machine counts
        should also be examined carefully to determine the control periods of interest. These periods of
        interest are the peak and off-peak periods for which the various signal operation plans will be
        designed.

2.5     DATA COLLECTION, REDUCTION AND SUMMARIZATION
Conducting the previously mentioned studies generates a large volume of data. The study sheets and
techniques available in this manual are designed to allow for use as field collection sheets, reduction
sheets, and summary sheets, thus reducing the amount of paperwork and time required to finalize field
work (A convenient manner in which to summarize and thus facilitate interpretation of the data required
for the MUTCD signal warrants is to complete the Traffic Signal Warrants worksheet, Form TR-01, in
Chapter 3). For more information regarding data collection, reduction, and summarization see the
individual chapters contained herein.



TRAFFIC STUDIES MANUAL                              Page 5                                      March 9, 2011
2.6   DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
(1)   Once the appropriate data for the warrant analysis has been collected, it is the traffic engineer's
      responsibility to analyze and interpret it.
(2)   Application of the Traffic Signal Warrants worksheet can be made in a straightforward manner
      and provides the traffic engineer with information concerning the minimum conditions for
      justifying signal installation. Instructions for use of the Traffic Signal Warrants worksheet (Form
      TR-01) are included in Chapter 3.
(3)   Further explanation of the individual warrants can be found in Part 4 of the MUTCD.
(4)   Engineering judgment plays an important role in the decision to signalize an intersection. The
      traffic engineers need a thorough knowledge and understanding of any local conditions which
      may or may not support the need for signalization. Situations may arise when a traffic signal is
      best not installed even though one of the eight warrants may be met. Such a condition may exist
      when minimum traffic volumes are present at a location, but signalization would severely
      interrupt mainline movement to serve a relatively small side street movement. Some additional
      considerations should be made by the engineer when minimum warrants have been met to insure
      that installation of a signal does not create a greater problem. These considerations include, but
      are not limited to the following:
      (a)     Development of excessive queues on the major street
      (b)     Queue dissipation rates
      (c)     Spacing between adjacent signalized intersections
      (d)     Highway and intersection geometry (turn lanes)
      (e)     Distance to pedestrian crossings and distance pedestrians have to cross
(5)   Conversely, local conditions may, on rare occasions, dictate installation of a signal when the
      minimum volume warrants are not met for the required eight hours. An example of this situation
      is the entrance to a plant or office complex which generates sufficient traffic such as work trips,
      to meet volume warrant criteria for several hours of the day (but less than the full eight hours) for
      at least each weekday. These locations should be designed with an operation plan which may
      include flashing operation during hours when full signal control is not justified. See Warrants 2
      and 3 (Sections 3.9 and 3.10) in Chapter 3.
(6)   It is very important to note that even when a traffic signal is justified (e.g., it satisfies one or more
      warrants), it may not contribute to the safety and efficiency of the roadway. Closely spaced
      intersections in high volume corridors could all meet volume warrants, but signals are not
      desirable at every cross street. Signals can be poorly designed, ineffectively placed, improperly
      operated, and poorly maintained. Any of these conditions can negate the benefits intended by the
      traffic signal installation. The traffic engineer should also be increasingly aware of energy
      conservation and include these thoughts when signalization is considered.

2.7   PREPARATION AND APPROVAL OF STUDY REPORT
(1)   Proper documentation of all activities that have taken place from the initial allegation of a
      problem through the warrant analysis is extremely important. A traffic signal study report which
      includes the following elements (as needed) should be prepared:
      (a)     Cover/Title page that is signed and sealed
      (b)     Description and map of intersection being considered
      (c)     Existing conditions and a diagram (sketch) ­ see Chapter 5
      (d)     Crash analysis and Collision Diagram ­ see Chapter 7

TRAFFIC STUDIES MANUAL                            Page 6                                       March 9, 2011
      (e)     Warrant analysis ­ see Chapter 3
              · Statement of use of 70 or 100 percent requirements
              · Discussion of number of approach lanes used in the analysis
              · Discussion of how right turns are considered in the analysis
              · Analysis discussion of Warrants 1-9 (only those applicable)
              · Discussion of delay study
              · Discussion of capacity analysis with Synchro or HCS+
      (f)     Recommendations (including sketch if applicable)
      (g)     Supplemental information or data to be submitted (as appropriate)
              · Completed Traffic Signal Warrants worksheets (Form TR-01)
              · Turning movement counts for the existing intersection (8 hour - A.M., Noon and
                 P.M. peaks)
              · Projected turning movement counts for the proposed intersection (A.M., Noon and
                 P.M. peaks) (if applicable)
              · 24-hour machine counts
              · Pedestrian counts (8 hours)
              · Color photos of each approach
              · Projected traffic data for new intersection (if applicable)
              · Pertinent supplemental information if needed
              · Computer program outputs
(2)   Guidelines for the content and format of this report are necessary to insure uniform report
      preparation procedures and to expedite report review time.
(3)   The traffic signal study report should conclude one of the following: (1) no problem exists and
      therefore no traffic signal is warranted; (2) a problem exists, but the solution is not a traffic
      signal; (3) a problem exists and a traffic signal will correct or reduce the problem; or (4) a
      problem exists and a traffic signal in conjunction with other improvements will correct or reduce
      the problem.
(4)   In the first case, the traffic signal study should be terminated and the party initiating the request
      should be notified. It may also be beneficial to disseminate further information explaining the
      basis of the decision. In the second case, the traffic signal study should also be terminated,
      another study (non-signal related) should be initiated to resolve the problem, and proper
      notification should be given. In the third or fourth case, the study should be initiated to resolve
      the problem, and proper notification should be given, also the study should be handed over to the
      engineer(s) responsible for design. It is again advisable at this point to notify the party initiating
      the request so that they are kept informed of the progress of the study.

2.8   DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TRAFFIC SIGNAL DESIGN
(1)   The design stage includes all activities that take place after justification of a new traffic signal
      installation has been made or the modification of the operation of the existing signal is required.
      These activities, which lead up to the traffic signal design reconnaissance report, include the
      following:
      (a)     Collect additional data (if needed)
      (b)     Develop alternatives
      (c)     Evaluate alternatives
      (d)     Select "Best" alternative
      (e)     Design improvement

TRAFFIC STUDIES MANUAL                           Page 7                                      March 9, 2011
(2)   For the installation of a new traffic signal the additional data collection will generally be limited
      to the turning volume counts for 15-minute time periods required for developing the signal
      operating plan and controller timings. Data collected for the signal warrants are of course
      available if needed. For modification of an existing signal the data available is often dated, so it
      may also be necessary to collect some of the data elements outlined previously in addition to the
      turning volumes. In any event it is advisable to develop alternative concepts prior to the
      collection of additional data.
(3)   The alternative development, evaluation, and selection steps are significant steps in themselves
      and are, therefore, only addressed in general terms in this manual. However, the basic approach
      is presented in order to provide the user with guidelines necessary to properly conduct the traffic
      signal study.
(4)   All reasonable alternative concepts should be considered by the engineer. These concepts should
      then be screened based on any known constraints such as funding, future programmed
      construction, etc. All of the alternatives determined to be feasible by the engineer should then be
      evaluated using the optimization and simulation computer programs.
(5)   The first step is an isolated intersection analysis. Synchro is a valuable program with a Highway
      Capacity Manual interface that can be used for design, analysis, and evaluation of isolated
      intersections. By specifying appropriate commands and parameters, this program can select
      optimal phase patterns and timings (cycle lengths and splits). Each alternative can be analyzed by
      the measures of effectiveness included in the output reports. Several alternatives can also be
      evaluated by comparative analysis to determine the best alternative. The Engineer of Record
      should be responsible for any model result.
      (a)     When modeling intersections using Synchro or HCS+, it is imperative that the factors
              used in the analysis reflect actual Wyoming driving conditions. For example, the default
              saturation flow rate should be set to 1600 vehicles per lane per hour of green. Field
              observation of the traffic characteristics may be used to justify increasing the saturation
              flow rate to 1700 where conditions indicate that driver behavior at the intersection is
              more aggressive than the typical Wyoming intersection.
      (b)     With the majority of intersections in Wyoming being located in relatively sparsely
              populated areas, the traffic volumes can tend to fluctuate excessively throughout the day
              and throughout the peak periods of the day. Therefore, when modeling intersections
              using Synchro or HCS+, the actual peak hour factor for each movement should be used
              for the analysis, rather than relying on the software's default peak hour factors.
(6)   If the intersection is included in a linear arterial highway under study for progression, is part of a
      grid network, or is part of an interchange with coordinated signals at each ramp terminal, a
      Synchro analysis should be conducted. Synchro optimizes signal progression and is capable of
      design and analysis of multiphase, actuated, as well as two phase, fixed time signal control.
(7)   It is advisable to examine all legitimate phasing patterns and determine the optimal cycle length
      for an intersection regardless of whether it is isolated or part of a network. This may result in
      significant time savings, because model output can be used to determine input values and ranges
      necessary to run Synchro more effectively and more efficiently.
(8)   An economic analysis (cost effectiveness) should be conducted in conjunction with the computer
      analyses and before proceeding to the implementation stage. Unfortunately, constraints beyond
      the engineer's control may sometimes not permit implementation of the best alternative.
(9)   Although input from the local agency is usually received through the traffic signal request, in all
      cases the conceptual design should reflect any special needs or conditions the local agency
      requires.

TRAFFIC STUDIES MANUAL                           Page 8                                       March 9, 2011
2.9   TRAFFIC SIGNAL RECONNAISSANCE REPORT
(1)   Upon completion of the conceptual traffic signal design process, a design reconnaissance report
      should be prepared. This report should include the following elements as a minimum:
      (a)     All elements of the traffic signal study report (show report in the Appendix)
      (b)     Additional data collected, if any
      (c)     Description of alternatives
      (d)     Description of analyses (including appropriate output from Synchro, SIDRA, VisSim or
              HCS+)
      (e)     Recommendations of engineer
      (f)     Work to be performed
      (g)     Approval of recommended concept
(2)   This report should be distributed to the State Traffic Engineer, both Assistant State Traffic
      Engineers, Traffic Studies Engineer, District Traffic Engineer and Electrical Operations Engineer.
      If the project involves geometric changes, such as ADA modifications, corner radii improvements
      or the addition of turn lanes, the Highway Development Engineer should be included in the
      distribution because Project Development will need to be involved with the geometric project
      design and administration.

2.10 IMPLEMENTATION
(1)   Actual implementation of the improvement should take place as soon as possible after the traffic
      signal study report and design reconnaissance report stages. Conditions change with time, and if
      too much time lapses before implementation it may be necessary to repeat the entire traffic signal
      study procedure. For this reason it is wise to plan traffic signal studies in close conjunction with
      the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP). If this is not done the result may be an
      improvement that does not match the conditions at the site.
(2)   Following implementation, the engineer should always visit the site to determine if the traffic
      signal is operating as designed. As a minimum, he should observe the operation during each
      critical time period, keeping in mind the original concern and/or any other concerns identified in
      the Traffic Signal Study Report. It is always a good idea to drive through the intersection from
      all approaches and to make any critical turning maneuvers. The Operational Review Signalized
      Intersection Checklist (Form TR-18) provides a convenient form on which to check each of the
      signal components and note any concerns or deficiencies (see Chapter 10).
(3)   In some cases, data collection may be necessary to determine if and how well the improvement is
      operating. This is particularly true for the after condition of a before and after study, where crash
      data (Chapter 7), travel time and delay data (Chapter 14), etc., are required.
(4)   It is also advisable to follow through on the implementation of a traffic signal with an educational
      program, preferably before any ground is broken, to increase public awareness of the change.
      This should result in improved safety and efficiency during the transition, and it draws attention
      to the traffic engineering activities, particularly safety and energy efficiency, that benefit the area.

      CHAPTER 3 ­ TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS
3.1   PURPOSE
(1)   Section 4C.01 of the MUTCD requires that an engineering study of traffic conditions, pedestrian
      characteristics, and physical characteristics of the location shall be performed to determine
      whether installation of a traffic control signal is justified at a particular location.
(2)   This chapter provides a procedure to determine input into the decision of whether or not
      conditions warrant the installation or the continued operation of a traffic signal.

3.2   TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS
(1)   The MUTCD requires that the investigation of the need for a traffic control signal shall include an
      analysis of factors related to the existing operation and safety at the study location and the
      potential to improve these conditions, and the applicable factors contained in the following traffic
      signal warrants:
              · Warrant 1, Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume
              · Warrant 2, Four-Hour Vehicular Volume
              · Warrant 3, Peak Hour
              · Warrant 4, Pedestrian Volume
              · Warrant 5, School Crossing
              · Warrant 6, Coordinated Signal System
              · Warrant 7, Crash Experience
              · Warrant 8, Roadway Network
              · Warrant 9, Intersection Near a Grade Crossing
(2)   Traffic signals should not be installed unless one or more of these nine warrants are satisfied.
      Because these are minimum requirements, satisfaction of a traffic signal warrant or warrants shall
      not in itself require the installation of a traffic control signal. Delay, congestion, crash
      experience, confusion, or other evidence of the need for right-of-way assignment must be shown.
      Geometric changes which may eliminate the need for a signal should be considered.
(3)   A warrant is a set of criteria which can be used to define the relative need for, and
      appropriateness of, a particular traffic control device (i.e., STOP or YIELD sign, traffic signal,
      etc.). Warrants are usually expressed in the form of numerical requirements such as the volume
      of vehicular or pedestrian traffic. A warrant normally carries with it a means of assigning
      priorities among several alternative choices. There are two fundamental concepts involved in this
      determination:
      (a)     The most effective traffic control device is that which is the least restrictive while still
              accomplishing the intended purpose. For instance, geometric changes alone may negate
              the need for a traffic signal.
      (b)     Driver response to the influences of a traffic control device has been previously identified
              by observation, field experience, and laboratory tests under a variety of traffic and driver
              conditions.
(4)   Warrants should be viewed as guidelines, not as absolute values. Satisfaction of a warrant is not
      a guarantee that the device is needed. The warrant analysis process is just one of the tools to be
      used in determining if a traffic signal is warranted.
(5)   The application of warrants is effective only when combined with comprehensive analysis and
      evaluation of available pertinent information, and the application of appropriate principles,
      provisions, and practices as contained in the MUTCD and other sources, for the purpose of
      deciding upon the applicability, design, operation, or installation of a traffic control device as

TRAFFIC STUDIES MANUAL                          Page 11                                     March 9, 2011
      noted in the definition of Engineering Study in Section 1A.13 of the MUTCD. In all cases, at
      least one or more warrants must be fully met before a traffic signal installation is considered.
(6)   Most of the warrants have criteria associated with the number of approach lanes and reduced
      criteria for rural and/or higher speed locations. Each traffic signal warrant analysis must
      determine which criteria apply based on the number of lanes and whether or not the reduced
      warrant criteria apply. Engineering judgment must be used to determine when to apply the
      reduced criteria and the appropriate number of lanes to use for the warrant analysis.

3.3   APPLICATION OF REDUCED (70%) WARRANT CRITERIA
(1)   The MUTCD allows for the application of reduced (70%) traffic signal warrant criteria at certain
      rural and/or higher speed locations. The application of the 70% criteria is applicable for
      intersections that lie within the built-up area of an isolated community having a population of less
      than 10,000, or where the posted or statutory speed limit or the 85th-percentile speed on the major
      street exceeds 40 mph.
(2)   The application of the 70% criteria based on population only applies to communities in Wyoming
      that do not currently have a signalized intersection (reduction based on speed may still apply). It
      also does not apply to intersections lying outside the incorporated limits of a community, but
      within the urban planning boundaries (typically within 3 miles, or otherwise as determined by the
      Planning Program).
(3)   The application of the reduced warrant criteria based on speeds will be based on the posted speed
      limit. If the speed limit is posted less than 40 mph, the reduced criteria do not apply based on
      speeds (reduction based on population may still apply). If the posted speed limit is 45 mph or
      greater, the reduced criteria applies. If the speed limit is posted at 40 mph, a spot speed study
      (see Chapter 13) should be conducted at the intersection to determine whether or not the 85th-
      percentile speed is greater than 40 mph.

3.4   APPROACH LANES
(1)   Engineering judgment must be exercised in applying various traffic signal warrants to cases
      where approaches consist of one lane plus one right or one left-turn lane. The site specific traffic
      characteristics will dictate whether an approach should be considered as a one-lane approach or a
      two-lane approach.
(2)   For a minor street approach with one lane plus a left-turn lane, engineering judgment would
      indicate that it should be considered a one-lane approach if the traffic using the left-turn lane is
      minor. In such a case, the total traffic volume approaching the intersection should be applied
      against the signal warrants as a one-lane approach. The approach should be considered two lanes
      if approximately half of the traffic on the approach turns left and the left-turn lane is of sufficient
      length to accommodate all left-turn vehicles.
(3)   Similar engineering judgment and rationale should be applied to a street approach with one-lane
      plus a right-turn lane. In the case of a right-turn lane, engineering judgment must also be
      exercised relative to the degree of conflict of minor street right-turn traffic with traffic on the
      major street. Thus, right-turn traffic should not be included in the minor street volume if the
      movement enters the major street with minimal conflict. In such cases, the approach would be
      evaluated as a one-lane approach and only the traffic in the through/left-turn lane considered.
(4)   In some cases the minor street approach may not be striped with multiple lanes, but may be of
      sufficient width (typically 18 feet or more) to allow right-turning traffic to pass to the right of any
      left-turn or through traffic and complete their turn with little delay. In this case, the approach
      should be considered a single lane approach, but the right turn volumes from the minor street
      should not be included in the warrant analysis.

TRAFFIC STUDIES MANUAL                           Page 12                                      March 9, 2011
(5)   Minor street approaches having a single left-turn/through lane and a free flow right-turn lane
      should be considered a single lane approach, and the right turn volumes from the minor street
      should not be included in the warrant analysis.
(6)   Major street approaches having single through lanes with separate left or right-turn lanes are
      typically considered one-lane approaches for the warrant analysis.

3.5   VOLUMES
(1)   The volumes of traffic used in a full signal warrant analysis should be the actual turning
      movement count (see Chapter 4) taken for the highest 8 to 12 hours in an average day (a weekday
      representing traffic volumes normally and repeatedly found at the location).
(2)   A review of the latest machine counts should be conducted first in order to determine:
      (a)     The need for a turning movement count (i.e., if the volumes are too low then 8 to 12
              hours of manual count are not needed and the warrant analysis may be completed based
              on the machine counts only); and
      (b)     The appropriate time periods for conducting the turning movement count.
(3)   In all of the warrants where hourly volumes are to be entered, any hourly period may begin on
      any quarter hour (7:15, 7:30, 7:45 etc.), as long as there is no overlap among warranted hours.
(4)   An engineering study should consider the effects of the right-turn vehicles from the minor-street
      approaches. Engineering judgment should be used to determine what, if any, portion of the right-
      turn traffic is subtracted from the minor street traffic count when evaluating the count against the
      signal warrants.
(5)   The following factors should be considered when applying engineering judgment to determine the
      portion of right-turn volumes included in the minor street volume:
      (a)     Number of lanes on the minor street approach
      (b)     Presence or absence of exclusive right-turn lane
      (c)     Presence or absence of free flow right-turn lane
      (d)     Availability of gaps in major street traffic
      (e)     Sight distance available to right-turning vehicles
      (f)     Percentage of minor street traffic which turns right
      (g)     Pedestrian volumes
(6)   Section 3.4 includes several instances where right turn volumes would not be included in the
      warrant analysis.
(7)   If free flow right-turn lanes are present, the right turn volumes should not be included in the
      warrant analysis. This includes both free flow right-turns from the major street (right turn
      volumes deducted from the major street volumes), and from the minor street (right turn volumes
      deducted from the minor street approach volumes).
(8)   When a minor street approach consists of a single lane, but right-turn volumes exceed 50% of the
      total traffic on the approach, some of the right-turn traffic can proceed with little delay, but some
      will be impeded by through or left-turn traffic. Also, the presence of the right turn traffic, though
      it may be able to turn with little delay adds delay to the through and left-turn traffic. In this case,
      all of the left-turn and through volume plus 50% of the right turn volume should be considered in
      the warrant analysis and the single lane approach criteria should be used.

3.6      PRELIMINARY SCREENING
(1)      Prior to conducting a full traffic signal warrant analysis, existing two-way average daily traffic
         (ADT) volume data should be reviewed to determine if the intersection experiences enough
         traffic to possibly meet any traffic signal warrants. The ADT volumes for all state highway
         routes are available in the latest Vehicle Miles Book published by the Department's Planning
         Program each year. The ADT volumes for most major city streets are also available from the
         Department's Planning Program. Table 3-1 shows the minimum ADT volumes below which it is
         impossible to meet the 8-hour traffic signal warrant criteria.
(2)      The Equivalent ADT volumes indicated in the table are the minimum hourly volumes required to
         meet the 8-hour warrant criteria multiplied by 8 (the number of hours that must meet the
         minimum volume criteria). If either street at the intersection experiences traffic volumes below
         the equivalent ADT for the applicable number of lanes and application of the full (100%) or
         reduced (70%) criteria, it can be concluded that the intersection will not warrant the installation of
         a traffic control signal, and the signal warrant study can be terminated. The requestor should be
         notified of these findings per Chapter 2.

(3)      For the volumes in Table 3-1 to meet the 8-hour warrant criteria, all traffic during the day would
         have to be concentrated into an 8-hour period, with no other traffic during the remaining 16 hours
         of the day. Based on the normal distribution of traffic volumes throughout the day, the actual
         two-way ADT volumes needed to meet the 8-hour warrant criteria is significantly higher than
         those indicated in Table 3-1. Normal daily traffic distribution was analyzed to determine the
         typical 24-hour traffic volumes that would be likely to meet the 8-hour warrant criteria. Table 3-
         2 shows the results of that analysis. If the roadway volumes on both approaches meet or exceed
         the traffic volumes shown on Table 3-2 for the applicable number of lanes and application of the
         full (100%) or reduced (70%) criteria, it does not necessarily mean that a traffic signal is
         warranted and should be installed, but indicates that the intersection should be further analyzed
         for possible signal warrants (a full warrant analysis should be conducted per the remainder of this
         chapter). If the two-way ADT volumes on the approaches are less than those shown on Table 3-
         2, engineering judgment should be used to decide whether the traffic volumes are close enough to
         need full warrant analysis or the volumes are too low to meet the warrant criteria.

3.7      TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANTS WORKSHEET
(1)      The Traffic Signal Warrants worksheet is an Excel spreadsheet that has been developed to
         simplify the traffic signal warrant analysis procedure. It is designed for the easy input of the
         volume data and pertinent intersection conditions and to compile the results in a clear and
         understandable format for use in justifying the installation of a new signal or the removal of an
         existing signal.
(2)      This form summarizes data previously collected at the intersection. This data is drawn from a
         larger set of data which can later be used to determine the proper design and operation should
         signalization be warranted.
(3)      Most of the data entry for the Traffic Signal Warrants worksheet takes place on the "Input Sheet".
         All fields should be filled in as applicable. Figure 3-1 gives an example of the "Input Sheet".
         (a)       It is important that the city name be entered and spelled correctly because the spreadsheet
                   determines whether or not to apply the reduced warrant criteria based on the name of the
                   city. If the intersection is within the urban area boundary of an incorporated city, even
                   though it may be outside of the actual corporate limits, the city's name should be used.
         (b)       Enter the names and information for each of the approaches. Select "Yes" or "No" from
                   the dropdown lists in each of the blanks after a question.
         (c)       The posted speed limit on the major street must be input for proper application of the
                   speed-based warrant reductions. If the speed limit is posted at 40 mph, the spreadsheet
                   will ask if the 85th-percentile speed exceeds 40 mph. This should be determined by a
                   spot speed study (see Chapter 13). Select "Yes" if the 85th percentile speed is greater
                   than 40 mph, or "No" if it is 40 mph or less, from the dropdown list next to the question
                   that is highlighted in red text.
         (d)       The number of lanes per approach should be determined per Sections 3.4 and 3.5.

      (e)     If "Yes" is selected for the question, "Is there a designated school crossing across the
              uncontrolled roadway at this intersection?", then a pedestrian gap study (see Chapter 9)
              should be performed and the results tabulated on the Pedestrian Gap Study form (Form
              TR-12) and the School Crossing Warrant Sheet (Form TR-01a) should be completed,
              which can be found under the "Wrnt 5" tab of the Traffic Signal Warrants worksheet.
      (f)     If "Yes" is selected for the question "Is there a railroad grade crossing within 140 feet of
              the intersection on a STOP controlled approach?", then the Intersection Near a Grade
              Crossing Warrant Sheet (Form TR-01b) should be completed, and which can be found
              under the "Wrnt 9 Input", "Fig 4C-9" and "Fig 4C-10" tabs of the Traffic Signal
              Warrants worksheet.
      (g)     The traffic volumes can be input manually, but the recommended method is to copy the
              volumes directly from the PetraPro software program. To prepare the count data, first
              arrange the approaches in the order of Northbound, Southbound, Eastbound and
              Westbound using the approach wizard tool. Then, if all of the count intervals start on the
              hour (i.e., XX:00), change the interval length to 60 minutes using the "Tools" dropdown
              menu in PetraPro, then selecting "Change Interval Length" and "60 minutes". If any of
              the count intervals were started on the quarter hour (i.e., XX:15, XX:30 or XX:45), the
              count data will need to be moved to where it starts on the hour in order for the PetraPro
              software to process the count data into full one-hour blocks. Also, any count intervals
              that form incomplete hours must be deleted prior to changing the interval length.




(4)   Once all of the data is entered on the "Input Sheet", additional data for the Crash Experience
      warrant must be entered on "Pg 3" of the worksheet.
      (a)     Under sub-section A, select "X" if adequate trial of alternatives to reduce crashes has
              failed to reduce the crash experience at the intersection.


TRAFFIC STUDIES MANUAL                          Page 17                                     March 9, 2011
      (b)     Under sub-section B, enter the number of correctable crashes that have occurred at the
              intersection each year, and select "X" if there have been more than five correctable
              crashes in a 12 month period. Crashes that are considered susceptible to correction are
              typically crashes involving either crossing or left-turning vehicles from the minor street
              being struck by through vehicles on the major street. See Chapter 7 regarding crash
              studies.




(5)   The peak four-hour volumes must be plotted on Figure 4C-1 if the full warrant criteria is used, or
      Figure 4C-2 if the reduced (70%) criteria is used. The peak one-hour volumes must be plotted on
      Figure 4C-3 if the full warrant criteria is used, or Figure 4C-4 if the reduced (70%) criteria is
      used. These figures can be found under the "Pg 5 Full" or "Pg 5 70%" tabs in the Traffic Signal
      Warrants worksheet. Figures 4C-1 and 4C-3 are included on the "Pg 5 Full" sheet for studies that
      use the full warrant criteria, and Figures 4C-2 and 4C-4 are included on the "Pg 5 70%" sheet for
      studies that use the reduced (70%) warrant criteria.
      (a)     First, determine which sheet applies and select the respective tab.
      (b)     On the blank worksheet, each figure contains green horizontal lines underlining each of
              the possible lane configurations. Delete the lines that do not apply, leaving the applicable
              lane configuration used for the analysis underlined in green.
      (c)     On the blank worksheet, Figures 4C-1 and 4C-2 include four horizontal and four vertical
              lines each of red, blue and green colors which are to be used to plot the appropriate points
              for analysis. Figures 4C-3 and 4C-4 include one horizontal and one vertical line each of
              red, blue and green colors. The lines are color coded to mean:
              · Red = warrant criteria is met
              · Blue = warrant criteria is close to being met (i.e., the point fall on or just below the
                  curve)
              · Green = warrant criteria is not met.
      (d)     To the right of each of the figures, a table of data indicates the peak eight hours of data
              analyzed in the worksheet, including how much above or below the curve the point falls
              for each hour. Positive numbers typically fall above the curve, while negative numbers
              typically fall below the curve. This data is color coded as previously discussed to

TRAFFIC STUDIES MANUAL                         Page 18                                     March 9, 2011
               indicate the appropriate color of line to use to plot that hour's data. Due to the scale of
               the figure and inherent errors in plotting the points, some positive numbers will show as
               blue to indicate that the point is on, or nearly on, the curve, but not above the curve as
               required for the warrant to be met. The table also indicates how long the associated
               horizontal and vertical lines need to be to accurately represent the respective volumes on
               the figures.
       (e)     Determine the four highest points to be plotted on the Four-Hour Warrant curves from the
               four highest numbers under the "Volume Above/Below Criteria" heading. The color
               coding will indicate how many points will be plotted in each color. Delete the extra
               horizontal and vertical lines leaving just four horizontal and four vertical lines of the
               appropriate colors.
       (f)     Set the length of each of the lines by right-clicking on the line, selecting Size and
               Properties, and entering the length of the line from the table to the right of the figure. Set
               the length of line for horizontal lines in the Width field, and for vertical lines in the
               Height field.




       (g)     Move each of the horizontal and respective vertical lines into their appropriate locations
               on the figure to accurately represent each of the plotted points.
(6)    If the School Crossing warrant applies, complete the School Crossing Signal Warrant Sheet
       (Form TR-01a) under the "Wrnt 5" tab. This first requires the completion of a pedestrian gap
       study (see Chapter 9).
(7)    If the Intersection Near a Grade Crossing warrant applies, complete the Intersection Near a Grade
       Crossing Warrant worksheet (Form TR-01b). Enter the pertinent information on the "Wrnt 9
       Input" sheet, then plot the highest point on the applicable figure (i.e., Figure 4C-9 for a single
       lane over the crossing or Figure 4C-10 for multiple lanes over the crossing).
(8)    Figure 3-2, consisting of 6 pages, gives an example of a completed traffic signal warrant analysis
       using the Traffic Signal Warrants worksheet.

3.8     WARRANT 1, EIGHT HOUR VEHICULAR VOLUME
The Eight Hour Vehicular Volume signal warrant is broken into three conditions that are detailed in
Section 4C.02 of the MUTCD.
The Minimum Vehicular Volume, Condition A, is intended for application at locations where a large
volume of intersecting traffic is the principal reason to consider installing a traffic control signal.
The Interruption of Continuous Traffic, Condition B, is intended for application at locations where
Condition A is not satisfied and where the traffic volume on a major street is so heavy that traffic on a
minor intersecting street suffers excessive delay or conflict in entering or crossing the major street.
The combination of Conditions A and B is intended for application at locations where Condition A is not
satisfied and Condition B is not satisfied and should be applied only after an adequate trial of other
alternatives that could cause less delay and inconvenience to traffic has failed to solve the traffic
problems.

3.9     WARRANT 2, FOUR-HOUR VEHICULAR VOLUMES
The Four-Hour Vehicular Volume signal warrant is intended to be applied where the volume of
intersecting traffic is the principal reason to consider installing a traffic control signal. The warrant
conditions are detailed in Section 4C.03 of the MUTCD.

3.10 WARRANT 3, PEAK HOUR
The Peak Hour signal warrant is intended for use at a location where traffic conditions are such that for a
minimum of 1 hour of an average day, the minor street traffic suffers undue delay when entering or
crossing the major street. The warrant conditions are detailed in Section 4C.04 of the MUTCD.
This signal warrant shall be applied only in unusual cases, such as office complexes, manufacturing
plants, industrial complexes, or high-occupancy vehicle facilities that attract or discharge large numbers
of vehicles over a short time.

3.11 WARRANT 4, PEDESTRIAN VOLUME
The Pedestrian Volume signal warrant is intended where the traffic volumes on a major street are so
heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delays in crossing the major street. The warrant conditions
are detailed in Section 4C.05 of the MUTCD.

3.12 WARRANT 5, SCHOOL CROSSING
The School Crossing signal warrant is intended for application where the fact that school children cross
the major street is the principal reason to consider installing a traffic control signal. The warrant
conditions are detailed in Section 4C.06 of the MUTCD.
Before a decision is made to install a traffic control signal, consideration shall be given to the
implementation of other remedial measures, such as warning signs and flashers, school speed zones,
school crossing guards, or a grade-separated crossing.

3.13 WARRANT 6, COORDINATED SIGNAL SYSTEM
Progressive movement in a coordinated signal system sometimes necessitates installing traffic signal at
intersections where they would not otherwise be needed in order to maintain proper platooning of
vehicles. The warrant conditions for this warrant are detailed in Section 4C.07 of the MUTCD.
In order for this warrant to apply, there must be a signalized intersection more than 1,000 feet away in
each direction along the coordinated signal corridor.

3.14 WARRANT 7, CRASH EXPERIENCE
The Crash Experience signal warrant conditions are intended for applications where the severity and
frequency of crashes are the principal reasons to consider installing a traffic control signal. The warrant
conditions for this warrant are detailed in Section 4C.08 of the MUTCD.

3.15 WARRANT 8, ROADWAY NETWORK
Installing a traffic signal at some intersections might be justified to encourage concentration and
organization of traffic flow on a roadway network. The warrant conditions for this warrant are detailed in
Section 4C.09 of the MUTCD.

3.16 WARRANT 9, INTERSECTION NEAR A GRADE CROSSING
The Intersection Near a Grade Crossing signal warrant is intended for use at a location where none of the
conditions described in the other eight traffic signal warrants are met, but the proximity to the intersection
of a grade crossing on an intersection approach controlled by a STOP or YIELD sign is the principal
reason to consider installing a traffic control signal. The warrant conditions for this warrant are detailed
in Section 4C.10 of the MUTCD.

              CHAPTER 4 ­ TURNING MOVEMENT COUNT
4.1     PURPOSE
The purpose of a turning movement count (TCM) is to summarize the counts of vehicle movements
through an intersection during certain time periods. This type of volume summary is used in making
decisions regarding the geometric design of the roadway, sign and signal installation, signal timing,
pavement marking, traffic circulation patterns, capacity analysis, parking and loading zones, and vehicle
classification.

4.2     MANUAL TURNING MOVEMENT COUNT
(1)     Manual turning movement counts should be collected using an electronic count board such as a
        JAMAR Technologies DB-400, TDC-8 or TDC-12 traffic data collector, and processed through
        JAMAR's PetraPro software.
(2)     The count header on the turning movement count should be filled in completely. Enter the Street
        Name of each roadway and orient the intersection by indicating the approach direction of each
        approach (i.e., Northbound, Southbound, Eastbound and Westbound).
(3)     For turning movement counts that will be used for signal warrant analysis, the approaches should
        be in order of Northbound, Southbound, Eastbound and Westbound from left to right.
(4)     Briefly describe the Weather Conditions and include any Comments that may influence the
        results of the data being collected. For example, a stalled vehicle that may temporarily restrict a
        vehicle movement during a time period should be noted.
(5)     Figure 4-1 gives an example of a turning movement count that was completed using a TDC-8
        count board and processed through the PetraPro software.

4.3     AUTOMATED TURNING MOVEMENT COUNT
Automated turning movement counts are collected using Miovision Technologies Polemount Video
Collection Units (VCUs), and the data is processed and retrieved on Miovision's Traffic Data Online
(TDO) servers.

                   CHAPTER 5 ­ CONDITION DIAGRAM
5.1   PURPOSE
(1)   The purpose of the condition diagram is to show the intersection and the conditions within the
      surrounding area as it exists. The diagram should include the intersection alignment, items such
      as buildings, sidewalks, trees, light poles, fire hydrants, stop signs, number of lanes, lane use if
      required, approach speed limits, and distance to the next signal in each direction (if applicable),
      associated with the streets forming the intersection. The condition diagram should show the
      length of all exclusive lanes and associated tapers.
(2)   The condition diagram provides the engineer with details of field conditions and helps investigate
      the need for changes to existing traffic control devices. The diagram should also be part of an
      intersection crash analysis.

5.2   COMPLETING THE CONDITION DIAGRAM
(1)   The location information should be entered so that the intersection is thoroughly identified. The
      state, U.S., or county route numbers and street names for both streets should be included if
      applicable, as well as the County, City, Date, and Person(s) preparing the diagram. Orient the
      intersection by indicating north with a north arrow.
(2)   All items associated with the streets should be drawn using representative symbols. The diagram
      should also include the width and surface type of the streets, the grades (if 5 percent or more), and
      traffic control devices. All measurements should be as accurate as possible and indicated on the
      diagram. The usual distance measured from the intersection is 80 to 100 feet; however, in those
      cases where pertinent signing or pavement markings concerning the intersection (such as `Stop
      Ahead') occur in advance of the intersection in question, those conditions should be diagrammed
      and distances indicated with a "broken arrow." Reasonable judgment should be used to decide
      the distance away from the intersection to include elements in the condition diagram.
(3)   Show all lanes and the movements allowed/required from each lane. Include lane widths, full-
      width turn bay lengths and turn bay taper lengths.
(4)   Note the posted speed limit on all approaches and the distance to the next traffic signal in each
      direction (if applicable).
(5)   Figure 5-1 gives an example of a completed condition diagram.

                 CHAPTER 6 ­SIGHT DISTANCE STUDIES
6.1     PURPOSE
(1)     Sight distance is the length of roadway visible to a driver. The three types of sight distance
        common in roadway design are intersection sight distance, stopping sight distance, and passing
        sight distance. This chapter will discuss intersection sight distance and stopping sight distance.
        Information on passing sight distance can be found in Chapter 12 of this manual and in Chapter 3
        of the AASHTO A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (Green Book).
(2)     A sight distance study at an intersection includes four key steps:
        ·       Determine the minimum recommended sight distance.
        ·       Obtain or construct sighting and target rods.
        ·       Measure current sight distances and record observations.
        ·       Perform sight distance analysis.

6.2     INTERSECTION SIGHT DISTANCE
(1)     The driver of a vehicle approaching or departing from an intersection should have an
        unobstructed view of the intersection, including any traffic control devices, and sufficient lengths
        along the intersecting highway to permit the driver to anticipate and avoid potential collisions
        (Maze and Plazak 2000). These unobstructed views form triangular areas known as sight
        triangles.
(2)     A typical intersection is divided into areas between each leg known as quadrants. Sight triangles
        are the specified areas along an intersection's approach legs and across the included corners (see
        Figures 6-1 and 6-2 for an illustration). These areas should be clear of obstructions that might
        block a driver's view of conflicting vehicles or pedestrians. The two types of sight triangles are
        approach sight triangles and departure sight triangles (AASHTO, Green Book, 2004).
6.2.1 APPROACH SIGHT TRIANGLES
Approach sight triangles provide the driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection an unobstructed view
of any conflicting vehicles or pedestrians. These triangular areas should be large enough that drivers can
see approaching vehicles and pedestrians in sufficient time to slow or stop and avoid a crash. Approach
sight triangles are illustrated in Figure 6-1.

6.2.2 DEPARTURE SIGHT TRIANGLES
Appropriate departure sight triangles provide adequate sight distance for a stopped driver on a minor
roadway to depart from the intersection and enter or cross the major roadway. These sight triangles
should be provided in each quadrant of a controlled intersection. Departure sight triangles are illustrated
in Figure 6-2.

                                              (Source: CTRE)

6.2.3 OBSTRUCTIONS WITHIN SIGHT TRIANGLES
(1)     To determine whether an object is a sight obstruction, consider both the horizontal and vertical
        alignment of both roadways, as well as the height and position of the object (AASHTO Green
        Book). For passenger vehicles, it is assumed that the driver's eye height is 3.5 feet and the height
        of an approaching vehicle is 4.25 feet above the roadway surface, as illustrated in Figure 6-3. At
        the decision point, the driver's eye height is used for the measurement. Sometimes a higher
        driver's eye height should be considered for drivers of trucks to see underneath the tree canopy.
                         Figure 6-3 Heights Pertaining to Sight Triangles




                                              (Source: CTRE)

TRAFFIC STUDIES MANUAL                            Page 36                                    March 9, 2011
(2)   Any object within the sight triangle that would obstruct the driver's view of an approaching
      vehicle (4.25 feet in height) should be removed or modified or appropriate traffic control devices
      should be installed as per the MUTCD. Obstructions within sight triangles could be buildings,
      parked vehicles, hedges, trees, bushes, tall crops, walls, fences, etc. Figure 6-4 shows a clear
      sight triangle and an obstructed sight triangle.

                                            (Source: CTRE)

6.3   SIGHT DISTANCE STUDY METHODS
(1)   Different types of traffic control require different sight distances. For example, intersections with
      no control require adequate distance for the approaching vehicle to identify any conflicts in or
      approaching the intersection before entering. An approach sight triangle is used for this analysis.
      However, intersections with stop control require drivers to stop at the intersection, check for
      approaching vehicles in the intersection, and then depart. A departure sight triangle is used for
      this analysis.
(2)   Example sighting and target rods are illustrated in Figure 6-5. The target rod can be constructed
      out of normal 1x2 dimensional lumber. The target rod should be 4.25 feet tall to represent the
      vehicle height and be painted fluorescent orange on both the top portion and bottom 2 feet of the
      rod. The bottom 2-foot portion represents the object height for measuring stopping sight distance
      (this will be further explained later in Section 6.3.3). The sighting rod should be 3.5 feet tall to
      represent the driver's eye height. The sighting rod can be constructed out of the same type of
      wood but should be painted flat black. The sighting rod and target rod are used in measuring
      sight distance.
(3)   The methods to measure and analyze the approach sight distance for uncontrolled intersection,
      intersection sight distance for STOP controlled intersections and stopping sight distance are
      described below.

6.3.1 UNCONTROLLED INTERSECTIONS
(1)   For uncontrolled intersections, the drivers of both approaching vehicles should be able to see
      conflicting vehicles in adequate time to stop or slow to avoid a crash. The required sight distance
      for safe operation at an uncontrolled intersection is directly related to the vehicle speeds and the
      distances traveled during perception, reaction, and braking time. Table 6-1 lists the minimum
      recommended sight distances for specific design speeds. For example, for a speed limit of 30
      mph, 140 feet is the minimum recommended sight distance along that approach leg.

(2)   Determine the minimum sight distance for the posted speed on each approach to the intersection
      per Table 6-1.
(3)   Sight distance measurements should be gathered for all legs of the uncontrolled intersection.
      Traffic approaching from both the left and right should be considered for measurements. The
      observer records the date and time, posted or operating speed, site location, and weather
      conditions on the sight distance diagram. The measuring process is represented in Figure 6-6 and
      described below.
            Figure 6-6 Sight Distance Measurement at Uncontrolled Intersection




                                             (Source: CTRE)
(4)   The observer holds the sighting rod, and the assistant holds the target rod. They position
      themselves on two intersecting approaches at the appropriate stopping sight distances taken from
      Table 6-1. These are the X and Y dimensions. The observer represents the approaching vehicle
      and is located at the decision point. The observer uses the 3.5-foot sighting rod, which represents
      the driver's eye height. The assistant represents the intersecting vehicle. The assistant uses the
      4.25-foot target rod, which represents the height of the approaching vehicle. The observer sights
      from the top of the sighting rod to the target rod.
(5)   If the target rod is visible, the approach sight triangle for the intersection is appropriate. If the top
      of the target rod is not visible, the assistant holding the target rod should walk toward the
      intersection along the centerline of the intersecting lane until the observer can see the target rod.
      When the target rod is visible, the position should be marked and the distance to the intersection
      should be measured along the centerline of the roadway. This is the X dimension.
(6)   The analysis of intersection sight distance consists of comparing the recommended sight distance
      to the measured sight distance. The measured sight distance should be equal to or greater than the
      recommended stopping sight distance. If the measured sight distance is less than the
      recommended sight distance, some mitigation may be required. Some mitigation measures are as
      follows:
      (a)     Remove/modify obstruction.
      (b)     Reduce speeds (Note: posting lower speed limits alone is seldom effective).
      (c)     Install traffic control devices (if warranted by the MUTCD).

6.3.2 INTERSECTIONS CONTROLLED WITH STOP SIGNS
(1)   Vehicles stopped at an intersection must have sufficient sight distance to permit a safe departure.
      At intersections with stop sign control, close attention should be given to departure sight
      triangles.
(2)   Three maneuvers can be completed by vehicles stopped at an intersection: crossing maneuver,
      left-turn maneuver, and right-turn maneuver.
(3)   When a driver is completing a crossing maneuver, there must be sufficient sight distance in both
      directions available to cross the intersecting roadway and avoid approaching traffic. The sight
      distance required for this maneuver is based on the distance approaching vehicles will travel on
      the major road during the time it takes a stopped vehicle to clear the intersection. Table 6-2 lists
      the recommended sight distances for this maneuver based on design speeds.
(4)   The left-turn maneuver requires first clearing the traffic on the left, then entering the traffic
      stream from the right. The required sight distance for this maneuver is affected by the amount of
      time it takes the stopped vehicle to turn left, clearing traffic from the left and reach average
      running speed without affecting the speed of an approaching vehicle from the right. Table 6-2
      lists the recommended sight distances for this maneuver based on design speeds.
(5)   The right turn maneuver must have sufficient sight distance to permit entrance onto the
      intersecting roadway and then accelerate to the posted speed limit without being overtaken by
      approaching vehicles from the left. Table 6-2 lists the recommended sight distances for this
      maneuver based on design speeds.

(6)   To measure the intersection sight distance, first determine the minimum sight distance for each
      maneuver and speed (see Table 6-2).
(7)   The observer records the date and time, posted or operating speed, site location, and weather
      conditions on the sight distance diagram.
(8)   The sight distance should be measured in each direction from each minor street approach. The
      line of sight should be from the driver's eye position where traffic would normally be expected to
      stop and look for gaps in approaching traffic (a typical rule of thumb is 15 feet from the near edge

       of the major street traveled way). Observation of traffic behavior at the intersection should be
       used to determine the point at which the majority of drivers stop to look for gaps in traffic without
       encroaching on the through lanes. Measure the intersection sight distance from that point.
(9)    The observer with the sighting rod stands at the center of the approaching lane at the point
       determined above. The observer's eyes should be at the top of the sighting rod. The assistant
       walks away from the observer along the intersecting roadway toward approaching traffic. The
       assistant should stop periodically and place the target rod on the pavement for sighting by the
       observer. This process should continue until the top of the target rod can no longer be seen. The
       point where the target rod disappears is the maximum sight distance along that leg. The position
       should be marked and the distance to the intersection should be measured along the centerline of
       the roadway.
(10)   The analysis of intersection sight distance consists of comparing the recommended sight distance
       to the measured available sight distance. The comparison of the actual distances should be
       performed with consideration to posted speed limit. If the measured sight distance is less than the
       recommended sight distance some mitigation may be required. Some mitigation measures are as
       follows:
       (a)     Remove/modify obstruction.
       (b)     Post a reduced advisory speed.
       (c)     Install additional traffic control devices (if warranted by the MUTCD).
6.3.3 STOPPING SIGHT DISTANCE
(1)    The available sight distance on a roadway should be sufficiently long to enable a vehicle traveling
       at the posted speed to stop before reaching a stationary object in its path. Although greater
       lengths of visible roadway are desirable, the sight distance at every point along a roadway should
       be at least that needed for a below-average driver or vehicle to stop (AASHTO Green Book).
       Stopping sight distance is defined as the sum of two distances:
       (a)     Brake reaction distance ­ the distance traveled by the vehicle from the instant the driver
               sees an object necessitating a stop to the instant the brakes are applied; plus
       (b)     Braking distance ­ the distance needed to stop the vehicle from the instant brake
               application begins.
(2)    The reaction distance is based on the reaction time of the driver and the speed of the vehicle. The
       braking distance is dependent upon the vehicle speed and the coefficient of friction between the
       tires and roadway.
(3)    Table 6-3 lists minimum recommended stopping sight distances based on design speed and the
       sum of reaction distance and braking distance rounded to the nearest 5 feet for ease of
       application. At 55 mph, for example, the recommended stopping sight distance is 495 feet.
(4)    For stopping distance calculations, the height of the driver's eye is 3.5 feet above the roadway
       and the object height is 2 feet above the roadway surface, as illustrated in Figure 6-7. The 2-foot
       object height represents an object that the driver of an approaching vehicle would want to avoid.
(5)    One element to consider for stopping sight distance is vertical curvature of the roadway. On
       straight roadway sections, the obstruction that blocks the driver's vision of the roadway ahead is
       the vertical curvature of the road surface. As the vertical curvature increases, stopping sight
       distance also increases.
(6)    Determine the minimum stopping sight distance for the posted speed limit (see Table 6-3).
(7)    The observer records the date and time, posted or operating speed, site location, and weather
       conditions on the sight distance diagram.

(8)   Standing at a pre-determined location along the road, the observer should sight from the top of
      the sighting road while the assistant moves away in the direction of travel. The assistant stops
      when the bottom 2-foot portion of the target rod is no longer visible. This is the distance at which
      a 2-foot tall object can no longer be seen by an approaching driver. The distance from the
      disappearing point to the observer is measured and recorded.

(9)   The analysis of stopping sight distance consists of comparing the recommended sight distance to
      the measured sight distance. The measured stopping sight distance should be greater than the
      recommended stopping distance. On a horizontal curved roadway, a sight obstruction may be due
      to the curve or to physical features outside of the roadway. On a straight roadway, the sight
      obstruction will be due to the vertical curvature of the roadway.

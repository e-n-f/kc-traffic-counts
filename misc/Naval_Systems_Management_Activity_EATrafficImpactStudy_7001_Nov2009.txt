1.0   PROJECT OVERVIEW

This traffic impact study was prepared to support the Environmental
Assessment (EA) for the Relocation of the Navy Systems Management
Activity (NSMA) to Naval Support Facility (NSF) Anacostia, Washington,
DC. Figure 1 shows the location of NSF Anacostia.

The study's purpose is to evaluate the impacts on local traffic that
would result from the proposed relocation of 800 NSMA employees from
their current, multiple workplaces in Arlington County, Virginia, to
one consolidated facility on NSF Anacostia, at a site northwest of the
intersection of Brookley Avenue and Thomas Road (Preferred Site, see
Figure 2). The proposed relocation is in compliance with the 2005 Base
Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Act of 2005, which mandates the closure
of several leased Navy installations in the National Capital Region
and the relocation of the organizations occupying these installations
to Department of Defense (DoD)-owned space in the National Capital
Region.

The study also considers the impacts of relocating the 800 NSMA
employees to a similar facility built at an alternative location
(shown on Figure 2). This alternative site is part of the Bellevue
Housing development south of NSF Anacostia and Bolling Air Force Base
(AFB).

The relocation of NSMA to its new facility is scheduled to be
completed by September 2011. Therefore, 2011 is the target year for
this study.

2.0   PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

2.1. Project Location

NSF Anacostia is located in the southwestern quadrant of the District
of Columbia, along the eastern shore of the Anacostia River, near the
river's confluence with the Potomac. The installation is across the
Potomac from Arlington County, where existing NSMA facilities are
located (See Figure 2).

In compliance with the 2005 BRAC Act, NSF Anacostia is in the process
of becoming a joint base with Bolling AFB, home to the US Air Force's
11th Wing, located immediately to the south of NSF Anacostia. The
Anacostia-Bolling joint base will be managed by the Navy. NSF
Anacostia and Bolling AFB, although historically administratively
distinct, are physically continuous and share a perimeter fence and
entry gates (North, Main [or Arnold], and South gates, shown on Figure
2). Together, they occupy 958 acres (351 acres for NSF Anacostia and
607 acres for Bolling AFB) bounded by the Anacostia River and the
Potomac River to the west, South Capitol Street and Interstate Highway
295 (I-295) to the east, Poplar Point and the Frederick Douglass

Memorial Bridge to the north, and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)
and Bellevue Housing to the south. Part of Bellevue (including the
alternative site) is included within the Bolling-Anacostia boundary.

2.2   Site Plan

A layout of the proposed combined facility at the preferred site is
shown in Figures 3 and 4. The facility will include 46 parking spaces.
Nearby existing parking lots and garages (all located on the
installation) will provide additional parking for employees.

2.3   Existing Land Use

Area Land Use

The Bolling-Anacostia installation occupies part of a long and
relatively narrow strip of land extending between the Potomac and
Anacostia rivers to the north and west, and South Capitol Street,
Overlook Avenue, and I-295 to the east and south. In addition to the
installation, this stretch of waterside land contains other large
institutional compounds such as NRL and, farther south, the District
of Columbia's Blue Plains wastewater treatment plant. Large tracts of
military family housing (Air Force Housing on Bolling AFB and the
Navy's Bellevue Housing) are also present.

The area east of I-295 is predominantly in residential use (Barry Farm
and Congress Heights neighborhoods), though a large institutional
compound ­ the 173-acre St. Elizabeth's West Campus, currently being
prepared for use by the US Department of Homeland Security ­ is also
present, overlooking NSF Anacostia from across the interstate. To the
north of NSF Anacostia, the shore of the Anacostia River is occupied
by parkland (Poplar Point, Anacostia Park).

Across the Anacostia River and west of South Capitol Street, land use
consists primarily of low-density commercial and industrial areas with
some residential developments. The area east of South Capitol Street
is in a transitional stage. Formerly characterized by warehouses,
nightclubs,   and  industrial   uses,   it   has  undergone  extensive
redevelopment centered on such large-scale projects as the Washington
Nationals Major League Ballpark, between N Street and Potomac Avenue
SE; the US Department of Transportation on M Street; and numerous new
office and residential buildings and developments along M Street and
New Jersey Avenue. Redevelopment of the Southeast Federal Center, on M
Street, into a new mixed-used neighborhood, has also begun.

Project Site Land Use

The preferred site is currently mostly vacant. Its northern half was
previously occupied by Building 150, an administrative facility now
demolished (see Figure 4). The southern half of the site is occupied

by a parking lot and several trailers that will be relocated to make
room for the new facility. Nearest Thomas Road, Building 387, a semi-
permanent facility, will be relocated as well. The alternative site is
vacant and undeveloped.

2.4   Proposed Land Use

The proposed action will change the land use of the project site by
building a new facility that will comprise (1) an administrative
building with approximately 160,000 gross square feet of space and a
footprint of approximately 32,000 square feet and (2) a warehouse
approximately 23,000 square feet in size (see Figure 3).         The
warehouse will have three loading docks; on average, no more than
three tractor trailers a day will access or leave the facility,
although they will not do so every day. Smaller delivery trucks will
also access the facility on a daily basis.

2.5   Phasing and Timing

The facility is planned to be operational with                all   personnel,
equipment, and program moved in by September 2011.

2.6   Study Area

The study area for this project is bounded by the Anacostia River on
the north, I-295 on the east, the NRL campus on the south, and the
Potomac River on the west. Figure 5 shows the six intersections that
are being evaluated in this study.

2.7   Planned Roadway Improvements

Several transportation improvement projects          are    planned   in   the
vicinity of the study area, including:

  ·   Realignment of the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge and new
      signalized traffic circle at South Capitol Street and Suitland
      Parkway (2012).

  ·   Reconstruction of the 11th Street bridges with a new full
      interchange with the Anacostia Freeway to separate local and
      interstate traffic via two bridges (2013).

  ·   Construction of a     new   urban   diamond   I-295/Suitland     Parkway
      Interchange (2015).

  ·   Reconstruction of the Malcolm X Avenue/I-295 interchange to
      connect to a new road that will extend between Firth Sterling
      Avenue and Malcolm X Avenue and provide access to the West Campus
      of St. Elizabeth's Hospital (2016).

NSMA Relocation
Traffic Impact Study



The 11th Street bridges project, the South Capitol Street project,   and
the I-295/Suitland Interchange modification are included in          the
Anacostia Waterfront Initiative Transportation Master Plan and       are
programmed in the Constrained Long Range Plan (CLRP) and             the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).

The listed roadway improvements have not been included in the
evaluation of no-action conditions presented here because none are
expected to be completed by 2011, the horizon year for this study.

2.8    Planned Development Projects

Similarly, no planned and approved development projects within or near
the study area are expected to have an impact on traffic conditions by
2011. No significant net change to the installation's personnel
loadings (both Bolling and Anacostia) is expected by 2011. In the
installation's vicinity, the relocation of the Department of Homeland
Security to the West Campus of St. Elizabeth's Hospital is scheduled
for 2016; the completion of the Barry Farm renovation project is
expected by 2018; no definitive plans or schedule are currently
available for the redevelopment of Poplar Point, which, for this
reason, is not included in the latest MWCOG population projections.

3.0    EXISTING CONDITIONS

3.1    Roadway Inventory

The roadways within the study area that are expected to be directly
impacted by the proposed action are discussed in this section. Figure
6 shows the roadway classification for the area's network.

   ·   The I-295 section of the Anacostia Freeway is classified as an
       interstate highway. It branches off the Southeast-Southwest
       Freeway in Northeast DC, crosses the Anacostia River on the 11th
       Street Bridge, then runs southward to the Capital Beltway (I-495)
       near the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in Prince Georges County,
       Maryland. To the northeast, the I-295 section of the Anacostia
       Freeway connects with the DC 295 section of the Anacostia
       Freeway/Kenilworth Avenue corridor, providing access to the
       Baltimore Washington Parkway and US 50. Within the study area, I-
       295 runs in a north-south direction. Northbound I-295 provides
       access to Bolling AFB's main gate via Malcolm X Avenue. The speed
       limit is 50 miles per hour (MPH). Annual Daily Traffic (ADT) is
       85,000 vehicles.

   ·   South Capitol Street is classified as an expressway south of M
       Street and along the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge over the
       Anacostia River, past which it continues south, parallel to I-
       295. The classification of the roadway changes from expressway to
       minor arterial south of its intersection with Firth Sterling

3.2     Existing Traffic Volumes

To determine existing traffic operations in the study area, manual
traffic turning movement counts were taken on Tuesday March 17 and
Wednesday March 18, 2009, during the AM (6:30-8:30) and PM (3:30-5:30)
peak periods at the following six intersections (see Figure 5):

   1.   South Capitol St. (Southbound) and Malcolm X Ave. (signalized)
   2.   South Capitol St. (Northbound) and Malcolm X Ave. (signalized)
   3.   I-295 off ramp at Malcolm X Ave. SE (un-signalized)
   4.   South Capitol St. at Firth Sterling Ave. (signalized)
   5.   Overlook Ave. SW at South Gate (signalized)
   6.   Overlook Ave SW at Chesapeake St SW (signalized)

The field data sheets for each intersection and peak period are
provided in Attachment A. A determination of the AM and PM peak hours
was made based on these peak-period counts. Turning movement counts
were analyzed to determine the four highest consecutive 15-minute
volumes (the peak hour) during each peak period. The peak hours were
determined to be:

   ·    AM Peak Hour: 7:00-8:00 AM
   ·    PM Peak Hour: 4:15-5:15 PM

ADT volumes for roadway links were derived from        DC Department of
Transportation (DDOT) 2007 traffic volumes adjusted    for 2009 using an
annual growth rate of +2%. The ADT of a roadway is     the typical daily
traffic volume in both directions. The 2007 DDOT ADT   volumes are shown
in Figure 7.

  Figure 7.     DDOT Traffic Volume Map (2007)




Threshold capacity for link ADT volumes is based upon the following
DDOT guidelines:

Facility Type                    Lanes     Threshold Capacity in ADT
Minor Collector                  2         10,000
Major Collector/Minor Arterial   4         20,000
Major Arterial                   4         30,000

3.3   Traffic Capacity Analysis

Using the existing traffic volumes as determined by the counts, the
six study intersections were analyzed using the procedures set forth
in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Transportation Research Board,
Updated 2000. The Highway Capacity Software (HCS) program was used to
determine traffic operational levels of service (LOS). Existing
traffic signal timings were used for all analyses.

LOS is a measurement of traffic flow in terms of speed and travel
time, freedom to maneuver, comfort, and convenience.  There are six
LOS, designated by the letters A through F, with LOS A representing
the best operating conditions and LOS F the worst. LOS for
intersections are measured in terms of vehicle delay, with somewhat
different values for signalized intersections and un-signalized
intersections, as shown in Table 1.

                                        Table 1
               LOS Values for Signalized and Un-signalized Intersections

          Signalized Intersections                       Un-signalized Intersections
Level of Service (LOS)       Vehicle Delay        Level of Service (LOS)   Vehicle Delay
                             (Seconds)                                     (Seconds)

      A                    Less than 10                 A                   Less than 10
      B                    >10-20                       B                   >10-15
      C                    >20-35                       C                   >15-25
      D                    >35-55                       D                   >25-35
      E                    >55-80                       E                   >35-50
      F                    More than 80                 F                   More than 50


The LOS for signalized intersections can reflect the average delay for
the entire intersection and the delay for individual movements. For
un-signalized intersections, the LOS reflects the delay for side
street traffic attempting to enter the mainline. All intersections in
this analysis are signalized, except Intersection #3 (I-295 off ramp
at Malcolm X Ave SE). Additional results provided by the analysis are
delay per vehicle in seconds, and volume/capacity (v/c) ratios.    The
v/c ratio is a comparison between the volume of traffic entering the
intersection from one or all approaches and the possible capacity of
one or all approaches.

An LOS C or better is the desirable goal for a roadway facility.
However, in major urban areas such as Washington, DC, LOS D is
considered acceptable. LOS E and F are considered to be at or below
capacity and are generally unacceptable. A summary of existing LOS for
the 6 study intersections, including delays and v/c ratios, is shown
in Table 2.     The analysis of existing conditions shows that all
intersections in the study area operate at overall LOS C or better.

3.4       Public Transportation

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA or Metro)
provides access to NSF Anacostia and Bolling AFB via several Metrobus
routes and one Metrorail station. The Air Force runs a shuttle service
between the Metro station and the Bolling-Anacostia installation.

Metrorail
The nearest Metrorail station is the Anacostia Station, near the
intersection of Firth Sterling Avenue and Howard Road, SE, a little
more than half a mile from NSF Anacostia's North Gate. Anacostia-
Bolling employees commuting by Metro have to walk to the installation
via Firth Sterling Avenue. However, there is no continuous pedestrian
route with sidewalks along this stretch of Firth Sterling Avenue. Past
the intersection with the Suitland Parkway, pedestrians must walk on
the side of the road or on grass. On their way to the installation,
pedestrians must cross the Suitland Parkway and South Capitol Street.
There is no crosswalk across South Capitol Street. There is a
crosswalk across the Suitland Parkway, but according to DDOT Traffic
Services   Administration,  this   is  a   high  pedestrian   accident
intersection. Finally, the reputation of the surrounding neighborhood



                                                             11

as a high-crime area further discourages potential pedestrians.
Existing shuttle services partly mitigate this situation (see below).

Metrobus
Seven Metrobus lines run along South Capitol Street, with stops near
Bolling and Anacostia. Information on these lines is summarized in
Table 3.

Only Line W-4 provides service throughout the day. Line W-4 serves the
Main Gate at South Capitol Street and Malcolm X Avenue, and the North
Gate at South Capitol Street and Firth Sterling Avenue. So does Line
A-9, but on a much more limited schedule since, like the other lines,
it only provides rush-hour service. With the exception of Line W-4,
the bus lines that run along South Capitol Street near the project
site are primarily designed to move people between downtown Washington
and the Maryland suburbs during peak periods. The project site is
approximately 1,700 feet from the North Gate; as previously noted,

there is no crosswalk across South Capitol at the North Gate. Along
with the limited schedules, these factors are likely to discourage
potential bus riders.

Shuttle Services
Existing shuttle service between the Anacostia Station and NSF
Anacostia via the North Gate includes a shuttle run by the Air Force
between 5:25 and 9:15 in the morning and 3:10 and 6:48 in the evening,
with 20-minute headways. The shuttle stops at several places on NSF
Anacostia and Bolling AFB. The closest stop to the preferred site is
Stop #4, near the intersection of Thomas Road and Brookley Boulevard.
The ride between the Metrorail station and Stop #4 takes between 20
and 30 minutes, depending on the direction. The shuttle does not stop
within walking distance of the alternative site. The appeal of this
shuttle service is diminished by the lack of mid-day service, which
may leave employees stranded. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
runs another shuttle, but it is limited to DIA employees. Both
shuttles operate under waivers from DoD transportation regulations
that prohibit use of government-run transportation between residences
and workplaces. A shuttle map and schedule are included in attachment
D.

4.0   NO ACTION CONDITIONS (2011)

4.1   Affected Roadway Network

Under No Action conditions, the proposed relocation of NSMA would      not
occur, with no impacts on the road network near NSF Anacostia          and
Bolling AFB. Analysis of the No Action Alternative provides            the
baseline for evaluating the impacts of the action alternatives.        The
year of analysis is 2011, which is when the new NSMA facility           is
scheduled to be fully occupied.

4.2   Planned Roadway Improvements and Approved Development Projects

No planned roadway improvements in the vicinity of the project area
have been included in the analysis because all known planned and
approved projects have completion dates later than 2011.

4.3   Traffic Capacity Analysis

To estimate 2011 no action peak hour LOS, a two-percent-per-year
growth rate was assumed and added to the 2009 traffic volumes. A
summary of the LOS analysis results, including delays and v/c ratios,
is shown in Table 4. The analysis shows that all intersections in the
study area are projected to operate at LOS C or better, with the
exception of Intersection #4 (South Capitol St. at Firth Sterling
Ave.), which would operate at LOS D (from C under existing conditions)
during the PM peak hour.

5.0       ANACOSTIA ALTERNATIVE CONDITIONS (2011)

5.1       Trip Generation

The number of vehicle trips generated by NSMA was determined based on
the number of employees expected to drive to and from work during the
AM and PM peak hours. Under the proposed action, a total of 800
employees would relocate to NSF Anacostia. The expected modal split
(percentage of employees using different modes of transportation) was
determined based on modal split information provided in the December
2004 Anacostia Annex Site Development Plan (Section 3.6). The number
of vehicle trips to the site on a typical workday was calculated based
on the modal split. Results are shown in Table 5.

2. Based on an average of 2.5 passengers in each car pool and 5 passengers in each van
pool.


A total of 645 vehicle trips is expected to be generated by the site
every AM and PM. Hourly arrival rates and departure rates of employees
were determined by analyzing gate traffic counts conducted on November
18, 2008. Based on these counts, 44% of the trips (284 vehicles) are
expected to arrive during the AM peak hour and 42% (271 vehicles)
would depart during the PM peak hour. The percentage of vehicle
entering or exiting each gate during the peak hours was also
calculated   based  on  the   November  18   counts.  The   number  of
visitors/deliveries during the AM and PM peak hours was assumed to be
14 vehicles.

5.2     Traffic Distribution

The distribution of the project-generated vehicular traffic on the
roadways providing access to and from the proposed project site is a
key element in determining traffic impacts on the surrounding
intersections.

For this analysis, the following residential location data were
provided by the Navy: 70% of the existing NSMA employees reside in
Virginia, 29% in Maryland and 1% in another jurisdiction, assumed to
be Washington DC for the purposes of this analysis. However,
distributing vehicle trips over the road network requires finer-
grained data (generally, employees' residential zip codes), which were
not made available for this study. Therefore, reasonable assumptions
had to be made with regard to the residential location of NSMA
employees. To this end, the residential distribution of DoD employees
relocating from Arlington County to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, as
presented in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for BRAC
Implementation and Related Army Actions (June 2007), was used as a
stand-in (with minor adjustments) for the residential distribution of
NSMA employees, also DoD employees located in Arlington County.

On this basis, it was estimated that 40% of the NSMA employees would
enter the study area from southbound South Capitol Street, 32% would
enter from southbound I-295, 26% from northbound I-295, and 2% from



                                         15

Traffic Impact Study



westbound Suitland Parkway. Distributing these traffic volumes on the
local network, 62% of the traffic is expected to use the North Gate;
26% is expected use the Main Gate; and 12% is expected to use the
South Gate. The assignment of project-generated peak hour traffic was
based upon these assumed traffic distribution percentages.

5.3   Peak Hour Trip Generation

Trips occurring during peak hours as a result of the project are shown
in Table 6. Approximately 241 vehicles would enter and 57 vehicles
would exit the site during the AM peak hour. During the PM peak hour,
approximately 49 vehicles would enter and 236 vehicles would exit the
site.

5.4   Traffic Capacity Analysis

Using estimated 2011 traffic volumes, the six study intersections were
analyzed using the HCS program to determine LOS for future conditions
under the Anacostia Alternative. Existing traffic signal timings were
used to allow for a direct comparison with the no action and the
existing   condition   scenarios.   However,  future   signal   timing
modifications might improve delays. Table 7 shows the projected 2011
LOS under the Anacostia Alternative. The analysis shows that, under
this alternative, LOS would be very similar to existing and no action
LOS, with slightly increased delays. All study intersections would
operate at an overall LOS C or better, with the exception of
Intersection #4 (South Capitol St. at Firth Sterling Ave.), which
would operate at LOS D during the PM peak period, as it would under no
action conditions.

6.0       BELLEVUE ALTERNATIVE CONDITIONS (2011)

6.1       Trip Generation

The number of vehicle trips generated by NSMA is the same under this
alternative as it would be under the Anacostia Alternative.

6.2       Traffic Distribution

The distribution of the generated vehicular traffic on the roadways
providing access to the Bolling-Anacostia installation would change
under this alternative.

Using the same methodology as was used for the Anacostia Alternative
conditions analysis, it was estimated that 86% of the NSMA employees
would enter the study area via northbound I-295, 9% would enter it via
southbound I-295, and 5% would enter it via South Capitol Street.
Distributing these traffic volumes on the local network, 75% of the
traffic is projected to use the South Gate; 20% is expected to use the
Main Gate; and 5% is expected to use the North Gate. The assignment of
project-generated peak hour traffic was based on these projected
traffic distribution percentages.

6.3   Peak Hour Trip Generation

Trips projected to occur during the AM and PM peak hours under the
Bellevue Alternative are shown in Table 8. The total traffic would
remain the same as under the Anacostia Alternative, but the gate
volumes and the local network traffic volumes would change.

6.4   Traffic Capacity Analysis

Using the estimated 2011 traffic volumes, the six study intersections
were analyzed to determine LOS under the Bellevue alternative. Table 9
shows the results of the analysis. LOS under the Bellevue Alternative
would be very similar to those under the Anacostia Alternative. All
study intersections would operate at overall LOS C or better, with the
exception of Intersection #4 (South Capitol St. at Firth Sterling
Ave.), which would operate at LOS D during the PM peak period, as it
would under no action conditions.

7.0   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1   Traffic Impacts

Based on the analyses summarized above, the relocation of NSMA under
either of the alternatives considered is not expected to significantly
degrade intersection LOS in the study area. Intersection delays and
v/c ratios would increase marginally. The intersection of South
Capitol Street and Firth Sterling Avenue would continue to operate at
LOS D during the PM peak hour, as it is expected to do under no action
conditions. LOS D is acceptable in major urban areas such as
Washington, DC. All the other study intersections would experience
small increases in traffic volumes, but they would continue to operate
at LOS C or better. Therefore, the proposed action is not expected to
have a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions in the study
area.

7.2       Recommendations

The roadways and intersections of the study area would continue to
operate under capacity after the proposed relocation of NSMA has taken
place. No roadway improvements or other mitigation measures are
recommended.

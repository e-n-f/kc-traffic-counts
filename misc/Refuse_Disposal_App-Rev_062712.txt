The FCCRWTE site will be located on an 11-acre parcel in the McKinney Industrial Park
in Frederick County, Maryland, near the intersection of English Muffin Way and
Buckeystown Pike (Maryland Route 85). The site is currently vacant and bordered by
railroad tracks on the west side, the Frederick County Ballenger-McKinney Wastewater
Treatment Plant (BMWWTP) on the north side, the Monocacy River on the east side, and
the Frederick County Division of Utilities and Solid Waste Management (DUSWM) of-
fice building on the south side. Figure 1-1 depicts the Facility location and topography.
Figures 1-2 and 1-3 depict the land use and zoning designations, respectively, for the lo-
cation of FCCRWTE and surrounding areas within 0.25 mile. Furthermore, Figures 1-2
and 1-4 clearly depict that there are no public/private elementary or secondary schools
within 1 mile of the FCCRWTE site.

2.1        SERVICE AREAS
FCCRWTE has been sized to meet the needs of all residential, business, industrial, insti-
tutional, and commercial waste generators of Frederick and Carroll Counties, Maryland,
and is sized to accommodate long-term growth in the Counties. Additional waste from
outside the primary service area will be accepted early in the life of the project at the dis-
cretion of the Counties to enable FCCRWTE to generate the maximum amount of renew-
able energy.


2.2        MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE QUANTITIES AND PROJECTIONS
Population growth is an important part of waste management planning, because it pro-
vides a base to estimate the amount of waste that will be produced. Both Frederick and
Carroll Counties are currently experiencing a growth in their populations. Typically, as
the population increases, so does the amount of waste generated, even if the per capita
waste generation rate plateaus and does not increase.


With the full implementation of the residential single-stream recycling program, in addi-
tion to planned policies and programs, both Counties anticipate the amount of waste ma-
terials separated for recycling to increase, along with the population and amount of mu-
nicipal wastes generated. Appendix A provides the draft final materials separation plan,
which provides solid waste quantities and projections for both Counties.


2.3        WASTE DESCRIPTION
FCCRWTE will combust processible waste, sewage sludge, and scrap tires. Known quan-
tities of nonprocessible solid waste will not be accepted at FCCRWTE. Processible and
nonprocessible solid wastes are described in Subsections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, respectively.


2.3.1          PROCESSIBLE SOLID WASTE
FCCRWTE is designed to combust a nominal 1,500 tpd at 5,500 British thermal units
(Btu) per pound (higher heating value [HHV]) of processible solid waste. Actual quanti-
ties of processible solid waste combusted will vary. In general, as the Btu content (HHV)

of the solid waste mixture increases, the solid waste quantity combusted decreases. Con-
versely, in general, as the Btu content (HHV) of the solid waste mixture decreases, the
solid waste quantity combusted increases. This relationship is subject to system limita-
tions. Daily quantities of processible solid waste combusted will vary based on the Btu
content of the solid waste combusted on that day. The maximum quantity of solid waste
that could be combusted annually would be 602,250 tons.


Acceptable and processible solid waste will include municipal solid waste (MSW) con-
sisting of materials and substances discarded or rejected as being spent, useless, worth-
less, or in excess to the owners at the time of such discard or rejection, including, without
limitation, waste, garbage, trash, rubbish, and refuse that is normally disposed of by, and
collected from, residential, commercial, industrial, governmental, or institutional estab-
lishments. Acceptable solid waste will be composed of waste materials or debris that can
be combusted, having a composition with characteristics such as that collected and dis-
posed of as part of normal collections of waste materials and debris in Frederick and Car-
roll Counties as well as other areas (as approved by NEA) outside the primary service
areas, Acceptable and processible solid waste will include but not be limited to:
                        Sewage sludge as defined in Section 2.3.3.
                        Garbage, rubbish, trash, and refuse.

and will be spaced out so as not to overload the sewage sludge pit. Frederick and Carroll
Counties will make arrangements for temporary storage or alternate disposal of the sew-
age sludge during Facility outages.


2.3.4          SCRAP TIRES
Scrap tires will be combusted to offset the effects of sludge combustion on the HHV of
the overall solid waste mixture. Up to a maximum of 20,000 tons per year of scrap tires
may be combusted in FCCRWTE. The scrap tires will be delivered by truck and unload-
ed on the tipping floor. The scrap tires will then be pushed by the loader into the solid
waste storage pit and dispersed throughout the solid waste in the pit by the grapple opera-
tor to create a well-mixed solid waste supply for the furnace. Steam generation will be
monitored by the crane and plant operators, who will adjust operating conditions as re-
quired. Incidental scrap tires may also be combusted as part of the routine MSW delivery
process.


Scrap tire delivery will be weighed to allow for proper recording of tons of scrap tires
processed. Continuous measurement of the weight of the scrap tires (or any other element
in the solid waste mix) as fed into the hoppers is not necessary.

Figure 3-1 shows the general Facility layout, including building/structures, traffic flow,
and the waste delivery/unloading area; Figure 3-2 illustrates the site grading and drain-
age, including environmental site design areas and the wet pond for stormwater detention.
Figures 3-3, 3-3A, and 3-3B provides a multiple view rendering of the site, the east and
west building elevations, and north and south building elevations, respectively.


Figure 3-4 depicts the primary buildings/structures and their dimensions. The tipping bay
building, solid waste storage pit, sewage sludge building, warehouse/maintenance build-
ing, and administration building will be designed as an integral structure. The primary
structural system will be structural steel columns, beams, and bracing for the main load
resisting system. Roofs for the other structures will be sloped slightly to drain to a low
point, where the water will be discharged through drains to the site stormwater drainage
system.


The tipping bay and the sewage sludge building and solid waste storage pit areas will be a
totally enclosed structures. Odor control in the tipping bay building, sewage sludge build-
ing, and solid waste storage pit areas will be achieved by maintaining these areas under
negative pressure using the combustor/boilers' primary air system. Water stops will be
provided at construction joints to prevent migration of groundwater into the pit and out-
ward flow of possible leachate or liquids from the bottom of the pit.


The boiler building, turbine generator building, and air quality control system (AQCS)
building will be designed as an integral structure. The primary structural system will be
structural steel columns, beams, and bracing for the main load resisting system. Air pollu-
tion control equipment will be located inside the AQCS building. Roofs for the boiler
building will be sloped slightly to drain to a low point, from where the water will be dis-
charged through drains to the site drainage system.


The primary structural system for the ash and metal recovery building will also be struc-
tural steel columns, beams, and bracing for the main load resisting system. The roof will

through drains to the site drainage system.


The stack will be self-supporting steel with a reinforced concrete enclosure extending
roughly half the height of the stack. There will be several tanks and/or silos at the site.
These will include the service water tank, demineralized water tank, lime silos, sorbent
silo, aqueous ammonia tank, fuel tank, and wastewater tank. These tanks and silos will be
placed on reinforced concrete foundations. The lime silos and carbon-based sorbent silo
will be located inside the AQCS building.


The water treatment building will be a preengineered or prefabricated building. The fly
ash surge bin enclosure will be constructed of structural steel columns, beams, and brac-
ing for the main load resisting system. Their roofs will be sloped slightly to drain to a low
point, from where the water will be discharged through drains to the site drainage system.


A screen wall will be provided in the parking area outside the administration building to
visually shield the equipment and process areas. This wall will be constructed of structur-
al steel columns, beams, and bracing for the main load resisting system. Metal siding will
be installed on girts connected to the columns.

                                         4.0 PROCESS SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION


FCCRWTE will employ state-of-the-art technology and operating principles including
the most recent advances in combustion facility design, heat recovery, and air emissions
control equipment. WTI's design includes:
                        High availability vertical convection pass boilers that are highly reliable and
                        cost-effective to operate and maintain.
                        A high-pressure (HP) steam cycle that maximizes efficiency and electric
                        power production.
                        A water-cooled combustion grate.
                        Flow-optimized swirl injection of secondary air in the combustor/boilers.
                        Flue gas recirculation.
                        Sewage sludge process and handling, including all necessary odor control
                        equipment.


The following subsections provide an overview of the materials flow and handling at
FCCRWTE. They also identify each major equipment component and describe the
movement of materials within FCCRWTE, from point of receipt through waste combus-
tion, energy recovery, electricity production, emissions control, and ash handling.


4.1        SOLID WASTE FUEL DELIVERY, HANDLING, PROCESSING, AND
           COMBUSTION
4.1.1           SITE ACCESS, TRUCK WEIGHING, AND TRAFFIC FLOW
The main entrance to FCCRWTE will be located at the end of Metropolitan Court. An
additional rear gate will provide access to the BMWWTP. FCCRWTE will accommodate
multiple types of vehicles entering and exiting the site. This section describes these vari-
ous types of vehicles and the traffic pattern they will follow while on site.


The main gate will be open during delivery hours and will be monitored with a closed-
circuit television by the control room operators. Trucks will proceed directly to the scales
and the tipping floor on FCCRWTE's interior roads. Queuing will be onsite, thereby pos-
ing no anticipated impacts to existing traffic.

A traffic impact study was performed for FCCRWTE by Rummel, Klepper & Kahl, LLP
(RK&K) (Appendix B). The study evaluated the anticipated impact of FCCRWTE traffic
in light of county-anticipated future growth in the corridor (by other property owners)
within the FCCRWTE timeline. A final report was submitted to the Frederick County Di-
vision of Permitting and Development Review in December 2010, which addressed all
comments provided by the Division, as well as those provided by the Maryland State
Highway Administration. The traffic impact study report identified roadway network im-
provements needed to accommodate impacts associated with future growth in the area
and the minor increases in traffic caused by the operation of FCCRWTE. With these im-
provements in place, intersections will operate at acceptable levels when FCCRWTE is in
operation. Transportation issues have been addressed in accordance with Frederick Coun-
ty's adequate public facility ordinance guidelines.


Solid waste will be delivered to FCCRWTE by self-unloading waste collection trucks and
transfer trailers that are either self-unloading or need to be tipped. Vehicles will enter at
the main entrance security gate located on the south side of FCCRWTE and proceed to
the truck scale(s) to be weighed (if required). After being weighed, vehicles will proceed
west and then south to enter the tipping bay building through the door on the west side.
Before entering the building, trucks will be queued within the two 13-ft-wide egress lanes
that extend approximately 1,300 ft from the tipping bay building to a point just beyond
the truck scales. In the tipping bay building, transfer trailers will be guided to the solid
waste storage pit (or the trailer tipper), while waste collection trucks will be directed to
the floor.


Vehicular traffic on the tipping floor will be controlled by an operator. The operator will
instruct trucks as to when to enter or where to discharge their load. Trash collection
trucks and self-emptying trash transfer trucks will enter the west door of the tipping bay
building, turn right, and back up to the southern (pit) end of the tipping floor. There will
be adequate space for turnaround and backing up to the pit within the tipping floor area.




Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-2      Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--062712
Transfer trailers that need to use the tipper to offload will also enter the west door of the
tipping bay building and back onto the tipper. These transfer trailers will drive out of the
tipping bay building out of the east door if they have tared and approved to exit without a
weigh-out. A movement study was performed by RK&K to verify all transfer trailer
movements to and from the tipper.


Sewage sludge trucks will also enter the west door of the tipping bay building, turn left,
and back up to the sewage sludge receiving pit. During this short movement, trash trucks
will need to pause driving on or off the west side of the tipping floor.


After unloading the contents in the tipping bay, self-unloading trucks will typically exit
the tipping bay through the same door on the west side. They will then proceed north and
then east toward the truck scales to be weighed again, and then travel south to exit
FCCRWTE through the main gate.


Sludge trucks will deliver sludge to the sewage sludge area of FCCRWTE and will be
timed so as not to overload the sludge pit. Frederick and Carroll Counties will make ar-
rangements for storage or alternate disposal of the sludge during Facility outages. Sludge
delivery trucks will weigh in and out at the Facility scales. Small quantities of waste lu-
brication oil (derived from onsite vehicle/equipment oil changes) may be added to the
sludge to facilitate pumping. Appropriate regulatory approvals will be obtained for utili-
zation of used oil under the air permit regulations.


After unloading the contents, transfer trailers that require tipping and do not require re-
weighing will typically leave the tipping bay through the door located on the east side of
the bay and proceed south to exit FCCRWTE through the main gate. Some transfer trailer
trucks may proceed to the ash and metal recovery building to provide ash haul back to
Frederick or Carroll County landfills or other designated facilities.


Ash trucks will enter the main gate on the south side of FCCRWTE. Once the trucks are
beyond the scale area, they will turn left and enter the ash and metal recovery building.



Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-3       Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
After the ash trucks have been loaded, they will pass through the wheel wash and then
exit the building on the south side. The wheel wash station wastewater is one of the mis-
cellaneous services water uses shown on the water balance diagram depicted in Fig-
ure 4-11. This water balance shows how water within FCCRWTE is used and includes
contact water. Water that comes in contract with the ash will be collected and managed in
the contact water system as depicted on the drawing and will not be discharged into the
stormwater collection system.


Once out of the building, ash trucks will make an immediate left to advance toward the
truck scales for weighing. After weighing, they will again turn left and take the loop road
immediately west of the ash and metal recovery building and exit through the main gate
of FCCRWTE.


It should be noted that to prevent the loss of ash during transport, the following measures
will be implemented:
                        Bottom ash will be quenched with water in the ram ash expeller. The ram
                        ash expeller will squeeze out free water upon discharge but will leave the
                        bottom ash moist.
                        Fly ash will be wetted during ash conditioning in a pug mill to reduce dust-
                        ing. Water content of the combined ash will be between 10 and 20 percent.
                        The fly ash will be combined with the bottom ash before being loaded into
                        trucks for transportation offsite.
                        Ash trucks will be covered and fitted with leak proof doors (gasket seals) to
                        keep the ash with the ash truck until it has reached the disposal site.


FCCRWTE's main three-lane road, which will be used by the waste and ash trucks for
delivery of waste and removal of ash, as well as the Facility's secondary roads and park-
ing areas, will be swept periodically by FCCRWTE's road sweeper to minimize genera-
tion of airborne dust by vehicular traffic. Trash will be collected daily from the plant site
and from the approach roads, as necessary.

Bulky materials, recovered metal, and other unacceptable solid wastes will be stored in
30- to 50-cubic-yard containers. The containers will be picked up when full and replaced
with empty ones. The specific locations of these containers on the tipping floor will vary
depending on the operations (e.g., away from active tipping bays, which may change over
the course of a day).


Visitors to FCCRWTE will enter through the main gate and proceed directly to the visi-
tors' parking area east of the administration building. Visitors will check-in at the admin-
istration building. When leaving FCCRWTE, they will exit directly through the main
gate.


Equipment and supply delivery vehicles will follow informational signage on the site to
proceed to their required destination areas.


4.1.2          RECEIVING, UNLOADING, SCREENING, AND STORAGE
FCCRWTE is designed to operate and accept delivery of waste 24 hours per day,
365 days per year. Solid waste will be delivered to FCCRWTE's tipping bay building by
waste collection trucks and transfer trailers. Authorized personnel will be onsite at all
times FCCRWTE is operating. A sign will be posted at the entrance identifying the deliv-
ery hours.


Solid waste from waste collection trucks will be discharged onto the tipping floor to al-
low for waste inspection by loader operator before being added to the solid waste storage
pit. Transfer trailers will discharge directly to the pit, as waste has already been previous-
ly inspected at the transfer station prior to loading into the transfer trailer. Self-tipping
trailers will unload directly into the solid waste storage pit, while nonself-tipping trailers
will be positioned on the trailer tipper to discharge into the solid waste storage pit. There
will be a tipping floor operator that will coordinate traffic in and out of the tipping bay
building. Operations on the tipping floor will be conducted in manner such that a truck
may be directed to an area near the solid waste storage pit, but separate from the ongoing
unloading operations, for the inspection of the load.



Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-5       Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
The floor of the tipping bay building will be sloped slightly to drain into the solid waste
storage pit (Figure 3-2). This will avoid pooling of water in the tipping bay building.
Heavy duty concrete curbs, suitable for solid waste trucks, will be provided at the edge of
the tipping bay (in front of the solid waste storage pit). A maintenance program will be in
place to keep the tipping bay in a good condition. Figures 4-1A, 4-1B, and 4-1C show the
curb location and detail. Figure 4-1B also shows the slope of the floor.


The clearance from the roof truss to the tipping floor will be sufficient for trucks with
dump bodies to unload. The loader operator will inspect loads as they are received and
will move aside any nonprocessible materials for load-out and disposal. The tipping floor
slab will be constructed with 4,000 to 5,000 pounds per square inch concrete-wearing
surface to meet the demanding requirements of truck and loader traffic.


FCCRWTE will include a permanently installed trailer tipper to discharge waste from the
transfer trailers into the solid waste storage pit. The trailer tipper will be located along the
west wall of the tipping bay building and recessed into the tipping floor. The transfer
trailers will be jockeyed onto the trailer platform. The tipper will elevate the trailer to an
angle of approximately 63 degrees to ensure waste flows via gravity into the pit. This fea-
ture requires that the roof of the tipping bay building be approximately 60 ft above the
tipping floor to provide the necessary clearance for a trailer in its upright (discharge) po-
sition. The roof of the building will be designed to provide this clearance.


The dimensions of the solid waste storage pit are 150 ft long, 70 ft wide, and 38 ft deep
from the tipping floor to the bottom of the pit. The pit will provide 5 days of storage at
1,500 tpd, if the solid waste is stacked in accordance with the specification requirement
(minimum of two-thirds of the total storage volume to be below the tipping floor and not
more than one-third of the total volume above the pit to the level of the charging hop-
pers). A solid waste density of 700 pounds per cubic yard (yd3) is expected and was used
to size the pit. Table 4-1 summarizes the storage capacity of the solid waste storage pit.
Figure 4-1 illustrates a longitudinal elevation of the Facility. Figures 4-1A and 4-1B de-
pict the solid waste storage pit with tipping bay plan and the solid waste storage pit with
tipping bay section, respectively. Figure 4-1C provides the typical construction details.

The sewage sludge will be transported from BMWWTP through FCCRWTE's rear gate
and from other authorized sites through the main gate by truck.


The sewage sludge building is located adjacent to the tipping bay building, and access is
through the tipping bay. Sewage sludge delivery trucks will first enter the tipping bay
and, from there, back up through a roll-up access door into the sewage sludge building.
The overall storage pit dimensions are 26 ft long, 10 ft wide, and 10 ft deep and will have
a storage capacity of 1,485 cubic feet. The solid waste storage pit has been sized to store
two trucks worth of sewage sludge. If the sewage inventory in the refuse pit is all com-
busted, then sludge combustion would be discontinued until the next delivery of sewage
sludge is made. It is not necessary to store a large inventory of sewage sludge at
FCCRWTE, as deliveries will be spread over time, and storage is at the Ballenger Creek
McKinney WWTP, the location where the sludge is generated. Figure 4-2 depicts the
sewage sludge building plan/sections view.


4.1.3          SOLID WASTE FUEL HANDLING
Two overhead cranes will transfer processible waste from the solid waste storage pit into
the feed hoppers and will also be used for mixing, fluffing, and stacking solid waste in
the storage pit. The cranes are designed as bridge cranes with a grab trolley, hoisting
gear, and electro-hydraulic motor grab. The crane system can feed the combustor and mix
the waste in continuous operation.


The cranes will be controlled separately by operators in the crane control room. This con-
trol room will provide line-of-sight view of the combustor feed hoppers and all areas of
the storage pit. From this observation point, the crane operator will be able to readily
monitor the discharge of solid waste from the solid waste trucks on the tipping floor into
the pit.


The cranes will be equipped with manual and automatic preprogrammed controls for dis-
charge of solid waste into the feed hopper. The crane control pulpit will include a two-
way communication system for direct contact with the main control room, reception area,

and other locations where required. Oversized objects will be removed either during the
offloading process on the tipping floor or by using the overhead crane during the mixing
and fluffing process prior to feeding into the combustor. These objects will be stored
briefly for direct load-out to trucks at the tipping floor level.


The sewage sludge handling equipment will consist of a twin-auger screw conveyor and
two hydraulically driven high-density solids (sludge) pumps to extract the sludge out of
the sewage sludge storage pit (Figure 4-2) and deliver it to the inlet chutes of both com-
bustors. The sewage sludge storage pit will have sloping longitudinal side walls with a
twin-auger screw conveyor located at the bottom of the pit. The conveyor will run across
the entire length of the pit, through the pit's wall, and feed the two sludge pumps located
in an adjacent pump room. To accomplish this, the screw conveyor will have two dis-
charge openings, one for each pump. Each opening will have a slide gate to isolate the
sludge pump that is not in operation.


Each sludge pump will be capable of providing sludge to both combustors simultaneously
(Figure 4-3). The discharge of the pumps will be piped up to the combustor's feed chute,
where the sewage sludge will be fed into the combustor with the other incoming
processible waste. The sludge feed piping will be equipped with automated flow diverter
valves that will be used to balance the flow of sewage sludge between the two combus-
tors.


4.1.4          SOLID WASTE FUEL PROCESSING
Each combustor will be equipped with a solid waste feed hopper and charging chute
(Figure 4-1). The feed hopper will be a rugged, heavily reinforced unit incorporating a
combination arch breaker and cutoff gate. The rear wall of the solid waste hopper will
include a hydraulically activated pivoting plate. Controls located in the crane operator's
area will allow the plate to be activated as an arch breaker or as a cutoff gate. The arch
breaker will serve to dislodge bulky items, which could block or restrict solid waste flow
in the solid waste feed chute. To monitor the waste height in the charging chute, a relia-
ble, low-maintenance level monitor will be installed.

   SOLID WASTE FUEL HANDLING AND ODOR CONTROL

The feed hopper system consists of a hopper, hopper flap gate, feed chute, and support
frame. The hopper flap gates will seal the combustion chamber from the solid waste stor-
age pit and receiving hall prior to waste charging and during system shutdown. The slope
of the hopper walls and the arrangement of the hopper flap gate will be designed to pre-
vent bridging and, thereby, ensure continuous delivery of waste to the combustion grate.
The height of the feed chute will facilitate a sufficiently high waste column that seals the
combustion chamber from the solid waste storage pit and receiving hall during combus-
tion. The feed chute will be designed to resist thermal stress that may occur during opera-
tion, with a cooling water jacket to cool the feed chute parts that are potentially exposed
to extreme thermal loads.


From the feed chute, waste will fall on the horizontal feeder table, over which the hydrau-
lically driven ram feeder slides. As the feeder slides in and out, waste will be pushed onto
the combustion grate. The speed of the forward stroke can be varied with each stroke.
Varying the speed of the forward stroke will allow uniform metering and immediate ad-
justment of the volume of waste required to match the combustion conditions and the sys-
tem set points; this allows for the same volumetric quantity of waste to be pushed onto
the combustion grate. Each return stroke will be made at the same speed.


4.1.5          SOLID WASTE FUEL COMBUSTION
The grate will consist of three lanes with five zones or grate elements. The first two zones
will be water-cooled, and the remaining zones will be air-cooled. The movement of the
individual grate elements will be adjusted by means of an electronic pulse control system.


For a standard combustion profile, the optimum pulse count will be preset for each grate
element. For example, the grate elements in the main combustion zone will have a higher
pulse count than those in the burnout zone. If waste throughput needs to be changed, the
pulse counts for the entire grate can be uniformly increased or decreased by the control
room operator, while maintaining the relative speeds of the individual grate elements.


If there is a change in calorific value that changes the combustion profile on the grate, the
specific pulse count for the individual grate elements can be adjusted during operation to

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-16     Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
reflect the new combustion conditions. The number of working strokes impacts not only
the throughput rate and, therefore, the volume, but also the stoking effect and, thus, the
combustion profile.


The heat from the two water-cooled grate zones is recovered and returned to the furnace
with the primary air. The first stage of the primary air preheater cools the hot water com-
ing from the grate. In case emergency cooling is required, the system will be provided
with a potable water connection for temporary backup service. Figure 4-4 shows the pro-
cess flow diagram for thermal treatment.


The primary air system controls and delivers under-grate combustion air to the boiler. Air
will be drawn in from the tipping floor and storage pit charging area and delivered sepa-
rately, by the primary air fan, to the underside of the individual grate zones. The system
will be comprised of the air ducts from the inlet to the fan, the fan to the air heater, and
the air heater to the grate sifting hoppers. Air from the sewage sludge area will also be
ducted to the intake of the primary air fans for each boiler for odor control.


The air-flow rate will be controlled by a variable frequency speed control system, via the
combustion control system (CCS), and will also have the option of inlet vane damper
control. With this system, the various primary air-flow rates required for optimum com-
bustion will be provided for each individual grate zone. Air will be preheated to increase
cycle efficiency.


The primary air fan will be equipped with openings for inspection and cleaning purposes.
The fan and its drive will be mounted on a common steel frame structure (base plate).


The secondary air system delivers and regulates secondary combustion air to mix the flue
gases and complete the combustion process above the grates. Some volatile components
of the waste do not combust directly on the grate, but instead will be released on expo-
sure to heat and then burn as they pass through the furnace.

4.1.5.1            Flue Gas Recirculation
FCCRWTE will be equipped with a flue gas recirculation system comprised of the flue
gas recirculation fan, damper, and ducts to the combustion chamber. The recirculation
causes an effective mixing of the flue gases. Flue gas recirculation increases boiler effi-
ciency, and the volume of flue gas requiring waste gas treatment is reduced. Flue gas re-
circulation has been used for many years in utility boilers that burn solid fuels.


4.1.5.2            Natural Gas-Fired Startup and Auxiliary Burner
FCCRWTE will be connected to the local utility's natural gas system by way of the
Facility's gas metering station. Natural gas will fuel the auxiliary burners during initial
startup of the combustor and heat up the combustion chamber to the specified minimum
temperature before waste charging begins. The auxiliary burner system will also be used
for backup firing if the temperature of the flue gases drops below the specified minimum
temperature during upset waste-combustion operations and will have the capability of
firing the combustors to 60 percent of maximum capacity rating.


When the combustor is shut down, the auxiliary burners will maintain the minimum tem-
perature in the combustion chamber until the waste on the grate has been burned out. The
gas-fired auxiliary burners have been specially designed for processible waste combus-
tion units. The burners will be located in the upper part of the combustion chamber.


The combustion air fan, provided separately for the burners, will aspirate the necessary
air from the boiler room and will blow it into the air manifold. The control damper will
control the volume of combustion air.


4.1.5.3            Bottom Ash Extractor
The bottom ash extractor quenches and discharges bottom ash from the furnace and
riddlings from the ram feeder and grate hoppers. Riddlings and bottom ash remaining at
the end of the combustion grate will fall into a water-filled, trough-shaped bottom ash
extractor. The bottom ash discharge chute and the bottom ash extractor will be movable
and connected to each other in an air-tight manner to provide isolation from the combus-
tion chamber. The water level control circuit will provide a constant water level in the

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-19      Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
extractor. Bottom ash extractor water will be discharged into a concrete contact sump.
The water vapor that is formed by evaporation in the bottom ash discharge chute will rise
back into the combustion chamber, and the water vapor collected in the bottom ash dis-
charge hood will be fed by axial fan back into the bottom ash chute.


A hydraulically driven ram will feed the bottom ash from the bottom ash extractor to a
bottom ash conveyor. The bottom ash extractor will be designed to handle variable bot-
tom ash discharge from the combustion unit. The design of the bottom ash extractor, in-
cluding the inlet and discharge cross sections, will allow large pieces of bottom ash and
metal to be discharged without difficulty.


4.1.5.4            Grate Siftings
The combustion grate floor will be designed to minimize the amount of grate siftings that
fall between and below the grates. Under each grate element and under each ram feeder
will be a siftings hopper and chute for the discharge of the grate siftings. The chutes will
lead to a wet drag chain conveyor. The chutes will be immersed under the water level in-
side the conveyor, thus ensuring the exclusion of air intake. The wet drag chain conveyor
will quench the grate siftings and transport them toward the bottom ash extractor. To
provide for cleaning, appropriate openings will be installed on the conveyor.


4.1.5.5            Combustion Control System
The CCS allows a largely automatic and safe operation based on the control room opera-
tor's set point for steam load. Even at varying waste qualities, compliance with permitted
operating conditions, such as the combustion chamber temperature and the oxygen con-
tent in the flue gas, as well as an efficient gas and bottom ash burnout, can be assured by
means of the control interventions. The overall goals of the CCS are to: (1) keep the
steam flow preset by the operator constant, (2) keep the flue gas flow rate constant, (i.e.,
depending on the steam flow set point and the existing calorific value of the waste),
(3) maintain combustion temperature within the permissible limits, and (4) ensure an ef-
ficient flue gas burnout by keeping the oxygen content within the permissible limits with
simultaneous control of the combustion temperature.



Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-20    Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
The values for the ram feeder speed and the grate track stroke frequency, as well as the
volume flows for total air (primary air and secondary air) and recirculated flue gas, will
be calculated from the steam flow set point. Applying these values, the basic combustion
conditions will be preset.


The measured steam flow and the oxygen content in the flue gas are representative of the
thermal capacity. When the combustion capacity is too low, the primary air-flow below
the grate will be increased; simultaneously, the secondary airflow above the grate will be
decreased by the same rate. With this intervention, the combustion capacity will be in-
creased at constant total air supply. At the same time, the grate stroke frequency and the
ram feeder speed will be increased and, as a result, the fire will be intensified and the
waste throughput improved. Conversely, when the combustion capacity is too high, the
control interventions will be reversed.


The CCS will automate the combustion process in such a way that the operator has to on-
ly determine: (1) the set point for the desired steam flow rate, and (2) an estimation of
the HHV of the waste being fed (calorific value adjustment). In case of a change of the
waste quality, basic set points will be simultaneously modified by means of the calorific
value adjustment so that favorable combustion conditions are always maintained. Addi-
tionally, manual intervention will be possible allowing the operator to further optimize
the combustion process if necessary.


The CCS will be designed so that FCCRWTE is operated within its capacity limits. This
will be assured by program-internal limits, adjustment of the control strategies, and fol-
low-up on the set points. The primary air distribution over the length of the grate will be
continuously adapted to the combustion process by means of the zone-wise control sys-
tem.


The CCS will continuously measure and process steam flow rate, oxygen content at the
boiler outlet, primary air flow rate, secondary air flow rate, flue gas recirculation flow
rate, primary air temperature, and control variables. The CCS will activate control ele-
ments for the ram feeder (speed) via autonomous control cabinet, grate stroke frequency

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-21    Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
via autonomous control cabinet, primary air fan (frequency converter), secondary air fan
(frequency converter), control valve primary air preheater (steam valve), and primary air
dampers per zone (position).


4.1.5.6            Four-Pass Steam Boiler
The steam boiler will consist of the following sections:
                        First Pass--Vertical radiation upward pass, made of membrane water walls
                        in the furnace above the grates.
                        Second Pass--Vertical radiation downward pass, made of membrane water
                        walls and one dividing wall with superheater bundles.
                        Third Pass--Vertical radiation upward pass, made of membrane water
                        walls, an evaporator bundle, an economizer bundle, and superheater bun-
                        dles.
                        Fourth Pass--Vertical convection pass, made of economizer bundles.


4.1.5.7            Online Cleaning of Heat Exchange Surfaces
FCCRWTE will employ online cleaning of heat exchange surfaces by means of soot
blowers. The effectiveness of the heat exchanger surface is reduced during boiler opera-
tion due to fouling. The heat exchanger bundles in the second, third, and fourth vertical
passes of the boiler will be cleaned online by soot blowers. Released soot will be cap-
tured by the fabric filter system.


4.1.5.8            Refractory Lining of Furnace and First Pass
WTI will use a refractory lined furnace surface to protect heating surfaces from high flue
gas temperatures (corrosion protection) and achieve high residence time of the flue gases
at high temperatures for a complete burnout.


4.1.5.9            Induced Draft Fan
The induced draft (ID) fan maintains the necessary balance draft in the combustion
chamber and conveyance of the flue gases through the whole flue gas cleaning system. It
generates the negative pressure for the gases in the upper combustion chamber.



Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-22             Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
Connections between the individual components up to and from the ID fan will be made
via the flue gas ducts. The quantity of flue gas handled by the ID fan will be regulated by
means of a variable frequency speed control system as a function of combustion chamber
pressure.


The ID fan will be designed and constructed to convey the required quantity of flue gas
over the entire load range of the combustion capacity diagram.


4.1.5.10 Dry Flue Gas Ducts
The flue gas ducts will be sized such that excessive pressure losses, as well as excessively
high gas flow velocities, are avoided. Special attention will be given to optimum flow
dynamics, as well as to the design of diverters and inlets. Where required, access doors
will be provided for the inspection and maintenance of the flue gas ducts and the Facility
components associated with them.


The flue gas ducts between the ID fan and the stack will be operated under positive pres-
sure. These ducts will feature leak-tight designs (particularly the doors and expansion
joints).


The individual flue gas cleaning components will be connected to each other by means of
ductwork. These ducts will provide a path for the flue gas to travel between components
(e.g., from the boiler to the air emissions control equipment to the ID fan). Instrument
ports are needed for flue gas measurements in the entire flue gas duct system.


4.1.5.11 Stack
The stack will be of freestanding two-flue construction. The outlet of the stack flues will
be 270 ft above ground level.


The cleaned flue gas will enter the stack with a temperature of approximately 260 degrees
Fahrenheit (°F) at nominal load. The individual stack pipe sections will be joined to form
a gas-tight seal.



Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-23    Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
Below the flue gas inlet, condensed water vapor or rainwater will be collected on an in-
clined stack base plate and discharged via a condensate discharge line. The collected
condensate discharge will be pumped into the bottom ash water basin.


4.2        STEAM-WATER CYCLE
4.2.1           TURBINE/GENERATOR SET
Steam produced by the boiler will be sent to a steam turbine/generator set. The tur-
bine/generator set will convert the thermal energy of the steam to mechanical energy,
then to electrical energy for the needs of the entire Facility, and to the external electrical
grid. The turbine/generator will have a nominal gross rating of 55 MW. The internal elec-
trical needs are estimated to be 5 to 10 MW, leaving approximately 45 to 50 MW for ex-
port power to the Allegheny Power electrical network.


The steam flow to the turbine will be controlled by the steam turbine's pressure control
valve. HP steam will be extracted for use in the air preheater. Medium-pressure (MP)
steam will be extracted for feed-water deaeration and air preheating. Low-pressure (LP)
steam will be extracted for feed-water heating and internal consumption in FCCRWTE.


After the steam turbine, the expanded steam will be condensed in a water-cooled surface
condenser. Demineralized water can be added for makeup from the demineralized water
storage tank.


The energy recovery system will include:
                        Controlled extraction/condensing turbine (with hydraulic and lubricating oil
                        system).
                        Generator with voltage regulator.
                        Electrical equipment for the generator.
                        A local control panel for local operation, including interface to the distribut-
                        ed control system.


During regular Facility operation, pressure control in the main steam header will be per-
formed by the steam turbine's pressure control valve. In case of a trip of the steam tur-

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-24                Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
bine, a controlled main steam release to a bypass condenser via the turbine bypass system
will be initiated to prevent the boiler safety valves from relieving pressure.


In the event that the steam turbine's admission capacity is exceeded, the turbine bypass
system will be activated, which will then take over pressure control in the main steam
header.


The turbine bypass system will also be active during startup and shutdown of the boiler to
minimize any water losses (short-time steam blow-off only).


In case of a trip of the turbine and also at partial load, a steam pressure reduction station,
between the HP steam header and the MP header, and the MP and LP steam header, will
provide the supply of MP and LP steam to the internal systems.


4.2.2          CONTROL AND LUBRICATION OIL SUPPLY
For the turbine/generator, a control and lubrication oil system will be provided, including
oil reservoir, oil cooler, and lubrication oil centrifuge for lubrication oil conditioning to-
gether with fan extraction, vented in a safe location.


The control and lubrication oil system supplies the necessary oil for the bearings and the
control oil for control system of the turbine. The oil tank is made from carbon steel and
located next to the turbine casing. The main oil pump circulates oil through the system.
The emergency oil pump will be used during startup and also in emergency situations.


4.2.3          COOLING SYSTEM
The major equipment of the cooling system will consist of a surface condenser, turbine
bypass condenser, and mechanical draft cooling tower. The cooling system will be ade-
quately sized to accommodate the maximum continuous operating steam flow.


The steam surface condenser extracts the latent heat of vaporization from the turbine ex-
haust (a mixture of steam and water) and transfers this heat to the cooling water. The sur-
face condenser will consist of a series of parallel tubes through which cooling water will

pass, enclosed in a metal condenser located below the turbine/generator. The surface
condenser will have a design heat-removal capacity for approximately 340 million Btu
per hour. The exhaust steam from the turbine enters the upper region of the condenser
and passes down, around, and between the tubes in the tube bundle, thereby condensing
the steam.


The dump or bypass condenser will be supplied, in conjunction with a surface condenser,
for use during periods of startup, shutdown, and turbine/generator unavailability. The by-
pass condenser will receive and condense HP boiler steam and return the condensate to
the deaerator.


The cooling tower rejects heat absorbed by the cooling water system in the surface con-
denser and collects the water in a concrete basin. The cooling water will be pumped by
circulating water pumps located in the tower basin through the circulating water system,
returning the water to the tower. The tower will be noise-abated and adhere to applicable
standard fire and lightning codes. Treated effluent from the BMWWTP will normally
provide makeup water to replace cooling tower evaporation, drift, and blowdown.


The cooling tower will be a three-cell, counter-flow mechanical draft-type tower. The
structure will have high-efficiency fill and drift eliminators. Each cell will contain a fan
with an electric-drive motor.


Maximum total dissolved solids concentration in the cooling tower recirculating water
closed loop system is estimated to be 5,500 milligrams per liter. Particulate emissions
from the cooling tower will be controlled using high-efficiency drift eliminators. The
cooling tower will achieve a drift loss rate of no more than 0.0005 percent of the cooling
tower recirculating water flow.


The feed-water system will consist of the deaerator/feed-water storage tank with a useful
volume of approximately 10 to 20 minutes of operation, two electric motor driven feed-
water pumps, and associated pipes and valves. It will feed the boiler with deaerated water
of feed-water quality and provide spray water as cooling water for the attemperators in

the superheater, steam pressure reduction station of the turbine bypass, and HP/MP/LP
steam pressure reduction station.


The condensate system will consist of two condensate pumps, steam ejector condenser,
one LP condensate heater, gland steam condenser, two boiler external economizers, pip-
ing for condensate coming from the condenser to the deaerator, and condensate or drain
piping from the LP feed-water heater, ejector condenser, and the gland steam condenser
to the condenser hotwell.


4.3        AIR QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEM
An AQCS will be installed to reduce emissions in the flue gas prior to flue gas exit at the
stack. The AQCS will be designed to ensure compliance with federal and state air pollu-
tion control laws and regulation, which restrict regulated emissions to certain allowable
limits.


The AQCS consists of a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit with an ammonia injec-
tion system to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx); a spray dryer absorber (SDA) such as a
Turbosorp® reactor or equivalent to remove acid gases, mercury, and organic contami-
nants; and a fabric filter to remove particulates.


FCCRWTE will be designed to satisfy all emission requirements required by 40 CFR 60,
Subpart Eb. Oxygen content for emission levels will be 7 percent dry. Detailed emissions
information is provided in FCCRWTE's air permit application filed separately with the
Maryland Department of the Environment's Air Resource Management Administration.


4.3.1          ACID GAS, PARTICULATE, TRACE METALS, AND DIOXIN/FURAN
               CONTROL
FCCRWTE will use a semi-dry acid gas removal system such as the Turbosorp® process.
The Turbosorp® process consists of a closely integrated Turbosorp® reactor and fabric
filter. Figure 4-5 illustrates the system.

        FIGURE 4-5.
        TURBOSORP REACTOR AND FABRIC FILTER
The Turbosorp® reactor removes acid gases (i.e., hydrochloric acid [HCl], sulfur dioxide
[SO2], sulfur trioxide [SO3], and hydrofluoric acid [HF]), mercury, and dioxins/furans
and other organics in a fluidized bed of hydrated lime and a carbon-based sorbent. Effi-
cient removal of contaminants from the flue gas at a temperature of approximately 295°F
is achieved through chemical reactions with the injected hydrated lime and adsorption
with the sorbent. The fabric filter will remove particulates from the flue gas stream.


4.3.1.1            Spray Dryer Absorber
An SDA is a semi-dry acid gas removal system that uses finely atomized, alkaline lime
slurry droplets in an absorbing chamber to remove acid gases from the flue gas stream.
The lime slurry droplets absorb the gases and react to form salts. Flue gas heat evaporates
the water, leaving tiny particles of mixed salt and unreacted alkali. Cooling the gas has
been proven to be a major factor influencing the removal of acid gases. The semi-dry flue
gas treatment process is designed to achieve high acid gas (i.e., SO2, SO3, HCl, and HF)
removal efficiencies by contact-sorption. At the same time, removal of mercury and or-
ganic contaminants, such as dioxins and furans, are also enhanced by adsorption on a
carbon-based sorbent (such as activated carbon, lignite, or other carbon-based reagent).
The fly ash, hydrated lime, sorbent, and other solids will be separated from the flue gas in
the downstream fabric filter. The separated lime, sorbent, and other solids will be recircu-
lated back into the SDA to maximize use of any unreacted lime or sorbent.


The semi-dry acid gas removal process is designed to operate from 60- to 110-percent
load with respect to the design flue gas flow rate.


4.3.1.2            Hydrated Lime Supply
Hydrated lime will be delivered to the site in pneumatic trailers. A pneumatic transfer
system will convey the lime to two storage silos, each with a nominal capacity of
6,500 cubic feet (ft3), using the on-board truck compressor and the installed fill line. A
bin vent filter on the roof of each silo will separate the entrained lime from the conveying
air prior to discharging the air into the AQCS building. Level indicators installed in the
silos will prevent over-filling and will report actual levels to the distributed control sys-



Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-29     Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
tem. Safety dampers on the silos will protect the system from positive or negative over-
pressurization.


The discharge of lime from the silos will be facilitated by a mechanical discharge and
metering system. Hydrated lime will be conveyed to the Turbosorp® reactor pneumati-
cally and injected as a dry powder directly into the Turbosorp® reactor independent of
the water injection.


4.3.1.3            Carbon-Based Sorbent Supply
A carbon-based sorbent, such as activated carbon, lignite, or other carbon-based reagent,
will be delivered to the site in pneumatic trailers. A pneumatic transfer system will con-
vey the sorbent to the 2,500-ft3 storage silo, using the on-board truck compressor and the
installed fill line. A bin vent filter on the roof of the silo will separate the entrained
sorbent from the conveying air prior to discharging the air to the AQCS building. Level
indicators installed in the silo will prevent overfilling and report the actual levels to the
distributed control system. Safety dampers on the silo will protect the system from posi-
tive or negative over-pressurization.


The discharge from the sorbent silo will be facilitated by a mechanical discharge and
weight loss-based metering system. The sorbent will be conveyed to the Turbosorp® re-
actor pneumatically. The sorbent will be injected as a dry powder directly into the
Turbosorp® reactor independent of the water injection. The amount of sorbent injected
into the Turbosorp® reactor will be set during the initial commissioning/compliance
stack testing and annually thereafter.


4.3.1.4            Fabric Filter Flue Gas Particulate Removal
A pulse jet-type fabric filter removes particulates, including reacted lime, sorbent, fly ash,
and other solids from the flue gas after the Turbosorp® reactor. High particulate removal
efficiency will be accomplished primarily by mechanical filtration on the surface of the
fabric filter bag membrane. Additionally, secondary filtration will occur from filter cake
that builds up on the bag membranes. This filter cake will provide additional contact be-

tween the flue gas and adsorbents, providing some final secondary removal of acid gases
and mercury.


The dust and adsorbent-laden flue gas will directly enter the fabric filter from the
Turbosorp® reactor. To assure a uniform distribution of flow through the filter chambers,
the raw gas will be passed across distributor panels where coarse particles will be sepa-
rated and discharged directly into the hopper below. Each compartment will consist of
numerous, vertically arranged filter bags suspended from internal cages. The flue gas will
flow from the outside to the inside of the filter bags and will pass into the clean side of
the compartment and then into the common clean flue gas duct.


The flow characteristics created by the chamber geometry, as well as the pressure drop
across the bag membrane, will result in uniform gas flow through the filter bags. This
will cause uniform deposition of solids and absorbents on the outside of the individual
filter bags.


The filter bags will be cleaned automatically and sequentially to maintain the desired
pressure-drop set point. The cleaning of the filter bags will be initiated when the pressure
drop increases to the set point. An elapsed timer will ensure bags are cleaned at some
minimal frequency to ensure optimum gas flow through the fabric filter during short-term
transients of high flue gas flow periods. The collected solids on the fabric filter bags will
be released by sudden inflation of the bags with pulses of compressed air.


The compressed air pulses will force the solids to crumble and fall into the hoppers below
the filter bags. The solids will be removed from the hoppers by fluidized air pneumatic
conveyors. A major portion of the collected solids will be recirculated back into the
Turbosorp® reactor to maintain the fluidized bed level, while the rest of the solids will be
discharged and transported to the residue silo. The hoppers of the fabric filter compart-
ments can be isolated from the pneumatic conveyors by means of manually operated slide
gates to perform online inspections and maintenance.




Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-31     Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
In case of Facility shutdown, the solids are intended to remain in the hoppers and pneu-
matic conveyors for up to 72 hours. During longer shutdowns, the fabric filter will be
cleaned manually and the hoppers emptied into the fly ash collecting drag conveyor.


4.3.1.5            NOx Control System
Good steady-state combustion is important for optimizing NOx control system operation.
Good combustion control reduces NOx formation and maintains more consistent furnace
temperatures.


NOx emissions will also be controlled by SCR. The reaction of NOx with ammonia can be
efficiently accomplished at low temperatures (e.g., 446 to 460°F) in the presence of an
appropriate catalyst. NOx in the flue gas are converted to nitrogen gas and water.


Within the SCR process, a catalyst is used to lower the required reaction temperature to a
technically favorable level. The catalyst consists of titanium dioxide as support material
as well as vanadium pentoxide and tungsten trioxide as active substances in a ceramic
substrate.


Heating of flue gas upstream from the catalyst to the temperature required for the SCR
process is performed in the gas/gas heat exchanger. The flue gas coming out of the bag-
house will be heated up to approximately 428°F from 193°F using the gas/gas heat ex-
changer. Flue gas is cooled to approximately 329°F after the catalyst by means of the
same gas/gas heat exchanger.


The 19-percent aqueous ammonia solution is pumped from the storage tank to the ammo-
nia injection system. The ammonia solution is sprayed upstream from catalyst into the
flue gas duct together with compressed air. The ammonia flow of each injection nozzle is
measured to control an equal flow of each nozzle or detect a nozzle blockage. For main-
tenance, a service connection for flushing is installed for each nozzle.




Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-32     Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
A bypass duct enables the bypass of the complete SCR system during startup. The bypass
duct is equipped with double isolation dampers (with sealing air) in the inlet and outlet
zones.


4.3.1.6            Process Continuous Emissions Monitoring System
Dedicated process continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMSs) will be installed
on each combustor line. Separate analyzer trains will measure SO2/oxygen at the boiler
exit before the spray dryer and after the SCR to control the flow of hydrated lime. In ad-
dition, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, HCl, and NOx will be monitored at the SCR
outlet of each combustor line.


The CEMS and continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) will be interfaced into a
single, centralized, computer-based data acquisition system. The CEMS and COMS will
meet state, federal, and local permit requirements for data availability, accuracy, calibra-
tion and recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.


4.4        BOTTOM ASH, BOILER ASH, AND FLY ASH/SCRUBBER RESIDUE
           HANDLING AND STORAGE
Figures 4-6 through 4-10A provide material flow diagrams of the bottom ash, boiler ash,
and fly ash/scrubber residue handling and storage systems as well as the preliminary
equipment and conveyor arrangement for these systems and for the ash and metal recov-
ery building. The following subsections provide a narrative description of how these sys-
tems operate.


4.4.1          BOTTOM ASH HANDLING AND METAL RECOVERY
Bottom ash will fall from the end of the combustion grates through a chute and into a hy-
draulic ram-type bottom ash extractor. The ash will be quenched within the water-filled
extractor. The water vapor formed when the ash is quenched will rise into the combustion
chamber through the bottom ash chute. A level control circuit will be used to maintain a
constant water elevation in the extractor.

A relatively small quantity of ash will not make it to the end of the grate and instead, will
fall through small openings between grate blocks or air holes in the grates. This material
known as grate siftings or riddlings will be collected in a series of under-grate chutes that
lead to a wet drag conveyor. The drag conveyor will deposit the siftings into the bottom
ash extractor.


The main bottom ash vibrating pan conveyor, common to both units, will receive
quenched bottom ash from the two bottom ash extractors from each combustor. The main
vibrating conveyor will transfer the ash to a bottom ash belt conveyor. This conveyor,
fully enclosed within a gallery, in turn, will convey the bottom ash to a 6-inch finger deck
screen located inside the ash and metal recovery building. The 6-inch finger deck screen
is a large vibrating screen that will separate oversized material (primarily ferrous) from
the remaining bottom ash. The oversized fraction (bulkies) will be deposited into a stor-
age bunker at grade, while the remaining bottom ash will be fed by vibrating feeder onto
a belt transfer conveyor for transport to a rotating drum magnet. Ferrous metals removed
by the magnet will be discharged onto a belt conveyor that will transport the material and
drop it into the ferrous metal storage bunker at grade. The remaining bottom ash will be
transferred by belt conveyor to the nonferrous metals recovery train. The bottom ash will
be discharged from the transfer belt conveyor to a 0.375-inch feeder/screener. The
0.375-inch feeder/screener, in turn, will feed the nonferrous metals eddy current separa-
tor. In the eddy current separator, some nonferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, and
brass will be removed and discharged onto a transfer belt conveyor for deposit into the
nonferrous storage bunker at grade. Any bottom ash that passes through the 0.375-inch
feeder/screener (smaller particles) and the eddy current system will fall onto a reversible
stackout conveyor. The combined ash reversible stackout conveyor discharges bottom
ash along with fly ash off either end into the combined ash storage bunker before offsite
disposal. In the event the feeder/screener is out of service, a diverter gate will be activat-
ed to bypass the feeder/screener and send the bottom ash directly to the bunker. The bun-
kers are located inside the ash and metal recovery building.


Total ash produced will be between 22 and 32 percent by weight of incoming MSW, de-
pending on the characteristics of the MSW. The actual percentages of ferrous and nonfer-

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-43      Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
rous metal recovered will be dependent largely upon the percent by weight of ferrous and
nonferrous metal in the MSW delivered to FCCRWTE.


4.4.2          BOILER ASH
Boiler horizontal backpass sections present an obstacle to the flue gas stream and cause
some ash entrained in the flue gas to drop out. The residues that collect within the boil-
er's backpass hoppers are known collectively as boiler ash. Screw conveyors will collect
the boiler ash from the second and third pass and economizer hoppers of each boiler.
Double flap valves will be located above the boiler ash screw conveyors to provide air-
locks to prevent both ambient air from getting into the boiler and flue gas from getting
into the ash handling system. The screw conveyors will be routed to a main fly ash ele-
vating drag conveyor, common to both units, where the boiler ash will be comingled with
the ash collected from the AQCS equipment.


4.4.3          FLY ASH/SCRUBBER RESIDUE
Fly ash/scrubber residues will be discharged from each unit's Turbosorp® reactor recir-
culation bed through a double flap valve and screw feeder directly to the fly ash elevating
drag conveyor. Fly ash is also discharged from the corresponding fabric filter's pneumat-
ic recirculation conveyors through rotary valves to screw conveyors, which will be routed
to the same fly ash elevating drag conveyor. The height of the recirculation bed will con-
trol the rotary valve speed and fly ash discharge rate. The fly ash combines with the boil-
er ash within the common elevating drag conveyor where it is also combined with hy-
drated lime. The combined ash and lime will then be conveyed to the fly ash surge bin
within the fly ash surge bin enclosure. Pug mills/mixers will be used to wet the fly ash
discharged from the bin prior to discharging onto the fly ash elevating belt conveyor for
transport within a fully enclosed gallery to the ash and metal recovery building. Within
the building, the elevating conveyor will discharge onto the combined ash reversible
stackout conveyor where it is combined with the bottom ash prior to discharging off ei-
ther end into the combined ash storage bunker inside the ash and metal recovery building
for offsite disposal.

4.4.4          ASH STORAGE
Storage bunkers for the ash and metals will be located inside the ash and metal recovery
building separated by 20-ft-high structural concrete walls. The different storage bunkers
will be designed to hold the equivalent of a minimum of 5 days of residues during
FCCRWTE's normal operation at full load. All ferrous and nonferrous separation equip-
ment, along with feeders and conveyors, will be located on a platform(s) above these
walls. The bottom ash will be combined with fly ash on the combined ash reversible
stackout conveyor above the storage bunkers. A front-end loader will be used to load the
combined ash onto trucks for offsite disposal. Since the volume of bottom ash generated
is much larger than the volume of fly ash, there may be instances when the bottom ash
will not be combined with fly ash before loading onto the trucks.


A wheel wash system will be provided for trucks exiting the building. It will consist of
pumps, piping, and jets that spray water onto the tires to remove any ash dust that may
stick to the tires. Wash water will then be pumped to the contact water treatment system.


There will be an operator (truckmaster) in the ash and metal recovery building who will
control and guide the trucks to the loading location for the various ash components.


4.5        WATER MANAGEMENT
4.5.1          WATER USE
County water will be used in FCCRWTE's potable water system. It will be used in the
fire protection, service water, and makeup demineralizer systems. The makeup deminer-
alizer system will treat County water by means of reverse osmosis and electro-
deionization to produce demineralized water suitable for makeup to the boiler ­ turbine
cycle. The average County water use is estimated to be 35 gallons per minute or
50,400 gallons per day (gpd).


Treated effluent from the BMWWTP will be primarily used to make up for evaporation,
drift, and blowdown in the cooling tower. The rate of cooling tower blowdown will be
regulated to produce approximately three to six cycles of concentration. A portion of the
cooling tower blowdown will be sent to the wastewater tank as needed to supply the air

quality control and ash handling systems. The remainder of cooling tower blowdown will
be discharged to the Potomac River through a diffuser. The average BMWWTP effluent
water use is estimated to be 1.0 to 1.2 million gpd.


Water chemistry in the cooling tower and cooling water system will be controlled by the
addition of chemicals. Sodium hypochlorite will be added to prevent biological fouling,
and sulfuric acid will be added to prevent scaling. A corrosion inhibitor will also be add-
ed.


4.5.2          WASTEWATER
The only wastewater to be discharged from FCCRWTE will be cooling tower blowdown.
The average quantity is estimated to be 0.1 to 0.4 million gpd. The cooling tower blow-
down will be discharged to the Potomac River. A National Pollutant Discharge Elimina-
tion System application was submitted to MDE in February 2011, and it identifies the
routing of the discharge to the Potomac River via an existing Frederick County Division
of Utilities and Solid Waste Management's pipeline with diffuser. Supporting infor-
mation included in the application demonstrates the impacts to the Potomac River are
minimal. Figure 4-11 depicts the water balance for the Facility.


A wastewater tank will receive rejects from reverse osmosis trains in the makeup demin-
eralizer system, boiler blowdown, and a portion of the cooling tower blowdown. Water
for the AQCS will be supplied from this tank. It will be evaporated in this system.


Water that may come into contact with ash, including floor and equipment wash down
water and blowdown from ash area air scrubbers, will be collected and treated in a con-
tact water treatment system. This water, as well as some water from the wastewater tank,
will be used as make-up to the bottom ash and fly ash handling systems.


Figures 4-12 and 4-13 provide a flow diagram of the biosolids building drain system and
contact water wastewater treatment system, respectively.

4.5.3          STORMWATER
Pollutants from the handling, transfer, or storage wastes, including accidental spills and
rainfall events, will be collected and properly disposed. A stormwater management con-
cept plan (SKC-204, Stormwater Management Plan) has been submitted to and received
approval by the Frederick County Division of Permitting and Development Review as
required by Frederick County Ordinance §1-15.2-5.1, Stormwater Management Plans. A
final stormwater management development plan, including final erosion and sedimenta-
tion control plan, will be submitted to Frederick County. A preliminary erosion and sed-
imentation control plan and a response to comments letter have also been provided to the
Frederick Soil Conservation Distrct. A notice of intent for a construction general permit
will be submitted to MDE after all local approvals have been received and prior to the
initiation of construction. Figures 4-14 and 4-15 depict the stormwater management plan
and associated stormwater management details, respectively.


4.6        ODOR CONTROL
There will be three areas in FCCRWTE from which odors generated by the MSW and the
sewage sludge will emanate. These areas are the tipping bay building, solid waste storage
pit, and sewage sludge building (see Figure 4-3).


The tipping bay building is directly connected to the adjacent solid waste storage pit;
there is no dividing wall between the two. For odor generation and control consideration,
these two areas can be considered as one. The sewage sludge building is located adjacent
and connected to the tipping bay.


Odor control in the tipping bay building and solid waste storage pit areas will be achieved
by maintaining these areas under negative pressure using the boilers' primary air system.
The primary air fans of these systems will create suction from a separate high point air
intake located in the building wall above the solid waste storage pit, thus creating an air
flow path from the buildings' external openings toward the air intakes. From the air in-
takes, the air will be ducted to the fans and from the fans to the corresponding boiler. The
two independent air systems will allow the tipping bay building and the solid waste stor-
age pit to be kept under negative pressure even if one of the combustors is not operating.

In the occasional case when the two combustors are not operated, odors will be controlled
by keeping the buildings' openings closed as much as practical.


The sewage sludge building will have a separate ventilation system to create a negative
pressure within the area to control odors. The exhaust from the sewage sludge ventilation
system will be ducted to both of the boiler primary air supply intakes located above the
solid waste hoppers. Thus, the exhaust will handle odor control even when one combus-
tor is out of service. In addition, a second and separate ventilation system, that will in-
clude a carbon filter, will be installed to take suction from the sewage sludge building and
exhaust to the atmosphere. This system would be used in the occasional occurrence when
both combustors are down. It is intended that the overhead doors in the sewage sludge
building will be kept closed as much as practical, except for the ingress and egress of de-
livery vehicles.


4.7        FIRE PROTECTION
The fire protection systems, interior sprinkler systems, exterior fire mains, equipment,
and installations will be governed by the applicable sections of the following regulations,
codes or standards:
             ·          State and local codes, where existing or insurance underwriter's require-
                        ments.
             ·          National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards.
             ·          Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA).
             ·          Underwriters' Laboratories Fire Protection Equipment List and Factory Mu-
                        tual Approval Guide.
             ·          National Board of Fire Underwriters.
             ·          Factory Mutual loss prevention requirements.


The source of firewater will be the Frederick County water system. The maximum water
demand and pressure demand will be calculated for FCCRWTE; this will determine the
size of the supply pipeline within the Facility. A normal service electric motor-driven
firewater booster pump and an emergency firewater pump diesel engine will be used to


Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-54            Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
maintain system pressure. Figure 3-3 provides the location of the emergency firewater
pump diesel engine.


The system will meet or exceed the requirements of NFPA, International Building Code,
Factory Mutual, and state of Maryland codes. Rated firewalls will be provided throughout
the plant as required by applicable codes.


4.7.1            EXTERIOR FIRE PROTECTION
An underground fire loop will be installed around the plant that will include hydrants
spaced at maximum 300-ft intervals. The loop will consist of an underground pipe sized
as required with laterals to various sprinkler areas, post indicator valves, sectional control
valves, and fire hydrants with a fully equipped fire hose house at each hydrant.


4.7.2            INTERIOR FIRE PROTECTION
Fire protection will be provided, as required, for the following structures:
             ·          Tipping Bay Building Floor Area--An automatic sprinkler system extend-
                        ing out from the solid waste storage pit wall will be installed in the tipping
                        floor area. Sprinkler density will be designed for 0.25 gallon per minute per
                        square foot (gpm/ft2) over the most remote 3,000 square feet (ft2) of floor
                        area. Hose stations will be located around the perimeter of the tipping bay
                        building.
             ·          Solid Waste Storage Pit--A preaction sprinkler system will be installed at
                        the roof over the solid waste storage pit area. The preaction sprinkler system
                        will have a density of 0.32 gpm/ft2 over the most remote 4,000 ft2 of
                        pit/floor area. An electric rate-of-rise detection system will actuate the
                        preaction valve. Manually operated water cannons will be located on the
                        charging floor around the solid waste storage pit area. Hose stations will be
                        located near the charging openings.
             ·          Turbine/Generator--Sprinklers will be provided to protect the turbine bear-
                        ings, oil reservoir, lubrication oil piping, hydrogen seal unit, and hydrogen
                        cylinders if located nearby. Hose stations will be located nearby.



Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-55               Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
             ·          Boiler Building--Small hose stations will be installed at various levels of
                        the boiler building. Sprinkler protection will be provided in areas where
                        flammable hydraulic oil is stored and other areas, as required.
             ·          Cooling Tower--The cooling tower will be protected with an applicable and
                        appropriate fire protection system.
             ·          Control Room and Crane Pulpit--The control room will be provided with an
                        FM-200® fire protection system with smoke detectors. This system will be
                        installed in the raised floor cable spreading room area. The ceiling of the
                        control room and crane pulpit will be provided with a double-interlock
                        preaction system with smoke detectors and quick response automatic sprin-
                        klers.
             ·          Electrical Room--The electrical room will be provided with smoke detec-
                        tors.
             ·          Administration Building--Portable (hand) fire extinguishers and a sprinkler
                        system will be installed in the administration building.


4.8        EXPLOSION CONTROL
In the unlikely event that gas containers (propane tanks) or explosives are delivered with
the solid waste, explosion events could be created in the combustor. To minimize the
chance of such events, the tipping bay operators, as well as the crane operators, will be
trained in the checking and detecting such items in the delivered solid waste and in its
removal for safe disposal. If these find their way into the combustor, any resulting explo-
sion will be absorbed in the large combustion volume.


4.9        LIQUID CONTROL
Diesel fuel will be delivered by truck and stored within FCCRWTE in an outdoor,
aboveground, steel tank encased in a concrete vault. The fuel stored in this tank will only
be used to fuel vehicles that are operated onsite (e.g., maintenance trucks, front-end load-
ers, forklifts, etc.). The preliminary nominal capacity of the tank is 2,000 gallons. The
tank's concrete encasement, with an interstitial leak detection/monitoring system, pro-
vides continuous leak detection monitoring of the primary inner steel shell. The fuel stor-

age tank will be located within a curbed area to contain accidental spills during tank fill-
ing operation and maintenance.


Liquid chemicals, except for ammonia, will be stored indoors. For spill and leak control,
liquid chemicals, except for ammonia, will be stored within curbed areas with no floor
drains. The curbed areas will be of such size to contain 110 percent of the volume of the
largest storage tank within the area in case of rupture of such tank. Alternatively, some
chemicals may be stored in double-walled tanks. In those cases, the volume of the curbed
areas does not have to account for the volume of such tanks.


Aqueous ammonia (19-percent solution) will be stored outdoors under a roof canopy in a
steel tank with a preliminary nominal capacity of 10,000 gallons. The tank will be located
inside a concrete containment area with a minimum volume equal to 110 percent the ca-
pacity of the ammonia tank, plus 6 inches minimum of free board. The containment area
will be provided with a sloping roof extending beyond the containment area to minimize
the rain water collected. The containment area will be furnished with a manually operated
sump pump and drain, which will be maintained closed. In case of a spill or leak, the con-
tents will be removed by the operator for safe disposal outside FCCRWTE. Rainwater
collected in the containment area will be inspected by the operator and, if found to be
clean, will be manually drained by opening the drain valve for forwarding to the
wastewater storage tank.


The aqueous ammonia will be delivered to FCCRWTE by trucks, which will use the
ammonia delivery station designed for such purpose. The delivery station will have a
curbed area to contain any accidental spill. The curbed area will have an open drain con-
nected to the ammonia containment area, which will have its floor located lower than the
delivery station.


4.10 NOISE CONTROL
Noise generated by FCCRWTE will be controlled by integrating noise controls into the
design of the system and the structures within which key pieces of equipment are housed.
Noise control considerations include:

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-57    Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\ENGRPT.DOCX--061212
             ·          Silencers on the ID fans.
             ·          Ducted air intakes and silencers for the forced draft and distributor air fans.
             ·          Acoustical lagging treatment for the induced draft fan ductwork.
             ·          Acoustical lagging for the generator.
             ·          Silencers for the boiler safety valves and steam vents.
             ·          Silencers for dust collector fan discharges.
             ·          Silencers for other vents and fans.
             ·          Tipping and unloading activities located indoors.


It is expected that incorporation of these noise control features into the design of
FCCRWTE will result in a minimal contribution of operational noise to the surrounding
areas.


4.11 SANITARY FACILITIES
Sanitary facilities will be provided, as required, in the various areas of FCCRWTE. Sepa-
rate facilities will be provided for men and women in selected areas. Number of fixtures
provided will be commensurate with anticipated usage in the area.


At a minimum, sanitary facilities will be provided adjacent to the visitors/ reception area,
conference room(s), office areas, control room, and in the locker room.


In addition, locker room traffic flow will be arranged in a manner that employees will
pass through a clean area at the start of the shift, go to a changing area, and then enter the
Facility through the dirty area. At the end of the shift, they will enter the dirty area, dis-
card the clothing in laundry bins, shower, change, and exit through the clean area.


A separate facility will be provided adjacent to the ash and metal recovery building for
use by truck drivers, truck scale personnel, and personnel working in the ash and metal
recovery building.

4.12 EMERGENCY SHOWER AND EYEWASH STATIONS
Emergency shower and eyewash stations will be located in the vicinity of those areas
where chemicals or other substances that can have a harmful effect on plant personnel are
stored. Preliminarily, the locations and number of stations are as follows:
             ·          Water treatment building = 2.
             ·          Battery room = 1.
             ·          Boiler chemical injection area = 2.
             ·          Ammonia storage/unloading area = 3.
             ·          SCR ammonia injection area = 2.


The station locations and numbers be finalized in detailed design and will comply with
the requirements of American National Standards Institute No. Z358.1-2009 for Emer-
gency Eyewashes and Shower Equipment.


4.13 PLANT ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS
FCCRWTE's electric power will be supplied from the 13.8-kilovolt (kV) generator
through six transformers used to step down the voltage for distribution. The 13.8-kV
metal-clad switchgear will be constructed for indoor service and suitable for use on a
13.8-kV, three-phase, three-wire, 60-hertz system. A 4.16-kV plant system will be pro-
vided to support large motor loads and will be fed from the 13.8-kV system via step-
down transformers. A 480-volt plant distribution system will be provided to serve motors
below 250 horsepower, lighting and building services, and miscellaneous non-motor
loads


4.14 COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS
In addition to landline telephones, an intra-plant paging system will be installed (a Gai-
Tronics-type system or equal) in various areas of FCCRWTE, with receivers located in
strategic locations throughout the plant. Facility offices and the control room will be
wired for high-speed Internet access. Two-way radios will be used extensively through-
out the operation across all departments in the course of daily operations.

4.14.1 PROCESS CONTROL, INSTRUMENTATION, AND DATA LOGS
A detailed description of the process control and instrumentation for FCCRWTE will be
available when the Facility is operational.


4.14.2 COMPUTER DATA LOGS
Computer data logs will be captured and maintained. FCCRWTE will use sophisticated,
computerized tracking systems to capture operating data of the critical equipment and
systems. This data will be used for trending, analysis, maintenance planning, and to en-
sure that required reports (whether required by permit, facility operating contract, OSHA,
regulatory agencies, etc.) are prepared and submitted in a timely manner.


A state-of-the-art plant data logging system will be provided that will log and record a
multitude of plant parameters on a regular, timed basis. The data logger will be config-
ured to support the permits, monitoring requirements, and preferences.


4.15 MAJOR ITEMS OF EQUIPMENT
Table 4-2 identifies FCCRWTE's typical major items of equipment including manufac-
turer, type, model, capacity, and number of units. This equipment list should be consid-
ered preliminary as final design has not been completed. Equipment manufacturers are
for illustration purposes only. Equivalent equipment may be selected as part of the final
engineering design.

                                                          1.0 INTRODUCTION


1.1        PURPOSE
The purpose of this final draft materials separation plan (MSP) is to identify the goals and
approaches for separating certain components of the municipal solid waste (MSW)
stream in the Frederick and Carroll Counties' (the Counties') service areas in order to
make the separated materials available for recycling. The nonrecycled Acceptable Ma-
terial will be processed at the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority's (NEA's)
Frederick/Carroll County Renewable Waste-to-Energy Facility (FCCRWTE or the Facili-
ty). FCCRWTE will also accept tires under a scrap tire acceptance permit and sewage
sludge under a sewage sludge utilization permit. Both Counties have contractually desig-
nated FCCRWTE as the central solid waste acceptance facility for the disposal of nonre-
cycled Acceptable Material generated in their respective county.


This final draft MSP fulfills one of the requirements of Title 40 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR), Part 60, Subpart Eb, New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for
FCCRWTE.


The standard also prescribes a specific process that must be followed to ensure the oppor-
tunity for public review and comment on the draft MSP. The process consists of the fol-
lowing:
             ·          Preparation and issuance of a preliminary draft MSP for public comment.
             ·          Notification of a public meeting for accepting oral and written comments on
                        the preliminary draft MSP.
             ·          Acceptance of written comments on the preliminary draft MSP.
             ·          Preparation of written responses to any public comments.
             ·          Identification of the location(s) where written responses to public comment
                        on the preliminary draft MSP will be available for inspection.
             ·          Preparation of a final draft MSP, considering the public comments
             ·          Submission of the following to the Maryland Department of the Environ-
                        ment (MDE) as part of the facility's application for a construction permit:

1.2        BACKGROUND
NEA was created by the State of Maryland to assist its member jurisdictions with their
integrated solid waste needs. NEA's member jurisdictions include seven Maryland coun-
ties and the city of Baltimore. The Counties are both members of NEA and have entered
into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) by and among Frederick County, Carroll
County, and NEA for the development of a regional energy recovery facility (July 2009).
This MOU describes the site location in Frederick County; the ownership, design, and
capacity of the Facility; as well as the responsibilities of NEA, the Counties, and the
Vendor, Wheelabrator Technologies, Inc. (WTI).


WTI has entered into a service contract with NEA for the design, construction, and opera-
tion of a 1,500-tons-per-day (tpd) nominal regional waste-to-energy (WTE) facility in
Frederick County, Maryland. The Facility will serve the long-term solid waste disposal
needs of Frederick and Carroll Counties, as well as produce for sale approximately
45 megawatts of electricity to meet the Counties' governmental energy needs.
FCCRWTE will be owned by NEA.


Each county in Maryland is required to have a county solid waste management plan
(SWMP) in accordance with the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR),
Title 26.03.03. Both Counties have approved SWMPs. Carroll County's most recent
SWMP (Carroll County, Maryland 10-Year Solid Waste Management Plan 2002 ­ 2012
[Updated 2006]) was approved by MDE in 2007. Frederick County's most recent SWMP
(Frederick County, Maryland Division of Utilities and Solid Waste Management Solid
Waste Management Plan 1998 ­ 2017) was revised and approved by the Frederick Coun-
ty Board of County Commissioners in 2010 and conditionally approved by MDE in 2011.

This final draft MSP has been prepared to satisfy the federal air permit application re-
quirements (40 CFR 60.57b). NEA is acting on behalf of the Counties in seeking the
permits for FCCRWTE and, as such, has incorporated aspects of the Counties' current
approved SWMPs and currently planned revisions in this MSP. Table 1-1 identifies spe-
cific goals of the Counties' plans.


Each of the Counties' SWMPs and recycling programs strive to reduce the amount of ma-
terials entering the MSW stream, thus reducing the amount of wastes needing to be trans-
ported either out of state for disposal or to a local landfill. In general, the recognized ben-
efits of reducing the MSW stream through recycling include a reduction in transportation
costs, a reduction in the amount of disposal fees to the citizens due to reduced volumes,
and an increase in the longevity of the life of the local landfills. Most importantly, by ac-
tively supporting recycling efforts, the Counties and NEA are preserving valuable re-
sources. In addition, the SWMPs act as guidance documents to assure that the Counties
meet and exceed the state of Maryland's mandatory 20-percent recycling goal for each
county and the voluntary statewide waste diversion goal of 40 percent (Annotated Code
of Maryland, Env. Art. §9-1705).


NEA, through its contractor WTI, will achieve additional recycling at FCCRWTE with
the recovery of recyclable metals (ferrous and nonferrous) from the waste stream both
before and after processing. Large bulky metal items will be recovered on the tipping
floor, while other metals will be collected in FCCRWTE's ferrous and nonferrous metal
recovery systems. Recovered metals will be recycled.


The Counties' recycling programs will not compete with FCCRWTE for solid waste. On-
ly solid waste that is not recycled will be used for conversion into energy at FCCRWTE.
It has been shown that communities nationwide using WTE programs have an aggregate
recycling rate at least 5 percentage points above the national average (Recycling and
Waste-to-Energy, Are They Compatible? 2009 Update Governmental Advisory Asso-
ciates, Inc., Eileen Brettler Berenyi June 2009). This is true in Maryland as Baltimore,
Harford, and Montgomery Counties have some of the highest MDE waste diversion rates
(MDE 2009 data: 42.94, 62.03, and 47.04 percent, respectively).

                                   2.0 SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


2.1        SERVICE AREAS
The primary service areas for the MSP described in this document include residential,
business, industrial, institutional, and commercial waste generators of Frederick and Car-
roll Counties, Maryland. FCCRWTE has been sized to meet the needs of the Counties
over the planned life of the facility and, therefore, is sized to accommodate growth. Addi-
tional waste from outside the primary service area must be accepted to enable
FCCRWTE to operate at its designed capacity. NEA will allow Acceptable Waste from
outside the Counties' service area upon written direction from both Counties.


2.2        FACILITIES AND COMPONENTS
2.2.1         FREDERICK COUNTY
2.2.1.1 Collection
The city of Frederick provides collection of MSW using municipal employees and
equipment. The remainder of the incorporated municipalities contract directly with pri-
vate haulers.


Citizens not living within an incorporated area of Frederick County may have the collec-
tion of MSW provided by their home owners association via contract (if applicable), are
free to contract with a private hauler, or may take their waste directly to the Reichs Ford
Road Landfill (see Table 2-1).


Commercial and institutional establishments in unincorporated areas of Frederick County
and certain incorporated portions of the County may also contract directly with private
haulers or self-haul directly to the landfill.


2.2.1.2 Collection Agreements
Frederick County entered into an agreement with BFI Waste Services, LLC, designating
them as Frederick County's private hauler for the residential single-stream recyclable
program.

2.2.1.3 Recycling Drop-Off Facilities
Only County residents may use any of the 11 recycling drop-off locations in Frederick
County for single-stream recycling. Schools, businesses, churches, organized groups, or
commercial entities must contract with a solid waste management contractor for recy-
cling services. The locations of the recycling drop-off facilities are:
             ·          214 13th Avenue, Brunswick.
             ·          3612 Buckeystown Pike, Buckeystown.
             ·          1200 North East Street, Frederick.
             ·          1820 Rosemount Avenue, Frederick.
             ·          9031 Reichs Ford Road, Frederick (also a landfill).
             ·          4606 Lander Road, Jefferson.
             ·          7628 Coblentz Road, Middletown.
             ·          8098 Crum Road, Mt. Pleasant.

             ·          3604 Urbana Pike, Frederick.
             ·          8948 Indian Springs Road, Frederick.


In addition to residential single-stream recycling collection, the Reichs Ford Road Facili-
ty accepts commercial single-stream recycling, bulky/oversized rigid plastic items, tex-
tiles, scrap metal, motor oil, flexible foam, white goods, lead acid batteries, antifreeze,
tires, and electronics. Residential and commercial single-stream recyclables are sent to
the Recycle America Material Recovery Facility (MRF) in Elkridge, Maryland.


Unbagged or paper bagged (only) leaves, grass clippings, brush trimmings, and limbs (no
longer than 8 feet [ft] long and 6 inches in diameter) can be left by residents at two Coun-
ty locations: Reichs Ford Road Yard Trimmings/Mulch and Compost Site and Walkers-
ville Heritage Farm Park (drop-off only). There is currently no cost to drop off these ma-
terials. This program currently produces two grades of mulch: premium double-ground
and basic single-ground. The program also produces a finished, screened compost prod-
uct. These products are for sale in bulk at the Reichs Ford Road facility.

2.2.1.4 Transfer Stations
Frederick County currently has in operation an MSW transfer facility capable of accept-
ing solid waste at no more than 720,000 tons per year (tpy) of MSW. The transfer station
is located at the Reichs Ford Road Landfill site. The transfer facility provides benefits of
an integrated solid waste management program by providing the following:
             ·          Extension of the life of Reichs Ford Road Landfill by transporting MSW to
                        out-of-county disposal facilities.
             ·          Long-term options for recycling and/or managing nonprocessible waste.
             ·          Convenient residential and commercial single-stream recyclables process-
                        sing/transfer to contract MRFs.


Upon construction of FCCRWTE, the transfer station may be used to transfer incoming

According to the 2010 Frederick County SWMP, there are several landfills in operation
for waste collection and disposal purposes in Frederick County:
             ·          The Reichs Ford Road Sanitary Landfill, Site B, is a 58-acre sanitary landfill
                        located on 183 acres approximately 4 miles east of the city of Frederick.
                        This landfill is owned by Frederick County and accepts wastes from residen-
                        tial, business, commercial, and institutional entities.
             ·          The Fort Detrick Landfill is a sanitary landfill located on 61 acres of land in
                        the northwest corner of the city of Frederick and owned by the U.S. Army.
                        This landfill accepts U.S. Army bypass (unburnable) waste and incinerator
                        ash.
             ·          The Eastalco facility is a private 10-acre industrial waste landfill located in
                        the southern part of Frederick County and owned by Eastalco Aluminum
                        Company, Inc. This facility accepts Eastalco potliner brick and pollution
                        control device debris wastes. Operations were curtailed in December 2005.
                        Eastalco has a MDE solid waste disposal permit that expires in October
                        2014.

             ·          The Eyler Land Clearing Debris Landfill is a 14-acre rubblefill located in
                        northeastern Frederick County and owned by John C. Eyler. This landfill
                        accepts land-clearing debris only.


2.2.2         CARROLL COUNTY
2.2.2.1 Collection
Businesses and residents in unincorporated areas of Carroll County can either self-haul
their waste and recyclables to the Northern Landfill and Recycling Center or Hoods Mill
Landfill convenience center or contract for the services directly with any hauler licensed
by Carroll County. Under the licensing requirements, each hauler is required to offer col-
lection for all County-approved recyclables. Seven of the incorporated municipalities
provide waste and recycling services for their residents through contractors. Sykesville
provides collection of MSW and recyclables using municipal employees and equipment.
(see Table 2-2).


2.2.2.2 Collection Agreements
Although no formal agreements exist between any one hauler and Carroll County, haulers
used within the seven municipalities and/or unincorporated portions of Carroll County
must secure a license from Carroll County and operate under the requirements of the Car-
roll County Solid Waste Ordinance (Chapter 185 Solid Waste).


2.2.2.3 Recycling Drop-Off Facilities
Businesses and residents may use both of the recycling drop-off facilities located at Car-
roll County's two landfill sites. The landfill sites accept single-stream recycling items in
addition to bulky/oversized items, textiles, scrap metal, automotive materials, motor oil,
antifreeze, tires, and electronics. The locations of the recycling drop-off facilities are:
             ·          1400 Baltimore Boulevard, Westminster (Northern Landfill).
             ·          7901 Kabik Court, Woodbine (Hoods Mill Landfill).


The Recycling Center, located at the Northern Landfill, accepts materials recycled
through the Carroll County's curbside program (Acceptable Recyclable Materials) plus
textiles, rigid plastics, grocery and empty clear food bags, CD/DVD cases and disks, car

and truck batteries, used motor oil, antifreeze, vinyl siding, used frying oil, and kitchen
grease. Aluminum can reimbursement is offered during certain times. Reimbursement
rates fluctuate with the aluminum market value.


The Northern Landfill also accepts for recycling white goods/scrap metal and electronics
and has a waste exchange program through The Northern Landfill Swap Shop.


Separated yard trimmings are accepted at the yard waste area at Carroll County Landfills.
The wood trimmings, grass, and leaves are mulched. The mulch is available to Carroll
County residents at no charge.


Recycled Green Industries, LLC (Recycled Green), leases a parcel of the Hoods Mill
Landfill for the operation of a compost/soil amendment program. The program operates
by receiving food and yard waste material (generated both in and out of Carroll County),
treating it, mixing it with soil, and selling it in bulk. In 2009, Recycled Green accepted a
reported 34,000 tons of yard waste material.


2.2.2.4 Material Recovery Facility
A MRF began operation adjacent to the transfer station at the Northern Landfill in 1999.
The MRF has a permitted capacity of 61,000 tpy of commingled recyclables (residential
and commercial), although it has historically processed approximately 14,000 tpy. Con-
tainers (glass, plastic, and cans) are reloaded and sent to another facility outside Carroll
County for further processing. Old corrugated cardboard and mixed paper are baled and
sent to markets. The MRF is a County-owned facility; however, the operation, transfer,
and processing are contracted through a private operator.


2.2.2.5 Transfer Stations
Carroll County currently has in operation an MSW transfer facility located at the North-
ern Landfill site with a permitted capacity of 305,000 tpy of MSW. It has historically
transferred between 66,000 and 104,000 tpy of MSW to landfills in Virginia and Penn-
sylvania.



Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   2-7        Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP.DOCX--020711
The transfer facility provides benefits of an integrated solid waste management program
by providing the following:
             ·          Extension of the life of Northern Landfill by transporting MSW to out-of-
                        county disposal facilities.
             ·          Long-term options for recycling and/or managing nonprocessible waste.
             ·          Convenient residential and commercial single-stream recyclables process-
                        sing/transfer to contract MRFs.


Upon construction of FCCRWTE, the transfer station may be used to transfer incoming
MSW to the Facility for processing


Roll-Off Express is a privately owned and operated waste processing facility on Dede
Road in Finksburg that is open to the public and contractors. Roll-Off Express recycles
wood, cardboard, metal, and concrete. Residuals are disposed of in properly permitted
solid waste facilities outside of Carroll County.


2.2.2.6 Landfills
According to the Carroll County 10-Year Solid Waste Management Plan 2002 - 2012
(Updated 2006), Carroll County currently has one landfill, the Northern Landfill, in oper-
ation for waste collection and disposal purposes. The Northern Landfill is located on
200 acres of land and is owned by Carroll County. The facility accepts all types of resi-
dential and commercial solid wastes.


The Hoods Mill Landfill, located on 125 acres of land and also owned by Carroll County,
is no longer in operation as a landfill. This facility is now currently accepting wastes for
transfer, recycling, and yard waste for mulching. The Hoods Mill facility operates as a
noncommercial customer convenience drop-off station on Saturdays only. Waste and re-
cyclables are backhauled to Northern Landfill for processing. Carroll County also distri-
butes mulch from this site.


C. J. Miller, LLC, located on Dede Road in Finksburg, is the only construction and demo-
lition facility in Carroll County that accepts and/or processes waste for reuse or disposal.

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   2-8               Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP.DOCX--020711
The facility accepts broken concrete and old asphalt paving, which is crushed and used as
aggregate in new asphalt.


2.3        SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL AGREEMENTS
To provide economical, efficient, and environmentally responsible solid waste disposal
services, the Counties have entered into agreements with multiple companies for waste
disposal.


2.3.1         FREDERICK COUNTY
Frederick County, in cooperation with Carroll County in July of 2009, entered into an
MOU and an Energy Recovery Agreement with NEA for the development of a 1,500-tpd
WTE facility to provide long-term disposal capacity for the Counties.


Frederick County entered into an agreement with NEA to develop landfill gas processing
at the Reichs Ford Road Landfill for electricity generation in 2009.


Frederick County currently has solid waste transfer and single-stream recyclables
processing contracts through NEA. Frederick County uses two NEA contracts for the
transportation and disposal of Acceptable Material. They also use an NEA contract for
the transportation and processing of single-stream recyclables. All three contracts transfer
material from the transfer station at the Reichs Ford Road Landfill.


2.3.2         CARROLL COUNTY
Carroll County, in cooperation with Frederick County in July of 2009, entered into an
MOU and Energy Recovery Agreement with NEA for the development of a 1,500-tpd
WTE facility to provide long-term disposal capacity for the Counties.


Interstate Waste Services, Inc., currently has a contract to transfer at least 50,000 tpy of
MSW from Northern Landfill to one of three Subtitle D permitted landfills in Pennsylva-
nia.

2.4        MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE QUANTITIES AND PROJECTIONS
2.4.1         FREDERICK COUNTY
Frederick County is currently experiencing a growth in its population. Population growth
is an important part of waste management planning, because it provides a base to esti-
mate the amount of waste that will be produced based on projected population growth
and waste generation rates. The Frederick County Comprehensive Plan (April 2010)
(Figure 02-3, Historic and Projected Population [Page 02-8]) shows the 2010 population
of 235,364 growing to a projected population of 331,700 through 2030.


Waste generation projections for Frederick County were obtained from NEA's planning
model. Typically, as the population increases, so does the amount of waste generated,
even if the per capita waste generation rate plateaus and does not increase.


With the full implementation of the residential single-stream recycling program through-
out the County, in addition to planned policies and programs, Frederick County antic-
ipates the amount of waste materials separated for recycling to increase, along with the
population and amount of municipal wastes generated. Figure 2-1 depicts the Frederick
County recycling and waste tonnage projections.


2.4.2         CARROLL COUNTY
Carroll County is currently experiencing a growth in its population. Population growth is
an important part of waste management planning, because it provides a base to project an
estimate of the amount of waste that will be produced based on past populations and
waste generation rates. The Carroll County Comprehensive Plan (October 2010) (Chapter
2: Page 15) shows the 2010 population of 171,739 growing to a projected population of
203,036 through 2030.


According to the Carroll County SWMP (updated 2006), it is also anticipated that, as the
population has increased, so will the amount of wastes generated.


With the continuous implementation of the single-stream recycling program and policies
in place, in addition to future policies and programs, Carroll County anticipates the

                                           3.0 MATERIALS SEPARATION PLAN


3.1        OBJECTIVES/GOALS
The Maryland Recycling Act (MRA) (Annotated Code of Maryland, Environment Article
§ 9-1705) requires that counties with populations greater than 150,000 recycle 20 percent
of their waste. Additionally, in 2000, Maryland established a voluntary statewide waste
diversion goal of 40 percent by 2005. The waste diversion goal is comprised of the MRA
recycling rate plus source reduction credits (maximum 5 percent) that Maryland counties
earn through activities designed to reduce the amount of waste going to the waste stream.
The MRA excludes from its scope certain scrap metals, land clearing debris, construction
and demolition debris, sewage sludge, and hospital wastes. As part of the monitoring of
recycling activity, annual collection of data is gathered from businesses that recycle all or
part of their waste. Each county collects local data then submits information to MDE. Re-
cyclable materials tracked in this annual report include:
             ·          Compostables--Mixed yard waste, wood waste, and food waste.
             ·          Glass--Containers, mixed glass, and fluorescent light tubes.
             ·          Metals--Cans, scrap, and white goods.
             ·          Paper--Corrugated cardboard, mixed paper, newspaper, books, telephone
                        books, and shredded paper.
             ·          Plastic--Mixed plastics, films, and containers.
             ·          Other Materials--Laser toner cartridges, lead-acid batteries, oil filters, and
                        wood pallets.


The latest available MRA data from MDE are "County Recyclables by Commodity in
Tons for Calendar Year 2009" and can be found at http://www.mde.state.md.us/programs
/Land/RecyclingandOperationsprogram/StateCountyandCityContactInfo/Pages/programs/
landprograms/recycling/local/recylingrates.aspx; accessed January 28, 2011.


The Counties intend to meet and exceed these recycling goals with the cooperation of
their citizens, businesses, and FCCRWTE. Recycling is a crucial component of the Coun-
ties' integrated waste management systems.

3.2        FREDERICK COUNTY
3.2.1         MATERIALS SEPARATION STRATEGY
For calendar year 2009, MDE certified Frederick County's waste diversion rate
(41.63-percent MRA recycling rate and 5-percent source reduction credit) as
46.63 percent. Frederick County Commissioners have established a waste diversion goal
(material removed from the waste stream through recycling, composting, and other strat-
egies including source reduction credits) of 60 percent by the year 2025.


Frederick County's Department of Solid Waste Management February 2010 newsletter
(Volume 2, Issue 1) notes that during the first year (2009) of the Frederick County single-
stream recycling system, the residential recycling program experienced a dramatic in-
crease in not only the number of households actively participating but also in the amount
of material being collected. The program witnessed an escalation in the 37-percent set-
out rate from the old dual-stream program; set-out rates in the new single-stream program
average around 65 percent--almost doubled. (The recycling set-out rate is the percentage
of households that set-out for curbside pick-up on a particular day.) The tons of material
collected from curbside recycling increased an average of 66 percent between 2008 and
2009. Frederick County also amplified its education efforts by adding new staff to the
Office of Recycling team to create newspaper articles, public service announcements, and
residential communications (including the newsletter) throughout the year.


3.2.1.1 Education/Awareness/Outreach
Public education, awareness, and outreach are integral parts of the recycling portion of
the Frederick County SWMP. Frederick County incorporates outreach and education
elements into almost all of the different recycling programs. For example, a significant
amount of outreach is attributed to the contract curbside recycling program and therefore
assigned as a cost for that particular program and not reflected in the separate outreach
program budget.


Frederick County has a recycling outreach coordinator, a commercial recycling program
coordinator, and additional staff support (total 2.1 full time equivalents) devoted to the

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   3-2       Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP.DOCX--020711
recycling education/outreach effort. The recycling outreach program coordinator is avail-
able for answering recycling or composting questions, providing on- or offsite education-
al programs, coordinate events, and provide information on recycling and waste man-
agement practices in Frederick County. The staff provides technical assistance to busi-
nesses in establishing or expanding their existing recycling and waste reduction pro-
grams. The staff is also available to provide information on available recycling resources,
monitoring solid waste and recycling activities, waste reduction strategies, and other en-
vironmentally friendly tips.


The annual expenditures for recycling education/outreach during the 2010 fiscal year
were $218,904.


Frederick County maintains a recycling page on its county government Web site
(http://frederickcountymd.gov/index.aspx?nid=1764; accessed January 11, 2011). Four
times a year, the Frederick County Department of Solid Waste Management issues an
informative digital newsletter. This newsletter can either be viewed on the Frederick
County Web page (http://frederickcountymd.gov /index.aspx?NID=3941; accessed Janu-
ary 11, 2011) or it is available for direct e-mail upon request. The Frederick County De-
partment of Solid Waste Management also conducts direct mailing up to four times per
year to all single-family homes to provide updates and guidance on the curbside recycling
program.


A guidebook, titled A Citizens Guide to Waste Management in Frederick County, was
created to provide information on recycling and waste reduction. This booklet serves as a
resource that covers topics from waste disposal programs to maps of the facilities and
contact numbers. The booklet may either be downloaded from the Frederick County Web
site (http://frederickcountymd.gov/index.aspx?NID=4046; accessed January 11, 2011) or
requested in a printed format.


A similar guidebook, titled Mind Your Business! Guide to Integrated Waste Management
Practices for Organizations and Workplaces, was created specifically to address the
needs of businesses and organizations within Frederick County. This guidebook is avail-

According to Frederick County's Department of Solid Waste Management, Frederick
County was a recent recipient of a grant from The Curbside Value Partnership (CVP), a
program of Keep America Beautiful, Inc. CVP selected three communities nationwide to
work with that have strong existing curbside recycling programs, the means to measure
the effectiveness of those programs, and a desire to "think outside the box" when it
comes to educating their residents about recycling. The "Learn More, Recycle Better"
campaign officially kicked off on September 16, 2010, with discussion of campaign de-
tails and plans for a countywide education blitz that will include billboards, radio, cine-
ma, and print advertisements; direct homeowner outreach; and a new Web site
(http://www.LearnMoreRecycleBetter.org).


3.2.1.2 Waste Generation Prevention/Reduction
Frederick County encourages waste generation prevention and source reduction as an
integral part of their waste management and recycling plan. The County has a multifa-
ceted waste reduction program using advertising, educational, and informative programs
and techniques. They also offer assistance to both commercial and residential entities
providing education and practical applications.


To encourage local business owners to create less waste, Frederick County, in coopera-
tion with other local agencies and organizations, created a new awards program to recog-
nize the innovative steps that forward-thinking local businesses are taking to create less
waste. Participating businesses compete by using waste prevention and source reduction
techniques for the annual Frederick County Source Reduction Award. This program en-
courages businesses to incorporate waste prevention and source reduction policies in the
workplace.

3.2.2         MATERIALS SEPARATION PROGRAMS
3.2.2.1 Single-Stream Recycling
Frederick County has incorporated single-stream recycling as part of their recycling pro-
gram. Because no separation of materials is necessary, single-stream recycling is easier
and more appealing than traditional curbside recycling programs that require items to be
placed in separate bins. Single-stream recycling is a service provided to single-family
homes in Frederick County through curbside service at a cost of approximately
$4,033,000 (2010 fiscal year). The Department of Solid Waste Management has com-
pleted some preliminary work on a 6-month multifamily recycling pilot program for
apartments and condominiums in Frederick County. This draft pilot program has not been
finalized and is not likely to be implemented until fiscal year 2012.


In addition, the single-stream recycling approach applies to recycling drop-off facilities in
Frederick County. Single-stream recycling for commercial and industrial facilities is pro-
vided on a case-by-case basis by their respective contracted hauler.


The following items are accepted in Frederick County's single-stream recycling program

If there is a new material added by the single-stream recycling vendor, Frederick County
will add that material to the list of accepted items for curbside recycling.


Business Recycling
In Frederick County, businesses, institutions, and industries account for nearly 50 percent
of Frederick County's MSW; therefore, it is important that these facilities incorporate
aspects of Frederick County's SWMP into their business. To ensure that companies assist
in meeting the recycling goal, Frederick County recommends that businesses, institutions,
and industries work together with the County and the Chamber of Commerce to continue
to track recycling progress and provide literature, forums, and programs on business re-
cycling.


The city of Frederick in 2010 began offering free recycling services to commercial busi-
nesses located within a pilot project area. The pilot project area coincides with those
downtown streets that currently receive six-night-a-week trash service from the city of
Frederick.

While the Frederick County Department of Solid Waste Management does not provide
recycling collection services for businesses or commercial properties in Frederick Coun-
ty, it does offer a financial incentive for those businesses that choose to recycle. There is
a tipping fee differential to encourage commercial properties to recycle single-stream; the
base tipping fee for municipal solid waste is $76, while the fee for 1 ton of single-stream
recycling is $25.


The Department of Solid Waste Management also has a commercial recycling program
coordinator to assist businesses in establishing or expanding existing recycling and waste
reduction programs. The program coordinator provides general overall support for recy-
cling program implementation through assisting with waste audits, training employees
and custodial staff, providing public presentations for meetings and trainings, providing
reproducible literature on recycling and waste reduction, providing templates for creating
posters and newsletter information, sharing a database of service contacts and networking
information, and providing a step-by-step guide to integrated waste management practic-
es to reduce waste in the workplace.


3.2.2.2 Additional Recyclable Programs
Additional recyclable materials are accepted at the Reichs Ford Road Landfill. These in-
clude:
             ·          Bulky/Oversized Rigid Plastics--Lawn furniture, toys (such as outdoor play
                        sets), coolers, kiddie pools, plastic buckets, tubs and storage totes, plastic

             ·          Lead Acid Batteries


3.2.2.3 Yard Waste Composting
Ordinance No. 06-03-399 enacted on January 17, 2006, by Frederick County banned
landfill disposal of yard waste from both residential and commercial entities. Residents
and businesses are encouraged to dispose of and/or recycle yard waste at home using
grasscycling and backyard composting practices. Curbside yard waste collection is often
available to single-family residences in Frederick County by their contracted MSW hau-
ler.


There are two county-operated facilities currently in operation in Frederick County where
yard waste may be taken for composting or mulching: Walkersville Heritage Farm Park
(residential use only) and Reichs Ford Road Mulch and Composting Facility (residential
and commercial). Mulch generated as part of the yard waste acceptance and composting
operations are available for free at the Walkersville Farm Park and for a fee at the Reichs
Ford Road Facility. Compost products are available at the Reichs Ford landfill for a fee.


3.2.2.4 Household Hazardous Waste
Household hazardous wastes (HHWs) are not accepted as part of the Frederick County
recycling program. The Division of Utilities and Solid Waste Management (DUSWM)
typically hosts two residential HHW drop-off events per year to collect HHWs that resi-
dents may accumulate.


In 2008 and 2009, the HHW contractor recycled 780 and 1,113 pounds, respectively of
the HHW collected. Recycled materials included batteries, mercury and mercury-
containing items, fluorescent light tubes, and bulbs.

3.2.2.5 Waste Oils/Antifreeze
Frederick County, in cooperation with the Maryland Environmental Service (MES), as
well as with local municipalities and businesses, offers several motor oil and antifreeze
recycling locations for County residents in addition to the Reichs Ford Road Landfill.
County facilities have a limit of 15 gallons per resident per trip. A number of these loca-
tions are not affiliated with Frederick County but offer these services as a convenience
for the public (see http://www.menv.com/usedoilcollectionlocations.shtml [accessed Jan-
uary 11, 2011] for used motor oil and antifreeze collection centers).


In 2008 and 2009 Frederick County residents recycled 48,214 and 57,806 gallons of oil
and 3,307 and 4,228 gallons of antifreeze, respectively.


3.2.2.6 Tires
The disposal of scrap tires has been banned in Maryland landfills since 1994. Tires are
accepted for recycling and disposal at the Reichs Ford Road Landfill Facility for a fee of
$3.80 per 100 pounds for residential (limit 5 annually) and $8.00 per 100 pounds for
commercial.


DUSWM has a scrap tire disposal policy that includes specific requirements for segrega-
tion, delivery, and disposal of tires. Conformance with this policy ensures compliance
with the DUSWM's Solid Waste Disposal Permit and Secondary Scrap Tire Collection
Facility License (2008-RSC-00280).


In 2008 and 2009 5,097 and 4,445 tires, respectively, were recycled as part of this pro-
gram.


Upon completion of construction of FCCRWTE, scrap tires delivered to landfills or other
permitted scrap tire facilities may be transported to the Facility to process for energy and
metals recovery.

3.2.2.7 Electronics
Electronics are accepted at the Reichs Ford Road Landfill for a fee for every 100 pounds
of electronics. Acceptable electronic items include laptops, computer monitors/mice, cel-
lular telephones, circuit boards, power supplies, computer batteries, computer/electronics
cables, computer chips/cards, printers, central processing unit (CPU) towers, scanners,
televisions and keyboards.


3.2.2.8 Scrap Metals/Recyclable White Goods/Ash Recovery
Scrap metal/recyclable white goods are accepted at the Reichs Ford Road Landfill. Ac-
ceptable scrap metal and recyclable white goods items include metal shelving, cabinets,
bicycles, fencing, lawn mowers, wire coat hangers, grills, swing sets, aluminum lawn
chairs, appliances, etc.


When FCCRWTE becomes operational, Acceptable Material will be brought to the Facil-
ity where they will be processed. Following combustion, bottom ash will be passed
through a screen to separate large metal materials; a magnetic separator will remove addi-
tional ferrous metals. An eddy current separator will remove nonferrous metals. Metals
recovered at FCCRWTE will be recycled contractually.


A percentage of ash recovered from FCCRWTE will be taken to the Reichs Ford Road
Landfill, where it will be used as daily cover in place of soil materials from other sources.
NEA, in cooperation with Frederick County, will investigate other ash recycling options.


3.3        CARROLL COUNTY
3.3.1         MATERIALS SEPARATION STRATEGY
The vision of the Carroll County recycling operation is to encourage a culture of waste
reduction, reuse, and recycling. The County's goal is to recommend and facilitate pro-
grams; educate students, residents, and businesses to minimize the waste stream; and
maximize the recovery of valuable and useful materials.


For calendar year 2009, MDE certified Carroll County's waste diversion rate
(38.05-percent MRA recycling rate and 4-percent source reduction credit) as

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   3-10        Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP.DOCX--020711
42.05 percent. Carroll County Board of Commissioners have established a waste diver-
sion goal (materials removed from the waste stream through recycling, composting, and
other strategies) of 40-percent recycling and a 5-percent source reduction credit by 2015.


3.3.2         EDUCATION/AWARENESS/OUTREACH
Carroll County recognizes the importance of public education, awareness, and outreach
as part of the recycling portion of the Carroll County SWMP. Carroll County has one
employee (recycling manager) devoted full time to the recycling effort and part-time ad-
ministrative support. The annual budget for recycling during the 2010 fiscal year was
$274,300. The recycling manager participates in many educational opportunities and has
an array of volunteers that include the Master Gardeners' Association, school groups, and
environmental activists.


Carroll County maintains a recycling page on its county government Web site
(http://ccgovernment.carr.org/ccg/recycle/default.asp; accessed January 11, 2011). The
Carroll County Office of Recycling has a Facebook page to inform the public of events
and activities of their program.


The Carroll County Board of Commissioners established the Carroll County Environ-
mental Advisory Council (EAC) in 2003 to provide for public input with regard to envi-
ronmental concerns. The focus of the EAC has been to provide information on issues of
environmental concerns (i.e., solid waste management) to the citizens of Carroll County.
The existence of the EAC also serves at an outreach to the community; providing the op-
portunity for citizens to be involved in, question, and comment on the environmental
processes of Carroll County. The EAC made recommendations to the Carroll County
Board of Commissioners on addressing solid waste in Carroll County in October of 2007
(http://ccgovernment.carr.org/ccg/eac/recommend.pdf; accessed January 11, 2011).


Carroll County has produced a video promoting waste prevention, reuse, and recycling,
which is available at County libraries. The video is also widely used by County personnel
during recycling presentations.



Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   3-11      Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP.DOCX--020711
Carroll County has provided a mail-out of their Waste Management and Recycling
Handbook, which incorporates the waste management hierarchy and summarizes County
waste management programs.


3.3.3         WASTE PREVENTION/REDUCTION
Carroll County regards waste prevention and reduction as one of its main objectives in its
SWMP. Carroll County anticipates implementing waste reduction throughout the County
using a combination of internal policies and citizen education programs. The County uses
the following techniques and procedures in an effort to meet its waste prevention and re-
duction goals:
             ·          Make a waste reduction education and information package available for
                        public and private use.
             ·          Provide waste reduction information and tips on the Carroll County Web
                        site.
             ·          Include a segment on waste management as part of all presentations of waste
                        management given within Carroll County.
             ·          Provide technical assistance to homeowners and small businesses on the
                        subject of waste reduction.
             ·          Provide technical assistance to municipal governments, schools, and quasi-
                        public institutions assisting them in implementing local waste reduction
                        programs.
             ·          Provide technical assistance to homeowners and residential developers pro-
                        moting and assisting in the implementation of composing and mulching pro-
                        grams.
             ·          Implement in-house purchasing procedures that encourage the purchase of
                        materials that have a reuse value and the purchase of materials made from
                        recycled material.

3.3.4         MATERIALS SEPARATION PROGRAMS
3.3.4.1 Single-Stream Recycling
The single-stream recycling approach has been generally accepted countywide and is
used by nearly all residential and commercial entities of Carroll County. Single-stream
recyclables can be recycled through curbside pickup or brought to one of the two desig-
nated recycling facilities in Carroll County.


The following items are accepted in Carroll County's single-stream recycling program
(Carroll           County             Single-Stream       Recycling   Program   Acceptable     Items;       http://

                        o          Computer printouts.


If there is a new material added by the single-stream recycling vendors, Carroll County
will add that material to the list of acceptable recycling materials.


Curbside Recycling
Curbside recycling is available to residents and businesses of Carroll County through
County-licensed and approved haulers. Single-stream recycling is collected from all
County and school facilities. Seven of the eight incorporated municipalities of Carroll
County provide residential curbside recycling through contracted haulers selected
through a specific municipal bid process. Sykesville operates its own MSW collection
and recycling program using municipal employees and equipment.


Business Recycling
Businesses and industries in Carroll County account for approximately 50 percent of the
County's waste stream. Business and industry in Carroll County rely on either private
waste management companies that offer full-service hauling and disposal or commercial
haulers and government disposal facilities. Carroll County does not provide services re-
lated to collection of recyclables from businesses.


3.3.4.2 Additional Recyclable Programs
Additional recyclable materials are accepted at the Northern and Hoods Mill Landfill:
             ·          Car batteries.
             ·          Concrete/asphalt pieces smaller than 6 inches in diameter.
             ·          Fluorescent bulbs and tubes (must be wrapped in paper and placed in a plas-
                        tic bag).
             ·          Latex paint cans (residual paint must be hardened or dry).

             ·          Rigid plastic, grocery and empty clear food bags, DVD/CD cases and disks.
             ·          Appliances: white goods such as scrap metal, washers, dryers, hot water
                        heaters, etc. (Not accepted: freezers, refrigerators, and air conditioners.)


Additional recyclable materials are accepted only at the Northern Landfill:
             ·          Appliances: white goods such as freezers, refrigerators, and air condition-
                        ers.

                        paired shoes and socks, etc.
             ·          Aluminum beverage cans.


3.3.4.3 Yard Waste Mulching
In May of 1994, Carroll County banned yard trimmings from both residential and com-
mercial entities from being landfilled. Residents and businesses are encouraged to dis-
pose of and/or recycle yard waste at home using grasscycling and backyard composting
practices. The eight incorporated municipalities of Carroll County provide residences
with drop-off sites and curbside collection through their licensed and contracted haulers
for yard trimmings. Residents and businesses located in unincorporated areas of Carroll
County may contract with a licensed hauler for yard waste pick-up for recycling.


County haulers, municipalities, businesses, and residents may deliver acceptable yard
waste to the Northern Landfill and Hoods Mill Landfill at no charge. The mulch generat-
ed from the yard waste is available to Carroll County residents and businesses at no
charge.


3.3.4.4 Household Hazardous Waste
HHWs are not accepted as part of the Carroll County recycling program. Carroll County
offers HHW events twice yearly. The events include HHW collection, prescription drug
turn-in, and paper shredding.




Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   3-15                   Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP.DOCX--020711
In 2009 and 2010, the HHW contractor recycled 608 and 853 pounds, respectively of the
HHW collected. Recycled materials included batteries, mercury and mercury-containing
items, propane cylinders, fluorescent light tubes, and bulbs.


3.3.4.5 Waste Oils/Antifreeze
Carroll County, in cooperation with MES, as well as with local municipalities and busi-
nesses, offers several motor oil and antifreeze recycling locations for County residents.
Used oils and antifreeze for recycling are received at the Northern Landfill, Hoods Mill
Landfill, and town maintenance garages in Hampstead and Sykesville. Used oil only may
be dropped off at Westminster's Public Works Facility, Manchester Garage, and Taney-
town Memorial Park, in addition to the facilities previously listed. There is a drop-off
limit of 5 gallons per week per resident. A number of these locations are not affiliated
with Carroll County but offer these services as a convenience for the public (see
http://www.menv.com/usedoilcollectionlocations.shtml; [accessed January 11, 2011] for
used motor oil and antifreeze collection centers).


In 2008 and 2009 Carroll County residents and commercial businesses recycled 35,039
and 37,738 gallons of oil and 1,777 and 2,627 gallons of antifreeze, respectively.


3.3.4.6 Tires
The disposal of scrap tires has been banned in Maryland landfills since 1994. Tires are
accepted for recycling and disposal at the Northern Landfill and the Hoods Landfill fa-
cilities at a limit of five tires per year per household.


In 2008 and 2009 1,357 and 1,368 tires, respectively were recycled as part of this pro-
gram.


Upon completion of construction of FCCRWTE, in accordance with the contract, scrap
tires generated in Carroll County will be transported to the Facility to process for energy
and metals recovery.

3.3.4.7 Electronics
Residents may drop off electronics for recycling at the Northern Landfill Facility free of
charge. Acceptable items include computer monitors, computer speakers, televisions (no
consoles), CPUs, computer mice, keyboards, cellular telephones, personal digital assis-
tants, printers, power supplies, laptop computers, scanners, computer cables and cords,
and miscellaneous circuit boards, chips, and cards.


3.3.4.8 Scrap Metals/Recyclable White Goods/Ash Recovery
Scrap metals/recyclable white goods are accepted for recycling at the Northern Landfill
and Hoods Mill Landfill facilities.


When FCCRWTE becomes operational, Acceptable Material will be brought to the Facil-
ity where it will be processed. Following combustion, bottom ash will be passed through
a screen to separate large metal materials; a magnetic separator will remove additional
ferrous metals. An eddy current separator will remove nonferrous metals. Metals recov-
ered at FCCRWTE will be recycled contractually.


A percentage of the ash recovered from FCCRWTE will be taken to the Northern Land-
fill where it will be used as daily cover. NEA, in cooperation with Carroll County, will
investigate other ash recycling options.

                                          4.0 ALTERNATE DISPOSAL OPTIONS


4.1        FREDERICK COUNTY
Frederick County in 2005 identified the following as alternate solid waste disposal op-
tions:
             ·          Continuation of the current long-haul transfer to disposal facilities located
                        outside of Frederick County.
             ·          Investigation of alternative conversion technologies that show potential in
                        converting the MSW stream to energy products (waste to ethanol, waste ga-
                        sification, and plastics to oil).
             ·          Construction of a County-only WTE facility sized to meet the waste dispos-
                        al needs of just Frederick County.
             ·          Construction of a regional WTE facility sized to meet the waste disposal
                        needs of Frederick County and other public entities in the area.
             ·          Construction of a solid waste composting facility where process residues are
                        long-hauled out of Frederick County for disposal.


To preserve disposal capacity at the Reichs Ford Road Landfill, Frederick County is pur-
suing the construction and operation of FCCRWTE. The landfill will continue in opera-
tion at a reduced tonnage acceptance rate to serve as a buffer to transfer operations and as
an alternative waste management option in the event that conditions develop that prec-
lude solid waste transfer to FCCRWTE or another disposal site. FCCRWTE will neither
accept source separated Acceptable Recyclable Material nor prohibit the further devel-
opment of the County's existing recycling and waste reduction programs.


4.2        CARROLL COUNTY
Carroll County in 2005 identified the following as alternate solid waste disposal options:
             ·          Continuation of the transfer, transportation, and disposal of County waste at
                        disposal facilities located outside Carroll County.

             ·          Investigation of alternative conversion technologies that show potential in
                        converting the MSW stream to energy products (waste to ethanol, waste ga-
                        sification, and plastics to oil).
             ·          Construction of a County-only WTE facility sized to meet the waste dispos-
                        al needs of just Carroll County.

                        needs of Carroll County and other public entities in the area.
             ·          Construction of a solid waste composting facility where process residues are
                        long-hauled out of Carroll County for disposal.
             ·          Co-composting of MSW with sewage sludge at the landfill (this option was
                        explored but rejected for a variety of logistical reasons).


To preserve disposal capacity at the Northern Landfill, Carroll County is pursuing the
construction and operation of FCCRWTE. The landfill will continue in operation at a re-
duced tonnage acceptance rate to serve as a buffer to transfer operations and as an alter-
native waste management option in the event that conditions develop that preclude solid
waste transfer to FCCRWTE or another disposal site. FCCRWTE will neither accept
source separated Acceptable Recyclable Material nor prohibit the further development of
the County's existing recycling and waste reduction programs.

                                                          5.0 SUMMARY


Both Frederick and Carroll Counties have developed and updated SWMPs that provide
the framework for implementation of solid waste management decisions in their respec-
tive counties. The SWMPs incorporate source reduction, reuse, and recycling programs
that demonstrate achievement of and exceed the state of Maryland's waste diversion
goals. Both Counties have comprehensive and successful material separation and recy-
cling programs that have been in place for a number of years. Frederick County was one
of three communities nationwide selected in 2010 by CVP, a program of Keep America
Beautiful, Inc., to develop an educational recycling campaign called "Learn More, Re-
cycle Better." FCCRWTE will complement and enhance these county programs.


As a result of long-range planning investigations with NEA, both Counties entered into
an MOU by and among Frederick County, Carroll County, and NEA for the development
of a regional WTE facility (July 2009). This MOU described the site location in Frede-
rick County; the ownership, design, and capacity of the facility; as well as the responsi-
bilities of NEA, the Counties, and the vendor.


Through the reduction, reuse, and recycling strategies described herein, a considerable
amount of materials will be separated, reused, and recovered for recycling purposes prior
to entering the MSW stream. Only nonrecycled solid waste will be delivered and
processed at FCCRWTE, where it will be used to generate clean, renewable electricity
for potential use at the government facilities of Frederick and Carroll Counties.
FCCRWTE will be an integral part of the Counties' recycling programs, as some ferrous
and nonferrous metals that are not currently recycled will be recovered from the ash as
part of the FCCRWTE operations and reused for various purposes.


NEA believes the reduction, reuse, and recycling strategies described in this document
will ensure the Counties will continue to meet and exceed the state of Maryland's waste
diversion goal of 20 percent, the voluntary statewide waste diversion goal of 40 percent,
and assist the Counties in achieving their recycling and diversion goals.

 1                          PROCEEDINGS

 2                JUDGE SHARER:   Good evening, ladies and

 3   gentlemen.   The first question I have, is the sound too

 4   loud, or is it sufficient?    Can I be heard?

 5                A MEMBER OF THE AUDIENCE:    Very good.

 6                JUDGE SHARER:   Thank you.

 7                Tonight's hearing, as it has been

 8   advertised, is for the Preliminary Draft Materials

 9   Separation Plan public meeting dealing with the

10   Frederick and Carroll County joint venture renewable

11   waste-to-energy project.

12                My name, as you see at the bottom, is

13   Frederick Sharer.   I live in Cumberland; I'm not a

14   resident of either Frederick or Carroll County, and I

15   have been invited to moderate this evening's meeting.

16                Just a bit about me.    I, two years ago,

17   retired as a judge of the Maryland Court of Special

18   Appeals, on which I sat for eight years, and I still sit

19   with that court in retirement part time.

20                Before that, I sat as a Circuit Court judge

21   in Allegheny County, in Cumberland, for 21 years, and I

                                                                   5



 1   have been invited to moderate this evening's meeting.

 2              The meeting format is for the acceptance of

 3   oral and/or written comments.   And as you will see, and

 4   I will remind you, even after tonight, written comments

 5   can be accepted through September 30th, and there will

 6   be an address made available to you so that if you wish

 7   to submit written comments, you may do so.

 8              Those of you who wish to be heard tonight,

 9   we would ask you to, if you have not already done so, to

10   sign the signup sheet just outside the entrance so that

11   we may not miss anybody and so that we may have an

12   accurate tally of who has spoken.

13              We will base the order of speakers on the

14   order of the signup sheet, but we will make an exception

15   if there are any public officials present who wish to

16   comment and who may have other obligations this evening,

17   we will, with I'm sure the acquiescence of the audience,

18   move you to the front of the queue.

19              The rules of the game, if you will, are that

20   there are to be comments, not questions.   There will be

21   no dialogue, no debate.   We will ask you to use your

 2              We have this very sophisticated timing

 3   device here on the table, which my assistant timer, Mark

 4   Carney, will operate.

 5              Your comments are limited.    We ask you to

 6   keep them to three minutes, which I understand is

 7   consistent with the policy of various public boards and

 8   agencies here in Frederick County and in Carroll County.

 9              If you wish to speak, we ask you to identify

10   yourselves; speak into the microphone.   There is a

11   gentleman just below me here in the front row,

12   Mr. Tudor, who is taking down by way of a stenotype

13   machine everything that is said at the meeting tonight,

14   so we need to have knowledge of who you are.

15              Following the meeting, Mr. Tudor will

16   prepare a written transcript of all of the comments

17   tonight and they will be made available publicly.

18              At this point, I would introduce Mark

19   Carney, who is going to tell you more than I know about

20   the details of the matters about which we are here

21   tonight, which is limited to the materials and the

 1   material separation aspect of this project.

 2                MR. CARNEY:   Do you want to switch the

 3   slides?

 4                Again, my name is Mark Carney.   I'm managing

 5   director of e3rm, an environmental consulting firm here

 6   in Frederick County.    Again to remind everyone of the

 7   meeting format, we're accepting oral and written

 8   comments, and the written comments will be accepted

 9   until September 30th.    There are signup sheets in the

10   theater, and the order of speakers will be as the Judge

11   described.

12                What we're going to go over tonight, very

13   quickly, because this information is all in the Material

14   Separation Plan that is on line and is at all the

15   Frederick and Carroll County libraries, we will go

16   through sections of the Material Separation Plan and

17   then provide additional details of where you can submit

18   your written comments.

19                For introduction, the Northeast Maryland

20   Waste Disposal Authority has developed in Frederick and

21   Carroll Counties a renewable waste-to-energy facility to

22




                                                        Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                    8



 1   serve the long-term solid waste disposal needs of

 2   Frederick and Carroll counties.

 3                This Preliminary Draft Material Separation

 4   Plan is prepared to fulfill the requirements of the

 5   Environmental Protection Agency New Source Performance

 6   Standard, and you can see the citation there for the

 7   facility.

 8                What the Preliminary Draft MSP does is

 9   identifies the goals and approaches for separating

10   certain components of the material solid waste stream in

11   the two counties in order to make the separated

12   materials available for recycling.

13                Now, the facility is located in Frederick

14   County's McKenney Industrial Park, adjacent to the

15   County's Ballenger-McKenney sewage treatment plant.

16   It's a nominal 1500-ton-a-day municipal solid waste

17   facility.   It will treat thermally up to 50,000 tons of

18   sewage sludge.   It will accept and thermally treat scrap

19   tires, will generate up to 55 megawatts of electricity,

20   with the export of 45 megawatts or more for sale.     It

21   will recover approximately 15,000 tons of ferrous and

22




                                                       Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                    9



 1   nonferrous metals not otherwise recovered as part of the

 2   County's recycling program.

 3                The size of the service area is basically,

 4   the primary service area is all residential, business,

 5   industrial, business institutions and commercial waste

 6   generators of Frederick and Carroll Counties.

 7                Now, additional waste from outside the

 8   primary service area may be accepted, subject to the

 9   County's approval, to enable the facility to generate

10   the maximum amount of renewable energy.

11                Each County is required under Maryland law

12   to have a Solid Waste Management Plan.    Frederick County

13   has a plan that was updated in 2005, and currently that

14   plan is under revision.

15                Carroll County has a ten-year solid waste

16   management plan that was updated in 2006 and reviewed in

17   2007.

 1              The top two lines, the green line is the

 2   processable solid waste generated in Frederick County,

 3   and then beneath that, the blue line is the Maryland

 4   Recovery Act tons recycled.   And you can see that growth

 5   projection from 2015 to 2025.   And then the purple line

 6   is Carroll County processable solid waste, and then the

 7   red solid block there is the MRA tons recycled from

 8   Carroll County.

 9              In 2015, Frederick County projects 170,000

10   tons of Maryland Recycling Act recycled material, and

11   that includes the single-stream recycling program, both

12   curbside and dropoff, the additional recycling programs

13   that are held at the Reichs Ford landfill, yard waste

14   composting, the two annual events for the household

15   hazardous waste, waste oils and antifreeze collection

16   programs, a tire collection program, and electronics.

17   Further details of this are included in the Material

18   Separation Plan.

19              In 2015, Carroll County projects 88,000 tons

20   of MRA recyclable material, and they have a very similar

21   type of program, single-stream recycling, curbside and

                                                                    11



 1   dropoff.   They also have additional recycling programs

 2   at their two landfill locations, yard waste mulching.

 3   They also have two annual events that they hold for

 4   household hazardous waste, they do collection of waste

 5   oil and antifreeze throughout the county, and they

 6   collect tires and have an electronic recycling program,

 7   too.

 8                The additional methods for material

 9   separation that will be added by this facility is the

10   scrap metals recovery and recycling through the waste

11   energy facility.   Approximately 15,000 tons of ferrous

12   and nonferrous metals will be recovered through this

13   process after processing through the waste energy

14   facility, and will be recycled.   And this is over and

15   above any of the recycling that's recovered in either of

16   the 2010 recycling programs.

17                This leaves the amount of residual waste

18   expectation for Frederick County, you can see, is

19   196,000 tons of processible solid waste in 2015, Carroll

20   County is estimating 136,000, and then in 2025, the

21   estimate for Frederick County is 212,000, approximately,

 1   and 151,000 for Carroll County in 2025.

 2              Other considerations that are part of the

 3   Material Separation Plan is the fact that you need to

 4   identify if there are other alternate disposal methods.

 5   Frederick County did an extensive study over the past

 6   ten years, looking at a variety of different options,

 7   long-haul transfer, alternative conversion technologies,

 8   construction of a county waste-to-energy facility and a

 9   regional facility, and then looked also at a constructed

10   solid waste composting facility.

11              And again, Carroll County did a similar type

12   investigation, transport, transfer and disposal outside

13   of Carroll County, alternate conversion technologies, a

14   countywide waste energy facility and a regional

15   facility, and then construction of a solid waste

16   composting, and they also looked at co-composting with

17   municipal solid waste and sewage sludge.

18              Now, I'm sure you're aware of the fact that

19   the Material Separation Plan is located in all of the

20   Carroll and Frederick County libraries.    It was provided

21   to libraries on July 30th and will remain in libraries

 3              The next step is the preparation.   After

 4   this hearing, we will take the written responses and

 5   prepare -- written responses or any comments that were

 6   made; then we will identify the locations, written

 7   responses for the public comment for the -- on the

 8   preliminary draft, and then we will prepare a final

 9   draft Material Separation Plan.

10              These terminologies we're using here, final

11   draft, preliminary draft, these are terminologies that

12   are part of the regulation; that's why we're calling

13   them as we are.

14              And then as part of this, we are required to

15   submit to the Maryland Department of Environment as part

16   of the construction permit application for the facility

17   a copy of the notification, the transcript of the public

18   meeting, the documents summarizing the responses and

19   copies of both the preliminary draft and the final draft

20   of the Material Separation Plan.

 1   and we will hear you.    And the first speaker is Emily

 2   Dyson.

 3               MS. DYSON:    Thank you for the opportunity to

 4   speak today.   My name is Emily Dyson, D-Y-S-O-N, and I'm

 5   a resident of Carroll County.    My husband and I and two

 6   children have lived in Mount Airy for 26 years.    I have

 7   been an environmental professional for twenty years and

 8   have direct experience in the biological and air

 9   monitoring experience for source separation facilities,

10   incinerators and waste energy projects, specifically

11   with the Montgomery County waste separation facility and

12   incinerator project that was conducted in the early

13   1990's.

14               I have reviewed the Preliminary Draft                         DYSON-1
15   Material Separation Plan for Frederick and Carroll

16   County waste energy facility, and I agree with the plan

17   set forth and with the ultimate destination of specific

18   waste to the waste-to-energy facility in Frederick

19   County.

20               Source separation promotes the removal of                     DYSON-2
21   all designated recyclable materials from the waste

22




                                                        Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                    16




 1   stream, and therefore helps to achieve high solid waste                   DYSON-2 (cont.)
 2   reduction rates.

 3              There is a Maryland Executive Order which

 4   states that each county will attain a 20 percent

 5   recycling goal.    Frederick County's 2007 recycling rate

 6   was estimated to be at 41.32 percent, while Carroll

 7   County's 2007 recycling rate was estimated to be at

 8   28.33.

 9              Although both counties are currently

10   exceeding the 20 percent target, development of a

11   formalized source separation program with additional

12   reusable material separated before and after the waste

13   energy process.    This will increase those percentages,

14   thereby reducing the counties' expenses for

15   transportation of out-of-state solid waste, as well as

16   reducing the associated environmental impact, greenhouse

17   gas, for example.

18              My experience has been with the studies done                   DYSON-3
19   on background biological indicators, as the chemical

20   uptake in vegetables, skin tissue of fish, cow's milk,

21   as well as air monitoring of particulates and chemical

                                                        Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                   17




 1   deposition before the start of an incinerator project                    DYSON-3 (cont.)
 2   and one to two years after the start of a project.

 3              The results that I had access to showed that

 4   the biological indicators showed no increase or change

 5   to the chemical uptake from the baseline.    The air

 6   monitoring showed that there was an increase in

 7   particulate deposition; however, it was still well below

 8   the federal regulatory limits.   Chemical deposition did

 9   change; however, not significantly, and again, well

10   below the federal regulatory limits.

11              I encourage the Frederick and Carroll County                  DYSON-4
12   commissions to move forward with the Material Separation

13   Plan and with the waste energy facility.

14              Thank you.

15              JUDGE SHARER:    Thank you.

16              Tom Inccarino.

17              MR. INCCARINO:    Good evening.   My name is

18   Tom Inccarino, I-N-C-C-A-R-I-N-O.   I'm a resident of

19   Frederick County.

20              I have reviewed the draft of the Material                     IACCARINO-1
21   Separation Plan for the Frederick and Carroll County

                                                       Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711

 1   renewable waste and energy facility.   I agree with the                 IACCARINO-1 (cont.)
 2   goals and objectives of the draft plan for separating

 3   components of the municipal solid waste stream and to

 4   make these separated components available for recycling

 5   before the post-recycling materials are processed by the

 6   WTE facility.

 7               The reduction, reuse and recycling

 8   strategies described in the draft plan indicate that a

 9   considerable amount of materials will be separated,

10   reused and recovered for recycling purposes.

11               As an environmental professional with over                  IACARRINO-2
12   thirty years of experience and a long-time resident of

13   Frederick County, I believe the WTE facility represents

14   the right answer to Frederick County's municipal solid

15   waste problems.

16               The WTE facility is a prudent process for

17   the safe disposal of post-recycled municipal solid waste

18   and will result in the generation of clean, renewable

19   energy.

20               From an environmental standpoint, the WTE                   IACCARRINO-3
21   facility will be equipped with state-of-the-art air

 3                The WTE project will also result in reduced                   IACARRINO-4
 4   generation of greenhouse gas emissions which would

 5   otherwise be generated from the equivalent generation of

 6   electricity up to 55 megawatts, the greenhouse gas

 7   emissions associated with transportation of municipal

 8   solid waste to other out-of-state landfills, and the

 9   subsequent generation of methane, a greenhouse gas

10   associated with the landfilling of municipal solid

11   waste.

12                Thank you for this opportunity to speak.

13                JUDGE SHARER:    Thank you.

14                Dave Wrock?    I hope I have gotten your name

15   correctly.

16                MR. WROCK:    Dave Wrock.

17                JUDGE SHARER:    Thank you.   Sorry.

18                MR. WROCK:    I have not reviewed the entire                  RAK-1
19   document, but I notice that there was an omission.

20   Section 2.1 says, "Additional waste from outside of the

21   primary service area will be accepted to enable the

22




                                                         Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                    20




 1   Frederick/Carroll County renewable waste energy facility                  RAK-1 (cont.)
 2   to operate at its designed capacity."

 3               I think that is that it must be accepted in

 4   order to allow it to operate as its design capacity, and

 5   the draft for material separation is missing the

 6   information for the other trash that will be imported.

 7               JUDGE SHARER:    Thank you.

 8               Dave Twigg?

 9               MR. TWIGG:    Hello, and thank you for this

10   opportunity to speak.

11               My name is Dave Twigg.    I'm a long-time

12   resident of Frederick County.    I live in Tuscarora, in

13   the shadow of the Jefferson waste of energy (sic) plant,

14   and my concern is similar to the gentleman that just

15   spoke before.

16               In 2.1, in the service areas, it mentions                     TWIGG-1
17   that additional waste from outside of the primary

18   service area will be accepted to enable the facility to

19   operate at its design capacity.    And if you look at

20   figure 2.1 in the chart there, it shows by 2025, the

21   projected amount of waste will be approximately 390,000

22




                                                        Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                   21




 1   tons, and that's before you separate out the recoverable                 TWIGG-1 (cont.)
 2   materials.

 3                I did a little bit of math on that, and it

 4   still doesn't come to 1,500 tons a day, so it's obvious

 5   that they must take solid waste from other areas to

 6   enable the plant to operate at peak capacity in order to

 7   achieve that 55 megawatts that the plant will generate.

 8                I found the point to be vague; there was not                TWIGG-2
 9   much detail on transporting this waste from the

10   transport area to the facility at the McKenney site.

11   I'm very concerned about that and the traffic that that

12   will generate in that area.   There is really a very

13   large lack of detail in this draft.

14                I would also like to see the studies the                    TWIGG-3
15   County performed in alternative methods.   I don't think

16   we have seen those, and I would like to have those

17   somewhere public.   And some of the speakers before me                   TWIGG-4
18   mentioned about the materials being discharged to the

19   air, and all plants that burn create dioxins, and

20   science just doesn't know yet what the effects of those

21   dioxins are on people; they can only guess.

 1               I am strongly opposed to this plant, and I                    TWIGG-5
 2   think this draft report is poorly written and lacking in

 3   detail.

 4               Thank you.

 9               Thank you.

10               MS. TONE:    Karen Tone.   And I am a common

11   sense resident from Brunswick, Maryland.

12               If the purpose the purpose of this plan, as                   TOME-1
13   stated on page 1-1 is to identify the goals and

14   approaches for separating certain components of the

15   municipal waste stream in both Frederick and Carroll

16   Counties in order to make the separated materials

17   available for recycling, then why aren't we looking at

18   maximizing that amount of material in the first place?

19               In an email from County Attorney John                         TOME-2
20   Mathias -- in an email from the County Attorney, John

21   Mathias stated, "The BOCC may impose conditions on a

 4   use the County facility."

 5              Continuing, he stated, "The BOCC is provided

 6   authority in State law to prescribe rules for the use of

 7   County solid waste facilities.   These rules provide that

 8   only haulers providing only certain services, such as

 9   curbside recycling and pickup to its customers would be

10   licensed to use the County facilities.   Those rules

11   would only apply to those haulers who use the County

12   facilities," end quote.

13              A friend of mine has referred to this as "my

14   landfill, my rules."   Since tiered pricing programs,

15   which treat trash and recycling disposal in the same way

16   that utilities do -- in other words, you pay only for

17   what you throw out in the trash, the recycling charge is

18   also included in that price.   Since these programs have

19   been shown to drastically reduce the amount of waste

20   that has to be disposed of in a community, why wouldn't

21   the authority first recommend this strategy?   Granted,

22

 1   it would involve sitting down with the haulers in our                   TOME-2 (cont.)
 2   county and working out a renewable program.   It would

 3   also involve having the County step back a bit from what

 4   they view as a costly recycling program and in turn give

 5   the opportunity to our local private businesses for

 6   hauling.

 7              Since the County has been given the                          TOME-3
 8   authority to develop the best type of recycling and

 9   disposal program, why was this never identified with the

10   other options on page 4-1 as an alternate solid waste

11   disposal option?

12              On page 1-3 of the plan, it states, "The                     TOME-4
13   recognized benefits of reducing the MSW stream through

14   recycling include a reduction in transportation costs, a

15   reduction in the amount of disposal fees to the citizens

16   due to reduced volumes, and an increase in the longevity

17   of the life of the local landfill.   Most importantly, by

18   actively supporting recycling efforts, the Counties and

19   the authority, NEA, are preserving valuable resources."

20              If this is truly what the Authority is all

21   about, then why doesn't the service contract state that

22




                                                      Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711

 1   the facility will not burn valuable recyclable material?                   TOME-4 (cont.)
 2   Or could it be that this plan is just what many people

 3   are referring to as window dressing.

 4                 Another question I had, I wanted to make one                 TOME-5
 5   comment, that 20 percent of waste recyclables is

 6   pitiful, in my opinion.     That's just way too low.     I

 7   know that's not an argument with the plan.      It's just my

 8   opinion.

 9                 It also says that we're -- you say that they                 TOME-6
10   are counting these MRA's as recyclable material.       So why

11   are we going to burn them when we're already recycling

12   them?   And does that mean that we are going to burn

13   other material that (inaudible.)

17                 MS. CUBITT:   Good evening.   I am Julia

18   Cubitt.    I am a fifteen-year resident of Frederick

19   County.    I work for the County also.

20                 I also work at the library, and I would like                 CUBIT-1
21   to comment on the lack of transparency in the document

 1   and I also would like to comment on the inability of the                   CUBIT-1 (cont.)
 2   common citizen to have access to this document.

 3                I know it's at the authority's website.        I

 4   went there myself.   You cannot print off that website.

 5   You can download that document to a computer.    You

 6   cannot print off of that computer.    If I wanted to

 7   circulate this document, I would have to -- I don't have

 8   a copy.   I would have to go to the library, print a copy

 9   and then circulate it that way.

10                This is lack of access, as far as I'm

11   concerned.   In a day when everyone has access to a

12   computer and a printer and should be concerned about

13   this big monstrosity that's coming to our county, we

14   should all have access to this.

15                I would also like to follow up on                             CUBIT-2
16   Mr. Twigg's comment about the ineffectuality of the

17   document itself.   There is a lot of words on it.     I

18   didn't see anything of substance.    I saw the numbers.

19   We have things to disagree with.    We would like to see

20   the numbers behind the assumptions made in a lot of

21   parts of this document.

 1                I think the whole process has been like                        CUBIT-3
 2   this, in that it gives the community as little as

 3   possible and let's just sneak this project by as fast as

 4   we can.

 6                JUDGE SHARER:    Thank you.

 7                (Applause.)

 8                JUDGE SHARER:    Ellis Burris?

 9                MR. BURRIS:    Good evening.    My name is Ellis

10   Burris.   I'm a resident of Brunswick.      Been in Frederick

11   County for thirty years.     By way of identification, I am

12   a candidate for the Board of County Commissioners.

13                I wanted to pick up on what a previous

14   speaker was talking about -- well, first off, just a

15   personal comment, and that is, I object to the term                         BURRUSS-1
16   "thermally processed."     I think the correct word is

17   "burned."   That's what most people will understand.

18                The table, figure 2-1 that we saw on the                       BURRUSS-2
19   screen earlier, does indicate, as a previous speaker

20   mentioned, that in the year 2025 it is projected that

21   there will be from Frederick County 575 tons per day of

22




                                                          Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                   28




 1   fuel for the plant and 411 tons per day from Carroll                     BURRUSS-2 (cont.)
 2   County, for a total of 986 tons.   This leaves a deficit,

 3   according to your figures, of 514 tons per day in the

 4   1500 tons per day capacity of the facility.   So it's

 5   built into the plan as presented here that there clearly

 6   has to transport from other jurisdictions in order to

 7   operate the plant at anywhere near its peak efficiency.

 8              On page 3.1, at the very bottom, continuing                   BURRUSS-3
 9   onto page 3.2, it states, "The Frederick County

10   Commissioners have established a waste division goal

11   that the material removed from the waste stream for

12   recycling, composting or other strategies, including

13   source reduction, of 60 percent by the year 2025."      I

14   presume those figures, then, were based on including

15   that 60 percent figure.

16              I think we should take into account the

17   possibility that future Boards of County Commissioners

18   could very well take a more aggressive stance toward

19   that reduction through more recycling from residential

20   and business and industry and reducing the waste stream

21   considerably by recycling and composting of food wastes

22




                                                       Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711

 1   from institutions, restaurants, grocery stores and so                    BURRUSS-3 (cont.)
 2   forth, so that the more the waste stream is reduced, the

 3   less is going to be left to burn.   I mean, this is just

 4   common sense.   And so it is inevitable that we're going

 5   to importing more and more fuel for the plant.

 6               One of the other handouts prior to this                      BURRUSS-4
 7   meeting indicated there was a list of several things

 8   that would be accomplished by building the facility, and

 9   one of them, which may seem ridiculous, but it was

10   stated, anyway, was that this plant would help Frederick

11   County become energy-independent.   It would be extremely

12   ironic if Frederick County were to become

13   energy-independent, but trash-dependent.

14               (Applause.)

15               JUDGE SHARER:   Susan Hanson.

16               MS. HANSON:   Good evening.   My name is Susan

17   Hanson, and I'm a long-time resident and business owner

18   from Jefferson, Maryland.

19               I have been opposed to this incinerator from                 HANSON-1

20   day one.   This is the first time that I have seen in                    HANSON-2
21   print or publicly that importing trash from other areas

 1   is accepted.    In other words, it's printed, it's there,                HANSON-2 (cont.)
 2   it's welcome.    It's not -- this program before, I

 3   thought, was limited to Carroll County and Frederick

 4   County.    This specifically opens the door to other

 5   counties and other areas, which, again, I think is

 6   interesting.

 7                 But I also am very concerned about what                    HANSON-3
 8   Ellis Burris was talking about before this, which is

 9   compromising the recycle program by this, what he was

10   talking about, if they don't meet the needs for

11   maximizing the electric production, to look outside of

12   Carroll and Frederick counties.

13                 I'm concerned that they will also use more                 HANSON-4
14   of the resources, recycled resources, which obviously

15   their higher and best use is to keep them in production

16   and in use and manufacture, rather than burning them,

17   but those also specifically are not eliminated from this

18   process.

19                 I also am concerned with the elected public                HANSON-5
20   officials talking about, and I would like to know

21   publicly and on the record, jobs, the number of jobs

22

 1   that this facility will be offering to Frederick County                    HANSON-5 (cont.)
 2   residents and the pay scales and the educational levels

 3   that those jobs will require, just for comparison to,

 4   say, a resource recovery farm or something like that.

 5              Thank you very much.

 6              JUDGE SHARER:    Thank you.

 7              (Applause.)

 8              Daniel Andrews.

 9              MR. ANDREWS:    Hello.   I'm here from

10   Westminster, Maryland, Carroll County.    I am a member of

11   the Carroll County Environmental Advisory Council, which

12   is referenced on page 3-10 of this document, but I'm not

13   here directly representing them as a council.    I am here

14   representing myself as a citizen of Carroll County, as

15   well as the chairman of the local Sierra Club group.

16              I think the comment on page 3-10 needs to be                    ANDREWS-1
17   further elaborated if you're going to make mention of

18   it, and specifically, there should be a link to the

19   recommendations that were put forth from the

20   Environmental Advisory Council in October of 2007.

21   Those recommends can be found at

22




                                                         Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                  32




 1   ccgovernment.carr.org/cpg/eac/recommend.pdm.   I want to                ANDREWS-1 (cont.)

 2   cover a few of those recommendations for this meeting.

 3              First, the council recommended that Carroll                  ANDREWS-2
 4   County change the paradigm from solid waste management

 5   to resource management.   That would involve elevating

 6   recycling as the driving element of resource management,

 7   one, by creating and verifying recycling reporting

 8   policies, and two, by managing its own system in order

 9   to direct recycled goods to specific recovery centers,

10   and three, by increasing funding to recycling operations

11   for expanded public education efforts.

12              The board also recommended that the Board of

13   County Commissioners view public education and behavior

14   modification as essential in the transition to the new

15   paradigm of resource management.   This will require

16   staff and media attention as needed.

17              Again, the board -- or the council also

18   recommended not supporting the plan for the construction

19   of this waste-to-energy facility, but, rather, that the

20   County's efforts direct its resource management strategy

21   as outlined above, or as I have described, for a period

22

                                                                   33




 1   of five years.                                                           ANDREWS-2 (cont.)
 2              The council also recommended that the Board

 3   of Commissioners implement and support pay-as-you-throw

 4   trash collection programs and the commission, the EAC,

 5   to work in concert with the Department of Public Works

 6   to create a community process to begin or to design

 7   essential elements of that program.

 8              The council also recommended that the Board

 9   of Commissioners of Carroll County undertake a

10   feasibility study of creating a county-wide composting

11   facility where organic material could be turned back

12   into useful products for local farmers and reduce

13   greenhouse gases.

14              In closing, I just wanted to make everyone

15   aware of those recommendations and that they be

16   referenced in this plan.

17              Thank you.

18              JUDGE SHARER:    Thank you, sir.

19              (Applause.)

20              JUDGE SHARER:    Don West.

21              MR. WEST:    Good evening.   My name is Don

22




                                                       Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                    34



 1   West, and that's W-E-S-T.    That's pretty easy.

 2               I'm a 25-year resident of Carroll County,

 3   just outside of Westminster, and I, too, have read this                   WEST-1
 4   report from cover to cover, and I couldn't help but

 5   wonder what this Material Separation Plan had to do with

 6   waste energy incineration.

 7               In my opinion, recycling and waste-to-energy                  WEST-2
 8   are competing for the same resources.    They're in direct

 9   competition.   And I must say that I am severely

10   underwhelmed by my county, Carroll County's, efforts

11   when it comes to recycling.    There is no incentives for

12   the residents, there is no commercial program, no

13   composting of food waste.    Frankly, I view it as a lack

14   of leadership.

15               And within the media, within the Material                     WEST-3
16   Separation Plan, there is a table on page 1-1 that talks

17   about the Frederick and Carroll County Solid Waste

18   Management Plan, and under Carroll County it says, "The

19   effective implementation of an integrated system of

20   solid waste management and recycling that will allow

21   sufficient flexibility to react to changes in

22

 1   regulation, technology and market conditions."                             WEST-3 (cont.)
 2                 I guess my question is, how does a

 3   thirty-year agreement with this waste energy facility

 4   meet those criteria?

 5                 In closing, I view this evening's effort as                  WEST-4
 6   a bit disingenuous.    My question of the EPA and the

 7   Maryland Department of the Environment is simply, is

 8   your mission to protect the health of our citizens and

 9   the environment of our state, or to protect the health

10   of waste management and the environment for these big

11   industries?

12                 Thank you very much.

13                 JUDGE SHARER:   Dan Reever.

14                 MR. REEVER:   Hello.   My name is Dan Reever;

15   I'm from northern Frederick County, just outside of

16   Emmitsburg.

17                 I would just like to say I'm in support of                   REAVER-1
18   this project.    A majority of our Frederick County

19   commissioners have joined with a majority of Carroll

20   County commissioners to craft a plan after more than

21   five years of study that includes the best long-term

 1   options for the waste reduction, recycling and                           REAVER-1 (cont.)
 2   dependable, cost-competitive renewable waste energy

 3   technology that has successfully served other

 4   communities in Maryland, the United States and the

 5   world.

 6              Many communities fail to plan for their

 7   future needs and invest in their long-term

 8   infrastructure.   Our county leaders have done their

 9   homework and set a responsible course of action that is

10   safe, sustainable and will solve our trash problem.

11              The County's plan for recycling renewable

12   waste energy as reflected in the Material Separation

13   Plan has my support.   I would encourage others to

14   consider the benefits of this project.

15              Thank you.

18              MS. SNYDER:    Hello.   My name is Carolyn

19   Snyder, S-N-Y-D-E-R.   I'm a resident of Frederick City.

20   I have been in Frederick County more than 40 years.

21              First I would like to mention that in this                    SNYDER-1

                                                       Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                    37




 1   plan that's referenced, on page 4-1, they talk about the                  SNYDER-1 (cont.)
 2   solid waste options for Frederick County being the

 3   construction of a composting facility to process

 4   residues long-hauled out of Frederick County for

 5   disposal.

 6                Some of us -- and I'm involved with an

 7   environmental group -- some of us would ask why wasn't a

 8   large-scale source separating composting facility

 9   concerned?

10                I'm pleased to see that a member of FRC

11   wrote a fine, well-written letter to the editor that the

12   Frederick News Post printed yesterday, and it talked

13   about a number of other ways to look at things,

14   increased opportunity for local recycling, and the news,

15   the great news is that there is another organization,

16   Waste Neutral, that will begin hauling the organic waste

17   and compostable materials, all food wastes, from

18   professional facilities, restaurants, fish, the kind of

19   things you can't compost in your own home, a long list

20   of other items.   This was great news to me, because I

21   know that there is a whole lot of waste materials, and I

22




                                                        Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                  38



 1   would like to direct attention to that.

 2              In my own personal situation, I have been

 3   composting, again, since I lived in the country, I do a

 4   lot of composting, and it's really amazing to see how

 5   all of this waste from your kitchen can turn into great

 6   soil.

 7              My neighbor was so sad after many years of

 8   growing tomatoes, fertilizing chemically, his whole crop

 9   died and mine had thrived, and he wondered why, and I

10   told him about this thing called composting.   He really

11   didn't know anything about it.   It's nice to see his

12   interest in that.

13              Basically, I think it's important -- from                    SNYDER-2
14   what I know, the plans for this waste-to-energy, this

15   incinerator to burn trash, these plans were made way

16   before the remarkable use in recycling rates offered to

17   Frederick City, especially since we began the single

18   stream process.   And such a cost, with those possible

19   dangers that are unknown, made before we have this new

20   information, need to be reconsidered.

21              Don't underestimate my fellow citizens.

 3               JUDGE SHARER:   Sally Sorbello.

 4               MS. SORBELLO:   Good evening.   My name is

 5   Sally Sorbello.   I live in Frederick, Maryland.

 6               My concerns regarding the Authority's Draft                   SORBELLO-1
 7   Materials Separation Plan include, but are not limited

 8   to the following:   Trends documented in reports from the

 9   Covanta incinerator in Montgomery County, Maryland, have

10   shown that, A, increased recycling decreases the

11   quantity of materials available for incineration, and B,

12   source reduction and recycling of materials such as

13   paper and plastic diminishes the energy value of

14   incineration, which reduces the electrical generating

15   capability of the facility.

16               In other words, as other speakers have said,

17   recycling and incineration are not compatible.     They

18   directly compete with each other, both materially and

19   financially.   I don't believe our county can afford a

20   comprehensive recycling program if we are spending tens

21   of millions of dollars a year to subsidize the

22




                                                        Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                     40




 1   incinerator operation and we cannot produce enough                         SORBELLO-1 (cont.)
 2   electricity for incineration if we are recycling

 3   effectively.

 4                Also, I'm concerned that there is no                          SORBELLO-2
 5   separation of material at the incinerator.   Any milk jug

 6   or aluminum cans or paper or plastic that arrives at the

 7   plant will be burned.   Also, any recovered ferrous metal

 8   is retrieved by use of magnets to pull them out of the

 9   ash after burning.   I believe that these materials can

10   be recovered without the incinerator.

11                I also find it troubling on the authority                     SORBELLO-3
12   website in the About Us section, there is an image of

13   recyclable materials, cans, bottles, et cetera, which

14   are twirled around, and then they become a light bulb.

15   I think this is really implying that it's preferable to

16   burn these materials for a small amount of energy

17   recovery, rather than recycle them in order to save

18   energy.   Recycling saves three to five times the amount

19   of energy that incinerators produce when you look at the

20   life cycle of these materials.

21                Also, on page 3-8 of the Draft Material                       SORBELLO-4

                                                         Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                     41




 1   Separation Plan, it states that tires will be brought to                   SORBELLO-4 (cont.)
 2   the facility for burning, rather than being recycled.

 3              The environmental community discourages

 4   under any circumstances the use of tires as fuel.

 5   Burning tires is extremely polluting.    In tests all

 6   around the country there have been increases in air

 7   pollution as a direct result of tire incineration.

 8   There have been increases in mercury, lead, zinc,

 9   sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, arsenic and benzine.

10   These compounds are carcinogenic.    Mercury from tire

11   burning is linked to brain, lung, kidney damage,

12   reproductive problems and death.    Very young children

13   and the unborn are especially vulnerable to these

14   effects.

15              Tires can be utilized instead for an almost

16   unlimited range of creative uses, including auto parts,

17   playground equipment, sound barriers, railroad ties and

18   tennis courts.   Burning tires for limited energy

19   production which results in ash and air pollution is the

20   lowest use of scrap tires.

21              Also, I want to just reiterate, other people                    SORBELLO-5

                                                         Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711

 1   have said that due to the fact that the proposed                          SORBELLO-5 (cont.)
 2   incinerator requires approximately 1500 tons per day of

 3   material, which is almost twice what Frederick and

 4   Carroll Counties are currently producing, we will have

 5   to import from other counties, and probably other states

 6   as well.   Trash truck traffic will cause pollution,

 7   clogging our roads and our lungs for decades to come.

 8                This issue is not over.    I encourage all

 9   concerned Frederick residents to vote for candidates for

10   Frederick BOCC that oppose this plan.

11                Thank you very much.

12                (Applause.)

13                JUDGE SHARER:    Thank you.

14                Joanne Ivancic?

15                Was I close?

16                MS. IVANCIC:    Very close.

17                My name is Joanne Ivancic, I-V-A-N-C-I-C.        I

18   live here in Frederick City.

19                I'm thinking also that the 20 percent may be                 IVANCIC-1
20   a State standard, but it is not sufficient.     It should

21   be brought up as a floor revenue and ceiling.     We can

                                                        Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                      43




 1   reach much higher than that, and we should, and our                         IVANCIC-1 (cont.)
 2   plans should reflect that.

 3                 Also, I want to also say it is difficult to                   IVANCIC-2
 4   access this report, because it's not printable.      We had

 5   two people trying to download it; we could not download

 6   it at home.    We could not copy from it, so a friend who

 7   was trying to do written comments could not just copy

 8   what he was trying to comment on and just paste it into

 9   a comment.    And that, in 2010, is absurd.

10                 Because the current census will show                          IVANCIC-3
11   different growth rates for this area, the presentation

12   of the next version should take that updated data into

13   consideration.    Assumptions about what amount of wastes

14   are available are key to figuring out what size this

15   plant should be and would really need to use updated

16   information on what the growth rates are and how much we

17   can expect in increased recycling.

18                 Figure 2.1 estimates those growth rates, and

19   that's going to be out of date as soon as the new census

20   information comes out.

 1   experiences growth in its population, that's not true.                  IVANCIC-3 (cont.)

 2              There is no appendix, such as what was                       IVANCIC-4
 3   expressed, I explained that standards referenced should

 4   be either linked to so that you can efficiently link to

 5   them, or they should be listed as an appendix.

 6              There is no footnotes, so we're not able to                  IVANCIC-5
 7   tell where this information is coming from and to check

 8   it or to see what criticisms may have already been

 9   established for some of the sources of the information.

10   There is on mention of reviewing any other alternatives,

11   such as waste fields.

12              Also, analysis of the size of the facility.                  IVANCIC-6
13   If we are going to recycle more and cannot efficiently

14   use the size of facility that is being proposed, then

15   shouldn't other facility sizes be assessed in this

16   process?

17              We will be having improvements in -- like I                  IVANCIC-7
18   said, improved recycling; also improvements in

19   packaging, and that should be reflected in the

20   community's views.

21              Also, I don't have any problem, if we do a                   IVANCIC-8

 1   good discussion and assessment, of bringing in waste,                      IVANCIC-8 (cont.)
 2   which can be seen as a resource, from other counties,

 3   other states if that's the business this community wants

 4   to be in.   But they need to know the traffic, the

 5   pollution and the other effects of being in that

 6   business and choose to do it.

 8                JUDGE SHARER:   Jane Dunsmore.

 9                MS. DUNSMORE:   Good evening.    My name is

10   Jane Dunsmore, D-U-N-S-M-O-R-E.

11                I would like to call your attention to a                      DUNSMORE-1
12   website, reutersinternational.com, May 12th, 2010.        This

13   is an article about our near neighbor, Harrisburg,

14   Pennsylvania.   We will not go into the fact that they're

15   near bankruptcy and the problems they are having with

16   financing; we will only cover trashonomics, as the

17   paragraph was headed.

18                First of all, Harrisburg is not able to

19   generate enough trash in order to let their incinerator

20   make anything other than waste.    They are capable of

21   burning 800 tons, but they only are putting in about 656

 1   tons per day in March of 2010.    This causes a loss of                    DUNSMORE-1 (cont.)
 2   $300,000 to the city.

 3               In April, the local paper reported that                        DUNSMORE-2
 4   haulers are dumping at illegal sites in order to avoid

 5   tipping fees for leaving it at the incinerator.

 6   According to The Patriot-News, a County employee has

 7   been hired and paid $15.40 per hour to follow the trucks

 8   to make sure that they make it to the incinerator.

 9               If this isn't working very well for

10   Harrisburg, I don't think it's going to work very well

11   for us.

12               Thank you.

14               JUDGE SHARER:    Thank you.    Dennis Jung?

15               MR. JUNG:    Good evening.    My name is Dennis

16   Jung.   That's J-U-N-G, like Freud.

17               The report, the Frederick County MSP report,                   JUNG-1
18   says that it will burn acceptable materials, including

19   tires, sludge and perhaps hospital waste.      It was not

20   very detailed on that.    Hospital waste and these other

21   sources are all very rich sources of dioxins.

 1                I used to live in Columbus, Ohio, and this

 2   is like, as Yogi Berra would say, deja vu all over

 3   again.   In 1983, they opened up a WTE plant that was

 4   also promoted as being clean-burning and environmentally

 5   safe at the time, at the cost of only a hundred million

 6   dollars.   However, after the plant opened and started

 7   operation, residents of the downwind community, Grove

 8   City, Ohio, became concerned and found out that the

 9   dioxin levels by their schools and in their community

10   was many times greater than background.   Needless to

11   say, their property values didn't increase.

12                Columbus spent millions of dollars trying to

13   improve the separation process, trying to reduce the

14   emissions, dioxins, and also to improve the operation.

15   It didn't work.   One contract alone was $7 million.

16                In 1994, the dioxin levels represented about

17   two to three additional cancer deaths per every million

18   people exposed, according to the Ohio EPA.

19                In 1994, the plant was shuttered, and in

20   2005, the three smokestacks of the Central Ohio WTE were

21   imploded, ending a several-hundred-million-dollar

22




                                                      Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711
                                                                    48



 1   investment in the WTE.   The smokestack materials were at

 2   that point recycled.

 3               My concern and question is, how will the                      JUNG-2
 4   Frederick County WTE be monitored for emissions of

 5   dioxins and other toxins into the surrounding

 6   environment.   Not at the smokestack level, but outside.

 7   The dioxins can go through the process untouched; they

 8   can generate dioxins and also in the smokestack as they

 9   are going out they can be generated.

10               They're fat-soluble, so they're readily

11   absorbed and slowly eliminated from the body, so

12   long-term exposure is a problem.

13               As in the old computer adage Bill Gates

14   might use, garbage in, garbage out, and here the

15   question is, dioxin precursors in, how much is coming

16   out.

17               And as the plant is built, I believe that                     JUNG-3
18   air sampling should be performed by an independent

19   agency at designated sites, including schools in the

20   area around the plant before the plant becomes

 3   operators so they can manipulate the plant, samples

 4   should be taken to monitor revisions, and these reports

 5   should be made part of the public record to assure

 6   citizens of Frederick County that they're not being

 7   exposed to hazardous levels of toxins from the plant.

 8              Thank you.

10              JUDGE SHARER:    Greg Brown.

11              MR. BROWN:    Thank you.

12              My name is Greg Brown, and I have lived and

13   worked in Frederick County for over 25 years, and I'm                  BROWN-1
14   here to support the project, and I applaud Frederick

15   County and Carroll County for bringing the project

16   forward.

17              Listening to a lot of the other comments                    BROWN-2
18   going on, I feel that Frederick and Carroll County have

19   exhaustively studied the project for over five years and

20   concluded that this project is both environmentally

21   sound and cost-effective.

 1                 The project will provide significant local                   BROWN-3
 2   spending and jobs in Frederick, while increasing

 3   recycling and reducing our waste footprint by as much as

 4   90 percent.

 5                 I'm primarily concerned about the                            BROWN-4
 6   environment and future landfill problems.      The company I

 7   work for has worked around our local landfill, and I

 8   have the realization of what happens when you actually

 9   just bury all the things that we're talking about, and

10   my feeling is that by burying, it doesn't solve the

11   problem.

12                 Working in the construction industry, I see

13   the extreme amount of waste that we end up generating

14   that goes into our landfills, and understanding the

15   waste-to-energy possibility, can see that this is a much

16   better option than burying things in the landfill, and

17   by burying things, hope they just go away forever.        That

18   actually is not a fact.

19                 Thank you.

 1                MS. FORTON:   I give my name and my town, is

 2   that all, Mr. Speaker?

 5                This plan calls for burning recyclable                        FORTIN-1
 6   material at a time when all efforts should be directed

 7   toward recycling as much as possible.      Plans to increase

 8   recycling while sustaining a furnace that requires such

 9   an input cannot occur without Frederick becoming a local

10   dumping ground for trash from every surrounding suburban

11   area, as well as the cities of Baltimore, Washington and

12   beyond.   Calling it acceptable material does not change

13   the fact that it should be recycled, rather than burned.

14   Burning recyclables is just plain dumb and should not be

15   part of this plan.

16                More importantly, there is extremely little                   FORTIN-2
17   in the plan to help us avoid incineration as much as

18   possible.   The plan, as well as the project itself, is

19   designed to put the local government into the trash

20   business, at the opposition and extreme displeasure of

21   the taxpaying citizens who must breathe this air.

 1              The fact that this plan would burn                             FORTIN-3
 2   recyclable generic materials to me is a clear indication

 3   that this is an irrational approach which is clearly

 4   geared to make a business opportunity out of what is

 5   supposed to be a public service.

 6              The Materials Recovery Plan is yet another

 7   attempt to greenwash this project and perhaps an attempt

 8   to clean up its act by making it sound as though

 9   recyclables will be sorted at the facility.     However,

10   the plan does not call for that at all, and instead is

11   more like a laundry list of all the good recyclable

12   materials that it sees fit to burn.

13              I, for one, must protest and ask that the

14   plan be rewritten so as to make every attempt to presort

15   recyclables and send them to a recycling facility.

16              Thank you for your time.

17              JUDGE SHARER:    The lady here, Ms. Schmidt, I

 2   what this proportion is?   How is this liquid going to be

 3   eliminated according to the Material Separation Plan?

 5              JUDGE SHARER:    There is a gentleman in the

 6   back who came down a moment ago, and I'm having

 7   difficulty reading your name, but don't take it

 8   personally, because I can barely read my own most of the

 9   time.

10              MR. D'ALMALE:    Everybody has that problem.

11              My name is Mike D'Almale; I'm from

12   Johnsville, Maryland, which is in Frederick County.

13              The biggest fault I see in the planning                       ELMALEH-1
14   process is a common fault in long-term planning that I

15   have been involved with, and that is what I would call

16   the fallacy of fixed assumptions.

17              We try to plan ahead, look thirty years,

18   twenty years in advance, and we of course are using

19   assumptions about how things are done today.   That is a

20   very dangerous planning position to be in.

21              Specifically, when you look at the kind of                    ELMALEH-2
22




                                                       Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711

 1   waste stream that we have today versus what we probably                  ELMALEH-2 (cont.)
 2   will have thirty years in the future, I think we are

 3   looking at a dramatically different composition of that

 4   stream.   I think it's completely unrealistic to assume

 5   that the manufacturing process that now gives you the

 6   percentage breakdowns of recyclable, reusable,

 7   compostable and nonrecyclable, noncompostable,

 8   nonreusable percentages are going to stay the same over

 9   a thirty-year period.   Over a thirty-year period.     It's

10   simply unrealistic.

11                The manufacturing processes that are going

12   on today, the kind of research and development, the kind

13   of work in nanotechnology, biofuels and all kinds of

14   material engineering, are such that they are going to

15   move in the direction of greater recyclability, greater

16   reusability and less of the kind of composition, the

17   kind of waste composition that this plant basically says

18   it's going to be twenty, thirty years from now.    It is

19   absolutely laughable.

20                This is not good science.   This is not

21   realistic projection.   You have to take into account

22




                                                       Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMS.DOCX--012711

 1   what is going on in research and development, you have                  ELMALEH-2 (cont.)
 2   to look at long-term trends, not as they are today, but

 3   what they're likely to be in the future.

 4              Now, admittedly you cannot always determine

 5   what the future is going to look like, but in a highly

 6   dynamic environment where we're looking at significant

 7   changes in technology, it is foolish to commit yourself

 8   to a 19th-century technology.

 9              (Applause.)

10              And I have to say, with all due respect to

11   the staff and all the people who support this, you are

12   using static assumptions.   And it would be laughable if

13   it weren't so tragic.

14              Thank you.

15              JUDGE SHARER:    Thank you.

                         MATERIALS SEPARATION PLAN
                          COMMENTS AND RESPONSES
                  Public Meeting Transcript, August 30, 2010


The spelling of some of the commenters names have been corrected based on the sign-in
sheets collected at the public meeting.


DYSON-1: I have reviewed the Preliminary Draft Material Separation Plan for Frede-
          rick and Carroll County waste energy facility, and I agree with the plan
          set forth and with the ultimate destination of specific waste to the waste-
          to-energy facility in Frederick County.
Response:
Comments in support of the project noted for the record.


DYSON-2: Source separation promotes the removal of all designated recyclable mate-
          rials from the waste stream, and therefore helps to achieve high solid
          waste reduction rates.

              There is a Maryland Executive Order which states that each county will
              attain a 20 percent recycling goal. Frederick County's 2007 recycling rate
              was estimated to be at 41.32 percent, while Carroll County's 2007 recy-
              cling rate was estimated to be at 28.33.

              Although both counties are currently exceeding the 20 percent target, de-
              velopment of a formalized source separation program with additional
              reusable material separated before and after the waste energy
              process.[sic] This will increase those percentages, thereby reducing the
              counties' expenses for transportation of out-of-state solid waste, as well
              as reducing the associated environmental impact, greenhouse gas, for ex-
              ample.
Response:
Frederick and Carroll Counties have established a number of formal material separation
programs that are identified in Sections 3.2 (Frederick County) and 3.3 (Carroll County)
of the Material Separation Plan (MSP). The Energy Recovery Agreements (individually
signed by each County in July 2009 with the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Au-



                                           1                Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
thority [NEA]) do not restrict any County recycling programs or require the delivery of
solid waste that either County elects to include in a future recycling program.


DYSON-3: My experience has been with the studies done on background biological
         indicators, as the chemical uptake in vegetables, skin tissue of fish, cow's
         milk, as well as air monitoring of particulates and chemical deposition
         before the start of an incinerator project and one to two years after the
         start of a project.

              The results that I had access to showed that the biological indicators
              showed no increase or change to the chemical uptake from the baseline.
              The air monitoring showed that there was an increase in particulate de-
              position; however, it was still well below the federal regulatory limits.
              Chemical deposition did change; however, not significantly, and again,
              well below the federal regulatory limits.
Response:

DYSON-4: I encourage the Frederick and Carroll County commissions to move for-
          ward with the Material Separation Plan and with the waste energy facili-
          ty.
Response:
Comments in support of the project noted for the record.


IACCARINO-1: I have reviewed the draft of the Material Separation Plan for the
              Frederick and Carroll County renewable waste and energy facility.
              I agree with the goals and objectives of the draft plan for separat-
              ing components of the municipal solid waste stream and to make
              these separated components available for recycling before the post-
              recycling materials are processed by the WTE facility.

                    The reduction, reuse and recycling strategies described in the draft
                    plan indicate that a considerable amount of materials will be sepa-
                    rated, reused and recovered for recycling purposes.

IACCARINO-2: As an environmental professional with over thirty years of experience
              and a long-time resident of Frederick County, I believe the WTE fa-

                   solid waste problems.

                   The WTE facility is a prudent process for the safe disposal of post-
                   recycled municipal solid waste and will result in the generation of
                   clean, renewable energy.
Response:
Comments in support of the project noted for the record.


IACCARINO-3: From an environmental standpoint, the WTE facility will be equipped
              with state-of-the-art air pollution control technology and meet all
              federal and State emission limits and ambient air quality standards.
Response:
Comment noted for the record. The proposed Frederick/Carroll County Renewable
Waste-to-Energy Facility (FCCRWTE or Facility) will be required to have advanced air
emission controls. FCCRWTE will meet all applicable emission limits, and the impacts
of the Facility's emissions will meet all federal and state emission limits and ambient air
quality standards. An air quality permit application describing these controls, as well as
predicted impacts on air quality, is being prepared and is expected to be submitted to the
Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) early in 2011. The permit application
will be publically noticed and available for review and comment.


IACCARINO-4: The WTE project will also result in reduced generation of green-
              house gas emissions which would otherwise be generated from the
              equivalent generation of electricity up to 55 megawatts, the green-
              house gas emissions associated with transportation of municipal
              solid waste to other out-of-state landfills, and the subsequent gen-
              eration of methane, a greenhouse gas associated with the landfil-
              ling of municipal solid waste.

This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal

RAK-1: I have not reviewed the entire document, but I notice that there was an omis-
        sion. Section 2.1 says, "Additional waste from outside of the primary service
        area will be accepted to enable the Frederick/Carroll County renewable
        waste energy facility to operate at its designed capacity."

                                            3                 Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
        I think that is that it must be accepted in order to allow it to operate as its de-
        sign capacity, and the draft for material separation is missing the informa-
        tion for the other trash that will be imported.
Response:
The purpose of this preliminary Draft MSP is to identify the goals and approaches for
separating certain components of the municipal solid waste stream in the Frederick and
Carroll Counties' service areas to make the separated materials available for recycling.
The nonrecycled Acceptable Material will be processed at NEA's FCCRWTE.


Additional solid waste will be required for FCCRWTE to operate at its design capacity.
The Frederick and Carroll Counties' Energy Recovery Agreements (individually signed
in July 2009 with NEA) require that NEA be provided written direction by both Counties
prior to receiving Acceptable Waste from outside the Counties' service area. The Final
Draft MSP will be modified to incorporate this information.


TWIGG-1: In 2.1, in the service areas, it mentions that additional waste from outside
          of the primary service area will be accepted to enable the facility to oper-
          ate at its design capacity. And if you look at figure 2.1 in the chart there,
          it shows by 2025, the projected amount of waste will be approximately
          390,000 tons, and that's before you separate out the recoverable mate-
          rials.

              I did a little bit of math on that, and it still doesn't come to 1,500 tons a
              day, so it's obvious that they must take solid waste from other areas to
              enable the plant to operate at peak capacity in order to achieve that 55
              megawatts that the plant will generate.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. Figure 2-1 was revised for the Final Draft with updated Carroll County
solid waste and recycling projections. The revised Figure 2-1 now shows the 2025 pro-
jected amount of processible solid waste from Frederick and Carroll Counties is approx-
imately 317,900 tons. In addition, sewage sludge and tires will be processed at
FCCRWTE. Processible solid waste is defined as waste that was not recycled and is
available to process at FCCRWTE. In this same revised figure, in 2025, approximately



                                            4                 Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
302,800 tons of Frederick and Carroll County Maryland Recycling Act (MRA) tons are
expected to be recycled.


Please refer to the response to RAK-1.


TWIGG-2: I found the point to be vague; there was not much detail on transporting
          this waste from the transport area to the facility at the McKenney
          [McKinney] site. I'm very concerned about that and the traffic that that
          will generate in that area. There is really a very large lack of detail in this
          draft.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. The purpose of this Preliminary Draft MSP is to identify the goals and
approaches for separating certain components of the municipal solid waste stream in the
Frederick and Carroll Counties' service areas to make the separated materials available
for recycling. A traffic study will be prepared to evaluate the impact of FCCRWTE as
part of the Frederick County development review process.


TWIGG-3: I would also like to see the studies the County performed in alternative me-
          thods. I don't think we have seen those, and I would like to have those
          somewhere public.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. The Frederick County Board of County Commissioners had a number of
studies completed to consider alternatives. These studies can be found on the respective
County's      Web          site   under      Frederick      County            Waste-to-Energy

TWIGG-4: And some of the speakers before me mentioned about the materials being
          discharged to the air, and all plants that burn create dioxins, and science



                                             5                Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
              just doesn't know yet what the effects of those dioxins are on people; they
              can only guess.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. A siting analysis will be prepared as part of the MDE air permit applica-
tion that will analyze the impact of the FCCRWTE on ambient air quality, visibility,
soils, and vegetation. The siting analysis will consider air pollution control alternatives
that minimize, on a site-specific basis and to the maximum extent practicable, potential
risks to the public health or the environment.


TWIGG-5: I am strongly opposed to this plant, and I think this draft report is poorly
          written and lacking in detail.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. Comment opposing the project noted for the record. The purpose of this
Preliminary Draft MSP is to identify the goals and approaches for separating certain
components of the municipal solid waste stream in the Frederick and Carroll Counties'
service areas to make the separated materials available for recycling. The level of detail
provided in the Preliminary Draft MSP satisfies or exceeds the regulatory requirements.


TOME-1: If the purpose of this plan, as stated on page 1-1 is to identify the goals and
          approaches for separating certain components of the municipal waste
          stream in both Frederick and Carroll Counties in order to make the sepa-
          rated materials available for recycling, then why aren't we looking at max-
          imizing that amount of material in the first place?
Response:
Frederick and Carroll Counties have established a number of formal material separation
programs that are identified in Sections 3.2 (Frederick County) and 3.3 (Carroll County)
of the Preliminary Draft MSP. Additional information can be found on each county's
Web site.


The latest data provided by MDE's County's Recyclables by Commodity in Tons for Ca-
lendar Year 2009 report shows Frederick County had a waste diversion rate of



                                             6                Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
46.63 percent while Carroll County had a waste diversion rate of 42.05 percent1. Calen-
dar Year 2008 data provided by the Counties showed Frederick County with a waste di-
version rate of 44.4 percent, while Carroll County had a waste diversion rate of
37.9 percent. MDE defines the waste diversion rate as the sum of the recycling rate and
the source reduction credit (based on voluntary reporting of source reduction activities).
Both counties exceed the MRA requirement of 20 percent.


TOME-2: In an email from County Attorney John Mathias -- in an email from the
        County Attorney, John Mathias stated, "The BOCC may impose conditions
        on a hauler's use of a County facility such as a County sanitary landfill or
        transfer station, but these conditions would not apply if the hauler chose
        not to use the County facility."

                Continuing, he stated, "The BOCC is provided authority in State law to
                prescribe rules for the use of County solid waste facilities. These rules pro-
                vide that only haulers providing only certain services, such as curbside re-
                cycling and pickup to its customers would be licensed to use the County fa-
                cilities. Those rules would only apply to those haulers who use the County
                facilities," end quote.

                A friend of mine has referred to this as "my landfill, my rules." Since
                tiered pricing programs, which treat trash and recycling disposal in the
                same way that utilities do -- in other words, you pay only for what you
                throw out in the trash, the recycling charge is also included in that price.
                Since these programs have been shown to drastically reduce the amount of
                waste that has to be disposed of in a community, why wouldn't the authori-
                ty first recommend this strategy? Granted, it would involve sitting down
                with the haulers in our county and working out a renewable program. It
                would also involve having the County step back a bit from what they view
                as a costly recycling program and in turn give the opportunity to our local
                private businesses for hauling.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. Legislative authority for a pilot Pay As You Throw (PAYT) program did
not exist until October 1, 2010. The 2010 Board of County Commissioners stated that the
construction and implementation of a PAYT pilot be a decision made by the next elected
Board. The new Board was sworn in on December 1, 2010.

TOME-3: Since the County has been given the authority to develop the best type of
          recycling and disposal program, why was this never identified with the
          other options on page 4-1 as an alternate solid waste disposal option?
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. Please refer to the response to TOME-2.


TOME-4: On page 1-3 of the plan, it states, "The recognized benefits of reducing the
        MSW stream through recycling include a reduction in transportation costs,
        a reduction in the amount of disposal fees to the citizens due to reduced vo-
        lumes, and an increase in the longevity of the life of the local landfill. Most
        importantly, by actively supporting recycling efforts, the Counties and the
        authority, NEA, are preserving valuable resources."

            If this is truly what the Authority is all about, then why doesn't the service
            contract state that the facility will not burn valuable recyclable material?
            Or could it be that this plan is just what many people are referring to as
            window dressing.
Response:
Solid waste that is not recycled will be combusted at FCCRWTE. The Frederick and
Carroll Counties' Energy Recovery Agreements (individually signed in July 2009 with
NEA) state under Recitals 3, "The County has determined to provide for the conversion
into energy of solid waste that is not recycled using capacity at a regional resource re-
covery facility (the "Facility"). Nothing in this Agreement restricts any County recycling
programs or requires the delivery by the County to the Facility of solid waste that the
County elects to include in a recycling program" (emphasis added). The Final Draft MSP
will be modified to include this information.


TOME-5: Another question I had, I wanted to make one comment, that 20 percent of
          waste recyclables is pitiful, in my opinion. That's just way too low. I know
          that's not an argument with the plan. It's just my opinion.
Response:
Please refer to the response to TOME-1.

TOME-6: It also says that we're -- you say that they are counting these MRA's as re-
          cyclable material. So why are we going to burn them when we're already
          recycling them? And does that mean that we are going to burn other ma-
          terial that (inaudible.)
Response:
Please refer to the response to TOME-4,


CUBIT-1: I also work at the library, and I would like to comment on the lack of trans-
          parency in the document and I also would like to comment on the inability
          of the common citizen to have access to this document.

             I know it's at the authority's website. I went there myself. You cannot print
             off that website. You can download that document to a computer. You
             cannot print off of that computer. If I wanted to circulate this document, I
             would have to -- I don't have a copy. I would have to go to the library,
             print a copy and then circulate it that way.

             This is lack of access, as far as I'm concerned. In a day when everyone
             has access to a computer and a printer and should be concerned about this
             big monstrosity that's coming to our county, we should all have access to
             this.
Response:
A printable electronic copy of the public notice and the Preliminary Draft MSP was add-
ed to NEA's Web site immediately after the public meeting. A hard copy of the notice
and the report were available at eight Frederick County libraries and six Carroll County
libraries prior to the July 30, 2010, public notice.


CUBIT-2: I would also like to follow up on Mr. Twigg's comment about the ineffec-
          tuality of the document itself. There is a lot of words on it. I didn't see an-
          ything of substance. I saw the numbers. We have things to disagree with.
          We would like to see the numbers behind the assumptions made in a lot of
          parts of this document.
Response:
Waste generation projections using County-approved numbers for Frederick and Carroll
Counties were obtained from NEA's planning model. Typically, as the population in-
creases, so does the amount of waste generated, even if the per capita waste generation
rate plateaus and does not increase.



                                               9             Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
CUBIT-3: I think the whole process has been like this, in that it gives the community
          as little as possible and let's just sneak this project by as fast as we can.
Response:
Frederick County Board of County Commissioners and Carroll County Board of Com-
missioners held numerous meetings and public hearings over the last 5 years in evaluat-
ing the solid waste management options. Detailed reports and information can be found
the Counties' government Web sites and the NEA Web site.


BURRUSS-1: I object to the term "thermally processed." I think the correct word is
            "burned." That's what most people will understand.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. FCCRWTE will combust solid waste, which is the process of burning a
fuel to produce thermal energy. The use of the term "thermally processed" describes the
controlled nature of the combustion process in the combustors. "Burned" would also be
an acceptable term for the combustion process.


BURRUSS-2: The table, figure 2-1 that we saw on the screen earlier, does indicate, as
            a previous speaker mentioned, that in the year 2025 it is projected that
            there will be from Frederick County 575 tons per day of fuel for the
            plant and 411 tons per day from Carroll County, for a total of 986
            tons. This leaves a deficit, according to your figures, of 514 tons per
            day in the 1500 tons per day capacity of the facility. So it's built into
            the plan as presented here that there clearly has to transport from oth-
            er jurisdictions in order to operate the plant at anywhere near its peak
            efficiency.
Response:
Figure 2-1 was revised for the Final Draft with updated Carroll County waste and recy-
cling projections. The revised Figure 2-1 shows in the year 2025 approximately 212,000
and 105,680 tons of processible solid waste from Frederick and Carroll Counties, respec-
tively, will be available to FCCRWTE. The total processible solid waste is approximately
72 percent of Annual Throughput Guarantee (first year) required of the Service Contract.
Additional solid waste will be required to meet the design capacity of FCCRWTE.


Please refer to the response to RAK-1 for additional information.

                                           10                Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
BURRUSS-3: On page 3.1, at the very bottom, continuing onto page 3.2, it states,
           "The Frederick County Commissioners have established a waste divi-
           sion [diversion] goal that the material removed from the waste stream
           for recycling, composting or other strategies, including source reduc-
           tion, of 60 percent by the year 2025." I presume those figures, then,
           were based on including that 60 percent figure.

                 I think we should take into account the possibility that future Boards
                 of County Commissioners could very well take a more aggressive
                 stance toward that reduction through more recycling from residential
                 and business and industry and reducing the waste stream considerably
                 by recycling and composting of food wastes from institutions, restau-
                 rants, grocery stores and so forth, so that the more the waste stream is
                 reduced, the less is going to be left to burn. I mean, this is just com-
                 mon sense. And so it is inevitable that we're going to importing more
                 and more fuel for the plant.
Response:
The MRA Diversion Rate of 73 percent for Frederick County and 55 percent for Carroll
County was assumed for the year 2025. This MRA Diversion rate includes FCCRWTE
recycling of metals and ash and includes a County source reduction credit of 5 percent.
As previously mentioned, 2009 Frederick and Carroll Counties MRA diversion rates are
46.63 and 42.05 percent, respectively.


BURRUSS-4: One of the other handouts prior to this meeting indicated there was a
            list of several things that would be accomplished by building the facili-
            ty, and one of them, which may seem ridiculous, but it was stated, an-
            yway, was that this plant would help Frederick County become ener-
            gy-independent. It would be extremely ironic if Frederick County were
            to become energy-independent, but trash-dependent.

           trash from other areas is accepted. In other words, it's printed, it's
           there, it's welcome. It's not -- this program before, I thought, was li-
           mited to Carroll County and Frederick County. This specifically opens
           the door to other counties and other areas, which, again, I think is in-
           teresting.
Response:
The Frederick and Carroll Counties' Energy Recovery Agreements (individually signed
in July 2009 with NEA) require that NEA be provided written direction by both Counties
prior to receiving solid waste from outside the Counties' service area.


HANSON-3: But I also am very concerned about what Ellis Burris [Burruss] was
          talking about before this, which is compromising the recycle program
          by this, what he was talking about, if they don't meet the needs for max-
          imizing the electric production, to look outside of Carroll and Frederick
          counties.
Response:
Please refer to the response to BURRUSS-3.


HANSON-4: I'm concerned that they will also use more of the resources, recycled re-
           sources, which obviously their higher and best use is to keep them in
           production and in use and manufacture, rather than burning them, but
           those also specifically are not eliminated from this process.
Response:
Please refer to the response to TOME-1 for current MRA Diversion rates and BUR-
RUSS-3 for projected MRA Diversion rates.


HANSON-5: I also am concerned with the elected public officials talking about, and I

           that this facility will be offering to Frederick County residents and the
           pay scales and the educational levels that those jobs will require, just
           for comparison to, say, a resource recovery farm or something like that.

ANDREWS-1: I think the comment on page 3-10 needs to be further elaborated if
            you're going to make mention of it, and specifically, there should be
            a link to the recommendations that were put forth from the Environ-
            mental Advisory Council in October of 2007. Those recommends can
            be found at ccgovernment.carr.org/cpg/eac/recommend.pdm.[correct
            link is http://ccgovernment.carr.org/ccg/eac/recommend.pdf]
Response:
The correct link to the October 2007 Carroll County Environmental Advisory Council
recommendations is noted. The comment is noted for the record, and the link has been
added to the Final Draft MSP.


ANDREWS-2: First, the council recommended that Carroll County change the para-
            digm from solid waste management to resource management. That
            would involve elevating recycling as the driving element of resource
            management, one, by creating and verifying recycling reporting poli-
            cies, and two, by managing its own system in order to direct recycled
            goods to specific recovery centers, and three, by increasing funding to
            recycling operations for expanded public education efforts. The board
            also recommended that the Board of County Commissioners view
            public education and behavior modification as essential in the transi-
            tion to the new paradigm of resource management. This will require
            staff and media attention as needed. Again, the board -- or the coun-
            cil also recommended not supporting the plan for the construction of
            this waste-to-energy facility, but, rather, that the County's efforts di-
            rect its resource management strategy as outlined above, or as I have
            described, for a period of five years. The council also recommended
            that the Board of Commissioners implement and support pay-as-you-
            throw trash collection programs and the commission, the EAC, to
            work in concert with the Department of Public Works to create a
            community process to begin or to design essential elements of that
            program. The council also recommended that the Board of Commis-
            sioners of Carroll County undertake a feasibility study of creating a
            countywide composting facility where organic material could be
            turned back into useful products for local farmers and reduce green-
            house gases. In closing, I just wanted to make everyone aware of
            those recommendations and that they be referenced in this plan.

WEST-1: I, too, have read this report from cover to cover, and I couldn't help but
          wonder what this Material Separation Plan had to do with waste energy
          incineration.
Response:
This preliminary draft MSP fulfills one of the requirements of Title 40 of the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 60, Subpart Eb, New Source Performance Standards
(NSPS) for FCCRWTE. The standard also prescribes a specific process that must be fol-
lowed to ensure the opportunity for public review and comment on the preliminary draft
MSP. The process consists of the following:
      ·     Preparation and issuance of a preliminary draft MSP for public comment.
      ·     Notification of a public meeting for accepting oral and written comments on
            the preliminary draft MSP.
      ·     Acceptance of written comments on the preliminary draft MSP.
      ·     Preparation of written responses to any public comments.
      ·     Identification of the location(s) where written responses to public comment.


WEST-2: In my opinion, recycling and waste-to-energy are competing for the same
          resources. They're in direct competition. And I must say that I am severely
          underwhelmed by my county, Carroll County's, efforts when it comes to
          recycling. There is no incentives for the residents, there is no commercial
          program, no composting of food waste. Frankly, I view it as a lack of lea-
          dership.
Response:
Please refer to the response to TOME-1 for current MRA Diversion rates and BUR-
RUSS-3 for projected MRA Diversion rates.


WEST-3: And within the media, within the Material Separation Plan, there is a table
         on page 1-1 that talks about the Frederick and Carroll County Solid Waste
         Management Plan, and under Carroll County it says, "The effective im-
         plementation of an integrated system of solid waste management and recy-


                                          14                Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
            cling that will allow sufficient flexibility to react to changes in regulation,
            technology and market conditions."

            I guess my question is, how does a thirty-year agreement with this waste
            energy facility meet those criteria?
Response:
An integrated system of solid waste management includes provisions for recycling, re-
source recovery (waste-to-energy), waste transfer and disposal. A waste-to-energy facili-
ty provides a long-term solid waste disposal option, for waste that is not recycled, that
meets current and future disposal needs, generates clean renewable energy, and is com-
patible with recycling and metal recovery programs.


WEST-4: In closing, I view this evening's effort as a bit disingenuous. My question of
          the EPA and the Maryland Department of the Environment is simply, is
          your mission to protect the health of our citizens and the environment of
          our state, or to protect the health of waste management and the environ-
          ment for these big industries?
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. FCCRWTE is required to obtain a number of permits associated with
refuse disposal, sewage sludge utilization, tire-derived fuel use, wastewater discharge,
and air emissions from MDE. During the MDE permit review process, these permit ap-
plications will be available for public review and comment. Comment noted for the

REAVER-1: I would just like to say I'm in support of this project. A majority of our
           Frederick County commissioners have joined with a majority of Carroll
           County commissioners to craft a plan after more than five years of study
           that includes the best long-term options for the waste reduction, recy-
           cling and dependable, cost-competitive renewable waste energy technol-
           ogy that has successfully served other communities in Maryland, the
           United States and the world.

               Many communities fail to plan for their future needs and invest in their
               long-term infrastructure. Our county leaders have done their homework
               and set a responsible course of action that is safe, sustainable and will
               solve our trash problem.



                                           15                 Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
                The County's plan for recycling renewable waste energy as reflected in
                the Material Separation Plan has my support. I would encourage others
                to consider the benefits of this project.
Response:
Comments in support of the project noted for the record.


SNYDER-1: First I would like to mention that in this plan that's referenced, on page
           4-1, they talk about the solid waste options for Frederick County being
           the construction of a composting facility to process residues long-hauled
           out of Frederick County for disposal.

                Some of us -- and I'm involved with an environmental group -- some of
                us would ask why wasn't a large-scale source separating composting fa-
                cility concerned?
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. This alternate solid waste disposal option was considered in 2005 and was
determined not to be as cost effective as waste-to-energy. Further information can be
found      on   Frederick    County's     Web     site     under     Waste         to      Energy
(http://www.frederickcountymd.gov/index.aspx?nid=3208 [accessed January 11, 2011]).


SNYDER-2: Basically, I think it's important -- from what I know, the plans for this
           waste-to-energy, this incinerator to burn trash, these plans were made
           way before the remarkable use in recycling rates offered to Frederick
           City, especially since we began the single stream process. And such a
           cost, with those possible dangers that are unknown, made before we
           have this new information, need to be reconsidered.
Response:
The Frederick County (which includes Frederick City) single-stream recycling program is
an integral part of the solid waste management program that includes the waste-to-energy
project.


SORBELLO-1: My concerns regarding the Authority's Draft Materials Separation
            Plan include, but are not limited to the following: Trends docu-
            mented in reports from the Covanta incinerator in Montgomery
            County, Maryland, have shown that, A, increased recycling decreas-
            es the quantity of materials available for incineration, and B, source
            reduction and recycling of materials such as paper and plastic dimi-

                                           16                 Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
                  nishes the energy value of incineration, which reduces the electrical
                  generating capability of the facility.

                  In other words, as other speakers have said, recycling and incinera-
                  tion are not compatible. They directly compete with each other, both
                  materially and financially. I don't believe our county can afford a
                  comprehensive recycling program if we are spending tens of millions
                  of dollars a year to subsidize the incinerator operation and we can-
                  not produce enough electricity for incineration if we are recycling
                  effectively.
Response:
Communities nationwide using waste-to-energy have an aggregate recycling rate at least
5 percentage points above the national average (Recycling and Waste-to-Energy Are
They Compatible? 2009 Update Governmental Advisory Associates, Inc., Eileen Brettler
Berenyi, June 2009). This is true in Maryland as Baltimore, Harford, and Montgomery
Counties have the some of the highest MDE waste diversion rates (MDE 2009 data:
42.94, 62.03, and 47.04 percent, respectively). The Final Draft MSP will be revised to
emphasize this point.


SORBELLO-2: Also, I'm concerned that there is no separation of material at the inci-
             nerator. Any milk jug or aluminum cans or paper or plastic that ar-
             rives at the plant will be burned. Also, any recovered ferrous metal is
             retrieved by use of magnets to pull them out of the ash after burning.
             I believe that these materials can be recovered without the incinera-
             tor.
Response:
FCCRWTE is a mass-burn type waste­to-energy facility that directly combusts the deli-
vered solid waste. This type of facility works effectively with single-stream recycling
programs as the majority of recyclables are removed from the collected solid waste
stream before it is sent to the waste-to-energy facility. FCCRWTE will also recycle met-
als and ash that would otherwise be landfilled. Recovered metal volumes will depend on
the amount of metals remaining in the MSW delivered to FCCRWTE.


SORBELLO-3: I also find it troubling on the authority website in the About Us sec-
             tion, there is an image of recyclable materials, cans, bottles, et cetera,
             which are twirled around, and then they become a light bulb. I think
             this is really implying that it's preferable to burn these materials for


                                          17                Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
                  a small amount of energy recovery, rather than recycle them in order
                  to save energy. Recycling saves three to five times the amount of
                  energy that incinerators produce when you look at the life cycle of
                  these materials.
Response:
Comment noted for the record.


SORBELLO-4: Also, on page 3-8 of the Draft Material Separation Plan, it states that
             tires will be brought to the facility for burning, rather than being re-
             cycled.

                  The environmental community discourages under any circumstances
                  the use of tires as fuel. Burning tires is extremely polluting. In tests
                  all around the country there have been increases in air pollution as a
                  direct result of tire incineration. There have been increases in mer-
                  cury, lead, zinc, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, arsenic and ben-
                  zine [benzene]. These compounds are carcinogenic. Mercury from
                  tire burning is linked to brain, lung, kidney damage, reproductive
                  problems and death. Very young children and the unborn are espe-
                  cially vulnerable to these effects.

                  Tires can be utilized instead for an almost unlimited range of crea-
                  tive uses, including auto parts, playground equipment, sound bar-
                  riers, railroad ties and tennis courts. Burning tires for limited energy
                  production which results in ash and air pollution is the lowest use of
                  scrap tires.
Response:
Tires will be combusted at FCCRWTE as permitted by MDE Tire-Derived Fuel Facility
Approval Permit and will meet the permitted air quality emission rates defined by the
MDE Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)/Air Permit to Construct.


SORBELLO-5: Also, I want to just reiterate, other people have said that due to the
             fact that the proposed incinerator requires approximately 1500 tons
             per day of material, which is almost twice what Frederick and Car-
             roll Counties are currently producing, we will have to import from
             other counties, and probably other states as well. Trash truck traffic
             will cause pollution, clogging our roads and our lungs for decades to
             come.

IVANCIC-1: I'm thinking also that the 20 percent may be a State standard, but it is
            not sufficient. It should be brought up as a floor revenue and ceiling.
            We can reach much higher than that, and we should, and our plans
            should reflect that.
Response:
Please refer to the response to TOME-1 .


IVANCIC-2: Also, I want to also say it is difficult to access this report, because it's not
            printable. We had two people trying to download it; we could not down-
            load it at home. We could not copy from it, so a friend who was trying
            to do written comments could not just copy what he was trying to com-
            ment on and just paste it into a comment. And that, in 2010, is absurd.
Response:
Please refer to the response to CUBIT-1.


IVANCIC-3: Because the current census will show different growth rates for this
            area, the presentation of the next version should take that updated data
            into consideration. Assumptions about what amount of wastes are
            available are key to figuring out what size this plant should be and
            would really need to use updated information on what the growth rates
            are and how much we can expect in increased recycling.

                Figure 2.1 estimates those growth rates, and that's going to be out of
                date as soon as the new census information comes out.

                lation, that's not true.

IVANCIC-4: There is no appendix, such as what was expressed, I explained that stan-
            dards referenced should be either linked to so that you can efficiently
            link to them, or they should be listed as an appendix.
Response:
Information links are provided throughout the Preliminary Draft MSP.


IVANCIC-5: There is no footnotes, so we're not able to tell where this information is
            coming from and to check it or to see what criticisms may have already
            been established for some of the sources of the information. There is no
            mention of reviewing any other alternatives, such as waste fields.
Response:
Information links are provided throughout the Preliminary Draft MSP.


IVANCIC-6: Also, analysis of the size of the facility. If we are going to recycle more
            and cannot efficiently use the size of facility that is being proposed,
            then shouldn't other facility sizes be assessed in this process?
Response:
Please refer to the response to TWIGG-3.


IVANCIC-7: We will be having improvements in -- like I said, improved recycling; al-
            so improvements in packaging, and that should be reflected in the

IVANCIC-8: Also, I don't have any problem, if we do a good discussion and assess-
            ment, of bringing in waste, which can be seen as a resource, from other
            counties, other states if that's the business this community wants to be
            in. But they need to know the traffic, the pollution and the other effects
            of being in that business and choose to do it.

DUNSMORE-1: I would like to call your attention to a website, reutersinternation-
             al.com, May 12th, 2010. This is an article about our near neighbor,
             Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. We will not go into the fact that they're
             near bankruptcy and the problems they are having with financing;
             we will only cover trashonomics, as the paragraph was headed.

                   First of all, Harrisburg is not able to generate enough trash in or-
                   der to let their incinerator make anything other than waste. They
                   are capable of burning 800 tons, but they only are putting in about
                   656 tons per day in March of 2010. This causes a loss of $300,000
                   to the city.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. The purpose of this preliminary Draft MSP is to identify the goals and
approaches for separating certain components of the municipal solid waste stream in the
Frederick and Carroll Counties' service areas to make the separated materials available
for recycling. This comment is not relevant to the MSP.


DUNSMORE-2: In April, the local paper reported that haulers are dumping at illegal
             sites in order to avoid tipping fees for leaving it at the incinerator.
             According to The Patriot-News, a County employee has been hired
             and paid $15.40 per hour to follow the trucks to make sure that they
             make it to the incinerator.

                   If this isn't working very well for Harrisburg, I don't think it's
                   going to work very well for us.

JUNG-1: The report, the Frederick County MSP report, says that it will burn accepta-

            very detailed on that. Hospital waste and these other sources are all very
            rich sources of dioxins.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. Infectious/medical waste is not accepted as a processible waste at
FCCRWTE.


JUNG-2: My concern and question is, how will the Frederick County WTE be moni-
        tored for emissions of dioxins and other toxins into the surrounding envi-
        ronment. Not at the smoke-stack level, but outside. The dioxins can go
        through the process untouched; they can generate dioxins and also in the
        smokestack as they are going out they can be generated.

            They're fat-soluble, so they're readily absorbed and slowly eliminated from
            the body, so long-term exposure is a problem.

            As in the old computer adage Bill Gates might use, garbage in, garbage
            out, and here the question is, dioxin precursors in, how much is coming
            out.
Response:

JUNG-3: And as the plant is built, I believe that air sampling should be performed by
          an independent agency at designated sites, including schools in the area
          around the plant before the plant becomes operational to establish a base-
          line mode of dioxin and other toxins that will be released by the process,
          and then on a routine basis at times not known to the operators so they can
          manipulate the plant, samples should be taken to monitor revisions, and
          these reports should be made part of the public record to assure citizens of
          Frederick County that they're not being exposed to hazardous levels of tox-
          ins from the plant.

          things that we're talking about, and my feeling is that by burying, it
          doesn't solve the problem.

              Working in the construction industry, I see the extreme amount of waste
              that we end up generating that goes into our landfills, and understanding
              the waste-to-energy possibility, can see that this is a much better option
              than burying things in the landfill, and by burying things, hope they just
              go away forever. That actually is not a fact.

FORTIN-1: This plan calls for burning recyclable material at a time when all efforts
           should be directed toward recycling as much as possible. Plans to in-
           crease recycling while sustaining a furnace that requires such an input
           cannot occur without Frederick becoming a local dumping ground for
           trash from every surrounding suburban area, as well as the cities of Bal-
           timore, Washington and beyond. Calling it acceptable material does not

               change the fact that it should be recycled, rather than burned. Burning
               recyclables is just plain dumb and should not be part of this plan.
Response:
Please refer to the response to TOME-4.


FORTIN-2: More importantly, there is extremely little in the plan to help us avoid in-
           cineration as much as possible. The plan, as well as the project itself, is
           designed to put the local government into the trash business, at the op-
           position and extreme displeasure of the taxpaying citizens who must
           breathe this air.
Response:
Please refer to the response to DUNSMORE-1.


FORTIN-3: The fact that this plan would burn recyclable generic materials to me is a
           clear indication that this is an irrational approach which is clearly
           geared to make a business opportunity out of what is supposed to be a
           public service.

               The Materials Recovery Plan is yet another attempt to greenwash this
               project and perhaps an attempt to clean up its act by making it sound as
               though recyclables will be sorted at the facility. However, the plan does
               not call for that at all, and instead is more like a laundry list of all the
               good recyclable materials that it sees fit to burn.

               I, for one, must protest and ask that the plan be rewritten so as to make
               every attempt to presort recyclables and send them to a recycling facility.

Please refer to the response to TOME-4.


SCHMIDT-1: Currently, our solid waste contains a significant proportion of liquid.
            Could you tell us what this proportion is? How is this liquid going to
            be eliminated according to the Material Separation Plan?
Response:
The MSP does not determine acceptable and unacceptable waste; that will be determined
by the air and refuse disposal permits.

ELMALEH-1: The biggest fault I see in the planning process is a common fault in
            long-term planning that I have been involved with, and that is what I
            would call the fallacy of fixed assumptions.

                 We try to plan ahead, look thirty years, twenty years in advance, and
                 we of course are using assumptions about how things are done today.
                 That is a very dangerous planning position to be in.
Response:
Comment noted for the record.


ELMALEH-2: Specifically, when you look at the kind of waste stream that we have
            today versus what we probably will have thirty years in the future, I
            think we are looking at a dramatically different composition of that
            stream. I think it's completely unrealistic to assume that the manu-
            facturing process that now gives you the percentage breakdowns of
            recyclable, reusable, compostable and nonrecyclable, noncomposta-
            ble, nonreusable percentages are going to stay the same over a thirty-
            year period. Over a thirty-year period. It's simply unrealistic.

                 The manufacturing processes that are going on today, the kind of re-
                 search and development, the kind of work in nanotechnology, biofu-
                 els and all kinds of material engineering, are such that they are going
                 to move in the direction of greater recyclability, greater reusability
                 and less of the kind of composition, the kind of waste composition
                 that this plant basically says it's going to be twenty, thirty years from
                 now. It is absolutely laughable.

                 This is not good science. This is not realistic projection. You have to
                 take into account what is going on in research and development, you
                 have to look at long-term trends, not as they are today, but what
                 they're likely to be in the future.

                 Now, admittedly you cannot always determine what the future is
                 going to look like, but in a highly dynamic environment where we're
                 looking at significant changes in technology, it is foolish to commit
                 yourself to a 19th-century technology.

                 And I have to say, with all due respect to the staff and all the people
                 who support this, you are using static assumptions. And it would be
                 laughable if it weren't so tragic.

                    WRITTEN COMMENTS RECEIVED
                                 Harvey Alter Letter


ALTER-1: Existing Operations: As described in Chapter 2 of the draft report, Frede-
          rick County currently has an extensive system of recyclables collection
          from households and maintains 11 drop-off locations. I suggest these
          11 locations are problematical because of difficulty in maintaining clean-
          liness and discipline and the success of the single stream collection and
          the recycling operations on Reichs Ford Road.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. Due to the rural nature of the County, the drop-off locations provide a
convenient and effective way to collect recyclables and are an integral part of the solid
waste management program in Frederick County.


ALTER-2: The draft MSP should address that the landfills operating in Frederick
          County are insufficient for the long-term sanitary disposal of MSW. Ap-
          parently, the same is true for Carroll County.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. The purpose of this preliminary Draft MSP is to identify the goals and
approaches for separating certain components of the municipal solid waste stream in the
Frederick and Carroll Counties' service areas to make the separated materials available
for recycling.


ALTER-3: MSW Quantities and Projections: Clearly, MSW generation is proportion-
          al to population. However, the usual practice of quoting per capita gener-
          ation is misleading and often wrong. Such calculations include all MSW
          and mislead lay audiences to think that each person, in each household,
          actually generates that much waste. Franklin & Franklin in their various
          reports and updates to EPA on MSW generation in the United States,
          going back to shortly after passage of RCRA (1976), pointed out that the

                                           26               Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
             household portion of MSW ranges from 45 to 55 weight percent. This
             number is repeated in the most recent update report. Moreover, careful
             reading (and my past conversations with Bill and Marge Franklin) de-
             scribes the methodology for assembling generation numbers. The Fran-
             klins used input-output analyses and reported waste generation as the dif-
             ference between the two. Such numbers have little relation to the waste
             deposited at a disposal facility.

             Moreover, when the input-output data were not available, updates were
             linear extrapolations of past years. From time to time, the Franklins
             checked their estimates by sampling curbside waste or waste brought to
             disposal facilities. However, such analyses provide one datum point on the
             spectrum of time. It is well established, and a subject of textbooks that the
             amount of MSW collected in a community varies with the day of the week
             and the season. In short, a large grain of salt must be used with any re-
             port or projection of quantity or composition.
Response:
Comment noted for the record.


ALTER-4: At the same time, trends over the last decade or so are clear that packaging
          is being light-weighted and decreasing as a fraction of MSW. One reason
          for this is the substitution of flexible packaging for rigid, meaning fewer
          cans and bottles and less weight for recycling. Many flexible packages
          cannot be easily recycled because of too little mass to be economical, dif-
          ficulties in materials handling, and composite materials that cannot be
          separated. Many flexible films are multi-layers of various polymers so as
          to preserve the contents. Many rigid packages are being made with less
          material to reduce cost. These trends will reduce the amount of materials
          sent to disposal and recycling. The draft report makes no mention of these
          trends.
Response:
Comment noted for the record.


ALTER-5: The draft report, page 2-10, plots trends but makes no mention of the as-
          sumptions that were used in constructing the plots. Reference is given to
          the NEMWDA planning model but a reader of the MSP report should not
          have to research and check that model.

ALTER-6: Materials Separation Plan: Section 3 of the draft plan makes appropriate
          mention, but could stress more, the success of the two Counties in improv-
          ing recycling over the past few years. Frederick County has a balanced
          program (outreach through engineering and sales) that could be the envy
          of any jurisdiction in the nation. Unfortunately, comparisons in recycling
          success cannot be made except within the state because there are no stan-
          dard methods for calculating recycling rates. Nor are there standard me-
          thods for determining if a jurisdiction can meet the highest and best value
          markets.
Response:
Comment noted for the record. The Final Draft MSP will be revised to emphasize this
point.


ALTER-7: The draft MSP plan should be amended to include the recent grant award
          to Frederick County from Keep America Beautiful to expand recycling
          through better marketing. The award was given because of the County's
          advanced data collection systems and aggressive approach toward improv-
          ing recycling.
Response:
Comment noted for the record. A discussion of the grant award from Curbside Value
Partnership (Keep America Beautiful) will be included in the Final Draft MSP.


ALTER-8: The MSP should include more mention of business recycling. This 45-55
          weight percent of the MSW is a treasure trove of recyclable material. Par-
          ticipation (by numbers and weight) are far below households. A different
          logistical system is needed to collect the materials, which should fit well
          into the single stream system used for households. The MSP report should
          make mention of the efforts beginning in the city of Frederick (and envi-
          rons), which has the most to contribute.
Response:
Section 3.2.2.1 and 3.3.4.1 describe the business recycling programs in Frederick and
Carroll Counties. Additional information will be updated in the Final Draft MSP.


ALTER-9: Summary: In my opinion, the summary section of the draft plan could be
          immensely improved by greater stress on the future (become more of a
          plan and less of a report of status quo.). After the WTE plant is con-
          structed and operating, the recycling programs in-place will continue,
          metals from the ash will be added (pointing out that not all metal pieces in
          the waste are separated, as other communities have learned), and the ash

                                           28               Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
             will be beneficially used. The current 44 percent or so recycling and waste
             diversion will increase sharply with the WTE plant. Thus, a recycling plan
             for the Counties must include the WTE plant as an integral part of that
             plan.
Response:
As stated in Sections 3.2.2.8 and 3.3.4.8 of the Preliminary Draft MSP, when FCCRWTE
becomes operational, following combustion, ferrous and nonferrous metals will be sepa-
rated from the bottom ash. Metals recovered at FCCRWTE will be recycled through vari-
ous contracts. A percentage of ash recovered from FCCRWTE will be taken to the ap-
propriate disposal site(s) where it could be used as daily cover in place of soil materials
from other sources. NEA, in cooperation with Frederick and Carroll Counties, will also
investigate other ash recycling options.


The summary section of the Final Draft MSP will be amended to respond to this com-
ment.


ALTER-10: There will be additional; beneficial use which, although not required
           mention in 40 CFR 605, is additional resource recovery. Today there
           are certain products, such as sanitary papers, that are not recyclable as
           materials. These products become fuel rather than landfill and precur-
           sors of leachate.
Response:
NEA concurs with these comments.


ALTER-11: Current recycling operations receive old tires. The MSP might point out
           where these go; market and usage is small or expensive and energy in-
           tensive (shredding). Tires' highest and best use may be as a fuel. The
           same is true for mattresses. Diverting these materials to the WTE plant
           is an alternative to landfill. They cannot be recycled as materials nor
           composted.
Response:
Comments noted for the record.


ALTER-12: The MSP should point out that the Counties have examined alternative
           technologies, which were found wanting. It is essential for the public
           sector not to make risky investments in new approaches with big claims


                                            29                Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
              and no experience. The public must know that there are no silver bul-
              lets. Furthermore, the gee-whiz MSW technologies of today are no dif-
              ferent than the gee-whiz technologies of 40 or more years ago. There,
              the literature is clear.

Please refer to the response to TWIGG-3. Comment noted for the record.


ALTER-13: Comments from the Public Hearing: Only a few of the comments at the
           public hearing were on point of the draft MSP and some of these were
           factually wrong. Some of these comments ignored several truisms of sol-
           id waste management.

              1. We cannot recycle what is not in the waste.
              2. We cannot take something that nobody wants and make it into some-
                 thing else that nobody wants and call it recycling. (Large scale com-
                 posting is a case in point.)
              3. There is no gold in garbage. Recycling costs money. Citizens should
                 know this, and how much, before they are offered more programs.
                 The MSP should point out that it does not address economics but
                 that there are costs.
Response:
NEA concurs with these comments.


ALTER-14: One or more of the people commenting argued that recycling and the
          WTE plant will compete for combustible resources. The MSP should
          point out that this is not necessarily true as long as the materials recy-
          cling programs are maintained.
Response:
The Final Draft MSP will be revised. Please refer to the response to SORBELLO-1.


ALTER-15: In Conclusion: It is my judgment that the draft MSP is realistic and
           achievable. It fulfills the requirements of 40 CFR 605 [60]. It can be im-
           proved through the addition of a bit more material, as described herein.

DOW-1: I am concerned with the proposed plan in a few areas.

         1) I don't believe that tires should be accepted to be burned in the incinera-
            tor. The toxins released when burnt are of concern to me.

DOW-2: 2)      2.1 states that Additional Waste from outside of primary area will be ac-
               cepted. I don't believe that waste from outside the two counties should be
               accepted. Perhaps if there is not enough to burn at capacity, a smaller
               size should be built.

DOW-3: 3)      2.2.1.4 "may be used to transfer incoming MSW to facility for
               processing. I am under the impression that waste will be transferred to
               the Reichs Ford Transfer Station on Reichs Ford Road, sorted and then
               shipped to the Incinerator. I am concerned about this for this would in-
               crease the amount of traffic on the Reichs Ford Corridor.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. There will be a reduced volume of truck traffic flow on Reichs Ford
Road, since a portion of the solid waste route delivery trucks will travel directly to
FCCRWTE for unloading rather than stopping at the Reichs Ford Transfer Station. Please

RAK Letter-1: General Comments
              1.) Publishing the Material Separation Plan in a format that does not
              allow printing may be legal but seems nefarious. Do not limit public
              access in situations where public input is being requested.
Response:
Please refer to the response to CUBIT-1.


RAK Letter-2: 2.) A material separation plan "identifies both a goal and an
                approach to separate certain components of municipal
                solid waste for a given service area in order to make
                the separated materials available for recycling."
                (from the Code of Federal Regulations)

                Many, if not most, of the combustible materials in a municipal waste
                stream are already recyclable or compostable. So, incineration inhe-
                rently competes with the Federal goal of separating materials for recy-
                cling.

                The competition between incineration and recycling will intensify over
                the projected life of the facility. New markets for recyclable materials
                have developed over the past few decades and this trend will continue
                as energy costs rise. However, taxpayers are contractually obligated to
                feed the facility. The material separation plan should require that no
                recyclable or compostable materials will be incinerated to comply with
                Code of Federal Regulations.
Response:
Please refer to the response to TOME-4. The MSP complies with the applicable federal
air regulations by complementing the efforts of the Counties to divert recyclable and
compostable materials from the solid waste stream prior to disposal.

                 The Code of Federal Regulations requires that Material Separation
                 Plans identify approaches for separating components of their waste
                 stream. The plan for this facility only describes this for Frederick and
                 Carroll counties. In order to run efficiently the 1,500 ton per day fa-
                 cility requires importing waste from areas outside of Frederick and
                 Carroll counties. The material separation plan must describe how ma-
                 terials will be made available for recycling in the entire area serviced
                 by the incinerator, not just Frederick and Carroll counties.

                 Define all areas that will be serviced by the incinerator and define how
                 materials will be separated for the entire service area.
Response:
Contracts for nonprimary service areas have not been finalized. Energy Recovery
Agreements similar to Frederick and Carroll Counties' agreements would be required for
all other counties delivering waste to FCCRWTE. Please refer to the response to
TOME-4.


RAK Letter-4: 4.) Section 1.2
               The only materials designated for separation before burning are "large
               bulky metal items". All recyclable and compostable materials should
               be recovered before burning.
Response:
Please refer to the response to DYSON-2. As explained in the response to DYSON-2, the
MSP identifies the Frederick and Carroll County material separation programs, which
will successfully remove a relatively high percentage of recyclables and compostable ma-
terials from the solid waste stream prior to disposal.


RAK Letter-5: The plan does not include a centralized mechanical separation system
               or a plastics/rubber recycling unit as outlined in the Code of Federal
               Regulations.
Response:
The Code of Federal Regulations does not require these systems for FCCRWTE. The de-
finition of materials separation plan (40 CFR 60.51b, Definitions) includes: "A materials
separation plan may include elements such as dropoff facilities...or centralized mechani-
cal separation systems..." (emphasis added).

The plastics/rubber recycling unit definition is applicable to Subpart AAAA, Small Mu-
nicipal Combustion Units. FCCRWTE is subject to Subpart Eb, Large Municipal Com-
bustion Units.


RAK Letter-6: 5.) Section 2.1
               Change the first sentence from:
                 "The service areas for the MSP described in this doc-
                 ument include all residential, business, industrial,
                 institutional, and commercial waste generators of
                 Frederick and Carroll Counties, Maryland."
                 To:
                 "The primary service area for the MSP described in
                 this document includes all residential, business, in-
                 dustrial, institutional, and commercial waste genera-
                 tors of Frederick and Carroll Counties, Maryland but
                 the facility will serve other areas that are not yet
                 defined."
Response:
The Final Draft MSP will be modified.


RAKLetter-7: 6.) Change the final sentence from: "Additional waste from
                 outside of the primary service area will be accepted
                 to enable the FCCRWTE facility to operate at its de-
                 signed capacity."
                 To:
                 "Additional waste from outside of the primary service
                 area must be accepted to enable the FCCRWTE facility
                 to operate at its designed capacity."
Response:
The Final Draft MSP will be modified as recommended


RAKLetter-8: 7.) Section 2.4
              Figure 2-1 projects Frederick and Carroll counties will generate about
              333 tons of waste annually in 2015 and 364 tons annually in 2025. But
              a 1,500 ton per day facility handles 547 tons per year. This means the
              facility is oversized by two thirds at the outset and half even for the fur-
              thest projection shown. Why is the facility so over-built?
Response:
Please refer to the response to TWIGG-1 . In 2006 and 2007, a team of Frederick and
Carroll County solid waste staff, NEA staff, and an independent engineering consultant


                                           35                Y:\GDP-11\WHEEL\MSP-COMRESP.DOCX--020711
reviewed a number of proposals for a regional waste-to-energy project. The 1,500-ton-
per-day regional waste=to=energy facility provided the lowest per ton cost for the dis-
posal of Frederick and Carroll County's solid waste.


RAK Letter-9: 2025 is about when our planet reaches peak oil production. Will other
               counties and states still be willing to ship waste to Frederick with in-
               creased fuel costs or will they find local recycling and composting less
               expensive?
Response:
Comment noted for the record.


RAK Letter-10: 8.) Section 3.1
                List combustibles in the waste stream that will fuel the incinerator
                after source reduction and recyclable and compostable materials are
                removed from the waste stream. Will these be available over the life
                of the incinerator? If not, describe how the incinerator will be fed
                while still complying with Federal and Maryland material separation
                objectives.
Response:
Typical municipal solid waste composition varies widely. Table 2 of the "Solid Waste
Modeling Support for Frederick County, Maryland Board of Commissioners" by RTI In-
ternational (2008) lists the postrecovery waste composition. A recent study (Waste Com-
position Sampling & Analysis Study, Montgomery County, MD, Final Report; SCS En-
gineers; 2009) showed that the top three waste material components (organic, paper, and
plastic) are relatively consistent.


It is impossible to predict the composition of municipal solid waste over the life of
FCCRWTE. Comment is noted for the record.


RAK Letter-11: 9.) Section 3.2.2.8
                Recyclable materials should be recovered from the waste stream prior
                to burning. Hazardous materials should be removed from the waste
                stream prior to burning.

Response:
Please refer to the response to TOME-4 and RAK Letter-4. Facility permits will prohibit
acceptance of hazardous waste.


RAK Letter-12: 10.) Section 4.1
                The paragraph only describes items from a 2005 report. The material
                separation plan should include the additional solid waste disposal op-
                tions presented in 2009 and 2010 since the newer alternatives better
                fulfill Federal and Maryland material separation goals.
Response:
This comment raises an issue outside of the scope of the MSP requirement in the federal
air regulations. The MSP need not justify the decision to build the facility. The 2005 re-
port (assume reference to the RW Beck report; http://www.frederickcountymd.gov
/index.aspx?NID=3208, last accessed February 2, 2011) is the comprehensive technology
review document used for Frederick County to direct NEA to undertake the procurement
that led to a contract for the design, permitting, construction, operation, and maintenance
of FCCRWTE. There were reports and presentations made to the Frederick County Board
of County Commissioners on various emerging technologies or processes that were re-
viewed by Frederick County staff. After review of the various proposals, the Frederick
County Board of County Commissioners did not take action to redirect the efforts of
NEA as it pertains to FCCRWTE.

                                                                     SUMMARY
        This report has been updated based on comments provided by Frederick County and SHA on the
Draft Traffic Impact Study dated August 30, 2010, and to reflect additional studies and analysis completed
between August and October, 2010. The comments and responses are provided in a memorandum dated
November 22, 2010, included as Appendix A.

       The Frederick Carroll Waste to Energy (FCWTE) facility site is located at the north end of
Metropolitan Court near the intersection of English Muffin Way and Maryland State Highway 85 (MD 85)
(Buckeystown Pike) in the McKinney Industrial Park in Frederick, Maryland. The facility will be owned by
the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority and operated by Wheelabrator Technologies, Inc.
Operation of the facility is expected in Spring 2015.

         The facility will process municipal solid waste to generate electricity and will operate 24 hours per
day, 7 days per week. Site traffic is comprised of daytime employees, a few shift employees to maintain
the 24-hour operation, delivery of municipal solid waste, and hauling of ash from the site to the landfill.
The ash may be back-hauled by waste delivery trucks, but to be conservative, this Traffic Impact Analysis
assumes that no ash back-hauling will occur. The total weekday peak hour traffic generated by the
FCWTE site is 49 trips in and 23 trips out in the morning (7-8 AM) peak and 5 trips in and 26 trips out in
the afternoon (5-6 PM) peak.

         The purpose of this Traffic Impact Analysis is to evaluate and suggest mitigation for the traffic
impacts that the FCWTE facility will have on the adjacent roadway network, focusing on the site access
intersection of MD 85 (Buckeystown Pike) and English Muffin Way, and five other key intersection in the
corridor from MD 80 to the south, to the intersections with the I-270 interchange ramps to the north.

         For Existing 2010 conditions, all study area intersections currently operate at Level of Service
(LOS) D or better during both the AM and PM peaks on a weekday based on Critical Lane Volume (CLV).
Based on Highway Capacity Manual (Synchro analyses) methods, all study area intersections operate at
LOS D or better during the AM peak while MD 85 @ Crestwood Blvd. and MD 85 @ I-270 Northbound
Ramps operate at LOS E during the PM peak. The site access intersection currently operates at LOS A
(B) in the AM (PM) peaks.

          Eleven (11) project site developments have been approved by Frederick County which contribute
traffic to the MD 85 corridor. The background traffic from these sites (prorated for the expected 2015
Build-Out levels, per the County's Guidelines) generate a total of 1,940 (2,308) trips in the AM (PM)
peaks, respectively. Summary Table i on the next page provides the operations analyses for the Existing,
Combined Background and Total traffic, using the Critical Lane Analysis method as suggested in the
Guidelines.

          MD 85 @ I-270 Northbound Ramps: Mitigation includes contribution to the existing Escrow
          account (#3259 (21581)) in place to provide an additional northbound left turn lane at this
          intersection. This improvement will be designed to be consistent with the future interchange
          project for MD 85/I-270 by the SHA.

          MD 85 @ I-270 Southbound Ramps: There is an existing Escrow account at this intersection
          (#3258 (21580)) to provide two southbound left turn lanes at this intersection, which would
          provide limited improvement in CLV from 1,625 to 1,552, and a reduction in delay for the critical
          northbound movement of only about 1 second.

          Frederick County DPDR and the State Highway Administration have reviewed this Escrow
          improvement and determined that more benefit is gained by providing a reversible lane system
          for this intersection, of three lanes in the peak direction/one lane in the off-peak direction. This
          improvement would provide some temporary relief until the MD 85/I-270 interchange
          improvements are implemented.

          The County has advised that contribution to the current Escrow account, with the reversible lane
          system as the intended improvement, is preferred.

        In addition to the above mitigation measures, improvements at MD 85 / English Muffin Way are
recommended to accommodate the site traffic. This includes widening the roadway in the northeast
quadrant to provide a larger turning radius for trucks from westbound English Muffin Way to northbound
MD 85. The current turning radius is inadequate for larger trucks, and to make this turn, trucks currently
swing wide into the path of southbound left turning vehicles. With this improvement, trucks could turn right
onto northbound MD 85 without impeding the flow of southbound traffic.

         In compliance with the County's Guidelines for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Analyses for
Development Applications (July 2009), an additional analysis scenario was completed as follows: "If no
constructed improvements would be required to satisfy APFO requirements under (the prorated
background) traffic scenario, a second scenario assuming the accounting of trips from all pipeline and
pending development, regardless of when it would be developed, must be analyzed.". For this scenario,
the site only needs to mitigate its own CLV contribution to any failing intersections.


                                                                            December 2010                                                    Page ii of vi
                                                                                    Frederick Carroll Waste to Energy Facility 
                                                                                                         Traffic Impact Study       
 
         This scenario applies at MD 85/English Muffin Way in the PM peak and MD 85/Executive Way in
the AM Peak, since the site CLV contribution is greater than 15 for these intersections/peaks, but
mitigation was not required under the first scenario. Based on the results of this second traffic scenario,
Executive Way still operates at Level of Service D or better, but additional mitigation measures are
needed for the intersection of MD 85 / English Muffin Way to mitigate for the site CLVs (19 total). The
following modifications are proposed to provide this mitigation:

        MD 85 @ English Muffin Way: Modify the eastbound lane use to provide one left turn lane, a
        shared left/through lane, and a right turn lane. In addition split phasing is required for the east and
        west approaches with this change.

         This improvement provides mitigation for the heavy traffic volume growth anticipated on the west
approach of English Muffin Way, due to the approved developments of: Russell Property, University Auto
­ Bowman's Plains Lot 2, Wedgewood Wellington Lots 1 & 2, Younkin Farm, Wedgewood Lot 16B and
Wellington Lot 3. With this mitigation measure, the MD 85 / English Muffin Way intersection will operate at
level of service D in the PM peak with a CLV of 1,366. This is a gain of 345 CLVs at the intersection,
which more than mitigates for the site contribution of 19 CLVs.

        The site's Pro-Rata Share for the above mitigation options is detailed in Section VIII of the report.
The total proposed contribution is $ 252,717.

I.       Introduction
        The Frederick Carroll Waste to Energy (FCWTE) facility site is located at the north end of
Metropolitan Court near the intersection of English Muffin Way and Maryland State Highway 85
(Buckeystown Pike) within the McKinney Industrial Park in Frederick, Maryland. The facility will be owned
by the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority (NEA) and operated by Wheelabrator Technologies,
Inc. Operation of the facility is expected in Spring 2015.

         The site is predominately an open field that currently has construction activity associated with the
expansion of the adjacent County wastewater treatment plant. It is bounded by railroad tracks on the
west side, the County's Ballenger Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant on the north side, the Monocacy
River on the east side, and the County's DUSWM Administrative building on the south side.

          The facility will have a capacity of 1,500 tons per day (TPD) and will process municipal solid
waste to generate clean, renewable electricity for sale to the local utility. The location of the site is shown
in Figure 1 and a Site Development Plan (SKC-204) is provided following Figure 1. The future Monocacy
trail is not shown on the site plan; however, NEA understands that the construction of FCWTE facility
should not inhibit the construction of the trail by others.

         The types of traffic that will enter and exit the FCWTE site will be composed of employees (plant
operators and plant staff), maintenance personnel, general delivery vehicles, municipal solid waste
delivery trucks, and ash hauling trucks.

          The purpose of this Traffic Impact Study is to evaluate the potential traffic impacts of the FCWTE
facility on the adjacent roadway network, focusing on the site access intersection of MD 85 (Buckeystown
Pike) and English Muffin Way, and the MD 85 corridor.

II.      2010 Existing Traffic Conditions

      Study Intersections

        The access to the site is via an entrance on English Muffin Way located approximately 1,200 feet
east of MD 85. English Muffin Way is a County roadway; no direct access to the site will be provided from
MD 85. As stipulated by Frederick County Division of Permitting and Development Review, traffic
operations at the following six (6) intersections were included for this study:

         MD 85 at MD 80
         MD 85 at English Muffin Way
         MD 85 at Executive Way
         MD 85 at Crestwood Boulevard/Shockley Drive
         MD 85 at Ramps 6/7 to I-270 Southbound
         MD 85 at Ramps 2/3 to I-270 Northbound

        These intersections are identified in Figure 1. All intersections are signalized except for the MD
85 at MD 80 intersection which is stop controlled along MD 80. Lane use along the approaches at each of
the study intersections and the existing storage bay lengths for left turn and right turn movements are
provided in Figure 2.

      Traffic Volumes

         The FCWTE facility will be in operation 24 hrs a day/7 days per week. However, only a handful of
staff, working in 12-hour shifts, is required to maintain this operation. Because solid waste is primarily
received at the site on weekdays and Saturdays, existing traffic volumes were obtained for the roadway
peak by conducting counts on a weekday from 6AM to 7PM. Historic intersection, ramp and tube counts
are available along MD 85 within the study limits, ranging from Year 2003 to Year 2009 from the State

Highway Administration's Highway Information Services Division (HISD). To supplement this data and
accurately assess traffic conditions in Year 2010, the following data collection was performed by RK&K in
June 2010 before the Frederick County schools closed for the summer:

        13-hour turning movement counts were conducted on Tuesday, June 8, 2010 from 6:00 AM to
        7:00 PM at the below intersections:
            o MD 85 @ MD 80
            o MD 85 @ English Muffin Way
            o MD 85 @ Crestwood Boulevard/Shockley Drive
        13-hour turning movement count was conducted on Thursday, June 10, 2010 from 6:00 AM to
        7:00 PM at the below intersection:
            o MD 85 @ Executive Way
        48-hour machine counts were conducted from Tuesday, June 8, 2010 thru Thursday, June 10,
        2010 for the following I-270 interchange ramps:
            o Ramp 1 (From I-270 Northbound to MD 85 Southbound)
            o Ramp 2 to I-270 Northbound
            o Ramp 6 to I-270 Southbound
            o Ramp 8 (From I-270 Southbound to MD 85 Southbound)

          The source of volumes for Ramp 5 (From I-270 Southbound to MD 85 Northbound) is the MD 85
Corridor Study developed by SHA Travel Forecasting Division in November 2008. The Ramp 4 volumes
(From I-270 Northbound to MD 85 Northbound) were obtained by computing the difference between the
thru volumes at MD 85/Ramp 5 and MD 85/Ramp 2 intersections. These volumes are in line with the
November 2003 48-hour count available as part of the HISD database as well as the 2010 volumes
developed as part of the I-270 Multimodal Corridor Study by the Travel Forecasting Division. The peak
hour turning movement volumes are summarized in Figure 3. The complete turning movement count data
is provided in Appendix B. Photographs of all study area intersections are provided in Appendix C.

         The lane configurations and volumes shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 include traffic from the I-270
ramps. However, the additional lane along MD 85 and ramp volumes from I-270 were not included in the
CLV calculations at both MD 85/I-270 southbound ramps and MD 85/I-270 northbound ramps
intersections. This is because Ramp 4 at the northbound ramps intersection and Ramp 8 at the
southbound ramps intersection are free-flow movements that are not controlled by the signal so do not
impact the intersection operations. In addition, southbound MD 85 at the southbound ramps intersection
and northbound MD 85 at the northbound ramps intersection are also free-flow movements and not
controlled by the signal.

    Observations

         Based on peak hour field visits on June 10, 2010, the following key observations were noted at
the intersection of MD 85 at English Muffin Way:

        The turn radius in the northeast corner for westbound right turning vehicles from English Muffin
        Way appears inadequate for large trucks.

        The southbound left turns from MD 85 to eastbound English Muffin Way require some adjustment
        (especially large trucks) in their turning path in the instances where there is a vehicle parked
        within 100 feet of the intersection along the south side of English Muffin Way.

        There are existing railroad tracks across English Muffin Way approximately 600 feet east of MD
        85. Based on field observations, there were about 15 train crossings between the hours of 6 AM
        and 7 PM on a typical weekday. The approximate crossing times ranged from 2 to 4 minutes.
        Most of the trains were MARC trains with few freight trains.

        Extended queuing was observed during the PM peak along eastbound Crestwood Boulevard at
        MD 85.

        Queue spill back was observed for the entire duration of the PM peak hour for the northbound
        MD 85 left turns onto I-270 northbound via Ramp 3.

    Crash History

        Crash data and rates for the MD 85 study segment and the six key study area intersections was
obtained from SHA for the 4-year period from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2009.The crash rates
along the MD 85 study segment were compared to the statewide average for similar segments. As shown
in the chart below, the crash rate within the study segment for fatalities, injuries and property damage
crashes is lower than the statewide average for similar facilities.

         Also, SHA's Crash Safety Analysis Team confirmed that neither the MD 85 study segment nor
any of the study area intersections were listed as a priority or secondary Candidate Safety Improvement
Locations for the years 2006-2008 (2009 listing will be available in the first quarter of 2011).

         The intersection crash history was summarized by severity, type and cause to identify any trends.
A total of 51 crashes occurred at all six intersections combined over 4 years (2006-2009). None of these
intersection crashes resulted in a fatality. The most prevalent types of crashes involved left turns (43%)
and rear-ends (25%). The majority of the left-turn crashes involved the southbound left turns at the I-270
Southbound Ramps intersection while the majority of the rear-end crashes occurred along northbound
and southbound MD 85 at the Crestwood Boulevard intersection.

        Grouping the crash trends by cause, there were 2 crashes involving trucks, which represents
about 4% of all crashes at the six key study area intersections. One truck-related crash occurred at
Crestwood Boulevard and one at the I-270 Southbound ramp intersection. The crashes by cause are
shown in the chart below. Please note that the total number of crashes by cause shown in the chart below
does not equal 51 crashes that occurred at all intersections combined for the duration of the study period.
This is because one crash can involve multiple causes; for example, a nighttime crash could have
happened on wet surface.

         Based on the above, it can be concluded that none of the study area intersections experience any
significant safety issues. The crashes by severity and by type are also summarized and shown in
Appendix D along with the detailed crash data.

      Capacity Analyses of Existing Conditions

       Capacity analyses were performed for the 2010 existing traffic using the weekday AM and PM
peak hour traffic volumes shown in Figure 3. The analyses were performed using both the Critical Lane
Volume (CLV) method and Highway Capacity Manual method (Synchro (version 7)).

         The CLV method is a planning-level analysis tool used to compute level of service for signalized
intersections. This analysis is based on lane configurations and hourly traffic volumes at the intersection.
It does not account for pedestrian flows, vehicle mix, signal timing, and other variables. LOS A (critical
lane volume less than or equal to 1,000 vehicles) represents the best possible operating conditions with
virtually no delay per vehicle, whereas LOS F (critical lane volume greater than 1,600 vehicles)
represents congested conditions with relatively high average delay per vehicle. CLV analyses were
performed for all six study intersections mentioned earlier in this report. Although CLV is a widely
accepted methodology for capacity analysis among Maryland's transportation agencies, especially for
planning level analyses, both CLV and HCM/Synchro were completed for this study to fully account for
the trucks associated with the site traffic.

        Synchro version 7.0 was developed by Trafficware, Ltd. using the capacity analysis theories and
methodologies that are provided in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual developed by the Transportation
Research Board. Both signalized and unsignalized intersection capacity is measured in terms of levels of
service (LOS) and delay. LOS A (delay  10 seconds per vehicle (sec/veh)) represents the best possible
operating conditions for both signalized and unsignalized intersections. Whereas LOS F (delay > 80
sec/veh for signalized intersections and delay > 50 sec/veh for unsignalized intersections) represents
congested conditions where the traffic volume has reached or exceeded available capacity, resulting in
excessive delays. Synchro analyses were performed for all six study intersections except MD 80 since

MD 85 at MD 80 is unsignalized and this study assumes that the intersection will not be signalized within
the analysis time frame.

        The key input variables used for Synchro analysis are as follows:

                       Lane widths along MD 85 and all side streets are 12 ft.
                       Transfer trailers are WB-67 vehicles. (Wheelbase (WB) is the distance, in feet,
                       measured between the front wheel axle of a vehicle and its rear most wheel axle. For
                       example, a WB-67 truck has 67 feet between the front and the rear most wheel axle.)
                       Route trucks are 30 feet in length.
                       Prevailing speed along MD 85 is 45 miles per hour (MPH) and along all side streets is 30
                       MPH except for the west leg of Crestwood Blvd. which is 35 MPH.
                       Heavy vehicle percentage values are:

                           o Crestwood Boulevard, Shockley Drive and I-270 ramps: 8%
                      (Truck percentages along MD 85 and I-270 ramps are based on historic class counts
                      while the side street values are based on existing/projected land use)
                      {*The truck percentages along MD 85 in the southern sections could have been lowered
                      to 7% and English Muffin Way to 15% based on RK&K's 24-hr count at MD 85/English
                      Muffin Way conducted on October 20, 2010. However, in order to be conservative, higher
                      percentages were retained for Synchro analyses}
                       The signal timing used for all signalized intersections for existing conditions was
                       provided by SHA and verified with field observations.

analysis, MD 85 @ Crestwood Blvd and MD 85 @ I-270 Northbound Ramps operate at LOS E during the
PM peak hour.

       The difference between CLV and Synchro LOS especially for the intersections with I-270 ramps is
because CLV LOS is based solely on the "critical" movement's capacity while the Synchro LOS is based
on average delay experienced by all approaches.

        The worksheets for all the 2010 Existing Capacity Analyses (Critical Lane Method and Synchro)
are provided in Appendix E. The Synchro output also includes timing diagrams for all signalized
intersections.

III.      2015 Background Traffic Conditions

       Regional Growth

          The background traffic developed for these analyses is a combination of regional growth and the
traffic generated by the approved but un-built developments in the vicinity of the FCWTE site, as provided
by the Frederick County Division of Permitting and Development Review (DPDR). As recommended by
the County, a 1% compounded annual growth rate was applied as the regional growth rate. The County
recommended this rate because actual growth has been flat in recent years, and nearly all of the
background traffic along MD 85 is from the developments in the pipeline, which are included individually.
The County does not believe that there is much additional growth, if any, anticipated for the area, other
than what is included in the Background Development traffic volumes.

         The minutes from a May 21, 2010 meeting that was held with staff from the Frederick County
DPDR and Comprehensive Planning is included as Appendix F. The minutes include the discussion
about the growth rate that was agreed upon and the basis for the background developments that were
identified to be included in the study. Since operation of the FCWTE facility is anticipated by 2015, the
existing through traffic volumes shown in Figure 3 were increased by 1% per year compounded for five
(5) years. The 2015 Base Peak Hour Volumes are shown in Figure 4.

    X. Wedgewood Lot 16B (11,800 SF Warehousing) located on the west side of MD 85 along
        Wedgewood Boulevard, north of English Muffin Way.

        English Muffin Way and New Design Road.

      Prorated Background Traffic Volumes

          The trips generated by each of the above developments were provided by the County and are
summarized in Table 2. Per Frederick County's Guidelines for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Analyses
for Development Applications, July 2009 (TIA Guidelines) and as recommended by the County Division of
Permitting and Development Review, the background traffic volumes were prorated to include only the
amount to be constructed by year 2015. It is assumed that all background developments listed above
except for developments II and IX will be phased over at least 10 years. At the assumed rate of 10% per
year beginning in year 2010, only 50% of the background development traffic will be in place by 2015 for
all listed developments except for II and X which are assumed to be complete by year 2015.

         For all developments, the trip distribution was assumed as 70 - 90% to/from the north and 10 -
30% to/from the south for both entering and exiting traffic. The combined background development (base
plus all background developments) traffic volumes under prorated scenario for a typical weekday are
shown in Figure 5.

    Prorated Background Capacity Analyses

          The 2015 background traffic condition for the weekday AM and PM peak hours was developed by
adding the volumes shown in Figures 4 (background growth) and 5 (approved/prorated development
traffic) and summarized in Figure 6 (combined background traffic). The capacity analyses of the 2015
combined background traffic conditions were performed using the weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic
volumes in Figure 6 with both CLV and Synchro. The results for 2015 combined background conditions
are summarized in Table 3. For Synchro analysis, the signal timings were the same as existing.

                                                                   Table 3

       Based on CLV analyses, during the AM peak hour, all of the six study intersections operate at
LOS D or better. During the PM peak hour, three of the six study area intersections operate at an
acceptable LOS D or better while the other three operate at LOS F.

        Based on Synchro analyses, during the AM peak hour, four of the five signalized intersections
operate at LOS D or better while MD 85 @ Crestwood Blvd. operates at LOS E. During the PM peak
hour, four of the five signalized intersections operate at LOS E or F while MD 85 @ I-270 southbound
ramps operates at LOS D.

        The worksheets for all the background capacity analyses (Critical Lane Method and Synchro) are
provided in Appendix H.

    Planned Improvements

        As noted in Table 3 above, MD 85 @ Crestwood Blvd., MD 85 @ I-270 Southbound Ramps and
MD 85 @ I-270 Northbound Ramps operate at a failing LOS either in the AM or PM or both peaks under
2015 combined background conditions. However, the SHA has an active project planning study to
upgrade MD 85 to a multi-lane divided highway from south of English Muffin Way to north of Grove Road.
The MD 85 Phase I interchange project is the first of three projects included in the "MD 85 Planning
Study". The project includes a new interchange at MD 85 and I-270, along with roadway improvements to
MD 85 between Spectrum Drive and Crestwood Boulevard. Phase 2 of the Planning Study extends
southward from Crestwood Boulevard to English Muffin Way, and includes the replacement of the bridge
over Ballenger Creek. Phase 3 extends from Spectrum Drive northward to tie-in with the recently-
completed improvements near the MD 85/MD 355 intersection. The MD 85 Project Planning Study details
are provided in Appendix I.

        Phase I of the project includes upgrading the MD 85 interchange at I-270 and the tie-ins required
at Spectrum Drive and Crestwood Boulevard. The interchange design will need to be compatible with
long-term improvements proposed as part of the I-270/US 15 Multimodal Study. The two I-270 bridges
over MD 85 will be removed and replaced with a longer, wider structure that can accommodate the
additional lanes required on MD 85 for the design year traffic (2030). Northbound MD 85 will expand from
the existing two lane section under the bridge to five lanes: A double-left that exits to I-270 North, two
through lanes, and an acceleration/deceleration lane for the loop ramps. Southbound MD 85 will expand
to four lanes: A double-left that exits to I-270 South and two through lanes. Additional space will be
included for future expansion of MD 85.

        This additional capacity will significantly improve the LOS at the three failing intersections cited
above. Phase I of the MD 85 study is currently funded for design only. Because no funding is currently
available for construction, these improvements were not included in the analyses of the 2015 combined
background conditions.

IV.      Site Generated Traffic
         The types of traffic that will enter and exit the FCWTE site are as follows:

                        Employees (plant operators and plant staff)
                        Maintenance personnel
                        General delivery vehicles
                        Municipal Solid Waste delivery trucks (including transfer trailers)
                        Ash Hauling trucks

        Refuse delivery vehicles will enter the facility site from Metropolitan Court through a security gate
and travel along the facility access road to the weighing scale. After the trucks are weighed on the scales,
the vehicles will be directed to the facility's enclosed receiving hall. After unloading, the empty trucks will
be weighed again, if needed, on the truck scale before exiting the facility.

          A 75 space parking lot is located on-site for employees, maintenance workers, deliveries, and
visitors/tours.

      Weekday Site Trips

         The trip generation for the site on a typical weekday includes the following:

         There will be a total of 51 employees on-site per day
              o Plant operators will work from either 6 AM to 6 PM or 7 AM to 7 PM in five rotating shifts
                  of five employees each for a total of 25 operators per day.
              o Plant staff of 26 will work a daytime schedule from 8 AM ­ 5 PM Monday thru Friday.
         There will be an average of 4 delivery trucks per week which will be weekday off-peak arrivals.
         Daily Truck Traffic carrying municipal solid waste (MSW) will be composed of arrivals from
         Frederick County, Carroll County and other municipalities (Howard and Washington Counties).
         The trucks are composed of self-unloading route trucks and transfer trailers bringing in MSW as
         well as transfer trailer ash trucks hauling ash back to their respective counties. However, it should
         be noted that not all incoming MSW transfer trailers will backhaul ash. To be conservative in the
         trip generation estimate, this report assumes that ash will not be backhauled by MSW trucks, but
         will be hauled in separate ash trucks.
         The truck trip generation is based on MSW throughput of 1,650 tons per day (even though the
         plant capacity is 1,500 tons per day), to be conservative in the site trip generation.

        The trip generation for the site was provided by the NEA, the owner of this site, and was
developed specifically for this facility for the functions that will be operating there. The NEA owns several

The trip distribution for the site is as follows and is shown in Figure 7:

Trucks:
 47% to/from MD 85 north of I-270
 33% to/from the north/west on I-270
 9% to/from the south/east on I-270
 6% to/from MD 80
 5% to/from MD 85 south of MD 80
The truck trip distributions were provided by the NEA and were developed from a review of the waste
collection coverage area for the proposed site and the haul routes from other collection sites.

Employees:
 30% to/from MD 85 north of I-270
 40% to/from the north/west on I-270
 15% to/from the south/east on I-270
 2% to/from Crestwood Boulevard to the west of MD 85
 1% to/from Executive Way to the west of MD 85
 2% to/from English Muffin Way to the west of MD 85
 5% to/from MD 80
 5% to/from MD 85 south of MD 80
The employee trip distributions were provided by the County DPDR and are based on existing travel
patterns, with some adjustments to these patterns to account for approved development in the area.

NEA's routing assumptions for municipal solid waste trucks and diurnal distributions on which the site trip
generation and distribution is based on are provided in Appendix J. The total weekday site generated
peak hour volumes are shown in Figure 7. The inbound and outbound site volumes for the period 5AM ­
6PM on weekdays are shown in the charts above.

V.                                            2015 Total Build-Out Traffic Conditions
         The 2015 total build-out traffic for the weekday AM and PM peak hours was developed by adding
the volumes in Figures 6 and 7 and is summarized in Figure 8. The capacity analyses of the total build-
out traffic conditions were performed for the weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes shown in
Figure 8 using the Critical Lane Volume method and Synchro. The results are summarized in Table 5.
Existing signal timings were used for the Synchro analyses.

        Based on Synchro analyses, during the AM peak hour, four of the five signalized intersections
operate at LOS D or better while MD 85 @ Crestwood Blvd. operated at LOS E. During the PM peak
hour, four of the five signalized intersections operate at LOS E or F while MD 85 @ I-270 Southbound
Ramps operates at LOS D with existing timings.

       The worksheets for all the total build-out capacity analyses without mitigation (Critical Lane
Method and Synchro) are provided in Appendix K.

    Planned Improvements

        As mentioned in Table 5 above, MD 85 @ Crestwood Blvd., MD 85 @ I-270 Southbound Ramps
and MD 85 @ I-270 Northbound Ramps operate at a failing LOS either in the AM or PM or both peaks
under 2015 total build-out conditions. However, as explained in Section III earlier, it should be noted that
SHA has an active project planning study to upgrade MD 85 to a multi-lane divided highway from south of
English Muffin Way to north of Grove Road. The additional capacity proposed under Phase I of this
project would significantly improve the LOS at the three failing intersections cited above. Phase I of the
MD 85 study is currently funded for design only. Hence, these improvements were not included in the
analyses of the 2015 total build-out conditions.

    Mitigation for Total Build-Out Traffic

        The TIA Guidelines require that mitigation options be explored for any intersection operating at
level of service E or F with the Critical Lane Analysis method. The following mitigation options were
analyzed to improve overall traffic flows along MD 85 at these locations:

        MD 85 @ Crestwood Boulevard/Shockley Drive: Several Escrow accounts are in place for
        proposed or previously constructed improvements at this intersection as follows:

               o       #3257 (21555): Third southbound mainline lane on MD 85 between I-270 and Crestwood
                           Cost: $148,000 (basis); $296,000 (inflated)
                           Status: Constructed

               o       #3279 (21584): Added westbound acceleration lane on Crestwood Blvd. to accommodate
                       southbound MD 85 free right turn
                            Cost: $103,870
                            Status: Constructed

               o       #3280 (21585): Exclusive northbound right turn lane on MD 85
                           Cost: $251,339
                           Status: $30,666 accrued; Not constructed

               o       #3281 (21586): Restripe westbound Shockley Drive for an exclusive left turn lane
                           Cost: $77,960
                           Status: $9,512 accrued; Not constructed

               o       #3282: Provide 4th northbound through lane on MD 85
                           Cost: $1,158,300
                           Status: $83,558 accrued; Not constructed

        MD 85 @ I-270 Northbound Ramps: An existing escrow is in place to provide an additional
        northbound left turn lane at this intersection. This improvement will be designed to be consistent
        with the future interchange project for MD 85/I-270 by the SHA.

               o       #3259 (21581): Additional northbound MD 85 left turn and ramp receiving lane
                           Cost: $753,600
                           Status: $105,562 accrued; Not constructed

                                                                 December 2010                                   Page 12 of 21

                                                                                                         Traffic Impact Study       
 
        MD 85 @ I-270 Southbound Ramps: The addition of a second southbound left turn lane at the
        MD 85/I-270 SB Ramps intersection (per Escrow #3258 (21580)) would improve the CLV at this
        intersection from 1,625 to 1,552 at an estimated cost of $753,600 (Escrow amount).

        However, implementation of the proposed SHA interchange design would later remove most of
        the pavement constructed from this improvement.

        The southbound double left would provide minimal improvement to the critical movement (the
        northbound through traffic) ­ a reduction in delay of about 1 second per vehicle.

        Frederick County DPDR and the State Highway Administration have reviewed this Escrow
        improvement and determined that more benefit is gained by providing a reversible lane system
        for this intersection, of three lanes in the peak direction/one lane in the off-peak direction. This
        improvement would provide some temporary relief until the MD 85/I-270 interchange
        improvements are implemented.

        The County has advised that contribution to the current Escrow account, with the reversible lane
        system as the intended improvement, is preferred.

               o       #3258 (21580): Reversible lane system on MD 83
                           Cost: $753,600
                           Status: $102,964 accrued; Not constructed

        In addition to the above mitigation measures, improvements at MD 85 / English Muffin Way are
recommended to accommodate the site traffic. This includes widening the roadway in the northeast
quadrant to provide a larger turning radius for trucks from westbound English Muffin Way to northbound
MD 85. The current turning radius is inadequate for larger trucks, and to make this turn, trucks currently
swing wide into the path of southbound left turning vehicles. With this improvement, trucks could turn right
onto northbound MD 85 without impeding the flow of southbound traffic.

        The proposed improvements are shown in Figure 9.

       The capacity analyses of the total build-out traffic conditions with the above proposed
improvements were performed using the Critical Lane Volume method and Synchro. The results are
summarized in Table 6. For Synchro analysis, the signal timings were optimized with the proposed
improvements in place to reflect future conditions with improvements.

         Based on CLV analyses, during both the AM and PM peak hours, the four intersections where
mitigation measures were considered operate at LOS D or better.

        Based on Synchro analyses, during the AM peak hour, MD 85 @ English Muffin Way, I-270
Southbound Ramps and I-270 Northbound Ramps intersections continue to operate at LOS D or better
while MD 85 @ Crestwood Boulevard continues to operate at LOS E. During the PM peak hour, MD 85 @
English Muffin Way continues to operate at LOS E, MD 85 @ Crestwood Boulevard and MD 85 @ I-270
Northbound Ramps improve to LOS D or better, and I-270 Southbound Ramps intersection improves to
LOS A.

       The worksheets for all total build-out capacity analyses with mitigation (Critical Lane Method and
Synchro) are provided in Appendix L.

VI.       100% Background Traffic Scenario
         The current TIA Guidelines state that: "If no constructed improvements would be required to
satisfy APFO requirements under (the prorated background) traffic scenario, a second scenario assuming
the accounting of trips from all pipeline and pending development, regardless of when it would be
developed, must be analyzed.". For this scenario, the site only needs to mitigate its own CLV contribution
to any failing intersections. Table 7 below provides the site CLV contributions for each intersection for
which mitigation is not already being provided under the previous scenario:

                                                                     Table 7

        Based on the information above, the second analysis scenario (with 100% Background traffic)
applies at the following intersections and peaks, where the site adds more than 15 CLVs (per APFO):

          MD 85 / English Muffin Way ­ PM Peak
          MD 85 / Executive Way ­ AM Peak

         For the second scenario, 100% of all background developments listed were considered. The trip
generation is shown in Table 8 and the trip distribution is the same as under the prorated traffic scenario.
The combined background development (base plus all background developments) traffic volumes for a
typical weekday are shown in Figure 10.

     Total Traffic with 100% Background - Capacity Analyses

        The 2015 total traffic condition with 100% of the background traffic for the weekday AM and PM
peak hours was developed by adding the volumes shown in Figures 10 and 7 and is summarized in
Figure 11. The results for 2015 total traffic conditions are summarized in Table 9.

          MD 85 @ English Muffin Way: Modify the eastbound lane use to provide one left turn lane, a
          shared left/through lane, and a right turn lane. In addition split phasing is required for the east and
          west approaches with this change.

                 o Cost: $16,500 (estimated ­ see appendix N)
        This improvement provides mitigation for the heavy traffic volume growth anticipated on the west
approach of English Muffin Way, due to the approved developments of: Russell Property, University Auto

        With this mitigation measure, the MD 85 / English Muffin Way intersection will operate at level of
service D in the PM peak with a CLV of 1,366. This is a gain of 345 CLVs at the intersection, which more
than mitigates for the site contribution of 19 CLVs.

traffic and mitigation for intersections in Table 9 are provided in Appendix O.

VII.      Traffic Operations along MD 85

       Truck Traffic

         Since the MD 85 study area segment has a significant amount of truck traffic in the existing
condition, and the site traffic contributes additional trucks to the corridor, the increase in truck traffic along
MD 85 was evaluated. Table 10 shows the projected 2015 AADT as well as truck percentage along MD
85 at three critical locations. The 2015 AADT is based on a 3% per year growth* on the 2010 AADT at the
three locations along MD 85. The 2010 AADT is based on SHA's Traffic Volume maps and the existing
truck percentages are based on SHA's Truck Volume maps for year 2009.

         As shown in Table 10, the increase in the truck percentage along MD 85 near English Muffin Way
with the proposed site traffic is about 3%, and near the I-270 interchange the increase is about 1%.

            Drive
*A comparison of the traffic volumes between 2010 Existing and 2015 Combined background Traffic indicates that the growth in
traffic along MD 85 is about 10% near English Muffin Way and about 6% near I-270 Ramps. Hence, the 3% growth that was utilized
to calculate the site truck percentage can be considered conservative.

        In addition, RK&K collected 24-hrs of video at the MD 85 and English Muffin Way intersection on
a October 20, 2010 to better understand the truck percentages along MD 85 during off-peak and midnight
hours. The chart below provides the diurnal truck percentages for this location, which vary from as low as
9% during late evening hours to 36% during early morning hours. Even though there are 12 site trucks
accessing the site during 4:00-5:00PM, the number is close to 0% when compared to overall traffic at the
intersection. As seen in the chart below, the site trucks add a minimal 1 to 3% to the existing truck traffic
at the MD 85 / English Muffin Way intersection.

    Corridor Delay Estimates with Site Traffic

         The Synchro analysis delay totals were reviewed for each of the study area intersections to
determine the site impact on vehicle delay. The FCWTE site traffic does not increase the delay at any of
the study area intersections, either during the AM peak or during the PM peak, except the northbound left
turn at I-270 Northbound Ramps intersection which has an increase in delay of about 14 seconds/vehicle
during the AM peak and about 5 seconds/vehicle during the PM peak. The delay experienced by vehicles
at each of the study area intersections under 2010 existing, 2015 combined background and 2015 total-
build out conditions are shown in the charts below.

       It can be seen from the charts that the increase in delay primarily occurs under the 2015
combined background conditions and moreover, the increase in intersection delay between 2015
combined background and 2015 total build-out is very small.

    Truck Turn Radius at English Muffin Way

         As mentioned in Section II under Observations and acknowledged under mitigation under Section
V, the turn radius in the northeast corner for westbound right turning vehicles from English Muffin Way
appears inadequate for large trucks. This could be an issue for the larger size transfer trailers that will
access the FCWTE facility. As mentioned in Section II under Capacity Analyses, WB-67 is considered the
design vehicle for the FCWTE facility. Hence, turn radii evaluation was performed for the westbound right
turn and southbound left turn movements at MD 85 and English Muffin Way using WB-67 as the design
vehicle. The evaluation was performed in Auto-Turn, a CAD-based program, which allows analysis and
evaluation of vehicle maneuvers for projects such as intersections, roundabouts, bus terminals, loading
bays or any on/off-street assignments involving access, clearance, and maneuverability checks. The
westbound right turns and southbound left turns for WB-67 are shown in Figures 12A thru 12D.

    Traffic Queues at Key Intersections

        As explained under Section IV, the FCWTE site traffic contributes additional trucks to the corridor.
A queuing analyses was performed with Synchro to determine the impacts on the queues with the
additional site traffic. Site trucks contribute traffic to the following turn lanes:

        Southbound left turn lane along MD 85 at English Muffin Way
        Westbound right turn along English Muffin Way at MD 85
        Northbound right turns along MD 85 at I-270 Southbound Ramps
        Northbound left turns along MD 85 at I-270 Northbound Ramps

       The northbound right turns along MD 85 at I-270 Southbound Ramps have an exclusive turn lane
and a channelized free movement, so this movement was excluded from the queuing analysis. The
queuing experienced by vehicles in the remaining turn lanes under 2010 existing, 2015 combined
background, and 2015 total-build out conditions are shown in the charts below.

        As can be seen on the charts, the site traffic does not result in a substantial increase in the queue
lengths at any of these locations. The queuing reports for the MD 85 @ English Muffin Way intersection

    Railroad Crossing on English Muffin Way

        As mentioned earlier under Section II: Existing Conditions, there is an existing railroad crossing
across English Muffin Way approximately 600 feet east of MD 85. The impact of the train crossings
(approximately one per hour) on queuing along eastbound English Muffin Way was determined, due to its
close proximity to MD 85. Synchro/SimTraffic was utilized to analyze the impact of a 4-minute train
crossing event (maximum crossing time observed during field observations in June 2010).

          Two scenarios were analyzed under 2015 Total Build-Out conditions. One was during the non-
site traffic peak (AM peak: 7:00 ­ 8:00 AM) and the other was during site traffic peak (mid-day peak:
12:00 ­ 1:00 PM). Refer to the chart below that shows the site and non-site traffic along eastbound
English Muffin Way between MD 85 and the railroad crossing between the hours of 6:00 AM and 5:00
PM. It should be noted from the chart that the non-site traffic is at its peak when the site traffic is not and
vice versa.

         Based on SimTraffic simulation, for a 4-minute crossing event, the maximum queue along
eastbound English Muffin Way, east of MD 85 is approximately 450 ft. during 7:30-8:30AM when the non-
site traffic along eastbound English Muffin way is at its peak. Similarly, the maximum queue is
approximately 550 ft. during 12:00 ­ 1:00PM when the site traffic along eastbound English Muffin Way is
at its peak. In either case, the queue does not spill back onto MD 85. In addition, during any given hour,
the delay experienced by the site traffic (4 vehicles at most during any given crossing event) is an
additional 4 minutes.

VIII.   Pro-Rata Share Analysis
A Pro-Rata share analysis was completed to determine the reasonable improvement share for the
Frederick-Carroll Waste to Energy site. This was completed in accordance with the TIA Guidelines for
calculating these contributions for site traffic mitigation. The pro-rata shares were calculated using the
formula in the guidelines as follows:


                                                                                                                            December 2010                                                                                                                                                 Page 20 of 21
                                                                                             Frederick Carroll Waste to Energy Facility 
                                                                                                                  Traffic Impact Study       
 

      "The calculation of the pro-rata share contribution, whether it is for future or previously built
      improvements, is based on the proportion of the development's impact to the capacity created by the
      improvement. For instance, if a site adds 10 CLV's to an intersection's LOS and the identified
      improvement required to achieve adequacy improves the intersection by 200 CLV's, the pro-rate
      share of the improvement cost would be 5% or 0.05 times the cost in total fee." Chapter 13, Page 19

Subject:       Frederick County DPDR May 21, 2010 Meeting Minutes


A meeting was held with staff from the Frederick County Division of Permitting and Development
Review (DPDR) and Comprehensive Planning on May 21, 2010 to discuss the scope of a traffic
study for the Frederick County/Carroll County Resource Recovery Facility    McKinney Site to be
located in Frederick County, Maryland. The following people were in attendance:

                    Ron Burns, Frederick County Development Review
                    Betsy Smith, Frederick County Development Review
                    John Thomas, Frederick County Comprehensive Planning
                    Mark Reuss, Wheelabrator Technologies, Inc.

                    Mark Carney, e3rm, llc
                    Barbara Hoage, RK&K
                    Raj Basavaraju, RK&K

Ron Burns opened the meeting by emphasizing that the Frederick Carroll Waste to Energy Facility
does not fall within the APFO guidelines because it is a public facilities improvement. As such, this
site is not subject to impact fees, like a typical private development in the County. This was a
reiteration of Ron's email to Barbara Hoage prior to the meeting, with verification of this from the
County's attorney. As indicated in that email, "Water, sewer and solid waste projects come under §2-
13-3 of the Frederick County Public Local Laws, and "shall not be subject" to subdivision, zoning or
APFO approvals. Public local laws are enacted by the General Assembly, and supersede County
laws." Although the site does not fall under the APFO requirements, Ron, Betsy and John provided
feedback in the meeting as if we are following the standard APFO process for a private development.

The Facility

Mark Reuss provided an introduction of the project including details related to site design and
operations on-site. He indicated that Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority (Authority) is the
"developer". He also indicated that Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is the primary material that will be
handled at the site. He reiterated that the only access into and out of the site will be along English
Muffin Way on the east side of MD 85.

                                                                                          1|Page

Betsy Smith indicated that the removal of cul-de-sac at the end of Metropolitan Court is already
approved. The approval was conditioned on providing a way for traffic to turn around before the
entrance of the WTE facility.

John Thomas expressed concern about impacts to the future Monocacy River Trail that is planned
along the river and adjacent to the subject facility. John indicated that, if possible, there should be a
25 foot buffer from edge of floodplain for the 10 foot paved trail. Mark Reuss stated that a good
alignment for the trail may be along the old utility access road east of the rip rap along the eastern
edge of the site, although this would place it in the floodplain. John said that it may be possible,
although not necessarily desirable, to locate the trail within the floodplain, and also stated that this
section of the trail is not funded within the next 6 years. The County would like to see the floodplain
identified on any site drawings submitted for this study.

Betsy inquired about the implementation timeline for the facility. Mark R. responded that permitting
started in January 2010 which could last about 2 years followed by a 3 year engineering and
construction period. Mark Carney confirmed the timeframe for the State permitting process.

Site Traffic

Barbara Hoage provided an overview of the site traffic patterns and distributions. She provided
handouts to all attendees that included site employee/service traffic, and the MSW daily truck traffic
for various scenarios under year 2015 and year 2046. Mark R. indicated that the truck traffic
projected for Howard and Washington Counties is only as an interim until the Frederick and Carroll
County truck traffic provides 100% of the projected daily MSW capacity for the facility. Mark R. also
indicated that there has been no agreement yet with Howard and Washington Counties.

Barb indicated that the arrivals and departures cited in the site traffic analysis indicated 7-8 AM and
5-6 PM as the peak hours. Ron indicated that the PM peak along MD 85 between I-270 and I-70 is a
"non-traditional" 12-1 PM while south of I-270 is more of a "traditional" 4:30-5:30 PM, so these site
peak hours are appropriate for MD 85 south of the I-270 interchange.

With respect to distribution of traffic along MD 85, there was general agreement among the attendees
that a larger percentage of the traffic, including the transfer trucks, will access the site to/from the
north on MD 85. Ron agreed with Barbara's assumption that there will be some traffic (about 15%)
that will access the site from the south through the MD 85/MD 80 intersection. Ron indicated that
there will be concerns from the Village of Buckeystown about impacts from the truck traffic. Everyone
agreed that trucks from the south will all be route/collection trucks.

Scope

With respect to the number of intersections that need to be included in the scope of the Traffic Impact
Study, Ron indicated that including MD 85/MD 80 intersection may help answer any questions about
traffic impact from residents of Buckeystown. He confirmed that the intersection operates well today.
Ron indicated that the two ramp terminals at the I-270/MD 85 interchange should be included since
the majority of the site traffic will access MD 85 via these ramp terminals. Ron stated that no mainline
I-270 or ramp merge/diverge analysis is needed.

Ron shared with Barbara a Traffic Impact Study report that was done recently for another
development along this corridor that included all the background developments relevant for the
subject Traffic Impact Study. (Barbara is copying the report and will send the original back to Ron as
soon as possible).

Traffic Analysis

Ron suggested that, from the County's perspective, only a Year 2015 traffic analysis is needed. If a
future year analysis is desired, Ron indicated that the traffic should be projected for a 20 year period
(to 2030 and not 2046). Ron also indicated that a link analysis for the MD 85 north of English Muffin
Way would be helpful.

Ron indicated that assuming 100% build-out for all relevant background developments by opening
year is not realistic. Hence, he suggested that a prorated approach should be adopted in calculating
the trips generated by the background developments. For example, West View South development
along Executive Way is a 2 million SF office development phased out over 10 years. Nothing has
been built yet and any construction will likely be at a slow pace due to the economy. Hence, a
prorated build for background development trip generation is acceptable in the County APFO
process and would be a more reasonable approach for this study as well.

Barbara indicated that she compared a 2007 turning movement count at MD 85/English Muffin Way
and a 2009 tube count along MD 85 just north of English Muffin Way, which showed that the 2009
volumes were lower than the 2007 volumes. Ron and Betsy confirmed that there has been a drop in
traffic along MD 85 in recent years due to the upgrades performed along a parallel road west of MD
85 (New Design Road).

Barbara inquired whether any additional counts should be obtained. Ron suggested that re-counting
the volumes along MD 85 intersections would be a good idea, since the new counts are likely to
show less traffic than the 2007 data.

Ron also suggested that the study could use either 1% compounded growth or 3% non-compounded
growth for traffic projections, whichever yields a lower result.

Ron and John indicated that the MARC line that cuts across English Muffin Way just east of MD 85
carries 1 freight train as well as few commuter trains per day.

Mitigation

Ron and Betsy speculated that the construction of I-270/MD 85 interchange will not happen until year
2015. Barbara indicated that RK&K has contacted SHA and obtained the plans for improvements to
the interchange, as well as the travel demand forecasts and Synchro model for the improvements.
RK&K will include the I-270 ramp intersections on MD 85 in the Site Traffic Study, even though
mitigation is not anticipated or required for this project to proceed.

The County handles mitigation by requiring private developers to contribute a prorated amount to an
escrow fund established for the intersection or roadway to be mitigated. Ron and Betsy indicated that
there are existing escrow accounts at MD 85/Crestwood Blvd and MD 85/English Muffin Way. If the
Authority proceeds with any improvements at MD 85/English Muffin Way to better accommodate site
traffic, the escrow money for that intersection could potentially be contributed toward the
improvements.

                          Description:
ENVIRONMENT & COMMUNITY
                          Upgrade MD 85 to a multi-lane divided highway from south of English Muffin Way to north of Grove Road (2.40
                          miles). Wide curb lanes will accommodate bicycles.
      INFO CENTER
                          Scope:
                          The MD 85 Phase 1 interchange project is the first of three projects included in the "MD 85 Planning Study".
      CONTACT US
                          The project includes a new interchange at MD 85 and I-270, along with roadway improvements to MD 85
                          between Spectrum Drive and Crestwood Boulevard. Phase 2 of the Planning Study extends southward from
                          Crestwood Boulevard to English Muffin Way, and includes the replacement of the bridge over Ballenger Creek.
                          Phase 3 extends from Spectrum Drive northward to tie-in with the recently-completed improvements near the
                          MD 85/MD 355 intersection.

                          What is under study:
                          Phase 1 of the project includes upgrading the MD 85 interchange at I-270 and the tie-ins required at Spectrum
                          Drive and Crestwood Boulevard. The interchange design will need to be compatible with long-term
                          improvements proposed as part of the I-270/US 15 Multi-modal Study. The two I-270 bridges over MD 85 will be
                          removed and replaced with a longer, wider structure that can accommodate the additional lanes required on
                          MD 85 to accommodate the design year traffic (2030). Northbound MD 85 will expand from the existing two-
                          lane section under the bridge to five lanes: A double-left that exits to I-270 North, two through lanes, and an
                          acceleration/deceleration lane for the loop ramps. Southbound MD 85 will expand to four lanes: A double-left
                          that exits to I-270 South and two through lanes. Additional space will be included for future expansion of MD 85.

2.2        WASTE RECEIVING, LOAD OBSERVATION, AND TRAFFIC
Waste receiving must be done safely in accordance with FCCRWTE's tipping floor safe-
ty rules and procedures. The waste receiving process is described in the following subsec-
tions.


2.2.1          WASTE RECEIVING
The waste receiving and handling system is designed to maintain a steady flow of waste
into the plant for burning in the combustor and provide an opportunity to inspect the in-
coming waste and remove unacceptable wastes. The waste receiving system consists of
the following components:
                          Platform truck scales.                   Radiation detectors.
                          Tipping floor.                           Front-end loader.
                          Solid waste storage pit.                 Overhead solid waste cranes.
                          Combustor charging hoppers.              Video cameras.


2.2.1.1              Commercial Waste Vehicles
FCCRWTE has been designed to receive on average of 100 to 150 waste vehicles per
day. Commercial vehicles accessing FCCRWTE enter the site from the south at the main
entrance (located on proposed site plan) from the access road. Commercial vehicles must
first pass through a closed-circuit television (CCTV)-monitored gate and security barrier,
then be weighed and proceed to the western side of FCCRWTE following signage direct-
ing disposal vehicles to the receiving building. At the receiving building, self-unloading
vehicles drive onto the floor, turn, and back into the tipping bay to discharge their solid
waste directly onto the tipping floor or directly into the solid waste storage pit. Following
disposal of their waste, vehicles typically exit the tipping floor area and proceed back to
the outbound scale for weight measurement and then proceed back through the security
barrier gate and exit to the access road. Alternate routes may be used for vehicles that do
not need to be reweighed.


2.2.1.2              Platform Truck Scales
There are two platform truck scales, one for incoming trucks and one for exiting trucks.
They are located on the east side of the plant on the entrance road. The scales are elec-

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   2-3               Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
tronic, load-cell-type platform scales. Scale house instrumentation provides information
regarding the gross, known tare, or net weight of a truck on the scale. The scale is auto-
matically operated with a remote station in the plant.


FCCRWTE is designed to operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.


2.2.1.3              Truck Turnaround Time
Waste delivery vehicles entering the site are managed in an efficient manner to prevent
undue wait times. There are six tipping bays in the waste receiving building that can ac-
cept vehicles. In most practical situations, there can be multiple vehicles on the tipping
floor offloading waste, provided that safety protocols are being followed. There is also a
truck tipper located in the receiving area where trailers can be offloaded. FCCRWTE de-
sign includes multilane entry and exit from the receiving floor to help mitigate any surges
in traffic flow. Traffic is controlled at the truck scales, and high traffic flows are queued
on the delivery road prior to the receiving floor entrance. This should reduce traffic back-
up at the entrance to the tipping floor for vehicles entering or exiting the tipping floor. As
a contingency to prevent truck traffic backing up past the entrance in the event of multi-
ple vehicles arriving at the same time, trucks can queue on the plant perimeter road, start-
ing at the entrance to the tipping building. The perimeter road is designed to be three
lanes wide to accommodate queuing without interfering with other plant traffic. The max-
imum expected total number of trucks that could queue on the site's perimeter road is
70 route collection trucks or 39 tractor trailers with a wheelbase of 67 ft between the front
and rearmost axle (WB-67). The length of outside inward lane from the main entrance
gate to the entry door of the tipping floor building is 1,920 ft. Using the middle lane and
beginning at a point south of the scales, there is an additional roadway of 1,597 ft. A
combination of route collection and tractor trailers can be safely accommodated onsite.
These efforts and design characteristics support an efficient waste receiving area to keep
traffic moving in a timely manner.


FCCRWTE's roadways are designed specifically to handle the largest trucks that will be
delivering the solid waste (i.e., transfer trailers). All other vehicles are smaller and should
be able to navigate the roadway geometrics. According to the traffic impact study con-

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   2-4          Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
ducted by Rummel, Klepper & Kahl, LLP, peak nondelivery vehicles will be 26 per hour,
which coincides with work shift changes. Average hour volume for nonwaste delivery
vehicles is less than one per hour. The roadways are designed to handle the deliveries of
reagents and chemicals as well as access to all building parking areas and entrances. Stop
signs are used at entrances to the perimeter road to control entering traffic without dis-
rupting the main traffic flow. The perimeter road from the entrance to the scale can hold
from 5 to 10 trucks, depending on the mix of collection trucks and transfer trailer trucks.
This is more than adequate to keep traffic flowing toward the tipping floor, because the
weighing process takes approximately 1 minute.


Although safety of tipping floor operations is the primary concern and must be main-
tained at all times, proper untarping and dumping procedures of vehicles differs by type
of vehicle. Large vehicles with walking floors will take longer to complete a dumping
cycle then an automated truck due to the very nature and operation of the vehicle. The
goal of FCCRWTE is to process waste trucks as quickly as can be safely accomplished,
with a target of 30 minutes or less. Frederick and Carroll Counties have been requested to
stage delivery of vehicles to the extent practical to minimize congestion at FCCRWTE.


2.2.1.4              Noise
Noise generated at FCCRWTE results from operation of the various facilities, process
components, and the operation of vehicles on the site during fuel delivery, loading, and
related operations. Specific sources of noise include:
                        Trucking of municipal solid waste (MSW) to the site.
                        Loading and unloading at the site, including maintenance vehicles maneu-
                        vering within the enclosed tipping floor area and the ash/metal recovery
                        building.
                        Forced and induced draft fans and associated motors in the combustion sys-
                        tem.
                        Building ventilation systems.
                        Material handling (ash, lime, and carbon-based sorbent) equipment (includ-
                        ing air pollution control equipment) throughout the site.


Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   2-5                  Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
                        Tipping bay, solid waste storage pit, combustor/boiler, air quality control
                        system (AQCS), warehouse/maintenance, ash/metal recovery, and tur-
                        bine/generator buildings with miscellaneous internal equipment.
                        Mechanical draft cooling towers (three cells).
                        Switchyard, transformers and other electrical equipment throughout the site.


If excessive noise is noted at FCCRWTE, the shift supervisor or control room is notified
immediately. Facility personnel will attempt to determine the source of the noise without
risking the health and safety of plant personnel and determine whether or not it is coming
from FCCRWTE. If the noise is determined to be coming from FCCRWTE, the shift su-
pervisor is to make every attempt to eliminate the noise. The need for additional noise
control is determined by the shift supervisor on an as-needed basis. If this is not possible,
the operations manager and EH&S manager are then notified immediately.


There are currently systems in place to prevent noise while venting steam. The combus-
tor/boiler operation startup and shutdown procedures are used to ensure the emergency
relief valves (outfitted with silencers) are operated to minimize noise caused from venting
steam. Safety valves, used to protect from overpressure of the steam system and vessels,
are typically only used during emergency situations. Testing of this safety system will be
coordinated with local officials.


2.2.1.5              Odor
Odor control in the tipping bay building, sewage sludge building, and solid waste storage
pit areas will be achieved by maintaining these areas under negative pressure using the
combustor/boilers' primary air system. The combustor/boilers' primary air system will
thermally destroy any odors created in these areas. FCCRWTE also works to minimize
odor propagation by continually rotating the pit inventory so older waste is disposed of as
quickly as practical. If excessive odor is noted at the FCCRWTE property line, the shift
supervisor or control room is notified immediately. Facility personnel will attempt to de-
termine the source of the odor without risking the health and safety of Facility personnel
and determine whether or not the odor is coming from FCCRWTE. Wind direction,
weather, and use of a confined space meter may be used to determine if the smell is haz-

ardous or not. If the odor is determined to be coming from FCCRWTE, the shift supervi-
sor will make every attempt to remove the odor by closing doors where possible. Control
of odor needs to be determined by the shift supervisor on an as-needed basis. In the event
there is a persistent excessive odor at FCCRWTE property line that cannot be resolved by
the shift supervisor, the operations manager and EH&S manager are notified immediate-
ly.


2.2.1.6              Vector Control
Pests and vermin will be controlled by keeping waste contained in the solid waste storage
pit as much as possible and following the standard procedure of constantly mixing the
waste in the solid waste storage pit with the overhead crane. Consistent and efficient op-
eration of the boiler is important to successful long-term plant operations. To achieve this
goal, a waste storage management plan will be followed that will rotate the waste in the
solid waste storage pit. Each day operating personnel will stack the incoming waste from
the trucks in designated areas of the solid waste storage pit and feed waste from other ar-
eas of the solid waste storage pit. This waste storage/rotation plan is followed from shift
to shift and is coordinated with the management team at the Facility. This allows time for
a better mix of waste prior to feeding and provides drainage time for any wet solid waste
that is entering the Facility. Rotating the solid waste storage pit inventory on a consistent
basis reduces pests and contributes to more consistent boiler operations. In addition, a
local licensed pest control company will be retained for scheduled monthly treatments to
maintain pest control.


A high standard for housekeeping is a strong element of the facility's pest control pro-
gram. Appropriate disposal containers will be stationed throughout the facility to assist in
maintaining the cleanliness within the plant. These will be closed lid wherever possible to
reduce the opportunity for proliferation of pests.


The tipping floor is maintained in a clean manner each day with the use of the front-end
loader equipped with a rubber blade on the bucket to protect the floor from excessive
wear.

All vehicles exiting the tipping hall will be visually observed by the traffic controller to
ensure no waste is dragged from the building by the vehicle itself. It is the responsibility
of each driver using the site to ensure that their vehicle is clean and clear of detritus upon
exiting the facility. These procedures will be provided to all drivers during their site in-
duction. Procedures will also ensure that no food or drink is left outside onsite to help
minimize pests and vermin.


2.2.1.7              Fire, Explosion, or Other Emergency
If a major fire, explosion, or other emergency occurs, personnel will immediately notify
the control room/shift supervisor of the incident. The emergency evacuation alarm is
sounded (both audible and visual alarms) when instructed by the shift supervisor.
Nonshift personnel truck drivers, contractors, and visitors, are to evacuate the building at
that time. Non-Facility personnel will muster at a clearly marked location. On-duty shift
personnel are required to muster at the primary evacuation location unless otherwise in-
structed by the shift supervisor and become the incipient response team. The situation
status is reported to the control room by the response team leader. The responders are
then to adhere to their appropriate responsibilities. The shift supervisor ensures that the
plant manager and operations manager are notified and apprised of the situation. Appro-
priate fire department personnel are contacted as determined by the shift supervisor based
on the on-scene conditions.


2.2.1.8              Radiation Detectors
A radiation meter is installed at the scale house to detect radiation sources in the incom-
ing waste. An alarm is sounded in the scale house and control room on detection of radia-
tion. The truck is then detained, and the appropriate state agencies are notified, as neces-
sary.


2.2.1.9              Tipping Floor
The tipping floor provides ample space for solid waste trucks to unload waste, pull out,
and exit the receiving building. Operations on the tipping floor will be conducted in man-
ner such that a truck may be directed to an area near the solid waste storage pit, but sepa-
rate from the ongoing unloading operations, for the observation of the load. There is a

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   2-8         Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
tipper in the tipping building to allow tipping of transfer trailers that are not self-
unloading.


2.2.1.10             Front-End Loader
The front-end loader operator (tipping floor loader operator) directs the tipping floor op-
erations. His job is to minimize truck unloading and turnaround times. The tipping floor
loader operator observes the waste as it is unloaded into the tipping floor. During these
observations, the tipping floor loader operator looks for wastes that are banned by regula-
tion or permit or that can cause operational problems. Unacceptable wastes are removed
for offsite disposal before the waste is pushed into the solid waste storae pit, as further
described in Section 3.0. In the event that unacceptable waste is not discovered on the
tipping floor and finds its way to the pit, the tipping floor employees will contact the shift
supervisor. The shift supervisor is to consider safety ramifications when determining the
best course of action. The front-end loader is also used to clean the tipping floor of waste.


The primary loader, used for the tipping operation, is stored in the tipping bay building
when not in service. A secondary loader, used as backup to the primary loader and also
used in the ash building operation to load/move recovered materials, is stored in the ash
and metals recover building. Routine loader preventive maintenance is conducted in-
doors. When major repairs are required, the primary or secondary loader is sent offsite to
a service center. Other mobile support equipment, including fork lift trucks and small
front-end loaders (Bobcat or similar), is stored and maintained indoors in designated are-
as of the process or maintenance building. The facility small pickup truck is parked in a
facility parking spot when not in use.


2.2.1.11             Solid Waste Storage Pit
The dimensions of the solid waste storage pit are 150 ft long, 70 ft wide, and 38 ft deep
from the tipping floor to the bottom of the pit. The solid waste storage storage pit is sized
for a nominal 1,500-tpd solid waste storage delivery. The pit will provide 5 days of stor-
age at 1,500 tpd if the solid waste storage is stacked in accordance with the specification
requirement (minimum of two-thirds of the total storage volume to be below the tipping
floor and not more than one-third of the total volume above the pit to the level of the

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   2-9         Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
charging hoppers). A solid waste storage density of 700 pounds per cubic yard is ex-
pected and was used to size the pit.


2.2.1.12             Overhead Solid Waste Cranes
Two overhead cranes provide a means of transporting the waste from the storage pit to
the combustor charging hoppers. Both cranes are located above the solid waste storage
pit. These are track-mounted cranes (gantry cranes) equipped with orange peel grapples.
The solid waste cranes are also used to sort/remove any oversize bulky waste from the
pit. The cranes will transfer waste from the solid waste storage pit to the combustor feed
hoppers. The cranes will also be used to redistribute and fluff the waste to create a more
optimum mixture for combustion. From the feed hoppers, the waste falls onto a feeder
table, and a hydraulic ram pushes the waste onto the combustor grates.


The crane control area is located on the east side of the solid waste storage pit inside the
crane control room. The crane control room windows offer operators an unobstructed
view of the entire pit area. A video monitor provides a view of the receiving bay doors.
Remote video cameras are strategically located above the solid waste feed hoppers and
service bays to assist the crane operators in positioning the grapples.


The crane operators use a two-way communication system to alert the main control room
operators of an upset condition or to receive instructions on feeding the charging hoppers
during an emergency.


2.2.1.13             Combustor Charging Hoppers
The combustor charging hoppers are used to supply waste into the furnace for combus-
tion. There are two charging hoppers, one for each combustor. Each of the hoppers is
supplied with waste from either of the two overhead cranes.


In addition to keeping the charging hoppers filled with trash, crane operators also monitor
the feed hoppers for a bridge condition that blocks flow of trash feed to the combustor. If
this condition occurs, the crane operators can activate a hydraulic swing gate in the feed
hopper chute.

2.2.1.14             Video Cameras
Video cameras provide monitoring for hopper feeding, receiving area fire prevention, and
truck traffic safety. The crane operators share responsibility for tipping floor monitoring
with the tipping floor loader operator. Video cameras provide the crane and control room
operators with a means to monitor areas of the plant not directly in their eyesight. The
crane operator has video cameras that monitor the level within the combustor charging
hoppers for feeding purposes and allow constant monitoring of the tipping floor.


The video cameras operate continuously. Cameras located at the entrance and exit of the
plant are used to pan the entire area. Cameras over the charging hoppers show the level of
the charging hopper.


2.2.2           LOAD OBSERVATION PROCEDURES
At least four times per shift, a random load observation is performed by plant personnel
to screen loads delivered to the tipping floor for unacceptable materials. Load observa-
tions are performed by trained personnel, generally the tipping floor loader operator.


2.2.3           RECORDKEEPING
Load observation training documentation will be kept on file in the EH&S manager's of-
fice. Records of load observations will be maintained by the EH&S manager.


Records will be electronically stored in a central database. If a hardcopy is required on-
site, it will be stored and protected from loss, deterioration, and damage. When space
does not permit onsite retention, records will be stored offsite or stored electronically af-
ter scanning and processing. Records will be maintained for a minimum of 7 years except
as required by specific governing plans or procedures. All records will be available for
review in accordance with contracts or regulatory requirements. Records will include, but
will not be limited to:
                        Plant operating statistics and logs.
                        Compliance reporting associated with Title V and refuse disposal permits'
                        requirements.

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   2-11             Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
                        Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) records.
                        Employee training records.
                        Waste load inspections.
                        Spill management records.
                        Stormwater and groundwater monitoring plans.
                        Environmental policy and plans.
                        Facility permits, including state and local regulatory requirements.


2.2.4           OTHER TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT
2.2.4.1              Commercial Delivery Vehicles
Bottom ash, fly ash, and metal recovery vehicles and lime and carbon-based sorbent de-
livery vehicles enter the FCCRWTE site using the same route as the waste delivery vehi-
cles and, after being weighed, will turn westerly following the road toward the ash and
metal recovery building or their respective material unloading areas. Once load-
ed/unloaded, the vehicles return through the scales and exit FCCRWTE through the main
entrance.


Service vehicles may access FCCRWTE by turning left after passing the scale. The ser-
vice vehicle road follows the perimeter access road system. Service vehicles leaving
FCCRWTE follow the service vehicle access road past the scale before exiting.


After the ash trucks have been loaded, they are to pass through the wheel wash and then
exit the building on the south side. The wheel wash station wastewater, one of the miscel-
laneous services water uses shown on the water balance diagram depicted in Figure 4-11
of the engineering report. This water balance shows how water within FCCRWTE is used
and includes contact water. Water that comes in contract with the ash will be collected
and managed in the contact water system as depicted on the drawing and will not be dis-
charged into the stormwater collection system.


The wheel wash station will be located at the southwest corner of the ash and metal re-
covery building. Trucks will enter the ash and metal recovery building at the northwest


Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   2-12                 Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
corner of the building and proceed directly to the wheel wash station after loading. The
wheel wash station consists of a concrete pad with trench drains, sump pit, pumps, buffer
tank, photo eyes, and spinner nozzle sprayers. The concrete pad will be sloped toward the
trench drains to collect all wash water from the station. Nozzle sprays will direct spray
wash water in a northerly direction (toward the interior of the ash and metal recovery
building) as the truck travels in a southerly direction through the station. Water and sedi-
ment will be collected in the trench drain and flow to a sump pit. All trench drain and
sump pit covers will be removable so as to provide maintenance access to the trenches,
sump pit, and sump pumps. Water and sediment collected in the sump pit will be pumped
directly to the contact water treatment building.


2.2.4.2              Employee and Visitor Parking
Visitors and administrative personnel accessing FCCRWTE proceed through the first en-
try way from the access road following signs to the visitor parking area and administra-
tion building. These visitors park and then proceed to the administration offices located in
the main building via the walkway from the parking area to the building. A CCTV system
monitors the staff and visitor entrance, and a gate is provided as a security barrier after
normal business hours to prevent vehicles from proceeding past the administration build-
ing.


Facility personnel parking is located east of the administration building as well as the
north and west sides of the plant. FCCRWTE personnel park in any of these three areas
and proceed into the Facility via the walkway from the Facility personnel parking lots to

                              3.0 MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC WASTE TYPES


The text to follow discusses the management of the following specific waste types:
             ·          Bulky wastes.                       ·   Compressed gas cylinders.
             ·          CFC-containing appliances.          ·   Other unacceptable wastes, including
             ·          Hot/smoldering loads.                   suspected hazardous wastes.
             ·          Infectious waste.                   ·   Special wastes.
             ·          Radioactive loads.


3.1        BULKY WASTE PROCEDURES
Because of the combustor feed chute width, FCCRWTE does not accept articles larger
than 6 ft in any dimension. However, the tipping floor operator can use discretion and
accept particular large items, such as sofas, that can be easily broken up with the loader
or crane. Rejected bulky wastes should be reloaded onto the delivery truck, if possible.
Bulky wastes discovered after the delivery truck has left should be placed in the bulky
waste roll-off or stored in a safe location on the tipping floor. Large metal objects such as
water heaters will be placed into the metals roll-off. Rejected bulky wastes will be dis-
posed of offsite. CFC-containing appliances will be handled and disposed of in accord-
ance with FCCRWTE CFC-containing appliance procedures.


3.2        CFC-CONTAINING APPLIANCE HANDLING PROCEDURES
CFCs are gasses that are in a liquid state when under pressure in an appliance. They are
generally colorless and odorless. CFCs were used as refrigerants in air conditioners,
freezers, refrigerators, heat pumps, water coolers, vending machines, and similar devices.
CFCs that escape into the atmosphere are harmful because they deplete the stratospheric
ozone layer. Although CFC production ceased on January 1, 1996, many CFC-containing
appliances are still in use.


Disposal of these appliances is controlled by environmental regulations to prevent CFC
releases. Strict compliance with this plan will insure FCCRWTE operates in accordance
with environmental regulations. The highlights of this plan are summarized in the follow-
ing subsections.

3.2.1           HANDLING CFC-CONTAINING APPLIANCES
Handle CFC-containing appliances as if they were undamaged and contained a full CFC
charge. Careful handling applies to all CFC-containing appliances, even appliances that
are damaged, have cut or punctured lines, or are missing refrigerant parts. If possible,
CFC-containing appliances should be carefully reloaded onto the delivery truck. If re-
loading the appliance is not possible, the appliance must be handled as follows:
                        The appliance is carefully moved to a secure area on or near the tipping
                        floor in a manner that protects the appliance's pressure parts (generally the
                        back or bottom) from further damage.
                        Careful handling may include the following:
                        o          Using a hand truck.
                        o          Gently pushing the appliance on its side or front with a front-end load-
                                   er bucket.
                        o          Carrying the appliance in the front-end loader bucket and unloading
                                   the bucket by hand or by gently tipping the bucket.


3.2.2           ONSITE CFC RECOVERY AND OFFSITE FINAL DISPOSAL
A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-certified technician using EPA-certified
equipment is used to inspect CFC-containing appliances and recover CFCs. Inspection
records and CFC recovery certificates are obtained from the CFC recovery technician
during each site visit.


FCCRWTE personnel ensure that the CFC recovery technician places a sticker on the
appliance confirming that it is free of CFCs. Placing a sticker on the appliances does not
replace the requirement for keeping the inspection and recovery records.


After obtaining inspection and recovery records certifying that the appliance is free of
CFCs, the appliance is placed in FCCRWTE's scrap metal bin. Careful handling re-
quirements no longer apply after the CFCs have been recovered, and crushing is permit-
ted.

Environmental regulations impose several recordkeeping requirements that will be ad-
dressed in a CFC management plan.


3.3        HOT LOAD PROCEDURES
The shift supervisor is immediately notified upon discovery of a truck with a load that is
smoldering, smoking, or burning. The shift supervisor instructs the control room operator
to call 911. The shift supervisor instructs the scale operator to have the driver of the hot
load drive off the scale and wait for further instructions. The tipping floor loader operator
begins to clear the tipping floor of any trucks and MSW as quickly as possible. The fol-
lowing information should be made available to the 911 operator:
                        Exact location of the emergency.
                        Telephone number from which the call is being made.
                        Caller's name.
                        Nature of the emergency (for example, a hot load has arrived at the plant).
                        MSW truck size and type.
                        Injuries (if any).
                        What the plant is doing to address the situation.
                        Other organizations FCCRWTE has notified.


A qualified person is designated to stand by at the front gate to assist in traffic control of
incoming and outgoing MSW trucks, maintaining a clear route for the fire trucks to the
tipping floor.


The shift supervisor instructs qualified firefighting personnel to suit-up in firefighting
turn-out gear and self-contained breathing apparatuses. Firefighting personnel will as-
semble outside the tipping floor on the access road.


The shift supervisor charges the tipping floor fire hose stations and has the firefighting
team lay out fire hose from the hose stations. The lead mechanic oversees the fire pump.
Once the tipping floor is clear of trucks and MSW, the hot load is directed to the tipping
floor.


Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   3-3                 Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
Depending on the severity of the hot load, the container of the truck may be doused with
a fog spray. The fuel tanks, oil tanks, hydraulic lines, tires, and parts of the truck needed
to keep it operational are monitored.


Once the fire department is on the site, all information is communicated to the onsite fire
department commander.


3.4        INFECTIOUS WASTE HANDLING PROCEDURES
FCCRWTE procedures for responding to suspected infectious waste deliveries are found
in the Facility exposure control plan for bloodborne pathogens, which also includes a pro-
tocol for handling discovered medical waste. Infectious waste must also be handled in
accordance with the state's infectious waste regulations. The following paragraphs pro-
vide an overview of policy and regulatory requirements.


An employee who discovers suspected infectious waste on the tipping floor must imme-
diately notify the shift supervisor. Suspected infectious waste includes bags from com-
mercial or institutional sources containing:
                        Syringes, bandages, culture dishes, etc.
                        Red bags.
                        Bags marked with the international biohazard symbol.


Bags marked with the biohazard symbol are presumed to be infectious wastes and must
be managed in accordance with FCCRWTE's bloodborne pathogens plan. Red bags or
other trash bags suspected of containing infectious wastes are investigated by the shift
supervisor to determine if they actually contain regulated infectious wastes. The tipping
floor loader operator and other hourly employees are not authorized to open bags of sus-
pected infectious wastes.


When conducting the investigation, the shift supervisor must wear the personal protective
equipment (PPE) specified under the exposure control plan for bloodborne pathogens
(i.e., rubber gloves, leather gloves, dust mask, uniform, safety boots, Tyvek® suit, safety

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   3-4                  Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
vest). Supervisors must not open bags with their hands. They will instead use tools, such
as rakes and barbeque tongs, to open bags and examine their contents.


If the bag(s) is marked with the biohazard symbol or if the shift supervisor determines
that the bag(s) is likely infectious wastes, then the bag(s) must be immediately placed in
the designated infectious waste bin on the tipping floor. Infectious waste is not to be re-
loaded into the garbage truck. Suspected infectious wastes are not to be handled with bare
hands. Tools that contact suspected infectious wastes must be decontaminated with
bleach after use, pursuant to the suspected infectious waste deliveries procedure.


Attempts must be made to determine the source of the infectious waste, either by inspec-
tion of other wastes in the bag, questioning the driver that delivered the waste, or both. If
identified, the generator must be contacted so they can retrieve the infectious wastes. If
the generator cannot be identified, the wastes should be disposed of through a registered,
licensed infectious waste disposal company.


3.5        RADIOACTIVE LOAD PROCEDURES
FCCRWTE is equipped with radiation detectors at the scale house to ensure radioactive
wastes are not accepted for disposal. The most likely radioactive materials present in the
MSW are medical radionuclides (e.g., in adult diapers). Loads that trigger the scale house
radiation alarm must be handled in accordance with FCCRWTE's radiation protection,
action, and monitoring plan. The following paragraphs briefly discuss the contents of the
plan. If a truck triggers the radiation alarm, FCCRWTE employees should consult the
radiation plan for detailed instructions.


In the event that a delivery triggers the radiation alarm, the following steps are taken:
                        Immediately notify the control room, which will notify the shift supervisor.
                        The shift supervisor must notify the operations manager and the EH&S
                        manager.
                        The shift supervisor (or designee) will direct the truck to approach the scale
                        again to insure the alarm was not false. The shift supervisor may also screen
                        the truck with a hand held detector.

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   3-5                  Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
                        If the alarm is confirmed, the truck is directed to park in a designated, isolat-
                        ed holding area. The truck is not allowed on the tipping floor.
                        The driver is informed of the radiation alarm and asked to get out of the
                        truck to limit their potential radiation exposure.
                        The driver is informed that the truck must stay parked until the radioactive
                        material is recovered or the load is deemed not a threat. The driver is further
                        informed that the police will be called if attempt is made to exit the site be-
                        fore clearance is obtained.


The shift supervisor (or designee) will record the following information (as available) on
FCCRWTE's radiation detection report form:
                        Driver's name.
                        Trucking company name (or community).
                        Truck's license plate number.
                        Truck number assigned by FCCRWTE (decal number).
                        Time and date the load arrived at FCCRWTE.
                        Origin of the load.
                        Radiation detector reading(s).


The EH&S manager will notify the MDE Radiological Health Department and Solid
Waste Administration of the radioactive load per EH&S standard operating proce-
dure 0004. If the EH&S manager is unavailable, the notification will be made by the
plant manager, operations manager, or shift supervisor, who will provide the information
recorded by the shift supervisor.


3.6        COMPRESSED GAS CYLINDERS HANDLING PROCEDURES
Small propane tanks of the type used for barbeque grills are the most common type of
compressed gas cylinders found in MSW. Compressed gas bottles from households are
not considered hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the cylinders might explode when heated
in the combustor/boiler and can potentially damage FCCRWTE equipment. Efforts must
be made to identify and remove compressed gas cylinders from the waste. If possible,


Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   3-6                    Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
compressed gas cylinders should be reloaded onto the delivery truck. If the delivery truck
cannot be identified, the cylinder should be securely stored to prevent damage. The cyl-
inder must be disposed of offsite.


However, other cylinders are also occasionally encountered. Compressed gas bottles from
commercial or institutional sources are potentially hazardous waste. These bottles must
be removed from the waste and, if possible, reloaded onto the truck that delivered them.
If the commercial or institutional generator cannot be determined, FCCRWTE may need
to manage the bottle as a hazardous waste. If this situation arises, FCCRWTE's EH&S
manager is contacted immediately.


3.7        SUSPECTED HAZARDOUS WASTES AND OTHER UNACCEPTABLE
           WASTES HANDLING PROCEDURES
In addition to the unacceptable wastes previously described, Facility permits and envi-
ronmental regulations also prevent FCCRWTE from accepting unburnable demolition
debris, motor vehicle parts, and hazardous wastes.


Usually the tipping floor loader operator can easily identify unacceptable waste. Occa-
sionally, suspicious waste may arrive on the tipping floor that is difficult to categorize.
Determining whether a particular waste is a hazardous waste can be especially difficult.
In these cases, the tipping floor loader operator is to consult with the EH&S manager
and/or shift supervisor to determine whether the waste will be accepted.


In general, rejected wastes are reloaded onto the delivery truck of origin. If the delivery
vehicle or generator cannot be identified, FCCRWTE takes possession of the waste and
must manage it properly. The unacceptable waste is removed to the designated area on
the tipping floor. The tipping floor loader operator immediately informs the shift supervi-
sor of the situation. If the rejected waste is a suspected hazardous waste, the shift supervi-
sor immediately notifies the EH&S manager. Notification of the Northeast Maryland
Waste Disposal Authority (NEA) will also be made.




Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   3-7         Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
Hazardous wastes are to be properly labeled, stored, and disposed. The EH&S manager
will advise operators on the requirements specific to the type of waste rejected. The event
is recorded into FCCRWTE's operating record or waste issues log, and MDE is notified
as appropriate.


MDE will be notified if an unacceptable solid waste is found to have been accepted at
FCCRWTE. MDE will be contacted immediately (within 24 hours) at (410) 337-3315, or
(866) 633-4868 after working hours, of all incidents of discovery of any unacceptable
solid wastes in a load of solid waste. MDE will be notified with a written report within
5 working days following discovery. If the source of waste is unknown, the written report
will include the circumstances of the discovery, a description of efforts to secure and con-
trol the solid waste and any release of pollutants from the solid waste, and current loca-
tion and final disposition of the solid waste.


3.8        SPECIAL WASTES HANDLING PROCEDURES
Special wastes are typically loads of a single waste type from a single source. Examples
of special waste include a truckload of off-specification consumer goods from a manufac-
turer or a drug burn for the local police department. FCCRWTE can only accept wastes
that are allowable under environmental regulations, FCCRWTE's permits, and the com-
pany's contract with the owner of the Facility. Special wastes might also pose handling
challenges. This O&M plan includes FCCRWTE's procedures for ensuring that banned
wastes are not accepted and special wastes are properly handled.


3.8.1           SPECIAL WASTES GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Special wastes that meet the following criteria can be processed at FCCRWTE:
                        Waste must be compatible with FCCRWTE's equipment.
                        Waste must be capable of being safely processed and must not create a haz-
                        ard or nuisance on the tipping floor (e.g., waste that is too large for the com-
                        bustor feed chute).
                        Waste must be processible under environmental regulations and
                        FCCRWTE's permits.
                        Waste must not significantly affect air quality or ash content.

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   3-8                   Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
Special wastes must go through a formal evaluation before they are accepted at
FCCRWTE.


3.8.2          SPECIAL WASTES DELIVERY SCHEDULING
An approved special waste type code is assigned to each special waste customer, and the
customer uses this code to schedule loads. The special waste code allows FCCRWTE to
match each particular special waste to that waste's approval profile and also ensures
proper billing. Special waste shipments are to be scheduled with FCCRWTE before de-
livery using the Facility's preshipment notification document. After a delivery schedule is
established, the customer is to provide a list of the specific wastes that will be delivered.
This customer's list is checked against the wastes that FCCRWTE agrees to accept. The
waste is also inspected upon delivery to verify that the wastes have been previously ap-
proved by FCCRWTE.


3.8.3          SPECIAL WASTES CONTAINERS
FCCRWTE can typically accept bulk waste in roll-off containers, dump trailers, or box
trailers. Waste loads requiring direct feed are to be palletized and, if possible, delivered in
walking floor trailers. Waste delivery personnel are to comply with the tipping floor re-
quirements, and these requirements are to be discussed with delivery personnel before
they enter the tipping floor.


3.8.4          SPECIAL WASTES LOAD VERIFICATION
Waste delivered in roll-off containers and dump trailers is usually dumped into the tip-
ping floor for observation before being pushed into the pit. Visual observations are made,
and samples may be taken to verify the delivered waste conforms to the profile. If a waste
sample is taken, FCCRWTE does not typically wait for the results of the analysis before
disposing of the waste in the pit. Waste observations are documented on FCCRWTE's
random waste/special waste observation form.


Certain wastes, such as pharmaceuticals, may require more labor-intensive quality assur-
ance/quality control (QA/QC). Typically, a portion or all of the waste from such loads is

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   3-9          Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
directly fed into the combustor/boiler feed hopper and not pushed into the pit. The service
elevator or an auxiliary crane hoist may be used to deliver the waste to the combus-
tor/boiler feed hopper. Part of the QA/QC process is to identify each individually profiled
waste on the truck and handle them accordingly. This requires that nonbulk wastes be
properly labeled so they are readily identifiable during the unloading process.


3.8.5           NONCONFORMING SPECIAL WASTES
Special wastes that do not conform to their approved profile are rejected and sent back to
the customer. Every attempt is made to determine if the waste conforms with the profile
before the delivery vehicle is sent back. If the delivery vehicle has left FCCRWTE, the
customer may be required to arrange for a truck to return to FCCRWTE to pick up the
nonconforming wastes.


3.8.6           ASSURED DESTRUCTION PROCEDURES
There are two levels of assurance for special waste deliveries that require assured de-
struction. First, for less sensitive wastes, the generator may accept delivery of the waste
into the solid waste storage pit as verification of assured destruction. Second, for wastes
where a higher certainty of immediate destruction is required, the wastes can be lifted
from the tipping floor or carried through FCCRWTE and placed directly into the solid
waste feed hoppers. If the generator's representative requires visual confirmation that the
wastes have been fed into the combustor, they can be taken to the crane control room to
observe. If the generator or their designee needs to observe a lock or seal on the waste
shipment, then they must comply with tipping floor requirements.


3.8.7           SPECIAL WASTES RECORDKEEPING PROCEDURES
For special wastes accepted by FCCRWTE, the following records of each shipment are
kept for at least 5 years:
                        Waste profile sheet and supporting documentation.
                        Delivery date.
                        Waste generator's company name and address.
                        Waste description.

                        Weight of waste.
                        Additional information required by permit or regulatory approval.

                                 4.0 MSW STORAGE AND PIT MANAGEMENT


4.1        NORMAL OPERATIONS
FCCRWTE's pit management strategy maintains the following objectives:
                        Plan for flow, control, and storage of incoming waste.
                        Provide adequate mixing of fuel feed to the boilers so fuel quality is as con-
                        sistent as possible.
                        Provide for safe operation by minimizing the risk of fire in the solid waste
                        storage pit and minimizing dust and overhead hazard exposures.
                        Provide for consistency in operations by standardizing methods of pit man-
                        agement among different operators.


Waste is normally stored in the pit only. During special or unusual circumstances, includ-
ing but not limited to, an unscheduled boiler outage or spring cleanups, waste deliveries
may exceed waste processing capacity and, therefore, will require storage of some waste
on the tipping floor. At least one bay is to be maintained open for waste receiving either
by depositing into the pit directly or in front of the pit for the loader to push the material
into the pit.


Waste may be stored on the tipping floor on a short-term basis as allowed FCCRWTE's
refuse disposal permit. During normal operation, waste may be present on the tipping
floor until room is available in the pit for the tipping floor loader operator to push it in.
Facility personnel ensure at all times that the temporary storage poses neither a threat to
health and safety nor the environment.


The waste in the pit is rotated on a biweekly basis. Therefore, on alternate weekends, the
waste in each end of the pit is to be mixed and managed for fuel feeding to prevent the
aging and decomposition of the waste within the storage pit. Control of the pit inventory
is required to ensure adequate rotation of the waste.


Tires that are contained in the MSW received or received as exclusive loads of tires are
dumped into the solid waste storage pit in the same fashion as other MSW received. In

Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   4-1                    Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
the event of multiple tires in a specific load, the tipping floor loader operator is to com-
municate with the crane operator to ensure there is a plan to bring tires to the top of the
receiving pile and mix them across the pile so as not to collect large stockpiles of tires in
the solid waste storage pit. Tires are then mixed in with the waste being fed to the com-
bustors in the course of normal operations.


Ash is taken to properly permitted landfills. The permits associated with these landfills
are to be modified by the landfill operators if required to allow the acceptance of the ash.
Appendix B includes a list of these permitted facilities.


Water from housekeeping and maintenance activities is collected in a building sump and
pumped back to the solid waste storage pit.


4.2        EMERGENCY OPERATIONS
Normally FCCRWTE has sufficient processing capacity to avoid extended storage of
waste on the tipping floor. However, emergency events may occur that severely limit
FCCRWTE's ability to process waste. Examples of this situation include:
                        Extended facilitywide power failure.
                        Early shutdown of a boiler prior to a cold iron event (i.e., a planned shut-
                        down of both boilers).
                        Extended shutdown of a boiler during a cold iron event.


Under these circumstances, the following steps are taken, as appropriate for the specific
situation, to ensure compliance with the short-term refuse storage limitations established
by FCCRWTE's refuse disposal permit:
                        An assessment is made of FCCRWTE's capacity to process and store MSW
                        within the limits established by its refuse disposal permit. Factors included
                        in this assessment include:
                        o          Current pit level.
                        o          Expected waste deliveries.

                        A determination is made if FCCRWTE can continue to operate within any
                        short-term storage limits without regulatory relief or implementing emer-
                        gency measures.
                        If it is determined that regulatory relief or emergency measures are neces-
                        sary, actions will be taken as follows:
                        o          A request is made to MDE in writing for an extension of the short-
                                   term storage limit.
                        o          If an extension is not granted, waste is then diverted using the follow-
                                   ing priority system:
                                             First: third-party deliveries.
                                             Second: municipalities.
                        The amount of waste diverted is to be based on the specific parameters of
                        the emergency (e.g., duration, if known).
                        Emergency measures are to remain in place until such time that FCCRWTE
                        can operate in compliance with the short-term storage limit.
                        Immediate steps are to be taken to abate the emergency conditions.


Short-term emergency diversion of solid waste is to be to other MSW disposal facilities,
as necessary. This includes other facilities under contract to or operated by the NEA,
Waste Management, or others.

                     5.0 SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS


WTI has a corporate compliance program for safety and health, which each of its facili-
ties is required to implement to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal regu-
lations. These safety and health programs are customized based on the state in which the
facility operates. The corporate safety and health compliance programs are spelled out in
WTI's Corporate Health and Safety Plan, which includes sections on personal protective
equipment, hearing conservation, and respiratory projection (Appendix C).


FCCRWTE has implemented site-specific safety, emergency action and fire prevention,
and other emergency preparedness plans consistent with applicable federal and state
regulations. Since WTI already owns and operates a waste-to-energy facility in the state
of Maryland, the emergency action and fire prevention plan for FCCRWTE is expected to
be similar to the one for the existing WTI Baltimore facility. Requirements of local coun-
ty codes and ordinances will be incorporated into the plan.


The emergency preparedness plan for FCCRWTE addresses certain emergencies and
minimizes their impact on employees, the Facility, and Frederick County. The plan ad-
dresses various crises that may occur and the appropriate response to be taken. Emergen-
cy actions and mobilization procedures, chain of command for corrective action, outside
agency contact for assistance, and rapid response and deployment of needed resources
will all be addressed in the plan. The emergency preparedness plan contains the follow-
ing:
                        Scope of plan.
                        Basic policy.
                        Declaration of critical event and call list.
                        Response actions.
                        Handling of inquiries.
                        Personnel responsibilities.
                        General procedures.
                        Specific emergency procedures.

                        Fire, evacuation, and emergency telephone list.
                        Hurricane, flood, lightning, tornado, and other natural disasters.

                        Medical emergencies.
                        Demonstrations.


The emergency preparedness plan, coupled with the fire control and emergency evacua-
tion plan, will specify the roles and responsibilities for emergency situations and contin-
gencies. Employee preparedness is the key to successfully responding to emergency situ-
ations. Therefore, drills on the emergency situations will be practiced at least annually by
each FCCRWTE shift. Emergency drills will be scheduled. Records will be maintained
by the EH&S manager at FCCRWTE as required.

 OPERATIONS AND
MAINTENANCE PLAN

         APPENDIX A

FACILITY REPORTING STRUCTURE
                                                     APPENDIX A
                                           FACILITY REPORTING STRUCTURE


The operations manager and maintenance manager will report to the plant manager, who
is responsible for the overall operation and maintenance of the facility. In the absence of
the plant manager, the operations manager assumes plant manager duties. Health, safety,
and environmental issues are the responsibility of the health, safety manager and the en-
vironmental compliance manager, who will report to the group environmental health and
safety director and will be responsible for regular interaction with the plant manager and
operations team. the plant controller also reports to the plant manager.


MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION STAFFING
The plant manager will have overall responsibility for facility management and opera-
tions, regulatory compliance, contract obligations, health and safety, budgeting, capital
planning, personnel management, company reporting, customer and community relations,
long-range planning, and emergency response. The plant manager reports directly to
Wheelabrator's Regional Vice President.


The operations manager oversees team leaders to ensure reliable day-to-day operation in
a safe working environment: training, OSHA compliance, consistent facility perfor-
mance, and equipment operating requirements. Continuing education and training and
demonstration of technical competence will be part of the operations manager's job du-
ties.


The maintenance manager directs preventive maintenance protocols, equipment repairs,
and the computerized maintenance management system. Using the computerized mainte-
nance management system, the maintenance manager can monitor work orders, manage
mechanics and electrical and instrumentation personnel, perform contractor oversight
during outages, and perform QA/QC for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance.




Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   A-1             Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
The plant controller provides accounting, invoicing, and financial records oversight and
is responsible for assisting the plant manager with duties that include preparing and main-
taining all facility financial statements and coordinating the facility accounting functions.


The plant accounting and administrative support persons provide accounting and admin-
istrative support duties, which include general accounting support, accounts reconcilia-
tion, benefits administration, and office management along with other administrative
support functions such as completing reporting duties to NEA.


OPERATIONS STAFFING
Rotating shifts will be used to allow for continuous operations of the facility. The use of
rotating shifts has proven to be successful in allowing the employees to become familiar
with conditions on all shifts.


Shift operations for the plant will consist of six shifts. Each shift will be comprised of one
team leader, one plant operator, and two field operators. The six-shift rotation allows for
flexibility in scheduling where the fifth shift is used for relief coverage, preventive
maintenance and training.


Reporting to the operations manager, each team leader will be responsible for the safe,
continuous, proper operation of the plant. The team leader responds to situations ranging
from standard operating procedures to emergency response. They provide technical train-
ing, guidance, and direction to operations personnel; initiate work order requests to the
maintenance groups; perform emergency troubleshooting and repair of plant equipment;
and act as liaison between management and plant operations personnel.


Working under the direction of each team leader will be a plant operator. It will be the
plant operator's responsibility to operate the entire facility from the main control room
and direct the other operators in their daily tasks and in emergency situations. The plant
operator will have the qualifications to substitute for the team leader in the event of ill-
ness or other circumstances.



Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   A-2         Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
Each shift will have two field operators (FO). The FOs' responsibilities will include close
observation and operation of the boilers and auxiliaries, turbine generator, and auxiliaries.
FOs will also be responsible for operation of air pollution control equipment, ash han-
dling and dust control equipment, as well as crane operation. The purpose of having two
FOs is to allow for flexibility and maximize development potential of the operators. As
experience is gained in the field, the FOs will also be trained as relief control room opera-
tors.


In addition to the shift operators, there will be additional day staff to support the shift in
routine repairs, preventive maintenance, and continuous operations. These teams will
have full complements to handle relief coverage, ash house load-out, and weighbridge
operations duties to ensure only authorized vehicles are permitted across the weighbridge.
They are fully involved in the day-to-day operations as well as outage support. During
the busiest time of the refuse receiving hours, the FOs will be assigned to the second
crane to maintain a clear dumping area in the pit accommodating incoming truck traffic.


The loader operators maintain a clear tipping floor area, moving trash for identifying and
segregating nonprocessible waste for subsequent disposal. The loader operator also di-
rects the refuse trucks as to where to dump their loads and screens out unacceptable waste
from the waste stream.


MAINTENANCE STAFFING
The maintenance staff, working under the direction of the maintenance manager, consists
of electrical and instrumentation (E&I) technicians and mechanics. These groups are co-
ordinated to conduct the day-to-day routine and emergency maintenance work required to
operate the facility continuously.


The maintenance team performs most equipment repair, preventive maintenance, and
outage work, such as turbine/generator overhaul and major equipment replacement, and
will direct supplemental maintenance contractor and specialty contractor assistance.




Printed on FSC 100-percent postconsumer recycled paper.   A-3         Y:\GDP-12\WHEEL\O&M.DOCX--061912
The E&I group reports to the maintenance manager. E&I technicians perform routine and
emergency repairs, as well as preventive maintenance, on electrical equipment and in-
strumentation.


There are mechanics that will work day shift in conjunction with the shift personnel and
report to the maintenance manager. Mechanics perform routine and emergency repairs as
well as preventive maintenance on all mechanical and piping systems.


The operational staffing structure described herein provides for holiday, vacation, and
sick time coverage of operating staff personnel. Maintenance policies ensure that person-
nel are identified and scheduled to be on-call in the case of plant emergencies or off-
hours maintenance requirements.


EMERGENCY CONTACTS
Emergency contact names of facility management and telephone numbers will be deter-
mined when the plant is constructed and these positions are filled. A table of emergency
contact information will be prepared and made available prior to the plant start-up.


At this time, FCCRWTE's emergency contact information is:

            5.1       INTRODUCTION
                      While this procedure describes respirator usage in detail, as a general principle
                      respirators are to be used only:
                          · When engineering control of respiratory hazards or work practices are not
                              feasible to reduce exposures;
                          · While engineering controls are being installed; or
                          · In emergencies.

            5.2       EXPOSURE ASSESSMENTS

                      5.2.1      To ensure proper respirator selection, exposure assessments will be
                                 conducted for each employee or representative employee job classification,
                                 initially before first exposure and periodically thereafter, to identify tasks
                                 and areas with potential respiratory exposures and associated exposure
                                 levels, particularly those with exposures above the PEL.

                      5.5.1      Cartridges shall be chosen that are specifically rated for all anticipated
                                 substances that have an assigned PEL (i.e., a PEL of 50 ug/m3 or higher).
                                 In cases where protection from multiple contaminants is necessary, be sure
                                 the cartridge or filter is rated for each contaminant and can handle the
                                 maximum anticipated concentration of each substance.
                      5.5.2      Ensure that all filters, cartridges and canisters used in the workplace are
                                 labeled and color-coded with the NIOSH approval label and that the label
                                 is not removed and remains legible.

            5.6       FIT TESTING
                      Fit testing is performed to ensure respiratory protection fits properly and provides
                      effective protection. Quantitative fit testing is required annually unless authorized
                      by OHS Management. Fit testing records are maintained in the Corp Med Db and
                      are entered by the facility for each respirator assigned to the cmployee.
                      5.6.1      The test shall not be conducted if there is any hair growth between the skin
                                 and the face piece scaling surface, such as stubblc beard growth, beard,
                                 mustache or sideburns which cross the respirator sealing surface. Any type
                                 of apparel which interferes with a satisfactory fit shall be altered or
                                 removed.                   - Facial Hair Guidance.
                      5.6.2      Employees shall be fit tested with the same make, model, style, and size of
                                 respirator that will be worn. Fit testing shall be conducted at the followiug
                                 frequencies:
                                          ·   Before employees are required to use any respirator with a negative
                                              or positive pressure tight-fitting face piece.
                                          ·   Whenever a different respirator face piece (size, style, model, or
                                              make) is used.
                                          ·   Whenever the employee reports, or when a physician, other
                                              licensed health care professional, or site management makes visual
                                              observations of changes in the employee's physical condition that
                                              could affect respirator fit. Such conditions include, but are not
                                              limited to, facial scarring, dental changes, cosmetic surgery, or an
                                              obvious ehange in body weight.
                                          ·   When the employee, subsequently after passing a QLFT or QNFT,
                                              reports that the fit of the respirator is unacceptable. That employee
                                              shall be re-tested with a different respirator face piece.
                                          ·   At least annually.

APPENDIX. C"';ASSIGNED PROTECTION FACTORS
NOTE: For ease of reference, this appendix replicates 111'Pengix A 10 CFR 1910,134

Assigned Protection Factors (APFs). Use the assigned protection factors listed in Table I to
select a respirator that meets or exceeds the required level of employee protection. When using a
combination respirator (e.g., airline respirators with an air-purifying filter), employers must
ensure that the assigned protection factor is appropriate to the mode of operation in which the
respirator is being used.

Notes:
1. Employers may select respirators assigned for use in higher workplace concentrations of a
hazardous substance for use at lower concentrations of that substance, or when required
respirator use is independent of concentration.
2. The assigned protection factors in Table I are only effective when the employer implements a
continuing, effective respirator program as required by this section (29 CFR 1910.134), including
training, fit testing, maintenance, and use requirements.
3. This APF category includes filtering face pieces, and half masks with elastomeric face pieces.
4. The employer must have evidence provided by the respirator manufacturer that testing of these
respirators demonstrates performance at a level of protection of 1,000 or greater to receive an
APF of 1,000. This level of performance can best be demonstrated by performing a WPF or
SWPF study or equivalent testing. Absent such testing, all other PAPRs and SARs with
helmetslhoods are to be treated as loose-fitting face piece respirators, and receive an APF of25.
5. These APFs do not apply to respirators used solely for escape. For escape respirators used in
association with specific substances covered by ~2J;·FR...!21Q suQrutILl., employers must refer to
the appropriate substance-specific standards in that subpart. Escape respirators for other IDLH
atmospheres are specified by ~9 CFR 1910.134 ((!}(]}[ill.

  APPENDIX [j..,.. END QFSERVICE UFEAND CARTRIDGE CHANGE SCHEDULE
  Cartridge Change Out Policy
  Cartridges for gases and vapors with manufacturer-provided End of Service Life Indicators (ESLls) may
  be used until it is indicated that the cartridge has expired and needs to be replaced. Where cartridges do
  not have ESLls, cartridges may only be used a single time ~ after use, cartridges shall be discarded.

  Employees must also replace cartridges if they experience odor, taste or a sense of irritation when
  wearing an air-purifying respirator. Additionally, particulate and mist cartridges must be changed if the
  breathing resistance increases significantly.

  Cartridge End of Service Life Estimation
  As noted above, some cartridges used for gases and vapors (such as ammonia and hydrochloric
  acid/hydrogen chloride) may not have End Of Service Life indicators. However, based on expected
  exposure levels and known work activities, the above Change Out Policy can serve as an alternate
  method to ensure employee protection when using those organic vapor cartridges.

  As an extra measure) cartridge life can also be estimated using cartridge manufacturer computer
  programs (if available) to estimate service life of each type of cartridge used when exposure is equal to
  IDLH concentrations. This is a very protective approach, since air-purifying respirators are not allowed
  to be worn in IDLH atmospheres. However, even at an IDLH concentration, employee tasks generally do
  not 1ast longer tIJan t h       I

APPENDIXE- USERSEALCHECK PROCEDURES
User Seal Check Procedurcs. The individual who uses a tight-fitting respirator is to perform a
user seal check to ensure that an adequate seal is achieved each time the respirator is put on.
Either the positive and negative pressure checks listed in this appendix. or the respirator
manufacturers recommended user seal check method shall be used. User seal checks are not
substitutes for qualitative or quantitative fit tests.

I.   Face piece Positive and/or Negative Pressure Checks

     A. Positive pressure check. Close off the exhalation valve and exhale gently into the face
     piece. The face fit is considered satisfactory if a slight positive pressure can be built up inside
     the face piece without any evidence of outward leakage of air at the seaL For most respirators
     this mcthod of leak testing requires the wearer to first remove the exhalation valve cover
     before closing off the exhalation valve and then carefully replacing it after the tcst

     B. Negative pressure check. Close ofI the inlet opening of the canister or cartridge(s) by
     covering with the palm of the hand(s) or by replacing the filter seal(s). inhale gently so that
     the face piece collapses slightly, and hold the breath for ten seconds. The design of the inlet
     opcning of some cartridges cannot be effectively covered with the palm of the hand. The test
     can be performed by covering the inlet opening of the cartridge with a thin latex or nitrile
     glove. If the face piece remains in its slightly collapsed condition and no inward leakage of
     air is detected, the tightness of the respirator is considered satisfactory.

II. Manufacturer's Recommended User Seal Check Procedures

     The respirator manufacturer's recommended procedures lor performing a user seal check may
     be used instead of the positive and/or negative pressure check procedures provided that the
     employer demonstrates that the manufacturer's procedures are equally effective.

                                 annual audiogram in accordance with the Medical Surveillance Program.
                                 It is the responsibility of each facility to schedule the annual audiograms.
                                 The audiograms shall be provided at no cost to the employee. An
                                 audiologist will review and interpret all baseline and annual audiograms.

            5.8       EVALUATION OF AUDIOGRAMS AND OSHA STS RECORDABILITY

                      5.8.1      An OSHA Significant Threshold Shift (STS) occurs when the employee
                                 has experienced an STS in one or both ears AND the employee has an
                                 average hearing level of 25 decibels (dB) at the frequency level of 2000,
                                 3000, and 4000 Hertz (Hz).
                      5.8.2      An employee who sustains a significant threshold shift as defined by
                                 OSHA will be referred to the contract medical provider or an audiologist
                                 for a repeat audiogram within 30 days to confirm or deny the STS. For
                                 further processing detail, see section 5.8.4.
                      5.8.3      If the repeat hearing tcst confirms an OSHA STS, then the employee will
                                 be referred to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation to
                                 determine if the shift in hearing is considered work related. The OSHA
                                 significant threshold shift will be recorded manually into AIMS as an
                                 OSHA Recordable []]ness when it is the audiologist's opinion that the
                                 change in hearing conld possibly be related to noise exposure at work.
                      5.S.4      All audiograms shall be processed in the following manner:
                                          ·   An audiologist reviews audiograms.
                                          ·   Employees with an OSHA STS are referred for a repeat audiogram
                                              within 30 days of the initial audiogram. If the employee fails to
                                              complete a repeat hearing test within the 30-day period, the STS
                                              must be manually entered into AIMS.
                                          ·   If the retest does not confim1 an OSHA STS, then no further action
                                              is required. If the retest confirms an OSHA STS.
                                          ·   A confirmed OSHA STS must be manually entered into AIMS as a
                                              "Non-OSHA Recordable, Noise Induced Hearing Loss Illness".
                                              Note: "OSHA Recordable" is not selected in AIMS until an
                                              audiologist determines that the hearing loss is related to work.
                                          ·   The Wheelabrator Medical Department refers the employee to a
                                              local audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation as
                                              required by OSHA.

AUDIOMETRIC TESTS

     ·      The purpose of audiometric testing is to identify the progression of occupational hearing
            loss so that steps ean be taken to stop it The best approach is to identify a temporary
            hearing loss before it becomes permanent,
     ·      Baseline audio grams will be performed within 6 months of employment.
     ·      Annual audiograms will be performed when an employee is exposed to noise exceeding:
                o 8-hr TWA at nr above 85dBA OR
                o 12-hr TWA at or above 83dBA
     ·      Annual audiograms will be compared to the employee's baseline audiogram. Ifthe annual
            audiogram shows a standard threshold shift, a retest will be performed within 30 days,
            The Audiologist will review the audiogram and determine whether there is a need lor
            further evaluation. If the comparison of the tests confirms a standard threshold shift, the
            employee shall be infonned in writing within 2 I days of the determination.

To prevent hearing loss, it is critical that hearing protection is worn when exposed to high
noise levels - on and off the job. Don't forget to wear hearing protection at home when:
    · Working with power tools or other lond equipment
    · Mowing the lawn or using weed trimmers, chain saws, etc.
   · Using ATV's, dirt bikes, when at race tracks, while on motor boats
   · Practicing with your band
    · Participating in shooting sports

APPENDIX B,.. NOISE REDUCTION RATING,ATTENUATION, AND DE-RATING

NOISE REDUCTION RATING (NRR)
Manufacturers of hearing protection assign a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) to each type of
hearing protector. The NRR is an indication of the relative level of protection providcd by the
plug or muff. The higher the NRR, the more protection the equipment provides. The NRR is
determiued under ideal laboratory conditions and should not be nsed as a direct measurement of
the protection that each wearer will receive.

ATTENUA nON

Attenuation indicates the amount of noise reduction obtained by wearing a protector. In other
words, attenuation means the amount of sound that will be absorbed or repelled by the protective
device being worn. Judging the relative amount of noise reduction or attenuation provided by
insert and semi-insert hearing protection devices can be achieved by inserting the devices and
listening to the volume level of your own voice. Generally, the amount of attennation provided
by different types of insert or semi-insert devices which occlnde (seal) the opening to the car
canals can be uniquely judged by each wearer.

The tcchnique is simple: insert the device and listen to the volume or loudness level of your
voice. Since this vocal signal represents the lower range of frequencies, 2000 Hz and below
primarily, the relative loudness can be easily judged even among those who have a rather
significant amount of hearing loss. The softer the level of your voice, the greater the amount of
hearing protection being delivered by the device being tested.

This simple technique allows each uscr to judgc the relative performance of diffcrent devices as
well as when using different hearing protection device insertion methods andior wearing
techniques. This offers important clues: you can compare the relative effectiveness for different
devices, different methods of use or insertion (deep vs. shallow insertion of a plug, for example)
and differenccs betwecn right and left car fittings. These comparisons should be pcrforn1ed in
relatively quiet surroundings.

DE-RATING

Hearing conservation professionals have used special equipment in the field to mimic the
procedures for cvaluating hearing protector attenuation in the laboratOlY. A series of studies
using a variety of hearing protectors has shown that the average attenuation that people receive in
the workplace is only about one-third to one-half the attenuation that laboratory subjects receive.
In addition, the variability among wearers, as shown by the standard deviation, is two to three
times greater than in the laboratory. It appears that the differences between field and laboratory
results are greater for plugs than for mutTs, although the foam plugs appear to perform somewhat
better than most of the other plug varieties.

One of the consequences of this disparity between the NRR and actual field attenuation is
reflected in a 1983 enforcement memo issued by OSHA's Office of Health Compliance
Assistance. Based on OSHA's enforcement guidelines, the memo instructs federal OSHA
inspectors to de-rate the hearing protector's NRR by 50 percent (divide the NRR in half).

DE-RATING CALCULATIONS

Use the following calculations to estimate the attenuation afforded to a noise-exposcd employee
in an actual work environment by plugs, muffs or a combination of both.

 USE OF SINGLE HEARING PROTECTION - PLUGS OR MUFFS

 Estimated Actual Noise Level (dBAI" (Noise exposure in dBAI                                [(0.5) x (NRR-7dbl 1


I. Subtract 7dB from the NRR to correct for using A-weighted sound level metcr
   measurements.

2. To adjust for workplace conditions, apply a safety factor of 50%.

            Example: A sound level meter measurement was recordcd at 94dBA. The facility had
            purchased insert hearing protection having a NRR of 31. What would be the employee's
            exposure while working in this area')
                                 =   94dBA         [0.5 X (31         7)]
                                 = 94dBA - [0.5 X 24]
                                 =   94dBA-12

            Answer: 82dBA is the employee's noise exposure wearing this hearing protection.

 USE OF DOUBLE HEARING PROTECTION - PLUGS AND MUFFS

 Estimated Actual Noise Level (dBA) = (Noise exposure in dBA) - [(0.5) x (NRR-7db) + 5]

I. Subtract 7dB from the NRR to correct for using A-weighted measurements.

2. To adjust for workplace conditions, apply a safety factor of 50%.

3. Add 5dB to the field-adjusted NRR to account for the use of the second hearing protector.

            Example: A sound level meter measurement was recorded at 98dBA. This area requires
            double hearing protection (greater than 95dBA). The facility had purchased insert hearing
            protection having a NRR of 31. What would be the employee's exposure while working
            in this area wearing double hearing protection?
                                 = 98dBA          [0.5 X (31 - 7) + 5]
                                 =   98dBA - [0.5 X 24 + 5]
                                 = 98dBA - 12 + 5
            Answer: SldBA is the employee's noise exposure wearing double hearing protection

            Note: When using Double Hearing Protection, an increase in attenuation of 5 is used
            based on scientific studies. However, certain brands and types of ear muffs may afford
            attenuation greater than 5 when combined with insert protection (ear plugs).

            5.9       SHARP OBJECTS PROTECTION
                      The purpose of sharp objects protection policy is to identify potential sources of
                      sharps and sharp materials in the waste stream or processing equipment that may
                      cause injury to personnel if they were to come into contact. This section describes
                      inspection precautions, protective barriers, cleaning and handling techniques to
                      avoid injury from sharp objects. See              for additional information.
                      Millions of Americans use needles (Sharps) to regularly inject prescription
                      medications. Over three billion syringes are discarded into the public solid waste
                      stream every year:
                          · In coffee cans
                          · In plastic bottles

                                PPE is the last line of defense for potential exposures. Engineering
                                controls and administrative controls should bc implemented first where
                                feasible. When PPE is uscd it must be sclected based on the type of actual
                                or potential hazard and accommodate the type of work the employee will
                                be performing. For instance, puncture resistant gloves do not need to be
                                issucd to every employec. Use the correct PPE for the job at hand.
                                Cut/punctnre resistant clothing may not be necessary for every job
                                Examples of PPE that may be selected based on the actual or potential

                     5.9.6      Bloodbomc Pathogens (BBP)
                                Use universal precautions when handling sharp objects. Universal
                                Precautions is an OSHA-mandated system of infection-control methods.
                                Under this system, the only sensible way to protect employees from blood
                                borne pathogens is by treating all body fluids (OSHA-defined) as
                                potentially infectious. Therefore, everyone needs to protect all points of
                                entry into the body that could be exposed to body fluids while pcrforming
                                job tasks. Points of entry into the body are the mucous membranes of the
                                eyes, nose, and mouth and the skin. For further information refer to
                                WOHS-19lJLLP30 Bloodbomc Pathogens Exposure_Control.

 Notes:
    l. A High Temperature Task is defined as any identified work being conducted that exposes
                  employees to ambient or surface temperatures 2: 120 degrees F.
       2.         In accordance with OSHA, any hazards should be dealt with utilizing the hierarchy of
                  controls, first using feasible engineering, secondly work practices, and then finally PPE
                  for protection.
       3.         The tasks listed are not all-inclusive and address commonly perfonned jobs - add addi-
                  tional site-specific tasks as necessary. Similarly, the specified apparel & PPE identified in
                  the tables are minimum requirements for the task. More protective apparel and equipment
                  may be required based on actual conditions. Always consult task-specific JHA's, WTI
                  supervision, or the Hampton Safety Department if there are any questions concerning the
                  correct protective apparel or PPE for any task.
      4.          Where heat stress or fogging of goggles or respirators are a conccm, evaluate the use of a
                  work/rest regimen, area or personal cooling equipment
       5.         If a task requires the Buddy system, the "Buddy" will need to be at the same level of PPE
                  as the person perfonning the high temperature task unless posted beyond the area of ex-
                  posure (outside the pre-detennined danger zone).

     6. Respiratory protection may be needed for tasks based on potential atmospheric hazards.
         Evaluate potential respiratory hazards and the need for respiratory protection on a case-
         by-case basis.
     7. "View ports" and "covers" are considered to be openings less than 12" in its least dimen-
         sion. Openings 12 inches or greater in its least dimension are considered to be doorways.
     8. Categories I and 3 are based on upper body exposures, while Categories 2 and 4 are
         based on whole body exposures. If actual site conditions for Categories I and 3 tasks re-
         sult in different or additional exposures, protective apparel and PPE willnced to be simi-
         larly upgraded.
     9. Category 0 and 0+ tasks requiring Company-provided cotton unifonn (sleeves rolled
         down) are based on momentary contact exposures up to 300 degrees F. Category I and 2
         tasks requiring NOMEX or equivalent protective apparel are based on momentary contact
         exposures up to 700 deg. F (DuPont reference). Category 3 and 4 tasks requiring alumi-
         nized apparel are based on momentary contact exposures up to 2000 deg. F.
     10. Category I and 2 tasks requiring NOMEX or equivalent protective apparel are based on
         momentary contact exposures up to 700 deg. F (DuPont reference). Category 3 and 4
         tasks requiring aluminized apparel are based on momentary contact exposures up to 2000
         deg. F.
     II. Protective apparel and PPE for Category 3 or 4 on-line or off-line boiler activity tasks
         may be downf,'faded to Category I or 2 tasks (as applicable) if exposure temperatures are
         proven to be reduced to 700 deg. F. or less (such as when boilers and/or ash are cooled).
     12. Protective apparel selection for tasks with high prcssureltemperature steam or t1uids ex-
         posures must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as tempera-
         ture, pressure, location, and duratiOn/frequency of exposure.
     13. Hard hats are required to be worn under aluminized hoods, unless otherwise instmcted by
         plant supervision.

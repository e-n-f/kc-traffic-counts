INTRODUCTION


Initial Study

Pursuant to Section 15063 of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines (Title 14,
California Code of Regulations, Sections 15000 et seq.), an Initial Study is a preliminary environmental
analysis that is used by the lead agency as a basis for determining whether an Environmental Impact
Report (EIR), a Mitigated Negative Declaration, or a Negative Declaration is required for a project. The
State CEQA Guidelines require that an Initial Study contain a project description, description of
environmental setting, identification of environmental effects by checklist or other similar form,
explanation of environmental effects, discussion of mitigation for significant environmental effects,
evaluation of the project's consistency with existing, applicable land use controls, and the names of
persons who prepared the study.

The purpose of this Initial Study is to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed
Evergreen Valley College (EVC) 2025 Facilities Master Plan (FMP) and to determine what level of
additional environmental review, if any, is appropriate. As shown in the Determination in Section IV of
this document and based on the analysis contained in this Initial Study, the San José/Evergreen
Community College District has determined that the proposed EVC 2025 FMP could result in potentially
significant impacts; therefore, preparation of an EIR is appropriate.

Anticipated Project Approvals

The San José/Evergreen Community College District (SJECCD) will prepare an EIR that fully evaluates
the environmental effects associated with the implementation of the proposed 2025 FMP. Necessary
project approvals are anticipated to include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following by the
SJECCD Board of Trustees (anticipated in spring/summer 2012):

      Certification of the EVC 2025 FMP EIR and

      Approval of the proposed EVC 2025 FMP.


Public and Agency Review

The Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the EIR and this Initial Study will be circulated for public and
agency review from July 10, 2012 through August 9, 2012. Copies of the Initial Study are available during
normal operating hours at the District office at the address below and online at sjeccd.edu. Comments on
the NOP/Initial Study must be received by 5:00 PM on August 9, 2012. They may be e-mailed to
douglas.smith@sjeccd.edu.or sent to:

II.         PROJECT LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION

1.      Description of the Project:

        Location: The EVC campus is located at 3095 Yerba Buena Road in east-central San José in Santa
        Clara County. The location of the campus within Santa Clara County and the City of San José is
        shown in Figure 1, Regional and Site Location. The campus is near the eastern City boundary and
        is bounded by San Felipe Road to the west, Yerba Buena Road to the south, Montgomery Hill Park
        to the east, and Falls Creek Drive to the north. The campus encompasses about 165.5 acres. The
        northern portion of campus consists of a hillside area while the southern portion of the campus is
        flat and is referred to as the "plains."

        Project Need: The 2025 FMP translates the program space needs established in the EVC 2025
        Educational Master Plan into physical facilities on the campus. According to the 2025 Educational
        Master Plan for the EVC campus, total enrollment on campus is expected to reach approximately
        14,850 students by 2025, which equates to 9,100 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) students (FTES). Based
        on these projections, future program needs on the campus total approximately 355,175 square feet
        of space, calculated based on allowable standards referenced in the California Code of Regulations
        Title 5. The amount of space required on the campus takes into account of all facility needs of the
        campus ­ academic space as well as space for support services. The 2025 Education Master Plan
        determined that EVC does not show any significant need for additional space through the year
        2025, although there are needs in certain specific space categories.

        Project Characteristics: The 2025 FMP involves reorganization of campus facilities and
        reconfiguration of campus access and circulation. The proposed 2025 FMP for the EVC campus is
        depicted in Figure 2, Evergreen Valley College 2025 Facilities Master Plan. The recommendations
        contained in the 2025 FMP address the current and projected needs of the campus through 2025.

        Facility recommendations contained in the 2025 FMP include (1) the demolition/removal of
        existing building on campus; (2) the construction of new buildings on campus; and (3) the
        renovation of existing buildings on campus to meet the future programs needs as outlined in 2025
        Educational Master Plan. A description of each of these elements is provided below.

        Recommended Demolition/Removal
        The 2025 FMP identifies several buildings for demolition/removal to eliminate non-functioning
        space and replace the oldest and most aged facilities with new facilities. Facilities identified by the
        2025 FMP for demolition/removal include Cluster Acacia, Cluster Roble, Racquetball Courts, and
        all portable buildings. The location of each of these facilities is shown in Figure 3, Recommended
        Demolition/Removal Plan.

        New Construction Projects
        Descriptions of new construction projects planned on the EVC campus are organized into groups
        based on campus location. The order of the projects does not reflect priority order or a
        recommended sequence of development. Preliminary phasing plans will be developed following
        the completion of the 2025 FMP and will be tied to availability of funding.

        Math/Science Complex ­ The new Math/Science Complex would be part of a South Campus
        Development project and would provide new instructional space and be coordinated with the
        removal of the aging Cluster Acacia. The multi-story complex would include dedicated labs and
        flexible classroom to support the science and math programs. The proposed location, to the south
        of the Gullo Student Center building (Gullo I) in the center of the campus, ties into the lower level
        of the Student Center and would bring activity to an underutilized area of the campus. The new
        outdoor gathering space would be framed by buildings to create connections to the "plains" area
        of the campus.

        Automotive Technology ­ The Automotive Technology Building would replace aging facilities
        that are currently part of Cluster Acacia. Its new northwest campus location would also have the
        "Hillside" as a backdrop and be located near the new parking lot with photovoltaic canopies.

        General Education Building ­ The General Education Building would be part of a South Campus
        Development project and would provide replacement classroom space as the aging cluster
        buildings are removed from the campus. The proposed location, adjacent to the Math/Science
        Complex, would help to define the new outdoor areas to the south of Gullo I. This multi-story
        instructional building would include multi-purpose, flexible instructional space to support a
        variety of disciplines.

        GED/Engineering/Language Arts/Social Science ­ This facility would be located in the northwest
        portion of campus on the site vacated by the demolition of cluster Roble. It would anchor the
        Village Walk West, with the "Hillside" as a backdrop, and would help redefine the western edge
        of the campus. This multi-story instructional building would include multi-purpose, flexible,
        instructional space to support general education, engineering, language arts, and social science.

        Fitness Center ­ The proposed 7,000 square-foot Fitness Center would be part of a South Campus
        Development project and is proposed to be located to the south of the Physical Education building,
        adjacent to the athletic fields. The facility is in close proximity to the Fitness Walk and operable
        windows would provide broad views to the grass sports field (the "Plains"). This may be the first
        LEED® project on the campus.

        Renovation Projects
        The 2025 FMP recommends renovations to several buildings. A description of renovation projects
        planned on the EVC campus is provided below. The order of the projects does not reflect priority
        order or a recommended sequence of development. In addition to the projects highlighted below,
        the 2025 FMP recommends the renovation of all other existing campus facilities as required.

        Central Plant/Campus Police Building ­ During the planning process, the Central Plant/Campus
        Police Building was analyzed in order to determine the best course of action for the future. Both
        renovation and replacement facilities were considered, but ultimately the decision was made to
        renovate the existing Central Plant/Campus Police Building in its current location. This decision
        was considered to be the most economical and would save over $8 million compared to the cost of
        new facilities. Mechanical equipment in the Central Plant would be upgraded, electrical service
        equipment would be replaced, and staff areas would be improved. The District's Police
        Department, which operates from the Campus Police Building, would expand to allow more
        efficient operations and provide a secure environment responsive to current District needs. The
        exterior of the building would be improved to reflect a more consistent campus architectural

        theme and to provide a more recognizable presence for Campus Police.

        Administration/Student Services Center ­The 2025 FMP recommends that the
        Administration/Student Services Center be studied in conjunction with the Admission & Records
        (A&R) building with the goal of developing a long-range plan that addresses both current budget
        and staffing reductions, which will potentially affect the configuration and uses of the building,
        and the long-term needs of the College.

        Admissions & Records Building ­ A&R has also been identified as a building requiring
        operational-related renovations. The 2025 FMP recommends that the A&R building be studied in
        conjunction with the Administration/Student Services Center with the goal of developing a long-
        range plan that addresses both current budget and staffing reductions, which will potentially
        affect the configuration and uses of the building, and the long-term needs of the College.

        Gullo I ­ The 2025 FMP recommends that Gullo I, the Student Center, be reconfigured to provide
        additional space for the Student Activities Center. This would consolidate most student activities
        in one location. There is a potential under the FMP to relocate the bookstore; further study of this
        issue would be needed.

        Gullo II ­ Gullo II is primarily used as a multi-functional event and community room. It has a
        capacity to hold 250-300 people; however, acoustically it functions poorly. The 2025 FMP
        recommends that the location of a new large multi-purpose event room be studied and that this
        function vacate Gullo II. The 2025 FMP further recommends that this space be reprogrammed and
        renovated to house a new café and informal student gathering area.

        Site Improvements
        In addition to the recommendations for facilities, a series of site improvement recommendations
        were identified in the 2025 FMP, consisting of a recommended vehicular circulation plan, a
        recommended pedestrian circulation plan, and recommended landscape improvements. These are
        show in Figure 4, Recommended Vehicular Circulation Plan; Figure 5, Recommended
        Pedestrian Circulation Plan; and Figure 6, Recommended Landscape Improvements.


2.      Project objectives:
        The primary objective of the 2025 FMP is to provide the necessary facilities to accommodate the
        planned 2025 student population for the EVC campus.

3.      Surrounding land uses and environmental setting:

        The campus is in a suburban setting that has experienced substantial commercial and residential
        development in the past several years. Nearby uses include residential uses to the north beyond
        Evergreen Creek, to the west beyond Thompson Creek, and to the south beyond Yerba Buena
        Creek; Falls Creek Park to the north; Evergreen Park and a church to the south; Montgomery Hill
        Park and undeveloped lands to the east; and an assisted-living facility to the west. Figure 7,
        Surrounding Land Uses, depicts the location of these land uses in relation to the EVC campus.

IV.         DETERMINATION:

On the basis of the initial evaluation that follows:

           I find that the proposed project WOULD NOT have a significant effect on the environment, and a
   
           NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

           I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, there
           will not be a significant effect in this case because revisions in the project have been made that will
   
           avoid or reduce any potential significant effects to a less than significant level. A MITIGATED
           NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

           I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment. An
           ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT will be prepared.

V.          EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

During the completion of the environmental evaluation, the SJECCD relied on the following categories of
impacts, noted as column headings in the IS checklist.

A)         "Potentially Significant Impact" is appropriate if there is substantial evidence that the project's
           effect may be significant. If there are one or more "Potentially Significant Impacts" for which
           effective mitigation may not be possible, an EIR will be prepared.

B)         "Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated" applies where the incorporation of
           project-specific mitigation would reduce an effect from "Potentially Significant Impact" to a "Less
           Than Significant Impact."

C)         "Less Than Significant Impact" applies where the project would not result in a significant effect
           (i.e., the project impact would be less than significant without the need to incorporate mitigation).

D)         "No Impact" applies where the project would not result in any impact in the category or the
           category does not apply. This may be because the impact category does not apply to the proposed
           project (for instance, the project site is not within a surface fault rupture hazard zone), or because
           of other project-specific factors.

 1. AESTHETICS ­ Would the project:

 a) Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista?                                                             
 b) Substantially damage scenic resources, including, but
 not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic                                                              
 buildings within a state scenic highway?

 c) Substantially degrade the existing visual character or                                                           
 quality of the site and its surroundings?

 d) Create a new source of substantial light or glare
 which would adversely affect day or nighttime views in                                                              
 the area?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus. The
campus is located in a hilly region, but the topography of the campus is relatively flat and the campus is
mostly developed. Based on a review of the San José 2020 General Plan, there are no scenic vistas that
include the campus as a major part of the view (San José 1994).

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) A scenic vista is generally defined as an expansive view of highly valued landscape as observable from
a publicly accessible vantage point. Although there are views across the campus to the San Felipe Hills,
and views from within the campus that are of high visual quality, the existing development on the
campus itself does not interfere with visual resources. There are no scenic vistas that include the campus
as a major part of the view. The campus is screened from the view of adjacent residents south of Park
Estates Way by riparian vegetation to the south of the campus. The campus is partially screened from the
view of adjacent residents north of Falls Creek Drive by the existing District Warehouse and riparian
vegetation. Views of the north campus parking lot and portions of campus buildings are available from
areas along Falls Creek Drive; however, these views are not of high visual quality (SJECCD 2000). Distant
views of the campus are available from higher elevations along Yerba Buena Road southwest of the
campus; from these viewpoints, campus development appears against the backdrop of surrounding
residential development and open space.

The proposed new structures would be sited in undeveloped areas of the campus. However, the
proposed facilities would be similar in type and scale to the existing college facilities and would be built
within the existing campus boundaries. Furthermore, as noted above, there are no scenic vistas that
include the campus as a major part of the view. Therefore, there would not be a substantial change to any

0461.004                                                                                                             July 2012
scenic vistas. Based on these factors, the proposed project would have no impact with regard to this
criterion.

b) There are no state-designated scenic highways in the vicinity of the campus (CSHP 2011). Therefore,
changes on the campus as a result of the 2025 FMP implementation would not affect visual resources
associated with any state-designated or local scenic highway. There would be no impact with regard to
this criterion.

c) Facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would be similar in type and scale to existing facilities on the
campus, and new facilities would be constructed entirely within the campus. However, there is still the
potential that implementation of the 2025 FMP could alter the existing visual character and quality of the
campus as viewed from the surrounding neighborhoods. In addition, the construction of facilities
identified in the 2025 FMP could result in the loss of mature trees, which would further alter the existing
visual character of the campus. This represents a potentially significant impact. The effects of the 2025
FMP on the existing visual character or quality of the campus and its surroundings will be analyzed in
the EIR.

d) Existing buildings on the campus are a source of light and glare, and cars on the campus may also be a
source of glare. Other existing sources of light and glare on the campus include sports facilities and
lighting in parking lots and along pathways. New buildings proposed under the 2025 FMP would shift
some light and glare sources within the campus, and could increase light and glare in parts of the
campus. This represents a potentially significant impact. The effects of light and glare associated with the
2025 FMP implementation on the campus and its surroundings will be analyzed in the EIR.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The proposed project combined with other current projects and probable future projects and projected
regional growth could result in significant cumulative impacts with regard to visual character and light
and glare. These issues will be addressed in the EIR.

 2. AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY RESOURCES ­
 Would the project:

 a) Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or
 Farmland of Statewide Importance (Farmland), as
 shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland

 Resources Agency, to non-agricultural use?

 b) Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a                                                               
 Williamson Act contract?

 c) Conflict with existing zoning for, or cause rezoning of,
 forest land (as defined in Public Resources Code section
 12220(g)), timberland (as defined in Public Resources                                                                     
 Code Section 4526), or Timberland zoned Timberland
 Production (as defined by Government Code section
 51104(g))?

 d) Result in the loss of forest land or conversion of forest                                                              
 land to non-forest use?

 e) Involve other changes in the existing environment,
 which, due to their location or nature, could result in                                                                   
 conversion of Farmland, to non-agricultural use or
 conversion of forest land to non-forest use?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus. The
campus is designated as Urban and Built-Up Land and Other Land on maps prepared by the California
State Department of Conservation pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP)
(FMMP 2011).

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) The entire campus is developed and located in a developed area of the City of San José. The campus is
not used for agriculture, and is not designated as Farmland on maps prepared by the California State
Department of Conservation pursuant to the FMMP. There would be no impact with regard to this
criterion.

b-c) Although the campus is not subject to City zoning, the campus is zoned for urban use by the City of
San José. No portion of the campus is zoned for agricultural use, forest land, or timberland. In addition,

there is no Williamson Act contract applicable to the campus. Therefore, future development on the
campus would not conflict with existing zoning for agricultural or forest land or timberland use or with a
Williamson Act contract. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

d) The campus and surrounding area does not include any forest land or timberland. There would be no
impact with regard to this criterion.

e) No Farmland or other agricultural land is present in the vicinity of the campus. Therefore,
implementation of the 2025 FMP would not involve any changes that could indirectly cause conversion of
Farmland to non-agricultural use. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The City of San José is urban in nature, and is not designated as Farmland on maps prepared pursuant to
the FMMP. As a result, anticipated future development in San José, including the future development on
the campus under the 2025 FMP, would not result in the loss of Farmland. In addition, land in the City is
zoned for urban uses. Therefore, anticipated future development in San José would not displace land
zoned for agricultural use or forest land or timberland, and would not conflict with land under a
Williamson Act contact. The impact of cumulative development on agricultural and forest resources
would be less than significant.

 3. AIR QUALITY ­ Where available, the significance
 criteria established by the applicable air quality
 management or air pollution control district may be
 relied upon to make the following determinations.
 Would the project:

 a) Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the                                                                   
 applicable air quality plan?

 b) Violate any air quality standard or contribute
 substantially to an existing or projected air quality                                                                
 violation?

 c) Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of
 any criteria pollutant for which the project region is non-
 attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient                                                              
 air quality standard (including releasing emissions
 which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
 precursors)?

 d) Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant                                                               
 concentrations?

 e) Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial
 number of people?                                                                                                    

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
nearest sensitive receptors to the campus include single-family residential uses to the north, south, and
west. Other sensitive receptors in the vicinity of the campus include Evergreen Park and Church on the
Rock - Baptist to the south; Montgomery Hill Park to the east; and an assisted-living facility to the west.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a-c) The campus is located in the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin, which is currently designated a non-
attainment area for PM10 (particulate matter 10 microns or less in diameter), PM2.5 (particulate matter
2.5 microns or less in diameter), and ozone. Construction and operation of facilities identified in the 2025
FMP would be likely to add incrementally to regional ambient air pollutant emissions including short-
and long-term emissions of criteria air pollutants from mobile and stationary sources. This represents a
potentially significant impact. The EIR will estimate the total emissions from construction and operation
of future buildings identified in the 2025 FMP and evaluate whether the emissions would exceed the Bay

0461.004                                                                                                               July 2012
Area Air Quality Monitoring District (BAAQMD) recommended thresholds for evaluating impacts from
criteria pollutant emissions.

d) Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would result in on-site emissions of diesel
particulate matter, which the California Air Resources Board has identified as a toxic air contaminant. In
addition, operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP could impact nearby sensitive receptors by
creating the potential for localized CO hotspots. This represents a potentially significant impact. The EIR
will evaluate concentrations of CO, toxic air contaminants, and other pollutants associated with the 2025
FMP to determine whether they would result in a significant effect on sensitive receptors.

e) Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would require the use of diesel-fueled equipment
and architectural coatings, both of which have an associated odor. However, these odors would be short-
term and temporary and would not be pervasive enough to affect a substantial number of people or to be
objectionable. Routine operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would not involve activities that
typically produce odors such as wastewater treatment, manufacturing, agriculture, etc. Occasional use of
maintenance products on the campus could produce odors but they would be temporary and limited in
area. Consequently, odors associated with short-term construction and long-term operation of facilities
under the 2025 FMP would not cause or be affected by odors, and the impact would be less than
significant.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The construction and operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP combined with other current
projects and probable future projects and projected regional growth could result in significant cumulative
impacts with regard to air quality. This issue will be addressed in the EIR.

  4. BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES ­ Would the project:

  a) Have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or
  through habitat modifications, on any species identified
  as a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local

  conservation plan?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
campus is located within a suburban setting within the Evergreen Valley. A majority of the campus is
developed, except for undeveloped areas in the northern and southern portions of campus (SJECCD
2000). The undeveloped portions of the campus consist mainly of disturbed grasslands.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) The most recent versions of the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) and California Native
Plant Society (CNPS) databases were reviewed for the vicinity of the campus. According to CNDDB and
CNPS query results, several special-status plant and wildlife species have been documented in the project
area (i.e., within 3 miles of the campus). Undeveloped grasslands may provide habitat for special-status
species and development under the 2025 FMP could disturb these species. This represents a potentially
significant impact. The EIR will analyze potential impacts to special-status plant and wildlife species and
associated habitat potentially occurring on or near the campus.

b) The campus is generally developed, and is not identified in any adopted plan as having sensitive
natural communities. However, there are undeveloped areas in the northern and southern portions of the
campus, and two creeks, Thompson Creek and Yerba Buena Creek, are located near the western and
southern campus boundaries, respectively. In addition, there is an unnamed drainage north of the
campus (SJECCD 2000). As a result, development under the 2025 FMP could impact the riparian habitats
present along these drainages. This represents a potentially significant impact. The EIR will identify and
analyze potential impacts regarding sensitive and/or riparian habitats within or near the campus.

c) Evergreen Lake is located within the southeast portion of the campus, and further analysis is required
to determine if this lake may be considered a federally protected wetland or waters of the United States.
Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP in the vicinity of Evergreen Lake could affect this
feature. Additionally, further analysis is required to determine if wetland habitats occur within the
undeveloped grassland portions of the campus in the areas where new facilities would be built under the
2025 FMP. Therefore, impacts to jurisdictional resources are considered a potentially significant impact.
The EIR will identify and analyze impacts regarding impacts to jurisdictional resources.

d) Undeveloped portions of the campus contain disturbed grassland that provides biological resource
values, including habitat for wildlife. In addition, two creeks, Thompson Creek and Yerba Buena Creek,
are located near the western and southern boundaries of the campus. Therefore, the campus may provide
wildlife movement corridors or nursery sites, and the implementation of the 2025 FMP could have
impacts on such resources). In addition, mature trees on the campus could provide nesting habit to
migratory bird species that are protected under state and federal laws. Construction activity associated
with development under the 2025 FMP could result in the removal of trees on the campus. If removal of
trees occurred during breeding season, this action could result in the disruption of nesting activities. This
represents a potentially significant impact. The EIR will identify and evaluate potential impacts related to
wildlife movement corridors or nesting migratory birds.

e) Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP may require the removal of some trees, regardless
of health, to facilitate development or to mitigate potentially hazardous circumstances related to their
proximity to existing facilities. The City of San José has a tree ordinance that requires a permit for
removal of any trees on private property that have a trunk circumference of 56 inches or more, measured
2 feet above grade. As a state entity, the SJECCD is exempted by the state constitution from compliance
with local land use regulations and ordinances. There would be no impact with respect to this criterion.

f) No adopted habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan applies to the campus.
There would be no impact with respect to this criterion. However, a habitat conservation plan/natural
community conservation plan is currently being prepared for the Santa Clara Valley and the campus is
located within the boundaries of the plan.

 feature?

 d) Disturb any human remains, including those                                                                        
 interred outside of formal cemeteries?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
buildings on the campus date from the 1970s through the 2000s. According to the Northwest Information
Center (NWIC), there is a high potential for identifying unrecorded Native American resources and
historic-period archaeological resources on or near the EVC campus (NWIC 2011). Construction of
individual buildings and facilities would include site grading and excavation, and thus could uncover
unknown resources.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) Under CEQA, "historic resources" means historic buildings or features or historic or prehistoric
archaeological deposits that qualify for inclusion on the California Register of Historic Resources based
on their historical or prehistoric significance. Several buildings on the campus are identified in the 2025
FMP for demolition. These include the Cluster Acacia, Cluster Roble, Racquetball courts, and all portable
buildings. The Cluster Acacia, Cluster Roble, and Racquetball courts were built in the 1970s. The portable
buildings were constructed in the 2000s. Due to their age, none of these structures appears to be
potentially eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or the California Register of
Historic Resources. Thus, the implementation of the 2025 FMP will have no impact on significant historic
resources.

b) The NWIC was contacted to conduct an archaeological records search for the campus and surrounding
area. The NWIC indicated that there is a high potential of identifying unrecorded Native American
resources on or near the EVC campus because the campus is located at a valley/foothill interface and is
bounded by Yerba Buena creek to the south and because multiple Native American archaeological
resources, including burials, have been found in the vicinity of the campus. In addition, there is a high
potential of identifying unrecorded historic-period archaeological resources on or near the campus as a


Impact Sciences, Inc.                                  27                     Evergreen Valley College 2025 Facilities Master Plan
0461.004                                                                                                                July 2012
review of older maps (1942 San José 15-minute topographic quadrangle and 1876 Historical Atlas of Santa
Clara County) depict buildings within the project area (NWIC 2011). Any inadvertent damage to
significant Native American and historic-period archaeological resources represents a potentially
significant impact. The EIR will analyze the potential impacts related to Native American and historic-
period archaeological resources on campus.

c) While the majority of campus is situated on alluvial fan sediments, sandstone and shale bedrock has
been encountered on campus. The presence of bedrock suggests that the presence of unique
paleontological resources on campus is possible (SJECCD 2000). As a result, there is a possibility that
paleontological resources may exist at deep levels, and disturbance of such resources would result in a
potentially significant impact. However, implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-3 would reduce
impacts to a less than significant level.

                   Mitigation Measure CUL-3: If known, suspected, or potential vertebrate fossil materials are
                   discovered during construction, work will stop within a 75-foot radius of the find until a
                   qualified professional paleontologist (as defined by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology or
                   consistent with Caltrans standards for a Supervising Paleontologist) can assess the nature
                   and importance of the find and recommend appropriate treatment, if any. Based on the
                   paleontologist's professional judgment, treatment may include preparation and recovery of
                   fossil materials so that they can be housed in an appropriate museum or university collection,
                   and may also include preparation of a report for publication describing the finds. The
                   campus will be responsible for ensuring that the paleontologist's recommendations
                   regarding treatment and reporting are implemented.

d) See the responses to Items 5(a) and (b), above. Multiple Native American archaeological resources,
including burials, have been found in the vicinity of the campus. It is therefore possible that human
remains of Native American origin could be present on the campus. Any disturbance of human remains
would represent a potentially significant impact. However, with implementation of Mitigation Measure
CUL-4, which outlines procedures to be followed in the event that previously unknown human remains
are discovered, any impacts would be reduced to a less than significant level.

                   Mitigation Measure CUL-4: In the event of a discovery of human bone, potential human
                   bone, or a known or potential human burial, all ground-disturbing work in the vicinity of the
                   find will halt immediately and the area of the find will be protected until a qualified
                   archaeologist determines whether the bone is human. If the qualified archaeologist
                   determines the bone is human, the Campus will notify the County Coroner of the find.
                   Consistent with California Health and Safety Code Section 7050.5(b), which prohibits
                   disturbance of human remains uncovered by excavation until the Coroner has made a
                   finding relative to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 5097, the Campus will
                   ensure that the remains and vicinity of the find are protected against further disturbance.

                   If it is determined that the find is of Native American origin, the Campus will comply with
                   the provisions of Public Resources Code Section 5097.98 regarding identification and
                   involvement of the Most Likely Descendant (MLD).

                   If the human remains cannot be protected in place following the Coroner's determination, the
                   Campus shall ensure that the qualified archaeologist and the MLD are provided the
                   opportunity to confer on repatriation and/or archaeological treatment of human remains, and

                   that any appropriate studies, as identified through this consultation, are carried out prior to
                   reinterment. The Campus shall provide results of all such studies to the Native American
                   community, and shall provide an opportunity for Native American involvement in any
                   interpretative reporting. As stipulated by the provisions of the California Native American
                   Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the Campus shall ensure that human remains and
                   associated artifacts recovered from campus projects on state lands are repatriated to the
                   appropriate local tribal group if requested.

Anticipated future development in some portions of San José has the potential to adversely affect cultural
resources in the City. However, with mitigation, future development on the campus under the 2025 FMP
would have no project-level impacts on cultural resources. Therefore, implementation of the 2025 FMP
would not make a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact on cultural resources
that could result from other development in the City.

 for the disposal of waste water?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
topography of the campus is relatively flat but is surrounded by hillside areas. The eastern portion of
campus is traversed by the Evergreen fault.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a)(i) An Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone1 associated with the Evergreen fault passes through the
eastern portion of the campus (CGS 2011), and this fault is considered active (URS 2011). However, no
new development associated with the 2025 FMP would occur within the earthquake fault zone, and the
Roble and Acacia cluster buildings that currently lie partly within this zone would be demolished. As a
result, future development on the campus would not expose structures and people to hazards associated
with the rupture of a known earthquake fault. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

a)(ii) The campus could be subject to strong ground shaking in the event of an earthquake originating
along active portions of the Evergreen fault or numerous other faults listed as active or potentially active
in the Bay Area. Development of new buildings and facilities under the 2025 FMP thus could pose a risk
to public safety and property by exposing people, property, or infrastructure to potentially adverse
effects, including strong seismic ground shaking. This impact is considered potentially significant. The
EIR will identify and characterize potential impacts related to strong seismic ground shaking.

a)(iii) The campus is not located in a liquefaction hazard zone designated by the State of California
pursuant to the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 (CGS 2001). As a result, future development on the
campus would not expose structures and people to hazards associated with seismic-related ground
failure, including liquefaction. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

a)(iv) The hills in the northern portion of campus are considered to be susceptible to earthquake-induced
landslides by the State of California pursuant to the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 (CGS 2001).
Although no development is planned in the more steeply sloped hillside areas of campus, future
development adjacent to these slopes could expose structures and people to hazards associated with
landslides. This impact is considered potentially significant. The EIR will identify and characterize
potential impacts related to landslides originating from the surrounding hillside areas.

b) Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would require activities such as vegetation
removal and grading that would expose soil to erosion. For projects that would disturb 1 acre or more,
coverage under the state National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for
Discharges of Storm Water Associated with Construction Activity would be required prior to
construction and the construction contractor would be required to file a notice of intent (NOI) with the
State Water Resources Control Board and develop and implement a site-specific Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that specifies Best Management Practices (BMPs) to control on-site erosion and
off-site sedimentation, and to keep construction pollutants from coming into contact with storm water.
The campus would have oversight responsibility and would have the authority to shut down
construction in the event the SWPPP is improperly implemented. For projects that would disturb less
than 1 acre, the campus would develop an erosion control plan which would include sediment and
erosion controls to limit on-site erosion and off-site sedimentation, and to keep construction pollutants
from coming into contact with storm water. With these measures in place, impacts related to accelerated
erosion and sedimentation are expected to be less than significant.

c) Weak soil layers and lenses occur at random locations and depths beneath the campus (SJECCD 2001).
Therefore, future development on the campus could be located on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable,
or that would become unstable as a result of development. Issues related to seismically induced and non-


1     Prior to 1994, Earthquake Fault Zones were called Special Studies Zones.

seismic landslide hazards are discussed in response to Item (a)(iv), above, and as noted there, will be
addressed in the EIR. Issues related to liquefaction and related hazards are discussed in response to Item
(a)(iii), above, and as noted the impacts would be less than significant. Issues related to soil properties are
discussed in response to Item (d) below, and the impact would be less than significant. Construction of
facilities identified in the 2025 FMP may require the creation of cut or fill slopes, which could be unstable
if they are improperly designed or constructed. However, development would be designed and
constructed in accordance with the current CBC, which includes provisions that specifically address good
grading practices and cut and fill slope stability. Impacts related to unstable cut or fill slopes are therefore
expected to be less than significant.

d) The expansive potential for soils on the eastern portion of campus could cause damage to buildings,
building foundations, roads, and other structures (SJECCD 2001). The properties of native materials that
underlie individual development sites on the campus at depth would be evaluated during the
development of the site-specific geotechnical investigations that the campus will prepare for the project
design of each new facility identified by the 2025 FMP. As discussed above, all facilities identified in the
2025 FMP will adhere to the current CBC, which includes detailed provisions to ensure that the design of
new facilities is appropriate to site soil conditions, including requirements to address expansive and
otherwise problematic soils. With adherence to the CBC, impacts related to site soil conditions--
including but not limited to expansive soils, if any are present--would be less than significant.

e) Future development on the campus under the 2025 FMP would not involve the installation of septic
tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The construction and operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP combined with other current
projects and probable future projects and projected regional growth could result in significant cumulative
impacts with regard to geology and soils. This issue will be addressed in the EIR.

7. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ­ Would the
project:

a) Generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or
indirectly, that may have a significant impact on the

reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a-b) Construction and operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections
on the campus would generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This represents a potentially significant
impact. The EIR will estimate the direct and indirect GHG emissions from the operation of facilities
identified in the 2025 FMP and discuss whether the emissions would exceed the BAAQMD's
recommended thresholds for evaluation of GHG impacts. The EIR will also estimate and report GHG
emissions that would be generated during construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The contribution of the 2025 FMP to the global cumulative impact will be addressed in the EIR.

 8. HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
 ­ Would the project:

 a) Create a significant hazard to the public or the
 environment through the routine transport, use, or                                                                   
 disposal of hazardous materials?

 b) Create a significant hazard to the public or the
 environment through reasonably foreseeable
 upset and accident conditions involving the                                                                          
 release of hazardous materials into the
 environment?

 c) Emit hazardous emissions or handle hazardous
 or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or                                                                       
 waste within one-quarter mile of an existing or
 proposed school?

 d) Be located on a site which is included on a list
 of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to
 Government Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result,                                                                    
 would it create a significant hazard to the public
 or the environment?

 e) For a project located within an airport land use
 plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted,
 within 2 miles of a public airport or public use                                                                     
 airport, would the project result in a safety hazard
 for people residing or working in the project area?

 f) For a project within the vicinity of a private
 airstrip, would the project result in a safety hazard                                                                
 for people residing or working in the project area?

 g) Impair implementation of or physically

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
campus contains several older buildings that are identified for demolition in the 2025 FMP. The closest
schools are Matsumoto Elementary School and Chaboya Middle School, both of which are located
approximately 0.5 mile to the north of the campus, and Laurelwood Elementary School, which is located
about 0.5 mile to the west of the campus. The nearest airport is Reid-Hillview Airport, located
approximately 4 miles to the northwest of the campus.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) Although the construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would use small quantities of
hazardous materials on each construction site, compliance with local, state, and federal regulations would
minimize risks associated with the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials during
construction. Any hazardous materials utilized during the operation of facilities identified in the 2025
FMP would be limited to those typically used in academic support and standard maintenance activities
(e.g., laboratory chemicals, photoprocessing chemicals, solvents, fuels, oils, paints, cleaning agents or
pesticides). The use of all hazardous materials during operation would be required to comply with
stringent local, state, and federal regulations on hazardous materials use. Given the types and small
quantities of hazardous materials that would be used, as well as stringent regulations, the impacts related
to the routine transport, use, and disposal of hazardous materials would be less than significant.

b) See response to Item (a) above. Based on their age, buildings to be demolished as part of the 2025 FMP
could contain asbestos, lead, and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). State law requires that contractors
and workers be notified of the presence of asbestos in buildings constructed before 1979. The California
Department of Public Health requires the certification of employees and supervisors performing lead-
related construction activities in residential and public buildings. Standard specifications included in all
campus construction contracts specify that contractors who disturb or potentially disturb asbestos or lead
must comply with all federal, state, and local rules and regulations regarding these materials. Contractors
are also required to stop work and inform the Campus if they encounter material believed to be asbestos,
PCBs, lead, or other hazardous materials. Compliance with federal, state, and local regulations and
campus procedures would minimize possible exposure to campus employees and students. Therefore,
this impact would be less than significant.

c) See the responses to Items 8(a) and 8(b) above. The campus is not located within 0.25 mile of a school.
There would be no impact with respect to this criterion.

d) The EVC campus is not included on a list of hazardous materials sites subject to corrective action
compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5 (Cortese List). However, as shown in an EDR
report that was prepared for the campus, the campus is included on a number of federal, state, and local
databases. The inclusion of the campus in these databases stems from hazardous waste related to
academic uses and the presence of under and above ground fuel storage tanks on the campus. The
generation of hazardous waste at the EVC campus is related to academic and facilities maintenance uses
and may include laboratory chemicals, photoprocessing chemicals, solvents, fuels, oils, paints, cleaning
agents or pesticides that are currently used in laboratory research, building and grounds maintenance,
vehicle maintenance, and fine arts. In addition, hazard materials associated with electrical transmission
are also located on campus.

Based on the EDR report, there is currently no known contamination on the project site. The EDR report
indicated that several sites with known or potential contamination, hazardous materials use, hazardous
waste generation, or other hazardous-materials-related conditions are within 1 mile of the campus (EDR
2011). Known or potentially contaminated sites near the campus include the church property south of the
campus on Yerba Buena Road and the shopping center located at the corner of San Felipe Road and Yerba
Buena Road. The sources of contamination on these sites include miscellaneous chemicals associated with
cellular equipment on the church property, miscellaneous chemicals, and photochemical waste associated
with retail uses in the shopping center, and auto wrecking facilities located in the shopping center. Other
potential sources of contamination in the vicinity of the project site include hydrocarbons from leaking
underground storage tanks, chemical use and waste, and the presence of chemicals in the soil due to past
agricultural use in the area (EDR 2011). Because of the site status and orientation relative to groundwater
flow direction for the identified sites, it is unlikely that groundwater contamination from these sites may
have migrated to the campus (EDR 2011). However, given the uncertainty of contamination on the project
site from sources off site, this assessment conservatively assumes that contamination could be present
and, if encountered during construction, could result in the exposure of the public or construction
workers to hazardous materials. This is considered a potentially significant impact. However, with the
implementation of Mitigation Measure HAZ-1, which requires an assessment and cleanup of potential
contamination that may be encountered during construction, this impact would be reduced to a less than
significant level.

                   Mitigation Measure HAZ-1: If evidence of contaminated soil and/or groundwater, such as
                   discolored soil, odors or oil sheen, is encountered during the removal of on-site debris or
                   during excavation and/or grading both on and off site, the construction contractors shall stop
                   work and immediately inform the Campus. An environmental hazardous materials
                   professional shall be contracted to conduct an on-site assessment. If the materials are
                   determined to pose a risk to the public or construction workers, the construction contractor
                   shall prepare and submit a remediation plan to the appropriate agency and comply with all
                   federal, state, and local laws. Soil remediation methods could include excavation and on-site
                   treatment, excavation and off-site treatment or disposal, and/or treatment without
                   excavation. Remediation alternatives for cleanup of contaminated groundwater could
                   include in-situ treatment, extraction and on-site treatment, or extraction and off-site
                   treatment and/or disposal. Construction plans shall be modified or construction postponed to
                   ensure that construction will not inhibit remediation activities and will not expose the public
                   or construction workers to hazardous conditions.

e) The campus is not located within the immediate vicinity of the Reid-Hillview Airport. Given the
distance of the campus from the airport, future development under the 2025 FMP would not place
persons within an airport hazard zone. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

f) The campus is not located in the vicinity of a private airstrip, and there would be no impact with regard
to this criterion.

g) The City of San José Emergency Operations Plan does not list Yerba Buena Road or San Felipe Road as
emergency evacuation routes (City of San José 2004). In addition, construction of facilities identified in
the 2025 FMP would occur within the boundaries of the campus, and thus would not impede traffic on
roadways surrounding campus. In addition, the Campus would keep all campus roadways open during
construction so that emergency response and evacuation is not affected. There would be no impact with
regard to this criterion.

h) The EVC campus is not located in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, as designated by maps
prepared by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire 2008). There would be no
impact with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Anticipated future development in San José has the potential to expose the public and the environment to
risks associated with hazards from on-site contamination and routine use of hazardous materials.
However, with mitigation, future development under the 2025 FMP would not expose the public and the
environment to potential on-site contamination during construction. In addition, while the operation of
campus facilities would involve the routine use of hazardous materials in small amounts, the use of these
materials on campus would comply with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations. Therefore, the
proposed project would not contribute to a cumulative impact during operation.

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus.
Construction of individual buildings and facilities would include site grading and excavation. All runoff
from pavements, roofs, and other impervious surfaces that are developed on campus flows and would
continue to flow to Thompson Creek, which is located to the west of the campus across San Felipe Road.
The campus is underlain by the Santa Clara groundwater basin (DWR 2003). The campus is not located
within a 100-year flood plain or a flood inundation zone (FEMA 2009). The nearest body of water is the
Cherry Flat Reservoir, located 4 miles northeast of the campus. The San Francisco Bay is located about
19 miles northwest of the campus.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) During construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP, there is a potential for increased erosion,
sedimentation, and discharge of polluted runoff from the site. However, as identified in Geology and
Soils Item 6(b), the construction contractor would be required to implement a SWPPP including erosion
and pollution control measures in compliance with NPDES regulations, or implement an erosion control
plan as required by campus procedures to control increases in off-site sediment delivery. The impact to
water quality from construction activities would therefore be less than significant.

The development of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would increase the amount of impervious
surfaces on the campus and would increase the amount of runoff generated on the campus. During
operation, all site drainage would be routed to the City's storm drain system, which would then
discharge the flow to Thompson Creek. This runoff is subject to the conditions of the Municipal Regional
Stormwater NPDES Permit No. CAS612008 for the San Francisco Bay Region. This permit requires
permittees to comply with the discharge prohibitions and receiving water limitations through the timely
implementation of control measures and other actions as specified in the permit (San Francisco Bay
RWQCB, 2009). Future development on the campus would be required to comply with applicable NPDES
requirements for stormwater quality. Therefore, implementation of the 2025 FMP would not result in any
direct or indirect discharges that would violate water quality standards or waste discharge requirements.
Impacts during operation would be less than significant with regard to this criterion.

b) The campus is underlain by the Santa Clara groundwater basin. However, the campus obtains its
potable water supply from surface water supplies provided through the local water retailer. Therefore,
the increase in potable water use on the campus from implementation of the 2025 FMP would not impact
groundwater supplies. Natural recharge in the basin occurs principally as infiltration in streambeds that
exit the upland areas within the drainage basin and from direct percolation of precipitation that falls on

0461.004                                                                                                                  July 2012
the basin floor (DWR 2003). Implementation of the 2025 FMP would increase the amount of impervious
surface on the campus. However, as this increase in impervious surface would be small, it would have a
minimal effect on groundwater recharge. Impacts would be less than significant with regard to this
criterion.

c) While the erosion potential of a majority of soils on the campus is none to slight, the erosion potential
of soils on the northeastern portion of the campus is medium to high (SJECCD 2001). Storm water
generated by future development under the 2025 FMP would be directed toward existing storm drainage
facilities serving the campus. As discussed in Geology and Soils Item 6(b) above, each individual project
on the campus would be required to control soil erosion and siltation during construction through either
the preparation of a SWPPP if the project is 1 acre or more in size or the preparation of an erosion control
plan if the project is less than 1 acre in size. Implementation of the SWPPP would reduce the potential for
erosion on the construction sites and minimize the discharge of sediment into the storm drain system.
Once the new or replacement facilities are constructed, the project sites would be either under impervious
surfaces (buildings, pavement, etc.) or would be landscaped. This would minimize the potential for
erosion and sedimentation in the long run. In addition, while the implementation of the 2025 FMP would
increase the amount of impervious surface on the campus, this increase in impervious surface would be
small. As a result, the amount of additional runoff entering the City's storm drain system would not be
substantial enough to result in off-site erosion or siltation in downstream locations. Therefore, this impact
is considered less than significant.

d) As discussed in the previous response above, storm water generated by future development under the
2025 FMP would be directed toward existing storm drainage facilities serving the campus. There are no
existing flooding problems on the campus, and each project built on the campus would be designed to
avoid on-site flooding. In addition, while the implementation of the 2025 FMP would increase the amount
of impervious surface on the campus, this increase in impervious surface would be small. However, the
amount of additional runoff entering the City's storm drain system could be substantial enough to
contribute to existing flooding problems along Thompson Creek (SJECCD 2001). This represents a
potentially significant impact. The EIR will analyze the potential impacts related to flooding on or near
the campus.

e) Implementation of the 2025 FMP would increase impervious surfaces on campus, which could increase
the volume of stormwater runoff in the City's storm drain system. Although this increase in runoff would
be small, it could exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater drainage systems because of lack
of capacity in Thompson Creek to accept stormwater runoff during flood conditions. This represents a
potentially significant impact. The EIR will analyze the potential impacts related to stormwater system
capacity.

See response to Item 9(a) above with regard to water quality. Implementation of the 2025 FMP would not
provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff. Therefore, this impact is considered less than
significant.

f) See responses to Items 9(a) through (d), above, and related discussions in the Hazards and Hazardous
Materials Section of this checklist. No other potential project impacts to water quality were identified.

g-h) The campus is not located within a 100-year flood zone. The campus is located within Flood Zone D,
which is defined as an area with undetermined flooding, but where flooding is possible (FEMA 2009).
There are no existing residential uses on campus and no residential uses are included in the 2025 FMP. As

a result, implementation of the 2025 FMP would not place housing or structures within an area at risk of
flood flows. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

i) The campus is not located within the dam inundation area for the Cherry Flats Reservoir (ABAG 1995).
Therefore, implementation of the 2025 FMP would not expose people or structures to a significant risk of
loss, injury or death involving flooding, including flooding as a result of the failure of a levee or dam.
There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

j) The campus is located well inland from the San Francisco Bay and no bodies of water are located in the
vicinity of the campus. As a result, the campus is not at risk of seiche or tsunami inundation. Because of
the location of the campus in flat topography there is no substantial risk of debris flow or mudflow. There
would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Anticipated future development in San José could result in the violation of water quality or waste
discharge requirements during construction. However, construction projects in the City involving 1 acre
or more of land disturbance are required to prepare and implement a SWPPP that includes erosion and
pollution control measures and measures to control increases in off-site sediment delivery. Furthermore,
construction projects on the campus would be required to adhere to NPDES requirements for
construction activities. As a result, the cumulative impact with regard to water quality would be less than
significant.

The construction and operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP combined with other current
projects and probable future projects and projected regional growth could result in or contribute to
flooding problems along local creeks. This issue will be addressed in the EIR.

Anticipated future development in San José could place housing or structures within a 100-year flood
zone or within a tsunami inundation area. However, as the campus is not located within either a 100-year
flood zone or within a tsunami inundation area, future development anticipated under the 2025 FMP
would not contribute to this impact.

 adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an
 environmental effect?

 c) Conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan                                                           
 or natural community conservation plan?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) Implementation of the 2025 FMP would not physically divide an established community since the
campus already exists, and future development on the campus would occur with campus boundaries.
There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

b) The SJECCD is not subject to local plans, policies, or regulations. However, SJECCD is required by
Section 15125(d) of the State CEQA Guidelines to address inconsistencies between its proposed project and
applicable general plans, specific plans, and regional plans. It is generally the policy of the SJECCD to be
consistent with local and regional plans, policies, or regulations to the maximum extent possible. Any
conflict between the 2025 FMP and applicable local and regional plans could result in a potentially
significant impact. The EIR will discuss the consistency of the 2025 FMP with applicable regional plans
which include the Bay Area 2010 Clean Air Plan, State Water Quality Control Board NPDES Permit, Santa
Clara Valley Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention Program, and Santa Clara County Congestion
Management Program.

c) There is no habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan applicable to the
campus. There would be no impact related to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The proposed project combined with other current projects and probable future projects and projected
regional growth could result in significant cumulative impacts with regard to consistency with regional
plans. This issue will be addressed in the EIR.

 11. MINERAL RESOURCES ­ Would the
 project:

 a) Result in the loss of availability of a known
 mineral resource that would be of value to the

 b) Result in the loss of availability of a locally
 important mineral resource recovery site                                                                                  
 delineated on a local general plan, specific plan
 or other land use plan?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
City of San José 2020 General Plan does not designate the campus vicinity as a mineral resource area (San
José 1994).

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a, b) The campus is not designated as a mineral resource area, and no known or potential mineral
resources are located on the campus. In addition, existing land uses preclude the use of the campus for
mineral extraction (e.g., sand and gravel). Therefore, future development on the campus would not
impede extraction or result in the loss of availability of a known mineral resource. There would be no
impacts with regard to these criteria.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The City of San José is urban in nature, and minerals are not found to any appreciable extent in the City.
As a result, anticipated future development in San José, including future development on the campus
under the 2025 FMP, would not result in the loss of availability of mineral resources. The cumulative
impact would be less than significant.

 12. NOISE ­ Would the project result in:

 a) Exposure of persons to or generation of noise
 levels in excess of standards established in any                                                                  
 applicable plan or noise ordinance, or applicable
 standards of other agencies?

 b) Exposure of persons to or generation of
 excessive groundborne vibration or groundborne                                                                    
 noise levels?

 c) A substantial permanent increase in ambient
 noise levels in the project vicinity above levels                                                                 
 existing without the project?

 d) A substantial temporary or periodic increase in
 ambient noise levels in the project vicinity above

 construction)?

 e) For a project located within an airport land use
 plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted,
 within 2 miles of a public airport or public use                                                                  
 airport, would the project expose people residing
 or working in the project area to excessive noise
 levels?

 f) For a project within the vicinity of a private
 airstrip, would the project expose people residing                                                                
 or working in the project area to excessive noise
 levels?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus.
Construction of each individual facility would generate noise, and once construction is completed, the
operation of each individual facility would add to current sources of traffic noise by redirecting and
rerouting vehicle trips to nearby roadways. The nearest sensitive receptors to the campus include single-
family residential uses to the north, south, and west of the campus. Other sensitive receptors in the
vicinity of the campus include Evergreen Park and Church on the Rock - Baptist to the south;
Montgomery Hill Park to the east; and an assisted-living facility to the west. The nearest airport is Reid-
Hillview Airport, located approximately 4 miles to the northwest of the campus.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) Implementation of the 2025 FMP could result in increases or changes in noise levels from sources such
as construction activities, stationary sources, and increased vehicular traffic, which could exceed
applicable noise standards. For example, construction activity or new stationary sources could exceed
State's exterior noise standard of 70 A-weighted decibels (dB(A)) community noise equivalent level
(CNEL) for schools. These impacts are considered potentially significant. The EIR will evaluate the
potential for facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to expose people to noise in excess of State standards.

b) Construction activities associated with the 2025 FMP could generate excessive groundborne vibration
and noise on and near the campus. This represents a potentially significant impact. The EIR will evaluate
the potential for increased groundborne vibration or noise levels associated with construction of facilities
identified in the 2025 FMP to affect nearby sensitive receptors.

c) Vehicle traffic associated with facilities identified in the 2025 FMP could result in substantial
permanent increases in ambient noise levels in the vicinity of the project site. These impacts are
considered potentially significant. The EIR will evaluate the potential for facilities identified in the 2025
FMP to permanently increase ambient noise levels.

d) Construction activities associated with the 2025 FMP could result in substantial temporary increases in
ambient noise levels on campus and in the vicinity of the project. These impacts are considered
potentially significant. The EIR will evaluate the potential for the construction of facilities identified in the
2025 FMP to temporarily increase ambient noise levels.

e) The campus is not located within the immediate vicinity of an airport. Other than aircraft overflights,
the project site would not be exposed to noise from public airports. There would be no impact with
respect to this criterion.

f) The proposed project is not located in the vicinity of a private airstrip, and there would be no impact
with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Future development under the 2025 FMP combined with other current projects and probable future
projects and projected regional growth could result in significant cumulative noise impacts. This issue
will be addressed in the EIR.

 13. POPULATION AND HOUSING ­ Would the
 project:

 a) Induce substantial population growth in an area,
 either directly (for example, by proposing new homes                                                               
 and businesses) or indirectly (for example, through
 extension of roads or other infrastructure)?

 b) Displace substantial numbers of existing housing,
 necessitating the construction of replacement housing                                                              
 elsewhere?

 c) Displace substantial numbers of people, necessitating                                                           
 the construction of replacement housing elsewhere?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus.
Implementation of the 2025 FMP would accommodate an increase in enrollment on campus from
approximately 12,000 to 14,850 students by 2025. A corresponding increase in faculty and staff on the
campus is also anticipated.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) The EVC campus does not provide housing for students, faculty, or staff, and students and employees
commute to the campus from the surrounding communities. As enrollment grows, more students will
commute to the campus from the surrounding communities; it is unlikely that students would move into
the San Jose area with the single purpose of being closer to campus. New faculty and staff required to
serve the increase in enrollment would likely be living in the Bay Area at the time of hire and even if
some of them are new to the Bay Area, they could live anywhere in the region and commute to the
campus. Therefore, it is unlikely that a substantial number of students or employees would be added to
the San Jose area as a result of project implementation. Therefore, this impact is considered less than
significant.

b) The campus is currently developed with academic and related uses. No housing exists on the campus,
and there would be no impact with respect to this criterion.

c) See response to Item 13(b), above. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Anticipated future development in San José would result in an increase in population throughout the
City, which could result in an overall population that exceeds population projections. As discussed
above, the increase in San Jose area population as a result of 2025 FMP implementation would not be
substantial. Therefore, the contribution of the 2025 FMP to this impact would not be cumulatively
considerable.

 14. PUBLIC SERVICES ­ Would the
 project:

 Would the project result in substantial adverse physical
 impacts associated with the provision of new or
 physically altered governmental facilities, need for new
 or physically altered governmental facilities, the
 construction of which could cause significant
 environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable
 service ratios, response times or other performance
 objectives for any of the public services:

 a) Fire protection?                                                                                               
 b) Police protection?                                                                                             
 c) Schools?                                                                                                       
 d) Parks?                                                                                                         
 e) Other public facilities?                                                                                       
Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
City of San José Fire Department provides fire protection services to the campus. The San José/Evergreen
Valley Community College District (SJECCD) Police Department provides law enforcement services to
the campus. The closest parks to the campus are Montgomery Hill Park, Falls Creek Park, and Evergreen
Park. Montgomery Hills Park is located adjacent to the campus to the east, Falls Creek Park is located
approximately 1,000 feet northwest of the campus, and Evergreen Park is located about 1,000 feet
southeast of the campus. The closest off-campus library, the Evergreen Branch Library, is located
approximately 2 miles from the campus.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) Implementation of the 2025 FMP would result in additional facilities and population on the campus.
This increase in campus facilities and population could place additional demand on the San José Fire
Department for fire protection services, and may result in the need for new or expanded fire protection
facilities, the construction of which could result in significant environmental impacts. This impact is
considered potentially significant, and will be further analyzed in the EIR.

b) Implementation of the 2025 FMP may include the expansion of the existing SJECCD Police Department
facility on campus. The EIR will analyze the biological, air quality, and noise effects of expanding the
SJECCD Police Department facility along with the biological, air quality and noise effects of the other

facilities under the 2025 FMP. The potential effects on cultural resources from constructing new or
expanded facilities, including the SJECCD Police Department facility, are addressed in Item 5, above.

c) No residential uses are associated with the 2025 FMP. Therefore, future development on the campus
would not result in a direct impact on schools due to an increase in residential population. As noted in
response to Item 13(a) above, new students, faculty, and staff associated with the 2025 FMP would likely
be living in the surrounding communities or in the wider Bay Area at the time of enrollment or hire. To
the extent that new students or employees move into Bay Area communities to study or work at the
college, their numbers would not be large and would not add a substantial number of school age students
to any one community. This impact is considered less than significant.

d) No residential uses are associated with the 2025 FMP. Therefore, future development on the campus
would not result in a direct impact on parks due to an increase in residential population. Three parks are
located in the immediate vicinity of the campus. Due to their proximity, it is possible that some students,
faculty, and staff could utilize these facilities. However, existing recreational facilities are located on the
campus and future recreational facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would be available to meet the needs
of the campus population. Therefore, the use of off-campus parks is expected to be minimal and the
impact of the campus population on existing parks in the vicinity of the campus would be less than
significant.

e) No residential uses are associated with the 2025 FMP. Therefore, future development on the campus
would not result in a direct impact on other public facilities such as libraries due to an increase in
residential population. The closest off-campus library is located approximately 2 miles from the campus.
Due to the distance, it is unlikely that students, faculty, and staff would utilize this facility. In addition,
the campus has an existing library that is available to the campus population for use. For this reasons, the
impact on public libraries would be less than significant.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Future development under the 2025 FMP combined with other current projects and probable future
projects and projected regional growth could result in significant cumulative impacts with regard to fire
protection services provided by the San Jose City Fire Department. This issue will be addressed in the
EIR.

Future development under the 2025 FMP combined with future development on the San Jose City
College campus could result in significant cumulative impacts with regard to police protection services
provided by the SJECCD Police Department. This issue will be addressed in the EIR.

Although substantial portions of the City are built out, future development or redevelopment would
increase population in the City, thus resulting in an increase in demand for schools, parks and other
public facilities such as libraries. As a result of the increased demand, future growth in the City may
require new or physically altered facilities to accommodate staff and equipment to meet increased
demand, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts. As the 2025 FMP does
not include a residential component, the proposed project would not have any direct impacts on schools,
parks, or libraries. For reasons presented in responses to Items 14 (c), (d), and (e) above, any indirect
impacts would be minimal. Therefore, the project's contribution to the cumulative impact would not be
cumulatively considerable.

 facilities such that substantial physical deterioration of
 the facility would occur or be accelerated?

 b) Does the project include recreational facilities or
 require the construction or expansion of recreational                                                                 
 facilities, which might have an adverse physical effect on
 the environment?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. Under
the 2025 FMP, the racquetball courts would be demolished while a new fitness center would be
constructed. The closest parks to the campus are Montgomery Hill Park, Falls Creek Park, and Evergreen
Park.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) See the response to Item 14(d) above. Given the presence of existing recreational facilities on the
campus and the construction of future facilities identified in the 2025 FMP, the increase in campus
population under the 2025 FMP would not result in an increase in the use of existing neighborhood and
regional parks or other recreational facilities such that substantial physical deterioration of existing
facilities would occur or be accelerated. Therefore, the impact on recreational facilities would be less than
significant.

b) No public parks or recreational facilities would be constructed as part of the 2025 FMP. The 2025 FMP
includes recreational facilities for use by the campus and community, the construction of which could
result in adverse physical effects on the environment. The EIR will analyze the biological, air quality, and
noise effects of constructing these recreational facilities. The effects to cultural resources of constructing
the proposed facilities included in the 2025 FMP, including these recreational facilities, are addressed
above in Item 5.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Anticipated future development in San José would increase the extent of development in the City, thus
resulting in a cumulative increase in the use of recreational facilities. As a result, future growth in the City
may cause substantial physical deterioration of recreational facilities to occur or be accelerated, or may
require the construction or expansion of recreational facilities, the construction of which could cause
significant environmental impacts. As discussed above, no residential population is associated with 2025
FMP that would require parks or other City recreational facilities and existing and future recreational
facilities on the campus would serve the campus population. Therefore, the project would not make a
substantial contribution to the cumulative impact with regard to the deterioration of recreational

 facilities?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
campus is 2.5 miles east of the US 101. Roadways that serve the campus include Yerba Buena Road to the
south and San Felipe Road to the west. Yerba Buena Road is designated as a major collector while San
Felipe Road is designated as an arterial roadway by the City of San José 2020 General Plan (City of San
José 1994).

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a-b) Implementation of the 2025 FMP could potentially cause an increase in traffic on surrounding
roadways or redirect traffic that is already in the area. These potential changes in traffic and circulation in
the vicinity of the campus could result in congestion. This represents a potentially significant impact. A

detailed Traffic Impact Study will be prepared to evaluate the impacts of the 2025 FMP on local roadway
capacity and this issue will be addressed in the EIR.

c) The 2025 FMP does not include uses that would affect air traffic or result in changes to air patterns.
There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

d) The 2005 FMP includes recommended vehicular and pedestrian circulation plans. The proposed
design of the circulation plans could result in pedestrian and vehicle conflicts on the campus. This
represents a potentially significant impact. The effects of the recommended vehicular and pedestrian
circulation plans on public safety will be analyzed in the EIR.

e) Implementation of the 2025 Facilities Master Plan would result in the construction of new buildings
and new roadways on the EVC campus, thus requiring emergency access. The issue of emergency access
considers both the regional accessibility of the campus and access within the campus itself. From a
regional perspective, the accessibility for emergency vehicles is more than adequate. Once emergency
vehicles have traveled to the campus, the internal roadway network is adequate to allow these vehicles to
reach their designated locations. Implementation of the 2025 FMP would improve existing circulation on
campus by adding a new loop road to the northern portion of campus. As a result, implementation of the
2025 Facilities Master Plan would not result in inadequate emergency access and this impact is
considered less than significant.

f) The EIR will describe the existing adopted policies, plans, and/or programs supporting alternative
transportation on the campus. Any conflicts between the 2025 FMP and alternative transportation
represent a potentially significant impact. The effects of the 2025 FMP on alternative transportation will
be analyzed in the EIR.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Implementation of the 2025 FMP combined with other current projects and probable future projects and
projected regional growth could result in significant cumulative impacts with regard to
transportation/traffic. This issue will be addressed in the EIR.

 project:

 a) Exceed wastewater treatment requirements of the                                                                  
 applicable Regional Water Quality Control Board?

 b) Require or result in the construction of new water or
 wastewater treatment facilities or expansion of existing                                                            
 facilities, the construction of which could cause
 significant environmental effects?

 c) Require or result in the construction of new storm
 water drainage facilities or expansion of existing                                                                  
 facilities, the construction of which could cause
 significant environmental effects?

 d) Have sufficient water supplies available to serve the
 project from existing entitlements and resources, or are                                                            
 new or expanded entitlements needed?

 e) Result in a determination by the wastewater treatment
 provider which serves or may serve the project, that it
 has inadequate capacity to serve the project's projected                                                            
 demand in addition to the provider's existing
 commitments?

 f) Be served by a landfill with sufficient permitted
 capacity to accommodate the project's solid waste                                                                   
 disposal needs?

 g) Comply with applicable federal, state, and local                                                                 
 statutes and regulations related to solid waste?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus.
Wastewater generated on the campus is treated at the San José/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant
(WPCP). Potable water is supplied to the campus by the San Jose Municipal Water System.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) The San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) regulates water quality and
quantity of effluent discharged from the WPCP. Implementation of the 2025 FMP would increase the
volume of wastewater received at the WPCP for treatment. Any exceedance of treatment requirements at
the WPCP due to the increase in wastewater from the campus under the 2025 FMP would result in a

0461.004                                                                                                             July 2012
potentially significant impact. The effects of campus development under the 2025 FMP on the ability of
the WPCP to meet wastewater treatment requirements set by the San Francisco Bay RWQCB will be
analyzed in the EIR.

b, e) Implementation of the 2025 FMP would result in an increase in water use and generation of
wastewater. This increase may result in the need for new water or wastewater treatment and conveyance
facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant
environmental effects. This represents a potentially significant impact. The effects of the 2025 FMP on
existing water and wastewater treatment facilities will be analyzed in the EIR.

c) Implementation of the 2025 FMP would increase impervious surfaces on the campus, which could
increase the volume of stormwater drainage conveyed to existing stormwater facilities. Although the
increase would be relatively small, the amount of stormwater drainage generated on campus could
exceed the capacity of existing stormwater facilities, due to existing capacity constraints. New storm
drain facilities may be required, the construction of which could cause significant environmental effects.
This represents a potentially significant impact. The effects of the 2025 FMP on existing stormwater
facilities will be analyzed in the EIR.

d) Implementation of the 2025 FMP would result in an increase in demand for water on the campus and
this demand may exceed the amount of water available to the San Jose Municipal Water System from
existing entitlements and resources. This represents a potentially significant impact. The effects of the
2025 FMP on existing water entitlement and resources will be analyzed in the EIR.

f, g) Implementation of the 2025 FMP could result in an increase in solid waste generated on the campus.
Recology Silicon Valley collects and disposes of solid waste that is generated by the campus. The amount
of solid waste generated on the campus requiring disposal could potentially exceed the capacity of local
landfills. In addition, implementation of the 2025 FMP could conflict with applicable federal, state, and
local statutes and regulations related to solid waste. This represents a potentially significant impact. The
effects of the 2025 FMP on landfill capacity and compliance with applicable regulations will be analyzed
in the EIR.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Implementation of the 2025 FMP combined with other current projects and probable future projects and
projected regional growth could result in significant cumulative impacts with regard to utilities. This
issue will be addressed in the EIR.

 18. MANDATORY FINDINGS OF SIGNIFICANCE ­ Would the
 project:

 a) Does the project have the potential to degrade the
 quality of the environment, substantially reduce the
 habitat of a fish or wildlife species, cause a fish or
 wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining levels,
 threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community,                                                                  
 substantially reduce the number or restrict the range of a
 rare or endangered plant or animal or eliminate
 important examples of the major periods of California
 history or prehistory?

 b) Does the project have impacts that are individually
 limited, but cumulatively considerable? ("Cumulatively
 considerable" means that the incremental effects of a
 project are significant when viewed in connection with                                                              
 the effects of past projects, the effects of other current
 projects, and the effects of past, present and probable
 future projects)?

 c) Does the project have environmental effects which
 will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings,                                                             
 either directly or indirectly?

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) Please refer to responses under Biological Resources Items 4(a) through (f), and Cultural Resources
Items 5(a) through (d), above. While future development on the campus could eliminate examples of
California history or prehistory, implementation of mitigation measures identified in this Initial Study
would reduce all impacts to a less than significant level. However, future development on campus could
significantly affect fish or wildlife habitat. This impact is considered potentially significant. The EIR will
identify and analyze potential impacts to fish and wildlife habitat.

b) An analysis of whether the potential impacts of the proposed project combined with other current
projects and probable future projects and projected regional growth in the surrounding area would result
in significant cumulative impacts will be included in the EIR.

c) As indicated in the preceding discussion, implementation of the 2025 FMP has the potential to result in
potentially significant impacts. An evaluation of whether any of those impacts would have the potential
to result in substantial effects to human beings will be included in the EIR.

* Several adjustments were made to transportation emissions after they have been imported from URBEMIS.  
After importing from URBEMIS, CO2 emissions are converted to metric tons and then adjusted to account for the "Pavley" 
regulation.  Then, CO2 is converted to CO2e by multiplying by 100/95 to account for the contribution of other GHGs (CH4, N2O, and HFCs [from leaking air condit
Finally, CO2e is adjusted to account for th low carbon fuels rule.

* Several adjustments were made to transportation emissions after they have been imported from URBEMIS.  
After importing from URBEMIS, CO2 emissions are converted to metric tons and then adjusted to account for the "Pavley" 
regulation.  Then, CO2 is converted to CO2e by multiplying by 100/95 to account for the contribution of other GHGs (CH4, N2O, and HFCs [from leaking air condit
Finally, CO2e is adjusted to account for th low carbon fuels rule.

January 2012



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) for the Facilities Master Plan of the
Evergreen Valley College (EVC) located in Santa Clara County, California. EVC is bounded by Falls Creek
Drive to the north, San Felipe Road to the west, and Yerba Buena Road to the east and south.

The Educational and Facilities Master Plan Update ­ 2025 (June 22, 2010) is a comprehensive plan
highlighting the future educational and facility needs of the College. The plan projects an annual student
population growth rate of 1.84 percent through 2025, resulting in an increase in the student population of
approximately 2,863 students over the life of the plan. To accommodate the projected growth, the Project
includes construction of a new Arts Complex and Physical Education expansion, in conjunction with other
facilities, totaling 42,800 square-feet.

The analysis was conducted to identify potential transportation impacts of the proposed project on the
surrounding roadway system and to recommend appropriate improvements to mitigate significant impacts.
The roadway system was evaluated under Existing, Existing plus Project, Cumulative no Project and
Cumulative plus Project Conditions.

PROJECT TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
The amount of traffic generated by the proposed project was estimated by applying rates based on data
collected at the San Jose City College driveways. Community college trip generation rates per student were
determined for the AM and PM peak hours. The proposed project is estimated to generate 3,981 net new
daily trips, 315 new AM peak-hour trips (251 inbound and 64 outbound) and 381 new PM peak-hour trips (249
inbound and 132 outbound).

INTERSECTION IMPACTS

US 101 SB Off-Ramp & Yerba Buena Road

The proposed Project would result in a significant impact at the US 101 SB Off-Ramp / Yerba Buena Road
signalized intersection in the cumulative condition. This intersection operates at an unacceptable LOS F
under both the AM and PM peak hour conditions without the addition of project related trips. Project related
increases would satisfy either the V/C or vehicle delay thresholds.

The US 101 SB Off-Ramp / Yerba Buena Road signalized intersection is physically constrained. To improve
operating conditions to an acceptable level, widening of the intersection to provide additional capacity would
be required. Substantial improvement could only be accomplished through extensive demolition and
reconstruction of facilities and/or right-of-way acquisition; therefore, the measure was not further considered.
Additionally, this intersection is a Caltrans facility and even if there were not physical constraints, ,
implementation of improvements cannot be guaranteed by the City. Traffic impacts at this intersection under
the Cumulative Plus Project conditions would remain significant and unavoidable.

San Felipe Road & Yerba Buena Road

The proposed Project would result in significant impact at the San Felipe Road / Yerba Buena Road
signalized intersection in the cumulative condition. This intersection operates at an unacceptable LOS E
under both the AM and PM peak hour conditions without the addition of project related trips. Project related
increases would satisfy either the V/C or vehicle delay thresholds.

Mitigation Measure: Construct a second eastbound left-turn.

With implementation of this mitigation measure, operations at this intersection would improve to an
acceptable LOS D in both the AM and PM peak hours. Installation of the second eastbound left-turn lane



                                                                                                                 i

would require reconstruction of the center median and restriping of the eastbound lanes, but should not
require additional right-of-way. Construction of the mitigation measure shall be the responsibility of the City.
With the installation of this mitigation measure, the traffic impact at the San Felipe Road / Yerba Buena Road
intersection would be reduced to a less-than-significant impact.

Aborn Road & White Road / San Felipe Road

The proposed Project would result in significant impact at the Aborn Road & White Road / San Felipe Road
signalized intersection in the cumulative condition. This intersection operates at an unacceptable LOS E
under the PM peak hour conditions without the addition of project related trips and the addition of Project trips
would increase the V/C or vehicle delay thresholds beyond acceptable limits. Additionally, Project related
trips worsen acceptable LOS D to unacceptable LOS E conditions during the AM peak hour.

Mitigation Measure: Construct a second westbound left-turn.

With implementation of this mitigation measure, operations at this intersection would improve to an
acceptable LOS D during the AM peak hour. The PM peak hour would continue to operate at LOS E;
however, delay and V/C would no longer trigger the threshold of significance. Installation of the second
westbound left-turn lane would require restriping of the center median and would not require additional right-
of-way. Construction of the mitigation measure shall be the responsibility of the City. With the installation of
this mitigation measure, the traffic impact at the Aborn Road & White Road / San Felipe Road intersection
would be reduced to a less-than-significant impact.

East Capitol Expressway & Aborn Road

The East Capitol Expressway / Aborn Road intersection operates at an unacceptable LOS F under
Cumulative No Project and Cumulative Plus Project Conditions during the AM and PM peak hour. The
increase in critical V/C and delay does not exceed the one percent and four second threshold, respectively.
Therefore, the impact to this intersection would be considered less-than-significant.

East Capitol Expressway & Silver Creek Road

The East Capitol Expressway / Aborn Road intersection operates at an unacceptable LOS E under Existing
and Existing plus Project Conditions during the PM peak hour but is not considered a significant impact
because the increase in critical V/C and delay did not exceed the one percent and four second threshold,
respectively. Therefore, the impact to this intersection would be considered less-than-significant.

The East Capitol Expressway / Silver Creek Road intersection operates at an unacceptable LOS E under
Cumulative No Project and Cumulative Plus Project Conditions during the AM peak hour. The increase in
critical V/C and delay does not exceed the one percent and four second threshold, respectively. Therefore,
the impact to this intersection would be considered less-than-significant.

FREEWAY SEGMENT IMPACTS
The proposed Project would not significantly impact any study freeway segments in the study area.

PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE, AND TRANSIT FACILITY IMPACTS
The proposed Project would not significantly impact pedestrian, bicycle, or transit facilities in the study area
because the proposed project does not conflict with any existing or proposed pedestrian, bicycle, or transit
facilities and the proposed Project does not create hazardous conditions for pedestrians, bicyclists, or transit
riders.




                                                                                                               ii

SITE ACCESS, ON-SITE CIRCULATION, AND PARKING

Site Access

The EVC campus can currently be accessed from locations along San Felipe Road and Yerba Buena Road.
Site access is considered adequate for the volume of traffic generated by the site. Paseo de Arboles would be
maintained as the primary access to San Felipe Road and would continue to be controlled by a signalized
intersection at San Felipe Road. Valle del Laeo, which currently provides access to Yerba Buena Road, will
be converted to a pedestrian pathway. However, several new vehicular access points would be constructed
along Yerba Buena Road. The access points would have little conflicting traffic and would be stop-controlled
intersections. Based on the trip generation estimates, forecasted demand would be adequately served by
these access points. Driveway spacing and sight distance at the new driveways would be adequate.

On-Site Circulation

On-site circulation would be provided by internal roadways and driveways. These facilities would connect the
various parking lots to each other. While a connection is currently provided around the perimeter of the
campus, it is not designed as a formal roadway. The Facilities Master Plan identifies a loop road that
connects Paseo de Arboles and the west side of the campus to the new access on the east side of campus.
The inner core of campus would provide a series of interconnected pedestrian pathways, including a central
pedestrian promenade that connects the west plaza and east plaza.

Generally, bicycles are not allowed to be ridden through the campus core. The site plan shows ample bicycle
parking along the periphery of the campus core adjacent to campus buildings

Parking

The proposed Project would result in a potentially significant impact if a construction management and
phasing plan is not developed to ensure adequate parking is provided throughout the implementation of the
Facilities Master Plan.

Mitigation Measure: Develop a Construction Management Plan and Project Phasing.

With implementation of this mitigation measure, adequate parking for levels of enrollment during different
phases of construction can be secured. Temporary parking or travel demand management may be
acceptable tools used to manage parking demands. With the execution of this mitigation measure, the impact
to parking would be reduced to a less-than-significant impact.

1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the analysis and findings of the Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) for the Evergreen
Valley College (EVC) Facilities Master Plan (Project). EVC is located in San Jose, California and the campus
is bound by Falls Creek Drive to the north, San Felipe Road to the west, and Yerba Buena Road to the east
and south.

The Educational and Facilities Master Plan Update ­ 2025 (June 22, 2010) is a comprehensive plan
highlighting the future educational and facility needs of the College. The plan projects an annual student
population growth rate of 1.84 percent through 2025, resulting in an increase in the student population of
approximately 2,863 students over the life of the plan. To accommodate the projected growth, the Project
includes construction of a new Arts Complex and Physical Education expansion, in conjunction with other
facilities, totaling 42,800 square-feet.

PROJECT STUDY AREA
The analysis was conducted to identify potential Project impacts to the transportation system and identifies
improvements to mitigate any significant impacts. Figure 1 presents the Project location, surrounding
roadway system, study intersections, and freeway study segments. The proposed Evergreen Valley College
Facilities Master Plan is shown on Figure 2.

Study Intersections

Project impacts were evaluated following the guidelines of the City of San Jose, the Santa Clara Valley
Transportation Authority (VTA), which is the congestion management agency for Santa Clara County, and the
California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). The analysis evaluated the operations of the following key
intersections which were selected based on the amount of new traffic that could be added to the intersection
by the proposed Project:

        1.       U.S. 101 SB Off-ramp/Yerba Buena Road*
        2.       U.S. 101 NB Off-ramp/Yerba Buena Road*
        3.       Silver Creek Road/Yerba Buena Road
        4.       Nieman Boulevard/Silver Creek Valley Road/Yerba Buena Road
        5.       Byington Drive/Yerba Buena Avenue/Yerba Buena Road
        6.       San Felipe Road/Yerba Buena Road
        7.       Paseo de Arboles/San Felipe Road
        8.       Delta Road/San Felipe Road
        9.       Fowler Road/San Felipe Road
        10.      San Felipe Road/Yerba Buena Avenue
        11.      Aborn Road/White Road/San Felipe Road
        12.      Aborn Road/Nieman Boulevard
        13.      East Capitol Expressway/Aborn Road*
        14.      East Capitol Expressway/Silver Creek Road*

        * Designated CMP intersection.




                                                                                                            1

Freeway Segments

The analysis also evaluated the operations of the following key freeway segments:

             1. US 101, between Silver Creek Valley Road and Hellyer Avenue
             2. US 101, between Hellyer Avenue and Yerba Buena Road
             3. US 101, between Yerba Buena Road and East Capitol Expressway
             4. US 101, between East Capitol Expressway and Tully Road
Freeway segments were evaluated under Existing and Existing Plus Project Conditions following VTA and
Caltrans guidelines.

INTERSECTION ANALYSIS SCENARIOS
The operations of the key intersections were evaluated during the weekday morning (AM) and afternoon (PM)
peak hours for the following four scenarios:

        Scenario 1:       Existing Conditions ­ Existing volumes obtained from counts.

        Scenario 2:       Existing Plus Project Conditions ­ Scenario 1 volumes plus traffic generated by the
                          proposed Facilities Master Plan.

        Scenario 3:       Cumulative No Project Conditions ­ Existing volumes (Scenario 1) plus traffic from
                          approved but not yet constructed and pending developments in the area.

        Scenario 4:       Cumulative Plus Project Conditions ­ Scenario 3 volumes plus traffic generated by
                          the proposed Facilities Master Plan.

TRAFFIC ANALYSIS METHODS
The operations of roadway facilities are described with the term level of service (LOS). LOS is a qualitative
description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six
levels are defined from LOS A, with the best operating conditions, to LOS F, with the worst operating
conditions. LOS E represents "at-capacity" operations. Operations are designated as LOS F when volumes
exceed capacity, resulting in stop-and-go conditions.

The City of San Jose has established a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D for all intersections.
Congestion Management Program (CMP) designated intersections under the jurisdiction of the City will be
held to the LOS D standard. The minimum acceptable level for CMP-monitored intersections not under the
City's jurisdiction is LOS E.

Signalized Intersections

The level of service methodology approved by the City of San Jose, VTA, and Caltrans analyzes a signalized
intersection's operation based on average control vehicular delay using the method described in Chapter 16
of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) by the Transportation Research Board, with adjusted saturation
flow rates to reflect Santa Clara County conditions. Control delay includes initial deceleration delay, queue
move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. The average control delay for signalized
intersections is calculated using TRAFFIX analysis software and correlated to a LOS designation as shown in
Table 1.

Freeway Segments

Freeway segments are evaluated using VTA's analysis procedure, which is based on the density of the traffic
flow using methods described in the 2000 HCM. Density is expressed in passenger cars per mile per lane.
The Congestion Management Program range of densities for freeway segment level of service is shown in
Table 2. The LOS standard for the freeway segments is LOS E.

Evergreen Valley College Facilities Transportation Impact Analysis
January 2012


REPORT ORGANIZATION
The remainder of this report is divided into three chapters. The existing transportation system serving the
Project and the current operating conditions of key intersections and freeway segments are described in
Chapter 2. Chapter 3 describes Existing Plus Project Conditions, including the method used to estimate the
amount of traffic added to the surrounding roadways by the proposed Project and their impacts on the
transportation system. A discussion of site access and on-site circulation is contained in Chapter 3.
Cumulative Conditions are described in Chapter 4.

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter describes existing transportation network in the project site vicinity, including roadway facilities,
pedestrian and bicycle facilities, transit service, traffic volumes, and intersection operations.

EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK
This section describes the existing roadway network near the EVC campus, which was previously illustrated
on Figure 1.

Regional Access

Highway 101 (US 101) is a north-south freeway west of the EVC campus extending north to downtown San
Jose and San Francisco, and south towards Gilroy. The freeway provides three mixed-flow lanes and one
carpool lane in each direction near the EVC campus. The carpool lane is open to mixed-flow traffic outside of
the peak periods. The campus is accessible via ramps at Yerba Buena Boulevard.

East Capitol Expressway is a radial arterial roadway northwest of the EVC campus that connects State Route
(SR) 87, US 101 and Interstate (I) 680. The roadway bypasses the SR 87 / I-280 and US 101 / I-680
interchanges to the south. In the vicinity of the EVC campus, East Capitol Expressway has four travel lanes
in each direction.

Local Access

Yerba Buena Road is an east-west, four-lane arterial roadway bordering the southern edge of the EVC
campus. Yerba Buena Road provides the primary connection to US 101 to the west. It also extends to the
northeast where it terminates at Fowler Road.

San Felipe Road is a north-south, four-lane arterial roadway bordering the western edge of the EVC campus.
It connects to Aborn Road to the north. North of Aborn Road, San Felipe Road becomes South White Road.
To the south, the roadway extends beyond the City limit.

Aborn Road is an east-west, two- to six-lane arterial roadway that runs parallel to Yerba Buena Road north of
the EVC campus. Aborn Road provides six lanes between East Capitol Expressway and Mosher Drive, which
is approximately 1.5 miles east of San Felipe Road.

Internal circulation on the EVC campus is facilitated by Paseo de Arboles and Valle del Laeo and within
campus parking lots. There are no roadways that connect the west side to the east side of the campus.

EXISTING PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE FACILITIES

Pedestrian Facilities

Pedestrian facilities are comprised of sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian signals, and off-street paths.
Sidewalks in the study area are generally consistent and continuous along surrounding roadways on both
sides of the street with the exception of the following locations:

    ·   The south side of Yerba Buena Road east of San Felipe Road

    ·   The west side of San Felipe Road is discontinuous in several locations to the north and south of
        Yerba Buena Road




                                                                                                                7
Evergreen Valley College Facilities Transportation Impact Analysis

Separated paths are provided along Paseo de Arboles from the EVC campus to San Felipe Road.
Crosswalks and pedestrian signals are located at the signalized intersections within the study area. Existing
pedestrian facilities are shown on Figure 3.

On-campus pedestrian facilities consist of paths connecting buildings to each other and to parking lots.
Typically these paths on a campus provide for pedestrian connectivity and require bicyclists to walk their
bicycles. All on-campus pedestrian circulation is provided by the use of pedestrian walkways/paths.

Bicycle Facilities

Bicycle facilities include the following:

    ·    Bike paths (Class I) ­ Paved trails that are separated from roadways.

    ·    Bike lanes (Class II) ­ Lanes on roadways designated for use by bicycles through striping, pavement
         legends, and signs.

    ·    Bike routes (Class III) ­ Designated roadways for bicycle use by signs only; may or may not include
         additional pavement width for cyclists.

Figure 3 presents existing bicycle facilities in the study area.

A Class I bicycle path is located along Evergreen Creek. Access to the trail is provided on the north side of
the EVC campus and extends between San Felipe Road and Yerba Buena Road, although partially unpaved.
Class II bicycle lanes are located in both directions on San Felipe Road north of Yerba Buena Road, on Yerba
Buena Road between the EVC campus and Silver Creek Road, and on Aborn Road between East Capitol
Expressway and Ruby Avenue providing key connections to surrounding land uses.

The City of San Jose Bicycle Plan identifies future bike lanes on many local roadways and a Class I bike path
that would run parallel to San Felipe Road.

No bicycle facilities such as bike paths or lanes exist on campus. Typical to other college and university
campuses, bicycle use is prohibited in the center of campus where "bicycles... may not be ridden on campus
sidewalks." 1 Bicycle parking is provided at a variety of locations on the EVC campus via bike racks.

January 2012



EXISTING TRANSIT SERVICE
Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) provides fixed-route bus service on 72 local routes in
Santa Clara County, serving the City of San Jose. VTA also operates light rail service in Santa Clara County.
Figure 4 shows the existing transit facilities in the study area.

VTA bus stops for routes 31 and 39 provide transit service adjacent to EVC. The campus has minimal transit
service.

Route 31 provides service between the Eastridge Transit Center and EVC. Service is provided weekdays
between 6:00 am and 10:30 pm on approximately 30-minute headways. Weekend service is provided on both
Saturday and Sunday between 9:00 am and 5:30 pm on 60-minute headways. Stops include EVC, the Aborn
Road / South White Road intersection, the Silver Creek Road / East Capitol Expressway intersection, and the
Eastridge Transit Center. These stops provide access to Silver Creek High School and Eastridge Shopping
Center.

Route 39 does not provide a direct connection to EVC. A stop is located approximately three-quarters of a
mile south at Hounds Estates / The Villages Parkway intersection. Pedestrian access through the adjacent
neighborhood is provided directly across from Valle del Laeo. Service is provided weekdays between 6:30 am
and 7:30 pm on headways between 30 minutes and 60 minutes. Weekend service is provided on both
Saturday and Sunday between 6:45 am and 7:50 pm on similar headways. Stops include The Villages
development, Ruby Avenue and Evergreen Village, the Quimby Road / Ruby Avenue intersection, and the
Eastridge Transit Center. These stops provide access to the Evergreen Village Square, Evergreen Valley
High School, Quimby Oaks Middle School, and Eastridge Shopping Center.

Ridership information for the two bus routes identified above are presented in Table 3.

EXISTING VOLUMES AND LANE CONFIGURATIONS
Study intersection operations were evaluated during the weekday AM and PM peak hours. Intersection
operations were evaluated for the highest one-hour volume counted between 7:00 and 9:00 AM and between
4:00 and 6:00 PM. Intersection turning movement counts were conducted in September 2011 when classes at
EVC were in session. The traffic counts are included in Appendix A.

Figure 5 presents the existing AM and PM peak-hour turning movement volumes at the study intersections
and the existing intersection lane configurations and traffic control devices.

Existing Intersection Levels of Service

Existing operations were evaluated for the weekday AM and PM peak hours at the study intersections, as
summarized in Table 4, based on the turning movement volumes, lane configurations and traffic control
shown on Figure 5. All study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels of service according to the
standards set forth by the City of San Jose, VTA, and Caltrans, with the potential exception of the East
Capitol Expressway / Aborn Road intersection, which operates at LOS E during the PM peak hour. As this
intersection is a CMP intersection, LOS E is considered acceptable according to the VTA, although
unacceptable under City of San Jose standards. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation sheets.

EXISTING FREEWAY SEGMENT LEVELS OF SERVICE
Freeway segment densities reported in VTA's 2007 Monitoring and Conformance Report were used to
calculate the levels of service for the key freeway segments during the AM and PM peak hours. The results of
the LOS analysis for Existing Conditions are presented in Table 5.

The following segments of mixed-flow lanes are operating at unacceptable levels (LOS F) according to VTA
and Caltrans standards:

      ·   Northbound US 101, between Hellyer Avenue and Yerba Buena Road (AM peak)

      ·   Northbound US 101, between Yerba Buena Road and East Capitol Expressway (AM peak)

      ·   Northbound US 101, between East Capitol Expressway and Tully Road (AM peak)

      ·   Southbound US 101, between Tully Road and East Capitol Expressway (PM peak)

The following segments of high-occupancy lanes are operating at unacceptable levels (LOS F):

      ·   Northbound US 101, between East Capitol Expressway and Tully Road (AM peak)

3. EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
This chapter identifies the potential off-site impacts of the proposed Project. First, the method used to
estimate the amount of traffic generated by the increased number of enrolled students is described. Then, the
results of the level of service calculations for Existing Plus Project Conditions are presented. Existing Plus
Project Conditions are defined as Existing Conditions plus traffic generated by the Project. Existing Plus
Project impacts are then identified by comparing the level of service results under Existing Plus Project
Conditions to those under Existing Conditions. Site access, on-site circulation, parking, and pedestrian,
bicycle, and transit impacts are also addressed in this chapter.

PROJECT TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
The amount of traffic added to the roadway system by the proposed EVC Facilities Master Plan is estimated
using a three-step process:

    1. Trip Generation ­ The amount of vehicle traffic entering and exiting the Project site was estimated,
       taking into consideration travel by walking, biking and busing to the campus.
    2. Trip Distribution ­ The direction trips use to approach and depart the site was projected.
    3. Trip Assignment ­ Trips were then assigned to specific roadway segments and intersection turning
       movements.

This process for the proposed Project is described in the following sections.

Trip Generation

Additional Students

The amount of traffic generated by the additional students was estimated by applying rates derived from
driveway counts of the San Jose City College campus conducted in September 2007. It was assumed that
driver behavior between the two campuses was similar on a per student basis. The rates were derived from
student enrollment at the time of the survey, which was approximately 12,000 students. Trip generation rates
per student were calculated for the AM and PM peak hours, as shown in Table 6. The Project would increase
the student population by approximately 2,863 students, resulting in an approximately 3,980 new daily trips,
315 new AM peak-hour trips (251 inbound and 64 outbound) and 381 new PM peak-hour trips (249 inbound
and 132 outbound).

Comparison of Trip Generation Rates to ITE Rates

The Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation, 8th Edition has trip generation rates of 0.12 trips
per student for both the AM and PM peak hours. These are about 10 percent different than the rates observed
in the surveys of the SJCC campus. However, the rates are based on a limited number of studies (5 trip
generation surveys) and may not reflect a similar environment of the San Jose area. Two of the five studies
identified transit centers within close proximity of the studied campuses. Transit use could affect the trip
generation rates at those locations. The SJCC-specific trip generation rates were used in analyzing the traffic
generation of the new students to reflect a locally validated trip generation rate.

Trip Distribution

The directions of approach and departure for Project traffic were estimated based on the existing travel
patterns in the area and the relative locations of complementary land uses including residential and
commercial uses. In addition, population density data from the 2000 Census Transportation Planning Packet
(CTPP) was used. The major directions of approach and departure from the trip distribution pattern for the
project, and are illustrated on Figure 6. The trip distribution is generally consistent with the analysis presented
in the EVC Facilities Master Plan EIR, May 2001.

Trip Assignment

The trips generated by the Project were assigned to the roadway system based on the directions of approach
and departure discussed above. Figure 7 shows the AM and PM peak-hour project trips assigned to each
turning movement at the study intersections. Project trips were added to Existing Conditions traffic volumes to
establish intersection volumes for Existing Plus Project Conditions, as shown on Figure 8.

EXISTING PLUS PROJECT INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Level of service calculations were conducted to evaluate intersection operations under Existing Plus Project
Conditions. The results of the LOS analysis are summarized in Table 7. The changes in overall intersection
delay due to the addition of project traffic are also shown in this table. In a few instances, slight improvements
in delay are reported. This is due to the methodology the program uses to allocate green time to the various
turning movements based on changes in the traffic volumes on individual approaches.

The results for Existing Conditions are included for comparison purposes, along with the projected increases
in critical delay and critical volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios for intersections that would operate unacceptably.
Critical delay represents the delay associated with the critical movements of the intersection, or the
movements that require the most "green time" and have the greatest effect on overall intersection operations.
The changes in critical delay and critical V/C ratio between Existing and Existing Plus Project Conditions are
used to identify significant impacts.

All intersections continue to operate acceptably in both peak periods under City of San Jose, VTA, and
Caltrans standards except for the East Capitol Expressway / Aborn Road intersection, which operates at
LOS E in the PM peak hour with or without the project.

INTERSECTION IMPACT CRITERIA
The impacts of the project were evaluated by comparing the results of the level of service calculations under
Existing Plus Project Conditions to the results under Existing Conditions.

City of San Jose

Significant impacts at signalized San Jose intersections occur when project traffic causes one of the following:

     ·   Operations degrade from an acceptable level (LOS D or better) under Existing Conditions to an
         unacceptable level (LOS E or F) under Existing Plus Project Conditions.

     ·   Unacceptable operations (LOS E or F) are exacerbated by increasing the critical delay by more than
         4 seconds and increasing the volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio by 0.01 or more.

     ·   The V/C ratio increases by 0.01 or more at an intersection with unacceptable operations (LOS E or F)
         when the change in critical delay is negative (i.e., decreases). This can occur if the critical
         movements change.




                                                                                                                                     22

Valley Transportation Authority

Significant impacts at CMP intersections occur when project traffic causes one of the following:

    ·   Operations degrade from an acceptable level (LOS E or better) under Existing Conditions to an
        unacceptable level (LOS F) under Existing Plus Project Conditions.

    ·   LOS F operations are exacerbated by increasing the critical delay by more than 4 seconds and
        increasing the volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio by 0.01 or more.

    ·   The V/C ratio increases by 0.01 or more at an intersection with LOS F operations when the change in
        critical delay is negative (i.e., decreases). This can occur if the critical movements change.

INTERSECTION IMPACTS
East Capitol Expressway & Aborn Road

During the PM peak hour, the East Capitol Expressway / Aborn Road intersection operates at an
unacceptable LOS E under Existing. The addition of traffic from the proposed Project does not increase the
critical movement V/C ratio, and intersection delay remains unchanged, this is not a significant impact under
the City of San Jose significance standards. Under VTA criteria, the intersection operates at an acceptable
service level without and with the Project. Therefore, the Project impact to this intersection is considered
less-than-significant.

EXISTING PLUS PROJECT FREEWAY SEGMENT LEVELS OF SERVICE
CMP guidelines require that freeway segments to which a proposed development is projected to add trips
equal to or greater than one percent of the freeway segment's capacity must be evaluated. Segments of US
101 were reviewed to determine if a significant amount of project traffic would be added to its freeway
segments.

Capacities of 2,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for freeway segments with six or more lanes were used
in the freeway analysis. A capacity of 1,800 vphpl was used for high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. For this
analysis, it was assumed that the project trips using HOV lanes would be similar in proportion to existing use
of HOV lanes. Table 8 presents the capacities of each freeway segment and the estimated number of trips
added to each segment by the proposed project.

Existing Plus Project Conditions to the results under Existing Conditions. Significant impacts to freeway
segments occur when the addition of project traffic causes one of the following:

        ·     A segment drops below its acceptable CMP operating standard (LOS E)

        ·     Unacceptable operations (LOS F) are exacerbated by adding traffic equal to more than one percent
              of a segment's capacity

Based on the impact criteria listed above, the proposed project would have a less-than-significant impact on
all freeway segments.

PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE, AND TRANSIT FACILITY IMPACTS
The Project would cause a significant impact to pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities and services if one of
the following occurs:



                                                                                                                                 24

    ·   An element of the proposed Project conflicts with existing or planned pedestrian, bicycle, and transit
        facilities.

    ·   The proposed Project creates hazardous conditions for pedestrians or bicyclists that currently do not
        exist.

The project may generate additional demand for pedestrian facilities. Existing sidewalks are provided
adjacent to and in the vicinity of the site. Sidewalks and pedestrian connections link the EVC campus to
adjacent neighborhoods and transit facilities. The existing pedestrian facilities are expected to accommodate
the increased demand. The proposed project does not conflict with any existing or proposed pedestrian
facilities and the proposed project does not create hazardous conditions for pedestrians. Therefore, a less-
than-significant impact is expected for pedestrian facilities.

The project may generate additional demand for bicycle facilities. The proposed project does not conflict with
any existing or proposed facilities and the proposed project does not create hazardous conditions for
bicyclists. Therefore, a less-than-significant impact is expected for bicycle facilities.

The project may generate additional demand for transit service. The Evergreen campus is served by two bus
routes. Approximately four buses serve EVC during each peak hour. The existing transit service is expected
to accommodate the possible increased demand and the proposed project does not conflict with any existing
or proposed transit facilities. Therefore, a less-than-significant impact is anticipated for transit service.

SITE ACCESS AND ON-SITE CIRCULATION

Site Access

The EVC campus can currently be accessed from locations along San Felipe Road and Yerba Buena Road.
Site access is considered adequate for the volume of traffic generated by the site. Paseo de Arboles would be
maintained as the primary access to San Felipe Road and would continue to be controlled by a signalized
intersection at San Felipe Road. Valle del Laeo, which currently provides access to Yerba Buena Road, will
be converted to a pedestrian pathway. However, several new vehicular access points would be constructed
along Yerba Buena Road. The access points would have little conflicting traffic and would be stop-controlled
intersections. Based on the trip generation estimates, forecasted demand would be adequately served by
these access points. Driveway spacing and sight distance at the new driveways would be adequate.

On-Site Circulation

On-site circulation would be provided by internal roadways and driveways. These facilities would connect the
various parking lots to each other. While a connection is currently provided around the perimeter of the
campus, it is not designed as a formal roadway. The Facilities Master Plan identifies a loop road that
connects Paseo de Arboles and the west side of the campus to the new access on the east side of campus.
The inner core of campus would provide a series of interconnected pedestrian pathways, including a central
pedestrian promenade that connects the west plaza and east plaza.

Generally, bicycles are not allowed to be ridden through the campus core. The site plan shows ample bicycle
parking along the periphery of the campus core adjacent to campus buildings.

PARKING

Parking Demand Due to 2,863 New Students

The existing parking facilities on the EVC campus consist of several paved surface lots. The parking facilities
are designated for specific users (student, staff, etc.).




                                                                                                            25
Evergreen Valley College Facilities Transportation Impact Analysis

Based on the parking study performed for the EVC Facilities Master Plan in 2001, an acceptable parking
supply for the community college is between 4 and 5 students per parking space. The existing supply is
approximately 4.7 students per parking space. According to EVC staff, the campus is adequately parked for
the current enrollment. Due to construction of new buildings in the Facilities Master Plan, approximately 130
existing parking spaces would be removed (according to the Overlay of 2025 Facilities Master Plan on
Existing Conditions by HMC Architects dated August 8, 2011). However, during Phase III of the Facilities
Master Plan, the campus would build a 1,700 space parking structure. This is a net new increase of
approximately 1,570. This provides a parking space for every two additional students, which will provide
additional spaces beyond the growth anticipated by the college. This additional parking would support special
event parking demand and other non-recurring demands. Parking demand is largely dependent upon
enrollment, class schedule, and parking costs. It is not expected that the additional parking would induce
demand beyond forecasted enrollment levels.

The proposed Project would result in a potentially significant impact if a construction management and
phasing plan is not developed to ensure adequate parking is provided throughout the implementation of the
facilities master plan.

Mitigation Measure: Develop a Construction Management Plan and Project Phasing.

With implementation of this mitigation measure, adequate parking for levels of enrollment during different
phases of construction can be secured. Temporary parking or travel demand management may be
acceptable tools used to manage parking demands. With the execution of this mitigation measure, the impact
to parking would be reduced to a less-than-significant impact.

4. CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS
This chapter presents an analysis of Cumulative Conditions without and with the proposed Project.
Cumulative No Project Conditions are defined as existing volumes plus traffic generated by approved but not
yet constructed developments in the project study area, plus traffic generated by pending developments. Trips
from the proposed Project (described in Chapter 3) are added to the Cumulative No Project Conditions to
obtain Cumulative plus Project Conditions. This chapter describes the procedure used to determine the
cumulative traffic volumes and the results of the level of service analysis for Cumulative Conditions. No
freeway segments analysis was performed because VTA guidelines do not require an analysis of freeway
operations under Cumulative Conditions. Project contributions to freeway segments under existing conditions
were under one percent of segment capacity for both the mixed flow and HOV lanes.

CUMULATIVE TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
Traffic volumes for Cumulative Conditions were estimated by adding traffic generated by approved and
pending developments to existing traffic volumes. San Jose City staff provided an approved trip inventory
(ATI) that accounts for projects that would potentially add traffic to the study intersections. The ATI is included
in Appendix C. Traffic associated with pending projects, obtained from the City of San Jose were also was
included. Figure 9 illustrates the traffic volumes at the key intersections under Cumulative No Project
Conditions. The trips generated by the proposed project were added to the Cumulative No Project Condition
volumes and are shown on Figure 10.

CUMULATIVE ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
No roadway improvements were identified for inclusion under Cumulative Conditions.

CUMULATIVE INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Level-of-service calculations were conducted for the study intersections to evaluate their operations under
Cumulative No Project and Cumulative Plus Project Conditions. The results of the LOS analysis are
presented in Table 9. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation sheets.

PROJECT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

US 101 SB Off-Ramp & Yerba Buena Road

The proposed Project would result in a significant impact at the US 101 SB Off-Ramp / Yerba Buena Road
signalized intersection in the cumulative condition. This intersection operates at an unacceptable LOS F
under both the AM and PM peak hour conditions without the addition of project related trips. Project related
increases would satisfy either the V/C or vehicle delay thresholds.

The US 101 SB Off-Ramp / Yerba Buena Road signalized intersection is physically constrained. To improve
operating conditions to an acceptable level, widening of the intersection to provide additional capacity would
be required. Substantial improvement could only be accomplished through extensive demolition and
reconstruction of facilities and/or right-of-way acquisition; therefore, the measure was not further considered.
Additionally, this intersection is a Caltrans facility and even if there were not physical constraints, ,
implementation of improvements cannot be guaranteed by the City. Traffic impacts at this intersection under
the Cumulative Plus Project conditions would remain significant and unavoidable.

San Felipe Road & Yerba Buena Road

The proposed Project would result in significant impact at the San Felipe Road / Yerba Buena Road
signalized intersection in the cumulative condition. This intersection operates at an unacceptable LOS E
under both the AM and PM peak hour conditions without the addition of project related trips. Project related
increases would satisfy either the V/C or vehicle delay thresholds.

Mitigation Measure: Construct a second eastbound left-turn.

With implementation of this mitigation measure, operations at this intersection would improve to an
acceptable LOS D in both the AM and PM peak hours. Installation of the second eastbound left-turn lane
would require reconstruction of the center median and restriping of the eastbound lanes, but should not
require additional right-of-way. Construction of the mitigation measure shall be the responsibility of the City.
With the installation of this mitigation measure, the traffic impact at the San Felipe Road / Yerba Buena Road
intersection would be reduced to a less-than-significant impact.

Aborn Road & White Road / San Felipe Road

The proposed Project would result in significant impact at the Aborn Road & White Road / San Felipe Road
signalized intersection in the cumulative condition. This intersection operates at an unacceptable LOS E
under the PM peak hour conditions without the addition of project related trips and the addition of Project trips
would increase the V/C or vehicle delay thresholds beyond acceptable limits. Additionally, Project related
trips worsen acceptable LOS D to unacceptable LOS E conditions during the AM peak hour.

Mitigation Measure: Construct a second westbound left-turn.

With implementation of this mitigation measure, operations at this intersection would improve to an
acceptable LOS D during the AM peak hour. The PM peak hour would continue to operate at LOS E;
however, delay and V/C would no longer trigger the threshold of significance. Installation of the second
westbound left-turn lane would require restriping of the center median and would not require additional right-
of-way. Construction of the mitigation measure shall be the responsibility of the City. With the installation of
this mitigation measure, the traffic impact at the Aborn Road & White Road / San Felipe Road intersection
would be reduced to a less-than-significant impact.

East Capitol Expressway & Aborn Road

The East Capitol Expressway / Aborn Road intersection operates at an unacceptable LOS F under
Cumulative No Project and Cumulative Plus Project Conditions during the AM and PM peak hour. The



                                                                                                              29

increase in critical V/C and delay does not exceed the one percent and four second threshold, respectively.
Therefore, the impact to this intersection would be considered less-than-significant.

East Capitol Expressway & Silver Creek Road

The East Capitol Expressway / Silver Creek Road intersection operates at an unacceptable LOS E under
Cumulative No Project and Cumulative Plus Project Conditions during the AM peak hour. The increase in
critical V/C and delay does not exceed the one percent and four second threshold, respectively. Therefore,

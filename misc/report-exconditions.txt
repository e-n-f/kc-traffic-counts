CHAPTER 1 ­ INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE OF STUDY

1.1    Introduction

The Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) Southwest Region contracted with
Oneida Total Integrated Enterprises (OTIE) to conduct a study to develop a long-range plan for
the US 14 corridor from WIS 92 to I-39/90 in Dane and Rock Counties. The plan involves
reviewing the existing conditions on the corridor, identifying deficiencies and needs, and
developing a long range plan for the corridor.

1.3    Study Limits

The study limits extend along US 14 from the WIS 92/US 14 intersection in Dane County to the
I-39/90 interchange in Janesville, Rock County, a distance of approximately 22.5 miles. The
corridor connects Evansville, Janesville, and Brooklyn. A map of the study area is shown in
Figure 1.1.

1.4    Purpose of Study

The purpose of this study is to develop a long-range plan (Corridor Management Plan) to
evaluate access and operational and safety needs along the corridor. This will allow for WisDOT
and local officials to adequately plan for future land use and transportation needs. The study will
include possible improvement alternatives and strategies related to safety and mobility which
will allow US 14 to operate efficiently well into the future, while maintaining the current 2-lane
facility.

As traffic increases and additional nearby land is developed along such highways, events around
the state have shown that unmanaged and unprotected highways can deteriorate quickly in the
form of reduced safety and operational efficiency. In addition, development can increase the cost
for new right-of-way and reduce alternatives for necessary road improvements.

1.5    Study Process

The study process will be completed in two phases; the first phase will gather data on the
existing corridor, and will culminate in an Existing Conditions Report. The second phase will
analyze improvement strategies for the corridor, and will result in a Corridor Management Plan.

The data gathering phase will collect information about the existing US 14, including traffic
volumes; crash rates; geometric deficiencies; number and location of access points; existing and
future land use; wetlands and floodplains; potential archaeological and historical sites; potential
hazardous materials sites; and railroad facilities. This phase of the study will also include agency
coordination and public involvement. The results of the data gathering phase will be summarized
in the Existing Conditions Report.

Possible strategies for improving safety and mobility on the corridor will be developed based on
the results of the Existing Conditions Report. These strategies could include geometric
improvements, intersection improvements, access improvements or modifications, passing lanes,
side road access modifications, or other improvements. The study will conclude with a Corridor
Management Plan. The final plan will provide possible alternatives for improvements, and
identify thresholds for when these improvements might be implemented.

CHAPTER 2 ­ EXISTING CONDITIONS

2.1    Transportation Facilities

US 14 Corridor
US 14 is a principal arterial highway that serves south central Wisconsin and is a major link
between the Madison area, LaCrosse, Janesville, and northern Illinois. It provides access to
recreational and tourist destinations as well as many farming communities. It is also used by
commuters to access employment destinations in Madison and Janesville.

US 14 is identified as a Connector Route in WisDOT's Connections 2030 plan, reiterating its
importance in serving regional travel needs. Connector routes are a series of high quality two and
four-lane roadways that connect the state's economic and population centers to each other and to
3/11/2011                                                                               Page 6 of 58

the backbone routes. Connector routes are expected to carry long-distance, statewide and inter-
state traffic.




Figure 2.1: Connections 2030 Map

US 14 is part of the National Highway System (NHS), which includes over 160,000 miles of
highways across the nation. The NHS includes interstate highways, principal arterial highways,
strategic highways and intermodal connectors. These roads are important to the nation's
economy, defense and mobility.

The US 14 corridor between Brooklyn and Janesville is predominantly a rural two-lane highway.
The typical cross section for this area of US 14 consists of two 12-foot lanes with 6-foot to 8-foot
shoulders (3-foot paved). Through Evansville, US 14 becomes a two-lane urban section with
curb and gutter and sidewalk. The typical cross section for this section is two 12-foot lanes with
4-foot paved shoulders and 2.5-foot curb and gutter. At County M to US 51, east of Evansville,
US 14 returns to a rural two-lane highway. There is a 12-foot wide truck climbing lane located in
this section east of the Rock River in the eastbound direction. US 14 becomes a four-lane divided
roadway between US 51 and I-39/90, including median separation and designated turn lanes at
intersections.

Many intersections throughout the rural areas lack right turn lanes and bypass lanes to
accommodate turning vehicles. Bypass lanes are paved lanes that allow through traffic to bypass
vehicles waiting to make a left turn at a Tee intersection. Right turn lanes provide a deceleration
area for vehicles making a right turn, allowing through traffic to maintain speed.

3/11/2011                                                                               Page 7 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange


The eastbound lane of rural US 14 has 5 right turn lanes and two bypass lanes. The right turn
lanes are located at WIS 92, WIS 59/213, Weary Road, County H and Leith Road. The bypass
lanes are located at WIS 59 and Bullard Road. There is also a truck climbing lane in the
eastbound direction that begins at N River Road and ends at Edgewood Drive.

The westbound lane of rural US 14 has 8 right turn lanes and two bypass lanes. The right turn
lanes are located at WIS 92, WIS 59, Bullard Road, J Lindemann Drive, Weary Road, County H,
N River Road and Juniper Ridge Court. The bypass lanes are located at WIS 59/213 and Leith
Road.

In the urban section of US 14, east of US 51, most of the intersections have right and left turn
lanes. Bell Street does not have right turn lanes in the eastbound or west bound direction, and
Kennedy Road does not have a right turn lane in the westbound direction. Many of the
commercial driveways in this section also have right and left turn lanes.

There are eight signalized intersections within the US 14 corridor, seven of them in Janesville
and one in Evansville. They are located at County M, US 51, Kennedy Road, Bell Street,
WIS 26, Lexington Drive, Pontiac Drive and at I-39/90.

Corridor Speed Limits
Posted speed limits within the corridor vary between 25 mph and 55 mph. The following sections
have speed limits below 55 mph.
       1. From Elmer Road to the north Evansville city limits, the speed limit starts at 45 mph
          then decreases to 35 mph.
       2. From the north Evansville city limits to County M, the speed limit is 25 mph.
       3. From County M to J Lindemann Drive, the speed limit is 45 mph.
       4. From Edgewood Drive/Juniper Ridge Court to US 51, the speed limit is 45 mph.
       5. From Newville Road to Kennedy Road, the speed limit is 50 mph.
       6. From Kennedy Road to I-39/90, the speed limit is 40 mph.
Access
Wisconsin State Statute 84.25 gives WisDOT the authority to control access by freezing access
along the corridor. Access control is generally completed following a roadway construction
project. Once Statute 84.25 is complete, any future projects cannot remove any access without
owners' consent. The addition of new access along the corridor is restricted.

Access control was completed on the US 14 corridor in Dane and Rock Counties, but has yet to
be completed in Evansville (Figure 2.2, Existing 84.25 Administrative Access Control).




3/11/2011                                                                               Page 8 of 58

Figure 2.2: Existing 84.25 Administrative Access Control

In the 23-mile stretch of US 14, there are over 346 at-grade access points, of which 48 are
intersections and 298 are commercial and residential driveways. Table 2.1 summarizes the type
and frequency of access points along the US 14 corridor.

Parking
Parking is not permitted along the US 14 corridor.

Park and Ride Lots
There are currently no park and ride facilities located within the study area. However, the 1999
WisDOT D1 Park and Ride System Plan identifies two locations in Janesville for potential future
park and ride lots. One of these locations is along the west side of WIS 26, just north of US 14.

Snowmobile Crossing
There are numerous snowmobile trails located within the US 14 corridor; none of the trails are
marked or signed. Specific trail crossings are located as follows:
3/11/2011                                                                             Page 9 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange


       1. Dane county trail 39 crosses US 14 north of WIS 92.
       2. The corridor 40 trail crosses US 14 south of Union Road and north of Butts Corners
          Road.
       3. The corridor 40 trail crosses US 14 at the intersection with County M.
       4. The corridor 40 trail crosses US 14 at the intersection of Tolles Road.
       5. The corridor 15 trail crosses US 14 at the intersection of County H.
       6. The corridor 15 trail crosses US 14 west of County E, and again at the intersection of
          US 14 and County E.
       7. The corridor 15 trail uses the US 14 bridge over the Rock River.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
There is minimal pedestrian traffic throughout a majority of the corridor due to the rural nature
of the area. The exception is the urbanized area of Evansville. Sidewalks are located in
Evansville between WIS 59/213 and J Lindemann Drive. Sidewalk begins 300 yards north of
WIS 59/213 on the west side of US 14, and ends at J Lindemann Drive on the north side of
US 14. Sidewalk on both sides of US 14 begins 500 feet north of the Union Road/Main Street
intersection, and ends at County M.

Evansville has curb and gutter from Madison Street to J Lindemann Drive. There are marked
pedestrian crosswalks along US 14 at Madison Street, Union Road/Main Street, Jackson Street,
Cemetery Road, Countryside Drive, Water Street and County M. Included at the marked
pedestrian crosswalks are curb ramps and yellow detectable warning fields. The intersection of
US 14/J Lindemann Drive has curb ramps, but no detectable warning field or marked pedestrian
crosswalk.

There is no sidewalk along US 14 in Janesville. However, several side streets that intersect US
14 have pedestrian facilities:
       There is sidewalk along both sides of WIS 26 north and south of US 14; there are marked
       pedestrian crossings and curb ramps at the US 14/WIS 26 intersection.
       There is sidewalk along the east side of Lexington Drive, south of US 14, including a
       curb ramp at the intersection with US 14; however, there is no marked crosswalk at the
       intersection.
       There is sidewalk along both sides of Pontiac Drive south of US 14, including curb ramps
       at the US 14 intersection; however, there is no marked crosswalk at the intersection.

None of the Janesville curb ramps have a detectable warning field. The corridor has pedestrian
signals at the intersections of US 14/WIS 26 and the US 14/County M intersection. Pedestrian
crossing related signing is absent throughout the corridor.

US 14 is not designated as a bike route according to the Wisconsin State Bike Map and the
Bicycle Federation of Wisconsin, due to undesirable conditions and high traffic volume.
According to the Rock County Bike Route & Trails map, there are many bike trails located
within the US 14 corridor, including trail crossings at the following locations:
       1. Holt Road
       2. Along US 14, WIS 59/213 to Main Street (Sidewalk Route)
       3. Along US 14, Union Road to Cemetery Road (Sidewalk Route)

3/11/2011                                                                             Page 10 of 58

       8. Eagle Road/Roherty Road
       9. Along US 14, Hackbarth Road to N River Road(Across Rock River)
       10. Kennedy Road (Kennedy Road Trail)

Another important trail in the vicinity of US 14 is the Ice Age Trail. It is a multi-use path that
circles the City of Janesville, and continues northeast to Milton. Future expansion of the trail
includes a path along US 14 from US 51 to Kennedy Road. There is also a proposed corridor
study of the Ice Age Trail that would include US 14 west of US 51 towards Evansville.

Additional future trail expansions around the corridor include a crossing north of Evansville in
the area of Lake Leota, and a crossing at County M in Evansville.

Railroads
The Union Pacific Railroad and the Wisconsin & Southern Railroad (WSOR) both operate tracks
in the corridor. The Union Pacific (UP) Railroad line extends across Evansville. This line is
abandoned north of the city limits, but crosses WIS 59/213 within the city, near the intersection
with US 14. Within the city and to the southeast, this rail corridor is an active freight line. This
line is crucial to Nelson Young Lumber, Southern Wisconsin Grain and to Evansville's long-
term industrial growth. Union Pacific also operates a small spur line with an at-grade crossing
just east of Newville Road near the City of Janesville.

WSOR is considered a Class II operator, and its tracks provide freight linkages for rural and
urban communities throughout southern Wisconsin. WSOR operates a track with an at-grade
crossing through the middle of the intersection of US 14/Kennedy Road. Because of the
configuration of the intersection, there are eight crossing gates at this location. All the at-grade
rail crossings in the corridor have appropriate signing and pavement marking.

Currently passenger rail service does not exist within the US 14 corridor. In 2006 various state,
county, and municipal officials in south central Wisconsin initiated the South Central Wisconsin
Commuter Transportation Study (SCWCTS). This study was completed in 2008, and included
recommendations for commuter rail lines and station locations. Several of these lines pass
through the study area, and several stations are located in the study area:
       Janesville-Harvard, IL line
           o No stations along study corridor
       Janesville-Rockford line
           o No stations along study corridor
       Madison-Milton-Janesville line
           o Station near US 14/Kennedy Road
       Madison-Evansville-Janesville line
           o Station near Main Street in Evansville

Mass Transit
The City of Janesville is the only community along the corridor that operates its own transit
system. Janesville Transit System (JTS) offers regular bus service Monday through Saturday on
six routes. Part of this service is the Beloit-Janesville Express that operates weekdays between
the two cities. The route travels north from Beloit along US 51 until it intersects US 14, where it
ends and turns around at WIS 26.

The Van Galder Bus Company operates an interstate bus line between Madison and Chicago that
makes a stop in Janesville. There are two routes departing Janesville, one with a destination of
O'Hare Airport, and one that goes to the Amtrak station in downtown Chicago and Midway
Airport. Buses are arriving at and departing the Janesville location for Madison and Illinois
beginning early in the morning and continuing throughout the day.

The Rock County Council on Aging provides specialized transit services that are designed for
use by elderly or disabled persons. To be eligible, an individual must be at least 55 years of age,
or physically disabled. Rides are available to all areas within Rock County on vans equipped
with wheelchair lifts.

On weekdays, the state operates a commuter van from Evansville to Madison. The van is used by
state employees, but non-state employees are also welcome. The van picks up people near the
city parking lot on Montgomery Street. There are no other forms of mass transit available in
Evansville, although residents have expressed an interest in the past.

2.2     Summary of Local Land Use and Transportation Planning Activity

In order to better understand local community impacts resulting from proposed improvements to
US 14, the Study Team surveyed local land use plans and trends. This overview will be used
later in the study as the foundation for a more detailed analysis of the US 14 project's interaction
with projected local community development. The following table lists local community
comprehensive plans and related plans compiled and reviewed to date.

Dane County Comprehensive Plan
The northernmost portion of the US 14 corridor study area lies within Dane County, just north of
the Dane-Rock county line (Figure 2.3, Dane County Map). This section of US 14 is located in
Rutland. Over the past several years, Dane County has added more new residents each year than
any other county in Wisconsin.

    Land Use
    The lands surrounding this portion of the corridor are generally rural with large contiguous
    areas of agricultural uses and scattered residential parcels (Map A.1, Appendix A).


3/11/2011                                                                               Page 13 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange


   The Dane County Comprehensive Plan's Planned Land Use Map (Map B.1, Appendix B)
   depicts a continuation of agricultural uses in this area of the corridor, similar to the Rutland
   Future Land Use Plan. The map also identifies areas of rural development around Brooklyn
   to the west of US 14.

   Transportation
   US 14 is one of the radial arterials that connect to the Madison beltline and interstate route
   system in central Dane County.

   The Dane County Comprehensive Plan does not include a Future Transportation Map (see
   Map C.1, Appendix C for Dane County highway function classifications). However, the Plan
   indicates that the County supports the following transportation policies and programs:
            Incorporating bikeway, transit and other facilities as a part of major street and
            roadway improvement projects.
            Designing highway shoulders and crossings to accommodate farm equipment,
            bicycles and other uses and minimize safety conflicts with automobile traffic.
            Including transportation of agricultural goods to market in all long-term planning
            related to truck freight transport.
            Continuing official mapping and other programs to preserve corridors for possible
            future travel uses.
            Using street and roadway access control measures as a means of preserving travel
            capacity on existing streets and roadways, and of seeking safe and appropriate
            driveway access points.
            Continuing transportation system measures, to make the most efficient use of the
            existing transportation system.

Dane County Park & Open Space Plan
The 2006 Dane County Parks & Open Space Plan identifies countywide recreation needs and
cultural, historical, and natural resources that should be considered for possible protection,
preservation or restoration over the five year planning period (Map D.1, Appendix D). The plan
does not include recommended projects or activities within the US 14 corridor study area.

Village of Oregon Comprehensive Plan
The Village of Oregon is located in southern Dane County (Figure 2.3, Dane County Map). US
14 is located along the eastern edge of the village.

   Land Use
   Development has been primarily dictated by major transportation corridors and land use
   features, namely old US 14, now North Main and Janesville Streets, and the environmental
   corridor that runs northwest to southeast through the village (Map A.2, Appendix A). The
   village has been expanding to the south, southwest, and west over the past 25 years.
   Commercial development is focused to the north along County MM, in the downtown area,
   and along Janesville Street near the US 14/WIS 138 interchange.

   The Village of Oregon's Planned Land Use Map (Map B.2, Appendix B) identifies two
   economic development areas near the US 14 corridor. Mixed use and office development is
   proposed at the US 14/WIS 138 interchange with a large area of industrial development
   immediately to the north. The map also depicts an expansion of the existing northern
   industrial development to the west with smaller areas of future development at the edges.

   Transportation
   US 14, WIS 138, and County MM are major roads serving the village. There is an inactive
   rail line that runs north-south through the Village between Evansville and Madison.

   The Transportation Plan Map for the village (Map C.2, Appendix C) depicts a new major
   north-south arterial road, with 110-foot wide right-of-way or wider, through a future non-
   residential development along the east side of US 14 extending from Rutland-Dunn Town
   Line Road to County A. The map also depicts a conceptual local road network that would
   serve future development in the northern industrial/office area.

Village of Brooklyn
The Village of Brooklyn is located at the convergence of Dane, Rock and Green Counties just
east of the US 14 corridor (Figure 2.3, Dane County Map and Figure 2.4, Rock County Map).
While US 14 does not travel through the village, it is nearby. Located just 12 miles south of
Madison, the village is closely connected with the metropolitan area, yet maintains a small-town
feeling that the community values.

   Land Use
   The village has an expansive municipal boundary area, with nearly 46 percent of it currently
   used for agricultural/rural purposes (Map A.3, Appendix A). Within the developed portions
   of the Village, the most predominant land use is single family residential. Non-residential
   development is focused along Hotel, Railroad, Market, and Commercial Streets.

   The Village of Brooklyn Planned Land Use Map (Map B.3, Appendix B) identifies areas for
   new residential development mainly on the west side of the village. The map also shows a
   proposed 55-acre business park at the southeast edge of the village that has convenient access
   to US 14, WIS 92, and north to the Madison area. This site also takes advantage of rail
   access. There is a conceptual road that would link WIS 92 and WIS 104 to the south,
   allowing truck traffic to bypass the central part of the village.

3/11/2011                                                                           Page 17 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange



   Transportation
   Located about 2 miles east of the village, US 14 is the key principal arterial servicing
   Brooklyn; WIS 92 and County MM are other major roads serving the village. The former
   Chicago & Northwestern Railroad Company line runs northwest through the village, but the
   spurs have been removed. The abandoned rail line is currently owned under a joint venture
   between the City of Fitchburg and Village of Oregon.

   The Village of Brooklyn Comprehensive Plan does not include a Future Transportation Map;
   it does however identify new conceptual local roads that would service future development,
   particularly within the proposed business park.

Town of Rutland Comprehensive Plan
The Town of Rutland is located in south central Dane County (Figure 2.3, Dane County Map).
US 14 is located along the western edge of the town. The town wishes to promote managed
growth that is consistent with its rural character.

   Land Use
   As of 2003, agricultural and woodlands comprise 80 percent of the existing land use
   (Map A.4, Appendix A). Residential land use covers 4 percent of the town and is scattered
   along town roads. Small commercial and industrial land use
   is mostly located along US 14. Park and recreational lands cover 11 percent of the town (e.g.
   Badfish Creek Wildlife Area, Anthony Branch Fishery Area, US Fish and Wildlife Service
   land, and other smaller areas in the northeast quadrant of the town).

   The Town of Rutland Future Land Use Map (Map B.4, Appendix B) depicts the majority of
   remaining undeveloped land as agricultural preservation areas. Future commercial and
   medium-density (1 acre lots) residential development areas are planned near Oregon and
   Brooklyn near the US 14 corridor, with development proposed in phases. A small area of
   commercial and medium-density residential development is also proposed in the northeastern
   part of the town adjacent to existing development near Stoughton. A small area of
   commercial development is also planned at the intersection of US 14 and WIS 92.

   Transportation
   US 14, WIS 138, County MM, and County A are major roads serving the town. There are no
   railroad lines. The only major improvement shown on the Town of Rutland Future
   Transportation Map (Map C.3, Appendix C) is a proposed realignment of US 14. The Town
   of Rutland Future Bicycle Map (Map C.4, Appendix C) identifies County A, Old Stone
   Road, Center Road, and segments of Flint, Oak Hill and Sunrise Roads as bike routes.

Rock County Comprehensive Plan
The vast majority of the US 14 corridor study area lies in northwest Rock County (Figure 2.4,
Rock County Map).

   Land Use
   As of 2000, agriculture, livestock, and mining activities comprise nearly 88 percent of land
   use in Rock County (Map A.5, Appendix A). Residential use is concentrated on rolling land

3/11/2011                                                                           Page 18 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange


   to the north of US 14, while agricultural use dominates the flatter areas to the south. There is
   very little commercial or institutional development along the corridor outside of cities,
   villages, and towns. The Town of Janesville is the most heavily developed town along the
   corridor in Rock County, with residential development occurring on the rolling lands east of
   County H and both north and south of US 14.

   Rock County is unique in that it has only limited ability to make decisions affecting land use;
   that ability lies primarily with the cities, villages, and towns through their independent
   planning and zoning authorities. Rock County's role is to assist communities with
   coordination and cooperation over areas of possible conflict. The County's land use
   recommendations are intended only as a tool to support and guide local planning. The Rock
   County Future Land Use Map (Map B.5, Appendix B) is a compilation of area future land
   use maps (see individual community land use maps for details). It is expected that agriculture
   will remain the primary land use in the county throughout the 2030 planning period.

   While limited in its ability to make land use decisions, the County helps maintain a balance
   among the preservation of environmentally sensitive areas, agricultural lands, and continued
   residential, commercial, and industrial development. The County intends to investigate the
   use of the following programs to support agricultural preservation: Purchase of Agricultural
   Conservation Easements (PACE), Purchase of Development Rights (PDR), and Transfer of
   Development Rights (TDR) programs.

   Transportation
   US 14 connects Rock County to Dane and Walworth Counties. The Union Pacific (UP)
   Railroad operates on tracks that extend from Evansville through Janesville and then southeast
   into Clinton before crossing into Illinois. UP operates a large rail yard centrally located in the
   City of Janesville. Its yard traffic is predominately dedicated towards serving automotive,
   food processing, and other non-farm bulk commodity industries.

   Rock County supports the study of a WIS 11 bypass, circumventing the south side of the City
   of Janesville from US 14 to I-43. The county also supports capacity improvements for US 14
   (Map C.5, Appendix C), from Janesville north to Dane County, to facilitate corridor
   preservation and safe movement of vehicular traffic. The County also supports rerouting
   traffic around Evansville.

Rock County Park, Outdoor Recreation, and Open Space Plan
In 2009, Rock County updated its Park, Outdoor Recreation, and Open Space Plan (POROS). In
this plan, the Bicycle and Pedestrian Routes and Trails Plan Map (Map D.2, Appendix D) depicts
locations for proposed off-road bicycle and pedestrian trails, Rock County bicycle routes, and the
Ice Age multi-use trail. One off-road bicycle/pedestrian route would follow US 14 between
Evansville and Janesville.

The POROS also includes an Ice Age Trail Corridor Plan for Rock County (Map D.3,
Appendix D). The Ice Age Trail corridor study area covers significant portions of Magnolia,
Center, Janesville, Milton, and Lima, and overlaps with the US 14 corridor study area. The Ice
Age Trail is discussed in greater detail at the end of this report.



3/11/2011                                                                              Page 19 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange


Town of Union Comprehensive Plan
The Town of Union is located in northwestern Rock County (Figure 2.4, Rock County Map). US
14 travels from the northwest to the southeast through town. The town is predominantly rural
with large amounts of agricultural land and wishes to promote managed growth that is consistent
with its rural character.

   Land Use
   As of 2006, agricultural operations, forestland, and other rural lands comprise nearly
   89 percent of land use in the town (Map A.6, Appendix A). Residential land use covers about
   4 percent of the town and is concentrated in several rural subdivisions in the southeast
   quadrant of town, north and east of Evansville and scattered along town roads. Small, mostly
   agricultural-based commercial and industrial land use is mostly located along US 14.

   The Town of Union Future Land Use Map (also the town's zoning map) identifies large areas
   for agricultural preservation in the northeast and western portions of town where future
   development would be restricted (Map B.6, Appendix B). Given the number of residents that
   commute to Madison and Janesville, future residential developments were placed with
   transportation routes in mind in the areas north and east of Evansville, but mainly east of US
   14. Land on both sides of US 14 from East Union Road to Elmer Road has been identified
   for future commercial development, using reverse frontage roads to minimize the number of
   properties needing access to US 14.

   Transportation
   US 14, WIS 59/213, County C, and County M are major roads serving the town. A Union
   Pacific Railroad line passes through town. In 1999 the Village of Oregon and the City of
   Fitchburg purchased the rail line north of Evansville; there are no definitive plans for future
   use of this segment. The line south of Evansville is active.

   The Town of Union Comprehensive Plan encourages a Park-n-Ride lot be located along
   US 14 between Evansville and Union to encourage carpooling to Madison and Janesville.
   The Town is also interested in WisDOT studying the feasibility of a US14 bypass around
   Evansville. However, the Town of Union Comprehensive Plan Transportation Map (Map
   C.6, Appendix C) does not show a bypass route around Evansville.

City of Evansville Comprehensive Plan
The City of Evansville is located in northwest Rock County (Figure 2.4, Rock County Map). US
14 travels through the city's northeast portion. While Evansville had the highest percentage
population growth in Rock County from 1990 to 2000, the City desires to maintain its "small-
town" charm.

   Land Use
   Residential development is spread throughout the city with the vast majority of
   neighborhoods on the western side of the city (Map A.7, Appendix A). Commercial land use
   is concentrated primarily in the downtown area along US 14, and north and east of
   downtown. Almost one-quarter of the land within the city limits is in use for agriculture.




3/11/2011                                                                             Page 20 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange


   The City is planning a new industrial park at the southeast quadrant of the US 14/County M
   interchange. New residential development is also planned around the outer edges of the city
   (Map B.7, Appendix B).

   Transportation
   US 14, WIS 59/213, County C, County M, and Main Street are major roads in Evansville.
   The Union Pacific Railroad line extends across the city. The line is abandoned north of the
   city limits; however, within the city and to the southeast, the rail corridor is an active freight
   line. The continued viability of this line is crucial to existing businesses and Evansville's
   long-term industrial growth.

   The City of Evansville Smart Growth Plan,
   Transportation Plan Map depicts two
   possible US 14 bypass routes using North
   Territorial Road (Figure 2.5, right). The first
   route follows the existing alignment of West
   Bullard Road, then south along North
   Territorial Road to its connection with the
   US 14 east of the city. The second route also
   begins at West Bullard Road then follows
   the existing alignment of North Territorial
   Road southeast
   to Tolles Road.
                                                      Figure 2.5: Possible US 14 Bypass Routes
                                                      Source: City of Evansville

   The City of Evansville Transportation Plan Map (Map C.7, Appendix C) depicts other bypass
   alternatives using existing roads, including WIS 59, WIS 138, and WIS 59/213. Residents
   strongly support establishing a truck route that would redirect truck traffic away from
   downtown; however, no specific alternative was identified as "preferred". The map also
   identifies potential future collector streets that would service new developments on the north
   and west sides of the city.

Town of Magnolia Land Use, Transportation and Farmland Preservation Plan
The Town of Magnolia is located in northwestern Rock County (Figure 2.4, Rock County Map).
While US 14 does not travel through the town, it is nearby. The town is predominantly rural with
large amounts of agricultural land and wishes to preserve its rural character.

   Land Use
   As of 2000, agricultural operations, forestland, and other rural lands comprise 88 percent of
   the existing land use (Map A.8, Appendix A). Residential land use covers nearly 3 percent of
   the town and is concentrated in a few rural subdivisions, in the hamlet of Magnolia at the
   intersection of County M and County A, and scattered along town roads. There is very
   minimal commercial/industrial land use in the town.

   The Town of Magnolia Future Land Use Map (Map B.8, Appendix B) reflects existing land
   use and identifies the vast majority of the Town as "Exclusive Agriculture".

   Transportation
   WIS 59, WIS 59/104, WIS 213, County M, County A, and County B are major roads serving
   the town. There is also an active Union Pacific Railroad line passing through town.

   No major transportation improvements are identified in the Town of Magnolia
   Comprehensive Plan (Map C.8, Appendix C).

Town of Porter Smart Growth Comprehensive Plan
The Town of Porter is located in northwestern Rock County (Figure 2.4, Rock County Map). US
14 travels through the southwest part of town. The town is predominantly rural with large
amounts of agricultural land, and wishes to retain its rural character.

   Land Use
   As of 2004, agricultural operations, forestland, other rural lands comprise 94 percent of the
   existing land use (Map A.9, Appendix A). Residential land use covers about 4 percent of the
   town and is scattered along town roads. There is no commercial land use in the town and
   only minimal industrial or manufacturing use.

   The Town of Porter Future Land Use Map (Map B.9, Appendix B) reflects existing land use
   and identifies the vast majority of land as agricultural, woodland, and scattered residential.
   There are three new areas of mostly infill rural single family residential development along
   the north side of US 14 that border with the Union between Wilder Road and Riley Road,
   and where US 14 crosses into the Center. There are no new non-residential developments
   planned.

   Transportation
   US 14, WIS 59, and County M are major roads serving the town. An active Union Pacific
   railroad line runs through the far southwest corner of the town.

   The Town of Porter Transportation Plan (Map C.9, Appendix C) does not show any major
   improvements; however, the Town has asked WisDOT to convert North Tolles Road from
   Cooksville to US 14 to an extension of WIS 138. Evansville supports this request and
   believes the south end of North Tolles Road could become part of a US 14 bypass around
   Evansville so a possible intersection between an extended WIS 138 and US 14 bypass should
   be considered in planning for either project in the future. The Town intends to work with the
   County or State to upgrade North Tolles Road to a county or state highway and to maintain
   WIS 138 as a state highway.

Town of Center Smart Growth Comprehensive Plan: 2005-2024
The Town of Center is located in northwestern Rock County (Figure 2.4 Rock County Map). US
14 travels through the northeast part of town. The town is predominantly rural with large
amounts of agricultural land, and is planning for little change to this character.

   Land Use
   As of 2004, agricultural operations, forestland, and other rural lands comprise 94 percent of
   the existing land use (Map A.10, Appendix A). Residential land use covers nearly 9 percent
   of the town and is concentrated in a few rural subdivisions north of US 14 and scattered
   along town roads. There is very little commercial or institutional land use.

   The Town of Center Planned Land Use Map (Map B.10, Appendix B) reflects existing land
   use and identifies the vast majority of land as agricultural, woodlands, and scattered
   residential. A small area of new single-family residential is identified in County H just south
   of the railroad. No new developments are proposed adjacent to the US 14 corridor.

   Transportation
   US 14, WIS 11, County A, and County H are major roads serving the town. An active Union
   Pacific railroad line runs through the northeastern portion of the Town.

   No major improvements are identified in the Town of Center Smart Growth Comprehensive
   Plan: 2005-2024 (Map C.10, Appendix C).

Town of Janesville Comprehensive Plan­2035
The Town of Janesville is located in the center of Rock County northwest of the City of
Janesville (Figure 2.4, Rock County Map). US 14 travels through the northeast portion of the
Town. While the town is predominately rural in character, there is a considerable level of urban
influence with clustered subdivisions and other residential concentrations as well as continued
annexation of land into the City of Janesville for the purpose of development.

   Land Use
   As of 2005, agricultural operations and other rural lands comprise 75 percent of existing land
   use (Map A.11, Appendix A). Residential land use covers nearly 20 percent of the town and
   is concentrated in the northern half of town and along the Rock River. There is relatively
   little commercial and industrial development.

   The Town of Janesville Future Land Use Map (Map B.11, Appendix B) represents the long-
   term "build out" of the town beyond the 25-year planning period. There are two large areas
   of "Planned Mixed Use" along the US 14 corridor that allow for small and medium scale
   agricultural uses, low-density single family residential lots and subdivisions, with only
   limited agriculture related business or industry and conditional use multiple-family
   residential uses. No new commercial or industrial development is proposed.

   Transportation
   US 14, WIS 11, County A, and County H are major roads serving the town. Although not
   located within the town, I-39/90 is easily accessible and serves as Rock County's principal
   arterial. The Wisconsin & Southern Railroad passes briefly through the town in section 34 on
   its northeasterly route through Rock County. No major transportation improvements are
   identified (Map C.11, Appendix C). The plan mentions interest by the City of Janesville in
   connecting WIS 11 with US 14 on the west side of the City. The plan indicates that the Town
   should be prepared to have policy in place to address how to manage development along this
   possible connection, but does not indicate support or opposition for the connection.

3/11/2011                                                                             Page 23 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange



City of Janesville Comprehensive Plan
According to 2004 population estimates, the City of Janesville is the 10th largest city in
Wisconsin and the 4th fastest growing in terms of number of people added. The city, which is
also the county seat, is located in central Rock County along major state and interstate
transportation corridors. US 14 extends from the northwest side of the city to the east with an
interchange at I-39/90 where the corridor study area ends.

   Land Use
   The City of Janesville Comprehensive Plan Existing Land Use Map (Map A.12,
   Appendix A) indicates that US 14 is mainly a commercial corridor within the city. There is a
   large extraction operation in the city just south of US 14.

   The City of Janesville Future Land Use Map (Map B.12, Appendix B) identifies new
   commercial development in the northwest quadrant of the city along US 14 east of US 51
   with residential use to the north. New low-density rural residential development is depicted
   adjacent to existing residential areas in the Town of Janesville between the Rock River and
   County F and between the railroad tracks and County A. This is reflective of the Town of
   Janesville Future Land Use Map that depicts "Planned Mixed Use" for these areas comprised
   of 85 percent rural residential, 5 percent commercial and industrial, and 10 percent small
   scale agricultural land uses. The City of Janesville Future Land Use Map also identifies areas
   of "Urban Reserve" at the outer edge of future developments that will likely be needed
   beyond the 2030 planning period. Premature exurban development and utility extensions are
   discouraged in these areas.

   Transportation
   US 14, US 51, WIS 26, and WIS 11 are major roads in the city. The city serves as a hub for
   several freight rail lines. Wisconsin & Southern operates east-west and north-south lines and
   also has a locomotive maintenance center. Union Pacific operates a southeast by northwest
   line; and the Iowa, Chicago, and Eastern Railroad operates on track in the middle of the city
   that extends south to Beloit. The Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport is at the southern
   edge of Janesville. The Janesville Transit System (JTS) provides bus service six days a week
   on six fixed routes with an additional express bus to Beloit.

   Over the next 20 years, there is substantial development planned in all directions on the city's
   edges, focused infill and redevelopment efforts, and notable federal, state and county
   investments in transportation facilities, will provide both transportation challenges and
   opportunities (Map C.12, Appendix C). The City supports the following improvement
   projects:
            A new west side bypass extending WIS 11 north from West Court Street to US 14;
            this is currently under study by WisDOT. The City strongly advocates for a corridor
            that extends due north from the current bypass and is strongly opposed to a route near
            to or west of County H since such a location would encourage urban and rural
            leapfrog development and be used by fewer vehicles than a route located further east.
            An I-43 spur between the WIS 11 south bypass at I-39/90 and I-43 on the existing
            US 14/WIS 11 corridor or a new alignment; this is currently under study by WisDOT.

Town of Harmony Comprehensive Plan­2035
The Town of Harmony is located in east central Rock County on the northeast side of the City of
Janesville (Figure 2.4, Rock County Map). While US 14 does not travel through the town, it is
located nearby. While the town is predominately rural in character, there is a high level of urban
influence that comes from sharing a border with the City of Janesville.

   Land Use
   The 2008 Town of Harmony Zoning Map (A.13, Appendix A) indicates that agricultural and
   other rural lands comprise 90 percent of existing land use . Residential land use covers nearly
   8 percent of the town and is concentrated in the northern third of the town in rural
   subdivisions between Janesville and Madison. There is little commercial and industrial
   development. The town has several defining natural characteristics including the
   Harmony/Milton Depressional Area (a natural site for groundwater recharge and open space),
   high quality agricultural soils, and topography and drainage patterns associated with the
   kettle moraine landscape.

   The Town of Harmony Future Land Use Map (Map B.13, Appendix B) concentrates all
   future development in the northern portion of town. This area of "Planned Mixed Use" is
   intended to be predominately single family residential development but would allow small
   and medium scale agricultural uses with accompanying housing, small neighborhood or
   agricultural business or industry and limited, conditional use multiple-family residential uses.
   The map also identifies a band of "Urban Reserve" to allow for urban expansion. The
   majority of the eastern part of town is proposed to remain agricultural.

   Transportation
   I-39/90, US 14, WIS 26, County Y, County A, and County M are major roads serving the
   town (Map C.13, Appendix C). The Wisconsin & Southern Railroad passes through the
   northwestern portion of the town, parallel to County Y.

   The Town of Harmony Comprehensive Plan does not include a Future Transportation Map;
   however, WIS 26 is scheduled to be improved within the next few years. In town, the
   existing 4-lane divided roadway will remain as-is and at the northern edge of the town, the
   new Milton Bypass will become WIS 26. Private driveway access onto WIS 26 will be
   relocated to existing side roads, new frontage roads, or new development streets. The
   expansion project will have a significant effect on land use in the Town of Harmony.

Wisconsin Land Legacy Report
The Wisconsin Land Legacy Report identifies places considered most important in meeting the
state's conservation and recreation needs over the next 50 years. There are 229 "Legacy Places"

one of which, the Dunn-Rutland Savannah and Potholes, lies within the US 14 corridor study
area.

The Dunn-Rutland Savannah and Potholes (Map D.5, Appendix D) extends from the southern
end of Lake Waubesa to the Rock County line. This area presents an opportunity to protect and
restore a unique natural setting in close proximity to rapidly developing urban areas. The area
contains scattered woodlots, creeks, wetlands, pothole lakes, grasslands, and oak savannahs. The
Dunn-Rutland Savannah and Potholes area has significant recreational potential, including cross
country skiing, off-road bicycling, dog sledding, horseback riding, hunting, and fishing.

Ice Age Trail Comprehensive Management Plan
The Ice Age National Scenic Trail follows features left by the last glacial advance in Wisconsin
(Maps D.5 and D.6, Appendix D). In 1983, the National Park Service completed a
Comprehensive Management Plan for the Ice Age Trail that provides guidance for its
development and management. About 600 miles of the planned 1,200-mile Ice Age Trail has
been built. Detailed planning is being done at the county level where significant trail system gaps
remain. The plans identify a corridor through which the remaining trail segments will be
developed according to standards set forth in the 2001 Handbook for Trail Design, Construction
and Maintenance.

In relation to the US 14 study area, the Rock County segment of the completed Ice Age Trail
extends approximately 3.7 miles from Janesville to Milton. As described previously in the Rock
County Parks, Outdoor Recreation, and Open Space Plan, the county intends to complete the
remaining segments of the trail that will connect with existing trails in Walworth and Green
Counties. When completed, the Rock County segment of the Ice Age Trail will extend from the
eastern Walworth County line to Milton, south to Janesville along the rail/trail, then continue
from the western edge of Janesville to Green County near Magnolia County Park. Existing
public lands would be utilized whenever possible for the new trail.

All of the communities within the study corridor have completed comprehensive plans as of the
time of this plan review. There is at least one community that is in the process of updating their
plan. Though there were many similarities in both land use and transportation issues identified in
the comprehensive plans, there were also some distinct differences. Table 2.4 highlights the
important transportation issues identified in the review of the plans.

2.3      Environmental Resources

It is imperative that special consideration be taken to avoid or minimize potential impacts to
water resources and habitat areas by working with state agencies and by employing effective
erosion control practices along the US 14 corridor.

Water Resources
Throughout the study area, there are several water resources near the US 14 corridor with the
Rock River being the primary resource. Tributary creeks and streams act as additional water
resources. The corridor passes through four separate watersheds (Map E.1, Appendix E).

Waters near or crossing the US 14 corridor that are designated by Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources (WDNR) as areas of special natural resource interests include the Rock River,
Frogpond Creek, and Allen Creek (Exhibit 2). This classification is given to water sources with
characteristics that provide key functions to habitat or ecosystems within their watershed.

A breakdown of the existing water resources is as follows (Maps E.2 and E.3, Appendix E):

         Badfish Creek Watershed
         The Badfish Creek Watershed lies in south central Dane County and northwest Rock
         County. The Badfish Creek in Rock County has the dubious distinction of being one of
         the top watersheds in Rock County for soil loss, which is estimated at 9 tons/acre/year.
         Soil loss in the Dane County section is more difficult to determine but is estimated to be
         8.3 tons/acre/year. This watershed is highly susceptibility to groundwater contamination
         based on WDNR groundwater mapping.

         Frogpond Creek is a small spring-fed stream that flows eastward along the southern edge
         of Dane County, crosses for a short distance into Rock County before crossing back into
         Dane County where it discharges into Badfish Creek, which discharges into the Yahara
         River and eventually the Rock River. The headwaters of Frogpond Creek are near the
         western terminus of the study area. Water quality problems are primarily due to polluted

3/11/2011                                                                                 Page 29 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange


       runoff and ditching and tiling in the headwaters area, which is buffered by a significant
       amount of wetlands. Several species of waterfowl that are rarely found in Dane County
       have nested in this area. The US Fish and Wildlife Service purchased a portion of these
       wetlands and is managing them as a Waterfowl Production Area.

       Allen Creek and Middle Sugar River Watershed
       The Allen Creek and Middle Sugar River watershed is located in northeast Green County,
       northwest Rock County and south central Dane County. Municipal wastewater treatment
       plants that discharge to surface water within the watershed include Belleville, Brooklyn
       and Evansville. Little is known about the existing quality of streams in this watershed.

       Allen Creek rises in southern Dane County, flows through northwest Rock County and
       northeast Green County before emptying into the Sugar River. Allen Creek Runs adjacent
       to US 14, and is the main source of Lake Leota. About 4.5 miles of the stream above
       Lake Leota are classified Class II and Class III trout waters. Below Evansville, Allen
       Creek was recently added to the state's anti-degradation list (NR 102) as an Exceptional
       Resource Water (ERW), affording it a greater level of protection. The stream below
       Evansville has a very good and diverse warm water sport fishery.

       Marsh Creek Watershed
       The Marsh Creek watershed is a small agricultural watershed that drains 44 square miles.
       Much of the middle and upper reaches of the creek have been ditched and straightened,
       thereby destroying habitat and making the stream silt-laden and sluggish. Cropland
       erosion is presently the primary cause of water quality problems. US 14 does not cross
       Marsh Creek and generally does not come within ½ mile.

       Rock River/Milton Watershed
       The Rock River and its tributary creeks and streams are the main water source for the
       Rock River/Milton Watershed. The US 14 corridor crosses the Rock River, west of the
       City of Janesville. The Rock River flows from Lake Koshkonong, which is located at the
       Rock, Dane and Jefferson County line. Lake Koshkonong and the Rock River are both on
       the Federal EPA list (303d) of impaired waters.

       Yahara River and Lake Kegonsa Watershed
       The Yahara River and Lake Kegonsa Watershed lies north of the US 14 corridor and is
       not in close proximity to the roadway.

Floodplain and Wetland Areas
Due to the presence of water sources along the US 14 corridor there are several floodplain zones
that either cross or are adjacent to US 14 (Map E.4, Appendix E). Detailed mapping shows the
floodplain area for Allen Creek in Evansville and the area of US 14 crossing of the Rock River
(Map E.5, Appendix E).

As a result of the proximity of the floodplain, general topography, and poorly drained soils in
low-lying areas, there are several wetland areas adjacent to US 14 (Map E.6, Appendix E). More
detailed mapping shows the wetland areas associated with Allen Creek in Evansville, and the

3/11/2011                                                                          Page 30 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange


areas associated with the US 14 crossing of the Rock River (Map E.7, Appendix E). Wetland
areas are generally listed by the WDNR as areas of special natural resources. These wetland
areas have been designated as high quality wetlands and are considered a key habitat resource.

Rare Species and Natural Communities
According to WDNR data, there is the potential for rare terrestrial and aquatic species and/or
community occurrences along the US 14 corridor (Map E.8, Appendix E). Terrestrial species
habitats are usually located adjacent to water as a source for food. Due to the varying topography
and drainage patterns of Rock and Dane County, there are also secluded habitats along hilltops
where terrestrial species can reside. Many of these hilly areas are limestone based and could
contain especially rare terrestrial species. Rare terrestrial species that are found to reside in
hilltop areas will not be affected by US 14 construction projects. Habitat changes along US 14
over the last 60 to 70 years, such as the conversion of agricultural land to residential, make it
likely that a significant amount of the rare terrestrial sightings previously identified are now
obsolete. Further coordination and investigation with state agencies will be needed when project
plans are more defined.

Topography and Natural Areas
The eastern portion of the US 14 corridor is bisected from the northwest by the meandering Rock
River, which flows out of Lake Koshkonong. Other defining natural characteristics that mark the
landscape of the area include varying topography and drainage patterns, uneven hills and ridges,
and poorly drained soils in low-lying areas, most of which are remnants of the last advance of
Wisconsin Glaciation roughly 10,000 years ago. US Geological Survey (USGS) mapping
provides standard series topographic data for the US 14 corridor (Maps E.9 through E.13,
Appendix E). DNR managed lands and areas of special natural resource interest are also located
near the US 14 corridor (Map E.14, Appendix E).

Hazardous Materials
Records maintained by state and federal regulatory agencies that list sites of potential
environmental concern were reviewed to identify any hazardous material sites along the US 14
corridor. Other available resources were also investigated to develop a better understanding of
the project corridor's history and that of the surrounding area that would help identify previous
activities that may have resulted in compromised environmental conditions.

A total of 42 closed sites or closed incidents were identified within ¼ mile of the US 14 corridor
along with three open ERP sites (Maps E.15 and E.16, Appendix E).

CHAPTER 3 ­ DATA GATHERING AND INVESTIGATION

3.1    Public Involvement

Public involvement has an important role in the study process. Comments received from the
public were used to identify specific locations that needed to be evaluated for deficiencies. Two
types of meetings were held: Local Officials Meetings (LOM) and Public Involvement Meetings
(PIM). Meeting minutes, concerns of local officials, and public comments were documented and
distributed (Appendix F and Appendix G).

3/11/2011                                                                           Page 31 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange



Two LOM's were held for this study. The first meeting was held March 10, 2010 at the request
of Evansville to discuss the purpose of the study and layout a timeline for its completion.
Representatives were in attendance from WisDOT, OTIE, Evansville, and Union.

The second LOM was held June 29, 2010 to present the results of the data gathering and discuss
any project concerns. Representatives were in attendance from WisDOT, the Study Team, and
local officials from several of the communities along the study corridor.

A PIM was held on October 27, 2010. The general public, along with local officials from the
various communities and counties along the corridor were invited to attend. Representatives
from WisDOT and OTIE conducted the open-house meeting and gave a brief presentation.
Various exhibits were used to allow those in attendance to review the data collected for the
study. Comments from the public were collected and used to help identify areas of concern
within the study corridor.

3.2    Traffic and Crash Analysis

Study Area

evening peak hours were identified as being 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM and 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM,
respectively (Figure 3.4, 2009 Existing Peak Hour Traffic Volumes). The traffic counts used to
determine the peak hour traffic volumes, peak hour factors, and the trucks percents for each
study area intersection have been included in this report (Appendix H).

Year 2009 Existing Traffic Operating Conditions
The study area intersections were analyzed based on the procedures set forth in the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). All intersection traffic control analysis was conducted using
Synchro 7. Intersection operation is defined by Level of Service (LOS). LOS is a quantitative
measure that refers to the overall quality of flow at an intersection ranging from very good,
represented by LOS A, to very poor, represented by LOS F. Since US 14 is designated as a
connector route under Connections 2030, LOS C has been defined as the acceptable LOS for
peak hour operating conditions. Descriptions of the various levels of service are as follows:

   LOS A is the highest level of service that can be achieved. Under this condition, intersection
   approaches appear quite open, turning movements are easily made, and nearly all drivers find
   freedom of operation. At signalized intersections, average delays are less than 10 seconds.
   At unsignalized intersections, average delays are less than 10 seconds.
   LOS B represents stable operation. At signalized intersections, average vehicle delays are 10
   to 20 seconds. At unsignalized intersections, average delays are 10 to 15 seconds.
   LOS C still represents stable operation, but periodic backups of a few vehicles may develop
   behind turning vehicles. Most drivers begin to feel restricted, but not objectionably so. At
   signalized intersections, average vehicle delays are 20 to 35 seconds. At unsignalized
   intersections, average delays are 15 to 25 seconds.
   LOS D represents increasing traffic restrictions as the intersection approaches instability.
   Delays to approaching vehicles may be substantial during short peaks within the peak period,
   but periodic clearance of long lines occurs, thus preventing excessive backups. At signalized
   intersections, average vehicle delays are 35 to 55 seconds. At unsignalized intersections,
   average delays are 25 to 35 seconds.
   LOS E represents the capacity of the intersection. At signalized intersections, average
   vehicle delays are 55 to 80 seconds. At unsignalized intersections, average delays are 35 to
   50 seconds.
   LOS F represents jammed conditions where the intersection is over capacity and acceptable
   gaps for unsignalized intersections in the mainline traffic flow are minimal. At signalized
   intersections, average vehicle delays exceed 80 seconds. At unsignalized intersections,
   average delays exceed 50 seconds.

Table 3.1 shows the Year 2009 existing traffic peak hour operating conditions at the study area
intersections. The Year 2009 existing traffic volumes as shown in Figure 3.4 as well as the
existing intersection geometrics, shown in Figure 3.2, were used in the analysis.

Acceptable LOS for peak hour operating conditions has been defined as LOS C.

As shown in Table 3.1, all movements at the eastbound approach of the US 14 intersection with
WIS 92 currently operates at LOS E conditions during the weekday morning peak period.

At the US 14 intersection with County F, all movements at the southbound approach currently
operate at LOS D conditions during the weekday morning and evening peak periods.

All movements at the southbound approach of the US 14 intersection with Newville Road
currently operate at LOS E conditions during the weekday evening peak period.

The eastbound through and left-turn movements as well as the left-turn movements at the
westbound, northbound and southbound approaches at the US 14 intersection with WIS 26
currently operate at LOS D conditions during the weekday evening peak period.

At the US 14 intersection with Pontiac Drive, the northbound through movements currently
operate at LOS D conditions during the weekday evening peak period.

 All other movements at the study area intersections currently operate at LOS C or better
conditions under the existing traffic control conditions.

Year 2009 Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis
A traffic signal warrant analysis was performed by Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc. at the US 14
intersections with WIS 92, County F and with Newville Road. Chapter 4C of the 2000 Manual
on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) outlines the standards for determining the need
for traffic signals at a particular location. For a traffic signal to be considered, at least one of the
following warrants must be satisfied. The eight signal warrants are listed below:
            Warrant 1   Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume
            Warrant 2   Four-Hour Vehicular Volume
            Warrant 3   Peak Hour
            Warrant 4   Pedestrian Hour
            Warrant 5   School Crossing
            Warrant 6   Coordinated Signal Systems
            Warrant 7   Crash Experience
            Warrant 8   Roadway Network

Since peak hour turning movement counts were taken for three hours in the morning (6:00 AM
to 9:00 AM) and three hours in the evening (3:00 PM to 6:00 PM), only Warrant 2, the
Four-Hour Vehicular warrant, has been evaluated for this project. However, if traffic signals
appear to be warranted based on Warrant 2 and WisDOT determines that traffic signals are a
potential remediation measure, the eight-hour vehicular warrant should be evaluated at that time.

The MUTCD has different criteria based on populations less than 10,000 people or speeds
greater than 40 mph. For the WIS 92 and County F intersections, since the population in
surrounding rural communities is less than 10,000 people and the speed limit is greater than


3/11/2011                                                                                Page 42 of 58

40 mph, the 70% minimum rural vehicular volume curves were used in this analysis at this
location. The 100% vehicular volume curves were used for the Newville Road intersection.
Warrant 2 is described below.
       Warrant 2, Four Hour Volume is satisfied if during any four hours of an average day
       the major street (US 14) and minor street (eastbound approach of WIS 92 or southbound
       approach of Newville Road) volumes fall above the four-hour curves (100% curve for
       Newville Road, 70% curve for WIS 92) shown in Appendix I.

Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis ­ US 14 intersection with WIS 92
The need for traffic signals was investigated at the US 14 intersection with WIS 92 under
Year 2009 existing traffic conditions. The warrant analysis assumes the intersection to include an
exclusive right-turn lane (a one lane approach) on the WIS 92 eastbound approach. Therefore,
none of the eastbound right-turn traffic was included in the warrant analysis. It is noted that the
posted speed limit along US 14 at this location is currently 55 mph.

       Warrant 2, Four Hour Volume, is not met for any of the required four hours, as shown in
       curves in Appendix I. Therefore, this warrant is not satisfied.

US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange


24.6 mile segment of US 14 from Old Stage Road to I-39/90. Crash frequencies, rates, and
severities were determined for the four sections of US 14 as shown in Table 3.5. Intersection
collision diagrams were also created for several of the intersections along the US 14 Corridor.
For each highway section and for each intersection listed below, crash statistics were
summarized by a variety of factors, including speed-related crashes, crash type, time of day, day
of week, driver age, vehicle damage level, alcohol involvement, and light and road conditions.
Reported deer-vehicle crashes were removed from the analysis. Figure 3.5 shows a summary of
the crash data for the study area corridor.

Table 3.5: US 14 Crash Analysis Parameters

Crash severity is referenced frequently throughout the crash analysis. The definitions for the
various crash severity levels, per the Law Enforcement Officer's Instructional Manual for
Completing the Wisconsin Motor Vehicle Accident Report Form (MV4000), are as follows:
             K (Fatal Injury): Any injury received in a traffic accident which results in death
             within 30 days of the accident.
             Type A (Incapacitating Injury): An injury other than a fatal injury which prevents the
             injured person from walking, driving, or from performing other activities which
             he/she performed before the accident.
             Type B (Non-incapacitating Injury): Any injury, other than fatal or incapacitating,
             which is evident at the scene. Evidence of injury may include known symptoms of an
             injury which are not directly observable.
             Type C (Possible Injury): Any injury which is not observable or evident at the scene
             but is claimed by the individual or suspected by the law enforcement officer.
             N (No Apparent Injury): No apparent injury to the operator. Commonly referred to as
             Property Damage Only (PDO).

For each crash, the maximum injury observed and reported by the officer defines its overall
severity level. The crash frequency and severity statistics for the four sections of US 14 as well
as 15 individual intersections are shown in Table 3.6. Crash rate statistics and comparisons to
statewide averages are shown in Table 3.7.

    For Sections 1, 2 & 3, the total crash frequency statistic is the number of crashes in the five year time period from January 1,
    2004 to December 31, 2008. For Section 4, which was located in a high-volume urban area, the total crash frequency statistic is
    the number of crashes in the three year time period from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2008. Includes all crashes that
    occurred on the corridor as well as crashes that occurred on side-street intersection approaches to the corridor. Deer crashes
    were excluded from study.

  For Sections 1, 2 & 3, the total crash frequency statistic is the number of crashes in the five year time period from January 1, 2004 to
  December 31, 2008. For Section 4, which was located in a high-volume urban area, the total crash frequency statistic is the number of
  crashes in the three year time period from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2008. Includes all crashes that occurred on the corridor as
  well as crashes that occurred on side-street intersection approaches to the corridor. Deer crashes were excluded from study.

  For Corridors, crash rate calculated as the number of crashes per 100 million vehicle miles. For Intersections and Curves, crash rate
  calculated as the number of crashes per one-million entering vehicles.

  For Corridors, average of Statewide Average Rate for Years 2004-2008 as published by WisDOT. For Intersections, the comparison
  rate shown above is the average crash rate from June 2005 Intersection Crash Summary for Wisconsin (Knapp & Campbell) for similar
  intersections (urban/rural, traffic control, and volume). This rate should not be considered a statewide average representative of all
  intersections in Wisconsin. Only intersections with (3 or more crashes in one year - rural areas, and 5 or more crashes in one year -
  urban areas) were included in the study (1,704 total intersections). The statewide average of all intersections would be expected to be
  lower than the comparison rate shown above.

Section 1 - Corridor
There were 116 crashes along Section 1 of US 14 from Old Stage Road to 1000 feet north of
Madison Street/WIS 213 in the five years analyzed. Exhibit 7.1 in Appendix H shows the crash
statistics for Section 1 of the US 14 Corridor. Crash statistics worth noting on this section
include:
                2 fatal crashes
                59 percent of crashes were run-off-the-road, including 17 overturns and
                47 fixed-object collisions
                35 percent of crashes occurred on horizontal curves
                9 percent of crashes were alcohol-related (statewide average is 6 percent)
                44 percent of crashes were speed-related1 (statewide average is 22 percent)
                52 percent of crashes occurred on wet, snowy, or icy roads (statewide average is
                38 percent)
                41 percent of crashes occurred at night, dusk, or dawn (statewide average is
                30 percent)

On Section 1, drivers appear to be having difficulty navigating the roadway during adverse
weather conditions, particularly the horizontal curves. Vehicles, when they did leave the
roadway, had a propensity to hit fixed objects or overturn. Speed, alcohol, and dark light
conditions also appeared to be factors in an above average number of crashes. Fatal crashes
occurred in the following circumstances:
                A driver of a northbound Yamaha motorcycle at 4:00 PM on April 2, 2004 was
                traveling at a high rate of speed and collided with a vehicle slowing to make a
                northbound left-turn at Holt Road. The motorcyclist was ejected and killed.
                A driver of a northbound Ford Windstar minivan at 5:00 AM on February 14, 2006
                ran off the road negotiating the curve north of W. Butts Corners Road, overcorrected,
                crossed both travel lanes and overturned. The driver was killed.

Section 1 - Intersections
Collision diagrams and statistical summaries of crashes were created for one intersection along
Section 1 (US 14/WIS 92). Exhibits 7.1.1a and 7.1.1b in Appendix J show the crash diagram and
statistics for the intersection within Section 1 of the US 14 Corridor. The crash analysis did not
appear to reveal any evident safety issues at this intersection.

Section 2 - Corridor
There were 47 crashes along Section 2 of US 14 from 1000 feet north of Madison Street/WIS
213 to Territorial Road in the five years analyzed. Exhibit 7.2 in Appendix J shows the crash
statistics for Section 2 of the US 14 Corridor. Crash statistics worth noting on this section
include:



1
    Speed related crashes are defined as crashes in which the officer had indicated "Speed Too Fast/Condition" or
    "Exceeding Speed Limit" in the driver factors section of the accident repo rt, or if a speeding citation was issued to
    at least one driver.

            2 fatal crashes
            21 percent of crashes were run-off-the-road, which includes 10 fixed-object collisions
            51 percent of crashes were rear-end collisions
            51 percent of crashes were intersection-related
            83 percent of crashes occurred on dry roads (statewide average is 48%)
            45 percent of crashes occurred during the PM peak period (2:00 PM to 5:59 PM)

On Section 2, there were more intersection-related crashes and less run-off-the-road crashes than
were observed on Section 1, as was expected because there are more intersections and fewer
curves. Fifty-one percent of crashes were intersection related and 51 percent of collisions were of
the rear-end variety. More than 80 percent of crashes on Section 2 were on dry road conditions
indicating that adverse road conditions did not appear to be a safety issue. There were 10
collisions with fixed objects. Almost half of all crashes on Section 2 occurred during the PM
peak period between 2:00 PM and 5:59 PM. Fatal crashes occurred in the following
circumstances:
            An eastbound car on US 14 at 11:00 PM on July 4, 2004 left the right shoulder of the
            roadway approximately 300 feet east of County M, struck a utility pole and
            overturned. Alcohol was a factor. The driver was killed.
            An eastbound car on US 14 at 1:00 AM on April 22, 2007 left the right shoulder of
            the roadway approximately 500 feet east of County M and overturned. Speed and
            alcohol were factors. The 16-year old driver was killed.

Section 2 - Intersections
Collision diagrams and statistical summaries of crashes were created for two intersections along
Section 2 of US 14 (US 14/Main Street and US 14/County M). Exhibits 7.2.1a through 7.2.2b in
Appendix J show the crash diagrams and statistics for the intersections within Section 2 of the
US 14 Corridor. The crash analysis did not appear to reveal any evident safety issues at these
intersections.

Section 3 - Corridor
There were 159 crashes along Section 3 of US 14 from Territorial Road to US 51 in the five
years analyzed. Exhibit 7.3 in Appendix J shows the crash statistics for Section 3 of the US 14
Corridor. Crash statistics worth noting on this section include:
            3 fatal crashes
            38 percent of crashes were run-off-the-road, including 15 overturns and
            40 fixed-object collisions
            27 percent of crashes were rear-end collisions
            45 percent of crashes were intersection-related
            69 percent of crashes occurred on dry roads (statewide average is 48 percent)
            34 percent of crashes occurred during the PM peak period (2:00 PM to 5:59 PM)

On Section 3, 45 percent of crashes were intersection related and 27 percent of collisions were of
the rear-end variety. Almost 70 percent of crashes on Section 3 were on dry road conditions
indicating that adverse road conditions did not appear to be a safety issue. There were 15

reported overturn crashes and 40 collisions with fixed objects. More than 1/3rd of all crashes on
Section 3 occurred during the PM peak period between 2:00 PM and 5:59 PM. Fatal crashes
occurred in the following circumstances:
            A westbound car on US 14 at 2:00 PM on November 1, 2006 left the right shoulder of
            the roadway approximately 1,000 feet east of Cassidy Road and overturned. Alcohol
            was a factor. The driver was killed.
            An eastbound truck on US 14 at 11:00 PM on December 23, 2006 left the roadway
            approximately 0.1 miles west of Tuttle Road. After negotiating the curve, the vehicle
            entered the right-shoulder, overcorrected, then crossed both travel lanes and
            overturned. Alcohol was a factor. The driver was ejected and killed.
            A westbound car on US 14 at 3:00 PM on July 5, 2008 crossed into the eastbound
            lane for unknown reasons and struck a semi-truck. The driver of the car was ejected
            and killed.

Section 3 - Intersections
Collision diagrams and statistical summaries of crashes were created for six intersections along
Section 3 of US 14. Exhibits 7.3.1a through 7.3.6b in Appendix J show the crash diagrams and
statistics for the intersections within Section 3 of the US 14 corridor. Any evident or potentially
addressable safety issues revealed by the crash analysis are shown below, including suggestions
to potentially address the issues.
            Tuttle Road
            County H
            County E
            o Issue: Nine failures to stop at the northbound County E stop sign resulting in run-
               off-the-road crashes.
            o Suggestion: Consider enhancing the indications of stop control (e.g., using a
               larger stop sign, using two stop signs on each side of the roadway, adding a
               flashing beacon to the stop sign, adding rumble strips on the northern approach,
               etc.). Also, consider adding a two-directional large arrow sign (W1-7) on the
               northern shoulder of US 14 facing the northbound approach lane of County E to
               help convey to drivers that the roadway ends.
            River Drive/Hackbarth Road
            o Issue: Six rear-end crashes on the westbound approach, including three that
               resulted in injuries.
            o Suggestion: Consider adding a westbound left-turn lane.
            Spring Hill Drive
            County F

Section 4 - Corridor
There were 269 crashes along Section 4 of US 14 from US 51 to I-39/90 in the three years
analyzed. Exhibit 7.4 in Appendix J shows the crash statistics for this section of the corridor.
Crash statistics worth noting include:




3/11/2011                                                                            Page 51 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange


            0 fatal crashes, although six Type A crashes were reported
            Crash rates and injury crash rates are substantially higher than the statewide averages
            for urban streets
            40 percent of crashes were rear-end collisions
            38 percent of crashes were angle collisions
            73 percent of crashes were intersection-related
            Nearly one-third of all weekend crashes occurred on Saturdays between 10:00 AM
            and 1:59 PM

There were significantly more intersection-related crashes reported in Section 4, than in Sections
1, 2 or 3; this is likely due to the predominately commercial land use in this section along with
higher volumes and signalized intersections. The crash rate was 129 percent higher than the
statewide average for urban streets and the injury crash rate was 160 percent higher. Thirty-eight
percent of crashes were angle collisions and 40 percent were rear-end collisions. Seventy-three
percent of crashes were intersection related. There were 25 crashes that occurred on Saturdays
between 10:00 AM and 1:59 PM, making up nearly one-third of all weekend crashes on
Section 4.

Section 4 - Intersections
Collision diagrams and statistical summaries of crashes were created for six intersections along
Section 4 of US 14. Exhibits 7.4.1a through 7.4.6b in Appendix J show the crash diagrams and
statistics for the intersections within Section 4 of the US 14 corridor. Any evident or potentially
addressable safety issues revealed by the crash analysis are shown below, including suggestions
to potentially address the issues.
            US 51
            o Issue: 19 left-turn angle crashes (4 to 6 in each direction).
            o Suggestion: Consider positive left-turn offsets in all directions and/or improved
               signal phasing or timing, particularly during the PM peak period.
            Kennedy Road
            Bell Street
            WIS 26
            o Issue: Patterns of rear-end crashes (7 in three years) on the northbound approach
               and left-turn angle crashes involving northbound through vehicles and
               southbound left-turners (10 in three years).
            o Suggestion: Evaluate signal timing for the northbound approach and southbound
               protected left-turn movement. It is suspected that platoons of vehicles may be
               arriving during the dilemma zone and/or adequate time is not provided for
               northbound through vehicles and/or southbound protected left-turn vehicles.
            Lexington Drive
            o Issue: Substantial pattern (23 occurrences in three years) of angle crashes
               between westbound through vehicles and eastbound left-turners.
            o Suggestion: Evaluate signal timing for the westbound through movement and the
               eastbound left-turn movement. Consider positively offsetting the eastbound and
               westbound left-turn lanes.

US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange


              o Issue: Pattern (6 occurrences in three years) of angle crashes between eastbound
                 through vehicles and westbound left-turners.
              o Suggestion: Evaluate signal timing for the eastbound through movement and the
                 westbound left-turn movement. Consider positively offsetting the eastbound and
                 westbound left-turn lanes.
              o Issue: Pattern (4 occurrences in three years) of rear-end crashes between
                 eastbound vehicles after the intersection, likely due to downstream congestion.
              o Suggestion: Evaluate signal timing, capacity, and coordination between
                 Lexington Drive and Pontiac Drive to minimize the queuing of one intersection
                 into the other.
              Pontiac Drive
              o Issue: Substantial pattern (24 occurrences in three years) of left-turn angle
                 crashes (13 involving westbound through vehicles; 11 involving eastbound).
              o Suggestion: Evaluate signal timing for the eastbound/westbound through
                 movements and the eastbound/westbound left-turn movements. Consider
                 positively offsetting the eastbound and westbound left-turn lanes.

3.3       Existing Geometric Deficiencies

The US 14 corridor roadway geometrics were evaluated by conducting field reviews of the
corridor and also by reviewing available as-built plans. Comments from local officials and the
general public were also used to identify potential problem areas within the corridor. The
geometric components reviewed consisted of the following:
          1. Horizontal deficiencies (curves, passing zones and intersections)
          2. Vertical deficiencies (vertical curves and sight distances)
          3. Typical section deficiencies (substandard lane widths, shoulder widths, sidewalk
             widths, etc.)
          4. Miscellaneous deficiencies

Horizontal Deficiencies
This horizontal alignment was reviewed by comparing curve data shown on as-built plans
against current design standards. Based on the available as-built plans, there are no horizontal
curves that were identified as currently being sub-standard. Some portions of the corridor do not
have any curve data due to the lack of existing as-built plans. Table 3.8 lists the existing
horizontal curve data within the corridor.

smaller radii than those listed below are considered to be substandard):
                  30 mph: minimum radius = 231 feet
                  50 mph: minimum radius = 833 feet
                  60 mph: minimum radius = 1,330 feet

The following intersections or horizontal curves have problems as identified by local officials,

Vertical Deficiencies
This review consisted mainly of reviewing the available as-built plans and comparing vertical
curve data against current design standards. Some portions of the corridor do not have any
vertical curve data due to the lack of existing as-built plans. Table 3.9 lists the existing vertical
curve data within the corridor.

Table 3.9: US 14 Corridor Vertical Curve Data

For the purpose of this study it is assumed that all existing vertical curves are Category 1 vertical
curves as detailed in the Facilities Development Manual (FDM), Chapter 11-10-5, Attachment 1.
The following are the desirable and minimum K-values for both crest and sag vertical curves.
Design speeds of 60 mph and 30 mph were used in the vertical curve analysis:

                 30 mph design speed Crest Curve:     Kdesirable = 31           Kmin = 19
                 60 mph design speedCrest Curve:      Kdesirable = 245          Kmin = 151

                 30 mph design speed Sag Curve:       Kdesirable = Kmin = 37
                 60 mph design speed Sag Curve:       Kdesirable = Kmin = 136

All six crest curves meet the minimum K-value for a 60 mph design speed; however, three of the
curves have K-values below the desirable. These are highlighted in the table above. Eighteen of
the sag curves meet the desirable K-value; while three sag curves are below the desirable K-
values. These are highlighted in the table above.

Typical Section Deficiencies
US 14 is identified as a Connector Route in WisDOT's Connections 2030 plan. The design
standard for a 2-lane rural highway with a 60 mph design speed is as follows:
                 Traveled way width: 24 feet (two 12-foot lanes)
                 Paved shoulder width: 3 feet
                 Gravel shoulder width: 7 feet
                 Lane cross slope: 2%

Table 3.10: US 14 Corridor Lane and Shoulder Widths

Traveled lane widths and paved shoulder widths meet current design standards. The majority of
the gravel shoulders throughout the corridor fall below the current design standard of 7 feet in
width, as indicated by the grey shaded areas in Table 3.10. The gravel shoulders between US 51
and Kennedy Road are considered to be acceptable, even though they are only shown as 4 feet,
since the overall shoulder width is still 10 feet. The existing lane cross-slope from Kennedy Road
to I-39/90 is acceptable for resurfacing projects, however, it should be upgraded to the current
design standard of 2.0% for reconstruction projects.

3.4      Planned Future Roadway Improvement Projects/Studies in the Area

There are several improvement projects that will be taking place inside the project corridor.
These are as follows:
      1. Drainage improvements will be made at the US 14/WIS 92 intersection. Construction of
         these improvements is scheduled for 2012.
      2. US 14 will be milled and overlaid from Janesville to Evansville. Construction is
         scheduled for 2012.
      3. The US 14 bridge over the Rock River will be replaced sometime between 2013 and
         2016.

There is also a corridor study currently taking place in the study area. This is a corridor study of
US 14 and WIS 11 in the Janesville area. Part of that study is analyzing the potential for a US 14
bypass on the west side of Janesville.

CHAPTER 4 ­ SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS

4.1      Summary of Existing/Future Land Use

All of the communities within the study corridor have completed comprehensive plans as of the
time of this plan review. There is at least one community that is in the process of updating their
plan. Though there were many similarities in both land use and transportation issues identified in


3/11/2011                                                                               Page 57 of 58
US 14 Corridor Study
WIS 92 Intersection ­ I-39/90 Interchange


the comprehensive plans, there were also some distinct differences. The summary matrix shown
in Table 2.4 highlights the important transportation corridors, and the potential transportation
effects to US 14 that were identified from the review.

4.2    Summary of Existing Traffic Conditions

Traffic data for the US 14 corridor from WIS 92 10 to I-39/90 was collected and analyzed to
identify the current and expected traffic operations of highway sections and intersections. This
section of US 14 is identified in the WisDOT Corridors 2020 Plan and the Connections 2030
Plan as a Connector route, which means that acceptable level of service for the facility is LOS C
or better. This means that sections that are found to operate (or be expected to operate) at LOS D
or worse should be considered for improvements.

Most of the intersections analyzed were found to currently operate at LOS C or better. The
following intersections operate at LOS D or worse; WIS 92, County F, Newville Road, WIS 26
and Pontiac Drive. The intersections that currently operate at LOS C or better will continue to do
so in the year 2035. A traffic signal warrant analysis was performed at the US 14 intersections
with WIS 92, County F and with Newville Road, and it was determined that signals were not
warranted at any of the intersections.

The crash analysis for the US 14 corridor showed that of the seven fatal crashes, alcohol was a
factor in four. The crash analysis of the intersections did not reveal any safety issues in sections
one or two. In section three there are safety issues at County E and Hackbarth Road. In section
four there are safety issues at US 51, WIS 26, Lexington Drive and Pontiac Drive.

4.3    Summary of Existing Roadway Geometrics

There are several areas in which US 14 does not meet current design standards. Based on a
review of available as-built plans, none of the existing horizontal curves are sub-standard. Six
existing vertical curves have sub-standard K-values. It should be noted that as-built plans were
not available for some portions of the project. Further analysis of the existing roadway
geometrics in those areas will be conducted and included in the Corridor Management Report.

Another area where the roadway does not meet current design standards is the gravel shoulder
widths. Many areas within the corridor have the required 3-foot paved shoulders; however the
outside gravel shoulders are less than the standard of 7 feet in many areas.

Sight distances are generally good at the intersections within the study area. However, there were
comments about numerous individual locations that should be evaluated for intersection
improvements.

MEETING DATE: March 10, 2010

LOCATION:             Evansville City Hall

RE:                   Project ID 5155-04-09 (Phase 1)
                      USH 14
                      STH 92 ­ Janesville (I-39/90)
                      Dane and Rock Counties

PURPOSE OF MEETING:

   1. To introduce the project to the City of Evansville and Town of Union and to receive
      feedback on the City and Town's concerns.

   2. To explain the project purpose and discuss the project steps and schedule.

SUMMARY OF ITEMS DISCUSSED:

   1. Dan Wietecha explained that Evansville requested the meeting because they are
      concerned that their views will not be fully incorporated in the study if they are not
      involved early in the process. Some of the issues the City is concerned with are truck
      traffic through Evansville, and a potential USH 14 bypass of Evansville.

   2. The city recently completed a large TIA on the east end of Evansville that can be made
      available to the study team.

   3. Mark Westerveld provided an overview of the study. He said that the purpose of the study
      is to preserve the corridor as it is; it is primarily a safety and access type study. The study


                                                 1
   will have two phases. The first phase will involve data gathering and will result in an
   existing conditions report. The second phase will result in a corridor management plan,
   which makes recommendations for improvements to the corridor.

4. Franco Marcos said that the study would take a regional perspective, and would need to
   be compatible with both WisDOT long range plans and local land use plans.

5. Kendall Schneider said the Town of Union completed a comprehensive plan about a year
   and a half ago, and that the Town would like to plan for any future improvements to the
   corridor. He also asked if the study included looking at rail facilities. Mark Westerveld
   said the study would include all transportation modes.

6. John Stockham asked if the study would look at a bypass of Evansville. Mark Westerveld
   said the focus of the study was on preserving the existing corridor through access
   management and spot improvements.

7. There was a question as to whether different intersection types, including roundabouts,
   would be looked at for the corridor. Mark Westerveld said that yes, different intersection
   types would be considered in areas where improvements are needed.

8. Franco Marcos pointed out that USH 14 is a connector route in the WisDOT Connections
   2030 plan. Sandy Decker asked for an explanation of the plan and what a connector route
   is. Franco Marcos said that the Connections 2030 plan was WisDOT's long range plan.
   Connector routes are two and four-lane facilities that connect important economic and
   population centers.

9. The City of Evansville is revisiting their comprehensive plan, and should have a new
   version complete by the end of the summer.

10. The upcoming project schedule includes a local officials meeting in early summer, once
    data gathering is complete, followed by a public information meeting. The existing
    conditions report is expected to be complete in the fall.

US 14 Study, Local Officials Meeting #1 - Minutes

ATTENDEES:            See Attendance Record

MEETING DATE: June 29, 2010

LOCATION:             Evansville Fire District, Training Room

RE:                   Project ID 5155-04-09 (Phase 1)
                      US 14
                      WIS 92 ­ Janesville (I-39/90)
                      Dane and Rock Counties

PURPOSE OF MEETING:

   1. To introduce and review the collected data, including traffic projections, environmental
      mapping, access control and land use.

   2. To get input from local officials regarding concerns with the roadway.

SUMMARY OF ITEMS DISCUSSED:

   1. Mark Westerveld (WisDOT) welcomed everyone to the meeting and introduced WisDOT
      and consultant staff in attendance.

   2. Darin Blang (OTIE) discussed the purpose of the meeting and gave an overview of the
      project limits and study process.

   3. Don Lee (Traffic Analysis and Design) discussed the traffic volumes on the corridor. He
      said that since the corridor is a Connections 2030 connector route, the threshold for
      considering 4-lanes is 8,700 vehicles per day. This doesn't mean the roadway has to be
      expanded to 4-lanes when volumes reach this threshold, just that a 4-lane facility should
      be considered.

   4. Don Lee summarized the crash data for each section of the corridor and provided some
      statistics for the crashes on each section.

   5. It was pointed out that there have been several fatalities at US 14/Bullard Road that do
      not seem to show up in the data. Don Lee explained that the data used was from 2004
      through 2008, and if these fatalities were after that time period, they do not appear in the
      data.


                                                1
6. There were concerns with the intersection of US 14 and J. Lindemann Drive. Eastbound
   through traffic uses the shoulder to pass vehicles stopped and waiting to make a left turn.
   It is also difficult to make a left turn onto US 14 at this location.

7. There were concerns with the intersection of US 14 and Tolles Road. It is difficult to see
   at this intersection due to the angle of Tolles Road as it approaches the intersection. The
   presence of a cemetery at this intersection would make correcting the intersection angle
   difficult and contributes to the sight distance issues.

8. Don Lee discussed the level of service (LOS) for the corridor. He stated that a
   Connections 2030 connector route should have LOS C or better. Currently most sections
   of the corridor have LOS C or better. However, in 2035, most sections of the corridor are
   projected to have LOS D or worse. He also explained that the LOS shown was for the
   peak hour.

9. There were questions about the LOS for intersections, specifically US 14 and WIS 92.
   Don Lee explained that the LOS shown was for the roadway section, and that intersection
   LOS was calculated separately. The intersection of US 14 and WIS 92 currently has LOS
   E.

10. Darin Blang discussed additional data collection that has been completed, including
    information on access points, land use, and natural and cultural resources.

11. Darin Blang discussed existing geometric deficiencies on the corridor. There are currently
    substandard vertical curves, shoulder widths, and lane cross-slopes. There was agreement
    that the vertical curves near Holt Road, which are sub-standard, create sight distance
    issues.

12. It was pointed out that it would be difficult to increase the shoulder width on the section
    of roadway east of Kennedy Road, due to limited space. It was also pointed out that a
    section of US 14 in the Janesville area is scheduled for reconstruction in 2016; there was
    a question if this study would be completed in time to have recommendations
    incorporated into this reconstruction project.

13. Darin Blang went through the project schedule. He said that the project should be
    completed in the next year and a half. This should be soon enough for any
    recommendations to be incorporated into the planned reconstruction project on US 14 in
    Janesville.

14. There was a discussion of the US 14/WIS 11 study which is currently being completed.
    This study is looking at a connection between US 14 and WIS 11 on the west side of
    Janesville. Darin Blang explained that this study began in 2003 and is still ongoing. There
    are no recommended alternatives yet, and the study probably won't be completed for 2 to




                                             2
   3 years. Mike Hoelker (WisDOT) pointed out that there would be coordination between
   the two projects since the same WisDOT and consultant staff was working on both.

15. There was a discussion of agricultural traffic on US 14. There is more cross traffic than
    through traffic with farm equipment on US 14. There are a significant number of trucks
    that use US 14.

16. Following the meeting, Dale Beske (Town of Rutland) provided information to the study
    team regarding a historic property on US 14 near WIS 92. This property is on the
    National Register of Historic Places. He also provided information regarding drainage
    issues in the US 14/WIS 92 area.

                       Evansville High School ­ Evansville
ATTENDEES:

See attached attendance sheet. Project team included representatives from WisDOT Southwest
Region, Oneida Total Integrated Enterprises (OTIE), KL Engineering, Vandewalle & Associates,
and Traffic Analysis and Design.

PURPOSE OF MEETING:

       To introduce the public to the study and explain the purpose and schedule for the corridor
       study.

       To gather information from the public regarding issues and concerns with the existing
       roadway.

MEETING SUMMARY:

       The meeting began with an open house format, running from 4:00 to 5:30 pm, during
       which time residents could view exhibits showing the corridor study limits and the traffic
       and crash data for the corridor.

       Following the open house period, Darin Blang, OTIE Project Manager, gave a brief
       presentation reviewing the study area, the purpose of the study, the study phases, and the
       results of the data gathering. He stressed that the purpose of the corridor study was to
       develop ways to maintain the existing roadway as long as possible. This study is not
       looking at expanding US 14 to 4-lanes or constructing a bypass of Evansville.

       Don Lee, Traffic Analysis and Design, discussed the traffic counts and projections, and
       the crash data for the corridor.

       After the presentation, there was a brief question and answer period, which is
       summarized below:

       Q: Is farmland considered in the natural and cultural resources?
       A: Yes, farmland impacts will be evaluated once specific improvement strategies are
          developed.

                                                              Between WIS 92 and I-39/90
                                                                        Dane and Rock Counties
                                                                         Project Id. 5155-04-09


Q: Can people be better informed about meetings; many did not receive letter.
A: A mailing list was developed for properties adjacent to the roadway. There is a need to
   keep the mailing list at a manageable number. Anyone on the sign in sheets from
   tonight's meeting will be added to the mailing list. There will also be news releases
   for upcoming meetings.

Q: What would the next steps be after recommendations are made?
A: After the recommendations are formally documented in the Corridor Management
   Plan, it would depend on DOT funding. Recommended alternatives could also be
   implemented with future resurfacing projects.

Mark Westerveld, WisDOT project manager, said that a website would be developed for
the project, which would eventually have all of the meeting materials.

After the presentation, the meeting returned to an open house format until about 7:00 pm.
The project team recorded comments heard during the informal, open house sessions.

o Many in attendance were opposed to any expansion of the roadway to 4-lanes and to a
  bypass of Evansville; there were also a few people in favor of expanding the roadway.

o Several individuals mentioned that local traffic uses Territorial Road as an unofficial
  "bypass" of Evansville.

o Several in attendance said there were safety concerns with some of the curves and
  intersections on the north end of the study corridor. Of particular concern were Butts
  Corners Road, Union Road, and Elmer Road.

o Some questioned if a signal was needed at the 4-way stop in Evansville.

o There seemed to be some consensus that during morning and evening peak periods,
  traffic is very heavy on US 14, and it is difficult to get on the road from side roads and
  driveways. During other hours, traffic is still steady and it can still be difficult to pull
  out onto the roadway.

o Concerns were expressed with the snow removal on US 14; it was felt that it was not
  done very well.

o There were concerns with the County M intersection.

o Several people asked if US 14 would be a detour route when I-39/90 is constructed to
  6-lanes; there were also questions about how a 6-lane interstate would affect traffic
  volumes on US 14.

o There were concerns with the driveways to the gas station at the 4-way stop in Evansville.
  The location of the driveways causes confusion and there are a lot of near misses.

o An individual thought the speeds are too high north of Evansville, and that WisDOT
  should do a speed study; they mentioned that there was lax enforcement in this area. They
  also expressed concerns that increased noise levels from traffic were reducing property
  values.

o Several people complained about the speed of vehicles coming down to the bridge at the
  Rock River; they also mentioned problems with vehicles using the public boat landing on
  N. River Road.

o An individual suggested adding more bypass lanes at intersections and driveways.

o An individual mentioned a problem with one of the curves near the bar south of Union;
  some drivers misjudge the curve and leave the roadway.

o There was concern with farm equipment using the roadway; it currently blocks and slows
  traffic. The shoulders should be wider to accommodate the farm equipment. In addition,
  the bridge across the Rock River is too narrow for farm equipment; some of the larger
  equipment uses both lanes and blocks traffic in both directions.

Subject: US 14 Corridor Study

November 1, 2010

Dear Mr. Westerveld and Mr. Blang:

We would like to begin by thanking you for your presentation on Wednesday, October
27, 2010 in Evansville regarding Highway 14 from Highway 92 to I 39/90. We found it to
be very informative. We were also glad we had the opportunity to talk with different
people related to the project.

Since part of our property is on Highway 14 between Polzin and Leith Road, we drive
Hwy 14 daily and have seen what we think are some needed improvements. These
include:

          At Highway F and 14 there needs to be a right turn lane in the westbound lane
       as well as a left turn lane. Along with these, there should be a left turn lane onto
       F in the eastbound lane.
          The pavement on the hill between Hwy F and the Rock River bridge needs to
       be resurfaces due to ruts and bumps. These cause vehicles to skid when
       breaking causing accidents. There are 2 eastbound lanes due to the steepness of
       the hill, and we feel adding a bypass lane or a left turn lane in the wetbound lane
       will help the flow of traffic around those who are turning left in middle of the hill
       into their subdivision.
          At the intersection of Hackbarth and Highway 14 there needs to be something
       put in the westbound lane to keep the flow of traffic on Hwy 14 moving around
       those who turn left onto Hackbarth. Our suggestions include either a left turn
       lane or a bypass lane traffic so traffic has room on the right to go around cars
       turning left. This concept has been implemented at the intersection of Leith
       Road and Highway 14 successfully.
          We feel this same thing need to be addressed at the intersection of Burdick
       Road and Highway 14. Putting in a left turn lane or a bypass lane for westbound
       traffic to go around cars turning onto Burdick will keep traffic moving.
          We're not sure what to do about the stretch between Evansville and Highway
       92, but this is a very dangerous stretch. Accident reports give numbers of
       accidents, but there is no way to count the number of near misses in this
       stretch. Something needs to be done here. Part of the issue is farm implements
       frequently traveling on the highway and cars trying to pass. It is a winding
       stretch.
          Is there a possibility of the intersecting roads to have a speed limit of
       55mph? Recently many of these roads have had a speed limit decrease to 45
       mph. This encourages drivers to stay on Hwy 14, thus increasing the amount of
       traffic on the highway instead of traffic taking an alternate route that would
       include these roads.

We have seen many farm implements using the highway and one of the above
suggestions gives them the opportunity to move to the right for cars to pass.

We are also concerned as Highway 14 will become very busy when the expansion
project of I 39/90 takes place. We can tell whenever there is an issue on the interstate
as we can see when traffic increases due to accidents on the interstate, and a decrease
when the interstate is cleared.

Thank you for the opportunity to add input into this process. We look forward to
attending the meeting in the future where the committee's recommendations will be
shared.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call.

Sincerely,

Chris Raymond                                            Anne Raymond

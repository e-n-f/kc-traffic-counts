SUMMARY

On May 18,2010, a field reconnaissance investigation ofthe Borel Bank Property (Property) was
conducted for the purpose of identifying sensitive plant and wildlife species, sensitive habitats and
potential biological constraints. The survey area for this rep011 incorporates approximately 15 acres
located north ofFairview Avenue in Castro Valley, California.

In summary, based on the initial reconnaissance survey, it was found that the Property contains areas
that exhibited positive indicators of wetland soils, hydrology and vegetation. A constructed drainage
feature (ditch) and areas containing standing water were observed during the May 2010 survey.
Photographs are provided in Attachment 3. Based on the results of our reconnaissance survey, the
site exhibited criteria used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to determine the presence
of jurisdictional wetlands/waters . A formal Corps delineation would be required to verify the
regulatory status ofthese features .

Based on suitable habitat types, soil conditions, and California Department of Fish and Game
(CDFG) data base occurrences in the vicinity of the site, four special-status plant species were
identified as having the potential to occur on the Property. These plants include big-scale
balsamroot (Balsamorhiza macrolepis var. macrolepis), Congdon ' s tarplant (Centromadia panyi
ssp. congdonii) , fragrant fritillary (Fritillaria liliacea) , and most beautiful jewel-flower
(Streptanthus albidus ssp. peramoenus). Two of the four plants species, the Congdon ' s tarplant and
fragrant fritillary , were presumed absent based on the historic nature ofthe last occurrence in the
vicinity of the Property and the large distance separating the last know observation of these plants fi·om
the Property. Our May 20 10 survey was performed during the recognized blooming period of the
big-scale balsamroot and most beautiful jewel-flower. Neither species was observed during this
survey. However, in order to document a negative finding, CDFG recommends multiple surveys to be
performed over the entire blooming period of each species. June is identified as the last month of the
blooming period for both the big-scale balsamroot and most beautiful jewel-flower. It is recommended
that an additional survey be performed prior to July to substantiate a negative finding for these two
species.

Several special-status bird and raptor species were also determined to have a potential to forage and
nest near the site based on suitable habitat types, large trees, and recent occurrences in the vicinity of
the Property. Therefore, a nesting bird survey 72 hours prior to the removal of vegetation and/or
construction is required to determine absence or presence of nesting bird species. If required ,
surveys should be performed prior to January to identifY any potential nesting trees prior to the birds
lying eggs. Once eggs have been laid, a buffer of at least 150 feet must be established around the
nest site and the site protected until August 15 or until the young have fledged . Due to the Jack of
small mammal burrows observed during the survey the Property is considered unsuitable to supp011
the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia). This species was not observed during the survey, nor was
any secondary evidence of their occupation, and is presumed absent from the site.
1.0   INTRODUCTION

At the request of Northbrook Homes, LLC, Olberding Environmental has conducted a biological
resources analysis of the Property, located within Castro Valley, Alameda County, California. This
biological resources analysis includes pertinent literature on relevant background information and
habitat characteristics of the site including the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB
20 I 0) and the California Native Plant Society ' s (CNPS) Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular
Plants of California, and a review of information related to species of plants and animals that could
potentially utilize the described habitats. A field reconnaissance investigation of the Property was
conducted on May I8, 20 I 0. This report documents the methods, results and conclusions for the
reconnaissance-level surveys associated with the biological resources analysis for the Propet1y.


2.0     LOCATION

The survey area for this study is situated to the n011heast of the intersection ofFairview A venue and
Walter Dinos Court. Attachment I, Figure I depicts the regional location of the Property in
Alameda County, while Attachment I, Figure 2 illustrates the vicinity of the Property in relationship
to the City of Castro Valley. Attachment I, Figure 3 identifies the location of the Property on the
USGS 7.5 Quadrangle Map for Hayward . An aerial photograph of the Property has been included as
Attachment I, Figure 4.

Access to the Property is attained by taking Interstate 580 West.                       Take the
Castro Valley Exit and turn right. Make a right onto Five Canyons Parkway and follow it for 2.25
miles. Turn right onto Fairview Avenue and continue for 0.75 miles. The Property is situated to the
north of Fairview Avenue prior to the intersection with Walter Dinos Court.


3.0    PROPERTY DESCRIPTION

The Prope11y encompasses approximately 15 acres and roughly forms the shape of a rectangle, with
the southern edge bound by Fairview A venue. Elevation ranges on the Property from 567 feet along
Fairview A venue to 683 feet near the middle of the Property and 604 feet at the northern edge. The
Propet1y has few flat areas and is comprised predominantly of gently sloping hillsides. A dirt access
road is located off of Fairview A venue between the Property fence line and the residence located
west of the Property.

The majority of the Property is composed of grazed, non-native annual grassland. Several pine trees .
occur on the southern portion of the Property near Fairview A venue. Many tall eucalyptus trees
occur just beyond the Property boundary near the northeast corner of the site. The Property is bound
by barbed wire fencing. Several existing homes are located to the east and west of the Property, but
the majority ofthe site is surrounded by open space.

At the time of the survey cows and horses were present on the Property. Three potential seasonal
wetlands occur within the Property boundaries. One is located near the northeast corner of the

                                                 2
Property close to the eastern fence line. The second is located along the western fence line where a
gate is located along the newly constructed road to the west ofthe Property. Both ofthese features
are located in topographical depressions. A third potential wetland feature is located on the north
facing slope of the hill located adjacent to Fairview Avenue. This feature is a potential wetland seep.
A small incised drainage ditch is located along the western fence line parallel to a dirt access road.
This ditch transports water in a north to south direction and flattens out prior to the Property
boundary at Fairview A venue.


4.0      REGULATORY SETTING

4.1     Federal Regulatory Setting

4.1.1    Plants and Wildlife

The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 (16 USC 1531 et seq., as amended) prohibits
federal agencies from authorizing, permitting, or funding any action that would result in biological
jeopardy to a plant or animal species listed as Threatened or Endangered under the Act. Listed
species are taxa for which proposed and final rules have been published in the Federal Register (U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS] , 2009a and 2009b). If a proposed project may jeopardize listed
species, Section 7 of the ESA requires consideration of those species through formal consultations
with the USFWS. Federal Proposed species (USFWS, 2009c) are species for which a proposed
listing as Threatened or Endangered under ESA has been published in the Federal Register. If a
proposed project may jeopardize proposed species, Section 7 of the ESA affords consideration of
those species through informal conferences with USFWS . The USFWS defines federal Candidate
species as "those taxa for which we have on file sufficient information on biological vulnerability
and threats to support issuance of a proposed rule to list, but issuance of the proposed rule is
precluded by other higher priority listing actions" (USFWS, 2009c). Federal Candidate species are
not afforded formal protection, although USFWS encourages other federal agencies to give
consideration to Candidate species in environmental planning.

4.1.2    Wetlands/Waters

The federal government, acting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has jurisdiction over all "waters of the United States" as
authorized by §404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and § 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899
(33 CFR Parts 320-330). Properties that cause the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters
of the United States require permitting by the Corps. Actions affecting small areas of jurisdictional
waters of the United States may qualify for a Nationwide Permit (NWP), provided conditions of the
permit are met, such as avoiding impacts to threatened or endangered species or to important cultural
sites. Properties that affect larger areas or which do not meet the conditions of an NWP require an
Individual Permit. The process for obtaining an Individual Permit requires a detailed alternatives
analysis and development of a comprehensive mitigation/monitoring plan.



                                                  3
     Waters of the United States are classified as wetlands, navigable waters, or other waters. Wetlands
     are transitional habitats between upland terrestrial areas and deeper aquatic habitats such as rivers
     and lakes. Under federal regulation , wetlands are defined as "those areas that are inundated or
     saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under
     normal conditions do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil
     conditions" (33 CFR Part 328.3[b]). Swamps, marshes, bogs, fens and estuaries are all defined as
     wetlands, as are seasonally saturated or inundated areas such as vernal pools, alkali wetlands, seeps,
     and springs. In addition, p01tions of the riparian habitat along a river or stream may be a wetland
     where the riparian vegetation is at or below the ordinary high water mark and thus also meets the
     wetland hydrology and hydric soil criteria.

     Navigable waters include all waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tides, including the open
     ocean, tidal bays, and tidal sloughs. Navigable waters also include some large, non-tidal rivers and

l    lakes, which are important for transportation in commerce. The jurisdictional limit over navigable
     waters extends laterally to the entire water surface and bed of the waterbody landward to the limits
     of the mean high tide line. For non-tidal rivers or lakes, which have been designated (by the Corps)
     to be navigable waters, the limit of jurisdiction along the shoreline is defined by the ordinary high
I    water mark. Other waters refer to waters of the United States other than wetlands or navigable
     waters. Other waters include streams and ponds, which are generally open water bodies and are not
     vegetated. Other waters can be perennial or intermittent water bodies and waterways. The Corps
     regulates other waters to the outward limit of the ordinary high water mark. Streams should exhibit
     a defined channel, bed and banks to be delineated as other waters .

      The Corps does not generally consider "non-tidal drainage and irrigation ditches excavated on dry
      land" to be jurisdictional waters of the United States (and such ditches would therefore not be
     regulated by the Corps (33 CFR Parts 320-330, November 13, 1986). Other areas generally not
     considered jurisdictional waters include: 1) artificially irrigated areas that would revert to upland
     habitat if the irrigation ceased; 2) artificial lakes and ponds created by excavating and/or diking of
     dry land to collect and retain water, used exclusively for such purposes as stock watering, irrigation,
l.   settling basins, or rice growing; 3) waste treatment ponds; 4) ponds formed by construction activities
     including borrow pits until abandoned ; and 5) ponds created for aesthetic reasons such as reflecting
     or ornamental ponds (33 CFR Part 328.3). However, the preamble also states that "the Corps
     reserves the right on a case-by-case basis to determine that a particular waterbody within these
     categories" can be regulated as a jurisdictional water. The EPA also has authority to determine
     jurisdictional waters of the U.S. on a case-by-case basis. Riparian habitat that is above the ordinary
     high water mark and does not meet the three-parameter criteria for a wetland, would not be regulated
     as jurisdictional waters of the United States.

     4.1.3 Migrat01y Bird Treaty Act

     Raptors are migratory bird species protected by international treaty under the Migratory Bird Treaty
     Act (MBTA) ofl918 (16 U.S.C. 703-711). The MBTA makes it unlawful to take, possess, buy, sell,
     purchase, or barter any migratory bird listed in 50 C.F.R. Part I 0, including feathers or other parts,
     nests, eggs, or products, except as allowed by implementing regulations (50 C.F .R. 21 ). Sections
     3503, 3503 .5, and 3800 of the California Depmtment of Fish and Game Code prohibit the take,
                                                       4
possession, or destruction of birds, their nests or eggs. Implementation of the take provisions
requires that Property-related disturbance at active nesting territories be reduced or eliminated
during critical phases of the nesting cycle (March 1- August 15, annually). Disturbance that causes
nest abandonment and/or Joss of reproductive effm1 (e.g. , killing or abandonment of eggs or young)
or the loss of habitat upon which the birds depend is considered "taking" and is potentially
punishable by fines and/or imprisonment. Such taking would also violate federal law protecting
migratory birds (e.g., MBTA) .

4.1.4     The Federal Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act

Although protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, both the bald eagle and the golden eagle are
also protected by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940 (16 U.S.C. 668-668c). The
Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and amended several times since being enacted in 1940,
prohibits anyone, without a permit issued by the Secretary of the Interior, from "taking" bald or
golden eagles, including their parts, nests, or eggs (USFWS 2010). The Act provides criminal
penalties for persons who "take, possess, sell , purchase, barter, offer to sell , purchase or barter,
transport, export or import, at any time or any manner, any bald eagle ... [or any golden eagle] , alive
or dead, or any part, nest, or egg thereof." The Act defines "take" as "pursue, shoot, shoot at,
poison, wound , kill, capture, trap, collect, molest or disturb" (USFWS 201 0).

For purposes of these guidelines, "disturb" means: "to agitate or bother a bald or golden eagle to a
degree that causes, or is likely to cause, based on the best scientific information available, 1) injury
to an eagle, 2) a decrease in its productivity, by substantially interfering with normal breeding,
feeding, or sheltering behavior, or 3) nest abandonment, by substantially interfering with normal
breeding, feeding, or sheltering behavior" (USFWS 2010).

In addition to immediate impacts, this definition also covers impacts that result from human-induced
alterations initiated around a previously used nest site during a time when eagles are not present, if,
upon the eagle's return, such alterations agitate or bother an eagle to a degree that interferes with or
interrupts normal breeding, feeding, or sheltering habits, and causes injury, death or nest
abandonment (USFWS 201 0).

4.2     State Regulatory Setting

4.2.1    Plants and Wildlife

Property permitting and approval requires compliance with California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA), the 1984 California Endangered Species Act (CESA), and the 1977 Native Plant Protection
Act (NPPA). The CESA and NPPA authorize the California Fish and Game Commission to
designate Endangered, Threatened and Rare species and to regulate the taking of these species
(§§2050-2098, Fish & Game Code). The California Code of Regulations (Title 14, §670.5) lists
animal species considered Endangered or Threatened by the State.

The Natural Heritage Division of the California Department ofFish and Game (CDFG) administers
the state rare species program. The CDFG maintains lists of designated Endangered , Threatened ,
                                                   5
    and Rare plant and animal species (CDFG , 2009a and 2009b ). Listed species either were designated
    under the NPPA or designated by the Fish and Game Commission. ln addition to recognizing three
    levels of endangerment, the CDFG can afford interim protection to candidate species while they are
    being reviewed by the Fish and Game Commission.

    The CDFG also maintains a list o'f animal species of special concern (CDFG 2009), most of which
    are species whose breeding populations in California may face extirpation. Although these species
    have no legal status, the CDFG recommends considering them during analysis of proposed property
    impacts to protect declining populations and avoid the need to list them as endangered in the future.

    Under provisions of §15380(d) of the CEQA Guidelines, the Property lead agency and CDFG, in
    making a determination of significance, must treat non-listed plant and animal species as equivalent
    to listed species if such species satisfy the minimum biological criteria for listing. In general, the
    CDFG considers plant species on List 1A (Plants Presumed Extinct in California), List 1B (Plants
    Rare, Threatened, or Endangered in California and elsewhere), or List 2 (Plants Rare, Threatened, or
    Endangered in California, But More Common Elsewhere) ofthe California Native Plant Society's
    (CNPS) lnvent01y ofRare and Endangered Vascular Plants ofCalifornia (Skinner and Pavlik 1994)
    as qualifying for legal protection under § 15380(d). Species on CNPS List 3 or 4 may, but generally
    do not, qualify for protection under this provision.

    Sensitive habitats include riparian corridors, wetlands, habitats for legally protected species and
    CDFG Species of Special Concern, areas of high biological diversity, areas providing important
    wildlife habitat, and unusual or regionally restricted habitat types. Habitat types considered
    sensitive include those listed on the California Natural Diversity Data Base' s (CNDDB) working list
    of "high priority" habitats (i.e., those habitats that are rare or endangered within the borders of
    California) (Holland, 1986).
J
    4.2.2   Wetlands/Waters

    The Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) regulates activities in wetlands and other
    waters through §401 of the Clean Water Act. Section 401 requires a state water quality certification
    for properties subject to 404 regulation. Requirements of the certification include mitigation for loss
    of wetland habitat. In the San Francisco Bay region, the RWQCB may take the lead over the Corps
    in determining wetland mitigation requirements. California Fish and Game Code §§ 1600-1607
    require the CDFG be notified of any activity that could affect the bank or bed of any stream that has
J   value to fish and wildlife. Upon notification, the CDFG has the discretion to execute a Streambed
    Alteration Agreement. The CDFG defines streams as follows:

             "... a body ofwater that flows at least periodically... through a bed or channel having banks
            and supporting fish and other aquatic life. This includes watercourses having a subswface
            flow that supports or has supported riparian vegetation. "
            (Stream Bed Alteration Program, California Department of Fish and Gam e).




I                                                                     6
    In practice, CDFG authority is extended to any "blue line" stream shown on a USGS topographic
    map, as well as unmapped channels with a definable bank and bed. Wetlands, as defined by the
    Corps, need not be present for CDFG to exer1 authority.

    4.2.3     California Environmental Quali(v Act

    According to Appendix G ofthe California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA 2005) Guidelines,
    the proposed project would have a significant impact on biological resources if it would:
1
          a) Have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any
             species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local or regional plans,
             policies, or regulations, or by the California Department ofFish and Game or U.S. Fish and
             Wildlife Service?
          b) Have a substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural
             community identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations or by the California
             Department ofFish and Game or U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service?
          c) Have a substantial adverse effect on federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404
             of the Clean Water Act (including, but not limited to, marsh, vernal pool , coastal, etc.)
             through direct removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other means?
          d) Interfere substantially with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife
             species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use
             of native wildlife nursery sites?
          e) Conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources, such as a tree
             preservation policy or ordinance?
          f) Conflict with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community
             Conservation Plan, or other approved local, regional, or state habitat conservation plan?


    5.0      METHODS OF ANALYSIS FOR GENERAL BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
l   A special-status plant and wildlife species database search and review was conducted using the
    CNDDB and other sources. An additional search was conducted for special-status plants using
    California Native Plant Society Inventory on-line (CNPS). Special-status species reports were
1   accessed by searching the CNDDB database for the Hayward, Dublin , Niles and Newark USGS 7.5
    minute quadrangles, which surround the Property, and by examining those species that have been
    identified in the vicinity ofthe Property. The database report identified special-status species known
    to occur in the region or those that have the potential to occur in the vicinity of the Property. The
    CNDDB report was used to focus special-status species analysis of the site prior to the
    reconnaissance surveys.

    An Olberding Environmental biologist conducted a reconnaissance-level survey of the Property on
    May 18, 201 0. The survey consisted of walking throughout the Property and evaluating the site and
    adjacent lands for potential biological resources. Existing conditions, observed plants and wildlife,
    adjacent land use, soils and potential biological resource constraints were recorded during the visit.


                                                          7
     Plant and wildlife species observed within and adjacent to the Prope11y during the reconnaissance
     survey are included in Attachment 2, Table 1.

     The objectives ofthe field surveys were to determine the potential presence or absence of special-
     status species habitat listed in the CNDDB database report and to identify any wetland areas that
     could be potentially regulated by the Corps (CNDDB 201 0). In addition, the Olberding
     Environmental biologist looked for other potential sensitive species or habitats, which may not have
     been obvious from background database reports or research. Surveys conducted after the growing
     season or conducted outside of the specific flowering period for a special-status plant cannot
     conclusively determine the presence or absence of such plant species; therefore, site conditions and
     habitat type were used to determine potential for occurrence. When suitable habitat was observed to
     support a special-status plant or animal species it was noted in the discussion for that particular
     species. Regulatory agencies evaluate the possibility of occurrence based on habitats observed on-
     site and the degree of connectivity with other special-status animal habitats in the vicinity of the
     Property. These factors are discussed in each special-status plant or animal section. Potential for
     occurrence of each special-status or protected plant and animal species was evaluated using the
     following criteria.

           ·   Present: The species has been recorded by CNDDB or other literature as occurring on the
               Property and/or was observed on the Property during the reconnaissance survey or protocol
               surveys.
           ·   May Occur: The species has been recorded by CNDDB or other literature as occurring
               within five miles of the Property, and/or was observed within five miles of the Property,
               and/or suitable habitat for the species is present on the Property or its immediate vicinity.
           ·   Not Likely to Occur: The species has historically occurred on or within five miles of the
               Property, but has no current records. The species occurs within five miles of the Property
               but only marginally suitable habitat conditions are present. The Property is likely to be used
               only as incidental foraging habitat or as an occasional migratory corridor.
           ·   Presumed Absent: The species will not occur on the Property due to the absence of suitable
               habitat conditions, and/or the lack of current occurrences. Alternatively if directed or
               protocol-level surveys were done during the proper occurrence period and the species was
               not found it will be presumed absent.

     Sources consulted for agency status information include USFWS (2009a, 2009b) for federally listed
     species and CDFG (2009a) for State of California listed species. Based on information from the
     above sources, Olberding Environmental developed a target list of special-status plants and animals
     with the potential to occur within or in the vicinity of the Property (Attachment 2, Table 2).

     5.1       Soils Evaluation

     The soils present on a property may determine if habitat on the site is suitable for certain special-
     status plants and animals. The host plants of some special-status invertebrates may also require
     specific soil conditions. In the absence of suitable soil conditions, special-status plants or animals
     requiring those conditions would be presumed absent. Information regarding soil characteristics for

                                                         8




l.
    the Property was obtained by viewing the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web
    Soil Survey report for the Property (NRCS 201 0).

    5.2     Plant Survey Methods

    The purposes of the botanical surveys were (1) To characterize the habitat types (plant communities)
    ofthe study area; (2) to determine whether any suitable habitat for any special-status plant species,
    occurs within the study area; and (3) to determine whether any sensitive habitat types (wetlands)
    occur within the study area. Site conditions and plant habitat surveys are impmtant tools in
    determining the potential occurrence of plants not recorded during surveys (e.g., special-status
    plants) because presence cannot conclusively be determined if field surveys are conducted after the
    growing season or conducted outside a specific flowering period.

    5.2.1    Review of Literature and Data Sources

    Olberding Environmental conducted focused surveys of literature and special-status species
    databases in order to identify special-status plant species and sensitive habitat types with potential to
    occur in the study area. Sources reviewed include: CNDDB occun·ence records (CNDDB 201 0) and
    CNPS Inventmy (Skinner and Pavlik 1994) for the Hayward, Dublin, Niles and Newark USGS 7.5
    quadrangles; and standard flora (Hickman 1993). From the above sources, a list of special-status
    plant species with potential to occur in the Property vicinity was developed (Attachment 2, Table 2).

    5.2.2    Field Surveys
1   A biologist from Olberding Environmental conducted a reconnaissance-level survey to determine
    habitat types and the potential for special-status plants based on the observed habitat types. All
l   vascular plant species that were identifiable at the time of the survey were recorded and identified
    using keys and descriptions in Hickman ( 1993).

    The habitat types occurring on the Property were characterized according to pre-established
    categories. In classifying the habitat types on the site, the generalized plant community
    classification schemes of A Manual of California Vegetation (Sawyer and Keeler- Wolf 1995) were
    consulted. The final classification and characterization of the habitat types of the study area were
    based on field observations.

    5.3     Wildlife Survey Methods

    The purposes of the wildlife surveys were to identify special-status wildlife species and/or potential
    special-status wildlife habitats within the study area.

    5.3.1    Review of Literature and Data Sources

    A focused review ofliterature and data sources was conducted in order to determine which special-
    status wildlife species had potential to occur in the vicinity ofthe Property. Current agency status
    information was obtained from USFWS (2009b, c) for species listed as Threatened or Endangered,
                                                       9
as well as Proposed and Candidate species for listing, under the federal ESA; and from CDFG (2009,
2009b) for species listed as Threatened or Endangered by the state of California under the CESA, or
listed as "species of special concern" by CDFG. From the above sources, a list of special-status
wildlife species with potential to occur in the Property vicinity was developed (Attachment 2, Table
2).

5.3.2 Field Surveys

General Wildlife Survev- An Olberding Environmental biologist conducted a survey of species
habitat within the entire study area, including visible portions of the adjacent properties, on May I8,
20 I 0. The purpose of the habitat survey was to evaluate wildlife habitats and the potential for any
protected species to occur on or adjacent to the Property.

Reconnaissance-Level Raptor Survev- A reconnaissance-level raptor survey was conducted in the
Property on May I8, 20 I 0. Observation points were established on the periphery of the site to view
raptor activity over a fifteen to thirty-minute time period. This survey was conducted with the use of
binoculars and notes were taken for each species occurrence. Additionally, utility poles and perch
sites in the vicinity of the Property were observed. All raptor activity within and adjacent to the
Property was recorded during the reconnaissance-level observation period.

Reconnaissance-Level Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) Survey - Reconnaissance-level
burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) surveys were also conducted in the Property on May I8, 20 I 0
to identify potential burrow sites or burrowing owl use of on-site habitat. The general presence and
density of suitable burrow sites (e.g., rodent burrows) was evaluated for the Property. Rodent
burrows encountered during the site visit were investigated for presence of potential burrowing owl
residence. Each potential burrow observed was evaluated for the presence of castings, whitewash,
bones, feathers or other signs of burrowing owl habitation. Observations were recorded. Utility
poles and any potential perching sites were investigated for signs of castings at the base of the posts.


6.0     RESULTS FOR GENERAL BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

The search and review of the CNDDB database reports revealed the occurrence of special-status
plant and wildlife species that occur in the habitats found within the Property boundaries (CNDDB
20I 0). The CNDDB database and background data were reviewed for the Hayward, Dublin, Niles
and Newark 7.5 minute quadrangles (Attachment 2, Table 2). Those animals listed in Attachment 2,
Table 2 were reviewed for their potential to occur on the Property based on general habitat types.
Most of the plant and several of the animal species identified by the CNDDB in the quadrangles
require a specific habitat microclimate that was found not to occur within the Property.

6.1   Soil Evaluation Results

The NRCS (20I 0) rep01ts two soil type within the Property. A detailed map of this soil type can be

     6.2     Plant Survey Results

     6.2.1    Floristic InventOIJI and Habitat Characterization

     In classifying the habitat types on the Property, generalized plant community classification schemes
     were used (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995). The final classification and characterization of the
     habitat types of the study area were based on field observations.

     The Property supports three habitat types that consist of non-native grazed annual grassland,
1    drainage ditch and potential seasonal wetland. These habitat types are described in further detail
l.
     below. A description of the plant species present within these habitat types is provided below.
     Dominant plant species are noted. A complete list of plant species observed on the Property can be
     found in Attachment 2, Table 1.

     Non-Native Grazed Annual Grassland Habitat

     The grassland habitat on the Property is characterized by dominant grass and forb species such as
     wild oat (Avena fatua) , foxtail (Hordeum murinum var. leporinum), Italian rye grass (Lolium

l.   multiflorum), soft chess (Bromus hordeaceous) and rip gut brome (Bromus diandrus). The entirety
     of the site is currently being grazed.


l    Drainage Ditch

     A small constructed drainage ditch exists along the western Property fence line near Fairview
     A venue. This ditch exhibits scouring and is an incised channel feature. The ditch carries water from
     the hillside slopes to the north south where it flattens out prior to reaching Fairview A venue.

     Potential Seasonal Wetland

     Several small areas of potentially seasonal wetland habitat were observed on the Property. These
 j   areas contained standing water and vegetation consisted of Italian rye grass (Lolium multiflorum)
     and rabbit' s foot grass (Polypogon monspeliensis). These areas were located in slight depressions in
     the topography where due to recent storm events, water has ponded and has formed wetland

 l   conditions. One feature is located near the eastern boundary and a second is located near the western
     boundary. A potential wetland seep is also located on the northern facing hillside slope.

    6.2.2 Special-Status Plant Species

    Special-status plant species include species listed as Rare, Threatened , or Endangered by the
    USFWS (2009a) or by the State of California (CDFG 2009a). Federal Proposed and Candidate
    species (USFWS , 2009b) are also special-status species. Special-status species also include species
    listed on List lA, List 1B, or List 2 of the CNPS Inventory (Skinner and Pavlik, 1994; CNPS 2009) .
    All species in the above categories fall under state regulatory authority under the provisions of
    CEQA, and may also fall under federal regulatory authority. Considered special-status species are
    species included on List 3 (Plants About Which We Need More Infmmation-A Review List) or List 4
    (Plants ofLimited Distribution-A Watch List) of the CNPS Invent01y. These species are considered to
    be of lower sensitivity and generally do not fall under specific state or federal regulatory authority.
    Specific mitigation considerations are not generally required for List 3 and List 4 species.

    Attachment 2, Table 2 includes a list of special-status plants with the potential to occur within or in
    the immediate vicinity of the Property based on a review of the USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles for
    Hayward, Dublin, Niles and Newark. The special-status plant species identified by the CNDDB as
    potentially occurring on the Property are known to grow only from specific habitat types. The
    specific habitats or "micro-climate" necessary for many of the plant species to occur are not found
    within the boundaries of the Property. The habitats necessary for the CNDDB reported plant species
    consist of valley and foothill grassland, cismontane woodlands, chaparral, playas, chenopod scrub,
    adobe clay soils, alkaline soils, serpentine soils, sandy soils, gravelly soils, coastal prairie, coastal
    scrub, coastal dunes, coastal bluff scrub, coastal salt marsh, vernal pools, seeps, meadows and sinks,
    marshes or swamps, riparian woodlands, on slopes near drainages, closed cone coniferous forest,
    north coast coniferous forest, redwood forest, lower montane coniferous forest, and broadleafed
    upland forest.

    Occurrences of special-status plants within a five-mile radius of the point roughly representing the
    center of the Property are described in detail. Occurrence distance from the Property is estimated
    from this center point (Attachment 1, Figure 6).

    Big-Scale Balsam root (Balsamorhiza macrolepis var. macrolepis). CNPS List lB.

    Bigscale balsamroot is an annual herb in theAsteraceae (Sunflower) family. The stems are finely
    hairy with whitish to pale green leaves. This species is found in chaparral, cismontane woodland ,
    open grassy slopes, and valley and foothill grassland habitats often in serpentinite outcrops,
    generally under 4,600 feet in elevation. It' s yellow flowers bloom from March through June. This
    plant can be found in the Sierra Nevada Foothills, Sacramento Valley, San Francisco Bay Area.

    This plant was most recently observed in 1997 approximately 4.5 miles northwest ofthe Property.
    This plant was not observed during the May 2010 survey and is presumed absent from the Property.


l   Most Beautiful Jewel-Flower (Streptanthus albidus ssp. peramoenus). CNPS List lB.

    Most beautiful jewel-flower is an annual herb in the family Brassiaceae, the mustard famil y. This

I   species is known from observations in Alameda, Contra Costa, Monterey, Santa Clara, and
                                                      13
    Stanislaus Counties. It occurs in chaparral , cismontane woodlands, and in valley and foothill
    grasslands in serpentine soils and its purple flowers bloom between April and June .

    This plant was most recently observed in 2003 , approximately 2.5 miles south of the Property. This
    plant was not observed during the May 20 I 0 survey and is presumed absent from the Property.

    6.3     Wildlife Survey Results


l   6.3.1    General Wildlife Species and Habitats

    A complete list of wildlife species observed within the Property can be found in Attachment 2, Table
    1. Wildlife species commonly occurring within habitat types present on the Property are discussed
    below:

    Non-Native Annual Grassland Habitat

    Seeds and vegetation provided by the annual grassland habitat provide an abundance of foraging
    opportunities for a variety of animals. Mammals that might be expected to occur in this habitat
    include western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus), black-tailed deer (Lepus californicus), and black-
    tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus)California vole (Microtus californicus), striped skunk (Mephitis
    mephitis), and opossum (Didelphis virginiana). Reptiles such as the gopher snake (Pituophis
    melanoleuces) and common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) may be present. The western fence
    lizard (Scelsporus occidentalis) was observed along the edges of the Property.

    A variety of bird species including black phoebe (Sayornis nigricans), house finch (Cmpodacus
    mexicanus), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), western
    scrub-jay (Aphelocoma californica), and Brewer's blackbird (Spizella breweri) were observed
    during the survey. Aerial foragers, including red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
    (Cathartes aura) , and American crow (Corvus brachrhynchos) were also observed.

l   6.3.2    Special-Status Wildlife Species

    Attachment 2, Table 2 includes a list of special-status wildlife species with potential to occur on the
    Property. Special-status wildlife species include species listed as Rare, Threatened, or Endangered
    by the USFWS (2009b & 2009c), as well as those species covered by the MBTA, or those species
    given special protection by the State of California (CDFG 2009b ).

    The search and review of the CNDDB database reports revealed the occurrence of special-status
    species that could potentially occur in the non-native annual grassland habitat on the Property. In
    addition, several state-protected raptors could forage and potentially nest within and adjacent to the
    Property. Attachment 2, Table 2 provides a summary of the species, their status, and habitat
    requirements. For the analysis of the site, the following specific discussions on the special-status
    wildlife included the following species (Attachment 1, Figure 5):



                                                      14
     AMPHIBIANS

     California Tiger Salamander (Ambvstoma cali(orniense). Federally Threatened, State
     Threatened.

     Adult California tiger salamanders (CTS) inhabit rolling grassland and oak savannah. Adults spend
     most of the year in subterranean retreats such as rodent burrows, but may be found on the surface
     during dispersal to and from breeding sites. The preferred breeding sites are vernal pools and other
     temporary ponds. However, CIS may use permanent manmade ponds as breeding habitat. CIS
     adults begin migrating to ponds after the first heavy rains of fall and can be found in or around the
     breeding ponds during and after winter rainstorm events. In extremely dry years, CIS may not
     reproduce.

     After mating, females lay several small clusters of eggs, which contain from one to over 100 eggs.
     The eggs are deposited on both emergent and submerged vegetation, as well as submerged detritus.
     A minimum of ten weeks is required to complete larval development through metamorphosis, at
     which time the larvae will normally weigh about ten grams. Larvae remaining in pools for a longer
     time period can grow to much larger sizes. Upon metamorphosis, juvenile CIS migrate in large
     masses at night from the drying breeding sites to refuge sites. Prior to this migration, the juveniles
     spend anywhere from a few hours to a few days near the pond margin. Adult CIS are largely
     opportunistic feeders, preying upon arthropod and annelid species that occur in burrow systems, as
     well as aquatic invertebrates found within seasonal pools. The larvae feed on aquatic invertebrates
     and insects, showing a distinct preference for larvae of the Pacific tree frog.

     On August 4, 2004, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) announced the listing of the CTS
     as threatened throughout its range with the exception of the Sonoma and Santa Barbara County
     populations which are listed as endangered (USFWS 2006). On August 23 , 2005 , the Service
     designated 199,109 acres of critical habitat in 19 counties for the central California population of the
     CIS. On August 2, 2005 , they proposed 74,223 acres of critical habitat for CIS in Sonoma County,
     California. This habitat is located in the Santa Rosa Plain in central Sonoma and includes lands
     bordered on the west by Laguna de Santa Rosa, to the south by Skillman Road, northwest of
     Petaluma, to the east by foothills, and to the north by Windsor Creek. On December 14, 2005 , in a
     final decision, USFWS designated and excluded 17,418 acres of critical habitat for CIS, so that no
     critical habitat is being designated for the Sonoma County population.

     No occurrences of this species have been made within a five-mile vicinity of the site within the last
     ten years (Attachment 1, Figure 5). Suitable habitat does not occur on the Property to support this
     species as the small ponded areas observed contained from 1-3 inches ofwater. Vernal pools or
     other temporary breeding ponds do not occur on the Property. Due to these factors, CTS is
     presumed absent from the Property.

California Red-Legged Frog (Rana dravtonir). Federally Threatened, California Species of
Special Concern.

California red-legged frog (CRLF) was listed as a Federal threatened species on May 31 , 1996 (61
FR 25813) and is considered threatened throughout its range. If a proposed property may jeopardize
listed species, Section 7 of the ESA requires consideration of those species through formal
consultations with the USFWS. Federal Proposed species (USFWS, 2006c) are species for which a
proposed listing as Threatened or Endangered under the ESA has been published in the Federal
Register. If a proposed property may jeopardize proposed species, Section 7 of the ESA affords
consideration of those species through informal conferences with USFWS . On April 13, 2006,
USFWS designated critical habitat for the CRLF. In total , approximately 450,288 acres fall within
the boundaries of critical habitat designation.

The CRLF is found in lowlands, foothill woodland and grasslands, near marshes, lakes, ponds or
other water sources. CRLF require dense shrubby or emergent vegetation closely associated with
deep still or slow moving water. Generally CRLF favor intermittent streams with water at least two
and a half feet deep and where the shoreline has relatively intact emergent or shoreline vegetation.
CRLF is known from streams with relatively low gradients and those waters where introduced fish
and bullfrogs are absent. CRLF are known to take refuge upland in small mammal burrows during
periods of high water flow. CRLF occurs west of the Sierra Nevada-Cascade and in the Coast
Ranges along the entire length of the state.

Several occurrences of this species have been made within the vicinity of the site within the last ten
years (Attachment 1, Figure 5). However, despite these recent occurrences, suitable habitat does not
occur on the Property to support this species. Permanent, deep breeding ponds or slow moving
creeks do not occur on the Property. Other potential breeding habitat was not observed in the
vicinity of the Property based on aerial photograph interpretation. In addition, no ground squirrel
burrows were observed during the survey that would serve as aestivation habitat for this species.
Due to these factors , CRLF is presumed absent from the Property.

REPTILES

Alameda Whipsnake (Masticophis latera/is eurvxanthus). Federally Threatened, State
Threatened.

The Alameda whipsnake is one of two subspecies ofthe California whipsnake. It is distinguished
from the chaparral whipsnake (M l. lateralis) by the broad orange striping on its sides. Adults reach
approximately three to five feet in length and show a sooty black to dark brown back, cream colored
undersides and pinkish tail. This species is typically found in chaparral , northern coastal sage scrub,
and coastal sage habitats; however annual grasslands, oak woodlands, and oak savannah serve as
habitat during the breeding season. Egg-laying occurs near scrub habitat on ungrazed grasslands
with scattered shrub cover. The known distribution for Alameda whipsnake includes Sobrante
Ridge, Oakland Hills, Mount Diablo, the Black Hills, and Wauhab Ridge.



                                                  16
         Male and female snakes are active from April to November finding mates. During the breeding
         season from late March through mid-June, male snakes exhibit more movement throughout their
         home range, while female snakes remain sedentary from March until egg laying. Females lay a
...;-!
         clutch of 6 to 11 eggs, usually in loose soil or under logs or rocks .

         There are several listed CNDDB occurrences of the Alameda whipsnake within a five-mile radius of
         the Project Area within the last 10 years, but due to the sensitivity ofthe data, the exact location is
         unknown. Critical habitat for the whip snake is also present within a 5 mile radius of the Project site.
         Reconnaissance level surveys ofthe Property revealed the presence of moderate secondary habitat
         for the Alameda whipsnake. Due to the unsuitable nature of the annual grassland habitat, the Jack of
         adjacent oak woodland or coastal sage habitats, and the developed nature of the surrounding
         habitats, the Alameda whipsnake is presumed absent from the Project Area.

         BIRDS

         Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperii). California Species of Special Concern, State Protected.
         Sharp-Shinned Hawk (Accipiter striatus). California Species of Special Concern, State
         Protected.

         The sharp-shinned hawk is a small raptor with short, rounded wings. This hawk has a long tail that
         is squared-off at tip with prominent corners. This raptor typically flies with several quick, snappy
         wingbeats and a short glide, but also soars. Its small rounded head does not project far beyond the
         wings when soaring. The adult sharp-shinned hawk exhibits a red eye, black cap, and a blue-gray
         back and upperwings. The white breast, belly and underwing coverts are marked by fine, thin,
         reddish bars.

         The Cooper's hawk is quite similar looking to the sharp-shinned hawk, although it is slightly larger
         in size and has a long rounded tail. Both hawks hunt in woodlands, riparian areas and even densely
         vegetated urban areas. These raptors capture small birds, rodents and reptiles. They often hunt
         along the edges of woodlands, shorelines, and riparian habitats where migrating passerines are
         found. Nesting habitat for these raptors consists of woodlands, coniferous forest, and dense oak
         woodland adjacent or close to open areas.

         Both of these raptors could potentially hunt within the grassland habitat the Property. Potential nest
         trees occur at the northeast corner of the Property in the form of eucalyptus trees. Pine trees also
         occur adjacent to the Property where either hawk could establish a nest site.

         Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia). Federal Species of Special Concern, California Species
         of Special Concern.

         The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has identified the burrowing owl is as a "candidate" species.
         Candidate species are animals and plants that may warrant official listing as threatened or
         endangered, but there is no conclusive data to give them this protection at the present time. As a
         candidate species, burrowing owls receive no legal protection under the Endangered Species Act
         (ESA). However, this species does receive some legal protection from the U.S . through the
                                                           17
Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which forbids the destruction of the birds and active nests. In California,
the burrowing owl considered a "species of special concern."

Burrowing owls are ground dwelling members of the owl family and are small brown to tan colored
birds with bold spots and barring. Burrowing owls generally require open annual grassland habitats
in which to nest, but can be found on abandoned lots, roads, airports, and other urban areas.
Burrowing owls generally use abandoned California ground squirrel holes for their nesting burrow,
but are also known to use pipes or other debris for nesting purposes. Burrowing owls prefer annual
grassland habitats with low vegetative cover. The breeding season for burrowing owls occurs from
March through August. Burrowing owls often nest in loose colonies about 100 yards apart. They
lay three to twelve eggs from mid-May to early June. The female incubates the clutch for about 28
days, while the male provides her with food . The young owls begin appearing at the burrow' s
entrance two weeks after hatching and leave the nest to hunt for insects on their own after about 45
days. The chicks can fly well at six weeks old.

No recent occurrence of this species has occmTed in the vicinity of the Prope1iy. The majority of the
grassland habitat on the Property is large and free of canopy cover. However, due to the lack of
small mammal burrows observed during the survey, and the tall , dense vegetation that covers the
site, the Property is considered unsuitable habitat to support the burrowing owl. This species was
not observed during the survey and is presumed absent from the site.

Red-Tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis). State Protected.

The red-tailed hawk is a large Buteo that is distinct due to the red color of its tail feathers in contrast
to the brown color of its body. Not all red-tailed hawks exhibit the distinct coloration on their tail
and gradations may occur especially in young birds. Red-tailed hawks hunt rodents by soaring over
grassland habitat. Nest trees for red-tailed hawks are usually tall trees with a well developed canopy
that includes a strong branching structure on which to build a nest.

The red-tailed hawk could potentially nest within the oak trees on the southwest corner of the site or
within the pine trees adjacent to the Property. It could also use these trees to perch while foraging
on adjacent lands. This species was observed foraging over the Property during the May 2010
survey.

Red-Shouldered Hawk (Buteo lineatus). State Protected.

The red-shouldered hawk is a medium-sized, slender Buteo with long legs and a long tail and is
smaller than the red-tailed hawk. Upperparts are dark with pale spotting, and rusty-reddish feathers
on the wing create the distinctive shoulder patch. The tail has several wide, dark bars; the
intervening narrow stripes and the tip of the tail are white, and there is variation in the number of tail
bars among adults and juveniles. The habitat that the red-shouldered hawk prefers varies from
bottomland hardwoods and riparian areas to upland deciduous or mixed deciduous-conifer forest,
and almost always includes some form of water, such as a swamp, marsh, river, or pond. In the
west, the red-shouldered hawk sometimes occurs in coniferous forests , and has been expanding its

                                                    18
    range of occupied habitats to include various woodlands, including stands of eucalyptus trees amid
    urban sprawl.

.
    The red-shouldered hawk could potentially nest within the eucalyptus trees near the northeast comer
    of the site or within the pine trees on the edges ofthe Prope1ty. It could also use these trees to perch
    while foraging on the Property and adjacent lands. This species was not observed during the May
    2010 survey. While this species generally prefers to hunt within riparian habitats, it has also been
    known to forage in grasslands near these areas. For this reason, the red-shouldered hawk has the
    potential to occur on the Prope1ty.

    White-Tailed Kite (Eianus /eucurus). Federal Species of Concern, CDFG: Fully Protected.

    The white-tailed kite is falcon-shaped with a long white tail. This raptor has black patches on the
    shoulders that are highly visible while the bird is flying or perching. White-tailed kites forage in
    annual grasslands, farmlands, orchards, chaparral, and at the edges of marshes and meadows. They
    are found nesting in trees and shrubs such as willows (Salix sp.), California sycamore (Platanus
    racemosa), and live oak (Quercus agrifolia) often near marshes, lakes, rivers, or ponds. This raptor
    often hovers while inspecting the ground below for prey. Annual grasslands are considered good
    foraging habitat for white-tailed kites, which will forage in human-impacted areas.

    The white-tailed kite could potentially nest within the eucalyptus and pine trees on and adjacent to
    the Property. This species is also well known to forage \Vithin grasslands amid urban sprawl. This
    species was not observed during the May 20 I 0 survey, but may occur.

    American Kestrel (Falco sparverius). State Protected.

    The American kestrel is the smallest ofraptor species and is distinct due to the black barring on its
    face. The female kestrel is slightly larger than the male bird and is differentiated by its brown and
    red coloration. The male kestrel is slightly smaller than the female and has gray wing patches near
    the top of the wing. Kestrels utilize cavities in trees for nesting and hunt small rodents and birds.

    Nesting cavities for the American kestrel were not observed within any of the trees on or adjacent to
l   the Property. These trees could , however, be utilized by this species to perch while foraging on the
    Property and adjacent lands. The American kestrel is also well known to forage within grasslands
    amid urban sprawl. This species was not observed during the May 2010 survey, but may occur.

    MAMMALS

    Special-Status Bats

    Bats (Order- Chiroptera) are the only mammals capable of"true" flight. They are nocturnal feeders
    and locate their prey which consists of small to medium sized insects by echolocation. Bats consume
    vast amounts of insects making them very effective pest control agents. They may eat as much as
    their weight in insects per day. Maternity roosts comprised of only females, may be found in
    buildings or mine shafts with temperatures up to 40 degrees Celsius and a high percentage of
                                                      19
humidity to ensure rapid growth in the young. Female bats give birth to only one or two young
annually and roost in small or large numbers. Males may live singly or in small groups, but
scientists are still unsure ofthe whereabouts of most males in summer.

Special-status bats with the potential to occur on the Proper1y are listed below. Due to the Jack of
roosting habitat on the Property (rock crevices, caves, tree hollows, abandoned buildings, dense
foliage of trees, etc.), the bats with the potential to occur on the Proper1y would use the site for
foraging purposes only.

Pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus), California Special Concern species

No recent occurrences of the pallid bat have been identified within 5 miles of the Property.
Marginally suitable foraging habitats occur throughout the Proper1y for this species. Roosting
habitat does not occur on the site. Bat species are presumed absent from the Proper1y due to the Jack
of recent occurrences and marginal foraging habitat.


7.0     CONCLUSIONS

7.1   Wetlands

Results of the biological resource analysis survey conducted by Olberding Environmental in May
2010 identified several areas within the Property that exhibited positive indicators of wetland soils,
hydrology and vegetation. Based on the results of our reconnaissance survey, the site contained the
criteria necessary for the Corps to determine wetland status. A formal delineation is required to
confirm presence/absence of jurisdictional wetlands.

7.2   Special-Status Plants

Two special-status plant species has the potential to occur on the Property based on the presence of
suitable habitats and soil types. These plants include big-scale balsamroot and most beautiful jewel

flower. However, neither plant was observed during the May 2010 survey which occurred during the
identified booming period. Both plant species are presumed absent from the site.

7.3   Special-Status Wildlife

Special-Status Amphibians- Several occurrences of CRLF have been made within the vicinity of
the site within the last ten years (Attachment 1, Figure 5). However, despite these recent
occurrences, suitable habitat does not occur on the Property to support these species. Vernal pools,
temporary breeding ponds, and slow moving creeks do not occur on the Property. In addition, no
ground squirrel burrows were observed during the survey that would serve as aestivation habitat for
either of these species. Due to these factors, both CTS and CRLF are presumed absent from the
Property.


                                                 20
Special-Status Reptiles- Despite the marginally suitable habitat that the site provides, the Alameda
whipsnake is presumed absent from the Property due to the Jack of rock outcrops, small mammal
burrows and sage scrub habitat. Despite recent occurrences within the vicinity of the Property, the Jack
of suitable habitat and the presence of heavy grazing make it unlikely that the Alameda whipsnake is
present on the Property.

Foraging or Nesting Raptor Species - The habitats on and adjacent to the Property provide
foraging and nesting habitat for the Cooper' s hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, red-tailed hawk, red-
shouldered hawk, white-tailed kite, and American kestrel. No nests were observed during the May
2010 survey, though a foraging red-tailed hawk was observed foraging over the site.

Due to the Jack of small mammal burrows observed during the survey, and the tall, dense vegetation
that covers the site, the Propetiy is considered unsuitable habitat to support the burrowing owl. This
species was not observed during the survey and is presumed absent from the site.

Special-Status Mammal Species -Marginally suitable foraging habitat occurs on site for bat
species. Roosting habitat does not occur on the site. Bat species are presumed absent from the
Property due to the Jack of recent occurrences and marginal foraging habitat.


8.0       RECOMMENDATIONS

      ·   It is recommended that a jurisdictional delineation be conducted in accordance with U.S.
          Army Corps of Engineers guidelines. This delineation would determine the boundaries of
          those features potentially qualifying as jurisdictional wetlands/waters by the Corps and/or
          Regional Board. If any features fall under the jurisdiction of the Corps or Regional Board,
          permit applications may be required prior to any site grading or fill of those qualifying
          features.

      ·   Proposed activities on the Property may result in vegetation removals that could directly
          destroy nests, eggs, and immature birds, and would remove future nesting habitat for birds,
          including sensitive species such as migrating songbirds. If impacts to on-site shrubs and
          trees cannot be avoided, then the removal of this vegetation will occur outside of the
          breeding season, which is typically between January and July. A nesting bird survey 72
          hours prior to the removal of vegetation and/or construction is required to determine absence
          or presence of nesting bird species. If the survey does not identifY any nesting special-status
          bird species in the area potentially affected by the proposed activity, no further mitigation is
          required. If nest sites or young are located, a no-disturbance buffer will be established
          around the active nest. The biologist will consult with CDFG to determine the size of the
          no-disturbance buffer, which is typically between 150 to 200 feet.

      ·   Pre-construction surveys for raptors would be necessary due to the presence of suitable
          nesting habitat on and directly adjacent to the Property. The eucalyptus trees, large oak and
          pine trees surrounding the Property should be surveyed if removal of the trees is to occur
          after January and prior to July. Surveys are also recommended if grading or construction
                                                    21
    traffic is to occur within a 100-foot distance of any known nesting site. If required , surveys
    should be performed prior to January to identify any potential nesting trees prior to the birds
    lying eggs. Once eggs have been laid , a buffer of at least 150 feet must be established
    around the nest site and the site protected until August 15 or until the young have fledged
    (typically 3 to 4 weeks). A nesting raptor survey 72 hours prior to the removal of vegetation
    and/or construction is required to determine absence or presence of nesting raptor species.

·   Grading and excavation activities could expose soil to increased rates of erosion during
    construction periods. During construction, runofffrom the Property could adversely affect
    aquatic life within the adjacent water features . Surface water runoff could remove particles
    of fill or excavated soil from the site, or could erode soil down-gradient, if the flow were not
    controlled. Deposition of eroded material in adjacent water features could increase turbidity,
    thereby endangering aquatic life, and reducing wildlife habitat. Implementation of
    appropriate mitigation measures would ensure that impacts to aquatic organisms would be
    avoided or minimized. Mitigation measures may include best management practices
    (BMP ' s) such as hay bales, silt fencing, placement of straw mulch and hydro seeding of
    exposed soils after construction as identified in the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
    (SWPPP).

·   Due to the presence of suitable habitat types, soil conditions, and recent occurrences in the
    vicinity of the Property, two special-status plant species has been identified as having the
    potential to occur on the Property- big-scale balsamroot and most beautiful jewel flower. It
    is recommended that a second survey be performed in June or next spring to validate a
    negative finding for these plants.

INTRODUCTION
The proposed University Crossing is a mixed use development located at the southwest
corner of the intersection of University Avenue and Whitney Way on the west side of the
City of Madison, Dane County, Wisconsin. The proposed project area is bordered on
the north by University Avenue, on the east by Whitney Way, on the south by a railroad
track which runs parallel to Old Middleton Road, and on the west by commercial
properties along University Avenue and residential properties to the south.

The site consists of 18 acres and is expected to be fully developed by 2018. The
property currently consists of several vacant buildings which will be razed and the PSC
building which will remain as an office building. Included in the proposed development
area is approximately 210,000 square feet of medical office/clinics in three buildings,
approximately 130 hotel rooms, a Hope Lodge with approximately 40 long term stay
rooms affiliated with long term patient stays at UW Hospitals and Clinics, a 65 unit
apartment building, approximately 40,000 square feet of general office space, and
approximately 23,000 square feet of proposed retail including approximately
3,000 square feet of proposed restaurant. A site map of the proposed development is
included as Exhibit 1.

There are currently six total access points in the proposed project area, three each onto
both University Avenue and Whitney Way. Currently, all of the access points onto
University Avenue are full access because there is no median on University Avenue to
restrict traffic movements. Two of the three access points on Whitney Way are right in /
right out because of a median on Whitney Way which restricts left turns in and out of the
property. The third access point on Whitney Way, which is located approximately
400 feet south of the University Avenue intersection, has a full median break which
allows all turning movements in and out of the proposed project area.

The purpose of this study is to determine the most efficient and safest alternative to
provide continued access to this property and to evaluate the impact of this
development and its access points on the existing street system. To provide adequate
access to the proposed development, a new public street is proposed which would
intersect University Avenue approximately 350 feet west of the Whitney Way
intersection and would intersect Whitney Way at the location of the current full access
point approximately 400 feet south of the University Avenue intersection. This study
evaluates traffic control alternatives for these access points and evaluates the effect of
these controls on University Avenue and Whitney Way traffic as well as nearby
intersections.

Individual intersections evaluated include:
     University Avenue and University Crossing "A" Street
     Whitney Way and University Crossing "B" Street
     University Avenue and Whitney
     Old Middleton Road and Whitney Way.

In addition to individual intersection evaluations, the roadway network was evaluated as
a whole with particular attention paid to the interaction between closely spaced
intersections.

Analyses of the street system were completed for the AM and PM peak hours and were
completed for 2012 and 2030 traffic. Because University Avenue is being reconstructed
in 2012 and the time frames for the individual buildings are currently being established,
the analyses for both time frames included full development. This represents a worst
case scenario, and is appropriate for planning the necessary improvements to
accommodate this development to coincide with the reconstruction of University
Avenue.

DATA COLLECTED
Existing hourly counts for Whitney Way, University Avenue, and the Old Middleton Road
ramps onto and off of University Avenue and turning movement counts for the Whitney
Way ­ University Avenue intersection were obtained from the City of Madison. The City
of Madison also provided KL Engineering with projections of 2030 traffic based on these
counts. In addition, KL Engineering conducted peak hour traffic counts of the Whitney
Way median break south of University Avenue and of the Old Middleton Road ­
Whitney Way intersections. Copies of these counts and projections are included in
Appendix A.

TRIP GENERATION
Trip generation rates were determined by using average trip generation rates obtained
from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) report, Trip Generation, 8th Edition,
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in 2008. This publication is
based on more than 4,800 trip generation studies submitted to the Institute by public
agencies, developers, consulting firms, and associations. A trip is defined as a single or
one-directional movement, with either the origin or destination of the trip being from the
proposed development. The trip generation categories from the ITE Trip Generation
Manual considered for this project were: Land Use 220, Apartment; Land Use 310,
Hotel; Land Use 311, All Suites Hotel; Land Use 610, Hospital; Land Use 630, Clinic;
Land Use 710, General Office Building; Land Use 720, Medical-Dental Office Building;
Land Use 814, Specialty Retail Center; and Land Use 932, High-Turnover (Sit-Down)
Restaurant;

Trip generation rates for the individual uses were determined based on the ITE rates
and added together. Some of the traffic for the new development will be making
multiple stops in the development and some trips will be internal to the development
and will not require the use of the street system. Therefore, the total trips were reduced
by 10% to 20%, based on use, to reflect these multiple­use and internal trips.

In addition, some of the trips to the retail areas will be "pass-by trips" which are defined
by the ITE Handbook "as intermediate stops on the way from an origin to a primary trip
destination without a route diversion. Pass-By trips are attracted from traffic passing the
site on an adjacent street or roadway that offers direct access to the generator. Pass-
by trips are not diverted from another roadway." These pass-by trips will not be new
trips to the surrounding streets, but they were included as new trips at the development
access points. A pass-by rate of 20% was assumed for the Specialty Retail Center and
the Restaurant with no pass-by rate assumed for the remaining properties. Both the
multi-use reduction and the pass-by adjustments are consistent with ITE standards and
are as discussed and agreed upon with the City of Madison Traffic Engineering staff for
similar developments.

Reduction for Multi-Modal Transportation Uses

In addition to the above reductions, a 10% to 20% reduction was taken for multi-modal
uses, again based on use. The proposed development is well served by Madison Metro
Transit and is located along multiple transit routes on University Avenue and Old
Middleton Road as well as on Whitney Way south of Old Middleton Road. There are
sidewalks along all streets in the area and the proposed project is planned to be
pedestrian friendly with sidewalks along both sides of the new internal street. In
addition, bicycle routes including paved bike paths, are prevalent in the area along
University Avenue, Whitney Way and Old Middleton Road. New walking/bike paths are
planned along the southern and western edges of the sight. There is potential for
commuter rail in the future along the existing rail corridor which delineates the southern
border of the development. The project plans to include Transportation Demand
Management plans which will stress transit, walking and biking. The combination of
these factors and the City of Madison's stated goals of increased use of alternative
modes of transportation indicate that a 10% to 20% reduction for multi-modal uses is
reasonable and these reductions were agreed upon with the City of Madison staff.

A summary of the trip generation for this development, for an average daily weekday,
PM peak hour, and AM peak hour; including the reduction for combined trips, pass-by
trips, and multi-modal trips, as well as projected years for each building is included as
Exhibit 2. It should be noted that the anticipated hours of operation for the medical
office buildings/clinics are 6 AM to 7 PM so they may actually have a lower impact on
the peak hours than shown in the tables, however ITE rates were used to model a
worst-case scenario.

After the above reductions are applied, the proposed development is anticipated to
generate a total of 7,260 trips on an average weekday with 766 of these trips in the PM
peak hour and 481 in the AM peak hour. Approximately 203 of the daily trips are
anticipated to be "pass-by" trips and approximately 7,057 are anticipated to be "new"
trips. Fourteen of the PM peak hour trips are anticipated to be "pass-by" trips and
approximately 752 of the PM peak hour trips are anticipated to be "new" trips. In the
AM peak hour, approximately nine of the trips are anticipated to be "pass-by" trips and
approximately 472 are anticipated to be new trips.

Development Access and Trip Distribution

Providing access to the proposed University Crossing Development is a challenge
because it is in a quadrant bordered by three arterial streets. This is further complicated
by a rail corridor which runs along the south side of the property parallel to Old
Middleton Road. This rail corridor restricts access onto Old Middleton Road; therefore
all access points to this development must be accommodated from Whitney Way and
University Avenue.

There are two access points proposed for this development. One is at the location of
the existing median break on Whitney Way approximately 400 feet south of University
Avenue and approximately halfway between Whitney Way's intersections with
University Avenue and Old Middleton Road. The second access point is on University
Avenue approximately 350 feet west of the Whitney Way intersection. Both of these
access points are closer than desirable to the signalized intersection of University
Avenue and Whitney Way. However, they are the only feasible alternatives to provide
adequate access to this property.

University Avenue is planned to be reconstructed in this area in 2012. The proposed
reconstruction includes a full median on University Avenue which will result in restricted
turning movements at midblock locations and at some intersections. As a result of this
new median, vehicles entering this development from the east and desiring to exit to the
west would not be able to access the development directly from University Avenue
without some modifications to the median to allow these movements.

As part of this traffic study, several alternatives for primary access to this development
were considered. These included:

      A roundabout on University Avenue with its proposed intersection with University
      Crossing "A" Street
         o Dismissed due to lack of space and proximity to the Whitney Way
            intersection
      A signalized median break on Whitney Way with its intersection with University
      Crossing "B" Street
         o As part of a previous traffic study, it was determined that a traffic signal
            would not be feasible at this location because of the close proximity of the
            intersections of Whitney Way with University Avenue and Old Middleton
            Road as well as the railroad crossing which is between this median break
            and the Old Middleton Road intersection. Observations during the PM
            peak hour confirm that traffic on Whitney Way often backs up through the
            median break intersection northbound as well as occasionally backing up
            to the median intersection southbound. In addition, vehicles exiting the
            development and desiring to go west would be required to make two left
            turns, one out of the proposed development onto Whitney Way and one
            from Whitney Way onto University Avenue. This would result in less
            efficient traffic movement than a single left turn from the development
            directly onto University Avenue.

                                            8
      A full median break on University Avenue at its proposed intersection with
      University Crossing "A" Street. This intersection would be controlled with either
      stop control on University Crossing "A" Street or a traffic signal and would allow
      all movements at this location including U turns.
      A channelized median break with a partial traffic signal which would control
      eastbound (inbound) University Avenue but would not stop westbound
      (outbound) University Avenue.        This option would require a merge into
      westbound University Avenue traffic for left turning vehicles exiting the
      development to go west on University Avenue. It would also require that U turns
      be accommodated at an alternative location.

These options were discussed with City of Madison staff and because of the traffic
patterns in the area and the close proximity of traffic signals as well as the railroad
crossing along Whitney Way, it was determined that the University Avenue intersection
with University Crossing "A" Street should be further evaluated as the primary access
point. Trips were then distributed to both access points based on the University Avenue
intersection being the primary access, specifically for vehicles desiring to exit to go
west. These trips were assigned to the proposed University Crossing "A" and "B"
Streets and the existing roadway system using current street system geometrics,
existing travel patterns and engineering judgment. Exhibit 3 shows how trips entering
and exiting the development were distributed on an average daily weekday. Exhibits 4
and 5 summarize trip distribution during the PM peak hour and Exhibits 6 & 7
summarize trip distribution during the AM peak hour. These trip distributions were
reviewed and adjusted based on discussions with the developer and City staff.

INTERSECTION AND CAPACITY ANALYSES
Capacity analyses were completed for the proposed intersections of University Crossing
"A" Street with University Avenue and "B" Street with Whitney Way and for the
intersections of Whitney Way and University Avenue and Whitney Way and Old
Middleton Road. Because of a previous study's determination that a traffic signal
should not be installed at the Whitney Way median break, the analyses at that
intersection were modeled with stop control on the "B" Street approach. All analyses
were completed using Synchro traffic analysis software. Synchro is based on the
methodologies from the Highway Capacity Manual and results in a level of service
(LOS) and average delay for intersections as well as for individual approaches and
traffic movements. A description of levels of service is provided in Appendix B. In
addition, average travel speed and queuing results were determined from Sim Traffic
software results. Sim Traffic is a microscopic simulation model that models each
vehicle in the network individually (randomly assigning a driver type and a vehicle type
to every vehicle as it enters the network). This methodology can provide more accurate
results than macroscopic models (Synchro) by factoring the interactions between
adjacent intersections and is therefore better suited to model interactions between
closely spaced intersections. Although the Sim Traffic results are fairly consistent with
Synchro and Highway Capacity Manual results, there may be some differences.
Synchro analyses are included in appendices C (PM) and D (AM) for 2012 and E (PM)
and F (AM) for 2030.

University Avenue and University Crossing "A" Street

As previously stated, the proposed intersection of University Avenue and University
Crossing "A" Street is located approximately 350 feet west of the intersection of
University Avenue and Whitney Way. As requested by the City of Madison Traffic
Engineering Department, three different alternatives were evaluated for this intersection:
a stop controlled full median break, a full median break with a fully operational traffic
signal and a channelized median break with a half traffic signal. These alternatives
were evaluated to determine which one would be the preferred alternative to provide
primary access to the west from this property, both operationally and from a safety
standpoint.

Full median break ­ Stop Controlled

A full median break at this location would allow left turns in and out of this development
as well as accommodating U turns. Because of concern regarding the proposed
installation of a signalized intersection so close to the Whitney Way intersection,
consideration was given to having this location be stop controlled. However, heavy
traffic volume on University Avenue results in a lack of gaps in traffic during some
portions of the day, specifically during the PM peak hour. Therefore, while a stop
controlled intersection would operate sufficiently with minimal traffic volumes, it is not
recommended as traffic volumes exiting the development increase. A Highway
Capacity Manual analysis of this median break results in LOS F for vehicles turning left
from the University Avenue "A" Street approach even with minimal development
                                           15
proposed for 2013. These delays would be expected to increase as traffic on University
Avenue increases and as the development reaches full build out by 2018.




                                         16
Full median break ­ Traffic Signal Controlled

As discussed previously, a traffic signal at this location would result in two traffic signals
within 350 feet of each other. Although this is generally not desirable, it is considered
an option at this location because of the need to provide access to this parcel of land
and the lack of acceptable alternative access points.

A signalized intersection here would require the construction of three approach lanes on
the University Crossing "A" Street approach. This would include a right turn lane and a
dual left turn lane. The construction of a dual left turn lane would result in the shortest
possible green time required for traffic exiting the proposed development to go west on
University Avenue, resulting in minimal red time on University Avenue. In order to
safely and efficiently accommodate traffic movements at this intersection with the least
disruption to through traffic on University Avenue, the construction of a left turn lane for
westbound University Avenue and a right turn lane for eastbound University Avenue for
traffic entering the development would be required. The traffic signal should be a three-
phase signal with protected/permitted left turns from University Avenue into the
development. U turns would be allowed for eastbound University Avenue traffic desiring
to U turn to proceed to the west. These U turns are necessary to provide access to the
west for the three business driveways serving the businesses on the south side of
University Avenue between this location and the Flambeau Road intersection. Direct
access to the west from these driveways is being eliminated by the median planned as
part of the 2012 reconstruction of University Avenue. The U turns would be permissive
and would be controlled by a flashing yellow arrow during the through green phase for
eastbound University Avenue. A short turn lane should also be constructed to
accommodate the U turning traffic. The proposed layout of this intersection is shown in
Exhibit 8.

The chart below summarizes the level of service and delays anticipated with a traffic
signal at this location during both the AM and PM peak hours. Because of the relatively
short length of green time required for the University Crossing "A" Street approach, the
University Avenue approaches are at LOS A. However, the primary issue is the
interaction between this intersection and the Whitney Way intersection and whether or
not a traffic signal can be installed without having significant impacts on the through
traffic on University Avenue. This will be addressed following the discussion of the
University Avenue ­ Whitney Way intersection capacity analyses.

Channelized Median Break ­ Traffic Signal Control for Eastbound (Inbound)
     University Avenue Only

Because of the nature of the University Avenue ­ Whitney Way intersection and the
heavy left turn from Whitney Way onto westbound University Avenue, coordination from
the University Avenue ­ Whitney Way intersection and the University Crossing "A"
Street intersection with University Avenue would not result in ideal traffic progression for
all traffic, specifically in the westbound direction. This is a result of the constant inflow
of traffic from the Whitney Way intersection and therefore no resulting "natural gaps" in
traffic approaching this intersection from the east. As a result, the City of Madison
requested that the installation of a "half traffic signal," stopping only eastbound
(inbound) University Avenue in conjunction with a channelized median, be considered.
This would allow for westbound University Avenue traffic to proceed through this
intersection without stopping and would require traffic desiring to exit the proposed
development to go west on University Avenue to merge with outbound traffic on
University Avenue. Eastbound University Avenue traffic would be controlled by a traffic
signal which would result in left turns into and out of the development being able to
cross the inbound lanes of University Avenue during independent protected traffic signal
phases. This option has the advantage of only stopping eastbound (inbound) University
Avenue and not stopping westbound (outbound) University Avenue except perhaps to
accommodate pedestrian or bicycle crossings.

A "half signal" on University Avenue would have virtually the same impact on eastbound
University Avenue as a full traffic signal. However, because westbound traffic on
University Avenue would not be required to stop at a "half signal"; theoretically, there
would be minimal adverse impacts to westbound traffic created by a half signal.

Although this option would work operationally for the majority of the time, a PM peak
hour analysis of a merge with the PM outbound traffic volume that University Avenue is
anticipated to carry in 2030, indicates that unless drivers are aggressive, the left hand
merge required could result in a back up of traffic in the merging area. The merge area
is designed to accommodate up to six vehicles, which is the approximate number of
vehicles which would be expected during an average phase of the half signal cycle.
Safety is also a consideration for this type of intersection. Although the City of Madison
reports good safety records at their existing "half signal" intersections, this location is
unique because of the lack of "natural gaps" that usually result from an upstream traffic
signal that are not present here because of the heavy dual left turn from Whitney Way
onto westbound University Avenue.

The proposed layout for this alternative is as shown in Exhibit 9. This option would
require a single right turn lane and a single left turn lane on University Crossing "A"
Street approach as well as the channelized median which would guide vehicles into the
merging area. If this option is selected, a separate channelized median break should be
provided to the west to accommodate U turning vehicles to provide access to the west
from the three driveways on the south side of University Avenue between this
intersection and the Flambeau Road intersection.

University Avenue and Whitney Way

Capacity analyses were also completed for the intersection of University Avenue and
Whitney Way. This is a T-intersection with a three-phase traffic signal including a
protected/permitted left turn phase for westbound University Avenue traffic turning south
onto Whitney Way. University Avenue is currently an undivided roadway with two
through lanes in each direction and an exclusive left turn lane for westbound traffic
turning left and an exclusive right turn lane for eastbound traffic turning right to proceed
south on Whitney Way. A planned reconstruction of University Avenue in 2012 will
include a raised median to create a boulevard on University Avenue and will result in a
longer left turn bay for westbound University Avenue traffic turning left onto Whitney
Way. As part of this reconstruction, the existing free flow right turn lane from eastbound
University Avenue to southbound Whitney Way will be signalized to provide for
protected pedestrian and bicycle crossings. Whitney Way is a boulevard which
intersects University Avenue on the south side and has two left turn lanes and a right
turn lane for northbound traffic. There are pedestrian phases for crossing all three legs
of the intersection.

All traffic modeling for this intersection was completed using Synchro and SimTraffic
software. Level of Service (LOS) and delay summaries for the intersection of University
Avenue and Whitney Way with base traffic and with projected traffic in 2012 and 2030
with proposed geometrics, proposed development traffic, and a traffic signal at the
University Avenue ­ University Crossing "A" Street intersection is summarized in the
following tables. It should be noted that the base traffic analyses and the development
traffic analyses for this intersection are not directly comparable because the existence
of a traffic signal at the University Avenue ­ University Crossing "A" Street intersection
results in some of the delay which is currently being attributed to the Whitney Way
intersection being attributed to the University Crossing "A" Street intersection following
the installation of a traffic signal there.

The SYNCHRO analyses show that with development traffic and traffic volumes
projected to 2030, this intersection operates at Level of Service C during the PM peak
hour and LOS B during the AM peak hour. All approaches on University Avenue and all
traffic movements, with the exception of the westbound left turn, operate at LOS C or
better during both peak hours. On Whitney Way, the LOS for northbound traffic is at
LOS D in 2030 with development traffic. All of these levels of service are acceptable
with the exception of the westbound to southbound left turn from University Avenue onto
Whitney Way which is anticipated to operate at LOS E in the PM peak hour with
development traffic in 2012 and LOS F in the PM peak hour with development traffic in
2030. As requested by the City of Madison, these levels of service were determined by
modeling with existing traffic signal timing. If the traffic signal splits are optimized to
accommodate the increase in left turns at this location, resulting from a combination of
traffic growth and the development, the LOS for the westbound to southbound left turn
will improve to LOS C without significantly adversely affecting other traffic movements at
this intersection. Also, there is a reasonable alternative route for this traffic. They can
exit westbound University Avenue at Old Middleton Road and proceed to turn right from
Old Middleton Road onto Whitney Way if they are going to the development. It is

                                            22
    anticipated that if the left turn from University Avenue onto Whitney Way becomes
    difficult or results in long delays, motorists will choose this alternative route.

University Avenue Progression Between Whitney Way and University Crossing "A"

Synchro analyses of the University Avenue ­ University Crossing "A" Street intersection
and the University Avenue ­ Whitney Way intersection both indicate that they will
operate with acceptable levels of service in 2030. However, because of the close
spacing of these intersections, the primary issue with a signal at the proposed
intersection of University Avenue and University Crossing "A" Street is the interaction
between this intersection and the Whitney Way intersection and specifically, what
impact a traffic signal here would have on through traffic on University Avenue.
Therefore, in addition to Synchro analyses, Sim Traffic models were evaluated to
determine travel time and delays on University Avenue between the two intersections.

In order to provide the best progression for University Avenue westbound traffic, the
offset for the traffic signal at the University Avenue ­ University Crossing "A" Street
intersection was set to clear the end of the green band which comes through the Segoe
Road intersection from the east and approaches this intersection from the Whitney Way
intersection. With this timing, there should be minimal impact on through traffic coming
from the east on University Avenue. With a dual left turn from the south on University
Crossing "A" Street, a green time of eight to 14 seconds resulting in a red time of 14 to
20 seconds for westbound University Avenue is less than the red time occurring at the
Whitney Way intersection. The same is true in the eastbound direction. Therefore, if
progression is maintained at all times between these two signals, through traffic coming
from the east on University Avenue would be minimally affected by this traffic signal.
Sim Traffic analyses confirm this, indicating that University Avenue through traffic
proceeding from the east would experience minimal delay resulting from a traffic signal
at the University Crossing "A" Street intersection. An exception to this would be when
there is a pedestrian call for crossing University Avenue which would result in a longer
red phase for University Avenue at University Crossing "A" Street and could affect
progression for individual traffic cycles.

Although through traffic on University Avenue will be minimally affected, timing this
signal to allow for best progression for University Avenue traffic will result in traffic that
has turned left from Whitney Way onto westbound University Avenue receiving a red
light as they approach the University Crossing "A" intersection. Therefore, unless some
concessions are made to the progression on University Avenue, Whitney Way traffic will
be significantly affected by the installation of a traffic signal at the "A" Street location.
Although this is not an ideal situation, analyses indicate that because of the relatively
short red light for westbound University Avenue, backups from this intersection should
not queue into the University Avenue ­ Whitney Way intersection. Depending on the
time of day and the utilization of the back of the green band approaching from the east,
the effect on Whitney Way traffic could be balanced with a minimal effect on westbound
University Avenue traffic if the offsets are adjusted slightly, resulting in some "straggler"
traffic on University Avenue not clearing this intersection, but improving progression for
Whitney Way traffic.

Whitney Way and University Crossing "B" Street

The intersection of University Crossing "B" Street and Whitney Way was also analyzed.
This intersection currently operates as a full median break with stop control on the
proposed development access and the access to the existing businesses on the east
side of Whitney Way.

Whitney Way is a four lane divided roadway with an existing full median break
approximately 400 feet south of the University Avenue intersection. This median break
serves the existing development on the east side of Whitney Way as well as the PSC
building on the west side of Whitney Way. The new public street serving the proposed
University Crossing and connecting University Avenue to Whitney Way is proposed to
intercept Whitney Way at this location. There are 100 foot left turn lanes for northbound
and southbound traffic to turn into the proposed development and the existing
development on the east side of Whitney Way.

As part of a previous traffic study, it was determined that a traffic signal would not be
feasible at this location because of the close proximity of the intersections of Whitney
Way with University Avenue and Old Middleton Road as well as the railroad crossing
which is between this median break and the Old Middleton Road intersection. In
addition, vehicles exiting the development and desiring to go west would be required to
make two left turns, one out of the proposed development onto Whitney Way and one
from Whitney Way onto University Avenue. This would result in less efficient traffic
movement than a single left turn from the development directly onto University Avenue.
Therefore it is recommended that this intersection by controlled with stop signs on the
eastbound and westbound approaches.

Highway Capacity Analyses were completed for this intersection. The analyses were
completed for total traffic with added development trips using 2030 projected traffic for
Whitney Way. The analyses assume a two lane approach to Whitney Way on the new
public street to adequately accommodate vehicles turning left, proceeding straight
through to the existing development on the east side of Whitney Way, and turning right.

Analyses in both the AM and PM peak hours show that with 2030 traffic projections for
Whitney Way and full build out of the development, this median break is anticipated to
operate with acceptable levels of service on all approaches. With 2030 traffic
projections for Whitney Way, the approach from the development is anticipated to
operate at LOS D with approximately 35 seconds of delay anticipated for traffic turning
left out of the development. This is not considered unreasonable for an urban
intersection during the peak hours. A summary of the level of service and delay for the
peak hour is shown in the following table. In both the AM and PM peak hour, the level of
service on Whitney Way remains at LOS A for traffic turning left into the development
and for through traffic on Whitney Way.

Whitney Way and Old Middleton Road
Synchro analyses indicate that this intersection currently operates at LOS D and is
projected to operate at LOS E during the AM and PM peak hours in 2030 with several
movements projected to operate at LOS F by 2030. The proposed development will
increase traffic by less than ten per cent at this intersection and is not anticipated to
have a major impact on individual traffic movements. The traffic signal currently
operates as a fully actuated-uncoordinated signal. It is recommended that consideration
be given to coordinating the traffic signal at this location with the traffic signal at the
University Avenue ­ Whitney Way intersection specifically during the PM peak hour.
This could help prevent the backups which currently occur on northbound Whitney Way
at the University Avenue intersection. Eliminating these backups would result in
improved operations at the Whitney Way median break.

ACCESS MANAGEMENT
As a result of the reconstruction of University Avenue planned for 2012, with the
exception of access points which will be eliminated because of the proposed
development, there are three driveway accesses on the south side of University Avenue
between Flambeau Road and Whitney Way which currently have full access and will be
restricted by the construction of a median on University Avenue. These driveways
serve Midas Muffler, Motorcycle Performance and the Spring Harbor Animal Hospital.
Because the median will restrict left turns out of these driveways, access from these
properties to the west will be provided by allowing a U-turn east of both driveways. The
current planned location for this U-turn is approximately at the location of University
Crossing "A" Street intersection with University Avenue. If a full median break is
provided at this location, the median break will be the planned location of the U-turn to
provide access to the west for these properties. If a channelized median break with a
half traffic signal is installed, a separate partial median break will need to be constructed
to the west to provide for U-turns. Both of these options will require a vehicle to turn
right out of the driveways and go east for a short distance and then make a U-turn to
proceed to the west.

There are no access points on the north side of University Avenue between Flambeau
Road and Whitney Way.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The University Crossing Development, in the southwest quadrant of the intersection of
University Avenue and Whitney Way, is a mixed use development which is expected to
begin construction in 2012 with full development completed by 2018. It is anchored by
three UW Health medical clinics and includes apartments, a small hotel, a long term
lodge and some general office and retail. After reductions for internal, mixed use and
multi-modal trips, the proposed development is anticipated to generate approximately
7,260 trips during an average weekday with approximately 766 of these trips in the PM
peak hour and 481 in the AM peak hour. Approximately 7,057 of the daily trips, 752 of
the PM peak hour trips, and 472 of the AM peak hour trips are anticipated to be new
trips.

These trips were assigned to the existing roadway system using current street system
geometrics, existing travel patterns and engineering judgment.              The proposed
development includes a new public street (University Crossing "A" Street and "B" Street)
which will have single access points on University Avenue ("A" Street) and Whitney Way
("B" Street). It is expected that the University Avenue intersection ("A" Street) will be the
primary access point, specifically for vehicles departing the development to the west.
Because of planned reconstruction, which includes the construction of a median and
therefore restricted left turn movements onto and off of University Avenue between
Segoe Road and Allen Boulevard, special accommodations were evaluated to provide
continued full access to this property, specifically left turns into and out of this
development at the University Avenue access location.

It should be noted that because of the nature of this development, with the majority of
trips generated by medical office buildings with anticipated hours of operation of 6 AM to
7 PM; there is less of a peak hour impact than typical office/retail developments, thereby
reducing the impacts to the existing traffic on the adjacent roadways during the peak
periods. On high volume commuter traffic routes such as University Avenue, less
concentrated trips during the peak hours are preferred. Additionally, construction of the
proposed development will eliminate two access points on University Avenue and one
access point on Whitney Way, thereby reducing conflict points.

Highway capacity analyses were performed at the intersections of the proposed new
public street with University Avenue and with Whitney Way and at the intersections of
University Avenue and Whitney Way and Old Middleton Road and Whitney Way. These
analyses were conducted for 2012 traffic and for 2030 projected traffic including
projected development traffic.        These analyses resulted in the following
recommendations:

       Install a full median break on University Avenue at its intersection with University
       Crossing "A" street. This intersection should be controlled by a traffic signal that
       is fully coordinated, including holding phases, with the University Avenue and
       Whitney Way traffic signal.        The signal should be three-phase with a
       permitted/protected left turn from University Avenue onto University Crossing "A"

                                             30
   Street and a "flashing yellow arrow" for eastbound University Avenue traffic
   desiring to U turn to go west.

   The proposed layout of this intersection is shown in Exhibit 9 and includes the
   following:
       o A 125 foot left turn lane from westbound University Avenue onto University
          Crossing "A"
       o A 50 foot right turn lane from eastbound University Avenue to University
          Crossing "A"
       o A 100 foot left turn lane (to accommodate U turning traffic) from eastbound
          University Avenue to westbound University Avenue
       o A three lane approach with dual left turn lanes and a right turn lane from
          northbound University Crossing "A" to westbound University Avenue. The
          dual left turns should be designed to encourage equal distribution of traffic
          in both lanes and should be a minimum of 80 feet long.
       o A signalized pedestrian/bicycle crossing should be accommodated on the
          south and east legs of this intersection.

   Maintain the current median break and construct a two lane approach on
   University Crossing "B" at its intersection with Whitney Way. Stop control should
   remain on the University Crossing "B" Street approach and on the private
   driveway approach from the east. The left lane on the University Crossing "B"
   Street approach should be a combination through/left lane and the right lane
   should be a right turn only lane. The right turn lane should be a minimum of
   75 feet.
   As development progresses, evaluate the signal timing, specifically the splits at
   the University Avenue-Whitney Way intersection to determine if a longer left turn
   phase from westbound University Avenue to southbound Whitney Way is
   advised.
   Consideration should be given to including the Old Middleton Road - Whitney
   Way traffic signal on the University Avenue system during the PM peak hour in
   an attempt to coordinate the northbound traffic on Whitney Way and minimize
   backups through the median break resulting from random arrivals on Whitney
   Way at the University Avenue traffic signal.

Although it is acknowledged that providing full access to this property, specifically for
traffic exiting the development to the west, is a challenge; accommodations need to
be made in order for this property to be developed. The recommendations
presented here result in full access to this property while creating only minimal
adverse effects for through traffic on University Avenue. The greatest impact to
traffic will be to traffic proceeding from Whitney Way onto University Avenue. This
traffic will be required to stop at the proposed University Crossing "A" intersection.
However, with full coordination of this traffic signal and the traffic signal at the
University Avenue ­ Whitney Way intersection, overall traffic impacts can be
minimized. In addition, the proposed traffic signal at University Crossing "A" Street
will result in some benefit to the University Avenue ­ Flambeau Road intersection
because of the gaps in traffic which will be created for westbound traffic.

SECTION 1.0             OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE OF THE FINAL EIR

This document, together with the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR), constitutes the Final
Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) for the proposed 625-685 Clyde Avenue Office Project in
Mountain View, California. Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the Lead
Agency is required, after completion of a DEIR, to consult with and obtain comments from public
agencies having jurisdiction by law with respect to the proposed project, and to provide the general
public with an opportunity to comment on the DEIR. The City of Mountain View, as the Lead
Agency, is then required to respond to significant environmental issues raised in the review and
consultation process, as described in CEQA Section 15132.

The DEIR was circulated to affected public agencies and interested parties for a 45-day review
period. Comments on the DEIR were to be received in writing by no later than Friday, December 21,
2012, at 5:00 p.m.

City of Mountain View                                                                     January 2013
1.2              PURPOSE OF THE FINAL EIR

In conformance with the CEQA Guidelines (Section 15151), EIRs should be prepared with a
sufficient degree of analysis to provide decisions-makers with information which enables them to
make a decision on the project that takes into account environmental consequences. The FEIR also is
required to examine mitigation measures and alternatives to the project intended to reduce or
eliminate significant environmental impacts.

The FEIR is used by the City and other Responsible Agencies in making decisions regarding the
project. The CEQA Guidelines require that, while the information in the FEIR does not control the
agency's ultimate discretion on the project, the agency must respond to each significant effect
identified in the DEIR by making written findings for each of those effects. According to the State
Public Resources Code (Section 21081), no public agency shall approve or carry out a project for
which an environmental impact report has been certified which identifies one or more significant
effects on the environment that would occur if the project is approved or carried out unless both of
the following occur:

      (a) The public agency makes one or more of the following findings with respect to each
          significant effect:

         (1) Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the project which will
             mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment.

         (2) Those changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another
             public agency and have been, or can and should be, adopted by that other agency.

         (3) Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations, including
             considerations for the provision of employment opportunities of highly trained workers,
             make infeasible the mitigation measures or alternatives identified in the environmental
             impact report.

      (b) With respect to significant effects which were subject to a finding under paragraph (3) of
          subdivision (a), the public agency finds that specific overriding economic, legal, social,
          technological, or other benefits of the project outweigh the significant effects on the
          environment.

All documents referenced in this EIR are available for public review in the City of Mountain View's
Community Development Department, City Hall, 1st Floor, 500 Castro Street, Mountain View,
during business hours, Monday thru Friday, 8:00 a.m. to Noon, 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.

The FEIR will also be available for review on the City's website, http://www.ci.mtnview.ca.us/, and
at the Mountain View Public Library, 585 Franklin Street, Mountain View. In accordance with the
CEQA Guidelines, the FEIR will be made available to the public and commenting agencies a
minimum of ten days prior to the EIR certification hearing.

SECTION 4.0              RESPONSES TO WRITTEN COMMENTS RECEIVED
                         ON THE DRAFT EIR

The following section includes all of the comments requiring responses contained in letters received
during the advertised 45-day review period by the City of Mountain View regarding the DEIR. The
comments are organized under headings containing the source of the letter and its date. The specific
comments have been excerpted from the letter and are shown as "Comment" with each response
directly following ("Response"). The letters submitted to the City of Mountain View on the DEIR
are contained in their entirety in Section 6.0 of this document.

A.      COMMENT LETTER A FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE CLEARINGHOUSE,
        DATED DECEMBER 26, 2012.

This letter documents compliance with the State Clearinghouse review requirements. No response is
required.

B.      RESPONSE TO COMMENT LETTER B FROM THE CALIFORNIA
        DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, DATED DECEMBER 11, 2012.

Comment B1: Thank you for including the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) in
the environmental review process for the project referenced above. The following comments are
based on reviews of the Draft Environmental Impact Report provided on November 13, 2012.

Traffic Operations
The City has not provided mitigation measures for the impacts that this project will have on State
Route (SR) 85, US 101, and SR 237 during AM and PM peak hours. The Draft Transportation
Impact Analysis under Freeway Impacts and Mitigation Measures on page 29 identifies freeway
improvement projects. The City should work with Caltrans to identify fair share mitigation fees for
appropriate freeway projects. For example, the US 101 Express Lanes Project, the US 101 Auxiliary
lane, and the SR 85 Auxiliary lane are not currently fully funded and mitigation impact fees could
contribute to these or other nearby projects.

Response B1:            The comment is acknowledged. The regional freeway improvements
                        referenced in Comment B1 will provide operational benefits within the
                        respective corridors. However, these regional freeway improvements and
                        would not directly mitigate the project's freeway impacts. Therefore, these
                        regional freeway improvements do not provide mitigation for the project's
                        significant freeway impacts as identified in Section 3.2.2.5 of the Draft EIR. 1

 Fehr & Peers. Memorandum to Scott Plambaeck, City of Mountain View. "Re: Response to 625-685 Clyde
Avenue Office Project Draft Environmental Impact Report Written Comments." January 25, 2013. This
memorandum is attached as Appendix A to this Final EIR.

625-685 Clyde Avenue Office Project                 5                                           Final EIR
City of Mountain View                                                                        January 2013
                        The US 101 Auxiliary Lane project falls outside the project study area,
                        meaning that the Auxiliary Lane project does not include any of the freeway
                        segments where the project would have significant freeway impacts.
                        Therefore, the Auxiliary Lane project would not provide any direct mitigation
                        for the project's significant freeway impacts associated with contribution of
                        trips equal to or greater than one percent of freeway segment capacity.
                        Furthermore, the VTA's Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) Guidelines
                        provide that auxiliary lanes shall not be considered for the purpose of
                        calculating the amount of added traffic based on freeway segment capacity.
                        (VTA TIA Guidelines, 2.2.2, p. 10). Accordingly, installation of a new
                        auxiliary lane would not change the results of the freeway analysis set forth in
                        Section 3.2.2.5 of the Draft EIR. 2

                        The US 101, SR 85, and SR 237 Express Lane programs involve conversion
                        of existing High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes to high-performance
                        express lanes. These programs allow single-occupancy vehicles to utilize the
                        express lane by paying a toll to alleviate the existing congestion on mixed-
                        flow lanes. However, the Express Lanes do not increase capacity by adding
                        additional lanes. Accordingly, the Express Lane projects would not change
                        the results of the freeway analysis set forth in Section 3.2.2.5 of the Draft
                        EIR, and would not directly mitigate the project's significant freeway impacts
                        associated with contribution of trips equal to or greater than one percent of
                        freeway segment capacity to freeway segments currently operating at LOS
                        F. 3 Rather, the Express Lanes project would simply change drivers' behavior
                        within the current existing freeway capacity. Because the Express Lanes
                        would not provide added freeway capacity, they do not directly mitigate the
                        project's significant freeway impacts. 4

Comment B2:

Traffic Impact Fees
Development plans should require traffic impact fees based on projected traffic and/or based on
associated cost estimates for public transportation facilities necessitated by development. Please
refer to the California Office of Planning and Research (OPR) 2003 General Plan Guidelines, page
163, which can be accessed on-line at the following website:
http://www.opr.ca.gov/index.php?a=planning/gpg.html.

Scheduling and costs associated with planned improvements on Departmental right-of-way should be
listed, in addition to identifying viable funding sources correlated to the pace of improvements for
roadway improvements, if any.

Response B2:            The comment is acknowledged. The project would not result in any local
                        intersection impacts, and the project's significant effects would be limited to
                        mainline freeway impacts. There is no justification for the project to pay into
                        the program described above, since the fees could not be directed towards
                        improvements (i.e., freeway widening) that would be considered mitigation
                        under CEQA (CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.4(a)(4)(A),(B)). Please also
                        refer to Response B1 and Appendix A.

C.      RESPONSE TO COMMENT LETTER C FROM THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY
        TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY (VTA), DATED DECEMBER 21, 2012.

Comment C1: Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) staff have reviewed the Draft
EIR (DEIR) for 385,510 square feet of office space on 8.0 acres at 625-685 Clyde Avenue. We have
the following comments.

Freeway Ramp Capacity Analysis
VTA recommends reviewing the traffic impact for freeway on-ramp storage capacity to address any
queuing impacts to on-ramps as well as freeway traffic operations. Ramp metering is operational on
the freeway on-ramps in the project area.

Response C1:            The Draft EIR (pages 44-45) uses VTA CMP thresholds of significance for
                        freeway impact analyses. The VTA's TIA guidelines do not specify a
                        threshold for ramp metering operations at the freeway, however, ramp
                        capacity under existing and proposed project conditions is discussed below,
                        and in the revised TIA attached as Appendix B.

                        State Route 237 does not have a ramp-metering system in place, so it appears
                        that the comment refers to ramp metering that is operational to the U.S. 101
                        interchange with Ellis Avenue.

                        The ramp metering system on the southbound US 101 on-ramp at Ellis Street
                        on-ramp is active during the PM peak hour and creates a queue at the on-
                        ramp. Field observations found that the queue was observed to reach slightly
                        over half of the available on-ramp capacity. The left lane is an HOV lane
                        with a metering rate of 900 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl). The right lane
                        is a mixed-flow lane with a minimum metering rate of 240 vphpl and a
                        maximum metering rate of 450 vphpl.

                        The project will add 70 PM peak hour trips to the existing on-ramp demand
                        for a new total of 546 trips. With the existing metering rates, the on-ramp
                        queue is not expected to exceed the existing on-ramp capacity and back onto
                        the local streets.

625-685 Clyde Avenue Office Project                7                                          Final EIR
City of Mountain View                                                                      January 2013
                        The northbound US 101 ramp meters at Ellis Street are inactive during both
                        the morning and evening peak periods; therefore, queuing does not occur.

Comment C2:

Freeway Analysis under Background Conditions
VTA recommends that freeway analysis be included in the background as well as near-term
cumulative analysis that includes expected growth until the project will be available for occupancy.

Response C2:            The VTA's March 2009 Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines (page
                        23), states that "freeway segments do not need to be analyzed under
                        background conditions." Accordingly, the Transportation Impact Analysis,
                        625-685 Clyde Avenue Office Project, prepared by Fehr & Peers, and the
                        transportation impact discussion in the Draft EIR conform to the VTA's
                        Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) Guidelines.

                        In addition, the affected freeway analysis uses the threshold identified in the
                        VTA TIA Guidelines (page 40) for freeway segments at Level of Service
                        (LOS) F. Specifically, the VTA Guidelines state that a project is said to
                        impact a freeway segment determined to have been at LOS F under existing
                        or background conditions, if the number of new trips added by the project is
                        more than one percent of the freeway capacity.

                        The Draft EIR identified significant and unavoidable impacts for six freeway
                        segments where the proposed development would add trips equal to or greater
                        than one percent of the freeway segment's capacity. These six freeway
                        segments are already at LOS F under existing conditions. Therefore,
                        providing a background or cumulative scenario would not change the
                        outcome of the analysis, because freeway impacts were already found
                        significant and unavoidable because the proposed development would add
                        trips equal to or greater than one percent to the freeway segment's capacity.

                        Finally, completing a background scenario for freeway impacts would require
                        a list of approved projects for multiple jurisdictions in several counties. Each
                        of these numerous jurisdictions would need to be contacted individually for
                        lists of approved projects, as no regional agency provides such a database, so
                        establishing a credible Background scenario for freeway impacts is
                        problematic. The cumulative analysis completed for the Draft EIR analyzes
                        traffic under a near-term analysis (project occupancy), but does not attempt to
                        predict the cumulative freeway volumes for the same reason background
                        volumes are not included in freeway analysis, i.e., the regional nature of
                        freeway volumes and difficulty in establishing a credible background
                        scenario.

Comment C3:

Project Trip Generation
ITE Trip Generation 8th edition has been used to calculated the trip generation rates and estimates.
The 9th edition is available and has slightly higher rates when compared to the 8th edition. VTA
recommends using the latest Trip generation manual.

Response C3:            The comment is acknowledged. Per the CEQA Guidelines Section 15125 (a),
                        "an EIR must include a description of the physical environmental conditions
                        in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of preparation
                        is published, or if no notice of preparation is published, at the time the
                        environmental analysis is commenced, from both a local and regional
                        perspective."

                        The Notice of Preparation for the 625-685 Clyde Avenue Office Project was
                        circulated from August 2 to August 31, 2012, prior to the publication of the
                        ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition in September 2012. Despite the fact
                        that the 9th Edition of this manual is now available, the 8th Edition remains a
                        valid method for calculating the project trips for the traffic analysis.

Comment C4:

Transportation Demand Management Plan
VTA commends the project applicant for including a Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
Plan (Appendix D of the DEIR) committing "the applicant and future tenant(s)" (p. i) to specific
measures designed to reduce single-occupant automobile trips to the site by 15%. VTA is pleased to
see measures such as VTA Eco Pass, bicycle facilities and carpool programs included in the TDM
Plan, as well as an annual monitoring component. VTA recommends that the City include the TDM
Plan as a Condition of Approval for the project. VTA also recommends that the Condition of
Approval include a provision requiring the project to provide the VTA Eco Pass, or an equivalent
transit subsidy (for example, Caltrain Go Pass), on an ongoing basis.

Response C4:            The Transportation Demand Management Plan, including a provision
                        requiring the VTA Eco Pass will be required by the City of Mountain View as
                        a Condition of Approval for the project. Additional TDM measures required
                        as project Conditions of Approval include:

                           65 long-term and 13 short-term bicycle storage spaces,
                           install bike "FIXIT" stations near bike storage facilities with repair tools
                            and instructions,
                           purchase and maintain bicycles for employee use to access transit and
                            local amenities,
                           showers and changing rooms,

Comment C5:

Pedestrian Accommodations and Access to Transit
VTA commends the project for including analysis and the figure showing walking routes to transit in
the TIA (p. 14 and Figure 5). The TIA notes that the Middlefield station is approximately 4,800 feet
walking distance from the project site and the Bayshore/NASA station is approximately 2,500 feet
walking distance from the project site, based on the shortest safe walking routes available.

VTA encourages the City to identify ways to improve or shorten the walking route to both nearby
light rail stations. VTA is aware that the City of Mountain View has initiated the "NASA Ames
Bayshore Light Rail Station Pedestrian Access Study" to evaluate options for connecting this station
to areas south of US 101, and we would be happy to discuss access improvement options with the
study team at the appropriate time. VTA also encourages the City to work with property owners to
close the sidewalk gaps on Clyde Avenue and Logue Avenue, and look into the feasibility of
establishing a pedestrian connection between Clyde Court and the end of Logue Avenue, which
could shorten the walking distance to the Middlefield LRT Station by up to 2,000 feet (2,800 vs.
4,800).

Response C5:            The City of Mountain View appreciates the VTA's assistance with the
                        enhancement of pedestrian and transit improvements in the City. The City of
                        Mountain View will continue to work with property owners to provide
                        pedestrian, bicycle, and transit connections in the East Whisman area and
                        throughout the City.

                        In regards to the proposed project, the City cannot require the project
                        applicant as a condition of approval to obtain pedestrian right-of-way from
                        Clyde Court to Logue Avenue across private property not under the
                        applicant's control. The applicant, however, will be contributing funds to the
                        City for future pedestrian and bicycle improvements in the East Whisman
                        area at a rate of $3.62 per square foot for new floor area. In addition, the

                        applicant will construct missing sidewalks on Clyde Avenue and provide a
                        pedestrian mid-block crossing and a second pedestrian crossing at the
                        driveway entrance and intersection of Clyde Avenue and Fairchild Drive to
                        improve pedestrian access.

                        Finally, the applicant will also provide trail improvements to the Hetch-
                        Hetchy Trail between Ellis Street and the Light Rail Trail, which leads to the
                        Middlefield Light Rail Station.

Comment C6:

Freeway Analysis - Significant Impacts
The TIA finds significant impacts based on VTA impact criteria on six freeway segments that are
operating at LOS F near the site (p. 29):

       SR 85 between EI Camino Real and SR 237 (Southbound, Mixed-Flow, PM Peak Hour)
       US 101 between Mathilda Ave. and SR 237 (Northbound, Mixed-Flow, AM Peak Hour)
       US 101 between SR 237 and Moffett Blvd. (Northbound, Mixed-Flow, AM Peak Hour)
       US 101 between SR 237 and Moffett Blvd. (Northbound, Mixed-Flow, PM Peak Hour)
       SR 237 between SR 85 and Central Expwy. (Eastbound, AM Peak Hour)
       SR 237 between Maude Ave. and Central Expwy. (Westbound, PM Peak Hour)

The TIA concludes that "The mitigation of freeway impacts is considered beyond the scope of an
individual development project, due to the inability of any individual project or City to acquire right
of way for freeway widening. Freeway improvements also would require approval by Caltrans,
which neither the project applicant nor the City can guarantee. Therefore, the addition of project
traffic results in a significant and unavoidable impact to the identified freeway segments" (p. 30).

VTA recommends that, as a mitigation and avoidance measure, the project applicant should provide
a fair share contribution towards roadway improvement projects that has been identified in the
adopted countywide transportation plan, Valley Transportation Plan 2035. VTA has legislation
authority to implement and operation Express Lanes in these two corridors, SR237 and SR85/US
101. They are considered the highest priority Express Lanes projects in Santa Clara County and
VTA is actively working on the development of these projects. These Express Lanes projects
maximize the efficiency of the existing highways, which serves as a gateway to the project. VTA
recommends that the applicant make a fair share contribution these projects since the proposed
project will have significant impacts on all three highways.

Thank you for the opportunity to review this project. If you have any questions, please call me at
(408) 321-5784.

Response C6:            Please refer to Response B1, above and Appendix A. Fees provided toward
                        the identified regional improvements would fund worthwhile and necessary
                        highway improvements, but would not be applicable as project mitigation
                        measures under CEQA.

City of Mountain View                                                                       January 2013
                        As noted in Response B1, the Express Lane projects would not increase
                        freeway mainline capacity.

                        Therefore, the Express Lane projects would not change the results of the
                        freeway analysis set forth in Section 3.2.2.5 of the Draft EIR. Additionally,
                        the Express Lanes projects would not directly mitigate freeway impacts of the
                        project found to be significant because the proposed development is projected
                        to add trips equal to or greater than one percent of the freeway segment's
                        capacity to freeway segments currently operating at LOS F.

                        measures shall be implemented:

                        Fencing shall be installed around the trees to be retained prior to the arrival of
                        vehicles and equipment and shall remain in place during the entire
                        construction period. Fencing must enclose a sufficient portion of the root
                        zone. Fencing will encircle the existing planter beds containing the coast
                        redwoods and Italian stone pine trees. Fencing on the east side of the
                        property near the golf course shall be located at the edge of existing paving.
                        Fencing shall consist of chain-link fencing with a minimum height of six feet.
                        The steel fence posts shall be driven approximately two feet into the soil and
                        must be located no further than 10 feet apart.

                        Irrigation of Trees to be Retained: All preserved trees shall be irrigated
                        throughout the entire construction period during the dry months
                        (approximately May through October). A soaker hose or a drip line shall be
                        used to irrigate a minimum of 10 gallons for each inch of trunk diameter
                        every two weeks. The sprinkler irrigation must not be designed to strike the
                        trunks of trees. Landscape irrigation trenches must be located a minimum
                        distance of 10 times the trunk diameter from the trunks of protected trees.

The site is within the planning area for Moffett Federal Airfield, as described in the Administrative
Final Draft Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) prepared by the Santa Clara County Airport Land
Use Commission (ALUC) in August 2011November 2012, and adopted on November 28, 2012. As
of the date of this EIR, CEQA review of the Moffett Federal Airfield CLUP has not been completed,
and the final CLUP has not been adopted. However, bBecause the site is located within the Airport
Influence Area identified in the Administrative Draftadopted CLUP, the proposed project will be
submitted for was subject to review by the Santa Clara County Airport Land Use Commission.

Page 101-102:        REVISE Section 3.9.3.2, Airport Safety, as shown.

The proposed six- to seven-story buildings on the project site could pose a hazard to aviation due to
potential conflicts with flight arrivals and departures from the adjacent Moffett Federal Airfield. The
project applicant has applied for and been issued Federal Aviation Administration "Determination of
No Hazard to Air Navigation," for each of the four proposed buildings, based on aeronautical studies
completed under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 77. These studies are attached to
this document as Appendix H. Based on these studies, the proposed project would not result in a
significant impact to the safety of flight operations at Moffett Federal Airfield, if the conditions of
these studies are met. In addition, the proposed project will be reviewed by the Santa Clara County
Airport Land Use Commission.

Since the site is located within the Airport Influence Area identified in the adopted CLUP, the
proposed project was submitted for review by the Santa Clara County Airport Land Use
Commission. With the project's incorporation of conditions of approval for an acoustical analysis
and noise reduction measures, the proposed project and rezoning was found consistent by the Santa
Clara County Airport Land Use Commission with safety, height, and noise policies for Moffett
Airfield on November 28, 2012. (Refer also to Mitigation Measure MM NOISE-1.1 on page 57 of
the Draft EIR.)

Impact HAZ-1:           The proposed buildings could impact the safety of flight operations at Moffett
                        Federal Airfield. Conformance with the Federal Aviation Administration
                        regulations will reduce airport safety impacts to a less than significant level.

The proposed project would allow for the development of up to 385,510 square feet of office uses on
the site, including two six-story office buildings, one six- and one seven-story parking garage,
surface parking areas, driveways, walkways, and landscaping. The maximum building height of the
proposed six-story office buildings would be approximately 100142 feet to top of the roof screen,
which would be allowed under the proposed zoning designation. The maximum height of the
parking structures would be approximately 80111 feet and 125 feet, respectively. Conceptual
elevations of the proposed buildings are shown on Figures 5 and 6. Although the proposed buildings
would be substantially taller than the existing buildings on the site, the buildings would not be out of
character with the existing office development in the area, in that the vicinity of the project site is
primarily developed with office and light industrial uses. In addition, a number of sites in the East
Whisman area near the project site are being redeveloped with intensive office uses similar to those
being proposed on the project site.

This memorandum was prepared in response to comment letters received on the 625-685 Clyde
Avenue Office Project Draft Environment Impact Report (DEIR) - Transportation and Traffic
Section. The first letter was written by Caltrans and received on December 11, 2012. The second
letter was written by Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) and received on December
21, 2012.

A total of 18 freeway segments were studied in the DEIR and six freeway segments were identified
to have a significant and unavoidable impact due to the project (page 158). In both comment
letters, future planned regional freeway improvements were identified as potential mitigation
solutions. Each freeway improvement was examined to see how they would impact the freeway
analysis.

The proposed regional improvements include:

         US 101 Auxiliary lane Project (SR 85 to Embarcadero Road)
         US 101 Express Lane Project (City of Morgan Hill to San Mateo/Santa Clara County Line)
         SR 85 Express Lane Project (US 101 - City of San Jose to US 101 - City of Mountain View)
         SR 237 Express Lane Project (US 101 to North First Street)

VTA, the congestion management agency for Santa Clara County, defines a project as having a
significant impact on a freeway segment if:

    1.   The addition of project traffic causes the operating level of a freeway segment to
         deteriorate from LOS E (or better) under Existing Conditions to LOS F; or
    2.   The number of new trips added by a project to a segment already operating at LOS F
         under Existing Conditions is more than one percent of the freeway segment capacity.

All six freeway impacts were identified based on the second criteria. Therefore, physical
improvements that increase the capacity of the study freeway segments could potentially mitigate
the impacts.

According to the VTA Valley Transportation Plan 2035, the US 101 Auxiliary Lane Project will add
an auxiliary lane between SR 85 and Embarcadero Road. However, this improvement falls outside
of the project study area and will not directly mitigate the freeway impact segments. Furthermore,
Section 2.2.2 of the VTA Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines states that auxiliary lanes "shall
not be considered" for the purpose of calculating a freeway segment capacity. Therefore, the
installation of a new auxiliary lane will not change the results of the freeway analysis.

The US 101, SR 85, and SR 237 Express Lane programs consist of converting the existing High
Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes to high-performance express lanes. The programs will allow single
occupancy vehicles to utilize the express lane by paying a toll to alleviate the existing congestions
on the mixed flow lanes. However, the programs do not increase freeway capacity because no
additional lanes are added. Thus, the Express Lane programs will not change the results of the
freeway analysis or serve as direct mitigation of the project impacts.

While the regional projects identified by Caltrans and VTA will provide operational benefits within
the respective corridors, they would not change the freeway analysis or serve as direct mitigation
of the project's freeway impacts.        Therefore, the freeway impacts remain significant and
unavoidable.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed re-
development of 625-685 Clyde Avenue in the City of Mountain View, CA. Four buildings totaling 118,080
square feet of active office uses currently occupy the Project site. The existing buildings would be
demolished and two new 192,755 square-foot buildings would be constructed, totaling 385,510 square-
feet of development, a net increase of approximately 267,430 square feet of office space. Two parking
structures and surface parking, with a total of 1,297 on-site parking spaces, would be provided.

The impacts of the proposed project to the surrounding transportation system were evaluated following
the guidelines of the City of Mountain View and the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), the congestion
management agency for Santa Clara County. The operations of 11 intersections along the access routes to
the site were evaluated with level of service calculations during the weekday morning (AM) and evening
(PM) peak periods for Existing, Background, Cumulative Conditions., without and with the Project.



PROJECT TRIP ESTIMATES

Project trip generation was estimated using rates in the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip
Generation (8th Edition) land use number 710 (office). The amount of traffic generated by the proposed
office development was estimated by applying rates to the total size of the proposed project. The existing
buildings are currently 100 percent occupied. No trip reductions for transit proximity were applied per
VTA guidelines.

The proposed project is expected to generate approximately 2,616 net new daily trips, 383 net new AM
peak hour trips (337 inbound and 46 outbound) and 354 net new PM peak hour trips (60 inbound and
294 outbound).



ROADWAY OPERATIONS AND IMPACTS

Level of Service (LOS) results for all study intersections are presented in Tables ES-1, ES-2 and ES-3 for
the Existing, Background and Cumulative condition, respectively. As shown, all of the study intersections
are projected to operate at LOS D or better during both peak hours without and with the Project. As LOS
D is considered acceptable for intersection operations in the City of Mountain View, the proposed project
would have a less-than-significant project impact to study intersections.



                                                                                                         i

FREEWAY IMPACTS

As presented in Table ES-4, the proposed project would have a significant impact based on VTA impact
criteria on six freeway segments that are operating at LOS F near the site.         Implementation of a
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program could incrementally reduce Project traffic volumes
on freeway segments accessing the site; however, a detailed analysis of a project specific TDM program is
needed to determine the effectiveness of a TDM program.           The mitigation of freeway impacts is
considered beyond the scope of an individual development project, thus, the addition of project traffic
would result in a significant and unavoidable impact.



SITE ACCESS AND ON-SITE CIRCULATION

The proposed project is located on Clyde Avenue with two full access driveways serving the site. Based
on our assessment of driveway operations, this level of access should be sufficient to accommodate traffic
generated by the development without significantly degrading the existing roadway operations.

A combination of surface and structured parking is proposed to accommodate the parking demand for
site users. The surface parking lots would be linked and accessible from each other, thus avoiding dead
ends and the need for turnaround areas. In addition, two parking garages would be provided, each with
one ingress/egress access entrance. The garage entrances are expected to have open access with no
manual or gated regulations to avoid potential queuing on-site.



PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE, AND TRANSIT IMPACTS

Existing sidewalks are provided along the project's frontage on Clyde Avenue. Two midblock crosswalks
are proposed from the main building entrances to cross Clyde Avenue. In-pavement flashers are
recommended for the midblock crosswalks to enhance crossing safety. A pedestrian plaza would be
constructed to connect the two office buildings without exposing pedestrian to vehicular traffic.
Pedestrian pathways will be provided to connect the office buildings to their adjacent parking garages.

Bike lanes are provided on Ellis Street south of US 101, Maude Avenue east of SR 237, Middlefield Road,
and Whisman Road near the project site. While Clyde Avenue is not a designated bike facility, the low
peak-hour roadway volumes plus wide travel lanes should not discourage potential bicyclists generated




                                                                                                          ii

by the project. These bicycle facilities would be maintained under Existing plus Project Conditions. Bicycle
racks or lockers would be provided on-site next to the building entrances to accommodate bicycle travel.

VTA allows a maximum of three (3) percent transit trip reduction if a commercial project entrance is
located within 2,000 feet walking distance to a light rail or Caltrain station. The walking distance from the
project site to the nearest light rail station is greater than 2,000 feet and thus no transit reduction was
taken. While a transit reduction was not applied for this project, the project could potentially generate up
to 11 (10 inbound and 1 outbound) morning and 11 (2 inbound and 9 outbound) evening new transit
trips based on three percent of the expected project's trip generation.

The project's impact on pedestrian, bicycle and transit system is considered less-than-significant.



PARKING

The project would provide 1,297 parking spaces, including 23 ADA parking spaces, 3 of which are van
spaces. The proposed number of parking spaces would satisfy the City of Mountain View Zoning
Ordinance and Section the California Building Code parking requirements for office uses.

In addition, the Project proposes to provide 65 Class I bike lockers and 13 Class II bike racks for a total of
78 bicycle parking facilities.

1. INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) conducted for the proposed
office redevelopment at 625-685 Clyde Avenue in the City of Mountain, California. This chapter discusses
the TIA purpose, analysis methods, criteria used to identify significant impacts, and report organization.



STUDY PURPOSE

The study purpose is to evaluate the transportation impacts for the proposed redevelopment of the 8.8
acre parcel at 625-685 Clyde Avenue, as shown on Figure 1 (Project). The site is west of the Sunnyvale
Municipal Golf Course, east and north of Clyde Avenue, and south of U.S. 101 within the East Whisman
area of the City, an area of predominantly office and light-industrial uses. Four existing one-story office
buildings totaling 118,000 square feet (s.f.) would be demolished and replaced by two 6-story 192,755 s.f.
buildings, increasing office uses on the site by 267,430 s.f. The project would include one six-level and one
seven-level parking structure, in addition to surface parking. Two driveways on Clyde Avenue would serve
the site. Public transportation is available via the Bayshore/NASA Light Rail Station located to the north of
the project site across US 101. A conceptual Project site plan is shown on Figure 2.

This study addresses the Project's impacts on the roadway system under three scenarios and discusses the
adjacent bicycle, pedestrian, and transit network. Project impacts were evaluated following the guidelines
of the City of Mountain View and the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), the congestion management
agency for Santa Clara County. A site plan review was also conducted.

PROJECT STUDY AREA

STUDY INTERSECTIONS

Project impacts on the study area roadway facilities were determined by measuring the effect Project
traffic would have on intersections in the vicinity of the site during the morning (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and
evening (4:00 to 6:00 PM) peak periods. The following intersections, as shown previously on Figure 1,
were selected as study locations in consultation with City of Mountain View staff based on VTA's
Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines 1, 2 ("VTA Guidelines"; March, 2009).

FREEWAY SEGMENTS

The study freeway segments were selected in consultation with the City of Mountain View and finalized
based on VTA Guidelines 3. The analysis evaluated the operations of the following segments:




1 The jurisdiction charged with maintaining each study intersection is shown in parentheses after the intersection name. The
following jurisdictions are shown: (CMP) VTA Congestion Management Program intersection; (MV) City of Mountain View.
2 Study intersections were identified using VTA Guidelines for choosing study intersections. Based on Section 2.2 of the VTA
Guidelines: "A CMP intersection shall be included in a TIA if...the proposed development project is expected to add 10 or more peak
hour vehicles per lane to any intersection movement. The 10 or more vehicles per lane requirement applies to any intersection
movement (left turn, through or right turn). If a movement uses a shared lane, the shared lane shall be considered a full lane for
these calculation purposes."
3 Study freeway segments were identified using VTA Guidelines. Based on Section 2.2 of the VTA Guidelines: "A freeway segment
shall be included in a TIA if...the proposed development project is expected to add traffic equal to at least one percent of the
freeway segment's capacity."

INTERSECTION ANALYSIS SCENARIOS

The study intersections were evaluated during the AM peak-hour occurring between 7:00 to 9:00 am and
PM peak-hour occurring between 4:00 to 6:00 pm for the following scenarios:

    Scenario 1: Existing Conditions  Existing volumes obtained from existing/new traffic counts.

    Scenario 2: Existing with Project Conditions  Existing volumes plus traffic generated by the proposed
                   project.

    Scenario 3: Background Conditions  Existing volumes plus traffic from approved but not yet
                   constructed and occupied developments in the area.

    Scenario 4: Background with Project Conditions  Background volumes plus traffic generated by the
                   proposed project.

    Scenario 5: Cumulative without Project Conditions  Background volumes plus traffic generated from
                   pending developments. A growth factor may be applied to the existing counts to
                   account for regional growth.

TRAFFIC ANALYSIS METHODS

The operations of roadway facilities are described with the term level of service (LOS), a qualitative
description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six
levels are defined from LOS A, as the best operating conditions, to LOS F, or the worst operating
conditions. LOS E represents "at capacity" operations. When traffic volumes exceed the intersection
capacity, stop-and-go conditions result, and operations are designated as LOS F.


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

The level of service method approved by VTA, and adopted by the City of Mountain View, for signalized
intersections is the method described in Chapter 16 of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) (Special
Report 209, Transportation Research Board ) with adjusted saturation flow rates to reflect conditions in
Santa Clara County. This method evaluates signalized intersection operations on the average control
vehicular delay.

Control delay includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and acceleration
delay. The average control delay for signalized intersections is calculated using TRAFFIX 8.0 analysis
software and is correlated to a LOS designation as shown in Table 1. The LOS standard (i.e., minimum
acceptable operations) for signalized intersections in the City of Mountain View is LOS D.


UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

Operations of the unsignalized study intersections are evaluated using the method contained in Chapter
17 of the 2000 HCM and calculated using the TRAFFIX analysis software. LOS ratings for stop-sign
controlled intersections are based on the average control delay expressed in seconds per vehicle. At two-
way or side-street-stop controlled intersections, control delay is calculated for each stop-controlled
movement, not for the intersection as a whole. For approaches composed of a single lane, delay is
computed as the average of all movements in that lane. For all-way stop-controlled locations, a weighted
average delay for the entire intersection is presented. Table 2 summarizes the relationship between delay
and LOS for unsignalized intersections.

                 Progression is extremely favorable and most vehicles arrive during the green phase.
      A            Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low            < 10.0
                                                        delay.

                 Progression is good, cycle lengths are short, or both. More vehicles stop than with
      B                                                                                                    > 10.0 to 20.0
                                   LOS A, causing higher levels of average delay.

                  Higher congestion may result from fair progression, longer cycle lengths, or both.
      C           Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level, though many still pass      > 20.0 to 35.0
                                       through the intersection without stopping.

                   The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result
                 from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, or high V/C
      D                                                                                                    > 35.0 to 55.0
                   ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines.
                                        Individual cycle failures are noticeable.

                 This level is considered by many agencies to be the limit of acceptable delay. These
      E           high delay values generally indicate poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high      > 55.0 to 80.0
                              V/C ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.

                 This level is considered unacceptable with oversaturation, which is when arrival flow
                 rates exceed the capacity of the intersection. This level may also occur at high V/C
      F                                                                                                        > 80.0
                   ratios below 1.0 with many individual cycle failures. Poor progression and long
                          cycle lengths may also be contributing factors to such delay levels.

FREEWAY SEGMENTS

Freeway segments are evaluated using VTA Guidelines analysis procedure, which is based on the density
of the traffic flow using methods described in the 2000 HCM. Density is expressed in passenger cars per
mile per lane. The Congestion Management Program range of densities for freeway segment level of
service is shown in Table 3. The VTA Guidelines' standard for the freeway segments is LOS E.

A significant project impact to a signalized intersection occurs if the project results in one of the following:

        Causes a signalized City of Mountain View intersection to deteriorate from acceptable LOS D
         conditions or better to unacceptable LOS E or F conditions, or
        Causes a signalized City of Mountain View intersection currently operating at LOS E or F
         conditions to increase in critical movement delay of four (4) seconds or more, and increase in the
         critical volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio by 0.01 or more,




                                                                                                                               8

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTION IMPACT CRITERIA

Level of service analysis at unsignalized intersections is generally used to determine the need for
modifying intersection control type (i.e. all-way stop or signalization). A signal warrant would be evaluated
to determine if modifying intersection control type is appropriate if the existing intersection control
degrades below acceptable LOS.

The City has generally used a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D for unsignalized intersections.
Significant impacts are defined to occur when the addition of project traffic degrades to LOS E or LOS F
and the intersection satisfies the peak hour signal warrants from the 2012 California Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (CA MUTCD).



FREEWAY IMPACT CRITERIA

The CMP defines a project as having a significant impact on a freeway segment if:

    1.   The addition of project traffic causes the operating level of a freeway segment to deteriorate from
         LOS E (or better) under Existing Conditions to LOS F; or
    2.   The number of new trips added by a project to a segment already operating at LOS F under
         Existing Conditions is more than one percent of the freeway segment capacity.




REPORT ORGANIZATION

The remainder of this report is divided into four additional chapters.

        Chapter 2  Existing Conditions describes the transportation system in the Project vicinity,
         including the surrounding roadway network, morning and evening peak period driveway and
         intersection turning movement volumes, existing bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities, and
         intersection and roadway segment levels of service.
        Chapter 3  Existing plus Project Traffic Conditions addresses the existing condition plus the
         Project, and discusses Project vehicular impacts. The relevant Project information, such as the
         Project components and Project trip generation, distribution, and assignment is also discussed in
         this chapter. A discussion of site access and circulation is also provided in this chapter.



                                                                                                             9

       Chapter 4  Background Traffic Conditions addresses the near-term conditions, both without
        and with the Project, and discusses Project vehicular impacts.
       Chapter 5  Cumulative Traffic Conditions addresses the longer term conditions, both without
        and with the Project, and discusses Project vehicular impacts.




                                                                                                     10

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS

This chapter discusses the existing roadway network and operations of the study intersections, freeway
segments, and a discussion of the existing bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities located in the project
study area. This chapter also includes a discussion of the existing intersection and freeway segment LOS
results.



EXISTING TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES

EXISTING STREET SYSTEM

Regional access to the site is provided via US 101, State Route (SR) 85, and SR 237. Local access to the site
is provided via Ellis Street, Middlefield Road, Maude Avenue, and Clyde Avenue. Descriptions of the
existing roadways are provided below:

US 101 is a north-south, eight-lane freeway with one lane designated as a high occupancy vehicle (HOV)
lane and three mixed-flow lanes in each direction. HOV lanes, also known as diamond or carpool lanes,
are restricted for use by vehicles occupied by two or more person or motorcycles between 5:00 and 9:00
am and between 3:00 and 7:00 pm. HOVs include carpools, vanpools, and buses. The freeway extends
from San Francisco, in the north, to beyond San Jose, in the south. In the vicinity of the site, US 101 runs in
a west to east direction and is located north of the site. Access from US 101 to the project site is provided
via interchanges at Ellis Street and SR 237.

SR 85 is primarily a six-lane facility including an HOV lane in each direction during the commute hours.
Access to the site from SR 85 is via interchanges at SR 237 or US 101.

SR 237 is a four-lane freeway near the project site. SR 237 generally runs in an east-west direction and
extends eastward from El Camino Real through Sunnyvale and north San Jose to I-880. Access to the
project site is provided via an urban interchange at Maude Avenue or the interchange with US 101.

Middlefield Road is a four-lane, east-west 35 miles per hour (mph) arterial with bike lanes and
painted/landscaped median. Middlefield Road extends west from Central Expressway past SR 85. On-
street parking is not permitted.




                                                                                                            11

Ellis Street is a four-lane, north-south 40 mph roadway with bike lanes and median. It extends from E
Middlefield Road to Macon Road, a block north of US 101. Access to the project site is provided via
Fairchild Drive, which turns in to Clyde Avenue. On-street parking is not permitted.

Maude Avenue is a two-lane, east-west 25 mph roadway between Logue Avenue and SR-237 and a four-
lane, 35 mph roadway east of SR-237. It extends from N Fair Oaks Avenue in the east, west where it
terminates at Logue Avenue. Access to the site is provided at the intersection of W Maude Avenue and
Clyde Avenue. On-street parking is permitted west of SR-237.

Clyde Avenue is a two-lane north-south 25 mph roadway. It extends north from W Maude Avenue where it
turns into Fairchild Drive. Clyde Avenue provides access to the project site via two driveways, one at the
north and south section of the project site. On-street parking is permitted.


EXISTING PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES

Pedestrian facilities are comprised of sidewalks, crosswalks, and off-street paths. In the vicinity of the
project site, sidewalks are provided along the project parcels on both sides of Clyde Avenue. On other
sections of Clyde Avenue, approximately 275 feet of sidewalks are missing on both sides of the street
north of Maude Avenue. No sidewalk is available on the northern side of Clyde Avenue between Ellis
Street and the start of the project site. A sidewalk is provided on the north side of Maude Avenue but
missing on the majority of the south side of Maude Avenue. Sidewalks are provided on both sides of Ellis
Street and East Middlefield Road.

There are crosswalks on the west and south leg of the Fairchild Drive and Ellis Street intersection. There is
a crosswalk on the north leg of the Clyde Avenue and W Maude Avenue intersection. There is a mid-block
pedestrian crosswalk on Clyde Avenue south of the project site location. The existing pedestrian facilities
are shown on Figure 3.


EXISTING BICYCLE FACILITIES

Bikeway planning and design in California typically relies on guidelines and design standards established
by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) in the Highway Design Manual (Chapter 1000:
Bikeway Planning and Design). Bicycle facilities are comprised of paths (Class I), lanes (Class II), and routes
(Class III), as described below and shown on the accompanying figures. Figure 4 presents existing bicycle
facilities in the study area.

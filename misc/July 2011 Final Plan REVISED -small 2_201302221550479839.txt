"In 10 to 15 years, Sudley Road will
be an aesthetically-pleasing gateway to
the City of Manassas with an eclectic
mix of growth in business, residential,
religious, and hospital-related areas; it
will be buffered by an environmentally
unique, green setting that provides an
essential gateway link to the Old Town
Manassas area, and safely beckons
pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles
alike."

                   Growth has occurred rapidly in the City of Manassas, Virginia since
                   the late 1990's, and with it, the development of over ninety percent
                   of the City. In 2002, the City adopted the 2002 Comprehensive
                   Plan to guide and sustain growth in the area, and, in 2008, initiated
                   the Manassas Next ­ 2030 Comprehensive Plan process. The 2002
                   Comprehensive Plan designated six study areas within the City of
                   Manassas, which included the Prince William Hospital System
                   Campus and Sudley Road Study Area (also referred to as Study Area
                   1). For this sector area, the 2002 Comprehensive Plan envisioned a
                   strong, regional hospital system and support services; Sudley Road
                   as a well-maintained road complete with sidewalks, landscaping and

Sudley Road,       Sudley Road, as it is known today, has existed since before the Civil
                   War and once served as the major northern route to Sudley Springs
as it is known     and Catharpin. Prior to the construction of the Prince William
today, has         Hospital in 1964, there was no major development north of Grant

before the Civil   churches were constructed along Sudley Road. Additionally, the
War...             existing residential communities surrounding this area continued to
                   develop well into the 1960s. Today, Sudley Road serves as a gateway
                   to the City of Manassas.

                   The Sudley Road corridor has traditionally remained a commercial/
                   retail corridor that is supported not only by the hospital, but by a

                   William Hospital has expanded several times to provide additional
                   medical services and stay competitive in a growing healthcare market.
                   In late 2009, the Prince William Hospital merged with Novant

                   Novant-Prince William Hospital team is in the process of completing
                   a master plan for the Prince William Hospital, concurrent with this
                   sector planning process, which will likely include future plans for
                   hospital expansion and provision of services.

these attributes may or may not respond to future change in the area.
Moving forward, the CAC and a small group of stakeholders took
part in a visioning process, during which participants circled, on maps,
portions of the sector area that they felt are likely to change, areas
that are not likely to change, and areas that are not likely to change
in the future, but should. This exercise helped the CAC to further

sector area, and facilitated the development of the following goals
for redevelopment of the area:
1. Improve safety and accessibility for both pedestrians and
   bicyclists throughout the sector area.
2. Create a boulevard feel along Sudley Road that serves as an
   appropriate gateway into the City of Manassas.
3. Create design guidelines for redevelopment that enhance the
   visual appeal of the area through future development and
   redevelopment projects.
4. Explore ways to minimize the visual impacts of the transmission

Following the analysis of existing conditions in the sector area, and

future development, the consultants presented two draft land use
concepts to the CAC; the Boulevard Approach (Figure 2 - Boulevard
Approach) and the Villages Concept (Figure 3 - Villages Concept).
The former concept emphasized concentrating new development
along Sudley Road and upgrading Sudley Road to a "grand boulevard."
The latter concept addressed smaller, village-type communities, both
on Sudley Road and along the adjoining streets.

Both of these concepts emphasized mixed-use development of
varying intensities. The CAC provided feedback on these concepts,
which the consultants incorporated into the consolidated concept
and presented to the committee in late 2009.

                 miles north of the City limits (Figure 4 - Existing Circulation). Sudley
                 Road is a four-lane, divided, arterial road with a raised median that
                 ranges in width from four feet at intersections with left-turn lanes, to
                 40 feet at the northern end of the study corridor. The Sudley Road
                 corridor is a little less than one and a half miles long, and extends
                 from Godwin Drive to the north, to Grant Avenue to the south.
                 The segment of Sudley Road within the study area is considered a
                 principal arterial roadway that serves the Prince William Hospital and

...key           Other key roadways in the sector area include Godwin Drive, an
                 arterial roadway that runs along the western boundary of the City
roadways         and joins Sudley Road north of the City; major secondary roads:
in the sector    Stonewall Road and Grant Avenue; and key east-west arteries: Rolling

                 direction along Sudley Road, from Godwin Drive to Grant Avenue.

                 Peak hour turning movement counts were collected at seven
                 signalized intersections, including Sudley Road at Godwin Drive,
                 Sudley Road at Rolling Road, Sudley Road at Dorsey Circle, Sudley
                 Road at Plantation Lane, Sudley Road at Stonewall Road, Sudley
                 Road at Grant Avenue, and Sudley Road at Digges Road. These
                 turning movement counts were taken between the hours of 6:00 AM
                 and 9:00 AM, and 4:00 PM and 7:00 PM, during a period of ten days,
                 from October 21, 2008 to October 30, 2008. Additionally, pedestrian
                 and bicycle counts were taken across intersection legs. Travel lane

each direction of travel on Sudley Road appeared to be relatively
balanced, volumes were slightly higher in the northbound direction
during the AM peak period and in the southbound direction during
the PM peak period. These volumes are likely attributable to the
number of City residents who commute north to I-66 in the morning
and return home in the southbound direction in the evening. The

                              Crash data was provided by the City of Manassas to obtain an
                              overview of the safety conditions along the corridor. For a period of
                              three years, from October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2008, a total
                              of 225 accidents were recorded along Sudley Road, from Godwin
                              Drive to Grant Avenue. The data shows that the highest number
                              of crashes occurred at the Grant Avenue intersection, followed by
                              the Stonewall Road and Plantation Lane intersections, with 33 and
                              31 accidents, respectively. The majority of accidents were caused by
                              drivers failing to yield at the right-of-way, typically resulting in angle
                              or left-turn crashes. The severity of these accidents could not be
                              determined.

   Many people use the parking lots of churches within the study
   area for cut-through access and turnaround space.
   The change in nature and character of development from the
   north end of the sector boundary to the City boundary to the
   south is noteworthy.
   A majority of churches within the study area would like to expand
   their services and facilities to meet the needs of their growing
   congregations, and to accommodate other public uses.

   schools and churches to the south, is worsening.
   The sector area lacks continuous sidewalks along Sudley Road
   and on many side/secondary roads.
   Signalized timing at intersections along Sudley Road is often too
   short to cross this road safely.
   There is a desire for more pedestrian mobility in the study area.
   Many people would like more upscale restaurants along Sudley
   Road.
   As development in the area occurs, additional buffers will be
   needed between residential and commercial development.
   The preference for vertical development would be for a structure
   lower, rather than higher, in height.
   Many drivers, especially truck drivers, use the secondary roads
   surrounding Sudley Road to bypass Sudley Road.
   The City is losing residents and congregations to the Haymarket
   and Gainesville areas.
   There is a desire for the sector to grow commercially, but for
   new development to respect and retain the existing residential
   communities.
   Mixed-use development would be welcome on Sudley Road if it is
   compatible with/buffered from adjacent residential communities.

                  The Sudley Road Sector Plan transforms Sudley Road from a highway
                  to an attractive, walkable boulevard and gateway to the City of
                  Manassas. The sector area becomes a place to live, shop, work, and
                  visit that offers a variety of services, amenities and housing options
                  that both support and complement the Prince William Hospital while
                  improving the quality of life for all residents, employees and visitors.

                  The plan envisions new mixed-use development, concentrated
                  in a boulevard core surrounding the hospital campus, including a

a boulevard       provides new housing options for hospital employees and others
                  who wish to move to the area, while protecting and retaining existing
core...           residences in the sector area. The plan also ensures graceful transitions
                  between these uses through the inclusion of buffer areas between
                  residential and commercial uses and through an appropriate scale of
                  development that respects surrounding neighborhoods.

                  Moreover, the plan improves the quality of the pedestrian environment
                  throughout the sector area. Continuous sidewalks line the Sudley Road
                  boulevard, while safe and convenient pedestrian crossings connect
                  both sides of the boulevard, creating a "park once" environment in
                  which walking becomes a viable mode of transportation for travel
                  between the hospital, area businesses and residential neighborhoods.
                  An expanded network of bicycle routes, including bicycle lanes along
                  the length of Sudley Road, also make the area accessible to bicyclists.
                  The boulevard and new development are tied together by improved
                  street connectivity. The plan reestablishes a street grid in the area
                  by creating a series of new streets while extending and connecting
                  streets that previously terminated in dead-ends or cul-de-sacs.

                    recommendations for the Boulevard Core include the following:

                       Encourage vertical mixed-use development throughout the
                       Boulevard Core, located along the north and south sides of
                       Sudely Road. Horizontal mixed-use could also be acceptable
                       along the Boulevard Core.
                       Along the north side of Sudley Road, between the city line and
                       Digges Road, create mixed-use that faces both Sudley Road and
                       new streets running perpendicular to Sudley Road.
                                                                                        55

        T HE S ECTOR P LAN

     Along the north side of Sudley Road, west of the church yard,
     buildings should front on Sudley Road, Digges Road, and on
     both sides of a new street running perpendicular to Sudley Road.
     Along the north side of Sudley Road, east of the church yard,
     buildings should face Sudley Road, new and existing cross streets,
     including Plantation Lane, Stonewall Road, Forestwood Lane, and
     a new street running parallel to Sudley Road between Plantation
     Lane and Forestwood Lane.
     As part of mixed-use redevelopment on the north side of Sudley

     Establish the existing church yard at Plantation Lane and Sudley
     Road as the visual and physical center of the Boulevard Core,
     protecting this green space while orienting new buildings such
     that they overlook the yard from three sides.

     Sudley Road (between the hospital and the existing church), as
     well as on Digges Road, an extended Champion Court, and a

     Ensure safe pedestrian crossings along the length of Sudley
     Road. Prioritize the installation of "special" crosswalk treatments
     at the intersections of Sudley Road at Digges Road, Sudley Road
     at Plantation Lane, Sudley Road at Rolling Road and Sudley Road

                  The southernmost mixed-use area, located adjacent to the hospital
                  campus and west of Digges Road, includes a variety of uses that are
                  oriented toward hospital activities, hospital employees and visitors,
                  and medical services. Mixed-use structures are located closest to the
                  hospital campus, while adjacent, medium-density residential uses
                  could include single-family townhouses or age-restricted housing. A
                  new, green buffer along the existing stream corridor separates these
                  uses from the surrounding neighborhood.

                     residential development on the blocks south of an extended
                     Surveyor Court. Mixed-use development should be located
                     on the block closest to the hospital, with development facing
                     Digges Road, Surveyor Court and a new street running parallel
                     to Surveyor Court along the northern edge of the existing green
                     space.
                     Consider the possibility of locating a hotel, to serve hospital

                           coordinated and updated furnishings such as benches, trashcans
                           and lighting. In addition, Sudley Road itself will become a greener
                           public thoroughfare, with the addition of a planted median, tree-
                           lined streets, and a linear greenway in front of the hospital campus.

                           In addition, the Plan recommends the maintenance of a public trail
                           along the stream corridor that traverses the southern end of the
                           hospital and the Baptist Church sites, or other alternative route which
                           provides a trail connection in this area. This will continue to provide
                           an important open space amenity for Manassas residents, particularly
                           those living in the sector area.

                           Finally, the plan recommends the creation of a new public open
                           space to provide additional community space within the corridor
                           area. Facing onto the north side of Sudley Road, and spanning the
                           space between Plantation and Forestwood Lanes, the plan calls for
                           a new "civic green" which will comprise both lawn and paved areas,
                           and will provide trees, plantings, seating and, possibly, a water feature

to achieve a more pedestrian-friendly environment for the sector area
(Figure 10 - Proposed Circulation). Recommendations include:
     The creation of attractive, comfortable sidewalks along both sides
     of Sudley Road, including continuous street trees, comfortable
     paving, landscaped areas, appropriate pedestrian and vehicular
     lighting, and coordinated street furnishings.
     The creation of attractive and accessible sidewalks along roads
     that adjoin Sudley Road, throughout the sector area.
     Encourage new development up to the sidewalk edge, with
     parking in the rear, in order to provide an attractive and safe
     environment for walking in the mixed-use areas.
     Demarcation of four new special pedestrian crossing areas along
     Sudley Road: at Rolling Road, Stonewall Road, Plantation Lane
     and Digges Road. These intersections will be designed with
     special pavement markings, crossing signals and safe pedestrian
     refuge areas to allow pedestrians to cross calmly and comfortably
     at clearly designated intersections along the corridor.

                   Additional, potential improvements along the corridor are listed

                   6XGOH\ 5RDG DW *RGZLQ 'ULYH

                   Because Godwin Drive experiences long delays from a short green
                   time, optimizing the signal timings would allow the intersection to
                   operate at better levels of service. If, in the future, the Tri-County
                   Parkway is constructed, there may be the need for an interchange.

                   6XGOH\ 5RDG DW 5ROOLQJ 5RDG

                   Because Rolling Road experiences long delays due to relatively short
                   green time, optimizing the signal timing would result in a minor delay
                   reduction; however, additional eastbound and westbound through-
                   lanes would be needed to achieve acceptable levels of service. These
                   additional lanes will require further study by staff at the time of
                   redevelopment.

                   Sudley Road at Dorsey Circle

                   Because the eastbound and westbound approaches (Hospital
                   Way and Dorsey Circle, respectively) experience long delay from a
                   relatively short green time, optimizing the signal timing would help
                   the intersection operate at LOS D or better along all approaches.

                   Sudley Road at Digges Road

                   Because both the eastbound and westbound approaches on Digges
                   Road experience long delays due to short green times, optimizing the
                   signal timing would help the intersection operate at LOS D or better
                   along all approaches.

                   6XGOH\ 5RDG DW 3ODQWDWLRQ /DQH

                   optimizing the signal timing will improve operations at LOS E with

6XGOH\ 5RDG DW 6WRQHZDOO 5RDG

Because both the eastbound and westbound approaches on Stonewall
Road experience long delays from relatively short green time, which
is augmented by the stop-controlled intersection along the service
road east of the signalized intersection on Sudley Road, optimizing
the signal timing will help improve operations. Additional analysis
is needed to further reduce the delay along the service road at this
location.

6XGOH\ 5RDG DW *UDQW $YH

Optimizing the signal timing will help the intersection operate at
LOS C. Because the southbound lane experiences longer delays from
the high rate of right-turns using the shared through/right-turn lane,
providing an exclusive right-turn lane would improve the capacity
for this movement. The delays on the westbound approach, resulting
from a high rate of left-turns, would be improved by providing a
protected left-turn phase.

                          P ARKING

                          The Sector Plan recommends that all new mixed-use development
                          and redevelopment along Sudley Road will have parking lots and/
                          or garages either behind, or to the side of, the buildings fronting on
                          this main thoroughfare. Parking lots and other parking facilities will
                          not be permitted in front of buildings along Sudley Road, in order to
                          reduce the "sea of cars" image of that corridor, and to provide more
                          pedestrian-friendly streets throughout the area.

                          The plan recommends that on-street parking be allowed on all new
                          and existing local streets in the sector area, although such parking will
                          not be allowed on Sudley Road. Townhouse development in the area
                          will have parking off rear alleyways, either in garages or on surface
                          lots.

      within the Sudley   City and the sector area coming from the west. It is recommended
                          that this intersection be upgraded with special planting, lighting and
      Road sector         signage to acknowledge this. From the east, Nelson Park is, in and
      area...             of itself, a landmark gateway into the area, and the upgrading of
                          this park ­ as described above ­ will provide an appropriate gateway

                                               SUMMARY

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current and anticipated future traffic operations along Route
234 Business (Sudley Road) within the limits of the Prince William Hospital Sector in the city of
Manassas, Virginia. As stated in the Manassas Comprehensive Plan, the goals of the sector plan for this
area are to promote appropriate land-use designations that will encourage businesses that will support
the near and long-term expansion plans of the Prince William Health Systems, and to help identify
economically viable business opportunities along the Sudley Road corridor.

This traffic evaluation consists of two phases. Phase 1 is this Existing Conditions report, which identifies
localized areas along the Sudley Road corridor that are experiencing excessive delays and queuing, poor
levels of service, and above-average crash occurrences, as well as locations where pedestrian, bicycle
and transit facilities need improvement. This report includes recommendations for near-term
improvements to address safety and operational deficiencies along the corridor.

Phase 2 is the forthcoming Future Conditions report, which will also identify problem areas along the
Sudley Road corridor based on the anticipated traffic growth (including passenger cars, pedestrians,
bicycles, and transit vehicles). This growth is expected to occur from redevelopment in the study area due
to the implementation of the Hospital Sector Plan. During this phase of the traffic evaluation, RK&K will
develop year 2030 traffic volume forecasts by revising the Prince William County Travel Forecast Model,
incorporating land use and transportation network changes in accordance with the Hospital Sector Plan.
The Future Conditions report will identify potential transportation system improvement options to serve
this new development while providing safe and efficient travel along the Sudley Road corridor.

RK&K evaluated the existing (2008) traffic conditions along Route 234 Business (Sudley Road) from
Godwin Drive (on the north) to Grant Avenue (on the south). The following seven (7) existing intersections
were analyzed to evaluate the existing (2008) traffic conditions in the study area:


        x   Sudley Road at Godwin Drive
                                                            x     Sudley Road at Plantation Lane
        x   Sudley Road at Rolling Road
                                                            x     Sudley Road at Stonewall Road
        x   Sudley Road at Dorsey Circle
                                                            x     Sudley Road at Grant Avenue
        x   Sudley Road at Digges Road



Currently, all intersections in the study area operate at acceptable levels of service (defined in this report
as LOS D or better) under existing year 2008 conditions during the AM and PM peak hours, with the
exception of the intersections of Sudley Road at Plantation Lane and Sudley Road at Grant Avenue,
which are operating at LOS F. This study includes recommendations regarding optimization of signal
timing and changes in lane configuration in order for the currently failing intersections to operate at
acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better).

                                            INTRODUCTION

The City of Manassas has undertaken a study to evaluate the current and anticipated future traffic
operations along Route 234 Business (Sudley Road) within the limits of the Prince William Hospital
Sector The sector plan for this area is intended to reconfigure the land uses along the Sudley Road
corridor to encourage economic development and support the hospital's expansion plans. The goal of the
traffic study is to identify problem areas and suggest near and long-term improvements that will provide
safe and efficient travel along the corridor under existing and anticipated future conditions.

According to the 2000 Census, the City of Manassas had a population of approximately 35,135 people
residing in 12,114 households. Annual estimate from the U.S. Census Bureau since 2000 show the city's
population peaked at about 37,000 people in 2004 and has since fallen back toward the 2000 level
(approximately 35,400 people as of 2007). The City encompasses an area of 9 square-miles. Prince
William Hospital is the second largest employer in the City.

The segment of Route 234 Business (Sudley Road) within the study area is a principal arterial roadway
serving the Prince William Hospital and other office and retail land uses. It serves as one of two primary
access routes between the city and Interstate 66 located several miles north of the city limits. (The other
access route between I-66 and the city is Route 28, located east of the study corridor). The Sudley Road
corridor is 1.2 miles long from Godwin Drive in the north to Grant Avenue in the south. Godwin Drive is an
arterial roadway that circumvents the western side of the city, eventually rejoining Route 234 Business
south of the city. Rolling Road, Stonewall Road and Grant Avenue are collector roads within the project
area. Figure 1 presents the map of the study area in the City of Manassas.

The objectives of this traffic study also include determining ways to enhance the bicycle and pedestrian-
friendly facilities within the study area and to create a safe urban transportation network. In addition, this
study examines options to reduce the impact of commercial vehicle (truck) traffic on congestion and
safety along the Sudley Road corridor.

                                      EXISTING CONDITIONS

Data Collection

RK&K collected peak hour turning movement counts at seven (7) signalized intersections between the
hours of 6:00 ­ 9:00 AM and 4:00 ­ 7:00 PM during a period of ten (10) days from October 21st, 2008 to
October 30th, 2008. Along with the vehicular turning movements, pedestrians and bicyclists crossing the
intersection legs were also counted. The posted speed limit varies along the length of study corridor: 45
mph from Godwin Drive to Rolling Road, 35 mph from Rolling Road to Grant Avenue, and 25 mph south
of Grant Avenue (south of the study limits). The posted speed limits along the side streets range from
25mph to 35mph.The signalized intersections in the study area are listed below.


                x   Sudley Road at Godwin Drive
                                                      x   Sudley Road at Plantation Lane
                x   Sudley Road at Rolling Road
                                                      x   Sudley Road at Stonewall Road
                x   Sudley Road at Dorsey Circle
                                                      x   Sudley Road at Grant Avenue
                x   Sudley Road at Digges Road



Route 234 Business (Sudley Road) is a four lane divided arterial with the raised median widths ranging
from 4 feet (at some intersections where there are left-turn lanes) through 40 feet (primarily at the
northern end of the corridor). The travel lane configurations at each signalized intersection along the
study corridor are presented in Figure 2.

Field Observations:

    Predominant Travel Patterns

    In addition to the turning movement count volumes, windshield surveys were conducted in the project
    area during the AM and PM peak periods on a weekday to observe the traffic patterns, pedestrian
    behavior, and bus stop usage. During both the AM and PM peak hours, through traffic (i.e., vehicles
    travelling along Sudley Road through the project area without turning left or right onto cross streets)
    was observed moving at free-flow speeds in each direction. This suggests traffic signal progression
    was good, resulting in minimal stoppages between intersections and allowing most vehicles to travel
    along each corridor at or slightly above the posted speed limit without encountering a red signal or
    residual queues. The observed directional split in traffic appeared to be relatively balanced between
    each direction of travel along Sudley Road. However, during AM peak period, traffic counts indicate
    the volumes are slightly higher in the northbound direction, and during the PM peak period, the
    volumes are slightly higher in the southbound direction. These travel patterns could be a result of the
    commuters residing in the city of Manassas who travel north to I-66 to reach their destination during
    the AM peak period and return home in the southbound direction during the PM peak period. Figure 3
    presents the AM and PM peak hour volumes along Route 234 Business (Sudley Road), and the
    turning movement count data sheets are included in Appendix A.

    Although non-turning (through) vehicles along Sudley Road were rarely delayed due to good signal
    progression, some delays along the service road (in front of post office) at the Stonewall Road
    intersection during the windshield surveys.

Traffic Analysis ­ Existing Conditions - DRAFT                                     RK&K Engineers, LLP

   During the windshield surveys, significant pedestrian and bicycle activity was observed along the
   study corridor, especially around the hospital and the post office (which is located near the Stonewall
   Road intersection). These observations were confirmed by the bicycle and pedestrian counts
   conducted at the intersections. Characteristics of the existing pedestrian facilities at each of the study
   intersections are described below:

   Sudley Road at Godwin Drive: Marked crosswalks are not provided at this intersection. An existing
   on-road bike lane is provided along eastbound Godwin Drive approaching the Sudley Road
   intersection.

   Sudley Road at Rolling Road: Marked crosswalks are not provided at this intersection.

   Sudley Road at Hospital Way/Dorsey Circle: Marked crosswalks are provided across the north
   (Sudley Road) and west (Hospital Way) legs of the intersection. Pedestrian push buttons are provided
   on the northwest, northeast and southwest corners of the intersection. There are pedestrian signal
   phases to complement the crosswalks at this intersection.

   Sudley Road at Digges Road: Marked crosswalks are not provided at this intersection.

   Sudley Road at Plantation Lane: There are marked crosswalks provided across the east leg
   (Plantation Lane) of the intersection and across. The service road parallel to Sudley Road. No
   pedestrian push buttons are provided at this intersection. There are no pedestrian signal phases at
   this intersection.

   Sudley Road at Stonewall Road: Marked crosswalks are provided across the north (Sudley Road)
   and east (Stonewall Road) legs of the intersection. Pedestrian push buttons are provided on
   northwest and northeast corners of the intersection. The crosswalk across the north leg has a
   pedestrian signal phase at this intersection.

   Sudley Road at Grant Avenue: A marked crosswalk is provided across the west leg (Grant Ave) of the
   intersection. Push buttons were provided on the southwest and northwest corners of the intersection.
   There is no pedestrian signal phase at this intersection.


   Bus Service

   OmniLink and Cross County Connector buses operated by the Potomac and Rappahannock
   Transportation Commission (PRTC) serve the study area. Bus ridership was estimated using the
   number of people observed waiting at stops, not the actual number of people riding the buses through
   the study area. During the windshield surveys, very few bus riders were observed waiting at the bus
   stops along the study corridor.

   Parking

   On-street parking is not permitted along any portion of Sudley Road or along any of the cross streets
   within several hundred feet of the traffic signals. However, the retail and office land uses appear to
   provide ample parking. During the windshield survey, it was observed that the parking lots were not
   completely occupied during AM or PM peak periods.

   Sidewalks

   Continuous sidewalks are available along both northbound and southbound Sudley Road, with the
   exception of a few breaks at the following locations: Along southbound Sudley Road from Digges
   Road to Manassas Baptist School, along northbound Sudley Road in the southeast quadrant of the

    Rolling Road intersection, and along northbound Sudley Road between Impalla Drive and Godwin
    Drive. The width of the sidewalks along the study corridor appears to be five (5) feet.

    Access Points

    Currently in the study area, there are several driveways on either side of the study corridor and also
    along side streets which serve as access points to various retail, residential and office land uses.
    Specifically, along Sudley Road from Godwin Drive to Grant Avenue, there are ten (10) driveways in
    the northbound direction and nineteen (19) driveways in the southbound direction.

    There is an existing collector-distributor (service) road along northbound side of Sudley Road from
    just north of Grant Avenue to Plantation Lane. This service road provides access to the post office,
    several banks and several other offices. Currently, long delays are being experienced by the traffic
    using this service road.

Crash History:

Crash data was provided by the City of Manassas to obtain an overview of the safety conditions along the
corridor. For a period of three years from October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2008, a total of 225
accidents were recorded along Sudley Road from Godwin Drive to Grant Avenue. Due to the limited level
of detail in the crash data, only the top five (5) causes of accidents and top six (6) intersection locations
are summarized below:

                                   Accidents Summary by Location
                                    Location                  No. of accidents

                                  Driver Inattention                 18

The crash data shows the highest number of crashes occurred at the Grant Avenue intersection, followed
by Stonewall Road and Plantation Lane intersections, with 33 and 31 accidents, respectively. The
majority of the accidents occurred because of drivers who failed to yield the Right of Way, which are
typically angle or left-turn crashes. The level of detail in the crash data provided for analysis was
insufficient for determining the severity of the reported accidents.

                                            INTERSECTION OPERATIONS

        Synchro was used to determine the delay per vehicle and levels of service at each signalized intersection
        along Sudley Road with existing traffic volumes under current roadway and land use conditions. A
        Synchro roadway network was built to replicate the study corridor using details such as lane
        configurations and turn lane lengths, signal timing and phasing information, posted speed limits, etc. Each
        of the traffic signals along Sudley Road is actuated and is part of a coordinated signal system. During AM
        and PM peak hours, the length of each coordinated cycle is 140 and 170 sec, respectively. The detailed
        signal timing plans for each of the intersections were provided by the City and are included in Appendix B.

        From the results shown in Table 1, it is evident that during the AM and PM peak hours, all signalized
        intersections along Sudley Road currently operate at acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better),
        except the intersection of Sudley Road at Grant Avenue, which operates at LOS E during the PM peak
        hour with an overall intersection delay of 78.9 seconds per vehicle.

        Potential Improvement Options:

        Synchro was used to optimize the cycle lengths, offsets, splits and phase orders for each traffic signal in
        the coordinated system along Sudley Road. The results of this exercise showed that optimizing the signal
        timing plans would achieve an acceptable level of service (LOS C) at this intersection during the PM peak
        hour.

        Additionally, each intersection has one or more approaches that currently operate at LOS E or LOS F
        during the AM and/or PM peak hour. The intersections would function at better levels of service with a few

relatively minor improvements such as optimizing signal timing and/or changing lane configurations, as
described below:

   x     Sudley Road at Godwin Drive ­ LOS E on the eastbound approach during the PM peak hour: The
         minor street (Godwin Drive) experiences long delays due to shorter green time. Optimizing the
         signal timings would help the intersection operate at better levels of service.

   x     Sudley Road at Rolling Road ­ LOS E on the eastbound approach during the AM and PM peak
         hours; LOS F on the westbound approach during the PM peak hour: The minor street (Rolling
         Road) experiences long delays due to a relatively short allocation of green time. Optimizing the
         signal timing would result in a minor delay reduction, but to achieve acceptable levels of service,
         an additional through lane would be needed along both the eastbound and westbound
         approaches.

    x    Sudley Road at Dorsey Circle ­ LOS E on the eastbound and westbound approaches during the
         PM peak hour: The eastbound and westbound approaches (Hospital Way and Dorsey Circle,
         respectively) experience long delays due to a relatively short allocation of green time to the minor
         street. Optimizing the signal timing will help the intersection operate at LOS D or better along all
         approaches.

    x    Sudley Road at Digges Road ­ LOS E on the eastbound and westbound approaches during the
         PM peak hour: The minor street (Digges Road) experiences long delays due to shorter green
         time on both eastbound and westbound approaches. Optimizing the signal timing will help the
         intersection operate at LOS D or better along all approaches.

    x    Sudley Road at Plantation Lane ­ LOS E on the eastbound and northbound approaches during
         the AM and PM peak hours: The eastbound approach (school exit) experiences long delays due
         to the existing lane configuration and limited green time. Along both approaches, optimizing the
         signal timing will improve the operations at LOS E with reduced delay.

   x     Sudley Road at Stonewall Road ­ LOS E and LOS F on the eastbound approach during the AM
         peak and PM peak hours, respectively; LOS E on the westbound approach during both the AM
         and PM peak hours: The minor street (Stonewall Road) experiences long delays due to a
         relatively short allocation of green time along both eastbound and westbound approaches. The
         stop-controlled intersection along the service road immediately east of the signalized intersection
         on Sudley Road also contributes to the excessive delay experienced at this location. Optimizing
         the signal timing will help improve operations. However, additional analysis is needed to develop
         modifications to the traffic control along the service road that would further reduce the delay
         experienced at this location.

   x     Sudley Road at Grant Ave ­ LOS E on the eastbound approach during the AM and PM peak
         hours; LOS F on the westbound approach, LOS F on the northbound approach and LOS E on the
         southbound approach during the PM peak hour: Optimizing the signal timing will help the
         intersection operate at LOS C. The southbound approach seems to experience longer delays due
         to the high right-turn volumes using the shared through/right-turn lane. Providing an exclusive
         right-turn lane would improve the capacity for this movement. Along the westbound approach, the
         delays are due to high left-turn volumes. Providing a protected left-turn phase would improve the
         operations.

Preliminary Issues

One of the major traffic concerns is the collector-distributor (service) road connecting Plantation Lane and
Stonewall Road. Due to the high volume of traffic being generated by the post office located along this
service road, the intersection of Sudley Road and Stonewall Road is experiencing long delays. The traffic
entering and exiting the post office experiences excessive delay when turning onto Sudley Road.

An additional concern is the truck traffic using Stonewall Road as a cut-through option to avoid Route 234
(Sudley Road). Since the majority of lane uses along Stonewall Road are residential, the truck traffic
through these residential areas is a general nuisance and could be a potential safety issue.


Preliminary Opportunities

To achieve a better level of operation along the service road between Plantation Lane and Stonewall
Road, it will be necessary identify alternate access points for the post office and other offices that are
currently served by the parallel roadway.

The use of Stonewall Road by trucks could be discouraged by implementing traffic calming techniques
and diverted to Godwin Drive which has a posted speed limit of 45 mph and can accommodate trucks
without any operational issues.

                                           Hospital Site Comparisons
  Compiled by Drew Shapiro (Intern, City of Manassas Community Development Department) ­ November, 2009

To get a sense as to what one might expect both from a design/streetscape and economic development perspective
with a recently acquired Novant Health hospital ­ in this case Prince William Hospital (PWH) ­ it is appropriate to
examine other Novant facilities and their surrounding areas. Included herein is information pertaining to three other
Novant hospital facilities. In comparing other facilities to PWH the following is examined:

   x   hospital patient traffic
   x   building design (specifically covered parking options)
   x   how the facility is situated in relation to surrounding land uses
   x   proximity of certain business (i.e. hotels, restaurants, and general shopping)
   x   information on zoning and land use practices contained in other jurisdictions' zoning ordinance or
       comprehensive plan

Rowan Regional Medical Center (Salisbury, NC), Forsyth Medical Center (Winston-Salem, NC), and Presbyterian
Hospital ­ Mathews (Matthews, NC) have all been selected for comparison based on the following characteristics:

   x similar service offerings
   x locations within sizable metropolitan statistical areas or within 50 of a major city
   x working off the assumption that PWH will grow in the future, the hospitals selected for comparison (with the
     exception of Matthews) have larger bed capacity

The following page shows two tables. The first table gives descriptions of each hospital facility and the second
shows basic hospital traffic statistics among all the hospitals.

Location and Proximity Maps:

This map shows a high overhead view of Rowan Regional Medical Center in Salisbury, NC. The hospital is
marked as a vertical yellow rectangle toward the top of the map. Closest to the facility are a cluster of restaurants
located a little less than a mile west on W. Innes Street. Additionally, there is a central business area located along S.
Main Street in the downtown area a little further south of the hospital, along with some hotels located just off route 85
(demarcated with a horizontal red oval), which is 2.5 miles away from the hospital and about a six minute drive:




                                                                                                                         3
A closer in view of Rowan Regional is displayed below. This shows the generous amount of surface parking
dedicated to the site (pointed out on the map), which acts as a buffer between the physical facilities and the mostly
residential areas, primarily on the western edge. Practically the entire hospital site is surrounded by residential
property, although there are some small businesses, many of which are medical practices being run out of single
family homes, that dot the perimeter of the site:




                                                                                                                        4
The map below shows an overhead visual representation of Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem, NC. Note
the major roadways bordering the hospital to the south/west (Silas Creek Parkway) and north (S. Hawthorne Road).
There are several businesses located along these roadways, such as a Days Inn and Chick-Fil-A along Silas Creek
Parkway and various independent medical facilities located along S. Hawthorne, just north of the hospital.
Immediately adjacent to the hospital is a shopping center (outlined in red) and further to the west along S. Stratford
Road are several eating establishments. It is also easy to see the generous amount of surface parking being utilized at
this site, most notably on the east side where it abuts a residential area:




                                                                                                                      5
This next map shows a wide overhead view of Presbyterian Hospital ­ Matthews in Matthews, NC. Given that it
has a relatively small population (22,127 according to 2000 census figures) to the other jurisdictions being examined,
Matthews has much less development surrounding its hospital. Below, one can see that there is a cluster of
restaurants and other businesses in a downtown area of Matthews just west of the hospital facility. Looking east
along the Andrew Jackson Highway there is a grouping of hotels:




                                                                                                                     6
A closer overhead view of Presbyterian Hospital is displayed below. Note the lack significant development close-in
around the hospital's perimeter, the significant forest buffer along the southern edges of the property, as well as the
surface lot coverage that also has some landscaping:




                                                                                                                          7
Streetscape/Site Design:

Moving on to issues of design principles implemented by these Novant Health facilities, below one can observe two
ground level photos of Rowan Regional Medical Center facility in Salisbury, NC. The first photo (left) shows an
adequate sidewalk with landscaping and lighting. Although the photo is limited in showing this, building height does
increase toward the center of the complex. Underground parking is observable under the primary building shown in
both of the photos below:




                                                                                                                   8
As seen below, Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem, NC also has covered parking available to compliment
their surface parking:




                                                                                                              9
Below are two photos of separate entrances for Presbyterian Hospital-Matthews in Matthews, NC along Matthews
Township Parkway (northern border). Notice the significant tree coverage used as a buffer to the facility:




                                                                                                          10
Below is an on-campus shot of the Presbyterian Hospital facility in Matthews:




                                                                                11
Comprehensive Planning and Zoning:

Salisbury, NC (Rowan Regional Medical Center):

The Salisbury, NC comprehensive plan does not cite anything specific about Rowan Regional Medical Center. The
comprehensive plan however, does have "Primary" and "Secondary Growth Areas." Given that the medical center is
located close to the center of the city it is considered to be in the "Primary Growth Area," which will be far more
tolerant of growth and development.

Salisbury's zoning ordinance explains that the medical center is located within one of several "assigned districts."
These districts are "...intended to accommodate specialized uses and districts that do not fit into the prescribed
Transect categories, such as airports, college campuses, and regional hospitals. In the City of Salisbury case, this
also includes the accommodation of a broad range of high-intensity, automotive-oriented retail and service uses that
require high visibility and highly- accessible locations along arterial streets and do not cater directly to pedestrians
while requiring sufficient off-street parking."

More specifically, Rowan Regional is located within the city's Hospital Services District (HS); described as:

"...a primary employment center generally concentrated within ¼ mile of a local hospital complex. It permits the
continuation and expansion of the hospital complex, as well as supporting uses such as office, lodging, and limited
retail uses in close proximity."

The Salisbury zoning ordinance later notes that the HS district does not contain a maximum density.

                                                                                                                       12
Winstson-Salem, NC (Forsyth Medical Center):

Information about Forsyth Medical Center is observable in Winston-Salem's Southwest Area Plan. It notes the
following:

   x "Forsyth Hospital completed three rezoning petitions to define its campus boundaries
   x A proposed regional passenger rail line connecting Forsyth and Guilford Counties is currently being
     developed by the Piedmont Authority for Regional Transportation (PART). Forsyth Medical is mentioned as a
     potential stop along a proposed route."

In terms of planning for the future growth, the plan notes the following:

"Forsyth Medical Center offers a full continuum of emergency, medical, surgical, rehabilitative and behavioral
health services. The campus, including Medical Park Hospital, occupies the largest amount of land in the Planning
Area. Hospital expansion into residential areas has not been controversial at this location because there is only a
small portion of a residential neighborhood adjacent to the campus district. More concerning is the possible
expansion of medical offices north of Hawthorne Road and west of Bolton Street. General recommendations include:

   x Maintain the future growth of the hospital within the existing Campus District Boundary.
   x Continue to build vertically rather than horizontally within the Campus District Boundary.
   x Design future developments to continue to have the more intense/higher buildings closer to Silas Creek
     Parkway. Scale down any new construction from more intensive development to less intense/lower buildings as
     development approaches the eastern edge of the campus.
   x Discourage surface parking lots except as a temporary use. Parking structures with street level retail and
     services are preferable where possible.
   x Keep future Medical Center development within the boundaries of the existing Campus Zoning District. Do not
     rezone additional properties east of the existing Residential Multifamily (RMU-S) zoning district (on the east
     boundary of the hospital property).
   x Do not provide a connection from the Campus Zoning District east to Bolton Street or Hermitage Drive.

                                                                                                                  13
   x The area north of the hospital has a mixture of large and small commercial and office uses and a number of
     significant structures built in the Modernist Style. The street pattern with short, local roads and narrow block
     widths is not conducive to large-footprint buildings with large amounts of parking. The Plan recommends
     maintaining the mixture of small commercial and office developments supporting local small businesses.
     Redevelopment of properties should continue to be for small-scale commercial and office buildings."

Matthews, NC (Presbyterian Hospital ­ Matthews):

The town of Matthews, NC's Land Use Plan (2002-2012) touches lightly upon the presence of Presbyterian Hospital.
In a section titled "Existing Conditions" it states:

"The majority of existing office development has generally been located in or adjacent to Downtown Matthews and to
the east of Downtown along Matthews-Mint Hill Road. A new concentration is beginning to become apparent along
Matthews Township Parkway, as an anticipated result of the opening of Presbyterian Hospital Matthews."

The section goes on to note:

"Medical clinics are increasing near the hospital. Offices can be developed in business zoning categories, so much
of the area around the hospital is potentially available for office development. Office uses provide support services
to both the commercial and residential sectors of the community, and they can serve as transition areas or buffers
between residential areas and more intensive land uses. It is important that these uses be controlled to ensure that
they do not simply become extensions of nearby commercial strip development areas."




                                                                                                                        14
In a separate section titled "Transition Strips or Areas" Presbyterian Hospital is referenced in the following manner:

"NC51/MATTHEWS TOWNSHIP PARKWAY: SAM NEWELL ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE

This was the first portion of the new alignment of NC51, built in the mid-1980's. It was designed and constructed as
a part of the very first Conditional zoning approved in Matthews, and the project at that time included property
where Matthews Festival shopping center, Paces Commons Apartments, Matthews Village Apartments, Matthews
Township Office Park, and Presbyterian Hospital Matthews now stand. Across NC51 from Matthews Festival is
mixed use development called Independence Pointe, including Target and Chef's Market. At the opposite end of this
section is property zoned as a commercial business park including a medical office building, a bank, a pharmacy, and
an industrial office facility. The entire length of this section of NC51 has zoning with conditions attached. New
development also falls under the Highway Overlay District requirements. The hospital was designed to meet and
exceed Highway Overlay landscaping requirements, and is an outstanding example of the intent of the Highway
Overlay as it relates to preserving existing trees. This same care to meeting the intent of the Overlay District may
not be present on other sites, where variances to the undisturbed front buffer have been granted."

And:

"MATTHEWS-MINT HILL ROAD: DOWNTOWN TO INDEPENDENCE

This road was designated NC51 for many years, and developed as a commercial street due to the traffic it carried.
Now that it is no longer a designated route, it is a local connector, and still serves a valuable purpose. Where the
Downtown Master Plan covers uses, design guidelines, and streetscaping, these policies should be followed. The
area by the hospital rear entrance is designated as a downtown gateway, and a sign posted there assists in creating
the downtown atmosphere. From the hospital property back toward Independence, several properties are
undeveloped or underdeveloped and should be considered for office uses.

· Where new uses or redevelopment is proposed, it should focus on professional or service offices."

Conclusion:

All three jurisdictions examined in this report seem to be willing to accommodate expansions of hospital facilities as
well as more development around the sites as evidenced by information contained in their respective comprehensive
plans and zoning ordinances. Salisbury and Winston-Salem cite a commitment to vertical development of their
hospital sites and Winston-Salem goes so far as to envision a light-rail route that will service Forsyth Medical Center
among other critical facilities.

The facilities are all surrounded by varying degrees of residential, light office commercial, and retail commercial land
uses. Many of the commercial businesses are those that compliment the hospitals, such as private medical practices
run out of single family homes or small office buildings and other complimentary medical offices. All of the
hospitals have restaurants and hotels within relatively short driving and/or walking distances from them.

Design-wise, the facilities all seem to have fairly compact overall structures that concentrate development in a
vertical fashion. The most spread out facility appears to be Rowan Regional Medical Center in Salisbury, NC. All of
the sites have an imbalance of parking options that favor surface parking over covered garages. Rowan Regional and
Forsyth Medical Center (Winston-Salem) have larger shares of covered parking options at their facilities. Despite the
generous supply of surface parking at the Presbyterian Hospital site in Matthews, NC, the facility's parking area is
sufficiently landscaped and the entire perimeter is well flanked by thick forest that buffers it from the surrounding
main roads.

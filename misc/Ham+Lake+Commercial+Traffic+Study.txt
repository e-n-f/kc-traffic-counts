   1. Introduction and Summary
           a. Purpose of Report and Study Objectives
               G&A Home Mortgage is proposing a commercial development on the
               southwest quadrant of Highway 65 and 143rd Avenue in Ham Lake,
               MN. The purpose of this report is to determine if completion of this
               development will significantly impact the adjacent transportation
               system.

               The study objectives are:
                   i. Determine how the existing Highway 65 intersection at 143rd
                      Avenue currently operates.
                  ii. Determine if the following intersections will operate with
                      acceptable vehicle delays and stacking after the development
                      is completed in 2010.
                          · Existing Highway 65 intersection at 143rd Avenue.
                          · Proposed southbound right-in/right-out intersection on
                            Highway 65 south of 143rd Avenue.
                          · Proposed tee intersection west of Highway 65 on 143rd
                            Avenue (143rd Avenue/Backage Road intersection).
                 iii. Recommend improvements if needed.

           b. Executive Summary
               G&A Home Mortgage is proposing a new commercial development to
               be located on the southwest corner of the intersection of Highway 65
               and 143rd Avenue in Ham Lake, MN. The site is currently occupied
               by vacant buildings that have three right-in/right-out driveways on
               Highway 65. This redevelopment is proposed to contain a gas
               station with convenience store & car wash, a restaurant, a hotel, an
               automated car wash, a quick lube shop, a vehicle detailing shop, and
               a bookstore. Access to the development will be from a new
               southbound right-in/right-out intersection on Highway 65 south of
               143rd Avenue (the three existing driveways on Highway 65 will be
               closed) and from adding a southbound third leg on 143rd Avenue
               creating a tee intersection west of Highway 65.

               Mn/DOT has requested a traffic study be completed to determine the
               traffic impacts of the new development on the adjacent roadways for
               2010 (when it is assumed full occupancy will occur). The
               intersections studied are:
                          · Existing Highway 65 intersection at 143rd Avenue.
                          · Proposed southbound right-in/right-out intersection on
                              Highway 65 south of 143rd Avenue.

                         ·   Proposed tee intersection west of Highway 65 on 143rd
                             Avenue (southbound backage road).

               The principal findings of this study are:
                   i. The proposed Highway 65 southbound right-in/right-out
                      intersection on Highway 65 south of 143rd Avenue will operate
                      acceptably at LOS A. Access management is being enhanced
                      by replacing the site's existing three right-in/right-out
                      intersections with the one proposed right-in/right-out
                      intersection.
                  ii. The proposed 143rd Avenue tee intersection will operate
                      acceptably at LOS A.
                 iii. The Highway 65 intersection at 143rd Avenue currently
                      operates unacceptably at Level of Service (LOS) F in the
                      weekday p.m. peak hour and will continue to operate at LOS F
                      through the 2010 Build scenario when the site is completely
                      redeveloped. The intersection will operate acceptably at LOS
                      C or better through the 2010 Build scenario if the intersection
                      is controlled with a traffic signal and left turn lanes are
                      constructed on 143rd Avenue.
                 iv. An Intersection Control Evaluation report will need to be
                      completed for the Highway 65/143rd Avenue intersection per
                      Mn/DOT policy, but the likely outcome is that the intersection
                      will need to be controlled with a traffic signal. The intersection
                      meets Warrants 1, 2, and 3 for traffic signal control per the
                      Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices in the
                      2010 Build scenario and it meets the criteria for allowing traffic
                      signal control per Mn/DOT's Access Management Manual.

               To adequately mitigate the traffic impacts of the proposed
               development, the following improvement plan is recommended:
                   i. Install a traffic signal at the Highway 65/143rd Avenue
                      intersection. This will require an Intersection Control
                      Evaluation report for Mn/DOT approval.
                  ii. Construct left turn lanes on each 143rd Avenue approach to
                      Highway 65 in conjunction with the traffic signal installation per
                      Mn/DOT policy.
                 iii. Construct the proposed 143rd Avenue/Backage Road
                      intersection with stop sign control on the backage road, no
                      stop signs on 143rd Avenue, and a single lane approach on all
                      three legs of the intersection (no turn lanes are needed).
                 iv. Construct a southbound to westbound right turn lane on
                      Highway 65 at the proposed right-in/right-out intersection
                      south of 143rd Avenue. The right-out approach should be
                      stop sign controlled and Highway 65 should remain free
                      flowing.

   3. Analysis of Existing Conditions
           a. Physical Characteristics
               Access to the site will be provided from two proposed entrances.
                  · Proposed southbound right-in/right-out intersection on
                     Highway 65 south of 143rd Avenue. This access will replace
                     the existing three right-in/right-out accesses the site currently
                     has on Highway 65.
                  · Proposed tee intersection west of Highway 65 on 143rd
                     Avenue at the proposed southbound backage road.

               Highway 65 (Central Avenue) is designated as a high priority regional
               corridor (Mn/DOT category 3B) near the site. Existing traffic control,
               speed limits, and travel lanes are shown on Figure 3.1. No roadway
               improvements are scheduled near the site. The Highway 65/143rd
               Avenue intersection is half a mile south of the signalized Highway
               65/Andover Boulevard intersection and three quarters of a mile north
               of the signalized Highway 65/Bunker Lake Boulevard intersection.

               There is no transit service near the proposed redevelopment that will
               impact the traffic patterns of the development.

           b. Traffic Volumes
               The a.m. and p.m. peak hour turning movement counts were
               conducted in 2008 at the existing study intersection (see Figures 3.2
               & 3.3). The turning movement count data is contained in fifteen
               minute intervals in the Appendix. The daily traffic volumes for the
               area roadways are shown on Figure 3.4. The daily traffic volumes
               collected in 2008 are contained by hour, per approach in the
               Appendix.

           c. Level of Service
                       LOS A             An intersection capacity analysis was conducted
                                         for the existing intersections per the Highway
                                         Capacity Manual. Intersections are assigned a
                                         "Level of Service" letter grade for the peak hour
                                         of traffic based on the number of lanes at the
                                         intersection, traffic volumes, and traffic control.
                       LOS C             Level of Service A (LOS A) represents light
                                         traffic flow (free flow conditions) while Level of
                                         Service F (LOS F) represents heavy traffic flow
                                         (over capacity conditions). LOS D is considered
                                         acceptable in urban conditions. Each approach
                 LOS D = Acceptable      to the intersection is also assigned a LOS grade.
                                         At side street, stop sign controlled intersections,
                                         LOS F is sometimes considered acceptable if
                                         the delays are not onerous. The pictures on the
                                         left represent some of the LOS grades (from a
                                         signal controlled intersection in San Jose, CA).
                LOS F = Unacceptable

                                   The LOS results for the 2008 study hours are
                                   shown in Table 3.1. These are based on the
                                   existing traffic control and lane configurations as
                Source: City of    shown in Figure 3.1. The existing turning

                                   movement volumes from Figure 3.2 and 3.3
               were used in the LOS calculations. The LOS calculations were done
               using SYNCHROTM software. The complete LOS calculations are
               included in the Appendix.

                 Intersection can be mitigated acceptably to LOS B if a traffic signal is installed.

               The Highway 65/143rd Avenue intersection currently operates at
               LOS A in the morning peak period, but according to the LOS
               calculations traffic from 143rd Avenue waits approximately three and
               a half minutes to turn onto Highway 65. The delays in the evening
               rush hour are so high that it is not possible to calculate the delay per
               the Highway Capacity Manual algorithms.

   4. Projected Traffic
           a. Site Traffic Forecasting
               A trip generation analysis was performed for the site based on the
               methods and rates published in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th
               Edition. The weekday a.m. peak hour trip generation is for the "one
               hour of adjacent street traffic" from 7-9 a.m. The weekday p.m. peak
               hour trip generation is for the "one hour of adjacent street traffic" from
               4-6 p.m. The resultant trip generations are shown in Table 4.1.

               Some of the customers who will visit the retail development are
               currently using Highway 65. Based on data contained in ITE's Trip
               Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition, a percentage of the trips
               generated by each store are assumed to be diverted from the current
               traffic volumes on Highway 65 into the development. These are
               labeled pass-by trips in Table 4.1.

               The directional orientation of the generated traffic is shown in Figure
               4.1. This orientation is based on a weighted distribution of the traffic
               volumes currently using Highway 65 and 143rd Avenue.

               The a.m. peak hour, p.m. peak hour and daily trips generated by the
               site were assigned to the area roadways per the trip distributions
               shown in Figure 4.1. Figures 4.2 through 4.4 show the traffic added
               by the development in the a.m. peak hour, p.m. peak hour and daily
               conditions respectively.

           b. Non-site Traffic Forecasting
               Traffic forecasts were developed for the year 2010 No-Build scenario
               by applying a 2.38% compounded annual growth rate to the existing
               traffic volume data. This growth rate is based on the 20 year growth
               factor of 1.6 the Mn/DOT State Aid office has assigned to Anoka
               County. The 2010 No-Build forecasts are shown in Figures 4.5
               through 4.7.

           c. Total Traffic for 2010
               Traffic forecasts were developed for the year 2010 Build scenario by
               adding the traffic generated by the proposed development, as shown
               in Figures 4.2 through 4.4, to the No-Build volumes shown in Figures
               4.5 through 4.7. The resultant 2010 Build traffic forecasts are shown
               in Figures 4.8 through 4.10.

   5. Traffic and Improvement Analysis
           a. Site Access
               Proposed access to the site will be through a new southbound right-
               in/right-out intersection on Highway 65 south of 143rd Avenue and a
               new third leg (backage road) creating a tee intersection on 143rd
               Avenue west of Highway 65.

           b. 2010 Level of Service Analysis
               The LOS results for the 2010 study hours are shown in Tables 5.1 &
               5.2. These are based on the existing traffic control and lane
               configurations as shown in Figure 3.1. The forecast turning
               movement volumes from Figures 4.5, 4.6, 4.8 and 4.9 were used in
               the LOS calculations. It is assumed the proposed 143rd Avenue
               /Backage Road intersection will have a single lane of approach on all
               three legs, the backage road will be stop sign controlled, and 143rd
               Avenue will remain free flowing. It is assumed a right turn lane will
               be provided on Highway 65 for the proposed right-in/right-out
               intersection and the right-out approach will have a single, stop sign
               controlled lane. The LOS calculations were done using SYNCHROTM
               software. The complete LOS calculations are included in the
               Appendix.

                 Intersection can be mitigated acceptably to LOS C if a traffic signal is installed

Traffic Impact Study                                                                  September, 2008

               The Highway 65/143rd Avenue intersection will continue to operate
               unacceptably at LOS F in the 2010 No-Build and Build scenarios.
               The intersection will operate acceptably at LOS C if a traffic signal is
               installed (per Mn/DOT's policies, it is assumed westbound to
               southbound and eastbound to northbound left turn lanes would be
               added on 143rd Avenue with the traffic signal). The two proposed
               intersections will operate acceptably at LOS A in the 2010 Build
               scenarios.

               Figures 4.7 and 4.10 show the 2010 daily volumes anticipated on
               Highway 65 and 143rd Avenue in the No-Build and Build scenarios.
               Based on calculations from the Transportation Research Board's
               Highway Capacity Manual, a four lane divided roadway such as
               Highway 65 will operate at LOS D if the road carries approximately
               28,000 to 35,000 vehicles per day. Highway 65 currently operates
               unacceptably at LOS E (carrying 36,000 vehicles per day) and will
               continue to operate at LOS E in 2010 (carrying just short of 40,000
               vehicles per day). Based on calculations from the Transportation
               Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual, a two lane undivided
               road such as 143rd Avenue will operate at LOS D if the road carries
               approximately 6,500 to 8,500 vehicles per day. 143rd Avenue will
               operate acceptably through the 2010 Build scenario when it is
               forecast to carry 4,400 vehicles per day.

           c. Traffic Control Needs
               A traffic signal warrant analysis was done for the 2010 Build scenario
               per the Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The
               existing and 2010 No-Build traffic volumes are too low to warrant
               traffic signal control for the intersection.

               The following methodology was used to develop the hourly approach
               volumes for the 2010 Build traffic signal warrant analysis for the
               Highway 65/143rd Avenue intersection contained in the Appendix:
                1. Average the 48 hour approach volumes in the Appendix to 24
                    hour approach volumes.
                2. Factor out the right turn movement volumes from the 143rd
                    Avenue approaches (per Mn/DOT policy) based on the morning
                    and evening peak hour turning movement volumes distributions
                    (the a.m. percentage was applied to the midnight to noon hours
                    and the p.m. percentage was applied to the noon to midnight
                    hours).
                3. Factor the approach volumes with the 2.38% compounded
                    annual growth rate to convert the 2008 volumes to 2010 No-
                    Build volumes.
                4. Determine the distribution of each hour compared to the 24 hour
                    volume.

                 5. Apply these hourly distribution patterns to the a.m. and p.m.
                    peak hour approach volumes to develop 24 hour approach
                    volumes. (Note: All left and through volumes from Figures 4.8
                    and 4.9 were included. Right turn volumes were not included on
                    143rd Avenue but were included on Highway 65 per Mn/DOT
                    policy.)
                 6. The hourly volumes from midnight to noon are based on the
                    a.m. peak hour forecasts in Figure 4.8 and the hourly volumes
                    from noon to midnight are based on the p.m. peak hour
                    forecasts in Figure 4.9.
                 7. The resultant hourly approach forecasts are shown in the
                    warrant analysis in the Appendix.

               The forecasts from the above procedure were used to perform the
               signal warrant analysis included in the Appendix. In the analysis
               each approach was assumed to have at least two lanes, the right turn
               movements were removed from the minor street volumes, and the
               lower criteria were used based on the 65 mph speed limit on
               Highway 65. This analysis shows the intersection will meet Warrant
               1 (Eight Hour Warrant), Warrant 2 (Four Hour Warrant), and Warrant
               3 (Peak Hour Warrant) in the 2010 Build scenario.

               A separate Intersection Control Evaluation report will need to be
               completed per Mn/DOT's Technical Memorandum No. 07-02-T-01 to
               analyze the alternatives of controlling the intersection with an all-way
               stop, roundabout, or traffic signal. The Highway 65/143rd Avenue
               intersection is midway between two intersections that are controlled
               by traffic signals (1/2 mile south of Andover Boulevard and ¾ mile
               north of Bunker Lake Boulevard). The alternative of controlling the
               intersection with a traffic signal coordinated with the signals north and
               south is likely the best alternative. Per Mn/DOT's Access
               Management Manual a traffic signal would be allowed at the
               intersection (under Category 3B) until the corridor is converted to
               limited access with interchanges. At that time the backage road
               system to Bunker Lake Boulevard would likely be completed and
               provide access to Highway 65.

               It is Mn/DOT's policy to require exclusive left turn lanes on all
               approaches if a traffic signal is installed to control an intersection.
               Left turn lanes would need to be constructed on 143rd Avenue in
               conjunction with installation of the traffic signal.

   6. Conclusions
   The Highway 65 intersection at 143rd Avenue in Ham Lake currently operates
   at LOS F during the weekday p.m. peak hour and will continue to operate at
   LOS F in the 2010 No-Build and Build scenarios. To mitigate this poor
   operation a traffic signal and left turn lanes should be built at the intersection by
   the time the proposed development is built out. It is forecast traffic signal
   control will be warranted at the intersection per the Minnesota Manual on
   Uniform Traffic Control Devices, but a full Intersection Control Evaluation report
   will be needed per Mn/DOT's policy.

   Traffic signal control at the intersection is allowable per the guidelines in
   Mn/DOT's Access Management Manual. The Highway 65/143rd Avenue
   intersection is approximately half a mile away from the nearest signalized
   intersections on Highway 65 and signals are allowed on Highway 65 as an
   interim step until such time as the corridor is converted to limited access with
   interchanges. At that time, it is anticipated 143rd Avenue would be closed and
   the backage road would be connected to Bunker Lake Boulevard. These
   improvements are not currently programmed by Mn/DOT.

   The proposed 143rd Avenue/Backage Road intersection will operate acceptably
   at LOS A in the 2010 Build peak hours with stop sign control on the backage
   road, no stop signs on 143rd Avenue, and a single lane approach on all three
   legs of the intersection (no turn lanes are needed).

   The proposed right-in/right out on Highway 65 south of 143rd Avenue will
   operate acceptably at LOS A in the 2010 Build peak hours with stop sign
   control on the right-out approach, an exclusive southbound to westbound right
   turn lane provided on Highway 65, and no stop signs on Highway 65.
   Consolidating the site's three existing driveway intersections on Highway 65
   into one driveway intersection provides improved access management for the
   site.

   7. Recommendations
   Based on the traffic analysis contained in this report, the following
   improvements are recommended:
      · Install a traffic signal at the Highway 65/143rd Avenue intersection. This
         will require an Intersection Control Evaluation report for Mn/DOT
         approval.
      · Construct left turn lanes on each 143rd Avenue approach to Highway 65
         in conjunction with the traffic signal per Mn/DOT policy.
      · Construct the proposed 143rd Avenue /Backage Road intersection with
         stop sign control on the backage road, no stop signs on 143rd Avenue,
         and a single lane approach on all three legs of the intersection (no turn
         lanes are needed).
      · Construct a right turn lane on Highway 65 at the proposed right-in/right-
         out intersection south of 143rd Avenue. The right-out approach should
         be stop sign controlled and Highway 65 should remain free flowing.

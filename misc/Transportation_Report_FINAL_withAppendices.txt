Context

The City of Flowery Branch, with support from the Gainesville-Hall Metropolitan Planning
Organization (GHMPO), has funded this study of the transportation needs within the City's historic
downtown core. The City, founded in 1874, has seen significant population growth in the recent
decade. According to the 2000 Census, the population of Flowery Branch was 1,806. However,
more recent population estimates place the City's population at 3,966. The growth that the City
has experienced has increased the amount of traffic that moves around and through downtown,
which in turn has resulted in a greater strain on the City's aging infrastructure.


Study Area

The study area is bounded by McEver Road to the north, Lights Ferry Road to the west, Atlanta
Highway and Mulberry Street to the south, and Gainesville Street to the east. A map of the study
area is shown in Figure 1.


Need and Purpose

The purpose of this study is to identify a series of transportation improvements to address the
vehicular and pedestrian needs of the City's historic downtown area. It is important that these
improvements be developed based on a combination of engineering evaluation, community input,
and City staff insight. Furthermore, the recommendations of this study must be achievable with
respect to the reality of both funding and construction constraints that affect the implementation
of any infrastructure project.

2.1 LAND USE
The Study Area is approximately 543 acres in size. Residential land use makes up more than
one-third of the study area, and agricultural use is more than one-fourth of the study area. The
current composition of land uses is as follows:
 Agricultural            27.74%
 Commercial              4.89%
 Conservation Use        10.62%
 Exempt                  3.58%
 Industrial              1.64%
 Public Utility Area     0.08%
 Residential             37.26%
 Public Right of Way     14.29%

Figure 2 shows the location of these land uses.


2.1.1 Development and Redevelopment Opportunities
The Flowery Branch Comprehensive Plan identifies a portion of Old Town, the historic core of
Flowery Branch, as the redevelopment focus area within downtown. A redevelopment boundary
is established within the Plan, which identifies the two most important blocks of land that are in
need of redevelopment. These blocks are:
· Block No. 1: That part of the block (excluding existing buildings fronting on Main Street)
    bounded by Main Street, Church Street, Chestnut Street and Railroad Avenue; and
· Block No. 2: That block bounded by Gainesville, Pine, Mitchell and Main Streets.

In general, the vision for redevelopment in these areas consists primarily of mixed-use development
and an increase in development intensity. A proposal for redeveloping a portion of Block No. 1 has
already been discussed with the City. From a traffic generation standpoint this redevelopment is
estimated to add 1,964 new daily trips, 77 morning weekday peak hour trips, and 185 afternoon
weekday peak hour trips to the roadway network if/when completed.

As previously stated, more than one-fourth of the study area (approximately 150 acres) is currently
agricultural land and poses the possibility for new development. A proposal for developing 106
acres of this land as single-family residential has been brought before the City in the past. The
development, as it was proposed, was estimated to add 2,603 new daily trips, 199 morning
weekday peak hour trips, and 264 afternoon weekday peak hour trips to the roadway network.
Though the recent economic environment has generally slowed or halted this type of development,
it is likely that this property will be developed at some point in the future.

2.2 TRANSPORTATION INVENTORY
2.2.1 Functional Classifications
Roadway systems are made up of roads that serve different roles. Functional classification is
used to define the role or "function" that a given road plays in the overall roadway network.
Functional classification groups streets and highways based on the character of the service they
are intended to provide. In general terms, the higher the level of access that a roadway provides
there is a corresponding lower level of mobility. A good roadway network will have a balance of
high access and high mobility roads. There are three primary categories of roads. They are, in
order of decreasing mobility: arterials, collectors, and local streets.

Arterials
These are roads that connect cities, towns, and other traffic generators. Arterials typically attract
longer trips. At the highest level they can include freeways and have higher levels of mobility,
though many minor arterials are only two lanes in width.

Collectors
These medium volume roads collect and distribute traffic between arterials and local streets. They
have a lower level of mobility than arterials.

Local Streets
These roads facilitate short-range trips, provide the highest level of access, and usually have the
lowest level of mobility. Both travel speeds and volumes are lower on local streets. Though often
associated with residential land uses, local streets are not limited to residential areas.

Within the study are there are approximately 10 miles of roadway. These roads, grouped by
Georgia DOT functional classification, are shown in Table 1 below. They are also shown in Figure
3.


 Road Type                       Length (mi.)      Percentage

 Urban Minor Arterial Street     3.24              31.64%

 Urban Collector Street          0.12              1.16%

 Urban Local Road                6.81              66.59%

 Rural Local Road                0.06              0.61%

 Total:                         10.23              100.00%
Table 1. Roadway Classification

As shown in Table 1 above, more than two-thirds of the roads within the study area are local roads.

The ownership of roads can be either State, local (City or County), or private. Table 2 shows
the breakdown of roadway ownership/responsibility in the study area. This information is also
depicted in Figure 4.


 Ownership/Responsibility    Length (mi.)     Percentage

 Local                       9.41             92.01%

 Private                     0.07             0.67%

 State                       0.75             7.32%

 Total:                      10.23            100.00%

2.2.2 Existing Transportation Infrastructure Conditions
An existing conditions inventory was performed of the streets within the study area. Information
captured in this inventory includes:

 Speed Limit (if posted)
 Number of Lanes
 Pavement Type
 Right-of-Way Width (if available)
 Roadway Width
 Visual Assessment of Pavement and Striping Condition
 Observed Safety Issues
 Public Right-of-Way
 One-way or Two-way Traffic Flow

The detailed Inventory is provided in the Appendix to this report. In general, the condition of
the majority of the transportation infrastructure within the study area is poor. Some of the more
common issues are summarized below.

Signing and Marking

Much of the pavement marking is faded or does not exist at all. Many of the regulatory signs and
warning signs are too low and do not meet the height requirements of the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). There is also a lack of street name signs and parking signs.
Figures 5 and 6 show examples of regulatory signs mounted too low to meet MUTCD requirements.
An excerpt from the MUTCD, which shows proper sign locations and heights, is provided in the
Appendix.

Roadway Conditions
In some locations the pavement is worn and cracked (see Figure 7). A more in-depth evaluation of
pavement condition was recently performed by Hall County Government. This report inventoried
all roadways and included a rating sheet that assigned a numerical value on pavement condition,
road use, homes or areas served by the road, and the road classification. It is the City's intention
to use this inventory in concert with the findings of this study to determine the order and need of
transportation improvements within the study area.

and Spring Street, facing Northeast

Safety Issues
Several of the roads within the study area have very narrow travel lanes, which can have a great
influence on the safety and comfort of driving. There were five two-way roads, or segments of
roads, identified that have a total width of 12 ft (6 ft per lane), and one two-way road with a
total width of 18 ft (9 ft per lane). Recommended typical lane widths range from 9 to 12 ft.
The appropriate width depends on factors such as traffic volume, speed of traffic, and adjacent

                                                                                                       11

     land use. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
     Geometric Design of Highways and Streets states that 11 ft lanes in urban conditions, 10 ft lanes
     on low-speed facilities, and 9 ft lanes on low-volume facilities in rural and residential areas are
     acceptable.

     Other safety concerns include deep ditches (slopes greater than recommended by good design
     principles) and fixed objects such as trees, that are located too close to the roadway. AASHTO
     recommends for low-speed rural collectors and local roads a minimum clear zone of 10 ft. For
     urban conditions, where curbs are used and space is more restrictive, a minimum 18" clear zone
     should be provided. Examples of some of these conditions are shown in Figures 8, 9, and 10.

2.2.3 Data Collection
To evaluate traffic operations within the study area, turning movement counts were performed
at key intersections during the weekday morning and afternoon peak times. Traffic counts were
performed in mid-November 2009 for a two-hour period in the morning (7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.)
and a two-hour period in the afternoon (4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) at these intersections. From
this data the morning and afternoon peak hour volumes for each intersection were determined.
These peak hour volumes are shown in Figures 11 and 12. To supplement this data, traffic counts
were obtained from past traffic studies performed within the study area for various development
projects. These volumes are also shown in Figures 11 and 12. Because these counts were performed
in 2005 (McEver Road/Lights Ferry Road), 2006 (Gainesville Street/Cherokee Street), or 2008
(Snelling Avenue/Atlanta Highway), it was necessary that they be adjusted in order to represent
2009 volumes. For the 2005 and 2006 volumes, an annual growth factor of 3% per year was
applied to be representative of 2009 volumes. However, the 2008 volumes were equal to or
greater than 2009 volumes counted at adjacent intersections. Therefore, no adjustment factor
was applied to the 2008 counts.

In addition to turning movement counts, a speed study was performed on Lights Ferry Road
between Morrow Drive and Gainesville Street. This location was selected based on input from the
Community Workshop performed for this project. Table 3 below summarizes the data collected.
A detailed printout of all information collected is provided in the Appendix.

The 85th percentile speed is the speed at or below which 85% of the vehicles are traveling. So, in
this case, 85% of the vehicles are going 52 mph or less. The 85th percentile speed is often used
to set speed limits. This information tells us that vehicles are typically traveling at or faster than
the posted speed limit.

      Downtown Transportation Study

     EXISTING CONDITIONS
     2.2.4 Alternative Modes of Transportation
     Modes of transportation other than private automobile are referred to as "Alternative Modes".
     These include walking, bicycling, and public transit.

     Sidewalks

     Only a few sidewalks exist within the study area. Where sidewalks do exist, they are typically only
     along a segment of road and therefore do not provide a high level of pedestrian connectivity. The
     best example of sidewalks in the study area is within the new streetscape section along Main Street.
     These sidewalks are ADA compliant and of sufficient width to meet the needs of the commercial
     district. The City's Comprehensive Plan identifies 51,185 LF of sidewalk improvements within
     the City of Flowery Branch, most of which is located within the study area.

     There are no bike lanes, multi-use paths, or greenways within the study area. The Comprehensive
     Plan does recommend adding striped bike lanes to existing roads, where possible, or improving
     roadway shoulders for the purpose of adding bike lanes. However, there are very few roads within
     the study area that are wide enough for bike lanes to be added. The Comprehensive Plan identifies
     86,014 LF of bikeways and 44,310 LF of bikeway loop. Two greenways/multi-use trails are
     identified in the Comprehensive Plan. The first, located within the study area, would extend from
     City Park to Alberta Banks Park, a distance of approximately 1.25 miles. The second, located
     just outside of the study area, would extend approximately .43 miles from East Main Street to
     Flowery Way.

     Transit

     Hall Area Transit (HAT) is the transit provider in Hall County, but currently there are no transit
     routes to the study area.


     2.3 PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED PROJECTS
     The City has identified a number of transportation projects within the study area. These projects
     are in various stages ranging from conceptual all the way to funding identified. Table 4 on the
     following page provides a list of those projects that fall within the study area.

                                               NEEDS ASSESSMENT                                         3
3.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of the Needs Assessment is to identify both existing and future transportation
needs within the study area. The scope of this study is much more limited than a comprehensive
transportation plan. For that reason, the focus of recommendations will be on existing deficiencies
and mid-term needs (10 years), though some major long-term improvements will be recommended.
The development of the Needs Assessment for the study area is based on a combination of observed
deficiencies, information obtained from City Staff and the public (through the public workshop),
and through an operational analysis of existing and projected future traffic volumes. Travel
demand modeling for long-term recommendations has not been employed and is beyond the scope
of this study.


3.2 CONNECTIVITY ASSESSMENT
Lights Ferry/Snelling/Phil Neikro

One of the most pressing needs that has long been identified is the connectivity of the Lights Ferry
Road/Snelling Avenue/Phil Neikro Boulevard corridor that is critical in connecting the study area,
and locations beyond the study area, to I-985. This need was reaffirmed by input from the public
workshops and an evaluation of traffic patterns.

Old Town

The grid system that exists within the study area should be preserved and, where possible, continued.
The Pine Street extension, proposed as a part of a development in Old Town, is an example of this.
Other connections from Old Town to the large undeveloped tracts west of Gainesville Street will
also be important as that land develops in the future.


3.3 OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS

3.3.1 Intersection Operations
The intersection operational analysis is based on the criteria set forth in the Transportation
Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual 2000 (HCM2000). The purpose of the operational
analysis is to identify capacity and operational deficiencies of intersections within the roadway
network.

Signalized Intersections

For signalized intersections the operations are characterized by its capacity, expressed in terms
of a volume/capacity (v/c) ratio, and by Level of Service (LOS). A v/c ratio compares the demand
flow rate (volume) of traffic using the various lane groups at the intersection to the capacity of
those lane groups. This results in a v/c ratio for each lane group. A v/c ratio greater than 1.0
indicates the volume of traffic has exceeded the capacity available and indicates a temporary
excess of demand, which results in congestion.


                                                                                                            19
      Downtown Transportation Study

     NEEDS ASSESSMENT
     Level of Service for a signalized intersection is a qualitative measure and is expressed in terms
     of control delay per vehicle (in seconds per vehicle). Control delay depends upon a number of
     variables including traffic volumes, lane configuration, the quality of progression of traffic from
     adjacent intersections, the cycle length, and the ratio of green time to the cycle length. The LOS
     criteria for signalized intersections, based on control delay, are shown in Table 5. Level of Service
     A indicates operations with very low control delay while level of LOS F describes operations with
     extremely high control delay. LOS F is considered to be unacceptable to most drivers. LOS E is
     typically considered the limit of acceptable delay in urbanized areas and LOS D for non-urbanized
     areas.


      LOS            Control Delay per Vehicle (s/veh)

      A               10

      B              > 10-20

      C              > 20-35

      D              > 35-55

      E              > 55-80

      F              > 80
     Table 5. Level of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections


     Unsignalized Intersections

     Unsignalized intersections include all-way stop controlled (AWSC) intersections where each
     approach stops, and two-way stop control (TWSC) intersections where the side street or minor
     street is controlled by a stop sign. Unlike signalized intersections, a v/c ratio is not calculated.
     However, a control delay resulting in a Level of Service is calculated. The factors that can affect
     control delay, and therefore the LOS, of an unsignalized intersection, include the availability and
     distribution of gaps in the conflicting traffic stream (TWSC intersections), critical gaps (TWSC
     intersections), and follow-up time for a vehicle in the queue (TWSC and AWSC intersections).
     The LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections are shown in Table 6.

Operational Assessment

The existing condition LOS was evaluated for each intersection for which traffic data was available
(see Figures 11 and 12 for existing traffic counts). Future condition (year 2019) traffic volumes
were calculated using a 3% annual growth factor to evaluate 2019 traffic conditions. The 2019
volumes are shown in Figures 13 and 14. The results of the LOS analysis for both existing and
2019 conditions are shown in Table 7 that follows.

      Downtown Transportation Study

     NEEDS ASSESSMENT
     The LOS analysis shows that intersections within the study area currently operate at acceptable
     levels and will continue to do so in the mid-term without the addition of turn lanes or other capacity
     adding improvements. However, the LOS of an intersection does not tell the entire story. Based
     on input from the public and field observations, the following operational needs were identified:
     · Snelling Avenue/Atlanta Highway- With the current lane configuration and signal phasing
         northbound through traffic on Snelling Avenue often gets trapped behind left-turning traffic.
         The vertical alignment of Snelling Avenue, west of the railroad tracks, needs improvement.

     · Gainesville Street/Chattahoochee Street- the steep vertical alignment of Chattahoochee Street
       creates an undesirable condition which also impacts operations.


     3.3.2 Roadway Operations
     Mitchell Street

     Mitchell Street is a primary corridor used for access to Hideaway Bay Marina. This roadway
     is under designed to handle this type of traffic. Furthermore, Mitchell Street is a local street
     serving residential land uses. An improved connection from the Lights Ferry/Snelling/Phil Neikro
     corridor to the marina is needed.

     Jones Road

     Jones road is a two-way road that is only wide enough for one-way traffic. This road should be
     improved to properly handle two-way traffic or the City should consider other options including:
     restricting vehicle access from the Tidewater Cove subdivision or designating a portion of the
     roadway as one-way.


     3.4 BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN NEEDS ASSESSMENT
     Pedestrian and bicycle mobility are important modes of transportation to virtually any community.
     Within the study area these modes will become even more important as the focus of redevelopment
     in Old Town centers around pedestrian scale mixed-use development. Walking and bicycling
     can become viable options for shorter length trips, and reduce traffic on some portions of the
     roadway network, if future infrastructure improvements are designed to consider the need for
     these alternative modes.

     3.4.1 Pedestrian and Bicycle Needs
     The study area has a severe lack of sidewalks throughout, and no bike lanes. Additional sidewalks
     and bike lanes are both a current and a future need. The Comprehensive Plan identifies 51,185
     LF of sidewalk improvements, 8,894 LF of Greenways/Multi-use Trails, 86,014 LF of Bikeways,
     and 44,310LF of Bikeway loop within the City of Flowery Branch, most of which is located within
     the study area.

     It is not realistic, with the limited resources available to the City, that a plan be developed to
     install sidewalks or bike lanes on every street in the near term. However, a systematic approach to
     increasing the inventory of both should be undertaken. There are several ways that new sidewalks
     and/or bike lanes can be constructed. These include:

                                                                  Downtown Transportation Study

                                                         NEEDS ASSESSMENT
1.     As part of new development.
2.     As part of a streetscape project.
3.     As part of a major road improvement or construction of a new road.
4.     As a stand-alone construction project.

In prioritizing which pedestrian or bicycle facility to invest in first, it is important to understand
the characteristics of pedestrians and bicyclists. From a cost to benefit approach, it is more
desirable to invest in facilities that will have the highest usage. For example, the majority of
pedestrian trips are ¼ mile or less, with only 15% of trips being more than 2 miles. Though
pedestrian trips can occur anywhere (for instance, just walking the streets in your neighborhood),
it may make more sense to initially invest in sidewalks that are within ¼ mile of a destination such
as the commercial businesses in Old Town or a City park.

Bicycle trips are typically 30 minutes or less in length. However, they vary by distance and
purpose. Some typical trip types and lengths are as follows:

Entertainment, recreation, and fitness     18.6-24.9 mi.

Work                                       12.4 mi.

Shopping and trail access                  6.2 mi.

Of course safety issues for either pedestrians or bicyclists are a major factor that must be weighed
in any prioritization of investment.

                                                RECOMMENDATIONS                                      4
The recommendations presented in this section are intended to address the needs identified in
the Needs Assessment. While some recommendations are longer-term in nature, the intent is
to identify short-term (5 years or less) to mid-term (5 to 10 years) recommendations that are
achievable and realistic with consideration to funding. Recommendations have been divided into
the following categories:
· Connectivity/New Roadways
· Intersection Improvements
· Roadway improvements
· Pedestrian & Bicycle Improvements

Figure 15 at the end of this section depicts all of the recommendations.


4.1 CONNECTIVITY / NEW ROADWAYS

Though the recent economic situation has stalled development around the country, the potential for
new development in large undeveloped tracts adjacent to the historic core of Flowery Branch still
exists. And at some point in the future this property will be developed. This future development
should be connected back to the core of the city and to the adjacent arterial streets.
1.       Extend Lights Ferry Road to connect to Snelling Avenue (two-lane roadway). This
improvement has long been identified as an important connection for this area. As part of this
improvement the vertical alignment of Snelling Avenue, just north of the railroad tracks, should
be improved. The subject of grade separating Snelling Avenue at the railroad tracks has been
discussed for many years. The purpose would be to improve the flow of through traffic between
I-985 and McEver Road. In evaluating the feasibility of such a grade separation there are several
factors that must be considered.
· Physical Impact
    The physical impact to the character of the immediate area could be significant. For example,
    if the road were to go over the tracks the minimum clearance between top of track and the
    lowest point on the structure supporting the road is 23', if the road were to go under the
    tracks the minimum clearance is 17'-6" (not including the depth of the supporting structure).
    Whether passing over or under, the presence of a structure of this type would certainly affect
    the character of the historic Downtown.

· Cost
  The cost of a grade separation such as this is extremely high. A similar grade separation
  in Duluth, GA, completed in 2008, cost approximately $38 million, excluding right-of-way.
  Funding for a project of this nature would require State and Federal funds, along with local
  match.

· Available Alternative Route
  The planned Martin Road interchange on I-985 will provide a direct connection from
  McEver Road to I-985 by way of H. F. Reed Industrial Boulevard (which is already grade
  separated from the railroad). H. F. Reed Industrial Boulevard intersects with McEver Road
  approximately 2 miles north of the McEver Road/ Lights Ferry intersection. Because of this

                                                                                                         27
      Downtown Transportation Study

     RECOMMENDATIONS
          close proximity, the new Martin Road interchange will provide a viable alternative to Lights
          Ferry for accessing I-985. The original Interchange Justification Report (IJR) was approved
          for this project in 2001. Modifications to the original IJR are currently underway and will
          be resubmitted to the FHWA for approval. Funds for this project have been ear-marked for
          right-of-way acquisition. Preliminary engineering has not been completed to date.

     For these reasons, a grade separation of Snelling Avenue and the railroad is not recommended.

     2.     Provide a connection from Lights Ferry Road to Gainesville Street (two-lane roadway).
     This connection will provide another primary access point for Old Town and relieve some traffic
     on Lights Ferry Road/Snelling Avenue. The City has identified this roadway in the past as
     connecting into Gainesville Street at Pine Street. This location still seems to be the most viable.
     A roundabout should be considered as an option for the Pine Street/Gainesville Street/Connector
     Road intersection. A roundabout could create an excellent gateway to the historic downtown and
     provide a good transition from the two-way Connector road to Pine Street which is envisioned as
     one-way in the future.

     3.     Provide a connection from McEver Road to Gainesville Street (two-lane roadway). This
     connection would likely be a part of the development of the large tract that lies between McEver
     Road and Gainesville Street. Chattahoochee Street is the most likely connection point along
     Gainesville Street.

     4.      Pine Street extension (one lane roadway). This project has previously been identified as
     part of a development proposal for Old Town. The street should be extended as a one-way street
     with on-street parking. The cross section of this street should match that of Main Street.


     4.2 INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS

     The intersection improvements recommended in this section are based on either an operational
     analysis of the intersection, field observations, and/or comments from the public and City staff.
     1.      Snelling Avenue/Atlanta Highway.
             · Coordinate with the Georgia Department of Transportation to restripe the northwest
                bound Snelling Avenue approach to have a separate left-turn lane and a shared through/
                right-turn lane OR a separate left-turn, right-turn, and through lanes. This change will
                improve the projected LOS in 2019 from E to D.

     2.      Gainesville Street/Chattahoochee Street.
             · Modify Chattahoochee Street vertical alignment to improve approach grade and sight
                distance.
             · Modify signage and pavement markings to meet MUTCD requirements for height and
                location.
     3.     McEver Road/Gainesville Street/Jim Crow Road. (This project previously identified by
     Hall County Government but not funded)
            · Add left-turn lanes, all approaches
            · Add left-turn phases if warranted
            · Modify horizontal alignment

                                                          RECOMMENDATIONS
4.    McEver Road/Lights Ferry Road. (This project previously identified by Hall County
Government but not funded)
      · Add left-turn lanes, all approaches
      · Add left-turn phases if warranted
      · Modify horizontal alignment


4.3 ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS

The roadway improvements recommended deal primarily with operational and/or safety issues.
1.      Debbie Lane, Knight Drive, Mitchell Street (Main Street to Spring Street). These
streets are of sub-standard width. However, these streets carry very low traffic volumes and serve
primarily residential uses. While it would be ideal to eliminate all streets of sub-standard width, it
is recognized that the benefit in improved safety or capacity versus the cost to widen these streets,
is negligible. Therefore, widening these streets is not recommended as long as they are used in
the same manner as they are today. If development or traffic patterns change such that these
streets carry heavier volumes of traffic, then widening should be considered. In the interim, it is
recommended that the streets be signed as alleys to alert unfamiliar drivers to the fact that the
streets are narrow.

2.     Jones Road (short-term improvements currently planned for implementation by the City).
       · Widen to a standard width (24 ft. for a two-way roadway) from Mitchell Street to
          Lorimar Court
       · Redesignate Jones Road as one-way between Lorimar Court and Gainesville Street
3.     Jones Road (long-term improvement recommendation).
       · Widen to a standard width (24 ft. for a two-way roadway)
       · Realign the Jones Road/Mitchell Street intersection
       · Add sidewalks

4.     Mitchell Street. Serves as primary access to Hideaway Bay Marina and is therefore over
used given its current design.
       · Improve horizontal and vertical alignment
       · Add sidewalks


4.4 PEDESTRIAN & BICYCLE IMPROVEMENTS

It is unrealistic that the City will be able to fund all of the pedestrian and bicycle improvements
needed within the study area, and the City as a whole, in the near future. For this reason it
is recommended that a systematic approach to prioritizing investment in sidewalks and bicycle
facilities be employed.



                                                                                                         29
      Downtown Transportation Study

     RECOMMENDATIONS
     1.       Sidewalks that are within ¼ mile of a destination (i.e. a commercial area or a park) or
     that provide connectivity by serving as the missing segment between two existing sidewalk should
     be given a higher priority than stand alone, disconnected sidewalks.

     2.      Short segments of bike lane or bike lanes that are disconnected are undesirable as stand-
     alone projects.

     3.        Sidewalks and bike lanes should be included in the construction of all major roadway
     improvement projects, streetscape projects, and new roadway or development projects when called
     for by the Long-Range Bicycle and Pedestrian Improvement Program.

     4.     Though it is preferred that both sides of a road or street have sidewalks, consideration
     should be given to installing sidewalks on only one side of the road, in some instances, in order to
     provide greater coverage.

     Greenways/Multi-use Trails

     The Alberta Banks Park to City Park greenway/multi-use trail identified in the Comprehensive Plan
     would be an important amenity for the City. There was support for this multi-use trail connection
     from some residents that attended the public workshop. Currently, much of the land that the
     multi-use trail would pass through is undeveloped. It becomes significantly more complicated to
     design and construct a multi-use trail once property is developed. Therefore, it is recommended
     that the City coordinate with future developers to preserve right-of-way for the multi-use trail and,
     to the extent possible, link the multi-use trail with future development plans.

The City currently funds roadway maintenance and transportation projects from two sources-the
General Fund and the City's portion of the Hall County SPLOST VI program. Table X below shows
the funds the City has budgeted from the General Fund since 2006 for both roadway maintenance
and transportation projects along with the actual funds spent each year.



 Year                                 Budgeted                     Actual

 *Spring Street culvert project cost $149,999
Table 8. General Fund - Roadway Maintenance/Transportation Projects

Revenue that the City will receive from the SPLOST VI program is allocated to different areas,
not just transportation. For years 2010 through 2013, SPLOST VI funds are committed to non-
transportation projects. Therefore, SPLOST VI funds for transportation will not be available until
2014. The best case scenario is that the City could receive up to $250,000 a year for 2014 and
2015, depending on the amount of SPLOST dollars collected.
By comparison, Table 9 below shows the funds some other cities in the region have committed to
their transportation program.

Table 9. Funding Amounts Local Cities in Region have Committed to Their Transportation Program

Even after adjusting for population, it is evident that Flowery Branch, when compared to the
other cities in Table 9, is under-funded in order to maintain and improve the City's transportation
system. Currently the City is responsible for maintaining 24.2 miles of road.

     IMPLEMENTATION
     Implementation of the recommendations identified in this report has been divided into two sections:
     Opinion of Probable Cost and Funding Options.


     5.1 OPINION OF PROBABLE COST

     This section provides an opinion of probable cost for the recommendations identified in this study.
     The cost figures are based on past experience and general costs for similar type work. All costs
     are based on 2010 dollars and do not include any necesary right-of-way acquisition. See Table 10
     at the end of this section for opinion of probable cost.


     5.2 FUNDING OPTIONS

     This section provides a description of funding resources that may be accessed to implement
     infrastructure projects.

     Local Maintenance and Improvement Grant (LMIG)

     Under Senate Bill 200, signed into law on May 11, 2009, the Local Maintenance and Improvement
     Grant (LMIG) program replaces funds formerly available under the Local Assistance Road Program
     (LARP) and State-Aid Program. LMIG will roll out in FY 2011 (July 2010). Guidelines and
     criteria for the program will be sent to local governments in the spring of 2010. SB 200 requires
     that funds under the LMIG program be allocated according to a funding formula that will take into
     consideration paved and unpaved lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and may include population,
     employment, local funding matches available, as well as other factors. Funds allocated for the
     LMIG program will be not less than 10% or more than 20% of the money derived from the motor
     fuel taxes received by the State in the previous year.

     Eligible Activities: Anticipated to be the same as under LARP and State-Aid.
     · LARP - leveling and resurfacing of existing roads
     · State Aid - used for a variety of local transportation projects including sidewalks, safety-related
         projects, bridge and drainage projects, and projects that promote economic development.

     Transportation Enhancement Program (TE)

     The TE program is federally funded and is administered by the Georgia Department of
     Transportation. Cities can apply for up to $1 million in federal TE grant funds, and a minimum
     local match of 20% is required. Funds are awarded through a competitive process.

                                                             IMPLEMENTATION
Eligible Activities: Eligible activities fall under four broad categories:
· Multi-use facilities (trails and bicycle lanes)
· Transportation aesthetics (streetscapes and landscaping)
· Historic preservation of transportation related facilities (railroad depots)
· Scenic preservation of views and scenic byways

Georgia Transportation Enhancement (GATEway) Grant Program

Funding comes from contributory value fees paid by outdoor advertising companies to the Georgia
Department of Transportation for vegetation removal at outdoor advertising signs. The maximum
fund allotment for a government entity is $50,000.

Eligible Activities: May be used for landscape materials and installation in State right-of-way.

Georgia Transportation Infrastructure Bank (GTIB)

The GTIB is a revolving infrastructure investment fund that provides loans with attractive terms
to eligible state, regional, and local government entities to fund eligible transportation projects.
The GTIB also offers grants, but at the current time the grant program is restricted to Community
Improvement Districts that are formally recognized by the State of Georgia. The GTIB operates
under the authority of the State Road and Tollway Authority (SRTA). Initial funding for the GTIB
loan program is $33.1 million and $10 million for the grant program. The GTIB began accepting
applications on October 1, 2009.

The minimum loan amount that may be requested is $25,000 and the maximum amount is 25% of
the annual GTIB appropriation. The initial maximum limit is $8,275,000 (25% of $33.1 million).
The minimum loan term is 5 years though loans may be prepaid without penalty. The maximum
loan term is the lesser of 25 years or the useful life of the project. Though a percentage is not
stipulated, it is strongly encouraged that matching funds be used for a portion of the project's
financing.

Eligible Activities:
· Eligible costs include: preliminary engineering, traffic and revenue studies, environmental
    studies, right of way acquisition, legal and financial services associated with the development
    of the qualified project, construction, construction management, facilities, and other costs
    associated with the qualified project.
· Eligible projects include those roadway projects that satisfy the requirements of being "motor
    fuel tax eligible", as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 32-1-1 et seq.




                                                                                                       35

     IMPLEMENTATION
     State/Local Highway Safety Program

     The Governor's Office of Highway Safety (GOHS) provides grants to assist local governments
     in addressing highway safety deficiencies. Funds are granted on an annual basis according to
     availability. Previous year's traffic crash data is used to evaluate a relative ranking of each
     jurisdiction statewide to prioritize funds.

     Eligible Activities: Varies-safety related.

     Safe Routes to School Program (SRTS)

     The SRTS program is federally funded and administered by GDOT. The program's goal is to
     increase the number of children in grades K-8 who bicycle and walk to school. Specifically the
     goals are:
     · Promote walking/biking as a safe and more appealing transportation alternative.
     · Encourage and enable children to more safely walk and bicycle to school.
     · Promote healthy and active lifestyles at an early age.
     · Implement projects and activities that will improve safety and reduce traffic, fuel consumption,
         and air pollution in the vicinity of schools.

     SRTS funding is awarded through a competitive "Call for Projects" process. The maximum
     amount awarded per project is $500,000.

     Eligible Activities: Sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian signals, etc.

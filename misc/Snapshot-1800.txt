Subject:          Marshside at Groover Branch ­ Intersection Analysis of Additional 95 Single Family Homes

Date:             December 4, 2012 - Revised


Lassiter Transportation Group, Inc. (LTG) has conducted an analysis of the potential impact to the a.m. peak-hour
traffic at the Airport Road/Tymber Creek Road intersection due to the proposed additional 95 single family homes
for the Marshside at Groover Branch residential development (see Exhibit A). This development is located in the
northwest quadrant of the Airport Road/Tymber Creek Road intersection. The site location map is presented in
Figure 1.

The analysis presented below is based on the prior traffic study conducted by LTG in October of 2005 for the
previously approved 68 single family homes of Marshside at Groover Branch. The distribution pattern used in the
prior study is used again in this study; however, new traffic counts were collected at the intersection during the
a.m. peak-hour (see Exhibits B-1 through B-4).

Existing Conditions

The first step was to analyze the existing intersection operations during the a.m. peak-hour. The Highway
Capacity Software was used to determine the peak-hour operations. This procedure compares travel demand
through an intersection to the ability of the traffic signal to accommodate that traffic based on the number of lanes
and the traffic signal timing.

Table 1 below presents that results of the analysis using the existing traffic counts indicated above (the actual
printout from the HCS is attached in Exhibit C). Those counts are also presented in the left side of Figure 2.

                Airport Road at Tymber Creek Road               E     18.1      B       No

As indicated above, the existing intersection operation is at level of service (LOS) B during the a.m. peak-hour.
The adopted LOS for this intersection is LOS E. Therefore, the existing operation is well within the established
maximum service level.

Future Conditions

In order to assess the future a.m. peak-hour operation of the Airport Road/Tymber Creek Road intersection with
the addition of 95 single family homes, the a.m. peak-hour trips from the proposed development are determined,
the growth in background traffic is projected, the total trips are then assigned through the intersection and the
intersection's operation is then analyzed to determine the future level of service. The assignment of traffic was
modified to include a separate right-turn, exit-only drive from the project onto Tymber Creek Road, located
approximately 527 ft. north of the project's southern boundary. This driveway has been proposed to minimize the
loading of project trips onto Airport Road west of Tymber Creek Road which is heavily impacted by the a.m. peak
school traffic generated by Pathways Elementary School (see Exhibit D).

Trip Generation ­ The trip generation for the 95 additional single family homes is presented in Table 2. The
source of the trip generation rates is the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) document Trip Generation, 8th
Edition. As indicated below, an estimated 76 additional a.m. peak-hour trips are projected due to the proposed
development. These additional 76 trips represent only 2.9% of the overall project future traffic volume, including
the trips from vested development. This data is also reflected in the traffic assignment on the right side of Figure
2.

Background Traffic Growth Projections ­ Other development has been approved, but not developed, in the vicinity
of the proposed development. Daily traffic projections from this additional approved development, called vested
growth trips, were obtained from the City of Ormond Beach. That daily data (attached in Exhibit E) was converted
to develop projected traffic growth for the a.m. peak-hour. The results of the vested growth projections are also
shown in the right side of Figure 2.

It was further noted that the traffic volumes on both Tymber Creek Road and on Airport Road have steadily
declined since the 2005 study was conducted. Tymber Creek Road daily counts have reduced by 12% percent
over the six years from 2005 to 2011 while the Airport Road daily counts have reduced by 26% over the same
time period (see Exhibit F). Accordingly, no additional growth rates were applied to the existing counts.

Trip Distribution/Assignment ­ The trip distribution pattern for the proposed additional 95 single family homes was
determined using the Central Florida Regional Planning Model (CFRPM), Version IV. This model predicts travel
routes based on complementary land uses (trip destinations) from a residential development that include places
of employment, shopping, schools, personal business, etc. The trip distribution pattern used in this analysis was
obtained from the prior study for the original 68-unit development (see Exhibit G). A.M. peak-hour trips from the
proposed development were then assigned to the various traffic movements at the intersection based on these
distribution patterns, including the proposed right-turn, exit-only drive connecting to Tymber Creek Rd.

Future Conditions Analysis ­ The capacity analysis of the future traffic volumes with the proposed additional units
of Marshside at Groover Branch and the vested growth trips was performed using the current roadway
configuration at the Airport Road/Tymber Creek intersection. As indicated in Table 3, the anticipated level of
service with the addition of the future traffic results in a peak-hour operation of LOS D (the HCS printout is
attached as Exhibit H). This level of service is also within the adopted LOS range. It should be noted that
additional improvements to this intersection have been design by Volusia County that will further improve the
intersection operation. Those improvements were not assumed, however, in this analysis as they are not funded
for construction in the next three years.

Summary

This Technical Memorandum assesses the a.m. peak-hour traffic impact of an additional 95 residential units
proposed for the Marshside at Groover Branch residential development. The developer has proposed a right-
turn, exit-only drive onto Tymber Creek Road to shift traffic away from Airport Road which experiences heavy
congestion from 7:30 a.m. until 8:10 a.m. due to arrivals and departures from Pathways Elementary School and
Pinetree Elementary School. This shift in traffic reduces the congestion on Airport Road west of Tymber Creek
Road by shifting the traffic to the least heavily travelled intersection approach ­ southbound Tymber Creek Road.

According to the analysis, with the increase in traffic volumes, the intersection of Airport Road/Tymber Creek
Road remains within the adopted operational service level.

Steve ­ Can you get me the vested trips affecting this intersection?  We are conducting the a.m. peakhour analysis 
requested of the Marshside Developer by Ric Goss.  Our goal is to provide this analysis by next Wednesday. 
 
Thanks for your help!

A.      INTRODUCTION
LSA Associates, Inc. (LSA) has prepared this Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) to identify the potential
traffic impacts resulting from the proposed improvements to the existing East Campus Sports Fields
(project) located in the City of Berkeley. LSA has prepared this TIA consistent with the applicable
provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the requirements of the City of
Berkeley (City). Figure 1 shows the location of the proposed project and the study area intersections
analyzed in this report. Issues addressed in this analysis include off-site intersection operation and
parking supply. The project's potential effect on pedestrian and bicycle facilities and transit service is
also discussed. The traffic analysis for the proposed project examines six scenarios:

1. Existing conditions
2. Existing Plus Project conditions
3. Future (2011) conditions
4. Future (2011) Plus Project conditions
5. Cumulative (2035) conditions
6. Cumulative (2035) Plus Project conditions

Prior to preparation of this traffic analysis, LSA submitted the scope of work to City staff for review.
Changes to the scope, as requested by City staff, were incorporated before the initiation of this
analysis.


Project Description. The existing project site is located on the block bounded by Carleton Street to
the north, Milvia Street to the east, Derby Street to the south, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Way to the
west. The approximately 3.5-acre field occupies the majority of the block. Berkeley High School is
the primary user of the field, which has no permanently fixed sports infrastructure (e.g., soccer nets,
field goal posts) and thereby allowing a variety of sport uses. The existing field is currently used as a
practice area for Berkeley High School sports teams. The proposed project would include the
realignment of Derby Street to allow for the redevelopment of the field to accommodate a baseball
field, a basketball court, and a multipurpose field. Derby Street would be striped to provide
approximately 33 parallel spaces and 40 angled parking spaces. Figure 2 illustrates the conceptual site
plan of the proposed project. Pedestrian access to the field is provided near the northwest and
southeast corner of the field.

As the primary users of the existing and proposed sports fields are associated with Berkeley High
School, the fields would typically be used (occupied) only during the afternoon hours (3:00 p.m. to
7:00 p.m.). Informal use of the fields may occur during the morning hours; however, the use of the
fields in the morning would be similar to the existing informal use of the field during the AM peak
hours. Hence the traffic impact analysis on the adjacent intersections (study area intersections) was
conducted only for the PM peak hour of street traffic, which occurs between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.

B.      METHODOLOGY
1.      Study Area Intersections
As requested by the City of Berkeley staff, the study area analyzed in this report includes the
intersections listed below. Figure 3 provides the existing geometrics and traffic control devices at
each study area intersection.

6. Milvia Street/Carleton Street
7. Milvia Street/Derby Street
8. Shattuck Avenue/Carleton Street
9. Shattuck Avenue/Derby Street

2.      Intersection Level of Service Methodology
Roadway operations and the relationship between capacity and traffic volumes are generally
expressed in terms of levels of service (LOS), which are defined using the letter grades A through F.
A complete description of the meaning of LOS can be found in the Transportation Research Board
Special Report 209, Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), and is briefly described in Table 1. These
levels recognize that the conditions motorists experience rapidly deteriorate as traffic approaches the
capacity of a given intersection. Under such conditions congestion is experienced. There is general
instability in the traffic flow, and relatively small incidents (e.g., a momentary engine stall) can cause
considerable fluctuations in speed and delay. This near-capacity situation is labeled LOS E. Beyond
LOS E an intersection's capacity has been exceeded, and additional traffic at the intersection cannot
be accommodated. Upstream queues will then form and continue to expand in length until the
demand volume declines.

All study area intersections were analyzed using the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (2000 HCM)
analysis methodologies. LOS at all intersections were calculated using Traffix 8.0 software.

The 2000 HCM methodology was used to determine intersection LOS at both signalized and
unsignalized intersections. For the signalized HCM methodology, the LOS is presented in terms of
average intersection delay for all approaches. For the unsignalized HCM methodology, the LOS is
presented in terms of total intersection delay for all approaches (at four-way stop intersections) and
approach delay of the major and minor streets (at two-way stop intersections) in seconds per vehicle.
The relationships of delay and LOS for both signalized and unsignalized intersections are summarized
in Table 2.

    LOS                                                        Description
            No approach phase is fully utilized by traffic and no vehicle waits longer than one red indication. Typically, the
     A
            approach appears quite open, turns are made easily, and nearly all drivers find freedom of operation.
            This service level represents stable operation, where an occasional approach phase is fully utilized and a
     B
            substantial number are approaching full use. Many drivers begin to feel restricted within platoons of vehicles.
            This level still represents stable operating conditions. Occasionally, drivers may have to wait through more than
     C      one red signal indication, and backups may develop behind turning vehicles. Most drivers feel somewhat
            restricted but not objectionably so.
            This level encompasses a zone of increasing restriction approaching instability at the intersection. Delays to
     D      approaching vehicles may be substantial during short peaks within the peak period; however, enough cycles with
            lower demand occur to permit periodic clearance of developing queues, thus preventing excessive backups.
            Capacity occurs at the upper end of this service level. It represents the most vehicles that any particular
     E      intersection approach can accommodate. Full utilization of every signal cycle is seldom attained no matter how
            great the demand.
            This level describes forced flow operations at low speeds, where volumes exceed capacity. These conditions
            usually result from queues of vehicles backing up from a restriction downstream. Speeds are reduced
     F
            substantially and stoppages may occur for short or long periods of time due to the congestion. In the extreme
            case, both speed and volume can drop to zero.

3.         Significance Criteria
The City of Berkeley has guidelines for development of traffic impact studies, which include
established thresholds of significance to determine if a proposed project would result in a significant
impact.


Signalized Intersections. For signalized and all-way stopped controlled intersections, the following
thresholds exist.
·        Intersection operations degrade from LOS D to LOS E and more than a 2-second increase in
         delay; or
·        Intersection operations degrade from LOS E to LOS F and more than a 3-second increase in delay

                                                                           BERKELEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT




Unsignalized Intersections. The LOS thresholds for LOS D and E for unsignalized intersections are
35 and 50 seconds, respectively. For two-way stop intersections, LOS are established separately for
each movement with conflicting movements that pass through the intersection. As a result, an
unfavorable LOS can occur for a small number of vehicles, and a large increase in delay can occur for
a small increase in traffic volume. Unlike for signalized intersections, it is difficult to establish fixed
significance thresholds for unsignalized intersections, particularly those with only side-street stop
control. In general, mitigations are required if a movement is at LOS F, the peak-hour signal warrant
is met, and a minimum of 10 vehicles is added to the critical movement. Nevertheless, as delays
increase dramatically once LOS F is reached, consideration should be given to the number of new
trips added by a project and other factors, such as the feasibility of alternative routes and the
proximity of adjacent traffic signals.

·    Ward Street. Ward Street is located one block south of the project site. This roadway is a local
     street that extends in an east-west direction. In the vicinity of the project, the roadway is a two-
     lane facility with a posted speed limit of 25 mph and parallel on-street parking on both sides of
     the street.

2.      Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
The City of Berkeley Bicycle Plan describes the system of bicycle facilities throughout the City. The
system is more extensive than the traditional three-tired system of Class III bicycle routes (signed but
with no designated lane), Class II lanes (bike lanes with signage), and Class I paths (dedicated for
bicycle use and separated from vehicular traffic). The Berkeley system also includes bicycle
boulevards (streets with bicycle priority) and Class 2.5 routes (upgraded Class II facilities with
targeted improvements), in addition to the traditional Class I, II, and III bicycle routes described
above.

In the vicinity of the project, the City's Bicycle Plan identifies Milvia Street as a bicycle boulevard,
and Parker Street as a Class 2.5 facility.

All streets in the vicinity of the project have sidewalks on both sides of the streets. One or more
marked crosswalks are provided at all study intersections along Martin Luther King, Jr. Way and
Shattuck Avenue.

3.      Public Transportation
Local bus service is provided by Alameda-Contra Costa Transit (AC Transit). AC Transit currently
operates three fixed routes that serve the project site.

AC Transit Route 15 runs along Martin Luther King, Jr. Way and provides the most direct access to
the project site. Route 15 provides service from the west entrance of the University of California at
Berkeley to the 11th Street/Jefferson Street intersection in Oakland. This route has a headway of 20 to
30 minutes and runs from 5:50 a.m. to 9:50 p.m. on weekdays. The nearest bus stop to the project site
is at the of Martin Luther King, Jr. Way/Derby Street intersection.

AC Transit Route 18 runs along Shattuck Avenue and provides service from the San Pablo Avenue/
Marin Avenue intersection in Albany to the Mountain Boulevard/Moraga Avenue in Oakland. This
route has a headway of 10 to 30 minutes and runs from 5:00 a.m. to 12:20 a.m. on weekdays.

AC Transit Route F runs along Shattuck Avenue and provides service from Berkeley (Bancroft Way/
Telegraph Avenue intersection) to San Francisco (Transbay Terminal). This route has a headway of
20 to 30 minutes and runs from 6:00 a.m. to 12:45 a.m. on weekdays.

Regional transportation in Berkeley is provided by Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). The Ashby and
Downtown Berkeley BART stations are the closest stations to the project site. The Ashby BART
station is located six blocks (approximately 1/2 mile) south of the project site. AC Transit Route 15
provides direct access between the project site and the Ashby BART station. The Downtown
Berkeley BART station is located approximately 1 mile northeast of the project site. AC Transit

4.      Existing Intersection Volume and Level of Service Analysis
LSA contracted with a private car counting company (All Traffic Data [ATD]) to conduct AM and
PM peak-hour turn movement volumes at the nine study area intersections Wednesday,
September 16, 2009. Figure 4 illustrates the existing AM and PM traffic volumes at the study area
intersections. The existing traffic counts are provided in Appendix A.

Existing LOS was calculated for each of the study area intersections. Table 3 summarizes the results
of the existing AM and PM peak-hour LOS analysis for the nine study area intersections. The existing
LOS calculation worksheets are contained in Appendix B. As Table 3 indicates, all signalized and all-
way stop-controlled study intersections operate at LOS A. All side street stop-controlled intersections
operate with an average intersection delay (average of all turning movements) equivalent to LOS C or
better in both AM and PM peak hours.

D.      FUTURE (2011) BASELINE CONDITIONS
According to the Berkeley Unified School District (District), the proposed redevelopment of the East
Campus Sports Fields will be completed by 2010. The year 2011 was analyzed to provide a more
conservative analysis of opening year conditions. This approach allows for delays in construction that
could push the project opening to 2011. To determine Future (2011) conditions, traffic volumes for
other committed and/or approved developments were added to the existing baseline traffic volumes.
In addition, a growth factor of 0.5 percent per year was added to the existing baseline traffic volumes
to account for ambient growth in traffic.

Eight approved projects were identified by City staff for inclusion in the Future (2011) conditions.
The following development projects are being proposed in the vicinity of the project:
·    3075 Adeline Street: 86,057 square feet of retail use that includes disability organizations,
     childcare, a café, and a fitness center.
·    2323 Shattuck Avenue: Mixed-use facility that includes a 3,000 square feet restaurant with beer
     and wine service, 2,609 square feet of retail use, and 16 apartment units.
·    2701 Shattuck Avenue: Mixed-use building that includes 3,198 square feet of retail use and 24
     apartment units.
·    2711 Shattuck Avenue: Mixed-use building that includes 585 square feet of retail use and a 28-
     room extended stay hotel.
·    2489 Martin Luther King, Jr. Way: Mixed-use building that includes 1,725 square feet of retail
     use and 21 apartment units.
·    3001 Telegraph Road: Mixed-use building that includes 4,039 square feet of retail use and 38
     apartment units.
·    1885 University Avenue: Mixed-use building that includes 14,390 square feet of retail use and
     148 apartment units.
·    2600 Shattuck Avenue: Mixed-use building that includes 23,354 square feet of retail use and
     155 apartment units.

Figure 5 illustrates the location of the cumulative projects. The project trip generation for the
approved/pending projects was calculated using trip rates documented in the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation manual (7th Edition) and is presented in Table 4.
The cumulative projects' traffic was assigned to local streets based on the location of the cumulative
projects in relation to local and regional distribution.

Future (2011) Conditions Intersection Level of Service Analysis. As discussed previously, the
traffic impact analysis was only conducted for the PM peak hour because the proposed project is not
expected to generate substantial numbers of new vehicle trips during the AM peak hour. The Future
(2011) conditions PM peak-hour traffic volumes are shown on Figure 6. Table 5 summarizes the
results of the future PM peak-hour LOS analysis for all study area intersections. The LOS worksheets
are provided in Appendix C. As Table 5 indicates, all signalized and all-way stop-controlled study
intersections would operate at LOS A. All side street stop-controlled intersections would operate with
an average intersection delay (average of all turning movements) equivalent to LOS C or better in the
PM peak hour.

E.         CUMULATIVE (2035) CONDITIONS
LSA developed future traffic forecasts using data from the Countywide Travel Demand Model, which
is maintained by the Alameda County Congestion Management Agency (ACCMA). The traffic
forecasts for the base year (2000) and future year (2035) are available on the ACCMA website,1
which was updated in October 2008. The peak-hour traffic volumes along Martin Luther King, Jr.
Way and Shattuck Avenue in the vicinity of the project site were used to develop annual growth rates
between base year (2000) and future year (2035) traffic forecasts. Based on these forecasts, the traffic
in the vicinity of the East Campus Sports Field is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 0.25
percent per year. Hence the total growth in traffic between 2009 and 2035 would be 6.5 percent. This
growth was applied to the existing 2009 PM peak-hour counts to develop Cumulative (2035)
Conditions PM peak-hour traffic volumes. Figure 7 illustrates the Cumulative (2035) PM peak-hour
traffic volumes.

According to City of Berkeley staff, one approved development project (listed below) was not
included in the countywide travel demand model which was used to develop forecast traffic volume
for the 2035 conditions. Hence the trips generated by this approved development project were
manually added to the future 2035 peak-hour traffic volumes.

F.         PROJECT IMPACTS
1.         Trip Generation
The project trip generation was developed based on the maximum recreation use assumption for the
East Campus Sports Field (project site) and mode splits (driving vs. walking) that were estimated
based on surveys conducted at a similar sports field in the region. For the purpose of this analysis, it
was assumed that the maximum recreational use of the fields would occur when there is a District
baseball game occurring simultaneously with basketball court activity. During these occasions it is
assumed there would be a total of 34 baseball players (both teams combined), 4 coaches, 50 baseball
spectators, and 12 basketball players, which is a total of 100 people.

LSA surveyed the existing sports field at Memorial Park in the City of Albany. This facility was
selected because of its similarity to the proposed East Campus Sports Fields. The sports field at
Memorial Park is also similar to the proposed project in that Albany High School is adjacent to
Memorial Park and utilizes the field for practice, just as Berkeley High School will use the field at the
proposed project. ATD, an independent traffic count and survey firm, visited the sports field at
Memorial Park on a typical weekday from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. to collect a variety of data. ATD
counted the number of incoming vehicles that parked, the number of vehicles that stopped to drop off
people, the number of people (occupancy) in each vehicle, and the number of people walking to the
sports field. The data was collected in 15-minute intervals. Survey data is presented in Appendix E.

The weekday survey data were then used to estimate the total number of vehicles entering and exiting
the sports field between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. Based on the survey data, the peak activity on the
field occurred between 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., but the peak hour of traffic on adjacent streets and
intersections occurs between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. Therefore, the trips generated by the sports field
at Memorial Park between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. were used to derive trip estimates for the proposed
project. Table 7 summarizes the survey data between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. (peak hour of adjacent
street traffic) for the sports field at Memorial Park. As shown in Table 7, the total number of vehicles
destined to and leaving the sports field between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. was 28 (25 inbound and 3
outbound). The number of people driving and parking to attend events at the sports field was 48. It
should be noted that the average vehicle occupancy was approximately two people; therefore, the
number of people driving (48 people) is approximately twice the number of cars (25) or trips in the
peak hour. The number of people were dropped off at the sports field was three, and people walking
to the sports field was 84. The total number of people going to the sports field between 5:00 p.m. and
6:00 p.m. was 135.

Based on the survey of the sports field at Memorial Park, 28 vehicle trips were generated by 135
people. This proportionality developed from the surveys was applied to the forecast of 100 people
(expected to be the maximum recreational use of the proposed project) to develop traffic generation
for the proposed project. The trip generation for the proposed project is shown in Table 8.

2.      Trip Distribution and Assignment
Trip distribution is defined as the directions of approach and departure that vehicles would use to
arrive and depart from the site. The project trips were distributed based on existing traffic patterns and
residential distributions within the City of Berkeley. Approximately 35 percent of the trips are
destined north via Martin Luther King, Jr. Way; 15 percent north via Shattuck Avenue; 20 percent
south via Martin Luther King, Jr. Way; 5 percent south via Shattuck Avenue; 5 percent south via
Milvia Street; 10 percent west via Carleton Street and Derby Street; and 10 percent east via Carleton
Street and Derby Street. Figure 8 shows the regional trip distribution and assignment for the proposed
project.


G.      EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
Traffic generated by the proposed project was added to the existing traffic volumes at the study area
intersections. Figure 9 shows the resulting Existing Plus Project PM peak-hour traffic volumes.

Existing Plus Project Intersection Level of Service Analysis. Table 9 summarizes the results of the
Existing Plus Project PM peak-hour LOS analysis for all study area intersections. The LOS
worksheets are provided in Appendix F. As this table indicates, all study area intersections will
continue to operate at an acceptable LOS (i.e., LOS D or better) in the PM peak hour with
implementation of the proposed project. Based on the significance criteria discussed previously, the
project will not create significant impacts at any of the study area intersections in the Existing Plus
Project conditions as study area intersections are projected to operate at acceptable LOS based on the
average intersection delay. Three intersections with side street stop control (Martin Luther King, Jr.
Way/Parker Street, Martin Luther King, Jr. Way/Ward Street, and Shattuck Avenue/Carleton Street)
will continue to have an average side street delay more than 45 seconds (LOS E or F) with the
addition of the project. Per the significance criteria for side street stop controlled intersections, these
intersections are not significantly impacted by the project as the project adds fewer than 10 trips to the
critical movement at each of these intersections, and the volume on the side streets does not satisfy
the peak hour volume requirement (100 vehicles for one side street approach) for warranting a signal
at these locations.


H.      FUTURE (2011) PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
Traffic generated by the project was added to the Future (2011) traffic volumes at each study area
intersection. Figure 10 illustrates the resulting Future (2011) Plus Project PM peak-hour traffic
volumes.


Future (2011) Plus Project Intersection Level of Service Summary Analysis. Table 10
summarizes the results of the Future Plus Project PM peak-hour LOS analysis for all study area
intersections. The LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix G. As this table indicates, all study area
intersections would continue to operate at an acceptable LOS (i.e., LOS D or better) in the PM peak
hour. Based on the significance criteria discussed previously, the project would not create significant
impacts at any of the study area intersections in the Future (2011) Plus Project conditions. The study
area intersections are projected to operate at acceptable LOS (LOS D or better) based on the average

intersection delay. Three intersections with side-street stop control (Martin Luther King, Jr. Way/
Parker Street, Martin Luther King, Jr. Way/Ward Street, and Shattuck Avenue/Carleton Street) would
continue to have an average side street delay of more than 45 seconds (LOS E or F) with the addition
of the project. Per the significance criteria for side-street stop-controlled intersections, these
intersections would not be significantly impacted by the project because the project would add fewer
than 10 trips to the critical movement at each of these intersections and the volume on the side streets
would not satisfy the peak-hour volume requirement (100 vehicles for one side street approach) for a
signal at these locations.


I.      CUMULATIVE (2035) PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
Traffic generated by the project was added to the Cumulative (2035) traffic volumes at each study
area intersection. Figure 11 illustrates the resulting Cumulative (2035) Plus Project PM peak-hour

Cumulative (2035) Plus Project Intersection Level of Service Analysis. Table 11 summarizes the
results of the Cumulative (2035) Plus Project PM peak-hour LOS analysis for all study area
intersections. The LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix H. As this table indicates, all study area
intersections would continue to operate at an acceptable LOS (i.e., LOS D or better) in the PM peak
hour with the proposed project, with the exception of the intersection of Shattuck Avenue/Carleton
Street, which would operate with an average intersection delay of 40.4 seconds. Based on the
significance criteria discussed previously, the project would not create significant impacts at any of
the study area intersections in the Cumulative (2035) Plus Project conditions. Three intersections with
side-street stop control (Martin Luther King, Jr. Way/Parker Street, Martin Luther King, Jr. Way/
Ward Street, and Shattuck Avenue/Carleton Street) would continue to have an average side street
delay of more than 50 seconds (LOS F) with the addition of the project. Per the significance criteria
for side-street stop-controlled intersections, these intersections would not be significantly impacted by
the project because the project would add fewer than 10 trips to the critical movement at each of these
intersections and the volume on the side streets would not satisfy the peak-hour volume requirement
(100 vehicles for one side street approach) for a signal at these locations.

J.      PARKING ANALYSIS
1.      Existing Conditions
On-street parking (parallel and/or angled) is available along all the street segments in the vicinity of
the project site. Parking utilization surveys were conducted for several city blocks within the area
bounded by and including Parker Street to the north, Ward Street to the south, Grant Street to the
west, and Shattuck Avenue to the east. The area selected for the parking survey was within walking
distance (one block in each direction) from the project site. Figure 1 illustrates the boundary for the
parking surveys. The surveys documented the existing parking supply and the demand for a typical
weekday and Saturday. The parking surveys were conducted to capture two events that are anticipated
to have high parking utilization in the vicinity of the project. One event occurs on Tuesdays from 2:00
p.m. to 7:00 p.m. during the hours of operation of the Farmers' Market. The second event corresponds
to the estimated peak of Saturday athletic activity (from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.).The parking surveys
are provided in Appendix I.

The number of vehicles parked on Grant Street, Martin Luther King, Jr. Way, Milvia Street, Shattuck
Avenue, Ward Street, Derby Street, Carleton Street, and Parker Street were counted. Table 12
displays the available parking spaces for each street segment.

The total number of parking spaces available in the surveyed area is 813 spaces. Even though there
are 813 parking spaces in the surveyed area, only 747 spaces are available when the Farmers' Market
is open (every Tuesday). During Farmers' Market parking is prohibited along Derby Street between
Martin Luther King Jr. Way and Milvia Street, which has 66 parking spaces. Based on the parking
surveys, the peak parking demand during the Tuesday Farmers' Market was 730 spaces at 2:00 p.m.
On Saturday, a peak parking demand of 312 spaces was observed at 11:30 a.m. The parking surveys
are summarized in Table 13. The observed (existing) Tuesday parking demand and Saturday parking
demand are illustrated in Figures 12 and 13, respectively.

The peak parking demand of 730 spaces on a weekday represents 98 percent of the total available
parking supply of 747 spaces, leaving 2 percent of the total spaces unoccupied. The peak parking
demand of 312 spaces on a weekend represents 38 percent of the total parking supply of 813 spaces,
leaving approximately 62 percent of the total spaces unoccupied.

2.      Existing Plus Project Conditions
The existing segment of Derby Street between Milvia Street and Martin Luther King, Jr. Way is a
straight roadway segment. On-street parking with 28 parallel parking spaces on the north side and 38
angled spaces on the south side (total of 66 spaces) are provided along this segment of Derby Street.
As a part of the proposed project, the eastern portion of this segment of Derby Street would be curved
southward, as illustrated in Figure 2. Due to this realignment, the parking configuration along this
segment of Derby Street would change.

With the proposed project, this segment of Derby Street will have 33 parallel parking spaces on the
north side and 40 angled spaces on the south side (total of 73 spaces). Therefore, the total number of
parking spaces available in the area survey (one block from the project boundary) would increase
from 813 spaces to 820 spaces.

The parking requirement for the proposed project was estimated based on the average vehicle
occupancy and the number of people that will use the sports field under the maximum recreational
use condition. The average vehicle occupancy based on the surveys conducted at the sports field at
Memorial Park in the City of Albany is 2.37 persons per vehicle. Excel worksheets (calculations of
average vehicle occupancy) are provided in Appendix I. As discussed in the trip generation section of
this study (Table 7), the total number of field users at Memorial Park during the time of surveys was
135, of which 51 arrive in vehicles (48 park +3 drop-off) and 84 walk. Hence 36 percent
[(48*100)/135] of the total people attending the events will park their vehicles at the sports field. The

recreational use will be 15 spaces (36/2.37). Note that the majority of the people attending activities
will walk to the sports field (e.g., Berkeley High School students).

For the Existing Plus Project conditions, the peak parking demand during a Tuesday Farmers' Market
would be 745 spaces [730 (existing) + 15 (sports field)] at 2:00 p.m. On Saturday, the peak parking
demand would be 327 spaces [312 (existing) + 15 (sports field)] at 11:30 a.m. The parking demand
with the proposed project is shown in Table 14. The existing plus project Tuesday peak parking
demand and Saturday peak parking demand are illustrated in Figures 14 and 15, respectively.

The peak parking demand of 745 spaces on a weekday represents 99 percent of the total parking
supply of 747 spaces, leaving a parking buffer of 1 percent available. The peak parking demand of
327 spaces on a weekend represents 40 percent of the total parking supply of 820 spaces, leaving a
peak parking buffer of approximately 60 percent available.

The mode splits for the project trips were calculated based on surveys conducted during a weekday
which cannot be applied to the weekend (Saturday) event. It is unlikely that students would have the
same walk percentage on a Saturday as they would be arriving from their homes rather than possibly
walking from school. Therefore a worst case parking scenario was reviewed for the weekend
conditions. Based on parking analysis for weekend (Saturday), approximately 60 % (493 spaces) will
be available in the vicinity of the project. Hence, in a worst case scenario if all the project related
traffic (maximum of 100 people) travel individually by car (100 vehicles) there will be enough
parking available (493 spaces available) to accommodate the project parking demand.

Based on this analysis, adequate parking is provided within one block of the project to meet the
anticipated demand of the East Campus Sports Fields project. An adequate parking supply will be
available to meet the forecast parking demand during the Farmers' Market.


K.      CONCLUSIONS
Based on the results of this traffic impact analysis, the proposed redevelopment of the East Campus
Sports Fields can be implemented without significantly impacting the existing, opening year (2011),
and year 2035 surrounding circulation system. Evaluation of intersection LOS shows that the addition
of the project traffic to the baseline traffic volumes will not impact any study area intersections,
according to the City's significance criteria. As a result, no circulation improvements are
recommended. An adequate parking supply will be available to meet the forecast parking demand for
the proposed project.

As noted in the existing conditions section, sidewalks are provided along all streets in the vicinity of
the project. Bicycle access is provided via the Milvia Street bicycle boulevard and the Class 2.5
bikeway along Parker Street. The project would not remove or modify sidewalks or bikeways except
along the portion of Derby Street, which is being realigned as part of the project. The project would
not affect the existing crosswalks along Martin Luther King, Jr. Way and Shattuck Avenue.

The existing field is used by Berkeley High School sports teams as a practice field. The proposed
improved fields would continue to be used as practice fields and would also serve as the home game
field for the Berkeley High School baseball team. Because the use of the site will not be appreciably
changed, significant increases in pedestrian and bicycle traffic to the site are not expected.
Implementation of the proposed project would not result in changes to transit service to the site, and
the demand for transit service in the area is not expected to change significantly as a result of the
project.

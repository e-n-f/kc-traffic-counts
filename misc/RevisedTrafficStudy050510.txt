                                                                 LLG Reference: 3-10-1944

Subject:                   Talk-of-The-Town
                           City of Escondido

Dear Mr. Namdari:

LLG Engineers prepared a traffic study for the Talk-of-The-Town project in January
2008. This project proposes to construct an automatic Car Wash facility, a two-stall
oil change facility and a 4,156 square foot sit-down restaurant at the northwest corner
of Centre City Parkway and Brotherton Road in the City of Escondido. This letter
report updates an earlier one prepared on February 15, 2009 and addresses the
following three issues:

      ·      Potential conflict between project traffic and school vehicular traffic
      ·      Potential conflict between project traffic and school pedestrian traffic
      ·      Potential impact to nearby residential streets which the project traffic may
             utilize.

Figure 1 depicts the project location and study area.

1.0 TRAFFIC COUNTS
A traffic study was completed in December 2008 for this project. The analysis
contained in that study was based on counts conducted in June 2008, when schools
were closed for the summer. New traffic counts were conducted in the first week of
February 2010, with nearby schools and day-cares in session. These counts also
account for the traffic related to the Miller Elementary School, the Kindercare
Learning Center on South Center City Parkway, the YMCA daycare on Miller
Avenue and Leslie's daycare on Danica Place in the project vicinity. The count
sheets are included in an attachment to this letter.

When the counts were being conducted, southbound Centre City Parkway was closed
at Citracado Parkway, thus access to southbound I-15 was not possible. Traffic was
detoured to southbound I-15 via Citracado Parkway. No signs were provided on
Centre City Parkway north of Felicita Avenue and hence traffic was not detoured
onto Felicita Avenue. Therefore, traffic flow was not impacted due to the detour.

Therefore, fresh counts were conducted the week of March 15th 2010 on the 16th, 17th
and the 18th. The Southbound 1-15 / Centre City Parkway On-Ramp was closed on
Tuesday (16th) and open on Wednesday (17th) & Thursday (18th). The difference in
the daily volumes on Brotherton Road between with the on-ramp "closed" versus
"open" scenarios are within 5% and hence the ramp closure does not have a
significant impact on the travel patterns on Brotherton Road. Some of the variations
could be normal daily variations.

1.1          PEAK HOUR INTERSECTION TURNING MOVEMENT VOLUMES
Intersection turning movement counts were conducted during the following three
peak periods in order to capture the traffic activity during those peak hours in this
residential neighborhood. Figure 2 depicts the Year 2010 traffic counts. Table 1
depicts a comparison of the traffic volume counts conducted in June 2008 (summer) and
the current year 2010 counts (with schools in session).

      ·      AM peak hour - 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM
      ·      School PM peak hour - 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM
      ·      PM peak hour - 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM
Counts were conducted at the following intersections on Brotherton Road:

      ·      Brotherton Road / Felicita Road
      ·      Brotherton Road / Miller Avenue
      ·      Brotherton Road / Centre City Parkway
      ·      Brotherton Road / Escondido Boulevard

The total traffic volume entering the intersection during the AM and PM peak hours are
compared in Table 1. The total entering peak hour volumes have increased at some
intersections and increased at others.

1.2          SEGMENT VOLUMES
72-hour machine traffic counts (ADT) were conducted at the following segments with
schools in session.

                           ·      Brotherton Road from Felicita Road to Miller Avenue
                           ·      Brotherton Road from Miller Avenue to Centre City Parkway

As seen in Table 1, the segment volume on Brotherton Road west of Centre City
Parkway has decreased since the summer of June 2008, even though the counts were
currently conducted with area schools in session. The segment volumes were conducted
for a period of three days and remain consistent over the three-day period. A decrease of
28% is recorded on the segment of Brotherton Road between the June 2006 and March
2010 counts.

2.1          PEAK HOUR OPERATIONS
Figure 3 depicts the Existing + Project + Cumulative projects AM and PM peak hour
intersection turning movement volumes and the 24-hour segment volumes.
Attachment B contains the Existing peak hour intersection analysis worksheets.

2.1.1        EXISTING INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
Table 2 summarizes the peak hour intersection operations along Brotherton Road. As
seen in Table 2, all intersections are calculated to operate at LOS C or better during
all three peak periods. The analysis of the School PM peak (2:15 PM to 3:15 PM) is
included for comparison purposes only.

2.1.2        EXISTING + PROJECT + CUMULATIVE PROJECTS INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
Table 2 summarizes the peak hour intersection operations along Brotherton Road. As
seen in Table 2, with the addition of project and other cumulative projects, these
intersections are calculated to continue to operate at LOS C or better.

The intersection operations (delay and LOS) are comparable to the operations
calculated in the June 2008 report. In some cases, the delay has increased by a couple
of seconds. Hence, the conclusions in the June 2008 report remain valid.

2.2          SEGMENT OPERATIONS
Table 3 summarizes the segment operations along Brotherton Road. As seen in Table
3, with the addition of project and other cumulative projects, these segments are
calculated to continue to operate at LOS C or better. Therefore, the project traffic has
no impact on the subject segments.

3.0 PROJECT TRAFFIC USING NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS TO
    ACCESS NORTHBOUND CENTRE CITY PARKWAY
Eastbound left-turns are not permitted at the Brotherton Road / Centre City Parkway
intersection. Therefore, project traffic oriented to the north of the project site is not able
to return directly to northbound Centre City Parkway. There are several alternative
routes available. The neighborhood residents are concerned that traffic could potentially
use neighborhood streets to travel north. The most obvious route to the north is to make
an eastbound right-turn at the Brotherton Road / Centre City Parkway intersection,
proceed south on Centre City Parkway to Citracado Boulevard and make a protected U-
turn at the traffic signal at Citracado Parkway and then travel north towards Felicita
Avenue.

4.1          PROJECT TRIP GENERATION
Table 4 summarizes the estimated project traffic generation. As seen in Table 4, the
project is estimated to generate 1,579 daily trips with 95 trips during the AM peak hour
and 139 trips during the PM peak hour. It may be noted that the number of trips
identified above are primary trips, after accounting for passby traffic.

Based on the project trip distribution percentages assumed in the December 2008
report, 36% of the project traffic will potentially utilize Centre City Parkway to access
the project site. Therefore, the total amount of traffic that would need to access
northbound Centre City Parkway is estimated to be 296 vehicles over one 24-hour
period, with 17 during the AM peak hour and 24 during the PM peak hour. It may be
noted that only outbound traffic from the project would potentially utilize the
neighborhood streets to travel north of the site.

An additional 137 daily trips with 11 AM and 16 PM peak hour trips are estimated to
access northbound Escondido Boulevard. These trips that are destined to northbound
Escondido Boulevard are however not considered, since it would be more convenient
to use southbound Centre City Parkway to Citracado Parkway and then north on
Escondido Boulevard.

4.2          TRIP GENERATION FOR THE MOST INTENSE PERMITTED LAND USE
Table 4 also summarizes the estimated traffic generation assuming the most intense
permitted land use is constructed. The current permitted land uses at this site include a
fast-food restaurant. If the project consisted of a fast-foot restaurant, the project would
generate 3,360 daily trips with 168 trips during the AM peak hour and 176 trips during
the PM peak hour. It may be noted that the number of trips identified above are
primary trips, after accounting for passby traffic. Thus, potentially, the project could
have increased the neighborhood traffic by 605 daily trips with 30 AM and 32 PM peak
hour trips. However, the currently proposed land uses are estimated to generate much
fewer trips.

4.3          TRAVEL TIME ANALYSIS
A travel time analysis of two neighborhood routes and the route on Centre City
Parkway was conducted during the peak hours. Figure 4 depicts the three potential
routes. As seen in Figure 4, the travel time was recorded starting from the project site
and ending at the Felicita Avenue / Centre City Parkway intersection for all three
routes. Table 5 summarizes the results of this analysis. Three runs each were
conducted along each route during each of the three peak hours. Following are the
three routes:

Route 1: Charise Street / Darby Street / Montview Drive / U-turn on Centre City
         Parkway / Felicita Avenue
Route 2: C. City Parkway / U-Turn at Citracado Parkway / Felicita Avenue
Route 3: Charise Street / Darby Street / Montview Drive / Redwood Street / Felicita
         Avenue / Centre City Parkway

The travel time was recorded during the AM (7:15 AM to 8:15 AM), the school PM
peak (2:00 PM to 3:00 PM) and the traditional PM peak hours (4:30 PM to 5:30 PM).

      ·      Generally, few to no vehicular traffic were observed along the two
             neighborhood routes (Routes 1 & 3).
      ·      Only one pedestrian was encountered on the sidewalk on Charise Street
             during the entire exercise.
      ·      Route 1 - There are two STOP controlled intersections (Charise Street / Darby
             Street and Darby Street / Montview Drive) and one uncontrolled U-turn
             (Centre City Parkway / Escondido Parkway).
      ·      Route 2 ­ There is one STOP controlled intersection (Brotherton Road /
             Centre City Parkway) and one signalized U-turn (Centre City Parkway /
             Citracado Parkway.
      ·      Route 3 ­ There are 4 STOP controlled intersections (Charise Street / Darby
             Street and Montview Drive / Darby Street, Montview Drive / Redwood Street
             and Felicita Avenue / Redwood Street).
      ·      During the AM peak hour, the route with the shortest (average) travel time is
             Route 2.
      ·      During the School PM peak hour, the route with the shortest travel time is
             Route 1.
      ·      During the PM peak hour, the route with the shortest travel time is Route 2.
      ·      The difference in travel time between the routes is very small. However, if
             the overall travel speed is compared, the highest overall travel speed is on
             Route 2, even though it is the longest route. This is because the posted speed
             limit on Centre City Parkway is 45 mph, whereas the posted speed limit on the
             neighborhood streets is 25 mph. It may be noted that the speed accounts for
             the stopped time at Stop signs or for yielding to traffic along the route. It is
             not the actual speed on any specific roadway segment, which is higher.

Based on the above, it is concluded that though some people would use the
neighborhood streets, most people will use Route 2 to access northbound Centre City
Parkway from the site. The people that use the neighborhood streets are likely to be
people that live in the neighborhood or in adjacent neighborhoods. One has to be
familiar with the neighborhood to use the neighborhood streets. Going through the
neighborhood is not much shorter, nor is it faster or more convenient.

Assuming about 50% of the project traffic will use the neighborhood streets to travel
north, the traffic in the neighborhood will increase by 148 vehicles over an entire day,
or, 9 during the AM peak hour and 12 during the PM peak hour. Therefore, it is
concluded, that even though traffic on the neighborhood streets may increase due to

the project, the increase is minimal and will substantially change the traffic operations
in the neighborhood.

4.0 PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC
AM peak period and PM peak period pedestrian volume counts were conducted at the
following study area intersections and segments. The pedestrian counts were
conducted from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM to capture school and
adjacent street pedestrian traffic.

                           ·      Brotherton Road / Felicita Road
                           ·      Brotherton Road / Miller Avenue
                           ·      Brotherton Road segment from Felicita Road to Miller Avenue
                           ·      Brotherton Road segment from Miller Avenue to Centre City
                                  Parkway

Figure 2 the pedestrian volumes. Attachment A contains the pedestrian count sheets.

The pedestrian traffic counts were conducted during the AM and PM peak hours. The
highest pedestrian traffic was observed at the Brotherton Road / Miller Avenue
intersection during the school peak hour between 2:15 PM and 3:15 PM, as expected.
Table 6 summarizes the pedestrian counts along Brotherton Road during the three peak
hours. As seen in Table 6, the highest amount of pedestrian traffic is 86 pedestrians or
an average of a little more than one pedestrian every minute.

The project will possibly add a maximum of 17 and 24 trips during the AM and PM
peak hours assuming all traffic destined north will use neighborhood streets. However,
few to none of this traffic is expected to travel west on Brotherton Road.

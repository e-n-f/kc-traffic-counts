Executive Summary

Description of Traffic Study

BSC Group has evaluated traffic impacts associated with the construction of a 162,000
square foot office building, located on a property adjacent to the intersection of Spring
Street and Hayden Avenue in the Town of Lexington, Massachusetts. The proposed office
building would be part of the Ledgemont Corporate Center site and is intended to
complement existing buildings currently located on the property that house office space and
space devoted to research uses. This report includes an evaluation of the existing and
projected traffic conditions with and without the project. An outline of measures designed
to reduce the number of single occupancy vehicle trips to the site is presented as part of an
overall Transportation Demand Management strategy.

The study included intersections likely to be affected by the proposed development:

                     Marrett Road (Route 2A) at Spring Street and Bridge Street
                     Spring Street at Shade Street
                     Spring Street at Hayden Avenue/Patriot Way
                     Spring Street at Concord Avenue
                     Waltham Street at Hayden Avenue
                     Waltham Street at Route 2 WB Off-Ramp
                     Hayden Avenue at Route 2 WB Off-Ramp
                     Hayden Avenue at Route 2 WB On-Ramp


Summary of Results

    Based on Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation methodology, the
    proposed office development is expected to generate no more than 194 incremental
    trips (171 entering, 23 exiting) during the weekday morning peak and 191 incremental
    trips (33 entering, 158 exiting) during the weekday afternoon peak hour. On a daily
    basis, the proposed building is expected to generate no more than 1,277 incremental
    trips.

    In this report the number or trips to be generated by the proposed 162,000 square foot
    office building is based on a 170,000 square foot office building. This has resulted in
    higher projected trips then should be experienced (by a factor of approximately 5%).
    Also, based on recent vehicle counts taken at the site, the observed rates of the existing
    Ledgemont Corporate Center site are actually approximately 60 percent of the ITE
    standard rates. The use of the ITE standard methodology to project trip generation of
    the proposed building can therefore be considered to be very conservative (i.e.
    overestimating the number of trips and therefore overestimating the projected impacts
    on the local roadway network).

                                                           THREE LEDGEMONT Office building
                                                                 LEXINGTON, MAssachusetts
                                                                                   page ii




   Level of Service (LOS) is a measure of the ability of an intersection to accommodate
   the traffic demand that is placed upon it. The standardized measure of LOS ranges
   from "A" to "F", with "A" representing the best operating conditions and "F"
   representing the worst. Town By-Laws require that intersections affected by a
   proposed development operate at LOS D or better during peak hours. The LOS D
   rating can be achieved through the implementation of traffic engineering measures
   (e.g., striping, turn lanes, traffic signals) and/or other methods of positive traffic control
   (e.g., use of police officers).

   LOS analyses were conducted at intersections that are likely to be affected by the
   proposed office building under the existing and future traffic volumes with (Build) and
   without (No-Build) the construction of the proposed office building. The following
   summarizes the traffic capacity analyses results for each of the intersections:

           Under existing traffic volume conditions, five intersections have movements
           that operate at LOS E or F during peak hours, inadequate capacity, as defined
           by the Town. They are:

                             Marrett Road (Route 2A) at Spring Street/Bridge Street
                             Spring Street at Hayden Avenue/Patriot Way
                             Spring Street at Concord Avenue
                             Hayden Avenue at Route 2 WB Off-Ramp
                             Hayden Avenue at Waltham Street


           In the future, traffic signals and other improvements are expected to be
           implemented by the Town at the intersection of Marrett Road/Spring
           Street/Bridge Street, raising its operating condition to LOS D or better under
           No-Build and Build conditions, during the peak hours.

           Police control is expected to be implemented at the intersection of Spring
           Street at Hayden Avenue/Patriot Way, once the Lexington Technology Park
           development becomes increasingly occupied. This measure is expected to raise
           the operations at this intersection to LOS D or better during the peak hours.

                                                              LEXINGTON, MAssachusetts
                                                                                page iii




           Given the aforementioned improvements at the two locations, three
           intersections will have movements that do not operate at adequate capacity
           during the peak hours under No-Build and Build traffic volume conditions:

                           Spring Street at Concord Avenue
                           Hayden Avenue at Route 2 WB Off-Ramp
                           Hayden Avenue at Waltham Street

           As part of their local permit approval processes, many prior development
           projects in South Lexington had agreed to provide traffic impact mitigation in
           various forms, including physical improvements to the local roadways and
           absorbing the cost of providing traffic control implemented by police officers.
           Police officer traffic control is one of the commitments that had been made by
           others, at the three intersections with inadequate capacity under No-Build and
           Build conditions. If police control at these three intersections were
           implemented at these intersections during the peak periods, the intersections
           are expected to operate at LOS D or better.

   In order to enhance future traffic operations, the project proponent, upon receipt of a
   building permit, will make a financial contribution to the Town to fund off-site priority
   transportation improvements in South Lexington that benefit the project. These priority
   projects will be identified in conjunction with the Town. Additionally, 95 Hayden,
   LLC will assist the Town in obtaining grant financing for infrastructure improvements
   in South Lexington.

   In order to promote the use of alternate modes of transportation and reduce the number
   of single occupancy vehicles, the proponent has committed to implement a
   Transportation Demand Management Plan for the proposed facility based on the
   guidelines provided by the Town of Lexington's "Transportation Demand Management
   Policy". The comprehensive plan will involve proactive measures such as enrollment
   in and sponsorship of an existing regional transportation management association, the
   128 Business Council, designation of a site transportation coordinator for the property,
   encouragement of employees to use alternative forms of transportation including the
   MBTA, the Town's LEXPRESS bus services (with bus stop locations on or near the
   project site), and shuttle service to Alewife Station, as well as encouraging tenants to
   subsidize employees cost of the use of transit. Measures to encourage the use
   vanpooling, bicycles and alternative-fuel vehicles is also part of the plan. The plan will
   be implemented upon occupancy of the proposed building.

This study indicates that the area roadways and intersections can accommodate the
construction of the office building at the Ledgemont Corporate Center site. Proposed
transportation demand management measures are expected to reduce the use of single
occupant vehicles associated with the site.

1.0 Introduction

BSC Group, Inc. (BSC) has prepared this Traffic Impact Study to evaluate
the potential impacts on the local transportation network associated with the
construction of a 162,000 SF (gross floor area) office building, to be known
as Three Ledgemont, located on a property adjacent to the intersection of
Spring Street and Hayden Avenue in the Town of Lexington, Massachusetts.
 The proposed office building would be part of the Ledgemont Corporate
Center site and is intended to complement existing buildings currently
located on the property that house office space and space devoted to research
uses. The site can currently be accessed via two driveways: one along
Hayden Avenue and one along Spring Street. Under the current proposal,
there are no changes planned to either of the existing driveways at their
intersections with the public way, nor are there any new access points being
proposed.

This study includes a review of existing traffic and roadway conditions in the
vicinity of the project site, as well as a review of the accident history at study
area intersections. This report identifies background traffic growth for study
area roadways, estimates additional traffic generated by the proposed
building and evaluates traffic impacts due to project-generated traffic. This
study is based on a building with a gross floor area of 170,000 square feet,
which is slightly larger than the proposed building and therefore
overestimates the number of trips by approximately five percent. Mitigation
actions are described that address potential impacts to the adjacent roadway
system, as well as actions that will encourage the reduction of single
occupancy vehicles traveling to and from the site.

2.0 Existing Transportation Conditions

2.1   Project Background

95 Hayden, LLC (95 Hayden) proposes to expand the Ledgemont Corporate
Center site through the construction of a 162,000 SF office building. The
Ledgemont Corporate Center property is located northeast of and adjacent to
the intersection of Hayden Avenue and Spring Street. Access to the project
site is currently provided at two locations: a two-way driveway intersecting
Spring Street and a two-way driveway intersecting Hayden Avenue. Under
the proposed project, no new access/egress locations have been proposed
and, the aforementioned access points to the site will be retained.

Additionally, 416 new parking spaces are also to be constructed, the vast
majority will be garaged within the building.

2.2   Existing Roadway Conditions

A comprehensive field inventory of the adjacent roadway system was
conducted during June of 2008. The inventory included collection of
existing roadway geometry, traffic control, and traffic volumes for the
roadways and intersections in the vicinity of the site. The locus of the
project site is displayed in Figure 1.

Waltham Street

Waltham Street is a north-south collector road that connects Lexington
Center and Route 2A in the north with Route 2, Concord Avenue, and the
City of Waltham in the south. Waltham Street is of varying widths. A
bituminous concrete sidewalk is present along the east side of Waltham
Street in the area that concerns this project. Land use in the vicinity of
Hayden Avenue is primarily residential.

Hayden Avenue

Hayden Avenue is a 46-foot wide road running in an east-west direction that
fronts Route 2 between Spring Street and Waltham Street, providing one lane
in each travel direction. The Hayden Avenue layout varies as it abuts the
project site but is approximately 70 feet wide as it approaches Spring Street.
This road serves a number of research & development sites and office
buildings. One of the Ledgemont Site Drives is located on the north side of
Hayden Avenue.

                                                                   PAGE 3




There is no posted speed limit on Hayden Avenue, therefore the statutory
speed limit of 30 MPH will prevail. There are no sidewalks present along the
length of Hayden Avenue. Portions of Hayden Avenue are under the
jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD).

Spring Street

Spring Street is a collector road running in a north-south direction. In the
vicinity of the project site, Spring Street is a two-way, two lane roadway of
varying widths. North of Hayden Avenue to its intersection with Marrett
Road, sections of Spring Street measure 26 feet, while south of this location
(over Route 2), the curb-to-curb width is approximately 40 feet. The Spring
Street layout varies as it abuts the project site but is approximately 60 feet
wide as it approaches Route 2. At its intersection with Hayden Avenue and
with Concord Avenue, turning lanes are also provided. North of Hayden
Avenue and beyond the site drive, the land use along Spring Street
transitions into primarily residential, while south of the site, Spring Street
serves a mixture of office, R&D, and other commercial use. One of the two
Ledgemont site drives is located along Spring Street, just north of Hayden
Avenue. The posted speed limit in both directions is 30 MPH. There is a
bituminous concrete sidewalk on the west side of Spring Street that fronts a
portion of the Lexington Technology Park site and continues south of
Concord Avenue. The sidewalk is in usable condition.

Marrett Road (Route 2A)

Marrett Road (Route 2A) is a 32 feet wide road running in the east-west
direction, and connects Route 128 with Massachusetts Avenue. Marrett
Road provides one travel lane in each direction, and serves a mix of
residential housing and commercial developments. There is a sidewalk along
the north side of Marrett Road, and a sidewalk along the south side to the
west of Spring Street.

2.3      Study Area Intersections

Intersections in close proximity to the project site are expected to be
impacted to various degrees by the proposed expansion on the project site.
These study area intersections have been identified and are as follows:

          Marrett Road (Route 2A) at Spring Street and Bridge Street
          Spring Street at Shade Street
          Spring Street at Hayden Avenue/Patriot Way
          Spring Street at Concord Avenue
          Waltham Street at Hayden Avenue
          Waltham Street at Route 2 WB Off-Ramp
          Hayden Avenue at Route 2 WB Off-Ramp
          Hayden Avenue at Route 2 WB On-Ramp

Additionally, traffic operations at the location of the existing site driveways,
located along Spring Street and Hayden Avenue, have been examined.
Existing traffic control and intersection geometry for the aforementioned
intersections are summarized below.

Marrett Road (Route 2A)/Spring Street/Bridge Street

Spring Street and Bridge Street meet Marrett Road (Route 2A) at a STOP-
controlled intersection. Movements from Bridge Street and Spring Street are
under STOP-control, while movements on Marrett Road are free-flowing.
One 13-foot shared through and right-turn lane is provided on the eastbound
Marrett Road approach. A single shared left-turn and through lane is
provided on the westbound approach to this intersection.

One 13-foot shared lane is provided on the northbound Spring Street
approach. Bridge Street is a one-way street, with 26 feet provided on the
northwestbound approach to the intersection.

Spring Street/Shade Street

Shade Street intersects Spring Street to form an unsignalized T-intersection.
Movements from Shade Street to Spring Street are under STOP-control. One
shared left and right turn lane is provided on the eastbound Shade Street
approach to the intersection. Single 14-foot northbound and southbound
lanes are provided on the Spring Street approaches to the intersection.

Spring Street at Hayden Avenue/Patriot Way

Spring Street and Hayden Avenue intersect to form a two-way STOP-
controlled intersection, with eastbound and westbound traffic under STOP
control.

The northbound and southbound Spring Street approaches both consist of
two lanes: one shared through and right turn lane and an exclusive left turn
lane. The southbound left-turn lane provides approximately 200 feet of
vehicle storage, while the northbound left-turn lane measures approximately
275 feet.

The westbound Hayden Avenue approach to this intersection consists of a
channelized right turn, an exclusive left turn lane and a through lane. The
exclusive left turn lane storage measures 165 feet in length while the
channelized right turn lane is 120 feet in length. A private eastbound
driveway (Patriot Way) also intersects Spring Street at this location. This
eastbound approach consists of one shared through and right turn lane and an
exclusive left turn lane.

At this intersection, a concrete traffic island had been constructed to
accommodate police control. A spotlight has also been installed to increase
visibility. Police details had been funded by the Raytheon Corporation to
control traffic at this location during the morning and the afternoon peak
hours. However, the Raytheon Corporation has since relocated and police
details will not control traffic at this location until the property becomes
more fully occupied.

Concord Avenue/Spring Street

Concord Avenue meets Spring Street to form a T-intersection. Traffic
movements from Concord Avenue onto Spring Street are under STOP-
control.

The northbound Spring Street approach consists of a single 16-foot shared
through and right turn lane. The southbound approach consists of an
exclusive left-turn lane and a through travel lane. Pavement markings
provide 100 feet of storage for left-turning vehicles, although the width of
the southbound side of this roadway is such that two lanes of traffic can be
provided for a length far greater than marked on the roadway.

Left and right-turn lanes are provided on the westbound Concord Avenue
approach to this intersection. Through the use of pavement markings,
approximately 200 feet of left-turn vehicle storage is provided, although the

width of the westbound side of this roadway is such that two lanes of traffic
can be provided for a length greater than marked on the roadway. A concrete
traffic island had recently been constructed to accommodate police control.
A spotlight has also been installed to increase visibility.

Hayden Avenue/Waltham Street

Hayden Avenue intersects Waltham Street to form a T-intersection, with
eastbound Hayden Avenue traffic under STOP-control.

The northbound Waltham Street approach consists of a left-turn lane and a
22-foot through lane. The latter lane is wide enough for two through lanes to
be accommodated when traffic demand necessitates. The southbound
Waltham Street approach lane measures approximately 29 feet. The width of
this unmarked approach is such that a shared right-turn and through lane and
a through lane can be accommodated. A raised median island separates
northbound and southbound traffic flows at this intersection. This concrete
traffic island, recently constructed, has a spotlight to accommodate police
control.

The eastbound Hayden Avenue approach consists of a shared through and
left-turn lane and an exclusive right-turn lane. Right-turning traffic is
channelized and under YIELD-control.

Waltham Street/State Route 2 Westbound Off-Ramp

Within 200 feet south of the intersection of Hayden Avenue/Waltham Street,
the Route 2 westbound off ramp intersects Waltham Street. The westbound
single lane off-ramp is under STOP-control at its intersection with Waltham
Street. Since Waltham Street is a median divided roadway at this location,
vehicles can only make a right turn off the ramp on to Waltham Street.

Hayden Avenue/State Route 2 Westbound Off-Ramp

The Route 2 Westbound Off-Ramp intersects Hayden Avenue to form a T-
intersection. While not formally striped, the off-ramp is wide enough two
lanes of traffic to be accommodated. The eastbound and westbound
approaches to this intersection each consist of one lane of traffic. These
lanes are at least 18 feet in width. East of the ramp, a raised median island
separates traffic flows on Hayden Avenue.

Right turns from the off-ramp onto Hayden Avenue are channelized and are
under YIELD-control, while left turns from the ramp on to Hayden Avenue
are under STOP-control.

Hayden Avenue/State Route 2 Westbound On-Ramp

Hayden Avenue intersects the Route 2 Westbound On-Ramp to form a T-
intersection. Both the eastbound and westbound approaches are comprised
of a single lane. The eastbound approach has a channelized right turn and
has a lane width of at least 20 feet. This lane is wide enough to
accommodate both through traffic and right turning vehicles. The Hayden
Avenue westbound approach has a minimum lane width of 19.5 feet. The
width of this westbound lane is such that it may act as a left turning lane and
a through lane when the traffic demand necessitates.

Site Driveways

The site can currently be accessed via two driveways: one along Hayden
Avenue and one along Spring Street. Under the current proposal, there are
no changes planned to either of the existing driveways at their intersections
with the public way, nor are there any new access points being proposed.

The Hayden Avenue driveway is located approximately 700 feet to the east
of the intersection of Spring Street and Hayden Avenue. This two lane two-
way site driveway is aligned with the driveway to 92-100 Hayden Avenue
and is under STOP control. The Hayden Avenue driveway carries the
majority of the traffic that enters and exits the site.

The Spring Street driveway is located approximately 900 feet to the north of
the intersection of Spring Street and Hayden Avenue. This driveway is also
located between two of driveways to the Lexington Technology Park
development across Spring Street (125 Spring Street). This site drive is
located approximately 300 feet to the north of one of the driveways to 125
Spring Street development and approximately 200 feet to the south of the
second driveway to 125 Spring Street.


2.4   Existing Traffic Volumes

Existing daily two-way traffic volumes on roadways in the vicinity of the
project site were obtained through the placement of automatic traffic
recorders (ATR). The ATR counts were conducted over a 24 to 48-hour
period in June of 2008. Volumes were recorded on Spring Street (north of
the Ledgemont site drive) and on Hayden Avenue (east of the Ledgemont
site drive). A summary of these daily and peak traffic period volumes is
presented in Table 1.

Based on the data obtained from the traffic volume counts, the average
weekday two-way volume on Spring Street is approximately 8,200 vehicles
                                                                                               TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY
                                                                                          THREE LEDGEMONT office building
                                                                                                LEXINGTON, MAssachusetts
                                                                                                                 PAGE 9




                               per day (vpd). During the weekday morning peak hour, most vehicles on
                               Spring Street are traveling in the southbound direction. During the afternoon
                               peak hour, traffic flows are more balanced between the northbound (67
                               percent) and southbound directions on Spring Street. Peak hour traffic
                               demands are approximately 12 percent of daily volumes during each of the
                               peak hours.

                               The average weekday two-way volume on Hayden Avenue is approximately
                               6,000 vehicles per day (vpd). As can be seen from Table 1, during the
                               morning peak hour, traffic volumes are balanced between the eastbound and
                               westbound directions. During the afternoon peak hour, approximately two-
                               thirds of the traffic on Hayden Avenue is traveling in the eastbound
                               direction. Peak hour traffic demands are approximately 12 and 10 percent of
                               daily volumes during the morning and afternoon peak hours respectively.

                               In addition to the daily volume counts, weekday morning and afternoon peak
                               hour traffic volumes were collected at study area intersections and at the site
                               driveways to the Ledgemont Corporate Center. These turning movement
                               counts (TMCs) were conducted from 7:00 ­ 9:00 AM, and from 4:00 ­ 6:00
                               PM on Wednesday June 11, 2008. These hours represent the peak traffic
                               volume periods for roadways used by commuters.

                               Based on the results of these intersection counts, the overall peak hours of
                               traffic at the key intersections were determined to be 7:45 AM ­ 8:45 AM
                               during the morning peak period, and 5:00 PM ­ 6:00 PM during the
                               afternoon peak period. Existing morning and afternoon peak hour traffic
                               volumes for the study area intersections are displayed on Figures 2 and 3
                               respectively. Complete traffic count data are contained in Appendix A.

2.5     Transit Service

2.5.1    Public Transportation

The Ledgemont Corporate Center is serviced by a number of transit routes.
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) provides bus
service on Routes 76 and 62. Additionally, the Town of Lexington provides
supplemental bus service with its Lexington LEXPRESS service.
LEXPRESS bus service is jointly funded by the Town of Lexington and the
MBTA. LEXPRESS routes serve, among other locations, schools,
recreation facilities, businesses, medical facilities and libraries.

MBTA Route 76

MBTA Bus Route 76 travels between the Lincoln Laboratories in Lexington
and Alewife Station in Cambridge. During the morning peak periods, service
is provided in each direction, generally every thirty minutes. During the
afternoon peak period, service is also provided every half-hour. Bus stops in

2.5.2    The Alewife Shuttle

The Alewife Shuttle is a privately funded service operated by the 128
Business Council. The shuttle travels between the Alewife Red Line MBTA
station and a number of the office parks in the Route 2/Route 128 corridor,
including the Ledgemont site. From 6:40 AM to 9:10 AM, the shuttle bus
departs six times from Alewife Station for the Ledgemont site (among a
number of other locations), with headways of 20 to 35 minutes. From 4:00
PM to 6:15 PM, the shuttle arrives on site three times for rides to Alewife,
with headways of approximately one hour. One additional shuttle ride to
Alewife Station at 7:15 PM is also available. The service fare is $2.25 for
employees of participating member companies (with ID card). Fares for all
others is $4.00.

2.6     Accident Data

Crash data for the Town of Lexington were obtained from the Massachusetts
Highway Department for the most recent three years on record (2004 ­
2006).

Crash rates were calculated for all study area intersections. The rates
represent the number of accidents per million vehicles entering the
intersection. The Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD) has
determined the average crash rate for the year 2005 in District 4 (which
includes the Town of Lexington) to be 0.88 for signalized intersections, and
0.63 for unsignalized intersections. These rates represent `average' accident
experience and serve as a basis for comparing reported crash rates for study
area intersections. Crash rates that grossly exceed Massachusetts Highway
Department averages warrant closer evaluation to identify potential safety-
related improvements.

As can be seen on Table 2, the intersection of Marrett Road (Route 2A) at
Spring Street and Bridge Street, the intersection of Spring Street at Concord
Avenue, the intersection of Waltham Street at the Route 2 westbound off-
ramps and the intersection of Spring Street at Shade Street all exhibited crash
rates below the MHD district average.

Three intersections, Spring Street at Hayden Avenue, Waltham Street at
Hayden Avenue and Waltham Street at the Route 2 westbound off-ramp
exhibited crash rates above the MHD district average. The majority of the
accidents were "rear-end" type, which is not unexpected at STOP-controlled
intersections. The vast majority of the accidents also occurred during the
daytime hours under dry road conditions. The majority of accidents also
appeared to occur during the morning and afternoon peak commuter periods.

Classifications of accidents are summarized in Table 2. Crash rate
worksheets are contained in Appendix B.

distance. Sight distance was recorded in conformance with accepted
standards established by the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO). Available sight distance, as recorded in
the field, has been compared to minimum requirements, as established by
AASHTO. Sight distance is a function of the perception/reaction time of an
approaching motorist and the required braking distance, which is a function
of vehicular speed. Stopping sight distance is the length of roadway ahead
that is visible to the driver. Available sight distance should be sufficient to
allow a vehicle traveling at the design speed to stop before reaching a
stationary object in its path.

Sight distances on Spring Street will be based on an 85th percentile speed of
37 MPH, recorded in both the northbound and southbound directions. Speed
data were collected using ATR data collection tubes placed on the roadway
(June 11th & 12th 2008). The posted speed limit on Spring Street is 30 MPH.

Required sight distances on Hayden Avenue will be based on 85th percentile
speeds of 44 MPH and 49 MPH, which were recorded in the eastbound and
westbound directions, respectively. Speed data were collected using ATR
data collection tubes placed on the roadway (June 11th 2008). There is no
posted speed limit on Hayden Avenue, thus the statutory speed limit on
Hayden Avenue is 30 MPH. Measured sight distances and the minimum
required distances are displayed in Table 3.

3.0 Future Traffic Volumes

Future traffic conditions within the study area were forecast to gain an
understanding of the traffic impacts of the project on the adjacent
transportation network. Traffic growth within the study area is a function of
expected land development, economic activity, changes in demographics and
changes in travel patterns.

Two future alternatives were analyzed to determine future traffic conditions
under a five-year planning time horizon. The selected planning horizon is
consistent with published state guidelines for traffic impact assessments1.
The first alternative, the Future No-Build Condition, examines vehicular
traffic conditions five years into the future (in 2013), assuming the proposed
expansion on the site does not occur. The second alternative, the Future
Build Condition, examines the impact that the proposed 170,000 SF
expansion will have on traffic operations within the study area.

3.1     Future No-Build Conditions

In order to evaluate traffic impacts associated with the proposed
redevelopment, future No-Build Condition traffic volumes were examined to
provide a baseline condition for comparison. No-Build Condition vehicular
traffic volumes are those that are expected to use the roadway network in the
future, assuming the proposed expansion of the Ledgemont Corporate Center
does not occur. Accepted practice calls for the evaluation of traffic
conditions five years into the future, thus No-Build Condition traffic volumes
will be projected for the year 2013, based on traffic volumes collected in
2008.

Future No-Build Condition traffic volume projections generally consist of
general background growth, and traffic generated from specifically proposed
developments in the study area. Typically, general background growth is a
function of future land development, increased economic activity, and
changes in travel patterns.

3.1.1    General Background Growth

The Town of Lexington Planning Department was consulted in order to
determine an appropriate annual rate of growth for traffic volumes in the
vicinity of the project. The Department indicated that the growth of the town
has been negligible this decade. Nonetheless, in order to present a
conservative analysis of future traffic, a one percent annual rate of growth of
traffic volumes was used to account for all background growth that will
occur over the next five years, including external growth and growth due to
unspecified developments in the area.

3.1.2    Specific Planned Developments

Projected future no-build traffic volumes for 2013 include all specifically
proposed developments affecting the study area, as advised by the Town of
Lexington. It is assumed that the one percent annual background growth rate
employed will capture developments that have yet to be identified.

As shown in Table 4, there are two specific development projects within the
study area that should be considered: The redevelopment and expansion of
the former headquarters of the Raytheon Company into office and research
and development space (Lexington Technology Park) and The Avalon Bay
project, which consists of new residential units along Concord Avenue. The
Lexington Technology Park site was partially occupied at the writing of this
study (130,150 SF occupied).

Additionally, the existing Ledgemont Corporate Center buildings currently
exhibit a vacancy rate of approximately 40%. To properly account for the
potential of the full occupancy of the existing buildings on the Ledgemont
site, the No-Build volumes scenario will reflect the assumption that the
existing buildings will achieve 100% occupancy in the future.

The resulting year 2013 Future No-Build peak hour traffic volumes were
developed through the application of the one percent annual growth rate for a
five year period, the addition of traffic associated with other development
projects and the addition of traffic associated with the full occupancy of the
existing Ledgemont buildings. Figures 4 and 5 display the year 2013 Future
No-Build traffic volumes for the morning and afternoon peak hours
respectively.

3.2     Build Conditions

In order to evaluate the effect of the project on traffic in the study area, trips
associated with the proposed building are projected, distributed and assigned
to the adjacent roadway network. These incremental vehicle-trips are added
to No-Build Condition traffic volumes to form the Build Condition traffic
volume networks for the morning and afternoon commuter peak hours.

3.2.1     Project Generated Traffic

Project-generated trips will be calculated using the Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) methodology. Based upon existing traffic volume counts
conducted at both Ledgemont site driveways, existing trip generation data is
also presented.

3.2.1.1    ITE Trip Generation

To estimate the trip generation characteristics of the proposed facility, the
Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation (7th ed. 2003) manual
was employed. The ITE Trip Generation data is widely used by traffic
engineers for this application. The manual provides vehicle-trip generation
projections for a number of land uses. The data contained in Trip Generation
have been obtained from the research and experiences of transportation
engineering and planning professionals and is based on over 3,700 trip
generation studies submitted by public agencies, developers, consulting firms
and associations.

As previously stated, a 162,000 SF office building has been proposed.
However, project generated trips, future expected volumes and intersection
capacity analysis are based on a larger building size of 170,000 SF.
Therefore, the results presented in this report will be conservative (i.e. the
analysis overestimates the number of trips by approximately five percent).

Trips generated by the proposed office building can be estimated through the
use of trip generation data for ITE Land Use Code 710 ­ General Office
Building, the most appropriate category for the expansion of existing office
space. Table 5 summarizes the incremental trips generated by the proposed
development.

                                Based on the results of this analysis, an additional 170,000 SF office building
                                is projected to add generate 194 trips (171 entering, 23 exiting) during the
                                morning peak hour and 191 trips (33 entering, 158 exiting) during the
                                afternoon peak hour. On a daily basis, the proposed building is expected to
                                generate approximately 1,277 trips. Trip generation calculations are
                                contained in Appendix C.

                                3.2.1.2      Existing Trips

                                Distribution of Existing Trips

                                Because the site is currently occupied by office space and by space devoted
                                to research and development (R&D), the vast majority of trips generated
                                during the morning peak hour are employees beginning the workday,
                                entering the site. Similarly, the vast majority of trips generated during the
                                evening peak are employees leaving the site. Thus trips entering the site
                                during the morning peak hour and trips exiting the site during the afternoon
                                peak hour can be considered representative of the characteristics of entering
                                and exiting traffic during the peak periods.

                                Based upon traffic volume counts conducted at the site driveways along
                                Spring Street and along Hayden Avenue, a total of 173 vehicles entered the
                                site during the morning peak hour. Thirty-five percent of these trips entered
                                via the Spring Street drive (20 percent from the north and 15 percent from
                                the south), while 65 percent entered the site using the Hayden Avenue drive
                                (25 percent from the west and 40 percent from the east).

                                During the evening peak hour, a total of 196 vehicles exited the site.
                                Twenty-four percent of these trips exited via the Spring Street driveway (16
                                percent to the north and 8 percent to the south) while 76 percent of the trips
                                exited via the Hayden Avenue driveway (8 percent to the west and 68 percent
                                to the east).

Based upon existing traffic volumes observed entering and exiting the site
during the peak periods, trip generation rates for the existing facilities on the
project site can be estimated. A total of 177 trips were observed entering and
exiting the site during the morning peak hour, while 204 trips were observed
entering and exiting the site during the afternoon peak hour. The current
occupancy rate of the existing buildings is approximately 60%. The trip
generation rates of the existing facilities are therefore estimated as:

        AM Peak - 0.74 Trips per 1000 Gross Square Feet
        PM Peak ­ 0.85 Trips per 1000 Gross Square Feet

In contrast, ITE offers the following rates for General Office Buildings (Land
Use Code 710):

        AM Peak ­ 1.55 Trips per 1000 Gross Square Feet
        PM Peak ­ 1.49 Trips per 1000 Gross Square Feet

Additionally, ITE offers the following rates for Research and Development
Centers (Land Use Code 760):

        AM Peak ­ 1.24 Trips per 1000 Gross Square Feet
        PM Peak ­ 1.08 Trips per 1000 Gross Square Feet

The existing development is of mixed use, with an estimated 75 percent of
the space devoted to office uses and the remainder to R&D activities. The
weighted average of the ITE rates cited above can be calculated to provide a
basis for comparison with observed rates. The weighted average ITE rates
are as follows:

        AM Peak ­ 1.47 Trips per 1000 Gross Square Feet
        PM Peak ­ 1.39 Trips per 1000 Gross Square Feet

The observed rates are between 50 and 60 percent of the ITE rates.
Therefore, the use of the ITE methodology to project trip generation of the
proposed building can therefore be considered to be conservative (i.e. the
rates used for the analyses contained in this report are higher than the
existing rates).

3.2.2   Trip Distribution and Assignment

Trip generation results quantify additional trips associated with a proposed
development. In order to assess the impacts related to these additional traffic
volumes, trips must be distributed on to the local roadway network.

The trips generated to and from the site were assigned to the roadway
network based on travel patterns observed for existing Ledgemont Corporate
Center traffic. These patterns were determined using peak hour counts
conducted at study area intersections and project driveways. In projecting
the travel patterns, traffic volume data was supplemented by historical
residency data of Ledgemont Corporate Center employees. The proposed
building is expected to draw employees from a similar geographic
distribution. Expected travel patters also account for the proposed location
of the building and garage entrance within the site and accounts for the
configuration of site roadways.

Trip distribution patterns are illustrated on Figure 6. Incremental traffic
volumes expected to be generated by the expansion have been distributed
according to the traffic patterns developed in this report and are presented in
Figure 7. Year 2013 Build Condition traffic volumes, which consist of the
addition of project generated traffic to No-Build traffic volumes, are

3.2.3   Parking

The proposed expansion includes 416 new parking spaces, the vast majority
of these will be garaged within the building. Observations on the existing
Ledgemont site, taken within the past 12 months, indicate that the peak
parking demand occurs by 10am. Accounting for leasable space vacancy
rates, parking demand is currently approximately 80%. However, this does
not take in to account the lower than average employee densities associated
with the research laboratory uses that are currently prevalent on the site.
Achieving average employee densities related to predominantly general
office uses, as it is and would be zoned, would have the effect of further
increasing the demand for existing spaces to approximately 90%-95%. It is
anticipated that the demand and time of peak demand of the proposed spaces
will follow existing observed patterns and expected demand rates for parking
associated with office space.

4.0 Traffic Impact Analysis

4.1     Capacity Analysis

Measuring existing traffic volumes and projecting future traffic volumes
quantifies traffic flow within a study area. To assess quality of flow,
capacity analyses were conducted for the study area intersections for the
Existing, Future No-Build, and Future Build Conditions. The capacity
analyses provide a standardized indication of the ability of the intersections
to accommodate traffic demands placed upon them.

4.1.1    Levels of Service Criteria

A primary result of capacity analyses is the assignment of Level of Service
(LOS) to traffic facilities under various traffic flow conditions. Analyses
were conducted using methods defined in the Highway Capacity Manual
2000 (TRB, 2000) for signalized and unsignalized intersections. The Level
of Service is conceptually defined as a qualitative measure describing
operational conditions within a traffic stream and their perception by
motorists.

A Level of Service definition generally describes these conditions in terms of
such factors as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic
interruptions, comfort and convenience, and safety. In so doing, Level of
Service provides an index to quality of traffic flow.

Six Levels of Service are defined for each type of facility. They are given
letter designations, from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating
conditions and LOS F representing the worst. Since the Level of Service of a
traffic facility is a function of traffic flows placed upon it, an intersection
may operate at a wide range of Levels of Service, depending on time of day,
day of week, or period of year.

The average delay per vehicle approaching an intersection is used to quantify
the Level of Service at a particular intersection. This is discussed briefly
below, and LOS designations are defined in Table 6. Average delay
measures the mean stopped delay experienced by vehicles entering an
intersection during the design period. Average delay is measured for each
individual turning movement that must yield the right of way, and for the
intersection as a whole (including through vehicles that experience no delay).

4.2     Improvements by Others

4.2.1    Marrett Road (Route 2A) at Spring Street/Bridge Street

In 2008, the Town of Lexington applied for state grant funding of
improvements at the intersection of Marrett Road (Route 2A) and Spring
Street. The Town has evaluated various options for improving conditions at
the intersection. The preferred option, which was developed in conjunction
with stakeholders, included the installation of a traffic signal, the addition of
an exclusive left turn lane on the Marrett Road westbound approach and
pedestrian infrastructure improvements. It is expected that these
improvements will be in place within the five year time horizon of this report
and thus the future year (2013) capacity analyses reflect the installation of a
traffic signal at this intersection.

4.2.2    Spring Street at Hayden Avenue/Patriot Way

As part of the mitigation commitments made by the Lexington Technology
Park redevelopment project, the project will provide for police officers to
control movements at the intersection of Spring Street at Hayden
Avenue/Patriot Way during peak hours. Police officers will be assigned to
control the intersection when it is determined that the traffic volumes are
such that the Peak Hour traffic signal warrant, as defined by the Manual on

Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), is satisfied. For the purposes of
the capacity analyses presented in this report, it is assumed that the warrant
will be satisfied and that police officers will control movements at the
intersection in the future year scenarios (2013).

4.3   Operating Conditions

The Synchro traffic analysis software package (Version 6) was employed to
evaluate operating conditions at study area intersections. This software uses
methodology based on the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), 2000 edition
to conduct the analyses and is widely accepted for use by a number of public
agencies.

Under the HCM, the overall LOS for a STOP controlled intersection is not
defined. However, LOS for individual minor movements (i.e. side street or
left turn) movements can be measured. It is important to note that the LOS
for individual minor movements is not the sole measure for evaluating the
overall performance of an unsignalized intersection. In this report, LOS of
the poorest operating minor movement is reported on Tables 7 and 9
(unsignalized intersections). Capacity analyses worksheets for each
intersection can be found in Appendix D.

Police controlled intersections have similar operating characteristics to
signalized intersections. Therefore, police controlled intersections are
typically analyzed as signalized intersections. Overall LOS for a signalized
intersection can be measured and is reported in Tables 8 and 10.

The results of the capacity analysis for the intersections under evaluation are
summarized below in Tables 7, 8, 9, and 10.

Section 12.3 of the Town Zoning requires that intersections likely to be
affected by a proposed development have adequate capacity. The Zoning
defines adequate capacity as Level of Service D or better. The results of the
capacity analysis indicate that under existing traffic volumes and intersection
control, five of the eight study area intersections currently have movements
operating at inadequate capacity, as defined in the Town Zoning. These are:

    Marrett Road (Route 2A) at Spring St./Bridge St. ­ LOS F (AM and PM)
    Spring St. at Hayden Avenue/Patriot Way ­ LOS F (AM) & LOS E (PM)
    Spring Street at Concord Avenue ­ LOS F (AM) & LOS E (PM)
    Hayden Avenue at Route 2 WB Off-Ramp ­ LOS F (AM)
    Hayden Avenue at Waltham Street ­ LOS F (AM) & LOS F (PM)

As previously stated, a traffic signal and other intersection improvements are
 expected to be installed at the intersection of Marrett Road and Spring
Street, funded by a state grant. Additionally, the intersection of Spring Street
at Hayden Avenue/Patriot Way is expected to be under police control under
future traffic volumes. These two measures are expected to improve
operations at the two intersections to LOS D or better, as indicated in Tables
8 and 10. Therefore, under No-Build conditions, without the construction of
the proposed Three Ledgemont building, the following intersections will
have movements with inadequate capacity, as defined by the Town By-Law:

    Spring Street at Concord Avenue ­ LOS F (AM) & LOS F (PM)
    Hayden Avenue at Route 2 WB Off-Ramp ­ LOS F (AM)
    Hayden Avenue at Waltham Street ­ LOS F (AM) & LOS F (PM)

5.0 Mitigation

Certain measures can be enacted to mitigate the effects of the increased
traffic volumes expected from the proposed Ledgemont expansion within the
planning time horizon (i.e. the next five years). Additionally, a
comprehensive Transportation Demand Management (TDM) plan to mitigate
the effects of the proposed expansion is outlined.

5.1   Previous Traffic Mitigation Commitments by Area Businesses

As part of their local permit approval processes, many prior development
projects in South Lexington had agreed to provide traffic impact mitigation
in various forms. The proponents of these various projects provided funds to
be used to make physical improvements to the local roadways and
intersections. The proponents of these development projects had agreed to
pay for the cost of providing traffic control implemented by Lexington police
officers at one or more intersections during the weekday morning and
afternoon peak periods. Other forms of mitigation included funding the
design of future traffic signals and agreeing to apply traffic demand
management techniques to reduce traffic volumes to and from their sites. For
a comprehensive listing of these prior commitments, please refer to Appendix
E.

                                The purpose of using police control was to mitigate the level-of-service "E"
                                and "F" operations that exist at certain unsignalized intersections, as required
                                by the Town's Zoning, without installing traffic signals to which the local
                                residents have historically objected. Five of the intersections analyzed in this
                                report presently have commitments from other commercial property owners
                                to provide police control (see Table 11). These include: Spring
                                Street/Hayden Avenue, Marrett Road/Spring Street/Bridge Street, Spring
                                Street/Concord Avenue, Hayden Avenue/Waltham Street, and Hayden
                                Avenue/Route 2 WB Off-Ramp.

                                In the year 2000, the Town used the roadway improvement funds to install
                                traffic islands and flood lights at three of the area intersections (Spring
                                Street/Hayden Avenue, Spring Street/Concord Avenue, and Hayden
                                Avenue/Waltham Street) to provide a safer environment for the police
                                officers to control traffic at these locations. The police details are voluntary
                                assignments and at present none of the intersections are under police control.

If the aforementioned police control mitigation, committed to by others, were
implemented, the capacity analysis results show that the intersections that
were expected to operate at LOS E or F under No-Build and Build traffic
volumes (see Tables 7 and 9) would operate at an overall LOS C or better, as
indicated in Tables 12 and 13. Police controlled intersections have similar
operating characteristics to signalized intersections. Therefore, these police
controlled intersections are analyzed as signalized intersections. Overall
LOS for a signalized intersection can be measured and is reported in Table
12 and 13.

5.2      Project Mitigation Commitments

In order to enhance future traffic operations, the project proponent, 95
Hayden will make a financial contribution to the Town to fund off-site
transportation infrastructure improvements along Spring Street and/or
Hayden Avenue and/or in South Lexington, that benefit the neighborhood
and project. The amount of the contribution will be determined through
discussions with the Town. This contribution will be provided after the
issuance of a building permit by the Town for the proposed building. These
improvements could include (but shall not be limited to):

          Design/Construction of improvements/signal at Marrett Road/Spring
          Street intersection;
          Design/Construction of sidewalks along Spring Street;
          Design/Construction of sidewalks along Hayden Avenue;
          Design/Construction of a traffic signal at Spring Street/Hayden
          Avenue intersection;
          Design/Construction of improvements/signal at Waltham
          Street/Hayden Avenue


The project proponent will also assist the Town in obtaining grant financing
for public infrastructure improvements. The Town could be eligible for
grants, such as the Massachusetts Opportunity Relocation and Expansion
(MORE), Public Works and Economic Development (PWED) and
Infrastructure Investment Incentive (I-Cubed) programs offered by the
Commonwealth. The extent and length of this assistance will be discussed
with the Town. The assistance will be provided after the issuance of a
building permit by the Town for the proposed building.

95 Hayden will also commit to an annual financial contribution to a
transportation fund devoted to assuring the continued provision of
transportation services by the Town. These services include LEXPRESS and
transportation coordination services. The amount of the contribution will be
determined through discussions with the Town. This contribution will be
provided upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy and occupancy of the
proposed building. At the end of the fifth full year of operation, and
annually each year thereafter, 95 Hayden and the Town shall review
LEXPRESS ridership levels at the site. If there is inadequate ridership,
LEXPRESS service may be discontinued to the site and the annual financial
contribution will cease to be paid.

5.3      Transportation Demand Management

In an effort to reduce the number of single occupancy vehicles traveling to
and from the site, the proponent will implement a comprehensive
transportation demand management (TDM) plan. The Town of Lexington
has adopted a comprehensive Transportation Demand Management Policy
(Adopted September 16, 1998). The proponent has reviewed the Policy and
is prepared to implement the necessary elements at the proposed building in
order to reduce demand for transportation facilities. The measures detailed in
this plan will be implemented upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy and
occupancy of the proposed building.

The following TDM plan presented in this section follows the outline
presented in the Policy.


1. Site Design

      Transportation Elements in the site design:
       The site will be designed with adequate driveway widths, turning
         radii and vertical clearances to accommodate alternative
         transportation services vehicles, including LEXPRESS and Alewife
         Shuttle vehicles LEXPRESS and Alewife Shuttle stops will be
         located near entrances to major buildings on the site. If required, the
         buildings can serve as refuge for passengers. The internal site
         roadways offer opportunities for these vehicles to change travel
         directions.
       Suitable signage will be provided directing passengers to drop-off
         and pick-up locations.
       Proposed pedestrian routes have been designed to minimize
         pedestrian-vehicle conflicts.

      Preferential parking, located in close proximity to the buildings, will be
      provided for vehicles used for vanpools.

2. Transportation Information

          95 Hayden, will designate from its management staff a
          Transportation Coordinator for the property. The coordinator will be
          responsible for implementing the TDM plan and will manage and
          oversee all transportation matters. The Transportation Coordinator
          will serve as the contact and liaison with the Town, with other
                                                TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY
                                             THREE LEDGEMONT office building
                                                   LEXINGTON, MAssachusetts
                                                                  PAGE 48




         entities (such as the 128 Business Council), and with other property
         owners in the South Lexington area, and with all employees and
         visitors for the site.

    i.      The Transportation Coordinator will provide convenient access to
            well organized data, including at an information center in a
            common area of the proposed building. Current or prospective
            users of alternative transportation services can learn of the many
            options available. Additionally, a call box will be installed in the
            new building that will allow a user to call for more information
            regarding transportation options, routes, etc. This call box will be
            answered by a live operator.

   ii.      The Transportation Coordinator will promote alternative
            transportation services such as carpooling, vanpooling and the use
            of public transit on the site through the information center located
            in the proposed building. Information will also be available from
            the office of the Transportation Coordinator, in addition to
            postings on an Internet web site that is accessible to all employees
            of the Ledgemont Corporate Center. The site will contain
            information on alternative transportation services, such as
            ridesharing options, and will also contain links to other web sites,
            such as those operated by the MBTA, the 128 Business Council,
            MassRides and eRideshare. The Transportation Coordinator will
            also participate in and support the promotional activities of
            organizations, such as the 128 Business Council, that wish to
            promote alternative modes of transportation that will serve the
            site.


3. Connection to the Existing Public Fixed Route Transportation System

   The site is located within six miles of the MBTA's Alewife Red line
   subway station. Shuttle buses, operated by the 128 Business Council,
   operate between Alewife Station and a number of properties in the Route
   2/Route 128 corridor. The shuttle bus currently serves some of the
   tenants on the Ledgemont property. As a part of this project, 95 Hayden
   is committed to becoming a member of the 128 Business Council,
   representing potentially all the tenants on the site and expanding the use
   of the shuttle to mitigate incremental traffic impacts.

         The Transportation Coordinator for the property will maintain and
         promote information about public fixed route transportation services
         available to employees who work on the property. These services
         include MBTA bus and subway service, LEXPRESS bus service and

                                                 LEXINGTON, MAssachusetts
                                                                PAGE 49




       the shuttle service to Alewife Station. The material (schedules, route
       maps etc.,) will be prominently displayed at the information center
       on the property and copies of the material will be available upon
       request to the coordinator.

       95 Hayden will encourage its tenants to subsidize the entire cost to
       any employee for usage of:

       o   Fixed route public transportation systems, such as the MBTA or
           LEXPRESS, or
       o   The shuttle service to Alewife Station, or
       o   Other private shuttles operated by area businesses

       95 Hayden will also commit to an annual financial contribution to a
       transportation fund devoted to assuring the continued provision of
       transportation services by the Town. These services include
       LEXPRESS and transportation coordination services. The amount of
       the contribution will be determined through discussions with the
       Town. At the end of the fifth full year of operation, and annually
       each year thereafter, 95 Hayden and LEXPRESS shall review
       LEXPRESS ridership levels at the site. If both 95 Hayden and the
       Town agree, LEXPRESS service may be discontinued to the site and
       the annual financial contribution will cease to be paid.

       95 Hayden will express its support for the extension of MBTA Bus
       Route #78 to Hayden Avenue, which would provide a bus link
       between South Lexington, Arlington and Cambridge.

       LEXPRESS and Alewife Shuttle stops will be located near entrances
       to major buildings on the site. If required, the buildings can serve as
       refuge for passengers.


4. Outreach to Areas Not Serviced Well by Existing Public Transportation
   Systems

   The majority of the employees expected to occupy the proposed building
   are projected to reside in areas outside of the Town of Lexington. A
   ridesharing program will be established in an effort to accommodate
   those employees that will not be well served by existing public
   transportation network. The Transportation Coordinator will develop a
   database of on-site employees expressing their willingness to participate
   in ridesharing.

   Efforts to match local, off-site candidates will be undertaken in
   conjunction with the 128 Business Council, which currently has
   programs to match interested rideshare participants on different sites.

       The Transportation Coordinator will encourage the use of alternate
       transportation, such carpooling or vanpooling, through education
       programs directed at employees and visitors, that highlight the need
       for and existence of available alternate transportation services.
       Actions include the distribution of the 128 Business Council
       Newsletter, which promotes various transportation alternatives that
       are offered by the organization.

       Preferential parking spaces, for vehicles used for vanpooling, will be
       allocated in convenient locations.

       95 Hayden will encourage its tenants to subsidize the entire cost to
       any employee for usage of a vanpool pass.

       The proponent will continue to work with the 128 Business Council,
       the Transportation Coordinator, and the Lexington Transportation
       Advisory Committee to address areas where ridesharing can be
       enhanced.

       The Transportation Coordinator will be an active member and
       participant in promotional activities for alternative transportation
       services (provided by the 128 Business Council or other
       organizations, such as MassRides).

       The Transportation Coordinator will post information on day care
       centers that are located in close proximity to the Ledgemont site.


5. Other Trip Reduction Techniques

       Parking to be constructed for the new building will provided at a
       ratio of 3.2 spaces per 1,000 SF (net floor area)

       Preferred parking spaces will be provided for 3 vanpool vehicles

       95 Hayden will encourage tenants to accommodate employees who
       wish to work outside of the office. This can be accomplished in a
       numbers of ways, including providing a means for employees to
       access company files from an off-site location (i.e., telecommuting).

                                                                PAGE 51




       95 Hayden will encourage tenants to implement staggered work
       hours, flex time and spread scheduling. These measures will reduce
       the number of peak hour trips made to and from the site.

       95 Hayden will encourage tenants to provide Internet access to their
       employees such that online banking and shopping transactions can be
       executed electronically, reducing the likelihood that vehicle trips will
       be made by employees during the work day.

       95 Hayden will seek to develop a relationship with a preferred
       vendor for the provision of car rental and/or car sharing services such
       as Avis, Hertz, Enterprise, ZipCar, and UCar Share to encourage
       employees on the site, who do not drive their personal vehicles to the
       site, to avail themselves of a car rental/car share service when the
       need for a vehicle arises. With implementation, employees would
       receive preferential rates for the rentals and would be able to
       conveniently reserve a vehicle over the Internet. 95 Hayden is
       prepared to allocate a reserved parking space(s) for such a vehicle(s).

       Employees that are eligible to use the Alewife Shuttle can also
       participate in the "Guaranteed Ride Home" program offered by the
       128 Business Council. The program provides for taxi rides home for
       employees, should the situation arise.

       Preferred parking for low-emitting and fuel-efficient vehicles will be
       provided.


6. Other Travel Modes

       Bicycle racks (accommodating approximately 40 bikes) that are
       secure and protected from the weather, shall be provided. Shower
       and locker facilities will also be provided

       In an effort to encourage bicycle usage, financial incentives to those
       who travel to and from the site by bicycle will be explored. This
       might include discounts for maintenance of bicycles for bicycle
       commuters.

       95 Hayden will make bicycles available to site users, through the
       Transportation Coordinator, during the day such that the users can
       opt to use a bicycle to make short trips during the day, so that they
       will not have to drive their personal automobile.

       95 Hayden will make a financial contribution to the Town that will
       be used by the Town to design and construct pedestrian and/or
       bicycle infrastructure improvements that abut the project site.

       95 Hayden will provide an extension of the existing easement on
       private property for pedestrian passage on the Greenway from Spring
       Street.


7. Coordination with Other Transportation Demand Management Activities

       As previously stated, 95 Hayden will become an active member of
       the 128 Business Council, this region's transportation management
       association.

       95 Hayden will continue its membership in the South Lexington
       Transportation Task Force

       Membership in a local ozone awareness program, in which
       employers will be encouraged to notify employees of expected poor
       air quality and suggest ways that they might minimize polluting
       behaviors


8. Related Development Actions

       A building cafeteria will be provided for employees in the proposed
       building, in order to reduce the amount of trips made during the day,
       and to encourage employees to use alternative means of
       transportation.

       Basic support services for employees and business operations on site
       will be provided so they do not have to drive elsewhere to obtain
       those services. These include food service and automatic teller
       machines


9. Transportation Reporting

       A survey of employees regularly employed on the site will be
       conducted annually for the first three years following the opening of
       the proposed building. The results of the survey will detail the
       number of employees using each of the following modes of
       transportation:

           o   SOV's
           o   Carpools
           o   Vanpools
           o   Public Transportation (MBTA, LEXPRESS)
           o   Private Shuttle (Alewife Shuttle)
           o   Bicycling
           o   Walking

       Additionally, the survey will indicate the number of employees who
       follow flex-time hours and those who telecommute and the degree to
       which this is done.

       The survey results will also detail site arrival and departure times for
       persons regularly employed at the site as well as their zip code of
       origin.

       The results of the survey will be compiled and used to compare with
       the Transportation Demand Management Plan. The results will be
       summarized and submitted to the Lexington Town Transportation
       Coordinator.

6.0 Conclusions

Using standard traffic engineering practices, this Traffic Impact Study has:

    Reviewed existing traffic and roadway conditions in the vicinity of the
    site;

    Determined background traffic growth for the study area between 2008
    and 2013;

    Estimated and distributed the additional vehicular traffic that will be
    generated by the proposed expansion; and

    Presented an evaluation of traffic impacts due to the implementation of
    the proposed project.

This study shows that:

    Based on Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation
    methodology, the proposed office development is expected to generate
    no more than 194 incremental trips (171 entering, 23 exiting) during the
    weekday morning peak and 191 incremental trips (33 entering, 158
    exiting) during the weekday afternoon peak hour. On a daily basis, the
    proposed building is expected to generate no more than 1,277
    incremental trips.

    Based on recent vehicle counts taken at the site, the observed rates of the
    existing Ledgemont Corporate Center are actually approximately 60
    percent of the ITE standard rates. The use of the ITE standard
    methodology to project trip generation of the proposed building can
    therefore be considered to be very conservative (i.e. overestimating the
    number of trips and therefore overestimating the projected impacts on the
    local roadway network).

   LOS analyses were conducted at intersections that are likely to be
   affected by the proposed office building under the existing and future
   traffic volumes with (Build) and without (No-Build) the construction of
   the proposed office building. The following summarizes the traffic
   capacity analyses results for each of the intersections:

           Under existing traffic volume conditions, five intersections will
           have movements that operate at LOS E or F during peak hours,
           inadequate capacity, as defined by the Town. They are:

                           Marrett Road (Route 2A) at Spring Street/Bridge
                           Street
                           Spring Street at Hayden Avenue/Patriot Way
                           Spring Street at Concord Avenue
                           Hayden Avenue at Route 2 WB Off-Ramp
                           Hayden Avenue at Waltham Street


           In the future, traffic signals and other improvements are expected
           to be implemented by the Town at the intersection of Marrett
           Road/Spring Street/Bridge Street, raising its operating condition
           to LOS D or better under No-Build and Build conditions, during
           the peak hours.

           Police control is expected to be implemented at the intersection
           of Spring Street at Hayden Avenue/Patriot Way, once the
           Lexington Technology Park development becomes increasingly
           occupied. This measure is expected to raise the operations at this
           intersection to LOS D or better during the peak hours.

           Given the aforementioned improvements at the two locations,
           three intersections will have movements that do not operate at
           adequate capacity during the peak hours under No-Build and
           Build traffic volume conditions:

                           Spring Street at Concord Avenue
                           Hayden Avenue at Route 2 WB Off-Ramp
                           Hayden Avenue at Waltham Street

           As part of their local permit approval processes, many prior
           development projects in South Lexington had agreed to provide
           traffic impact mitigation in various forms, including physical
           improvements to the local roadways and absorbing the cost of

            providing traffic control implemented by police officers. Police
            officer traffic control is one of the commitments that had been
            made by others, at the three intersections with inadequate
            capacity under No-Build and Build conditions. If police control
            at these three intersections were implemented at these
            intersections during the peak periods, the intersections are
            expected to operate at an overall LOS D or better.

    In order to enhance future traffic operations, the project proponent, 95
    Hayden will make a financial contribution to the Town to fund off-site
    priority transportation improvements in South Lexington that benefit the
    project. These priority projects will be identified in conjunction with the
    Town. Additionally, 95 Hayden will assist the Town in obtaining grant
    financing for infrastructure improvements in South Lexington.

    In order to promote the use of alternate modes of transportation and
    reduce the number of single occupancy vehicles, the proponent has
    committed to implement a Transportation Demand Management Plan for
    the proposed facility based on the guidelines provided by the Town of
    Lexington's "Transportation Demand Management Policy". The
    comprehensive plan will involve proactive measures to reduce vehicles
    traveling to and from the site.


This study indicates that the area roadways and intersections can
accommodate the construction of the office building at the Ledgemont
Corporate Center. Proposed transportation demand management measures
are expected to reduce the use of single occupant vehicles associated with the
site.

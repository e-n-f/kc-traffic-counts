                          2.0     PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This section provides background information and a general description of the Education
and Innovation Instructional Facility project site.

2.1   LOCATION

The Leeward Community College campus is located between Waipahu and Pearl City, in
Central Oÿahu, State of Hawaiÿi (Figure 1). The proposed Education and Innovation
Instructional Facility will be located makai of the large parking lot, in an area next to the
Theatre Plaza on the LCC campus. Photographs of the site are included as Figure 3.

2.2   DESCRIPTION OF THE EDUCATION AND INNOVATION INSTRUCTIONAL
      FACILITY

Leeward Community College opened its doors in the fall of 1968 as the first college in the
University of Hawaiÿi system to be developed without a connection to a pre-existing
technical school. LCC's guiding principle was "innovation" -- a readiness to depart from
tradition in order to bring the best of its current educational practices to its students.

In 1968, Leonard T. Tuthill, LCC's first Provost, welcomed over 1,640 students into
buildings that once housed Pearl City Kai Elementary School. The first semester witnessed
more than twice the anticipated number of students ready to explore the "community
college" experience.

In the spring of 1969, LCC moved to its current location, on approximately 50 acres near
the geographic center of Oÿahu between Pearl City and Waipahu. Since its initial opening
in temporary facilities, student enrollment in credit classes has grown so that the college is
the second largest community college and the third largest campus of any kind in the
State. Fall 2009 headcount enrollment was 7,484 students (full-time and part-time) and
the full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment was 4,341 students. Students are regularly
enrolled each semester in liberal arts and career and technical educational programs
offered on campus, at off-campus locations in the community, and through distance
education courses. Distance education courses offered on-line or through a hybrid of
classroom and on-line environments are a growing trend and are expected to continue.
Of the nearly 7,484 students enrolled in Fall 2009, thirty percent of these students (2,259
students) took at least one of their courses through a distance education modality. This
was an 18 percent increase from the previous year and an 87 percent increase over a
three-year time period.

Leeward Community College Wai`anae (LCCW) is a satellite campus located on the
beautiful Wai`anae coast of Oÿahu. It offers a variety of first and second year college
credit classes in liberal arts, education, business, and career and technical areas. Students

can complete a majority of the course requirements for an Associate of Arts or an
Associate of Arts in Teaching degree at LCCW. Courses are offered days and evenings, and
Saturdays during the fall and spring semesters. In addition, students can access LCC
online courses through LCCW. Non-credit courses are also offered at various times
throughout the year.

In 1999, LCC prepared a Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) and Environmental
Assessment (EA) for a 30-year plan for the LCC campus development. The EA was
approved by the UH Community Colleges on February 11, 1999. The Leeward
Community College Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) was attached to PRU No.
1999/PRU-1, which was approved by Resolution 99-359, CD-1. LCC is currently
operating under Plan Review Use (PRU) Permit No. 1999/PRU-1 (Resolution No. 99-
359, CD-1), approved on March 15, 2000, for the "Thirty-Year Master Plan To Allow the
Construction of New School Facilities, Expansion and Interior Renovations to Existing
Buildings, and Upgrading of Infrastructure Improvements" (Appendix B).

In the LRDP, the site for the proposed project was to be occupied by the "Business
Ed./Language Arts" building. The New Education and Innovation Instructional Facility
(EIIF) is identified as the "Social Science" building in the 1999 LRDP. In discussions
with the County's Department of Planning and Permitting (DPP), it was determined that
the proposed project is different from the 1999 version of the LRDP, and that a minor
modification would need to be made to the existing PRU permit (Resolution No. 99-359,
CD-1).

The Social Science Division (SSD) is the only department without its own dedicated
facility, therefore, offices and classes are currently dispersed throughout the entire LCC
campus. The proposed project will provide a single facility for the SSD, enhancing
operational efficiency and improving the learning environment. The proposed EIIF
project will provide spaces to support the functions and needs for SSD programs,
including American Studies, Anthropology, Economics, Geography, Political Science,
Psychology, Sociology, Social Sciences, Women's Studies, Interdisciplinary Studies,
Human Services and Law. The Teacher Training program, which addresses Hawaiÿi's
teacher shortage and other needs for the Leeward community, will be also facilitated in
the proposed EIIF building.

Supportive Teacher Education Program - Hawaiÿi continues to have a critical shortage of
trained teachers within the public school system. Research indicates that teacher quality
is one of the most influential factors in student achievement. The mission of the LCC
Supportive Teacher Education Program (STEP) is to recruit and support local students into
becoming highly qualified teachers in their own communities.

STEP is a teacher preparation program that supports students who are interested in
pursuing a career in elementary, secondary, and/or special education. The STEP program

prepares students to successfully achieve the Associate in Arts in Teaching (AAT) degree
and provides a solid foundation for those students interested in pursuing a baccalaureate
degree in Education.

STEP offers the following support opportunities for developing teachers:
    Explorations in Teaching weekly seminars;
    Counseling and academic advising services;
    Service learning experiences; and
    LCC Future Teachers Club.

In addition to the LCC teacher education program, articulation and transfer agreements
with four-year colleges and universities have been signed or are in various stages of the
planning process. For instance, LCC and Chaminade University of Honolulu recently
signed an agreement whereby Chaminade will offer their upper division teacher education
classes on the LCC campus.

Teaching/Remediation Innovation Instruction Center - In order to address the remedial and
developmental educational needs of students, the Innovation Instruction Center is
intended to support a learner-centered culture which will help students persist and
succeed in their postsecondary careers. In the UHCC system, 62% of new students place
into remedial/developmental writing courses and 81% of new students place into
remedial/developmental math courses.

The facility needs required to support the remedial and developmental students includes a
technology-rich and adaptable environment capable of supporting self-paced and
accelerated learning models. The space will include a mix of individual and group study
areas and integrate tutoring, advising, and other academic and student support services.

Academic and Student Support Services:

Student Resource Center - The Student Resource Center would include state-of-the-art
materials and resources (books, computers, equipment, supplies, etc.) available for use by
students and faculty to enhance their instructional needs. The space would include a
variety of individual and group study/work configuration spaces and would promote the
use of various forms of activities and research required by students to present any kind of
activity in a K-12 classroom.

Lecture Halls ­ Large Meeting Area Space - One of the most pressing LCC campus space
requirements is the need to schedule large classes or groups (internal or external to the
campus). Two (2) lecture halls are proposed, one with a seating capacity of up to 100
students and one with a seating capacity of 50 students. Ideally, these spaces could also
be combined in order to accommodate up to 150 students or guests to a class/meeting.

The new educational facility will be connected to LCC's Theater Plaza via a future
staircase and a covered walkway (Figures 4 and 5). The new facility will also be
connected to the Koko-head portion of LCC's parking lot via a pedestrian bridge. A
pedestrian path at the lower plaza, running ÿEwa to Koko-head, will connect to the rest of
the campus. Bioretention basins will be installed along this pathway. A green roof is also
planned as part of an environmentally-conscious design strategy.

In total, the LCC EIIF will include approximately 18,328 square feet (sf) of space, of which
2,043 sf will be dedicated to a teacher education office suite; 2,094 sf to a teacher
education/home away from home space, including a case study/seminar room and a
classroom; 9,925 sf to common and shared spaces, including a conference room, student
resource center, and approximately nine classrooms; and 4,265 sf to non-assignable
spaces, including restrooms, stairwells, lobby areas, janitorial maintenance rooms, etc.

2.3 PROJECT COST AND IMPLEMENTATION TIMEFRAME
LCC hopes to commence construction in 2012. Construction should run a duration of 16
months to 24 months. LCC estimates construction to cost approximately $11.4 million in

      3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT,
        POTENTIAL IMPACTS, AND MITIGATIVE MEASURES
This section describes the existing conditions of the physical or natural environment,
potential impacts of the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility to the
environment, and mitigation measures to minimize impacts.

3.1   CLIMATE

Average annual daily minimum and maximum temperatures in the Project Area are 65
and 84 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively. The annual prevailing wind direction for this
area of Oÿahu is east northeast, about 40 percent of the time, at approximately 10 knots
(12 miles per hour). This portion of Oÿahu experiences very little rainfall, with a mean
annual precipitation of between 25 to 35 inches per year, most of which occurs between
the months of November and April.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The design process will take into account and address the effects of solar heat gain and
exposure along both the south and west facing portions of the Education and Innovation
Instructional Facility. Currently being considered for use are: a green roof, sunshading
devices, high-performance glazing, and other design strategies/technologies that could
help to reduce the thermal loading on these sides of the building.

It should also be noted that the existing walkway traps radiant heat when exposed to
direct sunlight. The roof of the proposed structure will be located above most of the
surrounding buildings (except for the Theatre) and will be designed with a green roof to
reduce heat gain in order to reduce the expense to cool the proposed Education and
Innovation Instructional Facility. A green roof is a roof of a building that is partially or
completely covered with vegetation and soil, or a growing medium, planted over a
waterproofing membrane. Other measures currently being studied to reduce the demand
for air-conditioning include: use of daylighting (in this case a solar tube and maximizing
window openings), and the use of appropriate thermal insulation at the building exterior
walls and roof.

3.2   TOPOGRAPHY

LCC is located on a bluff that overlooks Pearl Harbor and the surrounding Waipahu and
Pearl City communities. Elevations of LCC range from 98 feet above mean sea level
(msl) at the western corner of the larger parking lot to 32 feet above msl at the southern
corner of the site with grades ranging from 2% to 50%. The mauka portions of the LCC,
especially the larger parking lot are generally level while the steeper grades transition

throughout the campus in the makai direction. The steepest embankments occur along
the makai boundaries of the campus.

Also, because of the large amount of human development on the LCC campus, the areas
around the project site have experienced profuse grading activity, as evidenced by the
terraced condition of the site, where the proposed project will occur. The Education and
Innovation Instructional Facility project site is relatively level on the eastern portion of the
site, but then splits with one portion rising up to meet the grade of the large parking lot
fronting the Theatre, and the other portion sloping downward to meet the level of the
Theatre box office and entrance.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

To reduce the apparent massing and height of the building when viewed from mauka
areas, the proposed structure will be built into the hillside (similar to the existing
buildings immediately makai of the larger parking lot) requiring significant grading, with
the mauka wall of the lowest floor serving as a retaining wall. The grading will not
change the topographic nature of the parcel relative to the surrounding lands, since the
development of the existing campus involved similar grading. Civil site work shall
include removal of existing pavement, clearing and grubbing, grading, and perimeter
walkways.

A National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit will be required for
the project since the demolition, construction and staging areas results in the disturbance
of over one (1) acre of land area. Best Management Practices (BMP) will be
implemented to prevent pollution and protect the environment. In addition, The project
will have an erosion and sedimentation control plan prepared to address all construction
activities.

3.3   SOILS

Three soil suitability studies prepared for lands in Hawaiÿi principally focus on the
relative agricultural productivity of different land types. These studies are: 1) the U.S.
Department of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Survey; 2)
the University of Hawaiÿi Land Study Bureau Detailed Land Classification; and 3) the
State Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Lands of Importance to the State of
Hawaiÿi (ALISH).

3.3.1      Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
The Natural Resource Conservation Service, Soil Survey for the Island of Oÿahu, classifies
the soil underlying LCC as: Waipahu silty clays (WzA, WzC) (Figure 6).

Waipahu silty clay, 0 to 2 percent slopes (WzA). Permeability is moderately slow. Runoff
is slow or very slow, and the erosion hazard is none to slight.

Waipahu silty clay, 6 to 12 percent slopes (WzC). On this soil, runoff is medium and the
erosion hazard is moderate.

3.3.2     Land Study Bureau Detailed Land Classification
The University of Hawaiÿi Land Study Bureau document, Detailed Land Classification,
Island of Oÿahu, classifies soils based on a productivity rating. Letters indicate class of
productivity with A representing the highest class and E the lowest. The soils of the entire
LCC campus are classified as Urban (Figure 7).

3.3.3     Agricultural Lands of Importance to the State of Hawaiÿi (ALISH)
The Agricultural Lands of Importance to the State of Hawaiÿi (ALISH) system classify
important agricultural lands as Prime, Unique, or Other Agricultural Land. The Education
and Innovation Instructional Facility project site lands are not classified (Figure 8).

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Construction of the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will not have a
deleterious effect on the soil in the project site. The soils at the project site are not well
suited for crop cultivation. In addition, the site has been previously modified to
accommodate the development of the existing campus. As such, the proposed
development should not impact the availability of agricultural land for cultivation.

3.4     NATURAL HAZARDS

Natural hazards like flooding, tsunami inundation, hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic
eruptions have historically impacted Hawaiÿi Island.

Flooding
According to the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), National Flood Insurance Program, the project site is
located in "Zone X", out of the 500-year flood plain (Figure 9).

The site sits in a dry and arid environment where the risks of flooding are low due to a
combination of factors, including low rainfall, and the topography of the site.

                            DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Tsunami
Since the early 1800s, approximately 50 tsunamis have inundated Hawaiÿi's shores.
Seven historical events have caused major damage. Two tsunami were generated locally.
The proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility is located well outside the
defined tsunami inundation area.

Hurricanes
Since 1980, two hurricanes have had a devastating effect on Hawaiÿi: Hurricane ÿIwa in
1982 and Hurricane ÿIniki in 1992. Long-term prediction of future hurricanes is virtually
impossible. However, one should reasonably anticipate the prospect of another hurricane
impacting the islands.

Earthquake & Volcanic Hazards
In Hawaiÿi, volcanic activity produces most earthquakes in contrast to other areas sitting
on tectonic plate margins. Thousands of earthquakes occur in Hawaiÿi each year.
However, the vast majority of them are undetectable through normal human senses. A
few historical earthquakes have reached moderate and even disastrous magnitudes.

The last earthquakes felt statewide were magnitudes of 6.7 and 6.0. These earthquakes
occurred at Kïholo Bay along Hawaiÿi Island's Kona Coast on October 15, 2006. These
earthquakes resulted in more than $100 million in damages to the northwest area of
Hawaiÿi Island and minimal damage on Oÿahu. From that same event, Oÿahu was also
subject to an earthquake induced electrical blackout that paralyzed the city of Honolulu
and shut down the Honolulu International Airport for nearly a day.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The Education and Innovation Instructional Facility should not have any impact or any
deleterious effects on natural hazard conditions and no unique mitigative measures are
planned, other than observing the International Building Code in the design of the facility
(to address the potential impacts from hurricanes and earthquakes).

3.5   FLORA & FAUNA

The LCC has been subject to intense human utilization since its construction starting in
1969. Within the immediate proximity of the project site, there are no known habitats for
rare, threatened, or endangered flora or faunal species. The main landscaping features of
the site include a grassed area between the Theatre Plaza and the portion of the Education
and Innovation Instructional Facility that sits over an existing parking lot.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The proposed project will involve the removal of a portion of an existing paved parking
lot, as well as a portion of the grassed area between the parking lot and Theatre Plaza.
However, the proposed project will not have any impact on endangered flora or faunal
species. No mitigation measures are planned.

   4.0     DESCRIPTION OF THE HUMAN ENVIRONMENT, POTENTIAL
                 IMPACTS, AND MITIGATIVE MEASURES

This section describes the existing conditions of the human environment, potential
impacts of the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility, and mitigation measures to
minimize any impacts.

4.1     ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES

4.1.1     Archaeological Resources
The project site consists of a portion of an existing paved parking lot and a grassed lawn,
and has been heavily modified by construction related to the LCC campus. Previous
studies have revealed historic properties (human burials) on the opposite side of the LCC
campus on lands from the proposed EIIF building site below the bluff where a large
population of early Chinese immigrants settled.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Hawaiÿi Revised Statutes Section 6E-8 mandates the review of proposed state projects on
historic sites by the State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD). The University does not
anticipate any adverse impact to archeological resources as a result of construction. The
succession of construction projects and grading activities has extensively disturbed the
project area, making the possibility of encountering any remaining surface, or sub-surface
features unlikely. Based on prior grubbing and grading activities, and paving of the
existing parking lot, it is unlikely that the proposed project would not have an adverse
impact on any significant historic properties. During the pre-consultation period, SHPD
commented that "no historic properties affected." Should the inadvertent discovery of
significant cultural materials and/or burials occur during construction, all work in the
immediate area of the find must cease and the SHPD be notified.

4.1.2      Cultural Resources
The Final Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact for the
Leeward Community College Second Access (November 2007), included a Cultural
Impact Assessment for the Leeward Community College Second Access Project, Waipio
and Waiawa Ahupuaa, Ewa District, Oahu (TMK 9-4-8:10, 23, 25 9-6-03) prepared by
Cultural Surveys Hawaii, Inc. (CSH) in August 2005. CSH contacted Hawaiian
organizations, agencies and community members in order to identify potentially
knowledgeable individuals with cultural expertise and/or knowledge of the LCC campus
area. The organizations consulted by CSH included the State Historic Preservation
Division, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the Oahu Burial Council and the Waipahu
Neighborhood Board. CSH determined that there were cultural practices related to
fishing (the shoreline is makai of the LCC campus property). Additionally, historic

documentation and interviews refer to burials associated, culturally and historically with
the early Chinese settlement on the opposite side of the LCC campus from the proposed
EIIF building site below the bluff. It should be noted that the project site consists mostly
of an existing paved and landscaped area, and does not appear to provide any resources
of use or interest to native Hawaiian cultural practitioners, such as fishing, burials, food
gathering, shelter, tool or weapon making, kapa-making, traditional medicines, lei
making, etc. The closest site on University lands where native Hawaiian culture is
actively practiced is along the shoreline, which is approximately 2,000 feet from the
project site.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility is located away from the
shoreline and should not have an adverse impact on the native Hawaiian cultural
practices occurring there. Should iwi kupuna or Native Hawaiian cultural or traditional
deposits be found during ground disturbance or excavation, work will cease, and the
appropriate agencies will be contacted pursuant to applicable law.

Based on historical research and the heavily modified nature of the LCC campus, it is
reasonable to conclude that, pursuant to Act 50, the exercise of Hawaiian rights, or any
ethnic group, related to gathering, access or other customary activities within the project
parcels will not be affected and there will be no direct adverse effect upon cultural
practices or beliefs.

4.2   ROADWAYS AND TRAFFIC

LCC is situated on a parcel of land makai of the Waiawa Freeway Interchange which
accommodates the H-1 Freeway, H-2 Freeway, Farrington Highway, and Kamehameha
Highway. The following is a breakdown of the roadways most pertinent to the LCC
campus.

Farrington Highway. Farrington Highway is a State Principal Arterial Highway that
connects Central and West Oÿahu. The division and grade separation of the divided
highway is quite pronounced in the vicinity of LCC, with the highway at a lower
elevation than the LCC campus. Farrington Highway connects to Kamehameha
Highway in the vicinity of Pearl Highlands Shopping Center. The posted speed limit on
the west-bound (WB) side is 35 miles per hour (mph) and 30 mph on the east-bound (EB)
side. Farrington Highway (WB) and Waiawa Drive form a stop-controlled intersection
and Farrington Highway (EB) and Waiawa Drive form a signalized intersection.

Ala Ike Street. This two-lane local road provides sole access to the LCC campus. Ala Ike
Street acts as a spine that collects vehicles from LCC's parking lot. Ala Ike Street runs in
a west-east orientation, running parallel with the H-1 Freeway and then connecting the

residential neighborhood east (makai) of LCC to the Waiawa Drive Overpass. Ala Ike
Street has a curb and gutter and sidewalk improvements on its western end, and curb
and gutter for half of its length on the eastern side. It ends in a cul-de-sac approximately
720 feet makai of the Waiawa Drive Overpass. Two unstriped, single-lane roads radiate
off of the cul-de-sac and lead to further residential areas. The western leg that projects
from the cul-de-sac travels along the western, makai border of LCC. However, there
does not appear to be any connectivity to LCC via this makai portion of roadway. No
speed limit signs are posted on Ala Ike Street.

Waiawa Drive. Waiawa Drive is a two-lane collector road that provides access over the
H-1 Freeway via the Waiawa Drive Overpass which emanates from a T-intersection with
Ala Ike Street and heads mauka of the LCC campus. The EB and WB approaches of Ala
Ike Street are stop-controlled at this T-intersection. At its mauka terminus, Waiawa
Drive forms two separate intersections with Farrington Highway (approximately 220 feet
apart). The makai-most intersection provides access to Farrington Highway EB and is
signalized. The mauka-most intersection provides access to Farrington Highway WB
with the NB Waiawa Drive approach being stop-controlled. The posted speed limit on
Waiawa Drive is 25 mph.

A traffic study was prepared for the project by PB Americas, Inc. in March 2010 to
identify traffic conditions. This report is included as Appendix C.

Turning movement counts were recorded at the three intersections in the vicinity of LCC
on October 28, 2009 and supplemented with counts taken in November 2007. These
intersections were: Ala Ike Street and Waiawa Drive, Waiawa Drive and Farrington
Highway (EB), and Waiawa Drive and Farrington Highway (WB). Data was collected
from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The two-hour periods were selected
after discussions with the LCC administrative staff and a review of the LCC schedule of
classes revealed that traffic into and out of the campus would be heaviest at these times.
Data from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. was collected from November 2007. The peak hours were
found to be: 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. in the morning, 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. in the
afternoon, and 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. in the evening.

At the Ala Ike Street and Waiawa Drive intersection, the EB Ala Ike through-left turn
movement operates poorly during the mid-day peak hour (Level of Service [LOS] F). It
reflects the queuing of vehicles leaving the LCC parking lot after mid-day classes are
finished. The synchronization of class dismissals at LCC in the mid-day leads to the
release of hundreds of outbound vehicles onto Ala Ike Street during short periods of
time. Upon observation, it was determined that similar congested conditions occur
around 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., as well. This Farrington Highway (EB) and Waiawa Drive
intersection operates at LOS B during the AM peak hour, LOS C during the mid-day peak
hour, and LOS B during the PM peak hour. During the mid-day peak hour, the NB
Waiawa Drive left turn at the Farrington Highway (WB) and Waiawa Drive intersection

experiences excessive delay (LOS F) due to the lack of sufficient gaps in the Farrington
Highway WB traffic and the increase in vehicles from LCC seeking these gaps. The WB
Farrington Highway movements run free and therefore experience minimal control
delay. A summary of the existing intersection LOS is shown in Table 4-1.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Projected Year 2015 Traffic Operations without Project

By the year 2015, UH West Oÿahu is anticipated to be relocated to East Kapolei. For the
purposes of the traffic study, PB Americas, Inc. projected LCC's enrollment to be 9,077
students, up 19% from the combined enrollment of LCC and UH West Oÿahu in 2009.
The anticipated increase in enrollment will create an overall increase in traffic volumes
at the three intersections nearest the campus.

In addition, the background traffic along Farrington Highway (both in the EB and WB
directions) and Ala Ike Street, east of the Waiawa Drive Overpass, is projected to grow at
an annualized rate of 0.9% according to the 2030 Oahu Travel Demand Forecasting
Model (OTDFM).

The LCC campus will also be impacted by the construction of Segments C and D of the
Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project (HHCTCP) in the Year 2015. Three
new structures are also projected to be constructed near the rail line which will follow
the median of Farrington Highway in the vicinity of LCC. The Transit Maintenance
Facility is slated to be constructed on the parcel of land west of Leeward Community
College. The LCC transit station is slated to be constructed on the western end of the
LCC campus, straddling Ala Ike Street. The Pearl Highlands transit station is projected to
be constructed just mauka of the Farrington Highway (WB) and Waiawa Drive
intersection. The bus pull-out that is currently on the makai side of Farrington Highway
(WB) will be moved to the mauka side and will form the fourth leg of the Farrington
Highway (WB) and Waiawa Drive intersection. This intersection will be signalized via
the HHCTCP by the year 2015. The County will signalize the Farrington Highway
(WB)/Waiawa Drive intersection as part of the Pearl Highlands transit station
construction.

The two movements that will be impacted most are the EB Ala Ike through-left
movement at the Ala Ike Street and Waiawa Drive intersection and the NB Ala Ike right
turn at the Farrington Highway (EB) and Ala Ike Street intersection. The EB through-left at
Ala Ike and Waiawa is projected to continue to operate at LOS F during the mid-day.
The NB right at Farrington Highway (EB) and Ala Ike will operate at LOS F, an increase
from LOS E in the existing conditions (Table 4-2).

The signalization at Farrington Highway (WB) and Waiawa Drive is anticipated to
greatly improve the operation of that intersection, particularly for the NB left turns from
Waiawa Drive.

Projected Year 2015 Conditions with Project

The number of new trips generated by the LCC EIIF are 17 during the AM peak hour, 15
during the midday peak hour, and 14 during the PM peak hour. As shown in Table 4-2,
traffic operations in horizon year 2015 are not significantly impacted by the LCC EIIF
development.

Traffic operations at the Ala Ike Street and Waiawa Drive intersection will operate
similarly to the year 2015 without Project scenario. The EB Ala Ike through-left
movement will continue to operate at excessive delay in the mid-day peak hour (LOS F).

The Farrington Highway (EB) and Waiawa Drive intersection will operate similarly as the
year 2015 without Project scenario. The LOS in the AM peak hour is anticipated to
remain at C, the mid-day peak hour is expected to be unchanged at LOS D, and the PM
peak hour LOS is expected to be unchanged at LOS B.

The Farrington Highway (WB) and Waiawa Drive intersection is also anticipated to
operate similarly as the year 2015 without Project scenario. The AM peak hour is
anticipated to operate at LOS A, the mid-day peak hour is anticipated to operate at LOS
B, and the PM peak hour is expected to operate at LOS A.

                            DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT



Construction activities may generate short-term traffic impacts to the motoring public,
bicyclists, students, faculty, staff, and visitors to LCC mostly in the immediate vicinity of
the LCC EIIF construction site. The campus has a long frontage to a large parking lot and
has many unobstructed points of entry. As such, mitigation measures will be
implemented to minimize construction-related traffic. When appropriate, construction
personnel or off-duty police will be required to direct and facilitate traffic during
construction activities.

The LCC EIIF project is not anticipated to have a significant long term impact on the
surrounding roadways. Construction activities at the EIIF site will occur during daylight
hours, but to the extent feasible, construction activities that may affect roadways are
planned to be restricted to avoid peak-hour traffic. Should the need to transport any
oversized equipment/overweight loads on State highway facilities, a DOT Highways
Division permit will be prepared.

Parking

No additional parking stalls are proposed as part of the construction of the EIIF project.
Currently, 1,642 standard parking stalls and 36 handicapped parking stalls are provided
on campus. Using the parking calculations based on the County's Land Use Ordinance,
Table 21-6.1, indicating the off-street parking requirement for Schools and Auditorium
uses. The new building will require 80 parking stalls, and the current requirement for the
existing facilities is 912 stalls. Therefore, the total required parking for the proposed
project and existing facilities is 992 stalls. The current surplus of parking spaces
sufficiently meets and exceeds the parking requirements for the proposed EIIF.

Current Public Transportation

TheBus, which is the public transportation service provided by the City and County of
Honolulu, provides various bus routes to and from the LCC campus. These routes
include:

No. 73 ­ This is a shuttle that connects the LCC campus with a bus stop along Farrington
Highway. (The bus stop along Farrington Highway is a 15-minute, uncovered walk from
the campus).

No. 42 ­ This bus route connects ÿEwa Beach with Waikïkï, with a stop along Farrington
Highway. Bus riders can either walk to the campus from the bus stop or ride (shuttle)
Bus No. 73.

                            DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

While a one-way fare is $2.00, monthly adult passes offering unlimited rides are
available for $40 a month. TheBus offers a reduced fare called the U-Pass for $100 per
semester.

Effective July 1, 2007, as the result of legislative action, the University has implemented a
Pre-Tax Bus Pass option for University employees. This program is authorized under
Section 132(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, known as the Transportation Equity Act for
the 21st Century. Eligible University employees living and working on the island of O`ahu
will be given the opportunity to purchase monthly bus passes through payroll deduction,
on a pre-tax basis, thereby saving on FICA, Federal and State income taxes.

Future Public Transportation

The County is planning for a high-capacity transit corridor project between the City of
Kapolei and the University of Hawaiÿi at Mänoa. The Honolulu High-Capacity Transit
Corridor Project (HHCTCP) has evaluated transit alternatives for the 23-mile long corridor
between Kapolei and UH Mänoa. On December 22, 2006, the City Council adopted Bill
79 (2006), CD2, FD2 (Ordinance 07-001) which selected the fixed guideway alternative
as the Locally Preferred Alternative (LPA). The LPA route travels between Kapolei and the
University of Hawaiÿi at Mänoa, starting at or near the intersection of Kapolei Parkway and
Kalaeloa Boulevard, down Saratoga Avenue to Kualakaÿi Parkway (green route) or along
Kamokila Boulevard (yellow route), as determined by the County administration before or
during preliminary engineering. The route then continues to Farrington Highway across
Ft. Weaver Road, to Kamehameha Highway to Salt Lake Boulevard and Aolele Street, as
determined by the County administration before or during preliminary engineering to
downtown Honolulu via Dillingham Boulevard. After leaving Dillingham Boulevard, the
alignment would continue along Nimitz Highway, Halekauwila Street and Kapiÿolani
Boulevard to UH Mänoa with a branch to Waikïkï. The County will now undertake
preliminary engineering and is in the process of finalizing the environmental impact
statement for the LPA. As the first project, the City Council selected a minimum operable
segment (MOS) that will begin near the Kroc Center on North-South Road to Farrington
Highway, through Waipahu, Pearl City (with a stop at the LCC campus), ÿAiea, and via
Salt Lake Boulevard through downtown Honolulu to Ala Moana Center. As of this writing,
we understand that the portion of the alignment between the Kroc Center and Waipahu,
the location of the transit maintenance and storage facility, and the location of potential
transit stations are being finalized.

The Fixed Guideway alignment that is adjacent to the LCC campus would be on elevated
structures. The fixed guideway could be as narrow as 25 feet wide. If the structures are
elevated, they would be supported by six foot wide columns and the structure could be
about 30 feet tall.

                            DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

At this time, no decision has been made regarding the technology that would be used for
the Fixed Guideway Alternative. This decision will be made at a later stage of project
development. The County is preparing a Final EIS and is in the process of requesting
approval from the Federal Transit Administration to begin preliminary engineering (project
design).

If a transit station is built on a portion of the LCC campus, this would provide greater
accessibility to the campus for those faculty, staff and students who rely on public
transportation, as the transit station will be closer to the campus than the existing bus stop
off-campus on Farrington Highway. Additionally, since the rail line will be elevated, there
will be conflicts with cars on roads and the travel time for users of the rail line will be on
schedule. The convenience of the rail transit may encourage ridership to/from the campus
and subsequently reduce the need for personal motorized vehicles, increase the safety of
students, faculty and staff and reduce the time for commuting. Additionally, the LCC
campus will enable East Kapolei, Waipahu, Pearl City and ÿAiea residents to attend an
institution of higher learning without commuting to Honolulu. Increased use of public
transportation means fewer residents driving their own vehicles and less traffic on
roadways.

4.3   NOISE

Existing noise levels at and immediately adjacent to the proposed site mimic those
typical of a campus parking lot. The project site is bordered on one side by the modular
buildings of the UH West Oÿahu campus. The windows of the UH West Oÿahu
buildings facing the project site are air conditioned.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Construction activities for the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will
inevitably create temporary noise impacts. The building contractor may employ
mitigation measures to minimize those temporary noise impacts including the use of
mufflers and implementing construction curfew periods. Pursuant to Chapter 11-46,
Hawaiÿi Administrative Rules, all project activities must comply with all community
noise controls.

Once in operation, the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will generate
noise consistent with classroom activity. Noise levels will elevate when classes change.
Because the surrounding buildings are fully enclosed and air-conditioned, the proposed
facility will not create noise impacts or noise-related disruption to students and staff
using these buildings. No mitigation measures are proposed as the noise generated as a
result of the proposed project represents no substantial change from current noise
occurrences.

4.4      AIR QUALITY

The State's good air quality is largely a function of the predominant tradewinds blowing
from the northeast. The typical tradewind pattern blows man-made and volcanic
pollutants out from metro Honolulu toward the ocean. However, during non-tradewind
periods, man-made and volcanic pollutants tend to accumulate on island impacting
visibility.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

LCC recognizes the potential for impacts to air quality during construction. This could
occur from additional traffic generated by construction vehicles, machinery, and dust
generated during demolition of existing parking pavement and excavation.

An effective dust control plan will be implemented as necessary. All construction
activities will comply with the provisions of Title 11, Chapter 59, HAR related to Ambient
Air Quality Standards and Section 11-60.1-33, HAR related to Fugitive Dust. Measures to
control dust during various phases of construction include:

          Providing an adequate water source at the site prior to start-up construction
          activities;
          Irrigating the construction site during periods of drought or high winds;
          Landscaping and rapid covering of bare areas, including slopes, starting from
          the initial grading phase;
          Disturbing only the areas of construction that are in the immediate zone of
          construction to limit the amount of time that the areas will be subject to
          erosion;
          Providing adequate dust control measures during weekends, after hours, and
          before daily start-up of construction activities; and
          Installing silt screening in the areas of disturbance.

In the long-term, the proposed project will likely not have an impact on air-quality in the
immediate vicinity.

4.5      VISUAL RESOURCES

The proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will be located near the
front of the LCC campus and nearby the tallest LCC campus building, the Campus
Theatre. The County's Central Oahu Sustainable Communities Plan does not recognize
any view planes encompassing the LCC site that requires consideration and
accommodation.

                             DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The dense nature of the LCC campus and the congruence of the proposed construction's
mass and height with those of surrounding buildings will not induce adverse impacts to
any recognized view planes. From the H-1 Freeway (north of the site), the Education
and Innovation Instructional Facility will be mostly obscured from views by the lower
elevation of the highway, as well as distance between the H-1 Freeway and the LCC
campus buildings. Similarly, from the south (makai) and west, existing structures will
mostly obscure the proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility building.
The proposed project will be most visible from the College Garden Apartments project,
which is located on the eastern border of the LCC property. The proposed project will
be setback approximately 250 feet from eastern property line. Most of the College
Garden Apartments are located on a terrace below the driveway to the University of
Hawaii at West Oahu portion of the greater LCC property. Only one end of one
building of the College Garden Apartment is "fully" is viewable from the project site, but
this side of the building has very small windows which appear to be in place for air
circulation purposes. In addition, the University's own design review process will help
ensure that the proposed building is architecturally compatible with surrounding
structures. Because no visually adverse impacts are expected, no additional mitigative
measures are proposed.

4.6     SOCIAL & ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS

According to the County's Central Oahu Sustainable Communities Plan (SCP) (2002),

      "Central Oahu plays a key role in implementing the directed growth policies of the
      General Plan of the City and County of Honolulu.

      The towns of Waipahu and Wahiawa serve as gateways to Ewa and the North
      Shore. Historically, they have been headquarters for the sugar and pineapple
      plantations and support centers for the military. Beginning in 1968, Central Oahu
      also began to play a role as a major area for housing development. At that time,
      Castle & Cooke began development of Mililani Town, a 3,500 acre planned low-
      density suburban community which offered affordable single family housing to first
      time buyers. Subsequently, additional housing has been developed above Waipahu
      and the H-1 Freeway in Village Park, Gentry Waipio, Waikele, Royal Kunia, and
      other development projects.

      In 1989, the Honolulu City Council approved changes to the General Plan which
      designated the urban fringe areas in Central Oahu as one of Oahu's principal
      residential development areas. Since then, Central Oahu, along with the Primary
      Urban Center (PUC) and the Secondary Urban Center and urban fringe areas in
      Ewa, has provided the bulk of the new housing developed on the island.

   ... In support of the General Plan policies, the Central Oahu Sustainable
   Communities Plan... Helps relieve urban development pressures on rural and
   urban fringe Sustainable Communities Plan Areas (Waianae, North Shore,
   Koolauloa, Koolaupoko, and East Honolulu) so as to preserve the "country" lifestyle
   of the rural areas and sustain the stable, low density residential character of the
   urban fringe areas.

The 2002 Central Oahu SCP was based on the 2000 Census. According to the 2000
Census, the population of the City and County of Honolulu numbered 876,156
individuals. The population, number of housing units and number of non-construction
jobs in Central Oÿahu and ÿEwa (the primary districts being served by the LCC campus) in
2000 was as follows:

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The 2002 Central Oahu SCP is in the process of being updated to accommodate a
planning horizon of the year 2030. The County Department of Planning and
Permitting's consultant, Belt Collins provided an overview of projections for the Central
Oÿahu     and     ÿEwa     Districts    to   the   year    2030     on     its    website

LCC does not anticipate hiring additional faculty or staff for the teaching education unit.
The demands of meeting the teaching needs will be handled in a variety of ways,
including collaboration with two-year and four-year educational institution partners and
increasing the number of courses offered through distance education.

The scope of the construction project will contribute positively to the construction
industry.

4.7     INFRASTRUCTURE AND UTILITIES

4.7.1      Water System

LCC is served by the City's Board of Water Supply (BWS) system. Water service is
provided by an eight-inch main that extends from the BWS Waipahu "228" System at the
intersection of Waipahu Street and Kahualena Street. Water pressures are governed by the
BWS Waipahu Reservoir which has a spillway elevation of 228 feet mean sea level (msl).
Two water meters located at the northwest corner of the LCC campus monitor the on-site
water consumption. The 1999 LRDP indicated that the existing water pressure is
insufficient. Since the report was prepared, two separate waterline improvement projects
were completed to address the insufficient water pressure/supply. One of the upgrades
included the installation of a 12-inch waterline throughout the campus, including a
waterline located directly to the north of the proposed EIIF project site.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The proposed domestic water connection will be made to the recently installed 12-inch
waterline that provides service to the campus.

During the pre-consultation process, the Board of Water Supply wrote "The existing
water system is presently adequate to accommodate the proposed development.
However, please be advised that this information is based upon current data and,
therefore, the Board of Water Supply reserves the right to change any position or
information stated herein up until the final approval of your building permit application.
The final decision on the availability of water will be confirmed when the building
permit application is submitted for approval." Close coordination will be maintained
with BWS to ensure that the water system will not be adversely impacted and to
minimize interruption of water services to adjacent areas. During the design phase, the
construction drawings will be submitted to the BWS for review and approval.

When water is made available, LCC will pay the BWS Water System Facilities Charges
for resource development, transmission and daily storage. BWS Cross-Connection
Control and Backflow Prevention requirements will be fulfilled prior to the issuance of

the building permit. On-site fire protection requirements will be coordinated with the
Fire Prevention Bureau of the Honolulu Fire Department.

4.7.2     Wastewater System
The campus' on-site sewer system is comprised of line sizes ranging between four (4) to
10-inches and extends to every building that requires service. An existing 10-inch sewer
line connects to the County Sewer system which terminates at the Pearl City Sewage
Pump Station. Wastewater generated at LCC is conveyed by a series of gravity lines,
pump stations, and force mains to the Honouliuli Wastewater Treatment Plant.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The proposed project is not anticipated to have any significant adverse impact on the
County's wastewater collection system. Wastewater service for the proposed project will
be connected to the existing wastewater collection system.

During the pre-consultation period, the County's Department of Design and
Construction wrote that a sewer connection application should be filed with the
Department of Planning and Permitting, Wastewater Branch, to determine adequacy of
existing sewer lines.

4.7.3     Drainage System

A network of drain inlets and pipes collects storm runoff from most of the campus and
directs the storm water to the southwest corner near the tennis courts. From there it
leaves the campus via a 48-inch drain pipe westward in a 15-foot drain easement
through the adjacent U.S. Government land. Approximately 500 feet beyond the school
boundary this off-site storm drain turns southward through private property and
ultimately discharges into Pearl Harbor Middle Loch.

There is an existing concrete-lined trapezoidal ditch running along the entire southern
boundary of the LCC campus. For the most part, the ditch slopes downhill from the
eastern end to the westward end with the low point occurring near the tennis courts.
The ditch intercepts surface runoff not collected by the on-site network of drain inlets
and drains. The lined ditch has inlets that are connected, via a 24-inch drain, to the 48-
inch off-site drain described above.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Traditionally, development of a new building would result in the increase of impervious
area of the project site, resulting in an increase in the volume of runoff. However, as
presently designed, the project will include a "green roof," an infiltration trench, and
detention basins which are likely to reduce the volume of runoff. Rainfall is being

proposed to be captured for reuse in irrigating project landscaping. The proposed
drainage system is designed to retain a volume of runoff for a certain storm event based
on City and County requirements. Any runoff in excess of that will be conveyed to the
existing drainage system. No significant impacts to the drainage patterns in the vicinity
of the project area are anticipated during construction of the proposed project.

Drainage improvements will be designed in accordance with County requirements for
storm capacity. During construction, potential surface runoff will be addressed in
accordance with the County grading ordinance. Following construction, exposed soils
will have been built over, paved over or landscaped to control erosion.

4.7.4     Electrical and Telecommunications Systems

Electrical
LCC is serviced with dual 12.47 kV feeders by the Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO).
HECO feeders terminate at LCC's primary service equipment located in the Air
Conditioning Cooling Tower Plant where they are primary metered.

The 12.47 kV power is distributed to transformer stations on the LCC campus through an
underground power raceway system which is owned and maintained by the State of
Hawaiÿi. The operating power to the buildings is delivered from existing indoor
switchgear (unit substation) consisting of two primary switches, an oil-filled, pad-mounted
transformer and a secondary distribution panel section.

The existing building switchgears have not been upgraded since their initial installation
and show typical signs of component degrading such as corrosion and mechanical
operation deficiency. There is also an outdoor rated transformer and secondary
switchboard that provides power to the UH-West Oÿahu campus buildings. The UH-West
Oÿahu outdoor transformer appears to be badly corroded and is due for replacement in the
short-term.

Telecommunications
LCC is served by Hawaiian Telcom for telephone service.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Electrical
The proposed project will utilize a new pad-mounted transformer to either upgrade or
replace the existing corroded pad-mounted transformer serving the UH-West Oÿahu
campus.

Development plans will show all affected HECO facilities, and address any conflicts
between the proposed plans and HECO's existing facilities. Pre-final development plans

will be forwarded to HECO for review. Should the relocation of or additional facilities be
required, a formal request will be submitted and coordinated through the appropriate
HECO department(s).

Telecommunications
The telecommunications distribution system for the EIIF project will consist of a
hierarchical star topology structured cable system (SCS) consistent with the SCS already
installed on the LCC campus. The proposed project is not anticipated to have any
significant adverse impact on existing electrical and telecommunications systems.

4.7.5       Solid Waste

No solid waste is being generated on the project site except for grass clippings during
lawn mowing or rubbish that might be discarded on portion of the site covering the
parking lot.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The proposed project will generate solid waste during construction. The contractor will
be required to dispose of all waste in compliance with the County's Department of
Environmental Management requirements.

The LCC will incorporate provisions for the Education and Innovation Instructional
Facility into the existing solid waste management plan. Solid waste disposal will be in
accordance with the guidelines set forth by the County's Department of Environmental
Services.

4.8     PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES

4.8.1       Police Protection

The site is located within Honolulu Police Department District 3. District 3 covers the
area from Red Hill to Village Park and Waipahu, which is a total area of approximately 66
square miles with a population of 160,000 (2000 census).

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

LCC does not anticipate that the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will create
an increased demand on existing police protection services. During the pre-consultation
period, the County's Police Department wrote that "This project should have no
significant impact on the facilities or operations of the Honolulu Police Department."

4.8.2     Fire Protection

The Pearl City, Waipahu, Waikele and Waiau Fire Stations are all located near the LCC
campus.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

LCC does not anticipate that the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will create
an increased demand on existing fire protection services. During the pre-consultation
period, the County's Fire Department commented that the project shall comply with the
following: 1) Provide a fire apparatus access road to within 150 feet of the first floor of
every facility or building constructed; 2) Provide a County-approved water supply capable
of supplying adequate flow for fire protection, with onsite fire hydrants provided if facility
or building is over 150 feet from the fire access road and water supply; and 3) Submit civil
and construction drawings to HFD for review and approval. The proposed project is
located adjacent to the main campus parking lot and will be accessible to fire trucks.

4.8.3     Health Care Services

Health care facilities that provide emergency services, located near the Education and
Innovation Instructional Facility, include Hawaiÿi Medical Center West in ÿEwa and
Kapiÿolani Pali Momi Medical Center in ÿAiea. A variety of health care providers can be
found nearby in Waipahu and Pearl City.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Although there may be an unavoidable and occasional need for emergency health care
services by students or employees of the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility;
the project is not expected to significantly increase the need for emergency service, and is
not expected to have a long-term adverse impact on emergency medical providers or their
ability to service the community.

4.8.4     Recreational Facilities

Recreational facilities near the LCC campus include on-campus recreational opportunities,
as well as nearby facilities such as Lehua Community Park, Sunset Memorial Park,
Waipahu District Park, Hans L'Orange Park, Pacheco Playground and Manana
Community Park.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The use is not anticipated to displace any existing or create any additional demand on
recreational facilities in the vicinity of the project. During the pre-consultation period, the

                            DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

County's Department of Parks and Recreation wrote that "...the proposed project will not
impact any program or facility of the department."

4.8.5     Schools

The LCC campus is located in Central Oÿahu, between Waipahu and Pearl City. The
proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will be located makai of the
large parking lot, in an area next to the Theatre Plaza on the LCC campus.

A number of public and private elementary, middle and high schools are located in the
vicinity of the LCC campus including Lanakila Baptist Elementary School, August Ahrens
Elementary School, St. Joseph Elementary School, Lehua Elementary School, Pearl City
Elementary School, Waipahu Intermediate School, Waipahu High School.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The project will directly benefit LCC by providing additional facilities and classrooms for
its Social Science Division. Currently, the department's offices and classes are dispersed
throughout the entire LCC campus. The proposed project will provide a single facility for
the SSD, enhancing operational efficiency and improving the learning environment. The
proposed EIIF project will provide spaces to support the functions and needs for SSD
programs, including American Studies, Anthropology, Economics, Geography, Political
Science, Psychology, Sociology, Social Sciences, Women's Studies, Interdisciplinary
Studies, Human Services and Law. The Teacher Training program will be also facilitated
in the proposed EIIF building.

Because no residential development is involved with the project, no increases in public
school enrollments will occur. Community colleges in general, provide a less
intimidating and less expensive alternative to four-year campuses to ensure that high
school graduates and adults further their education.

                        5.0    LAND USE CONFORMANCE

State and County land use plans and policies and required permits and approvals relevant
to the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility are described below.

5.1   STATE OF HAWAIÿI

5.1.1      State Land Use Law, Chapter 205, Hawaiÿi Revised Statutes
The State Land Use Law (Chapter 205, HRS), establishes the State Land Use Commission
(LUC) and authorizes this body to designate all lands in the State into one of four districts:
Urban, Rural, Agricultural, or Conservation. These districts are defined and mapped by
the State Land Use Commission in order to ensure compatibility with neighboring land
uses and protection of public health.

The proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility is located within the State
Urban District (Figure 10).

5.1.2      Coastal Zone Management Act, Chapter 205A, Hawaiÿi Revised Statutes
The Coastal Zone Management Area, as defined in Chapter 205A, HRS, includes all the
lands of the State. Therefore, the proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility
lies within the Coastal Zone Management Area.

The Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program aims to provide recreational opportunities,
protect historic resources, protect scenic and open space resources, protect coastal
ecosystems, provide facilities for economic development, reduce hazards, and manage
development. Program objectives and applicability to the proposed Education and
Innovation Instructional Facility are discussed below:

RECREATIONAL RESOURCES

Objective: Provide coastal recreational opportunities accessible to the public.

Policy A: Improve coordination and funding of coastal recreational planning and
          management; and

Policy B: Provide adequate, accessible, and diverse recreational opportunities in the
          coastal zone management area by:
          (i) Protecting coastal resources uniquely suited for recreational activities
               that cannot be provided in other areas;
          (ii) Requiring replacement of coastal resources having significant
               recreational value, including but not limited to surfing sites, fishponds,
               and sand beaches, when such resources will be unavoidably damaged

                   by development; or requiring reasonable monetary compensation to
                   the State for recreation when replacement is not feasible or desirable;
          (iii)    Providing and managing adequate public access, consistent with
                   conservation of natural resources, to and along shorelines with
                   recreational value;
          (iv)     Providing an adequate supply of shoreline parks and other recreational
                   facilities suitable for public recreation;
          (v)      Ensuring public recreational uses of County, State, and Federally
                   owned or controlled shoreline lands and waters having recreational
                   value consistent with public safety standards and conservation of
                   natural resources;
          (vi)     Adopting water quality standards and regulating point and nonpoint
                   sources of pollution to protect, and where feasible, restore the
                   recreational value of coastal waters;
          (vii)    Developing new shoreline recreational opportunities, where
                   appropriate, such as artificial lagoons, artificial beaches, and artificial
                   reefs for surfing and fishing; and
          (viii)   Encouraging reasonable dedication of shoreline areas with recreational
                   value for public use as part of discretionary approvals or permits by the
                   land use commission, board of land and natural resources, and County
                   authorities; and crediting such dedication against the requirements of
                   section 46-6.

Discussion: The proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will be located
inland, away from the shoreline; therefore, it is anticipated that there will be no direct
effect on existing coastal or inland recreational resources. According to the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) website, unlike pollution from industrial and sewage treatment
plants, non-point source (NPS) pollution comes from many diffuse sources. "NPS
pollution is caused by rainfall or snowmelt moving over and through the ground. As the
runoff moves, it picks up and carries away natural and human-made pollutants, finally
depositing them into lakes, rivers, wetlands, coastal waters, and even our underground
sources of drinking water. These pollutants include:
      Excess fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides from agricultural lands and
      residential areas;

      Oil, grease, and toxic chemicals from urban runoff and energy production;

      Sediment from improperly managed construction sites, crop and forest lands,
      and eroding streambanks;

      Salt from irrigation practices and acid drainage from abandoned mines;

      Bacteria and nutrients from livestock, pet wastes, and faulty septicsystems;

Atmospheric deposition and hydromodification are also sources of nonpoint source
pollution."

Of the above, the construction of the proposed project could pose the potential for
sediment from improperly managed construction sites, however, the establishment and
implementation of best management practices (BMPs) during construction will reduce
wind- and water-borne soil erosion. This will include watering of exposed soils during
earthmoving, and providing silt traps downslope of the construction site.

The BMPs will be implemented to prevent pollution and protect the environment.
Temporary erosion control measures will be installed prior to any clearing, demolition
and/or construction activities. Structure BMPs include silt fence at the downstream
perimeter of the project site, sediment control filters at drain inlets, stabilized construction
ingress/egress, and concrete truck was pad. An erosion and sedimentation control (ESC)
plan was prepared to address all construction activities.

During the operation of the project, there is also the potential for excess fertilizers,
herbicides, and insecticides from the landscaped portions of the proposed project running
off the site during a storm event. However, LCC has existing detention basins that
moderate the amount of runoff.

HISTORIC RESOURCES

Objective: Protect, preserve and, where desirable, restore those natural and manmade
historic and prehistoric resources in the coastal zone management area that are significant
in Hawaiian and American history and culture.

Policy A: Identify and analyze significant archaeological resources;

Policy B: Maximize information retention through preservation of remains and
          artifacts or salvage operations; and

Policy C: Support State goals for protection, restoration, interpretation, and display of
          historic resources.

Discussion: Due to the extensive disturbance the proposed Education and Innovation
Instructional Facility site has experienced for development of the existing campus, it is
unlikely that subsurface historic resources are present. Should any archaeological or
cultural remains be encountered during construction, all work in the immediate vicinity of
the find will cease and the State Historic Preservation Division will be contacted for
establishment of appropriate mitigation in accordance with Chapter 6E, Hawaiÿi Revised
Statutes.

                            DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

SCENIC AND OPEN SPACE RESOURCES

Objective: Protect, preserve and, where desirable, restore or improve the quality of coastal
scenic and open space resources.

Policy A: Identify valued scenic resources in the coastal zone management area;

Policy B: Ensure that new developments are compatible with their visual environment
          by designing and locating such developments to minimize the alteration of
          natural landforms and existing public views to and along the shoreline;

Policy C: Preserve, maintain, and, where desirable, improve and restore shoreline
          open space and scenic resources; and

Policy D: Encourage those developments which are not coastal dependent to locate in
          inland areas.

Discussion: The proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will be located
inland, away from the shoreline; therefore, it is anticipated that there will be no effect on
the quality of the coastal scenic resources. In addition, the proposed facility will be
located mauka of existing LCC buildings, and will likely be screened from view from the
shoreline.

COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS

Objective: Protect valuable coastal ecosystems, including reefs, from disruption and
minimize adverse impacts on all coastal ecosystems.

Policy A: Exercise an overall conservation ethic, and practice stewardship in the
          protection, use, and development of marine and coastal resources;

Policy B: Improve the technical basis for natural resource management;

Policy C: Preserve valuable coastal ecosystems, including reefs, of significant
          biological or economic importance;

Policy D: Minimize disruption or degradation of coastal water ecosystems by effective
          regulation of stream diversions, channelization, and similar land and water
          uses, recognizing competing water needs; and

Policy E: Promote water quantity and quality planning and management practices that
          reflect the tolerance of fresh water and marine ecosystems and maintain and

          enhance water quality through the development and implementation of
          point and nonpoint source water pollution control measures.

Discussion: Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be employed during construction to
reduce the erosion of soils and fugitive dust during construction. Controlling runoff
particularly will ensure that the construction will not increase inputs of sediment into
Waiawa Stream.

ECONOMIC USES

Objective: Provide public or private facilities and improvements important to the State's
economy in suitable locations.

Policy A: Concentrate coastal dependent development in appropriate areas;

Policy B: Ensure that coastal dependent development such as harbors and ports, and
          coastal related development such as visitor industry facilities and energy
          generating facilities, are located, designed, and constructed to minimize
          adverse social, visual, and environmental impacts in the coastal zone
          management area; and

Policy C: Direct the location and expansion of coastal dependent developments to
          areas presently designated and used for such developments and permit
          reasonable long-term growth at such areas, and permit coastal dependent
          development outside of presently designated areas when:
          (i) Use of presently designated locations is not feasible;
          (ii) Adverse environmental effects are minimized; and
          (iii) The development is important to the State's economy.

Discussion: The proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will contribute
to Hawaiÿi's economy through promotion of the Supportive Teacher Education Program
(STEP). The STEP is not dependant on coastal resources and is located away from the
shoreline makai of and on property separate from the campus.

COASTAL HAZARDS

Objective: Reduce hazard to life and property from tsunami, storm waves, stream
flooding, erosion, subsidence, and pollution.

Policy A: Develop and communicate adequate information about storm wave,
          tsunami, flood, erosion, subsidence, and point and non-point source
          pollution hazards;

                            DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Policy B: Control development in areas subject to storm wave, tsunami, flood,
          erosion, hurricane, wind, subsidence, and point and non-point source
          pollution hazards;

Policy C: Ensure that developments comply with requirements of the Federal Flood
          Insurance Program; and

Policy D: Prevent coastal flooding from inland projects.

Discussion: The proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility location inland
from and above the coastline virtually negates any potential hazard from tsunami, storm
waves, stream flooding. The measures to mitigate or negate the impacts from the
construction and operation of the proposed project on pollution of the nearshore
environment were previously described.

MANAGING DEVELOPMENT

Objective: Improve the development review process, communication, and public
participation in the management of coastal resources and hazards.

Policy A: Use, implement, and enforce existing law effectively to the maximum extent
          possible in managing present and future coastal zone development;

Policy B: Facilitate timely processing of applications for development permits and
          resolve overlapping or conflicting permit requirements; and

Policy C: Communicate the potential short and long-term impacts of proposed
          significant coastal developments early in their life cycle and in terms
          understandable to the public to facilitate public participation in the planning
          and review process.

Discussion: Due to the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility's inland location
from the shoreline, it should not be considered a "significant coastal development." Its
benign location relative to the coastline should not require an involved public
participation process concerning coastal effects, although this EA provides an opportunity
for input.

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

Objective: Stimulate public awareness, education, and participation in coastal
management.

Policy A: Promote public involvement in coastal zone management processes;

                           DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT



Policy B: Disseminate information on coastal management issues by means of
          educational materials, published reports, staff contact, and public
          workshops for persons and organizations concerned with coastal issues,
          developments, and government activities; and

Policy C: Organize workshops, policy dialogues, and site- specific mediations to
          respond to coastal issues and conflicts.

Discussion: Due to the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility's inland location
from the shoreline, it should not be considered a "significant coastal development." Its
benign location relative to the coastline should not require an involved public
participation process concerning coastal effects, although this EA provides an opportunity
for input.

BEACH PROTECTION

Objective: Protect beaches for public use and recreation.

Policy A: Locate new structures inland from the shoreline setback to conserve open
          space, minimize interference with natural shoreline processes, and
          minimize loss of improvements due to erosion;

Policy B: Prohibit construction of private erosion-protection structures seaward of the
          shoreline, except when they result in improved aesthetic and engineering
          solutions to erosion at the sites and do not interfere with existing
          recreational and waterline activities; and

Policy C: Minimize the construction of public erosion-protection structures seaward of
          the shoreline.

Discussion: The proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will be located
inland from the ocean. The proposed project will not require the construction of erosion-
protection structures seaward of the shoreline.

MARINE RESOURCES

Objective: Promote the protection, use, and development of marine and coastal resources
to assure their sustainability.

Policy A: Ensure that the use and development of marine and coastal resources are
          ecologically and environmentally sound and economically beneficial;

                            DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Policy B: Coordinate the management of marine and coastal resources and activities
          to improve effectiveness and efficiency;

Policy C: Assert and articulate the interests of the State as a partner with Federal
          agencies in the sound management of ocean resources within the United
          States exclusive economic zone;

Policy D: Promote research, study, and understanding of ocean processes, marine life,
          and other ocean resources in order to acquire and inventory information
          necessary to understand how ocean development activities relate to and
          impact upon ocean and coastal resources; and

Policy E: Encourage research and development of new, innovative technologies for
          exploring, using, or protecting marine and coastal resources.

Discussion: The proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will be located
inland, away from the shoreline; therefore, it is anticipated that there will be no direct
effect on existing coastal marine resources.

5.1.3      Hawaiÿi State Planning Act, Chapter 226, Hawaiÿi Revised Statutes
The Hawaiÿi State Plan, Chapter 226 HRS (2007) provides guidelines for the future
growth of the State of Hawaiÿi. The Hawaiÿi State Plan identifies goals, objectives,
policies, and priorities for allocating the State's resources, including public funds,
services, human resources, land, energy, and water. The plan was enacted to achieve "a
desired physical environment, characterized by beauty, cleanliness, quiet, stable natural
systems, and uniqueness, that enhances the mental and physical well-being of the
people." Chapter 226 HRS (2007).

Discussion: Planning objectives outlined in Chapter 226 support the expansion of the
Education and Innovation Instructional Facility. Section 226-21 relating to education
states that it shall be the policy of the State to "...ensure the provision of adequate and
accessible educational services and facilities that are designed to meet individual and
community needs." As noted elsewhere, Hawaiÿi continues to have a critical shortage of
trained teachers within the public school system. Research indicates that teacher quality
is one of the most influential factors in student achievement. The mission of the LCC
Supportive Teacher Education Program (STEP) is to recruit and support local students into
becoming highly qualified teachers in their own communities.

5.2     CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU

5.2.1     General Plan
The City and County of Honolulu's General Plan is the policy document for the long-
range development of the Island of Oÿahu. The General Plan is a statement of general
conditions to be sought in the 20 year planning horizon and policies to help direct
attainment of the plan's objectives.

Specific General Plan goals and policies applicable to the proposed Education and
Innovation Instructional Facility project are discussed below.

Health and Education

      Objective B ­ To provide a wide range of educational opportunities for the
        people of Oahu.
        Policies
                (1) Support education programs that encourage the development of
                     employable skills.

      Objective C ­ To make Honolulu the center of higher education in the Pacific.
        Policies
                (1) Encourage continuing improvement in the quality of higher
                      education in Hawaii.

Discussion: As previously noted, STEP is a teacher preparation program that supports
students who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary, secondary, and/or special
education. The STEP program prepares students to successfully achieve the Associate in
Arts in Teaching (AAT) degree and provides a solid foundation for those students
interested in pursuing a baccalaureate degree in Education.


5.2.2       Central Oahu Sustainable Communities Plan

The City and County of Honolulu has adopted the Central Oahu Sustainable
Communities Plan (SCP) as one of eight community-oriented plans to guide public
policy, investment and decision making through the 2025 planning horizon. The
document contains policies specific to Honolulu's primary urban center. These policies
are then implemented through ordinances such as the Land Use Ordinance (zoning
code).

Besides denoting LCC on the Central Oahu SCP Urban Land Use and Public Facilities
maps (Figure 11), the SCP makes the following references to the Leeward Community
College:

   Bike Paths. As part of the Pearl Harbor Historic Trail, a major bike path should run
   east-west along the OR&L right-of-way (with branch routes to the Waipahu Cultural
   Garden and Leeward Community College)...

   Other existing community facilities shown on the Urban Land Use Map in
   Appendix A include hospitals, colleges, correctional facilities, and cemeteries. Key
   facilities include Leeward Community College, Wahiawa Hospital, and the
   Waiawa Correctional Facility...

Discussion: The proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility is not
inconsistent with the above references to LCC in the Central Oahu SCP.


5.2.3     Land Use Ordinance

The Land Use Ordinance (LUO), Chapter 21 of the Revised Ordinance of Honolulu,
implements the goals and objectives of the General Plan and the Central Oahu SCP. All
lands within the City and County of Honolulu are zoned into specific districts. According
to the Department of Planning and Permitting, the project site is zoned Agricultural (AG-2)
(Figure 12).

According to the LUO Master Use Table (Table 21-3), universities and colleges are
permitted in all zoning districts regulated by the City and County of Honolulu with Plan
Review Use (PRU) approval.

Discussion: The proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility is consistent
with the LUO in that it is part of a long-established college campus (since 1969). LCC is
currently operating under Plan Review Use (PRU) Permit No.1999/PRU-1 (Resolution
No. 99-359, CD-1), approved on March 15, 2000, for the "Thirty-Year Master Plan To
Allow the Construction of New School Facilities, Expansion and Interior Renovations to
Existing Buildings, and Upgrading of Infrastructure Improvements." The Leeward
Community College Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) was attached to PRU No.
1999/PRU-1, which was approved by Resolution 99-359, CD-1 (Appendix B). In the
LRDP, the site for the proposed project was to be occupied by the "Business
Ed./Language Arts" building. The New Education and Innovation Instructional Facility is
identified as the "Social Science" building in the 1999 LRDP. In discussions with the
County's Department of Planning and Permitting (DPP), it was determined that the
proposed project is different from the 1999 version of the LRDP, and that a minor
modification would need to be made to the existing PRU permit (Resolution No. 99-359,
CD-2).

                             6.0       ALTERNATIVES
In compliance with the provisions of Section 11-200-17(f), HAR relating to
Environmental Impact Statements, an environmental assessment must discuss potential
alternatives to the proposed action.

The alternatives considered include:

6.1   NO ACTION

The no-action alternative is no change to the existing site. Under this alternative the
proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will not be constructed. This
would be inconsistent with LCC's 1999 Long Range Development Plan which identifies
the project site for siting of a new LCC instructional facility. Without the proposed
project, Hawaiÿi will continue to have a critical shortage of trained teachers within the
public school system.

6.2   ALTERNATIVES

In order to accommodate the proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility,
several sites were studied within the existing LCC campus. The sites studied, include: the
Continuining Education and Workforce Development (CE) complex in the northeast
corner of the campus property, and the UH West Oÿahu complex on the eastern edge of
the built campus. The CE complex site was rejected as it is near the HHCTC alignment
and proposed LCC Transit Station site. The UH West Oÿahu complex site was also
rejected because the timing of the development of the permanent UH West Oÿahu
campus in East Kapolei is currently uncertain.

Another alternative would be to move the Education and Innovation Instructional
Facility off-campus. However, this alternative was rejected because it would be
financially prohibitive due to the expensive land prices on Oÿahu.

These alternatives, as well as the No Action alternative discussed in Section 6.1, above
are considered at a minimum, inconsistent with the campus' long range development
plan, and are considered not feasible if the LCC is to follow its "30-year" LRDP.

      7.0   FINDINGS, SUPPORTING REASONS, AND ANTICIPATED
                          DETERMINATION

To determine whether the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility may have a
significant impact on the physical and human environment, all phases and expected
consequences of the proposed project have been evaluated, including potential primary,
secondary, short-range, long-range, and cumulative impacts. Based on this evaluation,
the Approving Agency (University of Hawaiÿi System, Office of Capital Improvements) is
anticipated to issue a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for the Education and
Innovation Instructional Facility. The supporting rationale for this anticipated finding is
presented in this chapter.

7.1   PROBABLE IMPACT, INCLUDING CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Cumulative impacts are impacts on the environment that result from the action when
added to other past, present, and foreseeable future actions by other agencies or persons.
As discussed throughout this document, in 1999, the University prepared a Long Range
Development Plan (LRDP) that was to guide campus development over 30 years (ending
year 2029). Assumed cumulative impacts could be those related to increased traffic and
greater demand on water, sanitary sewer and storm drainage capacity.

Subsequent to the approval of the 1999 LRDP, on June 26, 2006, Governor Lingle signed
HB2175, thus requiring each State agency to design and construct buildings to meet the
LEED Silver certified level, or a comparable standard. The law applies to all new State-
owned construction of 5,000 square feet or greater, including K-12 public schools. As a
result, the design of all new University buildings must include resource conservation
through energy efficiency, water conservation, recycling and other environmentally
sensible practices. Ostensibly, the University's sustainability initiatives will result in
making new buildings more efficient, improving stormwater conveyance practices and
encouraging alternative transportation. In addition, all new buildings are subject to an
Environmental Assessment and the development of the projects will include appropriate
mitigation measures to address any impacts. Regarding the exact sustainable design
features of the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility, the design of the project is
in its formative stage and various energy- and water-saving technologies are being
contemplated and compared.

Based on the fact that it is now LCC's additional initiative to replace and renovate
existing structures using environmentally sensible design and construction, it is assumed
that the cumulative impacts from the proposed Education and Innovation Instructional
Facility will be minimal.

                            DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Social-economic impacts resulting from the proposed LCC projects are anticipated to be
beneficial. Construction generates employment and economic opportunities. Expansion
of the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility center will allow the University of
Hawaiÿi to continue to provide training for future educators. Overall, the net cumulative
impact is expected to have a positive effect on future educators, and consequently,
kindergarten to high school students.

As previously mentioned, the HHCTC Fixed Guideway alignment is sited through the LCC
campus, as well as a transit station.

If a transit station is built on a portion of the LCC campus, this would provide greater
accessibility to the campus for those faculty, staff and students who rely on public
transportation, as the transit station will be closer to the campus than the existing bus stop
off-campus on Farrington Highway. Additionally, since the rail line will be elevated, there
will be no conflicts with cars on roads and the travel time for users of the rail line will be
on schedule. The convenience of the rail transit may encourage ridership to/from the
campus and subsequently reduce the need for personal motorized vehicles, increase the
safety of students, faculty and staff and reduce the time for commuting. Additionally, the
LCC campus will enable East Kapolei, Waipahu, Pearl City and ÿAiea residents to attend
an institution of higher learning without commuting to Honolulu. Increased use of public
transportation means fewer residents driving their own vehicles and less traffic on
roadways. This would be supportive of the University's sustainability initiatives.

7.2   SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA

Based upon the previous information presented in this document the proposed
permitting and construction of the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will
likely have no significant environmental impacts. This determination is based upon the
Significance Criteria outlined in Chapter 343, HRS, as amended and Title 11 Chapter
200 HAR 1996, discussed below.

(1)    Involves an irrevocable commitment to loss or destruction of any natural or
       cultural resource;

The site's status as an existing paved and landscaped area, plus prior land disturbance
suggests that the site is absent any resources potentially subject to irrevocable loss as a
result of construction. While there will be a temporary loss of lawn area, currently the
project is being planned with a "green roof."

(2)    Curtails the range of beneficial uses of the environment;

The Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will not curtail the range of
beneficial uses of the environment as the site is currently developed.

                            DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

(3)   Conflicts with the State's long term environmental policies or goals and
      guidelines as expressed in Chapter 344, HRS; and any revisions thereof and
      amendments thereto, court decisions, or executive orders;

The Environmental Policies enumerated in Chapter 344, HRS promote conservation of
natural resources, and an enhanced quality of life for all citizens. The proposed
Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will not significantly impact natural
resources due to the fact that the site is already developed with a sidewalk and a grassed
lawn.

(4)   Substantially affects the economic or social welfare of the community or State;

The Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will positively influence social
welfare by facilitating the training of teachers and teachers' aides.

(5)   Substantially affects public health;

The potential impacts related to noise, air or water quality during construction will be
addressed through construction management practices in compliance with Federal, State
and County requirements. LCC's initiative to build sustainably will help to ensure that
the proposed Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will not negatively affect
public health.

(6)   Involves substantial secondary impacts, such as population changes or effects on
      public facilities;

LCC anticipates no increase in student population as a result of the proposed Education
and Innovation Instructional Facility. The future classrooms to accommodate STEP are
proposed to address needs at the current and planned enrollment levels. The Innovation
Instruction Center is intended to support a learner-centered culture which will help
students persist and succeed in their postsecondary careers. In the UHCC system, 62% of
new students place into remedial/developmental writing courses and 81% of new students
place into remedial/developmental math courses.

The Student Resource Center would include state-of-the-art materials and resources
(books, computers, equipment, supplies, etc.) available for use by students and faculty to
enhance their instructional needs. The space would include a variety of individual and
group study/work configuration spaces and would promote the use of various forms of
activities and research required by students to present any kind of activity in a K-12
classroom.

One of the most pressing LCC campus space requirements is the need to schedule large
classes or groups (internal or external to the campus). Two (2) lecture halls are proposed,

one with a seating capacity of up to 100 students and one with a seating capacity of 50
students. Ideally, these spaces could also be combined in order to accommodate up to
150 students or guests to a class/meeting.

(7)    Involves a substantial degradation of environmental quality;

No substantial environmental degradation is anticipated. LCC has committed itself to a
development initiative of environmental sustainability. The project will need to meet
minimum applicable statutes and regulations as well as the more stringent self imposed
sustainability requirements.

(8)    Is individually limited but cumulatively has considerable effect on the
       environment, or involves a commitment for larger actions;

The proposed action will not have any substantial negative secondary impacts on the
environment. Implementation of the proposed project will not commit the University or
the City and County of Honolulu public facilities to any other larger actions, and will not
generate any additional actions having a cumulative effect on the environment.

(9)    Substantially affects a rare, threatened or endangered species or its habitat;

The Education and Innovation Instructional Facility will occupy a site that is already
committed to a portion of an existing paved parking lot and a grassed lawn. The site
contains no habitat for rare, threatened or endangered plant or animal species.

(10)   Detrimentally affects air or water quality or ambient noise levels;

Air Quality: No State or Federal air quality standards will be violated during or after the
construction of Education and Innovation Instructional Facility.

Water Quality: No State or Federal water quality standards will be violated during or
after the construction of Education and Innovation Instructional Facility.

Ambient Noise Levels: Construction activities for the development of the property will
inevitably create temporary noise impacts. The developer may employ mitigation
measures to minimize those temporary noise impacts including the use of mufflers and
implementing construction curfew periods. Pursuant to Chapter 11-46, Hawaiÿi
Administrative Rules, the project activities will comply with all community noise
controls.

(11)   Affects or is likely to suffer damage by being located in an environmentally
       sensitive area, such as a flood plain, tsunami zone, beach, erosion-prone area,
       geologically hazardous land, estuary, fresh water, or coastal waters;

                            DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT



The project site does not lie in an environmentally sensitive area such as a flood plain,
tsunami zone, beach, erosion-prone area, estuary, freshwater or coastal waters.
Likewise, the Education and Innovation Instructional Facility is not anticipated to have
any impact on any natural hazard conditions and no mitigative measures are planned.

(12)    Substantially affects scenic vistas and view planes identified in County or State
        plans or studies; or,

Adverse affects to mauka views will not occur due to the surrounding built environment
(the existing buildings of the LCC campus).

(13)    Requires substantial energy consumption.

The proposed project will not require substantial energy consumption. As mentioned
above, energy saving design elements will be integrated into building design.

7.3    ANTICIPATED DETERMINATION

On the basis of impacts and mitigation measures examined in this document and analyzed
under the above criteria, it is anticipated that the Education and Innovation Instructional
Facility will not have a significant effect on the physical or human environments.
Pursuant to Chapter 343, HRS, the approving agency, the University of Hawaiÿi System,
Office of Capital Improvements, will have to make a determination on a Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) or whether an Environmental Impact Statement is warranted.

Dear Ms. McMahon:

Thank you for your letter dated May 7, 2009. We acknowledge your assessment
that SHPD will likely concur with any finding of "no historic properties affected"
when the DEA (Draft EA) is developed. Also, in the event that historic resources
are discovered, including human skeletal remains, during project construction, all
work will cease in the immediate vicinity of the find, the find will be protected
from additional disturbance and the State Historic Preservation Division will be
contacted.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Leeward Community College "Educational and Innovation Instructional Facility (LCC
EIIF): A Learning Community" is planned to be constructed on the eastern end of the
current Leeward Community College campus by the year 2015 as shown in Figure 1. The
LCC EIIF will be located where currently the University of Hawaii, West Oahu (UHWO)
campus has its portable facilities. These facilities are scheduled to be removed by the
groundbreaking for the LCC EIIF as UHWO will move to its new location in East Kapolei.

Figure 2 shows the site plan. The new educational facility will be connected to LCC's
Theater Plaza via a newly constructed staircase. The new facility will also be connected to
the eastern portion of LCC's parking lot via a pedestrian bridge.      A pedestrian path,
running west-to-east, will connect to the rest of the campus.        Along this pathway,
bioretention basins will be utilized.    A green roof is also planned as part of an
environmentally-conscious design strategy.

The LCC EIIF will host over 18,328 square feet of space: 2,042 square feet will be
dedicated to a Teacher Education Office Suite; 2,094 square feet to a Teacher
Education/Home Away from Home space, including a case study/seminar room and a
classroom; 9,925 square feet to Common and Shared Spaces, including a conference
room, student resource center, and approximately nine classrooms; and 4,265 square feet
to non-assignable spaces, including: restrooms, stairwells, lobby areas, janitorial
maintenance rooms, etc.

II. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A. Existing Land Use

Leeward Community College currently sits on a parcel of land just makai of the Waiawa
Freeway Interchange which accommodates the H-1 Freeway, H-2 Freeway, Farrington
Highway and Kamehameha Highway. Much of the surrounding land is State of Hawaii
Department of Transportation Right-of-Way and is designated by the City as an AG-2
Agriculture ­ General use.

There is a small cluster of homes in-between Farrington Highway and Kamehameha
Highway known as the "banana patch" and this area is designated as R-5 (Residential)
use.

Adjacent to Waiawa Drive (to the east), in-between Farrington Highway west-bound (WB)
and Farrington Highway is the Benjamin "Ben" Saguibo Laborers' Apprenticeship &
Training Center. This facility is on an I-2 Industrial intensive use-designated parcel.

East of Leeward Community College, on Kamehameha Highway, business uses begin to
abound along the Kamehameha Highway corridor in Pearl City.              The Pearl Highlands
Shopping Center, just West of Acacia Road, is in a B-2 (Business ­ Community) land use
district.   Home Depot, just mauka of the shopping center, is in an IMX-1 (Industrial-
Commercial Mixed Use) land use district. The Wal-Mart and additional shopping center
areas mauka of the Pearl Highlands Shopping Center are also in an IMX-1 district.

B. Existing Roadway Network

LCC has no direct access to H-1 Freeway, H-2 Freeway, or Kamehameha Highway. The
following is a breakdown of the roadways most pertinent to the project site:

Farrington Highway is a State Principal Arterial Highway that connects Central Oahu to
West Oahu. The division and grade separation of the divided highway is quite pronounced
in the vicinity of LCC.   Farrington Highway connects to Kamehameha Highway in the
vicinity of Pearl Highlands Shopping Center. The posted speed limit on the WB side is 35
mph and 30 mph on the east-bound (EB) side in the vicinity of LCC. Farrington Highway
(WB) and Waiawa Drive form a stop-controlled intersection and Farrington Highway (EB)
and Waiawa Drive form a signalized intersection.

Ala Ike Street is the two-lane local road that provides the sole access to the LCC campus.
Ala Ike Street acts as a spine that collects vehicles from LCC's parking lot. Ala Ike Street
runs in an west-east orientation, running parallel with the H-1 Freeway and then connecting
the residential neighborhood east and makai of LCC to the Waiawa Drive Overpass. Ala
Ike Street has curb and gutter and sidewalk improvements on its western and curb and
gutter for half of its length on the eastern side. It ends in a cul-de-sac roughly 720 feet
makai of the Waiawa Drive Overpass. Two AC pavement, unstriped, single lane roads
radiate off of the cul-de-sac and lead to further residential areas. The western leg that
projects from the cul-de-sac carries west-bound and defines the makai border of LCC.
However, there does not appear to be any connectivity to LCC via this makai portion of
roadway. No speed limit signs are posted on Ala Ike Street.

Waiawa Drive is a two-lane collector road that provides access over the H-1 Freeway via
the Waiawa Drive Overpass which emanates from a T-intersection with Ala Ike Street and
heads mauka of the LCC campus. The EB and WB approaches of Ala Ike Street are stop-
controlled at this T-intersection. At its mauka terminus, Waiawa Drive forms two separate
intersections with Farrington Highway (approximately 220 feet apart).         The makai-most
intersection provides access to Farrington Highway EB and is signalized. The mauka-most
intersection provides access to Farrington Highway WB with the NB Waiawa Drive
approach being stop-controlled. The posted speed limit on Waiawa Drive is 25 mph.

Figure 3 illustrates the lane configurations and control types of the three intersections in the
vicinity of LCC.

 LCC EIIF TIAR
C. Existing Traffic Volumes

Turning movement counts were recorded at the three intersections in the vicinity of LCC on
October 28, 2009 and supplemented with counts taken in November 2007.                 These
intersections were: Ala Ike Street and Waiawa Drive, Waiawa Drive and Farrington Highway
(EB), and Waiawa Drive and Farrington Highway (WB). Data was collected from 7 a.m. to 9
a.m. and 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The two-hour periods were selected after discussions
with the LCC administrative staff and a review of the LCC schedule of classes revealed that
traffic into and out of the campus would be heaviest at these times. Data from 3 p.m. to 6
p.m. was collected from November 2007. The peak hours were found to be: 7:30 a.m. to
8:30 a.m. in the morning, 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. in the afternoon, and 4:00 p.m. to 5:00
p.m. in the evening. Figure 4 illustrates the counts taken and collected and the peak hours
for each time period. Appendix A includes all of the raw count data.

The EB traffic on Farrington Highway is heaviest in the AM peak period when townbound
commuters use it as an alternative to the H-1 Freeway and students and faculty access it to
attend morning classes at LCC. During the mid-day peak period, the EB traffic is still rather
heavy, but the ingress movements to the campus are much lighter, creating fewer
conflicting movements. However, the egress movements are very heavy as the students
and faculty exit the campus after their classes. The EB vehicles queuing at the Ala Ike
Street and Waiawa Drive intersection extend approximately 0.36 miles (to the westernmost
LCC parking lot driveway), as vehicles leave en masse from the LCC parking lot at the end
of mid-day classes. This situation occurs approximately three times during the normal
weekday, at the end of the 10 a.m., 11 a.m., and noon classes. The noon time congestion
was observed to be the worst.

D. Existing Traffic Operations

The intersection Level of Service definitions are provided in Appendix B.

The three intersections of: Ala Ike Street and Waiawa Drive, Farrington Highway (EB) and
Waiawa Drive, and Farrington Highway (WB) and Waiawa Drive were analyzed in regards
to their peak hour control delay.      The results can be found below in Table 1 and the
complete Capacity Analysis Worksheets are available in Appendix C.

Delay is expressed in seconds per vehicle




At the Ala Ike Street and Waiawa Drive intersection, the EB Ala Ike Through-Left Turn
movement operates poorly during the mid-day peak hour (LOS F, 250.3 seconds of delay
per vehicle). It reflects the queuing of vehicles leaving the LCC parking lot after mid-day
classes are finished. The synchronization of class dismissals at LCC in the mid-day leads
to the release of hundreds of outbound vehicles onto Ala Ike Street during short periods of
time. Upon observation, it was determined that similar congested conditions occur around
11 a.m. and 1 p.m., as well.

This Farrington Highway (EB) and Waiawa Drive intersection operates at LOS B during the
AM peak hour, LOS C during the Mid-day peak hour, and LOS B during the PM peak hour.

During the Mid-day peak hour, the NB Waiawa Drive left turn at the Farrington Highway
(WB) and Waiawa Drive intersection experiences excessive delay (LOS F, 154.2 seconds
of delay per vehicle) due to the lack of sufficient gaps in the Farrington Highway WB traffic
and the increase in vehicles from LCC seeking these gaps. The WB Farrington Highway
movements run free and therefore experience minimal control delay.

III. PROJECTED YEAR 2015 CONDITIONS WITHOUT PROJECT

By the year 2015, UHWO is anticipated to be relocated to East Kapolei. LCC's enrollment
is projected to be 9,077, up 19% from the combined enrollment of LCC and UHWO in 2009.

The LCC community will be impacted by the construction of Segments C and D of the
Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project (HHCTCP) in the Year 2015. Three new
structures are also projected to be constructed near the rail line which will follow the
median of Farrington Highway in the vicinity of LCC. The Transit Maintenance Facility is
slated to be constructed on the parcel of land west of Leeward Community College on what
is also currently designated as AG-2 land.         The LCC transit station is slated to be
constructed on the western end of the LCC campus, straddling Ala Ike Street. The Pearl
Highlands transit station is projected to be constructed just mauka of the Farrington
Highway (WB) and Waiawa Drive intersection. The bus pull-out that is currently on the
makai side of Farrington Highway (WB) will be moved to the mauka side and will form the
fourth leg of the Farrington Highway (WB) and Waiawa Drive intersection. This intersection
will be signalized via the HHCTCP by the year 2015.

Figures 5A, 5B, and 5C show the three transit facilities discussed above.

A. Projected Year 2015 Traffic without Project

Although UHWO will leave the LCC campus by the year 2015, the anticipated increase in
enrollment at LCC will create an overall increase in traffic volumes at the three intersections
nearest the campus.

In addition, the background traffic along Farrington Highway (both in the EB and WB
directions) and Ala Ike Street, east of the Waiawa Drive Overpass, is projected to grow at
an annualized rate of 0.9% according to the 2030 Oahu Travel Demand Forecasting Model
(OTDFM).

Generally, the increase in traffic volumes up through the year 2015 will impact many of the
individual movements at the three intersections nearest the LCC campus. These volumes
can be found in Figure 6.

B. Projected Year 2015 Traffic Operations without Project

Table 2 shows the Year 2015 LOS at each intersection. The two movements that will be
impacted most are the EB Ala Ike through-left movement at the Ala Ike Street and Waiawa
Drive intersection and the NB Ala Ike right turn at the Farrington Highway (EB) and Ala Ike
Street intersection. The EB through-left at Ala Ike and Waiawa is projected to continue to
operate at LOS F during the mid-day, but control delay will increase from 250.3 seconds
per vehicle to 451.4 seconds per vehicle. The NB right at Farrington Highway (EB) and Ala
Ike will operate at LOS F (172.1 seconds per vehicle), an increase from LOS E (67.2
seconds per vehicle) in the existing condition.

The signalization at Farrington Highway (WB) and Waiawa Drive is anticipated to greatly
improve the operation of that intersection, particularly for the NB left turns from Waiawa
Drive.

IV. PROJECTED YEAR 2015 CONDITIONS WITH PROJECT

By the year 2015, UHWO is anticipated to be relocated to East Kapolei. LCC's enrollment
is projected to be 9,077, up 19% from the combined enrollment of LCC and UHWO in 2009.
The HHCTCP rail line and structures including the Transit Maintenance Facility, Pearl
Highlands transit station, and LCC transit station are projected to be in-place by the year
2015.

A. Project-Related Traffic Volumes

Figure 7 shows the Project-Related Traffic Volumes generated by the LCC EIIF
development. The LCC EIIF adds only minimal additional traffic volumes to the roadway
network in the year 2015.

The LCC EIIF development is labeled as a Community College (ITE Code 540) land use
according to the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation manual, 8th Edition.
During the AM peak hour a total of 58 trips (29 inbound and 29 outbound) are generated by
the development. During the Mid-day peak hour a total of 49 trips (22 inbound and 27
outbound) are generated by the development. In the PM peak hour, 47 trips (27 inbound
and 20 outbound) are projected to be generated.         Table 3 shows the projected trip
generation for the development.

The Trip Generation Handbook (ITE, 2nd Edition) doesn't publish pass-by percentages for a
Community College land use (540), or any related land uses. But, based upon informal
discussions with a forum of transportation engineers, it is projected that most of the trips
generated by the development will come from vehicle trips that were already attracted to
the site, e.g., a student who drives to the LCC campus to take a class at a pre-existing
structure and then walks to the new LCC EIIF to take an additional class. A pass-by rate of
70% was utilized to determine how many of the trips generated would be new trips. This is
considered to be a conservative estimate.

 LCC EIIF TIAR
The new trips generated by the LCC EIIF development are minimal. Figure 8 details the
minimal increase in total traffic volumes in the year 2015.


Since ingress and egress to and from the LCC campus is limited to Ala Ike Street, Waiawa
Drive, and then to WB and EB onto Farrington Highway, trip distribution and assignment
were projected based upon existing travel patterns.



B. Projected Year 2015 Traffic Operations with Project

Traffic operations are not significantly impacted by the LCC EIIF development.

The Ala Ike Street and Waiawa Drive intersection will operate similarly to the year 2015
without Project scenario. The EB Ala Ike through-left movement will continue to operate at
excessive delay in the mid-day peak hour (LOS F, 466.7 seconds of delay per vehicle).

The Farrington Highway (EB) and Waiawa Drive intersection will operate similarly as the
year 2015 without Project scenario. The LOS in the AM peak hour is anticipated to remain
at C, the mid-day peak hour is expected to be unchanged at LOS D, and the PM peak hour
LOS is expected to be unchanged at LOS B.

The Farrington Highway (WB) and Waiawa Drive intersection is also anticipated to operate
similarly as the year 2015 without Project scenario. The AM peak hour is anticipated to
operate at LOS A, the mid-day peak hour is anticipated to operate at LOS B, and the PM
peak hour is expected to operate at LOS A.

Table 4 details the Projected Year 2015 LOS with Project.

V. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The Leeward Community College Educational and Innovation Instructional Facility is
anticipated to have minimal impact to the roadway network in the vicinity of the existing
LCC campus in the horizon year of 2015. The number of new trips generated by LCC EIIF
are 17 during AM peak hour, 15 during midday peak hour, and 14 during PM peak hour.

It is anticipated that by the year 2015 UHWO will be relocated to its new campus in East
Kapolei and LCC enrollment will continue to grow. The City, as part of its HHCTCP, will
construct Pearl Highlands transit station, LCC transit station, and Transit Maintenance
Facility. The HHCTCP will signalize the Farrington Highway (WB) and Waiawa Drive
intersection as part of the Pearl Highlands transit station construction.

Overall operation at the two intersections of Farrington Highway and Waiawa Drive will run
at the acceptable LOS. The Ala Ike Street and Waiawa Drive intersection will experience
longer delay due to overall student enrollment growth at the LCC.

                             Levels of Service Definitions




The Highway Capacity Manual defines six Levels of Service (LOS), labeled A through F,
from best to worst conditions.        Levels of Service for signalized and unsignalized
intersections are defined in terms of average user delays. Delay is a measure of driver
discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and lost travel time.

For unsignalized intersections, the Highway Capacity Manual evaluates gaps in the major
street traffic flow and calculates available gaps for left-turns across oncoming traffic and for
the left and right-turns onto the major roadway from the minor street.

LEVEL-OF-SERVICE A:           Little or no delay.

LEVEL-OF-SERVICE B:           Short traffic delays.

LEVEL-OF-SERVICE C:           Average traffic delays.

LEVEL-OF-SERVICE D:           Long traffic delays.

LEVEL-OF-SERVICE E:           Very long traffic delays.

LEVEL-OF-SERVICE F:           Demand volume exceeds capacity, resulting in extreme
delays with queuing that may cause severe congestion and affect other movements at the
intersection.

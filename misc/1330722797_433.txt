Executive Summary

Study Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this traffic impact study (TIS) is to evaluate the operational impacts of the proposed
development on the surrounding road network, specifically Springmill Road, in Westfield, Indiana.
The study summarizes the traffic forecast and identifies the operational impacts for two different site
access scenarios.

The scenarios examined in this study are as follows.

   o Scenario 1 ­ Year 2012 AM and PM peak hour traffic, with existing lane configurations.
   o Scenario 2 ­ Year 2014 AM and PM peak hour traffic, with existing lane configurations.
   o Scenario 3 ­ Year 2014 AM and PM peak hour traffic, with the addition of the proposed
     development traffic and one full-access drive onto Springmill Road.
   o Scenario 4 ­ Year 2014 AM and PM peak hour traffic, with the addition of the proposed
     development traffic with one full-access drive onto the existing drive north of the gas station
     and one full-access drive on Lakeville Crossing.
The year 2014 was assumed to be the year at which the development will be fully developed.

The study intersections were as follows:

   o Springmill Road and existing drive north of gas station (Scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4)
   o Springmill Road and proposed development drive (Scenario 3 only)
   o 161st Street and Springmill Road (Scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4) ­ In addition to the development
     driveways on Springmill Road, the intersection of 161st Street and Springmill road was studied
     to ensure queue lengths from either intersection do not spill back to the adjacent intersection.

Additionally, improvements required within the right-of-way have been identified for Scenarios 3 and
4.

Background Information
The Westfield Thoroughfare Plan was used to determine the classifications of the study area roadways.
The existing roadway conditions and land uses within the study area were also reviewed and
considered.

The proposed development is to consist of 4,088 square feet of bank or office land uses. Because trip
generation for a bank land use is higher than for an office building, a bank was used for the purposes of
this study in order to estimate the maximum traffic impacts. Two site design options have been
provided. Site configuration 1 (study scenario 3) provides only one access; a full access driveway
which provides direct access to Springmill Road. Site configuration 2 (study scenario 4) provides two
access points into the adjacent development, but no direct access to Springmill Road. Traffic from the
existing retail land uses within the adjacent development was included.

                                                                                                     -1-
Traffic Forecast
Traffic volumes have been forecasted by determining the base year (2012) traffic volumes using
existing traffic data provided by the City of Westfield, then applying a background traffic growth rate
to obtain the 2014 traffic volumes, and then adding in any new trips generated by the development to
the 2014 background traffic.

Capacity Analysis
A capacity analysis has been performed at each of the study intersections for the above-mentioned
scenarios. To facilitate the analysis, Synchro (Version 8) was used to perform the capacity analysis at
signalized and stop-controlled intersections. An acceptable level of service (LOS) for this study was
considered to be LOS "D" or better at each of the study intersections.

Findings
The study intersection at 161st Street & Springmill Road will operate at or above acceptable levels of
service during the AM and PM peak hours for all study scenarios. Queues from this intersection are
not expected to extend north to the study driveways.
The intersection at Springmill Road and the existing drive will operate above acceptable levels of
service for all study scenarios during the AM peak hour. This intersection currently operates below
acceptable levels of service in the PM peak hour, and will continue to operate below acceptable levels
of service for all study scenarios. Throughout the capacity analysis it became apparent that the
southbound left-turn lane at this intersection would benefit from being extended to accommodate a
100-ft storage length. This would prevent left turning vehicles from blocking the southbound through
lane.
If site configuration 1 is chosen, the proposed drive will operate at or above acceptable levels of
service in both the AM and PM peak hour. The drive should be constructed with one entering lane,
and two exiting lanes. If site configuration 2 is chosen, the access drives should both be constructed
with one entry lane and one exit lane. Two access points would not increase traffic volumes at the
existing drive. However, one access point along Springmill Road would provide direct access to the
adjacent development which would reduce the number of new trips on the roadway system.

Study Purpose and Scope

Study Purpose
The purpose of this traffic impact study (TIS) is to evaluate the operational impacts of a proposed
development on Springmill Road in Westfield, Indiana. The proposed development is to be located on
the east side of Springmill Road north of the intersection of 161st Street & Springmill Road. The study
summarizes the traffic forecast and identifies the operational impacts for two different access
scenarios. In addition to analyzing the impacts of the development on the study intersections, the study
attempts to answer relevant questions to this particular development:

   o What are the operational and safety effects of an additional drive along Springmill Road?
   o What improvements will be required within the right-of-way for each of the access options?
   o What are the drive configurations that would be necessary for each of the access options?

Study Scope
The study estimates the number of new trips that will be generated by the proposed development and
shows how these new trips are distributed to the surrounding public roadway system. The proposed
development is to consist of 4,088 square feet of either bank or general office land uses. The year
2014 was assumed to be the year at which the development will be fully developed. Another multi-use
development currently exists directly to the south and east of the proposed development.

The study area is bounded by 161st Street to the south, the edge of the proposed site to the north,
Springmill Road to the west and Lakeville Crossing to the east. Figure 1 shows the overall study area.
The study intersections include the following:

   o Springmill Road and existing drive north of gas station (Scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4)
   o Springmill Road and proposed development drive (Scenario 3 only)
   o 161st Street and Springmill Road (Scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4) ­ In addition to the development
     driveways on Springmill Road, the intersection of 161st Street and Springmill road was studied
     to ensure queue lengths from either intersection do not spill back to the adjacent intersection.

A traffic capacity analysis has been performed using Synchro, Version 8 software for each of the study
scenarios. The scenarios examined in this study are as follows.
   o Scenario 1 ­ Year 2012 AM and PM peak hour traffic, with existing lane configurations.
   o Scenario 2 ­ Year 2014 AM and PM peak hour traffic, with existing lane configurations.
   o Scenario 3 ­ Year 2014 AM and PM peak hour traffic, with the addition of the proposed
        development traffic and one full-access drive onto Springmill Road.
   o Scenario 4 ­ Year 2014 AM and PM peak hour traffic, with the addition of the proposed
        development traffic with one full-access drive onto the gas station drive and one full-access on
        Lakeville Crossing.
Finally, conceptual drawings have been provided to graphically demonstrate the approach lane
configurations necessary for each study driveway.

Background Information

Proposed Development
The proposed development is to be located on a site north of the intersection of 161st Street &
Springmill Road, as shown in Figure 2 below. The owner has specified the proposed development
will consist of approximately 4,088 square feet of office or bank land uses. For the purpose of this
study, only the bank land use option was used because it produces a higher trip generation; therefore,
any findings within this report will represent the most intense scenario for traffic impacts.

Two access options have been defined for the proposed bank. Site Configuration 1 provides direct
access to Springmill Road while Site Configuration 2 provides direct access to the adjacent
development and no direct access to Springmill Road. These configurations are shown on Figure 2
and Figure 3.

Existing Roadway Conditions Within Study Area
   o Springmill Road: Springmill Road is a 2-lane north-south facility. The speed limit within the
     vicinity of the study area is posted at 45 mph. It is classified in the Westfield Thoroughfare
     Plan as a secondary arterial.

   o 161st Street: 161st Street is a 2-lane east-west facility. The speed limit within the vicinity of the
     study area is posted at 45 mph. It is classified in the Westfield Thoroughfare Plan as a
     secondary arterial.

The study intersection of Springmill Road and 161st Street is a signalized intersection. The intersection
of Springmill Road and the existing access drive is an unsignalized stop-sign controlled intersection
with the access drive stopping for Springmill Road. The existing lane configurations can be seen on
Figure 9.

Existing Land Use Within Study Area
The land uses near the proposed development consist primarily of single family homes or multi-family
homes. Directly adjacent to the proposed site; however, is a multi-use development. This
development includes gas station, grocery store, restaurants, specialty retail, fitness center, and bank
land uses.

Traffic Forecast

Traffic has been forecasted by determining the base year (2012) traffic volumes using existing traffic
data provided by the City of Westfield, then applying a background traffic growth rate to obtain the
2014 traffic volumes, and then adding in any new trips generated by the development to the 2014
background traffic. The following sections of the report provide greater detail of these steps.

Existing Traffic Data
Manual turning movement counts were provided by the City of Westfield. They were collected at the
intersection of 161st Street & Springmill Road on September 28, 2011. Since these counts were
performed only three months ago and no significant development has occurred within the study area
during those months, the counts obtained in September 2011 were assumed to be the existing year
2012 counts. In addition, the City of Westfield provided 24-hour average daily traffic (ADT) counts
for 161st Street and Springmill Road in the vicinity of the study area. The ADT counts were taken
earlier in November 2007. Since these counts are quite old, they were only used to assist in
determining the distribution of the development traffic volumes.

In order to determine turning movement volumes at the existing access drive and Springmill Road,
entering and exiting volumes were estimated based on guidelines provided in ITE's Trip Generation
Report1. Table 1 shows the total projected trips from the existing development.         Appropriate
reductions as described in the Trip Generation Handbook2 were applied to the trips before they were
distributed to the existing drive along Spring Mill Road. This procedure is described in more detail
later within this report.

Background Traffic Growth
It has been assumed the site will be fully developed by the year 2014, and therefore the year 2014 was
chosen as the horizon year. In order to estimate the existing traffic volumes that will be present on the
study area roadways for the year 2014, the background traffic growth must be determined.

Background traffic growth refers to the growth of traffic volumes that occur over time due to
influences outside of the study area. These influences can range from transportation improvements to
the status of the economy. Typically, the background traffic growth rate is determined by comparing
historic traffic counts with current traffic counts.

The background growth rates used in a previous INDOT report3 were used. This study analyzed SR 32
through the city of Westfield which is directly to the north of the proposed site. The INDOT study
used growth rates ranging from 1.4% per year to 2.7% per year. For the proposed bank traffic study,
the average of these rates was used; 2% per year. This growth rate is most likely a conservative
growth rate.

It should also be noted that this growth rate was applied in a linear manner, as opposed to
compounded. Linear growth is growth that occurs at a constant amount per year, as opposed to an
exponentially growing amount added each year (compound growth).

Trip Generation
The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Report, 8th Edition was used to
calculate the generated trips for the proposed development conditions. The owner anticipates that
either a general office or a bank is proposed to be constructed at the site. A trip generation was
performed on both options, but found that a proposed bank would produce more trips. Therefore,
traffic volumes from a proposed bank were used for the analysis. Table 2 contains the number of AM
peak and PM peak trips that would be generated by the proposed development.

Pass-By Trips
Pass-by trips consist of those that are an intermediate stop en route from a trip origin to a trip
destination. For example, on the way home (destination) from work (origin), many people stop along
their route to get fuel (intermediate stop). This is not a new trip for the overall area but does change the
travel pattern of the individual vehicles that were already present.

The ITE Trip Generation Handbook provides estimated pass-by trip percentages for each land use and
was used to determine the appropriate pass-by percentages for the proposed bank. These percentages
were applied to the generated traffic volumes and the non pass-by trips represent the new trips added to
the roadway system by the proposed bank. The pass-by trip reductions are shown in Table 2.

It is noted the AM and PM peak hour mentioned in the above tables refers to the peak hour of the
adjacent street traffic, not to the peak hour of the development.

Internal Trips
Internal trips are trips which have origins and destinations within a development and never actually
travel on the public roadway system. Internal trips will occur during Scenario 4 if Site Configuration 2
is constructed. Site Configuration 2 is connected to the existing development and some trips can be
expected to begin and/or end at the proposed development. Based on procedures set forth in the ITE
Trip Generation Handbook, a 20% internal trip rate was applied to the traffic volumes for Scenario 4.
Although trips could still begin and end at the existing development with Site Configuration 1, these
trips were considered negligible for the analysis since far less vehicles would likely begin or end at the
existing development due to the location of the access drives.

Trip Distribution and Traffic Assignment
The existing land uses and transportation system were taken into account when determining where to
distribute the newly generated trips. In addition to the land uses and transportation system, the existing
traffic volumes on 161st Street and Springmill Road were used to determine the percentage of traffic
that would use each route. Figure 5 shows the trip distribution amounts.

Capacity Analysis

A capacity analysis has been performed for each study intersection and each study scenario based on
the methodology outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual (TRB 2010). The standard parameter used
to evaluate traffic operating conditions is referred to as the level-of-service (LOS). There are six LOS
(A through F), which relate to driving conditions from best to worst, respectively. LOS for both
signalized and unsignalized intersections are defined in terms of control delay per vehicle, which is a
direct correlation to driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and lost travel time. Table 3
provides the LOS criteria as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual. To facilitate the analysis,
Synchro and SimTraffic (Version 8) were used to perform the capacity analysis at signalized and stop-
controlled intersections and driveways. The output from Synchro includes the average vehicle control
delay, LOS, average queue length, and 95th percentile (or maximum) queue length.

Lane Configurations
The existing traffic data, the traffic forecast for the years 2014, and the existing intersection lane
configurations were used as the input for the capacity analysis. A turn-lane warrant analysis was also
performed using procedures described in the Indiana Driveway Permit Manual4 to determine the need
for improvements within the Springmill Road right-of-way for study scenarios 3 and 4. From this
analysis, it was determined that the proposed drive should consist of two exiting lanes and the
northbound approach should have an exclusive right-turn lane and the southbound approach should
have an exclusive left-turn lane. In addition, the existing southbound left-turn lane at the existing drive
along Spring Mill Road currently includes a very limited amount of storage. After an initial capacity
analysis and traffic simulation, an extensive queue was forming on the southbound approach at the
existing drive due to the limited storage of the southbound left-turn lane. Therefore, the recommended
storage length (100 feet) was included within the analysis of scenarios 3 and 4.

Figure 9 shows the existing intersection lane configurations at the study intersections.

Figure 10 and Figure 11 show the proposed year 2014 intersection lane configurations at the study
intersections for study scenarios 3 and 4. Appendix B provides the software output from the capacity
analysis.

Level of Service and Delay Results
Table 5 shows the intersection of 161st Street and Springmill Road will continue to operate at an
acceptable LOS in the year 2014. In terms of delay, none of the scenarios impact the intersection
much worse than any of the other scenarios.

Table 6 shows that the intersection of Springmill Road and the existing drive will continue to operate
at or above an acceptable LOS during the AM peak hour for all scenarios. The PM peak hour currently
operates below acceptable levels of service and will continue to operate below acceptable levels of
service for all scenarios. The Synchro output in Appendix B demonstrates that the unacceptable delay
only occurs on the westbound approach, which is the exit from the development. The northbound
approach is a free flow approach and therefore will not experience significant delay. The southbound
left-turn will experience some delay but does not fall below LOS B for any scenario. This is important
to note because it demonstrates that queues are not expected to extend to the through movements with
a southbound left turn lane storage of 100 feet. In other words, the unacceptable LOS should not affect
the public road, only the development drive. It should be noted that during the PM peak hour, the LOS
goes from F to E from scenario 3 to scenario 4. Delay is measured per vehicle. Since the number of
vehicles increased from scenario 3 to scenario 4, but the overall delay did not significantly increase,
the average delay per vehicle actually reduced. This is further demonstrated when viewing the queue
lengths. The queue length did increase from scenario 3 to scenario 4, reflecting the increased traffic
volumes.

Table 7 shows the intersection of Springmill Road and the proposed drive will operate at or above
acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM peak hour for scenario 3. This scenario represents
the site configuration 2 when all of the proposed bank traffic will use this single drive.

Findings

The capacity analysis has shown that the proposed bank does not have a significant impact on the
study intersections for either of the site configurations. The acceptable level of service for this study
is LOS D. The intersection of 161st Street and Springmill Road operates at or above acceptable levels
of service during all scenarios. The intersection of Springmill Road and the existing drive operates at
or above acceptable levels of service during the AM peak hour for all scenarios. This intersection
currently operates at LOS E during the PM peak hour and will continue to operate at LOS E or F for
each of the site configurations.

The INDOT Driveway Permit Manual was consulted when determining what lane configurations are
necessary at both of the study access drives.

Configuration 1: If site configuration 1 is chosen, the proposed access drive should consist of one
entering lane and two exiting lanes. The northbound approach should consist of a through lane and a
right-turn lane with a storage length of 100 feet and a taper length of 100 feet. The southbound
approach should consist of a left-turn lane with a storage length of 100 feet and a taper length of 100
feet and a through lane. The existing southbound left-turn lane at the existing drive should also be
extended to include 100 feet of storage and a 100 foot taper.

Configuration 2: The access drives should consist of one entering lane and one exiting lane per
guidelines in the INDOT Driveway Permit Manual. The existing southbound left-turn lane at the
existing drive should also be extended to include 100 feet of storage and a 100 foot taper.

Regardless of whether site configuration 1 or site configuration 2 is constructed, the existing
southbound left-turn lane at the existing drive should be extended. Not only is this configuration
recommended per the INDOT Driveway Permit Manual, it would also reduce the risk of southbound
left-turn queues blocking the southbound through movement. The capacity analysis shows all queues
can be accommodated with the proposed turn lane lengths.

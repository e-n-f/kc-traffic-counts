1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1     Background

Belleayre Mountain Ski Center (BMSC) is owned and operated by the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) and is located off of NY Route 28 in
Highmount, New York. BMSC's ski season lasts from November to April, and hosts many
events and activities throughout the year. The first ski lift was built in 1949 and BMSC has been
growing ever since. Today, the Center hosts over 180,000 visitors annually and is one of the
premier skiing locations in the northeast.

In addition to skiing, BMSC hosts a variety of other activities including swimming, hiking,
biking, camping, boating, concerts, and festivals. The weekly concerts begin in early July and
run through August and host a premier lineup of acts that draw over 1,000 concert-goers each
week. Various festivals also take place throughout the year, including Winter Festival Week in
late January. In addition to the concerts, festivals, and summer activities, BMSC holds events
throughout the ski season such as customer appreciation days, races, and other programs for the
community.


1.2     Project Description

NYSDEC is moving forward with a Unit Management Plan (UMP) for the BMSC. The purpose
of a UMP is to assess the existing resources within a land parcel and identify opportunities for
public recreational use. This UMP is considering multi-faceted improvement projects including
trail and ski lift expansions, equipment improvements, and lodge expansions. They are
anticipating that the improvements will increase the peak attendance level to 9,000 patrons on a
single day. A private resort development (Belleayre Resort) is also planned adjacent to BMSC
which includes a hotel, timeshare units and a golf course.

The purpose of this study is to identify the traffic impacts of BMSC's expansion and propose
mitigation measures to offset the traffic impacts..


2.0 EXISTING CONDITIONS
2.1     Transportation Network

The study area for the proposed project includes ten intersections and five roadway segments
within the vicinity of the project and are as follows:




C--I-IA--                                     -1-                                December 2009
Transportation Impact Study                                  Belleayre Mountain Ski Center UMP



        Intersections
         NY Route 28 & NY Route 212
         NY Route 28 & NY Route 214
         NY Route 28 & NY Route 42
         NY Route 28 & County Road (CR) 47
         NY Route 28 & Main Street
         NY Route 28 & CR 49A
         NY Route 28 & CR 38 (in Arkville)
         CR 49A & Gunnison Road/Belleayre Lower Driveway
         CR 49A & Discover Lodge access
         CR 49A & Overlook Road (Belleayre Upper Driveway)

        Roadway Segments
         NY Route 28 west of NY Route 209
         NY Route 28 between NY Route 212 & NY Route 214
         NY Route 28 between CR 38 and NY Route 30
         CR 49A south of the Ski Center Access
         Right turn ramp from NYS Thruway Exit 19

All of the intersections in the study area are unsignalized, controlled by stop signs on the minor
streets. NY Route 28 is a rural minor arterial and begins in Kingston, NY at the NYS Thruway
(I-87) and extends through a rolling landscape to Highmount, NY and continues north to
Warrensburg, NY. Within the study area, NY Route 28 is generally an east-west, two-lane
roadway with a posted speed limit of 55 mph. There are some segments of three or four lanes,
and numerous passing zones. NY Route 28 is a main access route to BMSC and an integral route
through the Catskills region.

CR 49A is a rural minor collector that connects to NY Route 28 in Highmount, NY, past the ski
center and through a rural residential area and reconnected with NY Route 28 in Arkville, NY.
CR 49A is a two-lane road and there is no posted speed limit on CR 49A.


2.2     Traffic Volumes

The Catskill region experiences a seasonal variation in traffic due to various tourist attractions in
the Catskill State Park. Given the seasonal nature of BMSC, traffic volumes within the vicinity
vary depending on the time of year. To provide a conservative, "worst-case" representation of
traffic volumes in the area, the Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday (MLK) holiday weekend was
selected as a representative time frame for analysis. This weekend was selected specifically
because it is one of BMSC's busiest weekends. The peak hour aligns with the time that BMSC



C--I-IA--                                       -2-                                 December 2009
Transportation Impact Study                                 Belleayre Mountain Ski Center UMP


patrons are typically leaving for the day, during the Saturday PM peak hour (approximately 4pm
to 5pm).

Existing traffic volumes were compiled from various traffic counts conducted during 2008 and
2009. The raw traffic volume data compiled is included in Appendix B. Traffic data collected
during the 2008 MLK holiday weekend was compared to data collected in March 2008 and it was
found that the traffic volumes were approximately 40% higher on the Saturday during the holiday
weekend. This information was used to adjust traffic volumes at intersections where volume data
was not available for the holiday weekend. BMSC experienced its highest attendance of the 2001
to 2008 ski seasons on the Saturday of the 2008 MLK holiday weekend when traffic counts were
being conducted. Therefore, this day theoretically represents the worst-case traffic condition on
record for the ski center.

Figure 1 in Appendix A shows the 2008 Existing peak hour traffic volumes within the study area.


2.3     Transit Services

There are various transit services that serve BMSC during the winter and summer seasons. Ulster
County Area Transit (UCAT) runs a free bus service (paid for by BMSC) from Kingston to the
ski center during the ski season and the summer season. It also picks up riders along the way
while it is en route. During the ski season, this bus transports more than 70 round-trip passengers
per day on the weekends with lower ridership on weekdays. During the summer, the bus
transports more than 60 round-trip passengers per day, with more consistent ridership on
weekdays and weekends. This bus service operates at a maximum capacity and additional bus
service would be necessary if higher attendance is planned at BMSC.


3.0 FUTURE CONDITIONS
3.1     No-Build Condition

"No-Build" traffic volumes were developed to estimate the future operations of the study area
without the proposed expansion, to provide a context for evaluating the effect of the traffic
generated by the project. The Existing condition is representative of a high-attendance day at
BMSC and therefore much of the traffic volume on the surrounding roadway network is related to
BMSC. Traffic related to the ski center was removed from the volume network before a growth
rate was applied to the background traffic. Then the existing site traffic was added back into the
network.




C--I-IA--                                      -3-                                December 2009
Transportation Impact Study                                                     Belleayre Mountain Ski Center UMP


At the time that the traffic analysis was prepared, the planned schedule for the UMP was for an
estimated time of completion (ETC) in 2015. An annual growth rate was used to represent the
background traffic growth to this ETC year based on rates used by previous traffic studies
completed in the study area. A conservative growth rate of 2% per year was applied to the 2008
Existing condition to obtain the 2015 (ETC) No-Build traffic volumes. A lesser growth rate of
1.5% per year was applied to the 2015 (ETC) No-Build volumes to estimate the 2025 (ETC+10)
and 2035 (ETC+20) No-Build volumes. This lower growth rate for the future year projections
takes into account lower long-range population growth projections for the region by the Ulster
County Transportation Council (UCTC). Figures 2, 3 and 4 in Appendix A show the resulting
2015 (ETC), 2025 (ETC+10) and 2035 (ETC+20) No-Build Volumes, respectively.

The schedule for the UMP has been revised by the project sponsor, subsequent to the completion
of the traffic projections and analysis for the future conditions, such that the ETC for the project
is now 2018. A review of historic traffic volumes reported by NYSDOT for Route 28 within the
study area (Traffic Data Reports for New York State, 2000-2011) shows that the volumes in the
corridor have changed over the 10-year period from 2001 to 2011 (latest year of available data) at
annualized rates varying from -2.45% to +0.91%. Furthermore, this data shows that the volumes
have been relatively unchanged over the 5-year period from 2006-2011. The exhibit below shows
the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volume trends on NY Route 28 for the period 2006-
2011.

The historic volumes show that the annual 2% background growth rate that was used to establish
the ETC volumes is a conservatively high projection of future traffic. Further, the data shows that
there has generally been little or no change in volume between the 2008 base-year volumes and
current volumes. Based on this, the evaluations of the 2015 (ETC) year and subsequent design
horizons (ETC+10 and ETC+20) are still applicable for the revised ETC year of 2018.


3.2     Site Generated Traffic

There is limited data available from traditional published resources, such as ITE's Trip
Generation, for estimating the trip generation characteristics of ski facilities. Therefore, traffic
data collected at BMSC during the MLK holiday weekend in 2008 and 2009 were used as the
basis for developing a trip generation rate to estimate future trips for the UMP. A weighted
average was taken of the two data samples to produce a trip generation rate. Table 1 below
provides a summary of the data.

                                              Table 1

Based on these data sets, a trip generation rate of 0.18988 trips per patron was used to estimate
the total peak hour trips generated. A distribution of 15% entering and 85% exiting was applied
to the total. Table 2 presents the total and new trips generated by the UMP after completion
based on an attendance of 9,000 patrons, which is the anticipated peak attendance at the expanded
BMSC.

3.3     Trip Distribution

The traffic generated by the BMSC expansion was distributed through the study area based on an
evaluation of existing traffic patterns, patronage zip code data, and the proximity of the site to
area population surrounding Highmount, NY. Based on these evaluations, the estimated site trips
were distributed to study roadways as summarized in Table 3.

3.4     Build Condition

The No-Build traffic volumes were combined with the distributed site generated trips to obtain
the Build condition volumes. This represents the future Saturday peak hour traffic conditions with
the trips associated with the proposed site expansion. Figures 6, 7 and 8 in Appendix A show the
resulting 2015 (ETC), 2025 (ETC+10) and 2035 (ETC+20) Build volumes at the study area
intersections. Figure 9 in Appendix A shows the Build volumes at the parking areas along CR
49A.




4.0 CAPACITY ANALYSES

The operating conditions of transportation facilities are evaluated based on the relationship of
existing or projected traffic volumes to the theoretical capacity of the highway facility. Various
factors affect capacity including traffic volume, travel speed, roadway geometry, grade, number
and width of travel lanes and intersection control. The current standards for evaluating capacity
and operating conditions are contained in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, published by the
Transportation Research Board. The procedures describe operating conditions in terms of Level
of Service (LOS). In general, "A" represents the best operating condition and "F" represents the
worst. Descriptions of LOS and the associated performance measures set forth in the HCM 2000
are provided in Appendix C.

To determine the impact of the UMP on the operations of the adjacent transportation system,
traffic operations of the study intersections and roadway segments were analyzed for the Saturday
peak hour for the following conditions:

            2008 Existing Condition
            2015 (ETC) No-Build Condition
            2015 (ETC) Build Condition
            2025 (ETC+10) No-Build Condition
            2025 (ETC+10) Build Condition
            2035 (ETC+20) No-Build Condition
            2035 (ETC+20) Build Condition

The LOS summary of these conditions is provided in Tables 4 through 6 for the study
intersections and Tables 7 through 9 for the roadway segments. The computation worksheet
summaries are provided in Appendix D.

Since the study period is a Saturday afternoon peak, it represents the condition when patrons are
leaving BMSC and therefore is estimated to have very little effect on the operations of the
westbound ramp from NYS Thruway Exit 19. More site traffic will utilize this ramp during
morning hours when patrons are arriving at BMSC and their arrivals would be spread out over a
longer duration of time. This is a single-lane ramp with an approximate capacity of 2,000
passenger cars per hour that enters into its own lane on NY Route 28 and therefore is anticipated
to operate with sufficient reserve capacity.

4.1     Existing Condition

The operating conditions of the unsignalized intersections within the study area were analyzed
using the existing traffic volumes, roadway geometry, and intersection control. As shown, all of
the unsignalized intersection approaches operate at LOS D or better except for:

        NY Route 28 & CR 49A
           o CR 49A approach: LOS F
        CR 49A & Lower Driveway
           o Gunnison Road approach: LOS E

The LOS E and F operations at these locations are directly related to the peak traffic leaving
BMSC. From the traffic data collected at the site and at the intersection of NY Route 28 & CR
49A, it appears that traffic volumes tail off after the peak hour and that this level of delay is only
experienced during the peak hour. Additionally, this traffic volume condition represents a day
that BMSC experienced its highest single-day attendance of the 2000 to 2008 ski seasons.

All of the roadway segments analyzed are estimated to operate at LOS D or better.


4.2     No-Build Condition

The future operating conditions of the study area intersections were analyzed without the traffic
associated with the UMP to provide a basis of comparison when evaluating the impacts of the
expansion. These operations were estimated using the No-Build traffic volumes along with the
existing roadway geometry and intersection control.


4.2.1    2015 (ETC) No-Build

Similar to the Existing condition, all of the unsignalized intersection approaches operate at LOS
D or better except for:

        NY Route 28 & CR 49A
           o CR 49A approach: LOS F
           o Clubhouse Drive approach: LOS E
        CR 49A & Lower Driveway
           o Gunnison Road approach: LOS E

As stated for the Existing condition, the LOS E and F operations at these locations are related to
the peak traffic leaving BMSC for this conservative, "worst-case" condition.

Similar to the Existing condition, all of the analyzed roadway segments are estimated to operate
at LOS D or better.


4.2.2 2025 (ETC+10) No-Build

All of the same approaches operate at LOS E & LOS F under the 2025 (ETC+10) No-Build
condition as in the 2015 (ETC) No-Build condition with the addition of:

        NY Route 28 & NY Route 214
           o NY Route 214 approach: LOS E
        NY Route 28 & CR 49A
           o Clubhouse Drive approach: LOS F

All of the analyzed roadway segments are estimated to operate at LOS D or better.


4.2.3 2035 (ETC+20) No-Build

All of the same approaches operate at LOS E & LOS F under the 2035 (ETC+20) No-Build
condition as in the 2025 (ETC+10) No-Build condition with the addition of:

        NY Route 28 & NY Route 212
           o NY Route 212 approach: LOS E
        NY Route 28 & NY Route 214
           o NY Route 214 approach: LOS F

All of the analyzed roadway segments are estimated to operate at LOS D or better.


4.3     Build Condition

The future operating conditions of the study area intersections were analyzed with the estimated
site generated traffic associated with the UMP. The operations were estimated using the Build
traffic volumes along with the existing roadway geometry and intersection control. The 2015
(ETC) Build Condition represents operating conditions at the year of opening of the UMP. The
2025 (ETC+10) and 2035 (ETC+20) Build Conditions represent operations during future years
beyond the year of opening. The site trips coming to and from BMSC remain the same however
and only the background traffic volumes increase. Therefore, the 2025 and 2035 Build condition
operations estimate delay for increased traffic unrelated to BMSC.

It is important to note that the conditions analyzed are a "worst-case" peak condition. The
operations at BMSC are likely to be


4.3.1 2015 (ETC) Build Condition

Under the 2015 (ETC) Build condition, the following unsignalized intersection approaches
operate at LOS E or F:

        NY Route 28 & NY Route 212
           o NY Route 212 approach: LOS F
        NY Route 28 & NY Route 214
           o South Street approach: LOS F
           o NY Route 214 approach: LOS F
        NY Route 28 & NY Route 42
           o NY Route 42 approach: LOS F
        NY Route 28 & CR 47
           o CR 47 (NB approach): LOS F
        NY Route 28 & CR 49A
           o CR 49A approach: LOS F
           o Clubhouse Drive approach: LOS F
        CR 49A & North Parking
           o North Lot Driveway: LOS F
        CR 49A & Lower Driveway
           o Belleayre Lower Driveway approach: LOS F
           o Gunnison Road approach: LOS F
        CR 49A & Discovery Lodge
           o Discovery Lodge approach: LOS F
        CR 49A & Upper Discovery Parking
           o Upper Discovery Parking approach: LOS F

While the site generated trips related to the UMP increase delay at some of the study area
intersections, many of the unsignalized approaches still operate with an acceptable volume to
capacity (v/c), indicating that there is reserve capacity. Particularly, NY Route 212 (v/c = 0.63),
NY Route 42 (v/c = 0.58) and CR 47 (v/c = 0.54), though they operate at LOS F still have reserve
capacity based on their v/c ratios. The addition of a left-turn lane on NY Route 28 and separate
turning lanes on the minor street approaches were tested at these locations but saw little
improvement in the operations. Based on these analyses, no improvements are recommended at
these locations for the year of opening.

Transportation Impact Study                                Belleayre Mountain Ski Center UMP


The intersections of NY Route 28 & NY Route 214, NY Route 28 & CR 49A and CR 49A &
Lower Driveway are estimated to operate with higher levels of delay and v/c ratios that exceed
capacity (greater than 1.0). These intersections are addressed under mitigation improvements.

The segment of NY Route 28 from NY Route 375 to NY Route 212 is estimated to operate at
LOS E for the Build condition. However, it still is estimated to operate with reserve capacity
with a v/c ratio of 0.71 and no improvements are recommended for this roadway segment.


4.3.2 2025 (ETC+10) Build Condition

All of the same approaches operate at LOS F under the 2025 (ETC+10) Build condition as in the
2015 (ETC) Build condition with the addition of:

        NY Route 28 & Main Street
           o Main Street approach: LOS E

Similar to the 2015 (ETC) condition, many unsignalized approaches that are estimated to operate
at LOS F still have an acceptable v/c ratio. NY Route 212, South Street, NY Route 42, CR 47,
Main Street and the Discovery Lodge driveway still have reserve capacity based on their v/c
ratios.

The intersections of NY Route 28 & NY Route 214, NY Route 28 & CR 49A, CR 49A & Lower
Driveway, CR 49A & North Parking and CR 49A & Upper Discovery Lodge are estimated to
operate with higher levels of delay and v/c ratios that exceed capacity (greater than 1.0).
Mitigation for future years beyond year of opening is addressed in the mitigation improvements
section.

Like the ETC Condition, the segment of NY Route 28 from NY Route 375 to NY Route 212 is
estimated to continue to operate at LOS E. However, it still is estimated to operate with reserve
capacity.


4.3.3 2035 (ETC+20) Build

All of the same approaches and roadway segments operate at LOS E & LOS F under the 2035
(ETC+20) Build condition as in the 2025 (ETC+10) Build condition.

5.0 MITIGATION IMPROVEMENTS

5.1     Year of Opening - 2015 (ETC)

At the intersection of NY Route 28 and NY Route 214, the increase in delay is related to the
additional site trips eastbound on NY Route 28 during the peak hour. The addition of a right-turn
lane on NY Route 214 and an eastbound left-turn lane on NY Route 28 will reduce the delay
estimated on the NY Route 214 approach and bring the v/c ratio below one.

The intersection of NY Route 28 & CR 49A is estimated to operate with high levels of delay
during the Saturday peak hour with the UMP. While it is not anticipated that this delay will be
experienced on weekdays, to provide the safe and efficient movement of traffic in the area, a
greater level of traffic control may be needed. The addition of a northbound right-turn lane on
CR 49A and the installation of a traffic signal would provide LOS D operations at the
intersection. This signal could be set to rest in green on NY Route 28 or switched to flashing
operations during weekdays and/or the off-season.

The delay experienced at the North Lot, Lower Driveway, Discovery Lodge and Upper Discovery
parking is related to exiting traffic leaving the parking areas to the west of them, causing less gaps
to be available eastbound on CR 49A. Event management traffic control strategies could be
implemented to help control and direct traffic during the peak hour. Staffing the driveways
would allow them to stop CR 49A eastbound traffic to allow movements from the parking areas.

The intersections of NY Route 28 & CR 49A and NY Route 28 & NY Route 214 were analyzed
with the recommended mitigation improvements. The results are presented in Table 10.

Since these analyses are representative of a worst-case condition, a sensitivity analysis of the site
generated traffic was completed to determine what the operations would be at these two
intersections if the ten highest attendance days of the ski season were disregarded. The
attendance history at BMSC for the 2001 to 2008 ski seasons was reviewed to determine the
relationship between the peak attendance day to other days of the year. From the eight years of
attendance data available, it was determined that the 11th highest attendance day (i.e. disregarding
the ten highest) is on average 32.5% lower than the peak attendance day. For the UMP condition,
this would be equivalent to an attendance of 6,078 patrons, just 188 more than the existing peak
day. Based on attendance for previous years, this would represent approximately the 93 rd
percentile attendance level.

The site generated traffic at the intersections of NY Route 28 & NY Route 214 and NY Route 28
& CR 49A was estimated to determine the operations for this condition. The LOS summary is
provided in Table 11. For this condition, the NY Route 214 approach to NY Route 28 operates
with a v/c ratio of 0.54 and geometric improvements at the intersection would not be necessary.
At the intersection of NY Route 28 & CR 49A, with an attendance of 6,078 patrons, only the
right-turn lane on the CR 49A approach is needed to bring the delay and v/c ratio to levels lower
than the No-Build condition.

Given that only ten ski season days are estimated to experience higher attendance than this
condition, it is recommended that the mitigation improvements are considered for this reduced
condition rather than the peak attendance day. Other traffic demand and event management
strategies could be implemented to distribute the traffic load on the system. Staggering the
closing times of different ski lifts rather than closing them all at the same time would spread the
departures over a longer period of time. Similarly, keeping other facilities open in the Discovery
and Overlook Lodges so that patrons are encouraged to stay at the facility longer after the lifts are
closed would also spread the load of departures to other times of the day. Providing variable
message signs at key locations in the corridor could also communicate to drivers on heavy ski
days that traffic delays may be experienced. It is also recommended that the transit services to
BMSC be expanded for the UMP; the increased use of shuttles to transport passengers could also
reduce the traffic impacts to the study area intersections.


5.2     Future Years Г 2025 (ETC+10) & 2035 (ETC+20)

As discussed in Section 4.3, delay does increase for the future Build Conditions. However, the
increases in vehicle delay are all related to growth in background traffic volumes, not to traffic
from BMSC. Conservative estimates of background traffic growth were made for the future No-
Build and Build conditions. It is recommended that the mitigation improvements implemented
for this project are based on the 2015 (ETC) analyses and that traffic monitoring will continue for

    Note: Intersection Accident Rates are stated as accidents per million entering vehicles. Link Accident Rates are stated as
    accidents per million vehicle miles.


             In Table 9 (Accident Severity Summary), the accident rates for the intersections and links are
             compared to statewide averages for similar types of facilities. Though the study area
             intersections had low accident counts during the three years investigated, some of the intersection
             accident rates are still higher than the statewide average accident rates. This is likely due to the
             relatively low seasonally adjusted daily entering volume (DEV) used to calculate the accident
             rate. Descriptions of the accident summaries for the intersections and links are provided below.

NY Route 28 & NY Route 212 included five reported accidents with a variety of accident types.
Two of the accidents were collisions with a fixed object and occurred on the same day and
involved a piece of debris/obstruction in the roadway. The pattern of accidents at this location
does not indicate that there are safety deficiencies at this location.

NY Route 28 & NY Route 214 included a left-turn collision and two rear end collisions. One of
the rear end collisions was caused by alcohol involvement. The pattern of accidents at this
location does not indicate that there are safety deficiencies at this location.

NY Route 28 & NY Route 42 saw one accident during the three-year period. The accident
involved a collision with an animal and does not indicate that there are safety deficiencies at this
location.

NY Route 28 & Main Street included a rear end and a fixed object collision. They were noted to
be caused by driver inattention and do not indicate that there are safety deficiencies at this
location.

NY Route 28 & CR 38 included a fixed object and two "other" collisions. The fixed object and
one of the "other" collisions were related to defective vehicle components (brakes, hitch) and the
other "other" collision was with an animal. None of these indicate that there are safety
deficiencies at this location.

NY Route 28: NY Route 209 to NY Route 212 Г 337 accidents were reported for this segment
during the three-year period investigated. The number of recorded accidents is much higher than
other segments because this segment is 18 miles long. Five of these accidents resulted in
fatalities. The details from the state verbal description reports were reviewed for each of these
accidents and it was found that two of the accidents were related to a vehicle failing to keep right
in a no passing zone (though not is the same area), one related to failing to yield to the right-of-
way when making a left-turn, one following too closely and the last was related to alcohol
involvement. In addition to the fatalities, 102 of the 337 accidents were caused by animal
interaction. There were no apparent clusters of accidents in this segment; the occurrence of
accidents was distributed along the 18-mile segment.

NY Route 28: NY Route 212 to NY Route 214 Г 25 accidents were reported for this four-mile
segment. One of these accidents resulted in a fatality, which was related to snow and slippery
pavement conditions. Eleven of the 25 accidents were caused by animal interaction.

CR 49A: NY Route 28 to Todd Mountain Road Г just one accident was reported in this segment
during the time period investigated. This was a fixed object accident that was related to snow and
slippery pavement conditions.

NY Route 28: CR 38 to NY Route 30 Г This is the only analyzed link segment that exceeded the
statewide average. Twenty-seven accidents were reported for this two-mile segment during the
time period investigated. Five of the accidents were caused by animal interaction and three were
related to alcohol involvement. The character of this portion of NY Route 28 is different than the
rest of the study area as there are more access points to residences and businesses and they are
more closely spaced than other areas of the corridor. Rear end type accidents occurred more than
other types in this segment which may indicate the need for access management improvements.
Only 5% of the new site trips are estimated to travel this segment of the corridor so it is not
anticipated that the traffic related to the UMP will affect the safety of the corridor.


6.2     Sight Distance Evaluation

A sight distance evaluation was conducted for all of the existing and proposed driveways to the
BMSC facilities and parking areas along CR 49A. Sight distance was measured in the field at
each access point for the following parameters:

        Stopping sight distance on major road
        Left-turn from minor road
        Right-turn from minor road
        Left-turn from major road

The measurements taken and the criteria it is compared to are based on the A Policy on
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 2004 published by the American Association of State
Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). Table 14 lists the sight distance criteria based
on various design speeds for a single-unit truck. The criteria were based on a single-unit truck as
a consideration of the use of shuttle busses at BMSC.

The speed limit is not posted on CR 49A. Speed data collected on CR 49A with automatic traffic
recorders (ATRs) shows that the 85th percentile speeds on CR 49A within the study area vary
from approximately 53 mph near the split at Old Schoolhouse Road to approximately 42 mph
within the vicinity of Overlook Road. CR 49A has rolling terrain, typical in a mountain setting,
with many changes in the vertical and horizontal alignment. Because of this, the speeds vary
through the corridor depending on the geometric conditions. Based on the prevailing speed seen
in the data collected, the sight distance measurements on CR 49A will be compared to the 45 mph
design speed criteria.

Van Loan Road intersects CR 49A just west of NY Route 28; the proposed East Lot will have
access to Van Loan Road. There is no posted speed on Van Loan Road. The roadway section
within the vicinity of the proposed driveway to the East Lot is only approximately 15 feet wide.
Given the restrained geometrics of the roadway and that the proposed driveway is only 360 feet
from CR 49A and most vehicles would be accelerating or decelerating within the vicinity of the
driveway, a 35 mph design speed is assumed for the sight distance evaluations for the East Lot.

Table 15 below summarizes the sight distance measurements conducted in the field. A detailed
discussion of each driveway location follows.

Stopping sight distance is the visible distance for a driver traveling at or near the design speed
within which they can stop before reaching a stationary object in their path. Intersection sight
distance is provided to allow drivers of stopped vehicles to decide when to enter an intersecting
roadway. If the intersection sight distance is at least equal to the stopping sight distance, then
drivers have sufficient distance to anticipate and avoid a collision. The additional distance
provided in the criteria for intersection sight distance allows for the acceleration of the entering
vehicle so that a vehicle on the major roadway does not have to adjust their speed.1 Therefore,
stopping sight distance is the more critical element to achieve when evaluating sight distance.

Overlook Road (Existing)
The stopping sight distance in both directions on CR 49A and left-turn from CR 49A onto
Overlook Road meet the criteria for a 45 mph design speed at this location. The sight distance for
making a left-turn (looking right) from the driveway is 320 feet and does not meet the criteria for
a 45 mph design speed, which is 630 feet. The sight distance for making a right-turn (looking
left) from the driveway is 375 feet and also does not meet the criteria for a 45 mph design speed
which is 565 feet. The sight distance looking right from the driveway is limited by the horizontal
curvature of CR 49A. Looking to the left from the driveway is limited by the vertical and
horizontal curvature of CR 49A.

It is noted that the sight distance limitations are an existing condition and the accident history
does not indicate that there are safety issues related to sight distance. The sight distance looking
to the right from the driveway may be improved by selective clearing of vegetation and trees
along the south side of CR 49A, east of the intersection. With the clearing, it is estimated that the
minimum sight distance of 630 feet could be obtained. It is also recommended that intersection
warning signs (W2-2) be placed in both directions on CR 49A in advance of Overlook Road.

Upper Discovery (Proposed)
The driveway to the proposed Upper Discovery Lot will be approximately 1000 feet to the west
of the existing Discovery Lodge driveway. The stopping sight distance in both directions on CR
49A and left-turn from the driveway (looking right) meet the criteria for a 45 mph design speed at
this location. The sight distance for making a right-turn (looking left) from the driveway is 455
feet and does not meet the criteria for a 45 mph design speed, which is 565 feet. The sight
distance for making a left-turn into the driveway from CR 49A is 390 feet and also does not meet
the criteria for a 45 mph design speed, which is 430 feet. Sight distance for both of these
conditions is limited by the horizontal and vertical curvature of CR 49A west of the driveway.

To advise drivers traveling eastbound on CR 49A of an upcoming driveway, it is recommended
that an intersection warning sign (W2-2) be placed in advance of the Upper Discovery driveway.

Discovery Lodge (Existing)
The stopping sight distance in both directions of CR 49A and left-turn from the driveway
(looking right) meet the criteria for a 45 mph design speed at this location. The sight distance for
making a right-turn from the driveway (looking left) is 315 feet and does not meet the criteria for
a 45 mph design speed, which is 565 feet. The measured sight distance for making a left-turn
from CR 49A is 345 feet and does not meet the criteria for a 45 mph design speed, which is 430
feet. The sight distance for both of these are limited by the vertical alignment of CR 49A in this
area.

To advise drivers traveling eastbound on CR 49A of an upcoming driveway, it is recommended
that an intersection warning sign (W2-2) be placed in advance of the Discovery Lodge
intersection.

Lower Driveway (Existing)
The stopping sight distance in both directions
on CR 49A, right-turn from the driveway and
left-turn from CR 49A all meet the criteria for
a 45 mph design speed at this location. It is
noted that there is a large BMSC way finding
sign next to this driveway that obstructs the
view looking to the left from the driveway at
some distances. A driver exiting the parking
lot can see through the sign supports but there
are some portions of the eastbound approach
of CR 49A that are blocked by the sign

relocated outside of the intersection sight
lines.

It is noted that the sight distance limitations are an existing condition and the accident history
does not indicate that there are safety issues related to sight distance. The sight distance for
making a left-turn from the driveway (looking right) does not meet the criteria for a 45 mph
design speed, which is 630 feet. The sight distance looking to the right from the Lower Driveway
could be improved with a minimal amount of clearing of trees and vegetation on the south side of
CR 49A. With the clearing, it is estimated that the sight distance would be at least the 630 feet
for the 45 mph design speed. It is noted that the volume of traffic turning left from this driveway
is low.

North Lot (Proposed)
The driveway to the proposed North Lot will be approximately 265 feet to the west of Old
Schoolhouse Road. The stopping sight distance in both directions on CR 49A, right-turn from the
driveway (looking left) and left-turn from CR 49A all meet the criteria for a 45 mph design speed
at this location. The sight distance for making a left-turn from the driveway (looking right) is 545
feet and does not meet the criteria for a 45 mph design speed, which is 630 feet. Sight distance
looking right from the driveway location is limited by the horizontal curvature of CR 49A.

To advise drivers traveling westbound on CR 49A of an upcoming driveway, it is recommended
that an intersection warning sign (W2-2) be placed in advance of the North Lot driveway.

East Lot (Proposed)
The driveway to the proposed East Lot will be on Van Loan Road, approximately 360 feet from
CR 49A. As stated previously, the speed limit is not posted on Van Loan Road but for the
purposes of this evaluation, it is assumed that the design speed is no more than 35 mph. The
stopping sight distance on Van Loan Road, left- and right-turn from the driveway and left-turn
into the driveway from Van Loan Road are all estimated to meet the criteria for a 35 mph design
speed at this location.


6.2.2 Recommendations

As described above, each driveway location along CR 49A has at least one sight distance element
that does not meet the criteria for intersection sight distance for a 45 mph design speed. CR 49A
is a rural, winding road with many changes in horizontal and vertical alignment within the project
area. Based on data collected in the corridor for prevailing speeds and the sight distance
evaluations, it is recommended that CR 49A be posted for a 40 mph speed limit.

The measured stopping sight distances at all of the driveway locations along CR 49A meet the
recommended criteria for a 45 mph design speed. Stopping sight distance is the more critical
element to achieve when investigating sight limitations along a roadway. So while there are some
intersection sight distance elements that do not meet the recommended criteria, vehicles traveling
on CR 49A have sufficient sight lines to vehicles turning into and out of the driveways for traffic
to safely enter and exit the site. Additionally, all but two (Overlook Road and Lower Discovery)
intersection sight distance measurements exceed the criteria for stopping sight distance, indicating
that a driver would have sufficient time to anticipate and avoid a collision. As a precaution,
intersection warning signs can be placed in advance of the driveways to inform drivers on CR
49A of the possibility of turning or entering traffic.

The following measures are recommended to mitigate the sight distance conditions, in addition to
the recommended implementation of a 40 mph posted speed limit:

         Overlook Road Г clear trees and vegetation on south side of CR 49A, east of
         intersection, to achieve sight distance looking to right from driveway of at least 630 feet.
         Install intersection warning signs (W2-2) in both directions on CR 49A in advance of
         driveway.
         Upper Discovery - install intersection warning sign (W2-2) for eastbound traffic on CR
         49A in advance of driveway.

         49A in advance of driveway.
         Lower Discovery Г clear trees and vegetation on south side of CR 49A, east of
         intersection, to achieve sight distance looking to right from driveway of at least 630 feet.
         Relocate the existing BMSC way finding sign outside of the intersection sight lines.
         North Lot - install intersection warning sign (W2-2) for westbound traffic on CR 49A in
         advance of driveway.

The estimated schedule shown phases the construction of the UMP elements where each type of
facility improvement (trails & lifts, utilities, facilities, etc.) is built over the duration of the
construction. Each construction year will require different staff and equipment resources which
will vary throughout the season. Table 17 summarizes the peak resource needs for each
construction year.

The resource needs suggest that the work being completed in Year 2 will require the most

Additionally, the movement of equipment and materials to and from the site will occur
throughout the course of the day which will also minimize any impacts related to site activities.

8.0 CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS

The expansion of BMSC under the UMP is proposed to add trails and lifts, improve equipment
and expand their lodges. With these facility improvements, it is anticipated that the peak
attendance level would be a maximum of 9,000 patrons a day. However, this would not be a
regular occurring level of attendance. In fact, historical attendance data available from BMSC,
shows that the current one-time peak attendance day (since 2000) for their existing facility is
5,890 patrons but the average Saturday attendance was on average 57 percent lower than the peak
attendance day. This would indicate that the average Saturday attendance with the UMP could be
expected to be approximately 3,900 patrons.

The traffic evaluations were conducted for this maximum peak attendance day and therefore
represent a conservative "worst-case" representation of traffic volumes in the area. Traffic counts
were conducted on the MLK holiday weekend where ski centers in the area typically see an
increase in attendance. The traffic evaluations were conducted for the Saturday PM peak hour,
when ski patrons are typically leaving at the end of the day. Because the traffic data does
represent a time when many patrons are leaving at the same time, the nature of these traffic
patterns are event-like and do not represent a regular, reoccurring level of traffic and congestion.

The site trips related to the proposed expansion were estimated based on a trip rate calculated
from data collected at the ski center on the MLK weekend in 2008 and 2009. Based on this, it
was estimated that the expansion will generate 736 new trips during the peak seasonal condition
of full occupancy Saturday PM peak hour (110 entering and 626 exiting).

The study area intersections were analyzed for Existing, No-Build and Build conditions to
identify the current operating conditions on the peak holiday weekend, the future conditions
without the ski center expansion and future conditions with the ski center expansion. The
Existing analysis showed that there are a couple of intersection approaches near the ski center that
experience LOS E or F during the Saturday peak hour when patrons are exiting the site. The No-
Build evaluations determined that similar locations experienced LOS E or F conditions, though
some had higher levels of delay due to the increase in background traffic unrelated to the ski
center. The Build condition analyses show that additional intersection approaches are estimated
to operate at LOS E or F with the addition of the UMP traffic. Analyses were also conducted for
future years beyond the year of opening. However, any increases in delay and congestion for
these conditions are related to growth in background traffic only and not a result of additional
traffic from BMSC.




C--I-IA--                                      - 30 -                              December 2009
Transportation Impact Study                                 Belleayre Mountain Ski Center UMP


The number of intersections that experience LOS E or F on the minor street approaches does
increase under the Build condition. However, for some of the intersections, the v/c ratio indicates
that there is still reserve capacity at the intersection and the addition of turning lanes at the
intersections does not necessarily improve the operations. Additionally, many of the intersections
listed that experience LOS E or F are driveways from BMSC and the vehicles experiencing the
delay are contained within the site.

The traffic operations at BMSC are event-like in nature in that they are not regular reoccurring
conditions and therefore should not be used as a basis for design of transportation facilities.
Based on the evaluations and looking at what improvements are necessary for a reduced
attendance condition that will serve most of the operating days at the ski center, it is
recommended that a northbound right-turn lane be installed on the CR 49A approach to NY
Route 28. It is recommended that traffic is monitored for future years before implementing
additional geometric or traffic control improvements to determine if the background traffic
growth and estimated site traffic is consistent with the projections.

Other traffic demand and event management strategies could be implemented to distribute the
traffic load on the system. Staggering the closing times of different ski lifts rather than closing
them all at the same time would spread the departures over a longer period of time. Similarly,
keeping other facilities open in the Discovery and Overlook Lodges so that patrons are
encouraged to stay at the facility longer after the lifts are closed would also spread the load of
departures to other times of the day. Providing variable message signs at key locations in the
corridor could also communicate to drivers on heavy ski days that traffic delays may be
experienced. It is also recommended that the transit services to BMSC be expanded for the UMP;
the increased use of shuttles to transport passengers could also reduce the traffic impacts to the
study area intersections.

An accident history analysis was conducted to determine if there are any patterns of crashes
within the study area that indicate a deficiency in the design or operations of the system. Some of
the intersections and one of the roadway segments analyzed exceeded the statewide average
accident rate for similar facilities. A review of all of the accidents determined that many were
caused by animal interaction or related to snow or slippery pavement conditions. There were six
fatal accidents within the corridor during the three years that were analyzed. Each of these fatal
accidents was a result of different circumstances and there are no evident patterns or clusters of
accidents that indicate a safety deficiency.

A sight distance evaluation was conducted for all of the existing and proposed driveways serving
BMSC. Since there are no posted speed limits within the vicinity of the site, sight distance
criteria was assumed for a 45 mph design speed on CR 49A and 35 mph on Van Loan Road. The
evaluation determined that there are some sight distance limitations for vehicles turning into and



C--I-IA--                                     - 31 -                              December 2009

out of the site driveways and they are all related to the horizontal and vertical alignments of CR
49A. However the stopping sight distance on the major roadway meets the recommended criteria
at all of the driveway locations.

It is recommended that CR 49A be posted for a 40 mph speed limit and that the following
measures are taken to improve the sight lines and driver awareness:

        Lower Driveway Г clear trees and vegetation on south side of CR 49A, east of
        intersection. Relocate the existing BMSC way finding sign outside of the intersection
        sight lines.
        Discovery Lodge Г install intersection warning sign (W2-2) for eastbound traffic on CR
        49A in advance of driveway.
        Overlook Road Г clear trees and vegetation on south side of CR 49A, east of intersection.
        Install intersection warning signs (W2-2) in both directions on CR 49A in advance of
        driveway.
        Upper Discovery - install intersection warning sign (W2-2) for eastbound traffic on CR
        49A in advance of driveway.
        North Lot - install intersection warning sign (W2-2) for westbound traffic on CR 49A in
        advance of driveway.

In summary, the traffic conditions that have been evaluated are for a worst-case, event-like
condition. They do not represent a reoccurring pattern of traffic and therefore should not be used
as a design condition. Based on this and the recommendations aforementioned, the expansion of
BMSC will not have an adverse effect on the operations of the area transportation system.

Signalized Intersections

                LOS CRITERIA FOR SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
                        LOS                Control Delay per Vehicle (s/veh)*
                         A                                10
                         B                              > 10-20
                         C                              > 20-35
                         D                              > 35-55

LOS A describes operations with low control delay, up to 10 s/veh. This LOS occurs
when progression is extremely favorable and most vehicles arrive during the green
phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may tend to contribute to
low delay values.

LOS B describes operations with control delay greater than 10 and up to 20 s/veh. This
level generally occurs with good progression, short cycle lengths, or both. More vehicles
stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of delay.

LOS C describes operations with control delay greater than 20 and up to 35 s/veh.
These higher delays may result from only fair progression, longer cycle lengths, or both.
Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. Cycle failure occurs when a
green phase does not serve queued vehicles, and overflows occur. The number of
vehicles stopping is significant at this level, though many still pass through the
intersection without stopping.

LOS D describes operations with control delay greater than 35 and up to 55 s/veh. At
LOS D, the influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result
from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, or high volume-
to-capacity (v/c) ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping
declines. Individual cycle failures are noticeable.

LOS E describes operations with control delay greater than 55 and up to 80 s/veh.
These high delay values generally indicate poor progression, long cycle lengths, and
high v/c ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent.

LOS F describes operations with delay in excess of 80.0 s/veh. This level, considered
unacceptable to most drivers, often occurs with over-saturation, that is, when arrival flow
rates exceed the capacity of lane groups. It may also occur at high v/c ratios with many
individual cycle failures. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also be contribute
significantly to high delay levels. Often, vehicles do not pass through the intersection in
one signal cycle.
Unsignalized Intersections

The level of service criteria for an unsignalized intersection differs from that of a
signalized intersection because of the expectation that signalized intersections
encounter more traffic and therefore greater delays. The thresholds for the levels of
service of unsignalized intersections are as follows:

                        D                      > 25-35
                        E                      > 35-50

Concept
   Difference between private and public
   purchasing is that dollars spent by government
   are generally tax dollars.
   Tax dollars place government buying into the
   public and sometimes political arena.
   To this is added the obligation to maximize the
   use of citizen's tax dollars and purchase in the
   best interest of the Town's operations.
   Fair and equitable treatment.
   Maximize competition/provide equal access to
   businesses that want to do business with the
   Town.

   activity zone uses; modifications to activity zone requirements providing consistency
   with the sign ordinance; amending standards for sidewalks, street trees, access
   points to developments, common wall construction, and easements pertaining to
   interconnectivity; amending provisions for bonus density incentives and for build-to

   Johnnie Dodds Boulevard Urban Corridor Overlay District; and modification of
   Definitions for consistency with other proposed amendments and relocation of the
   same to § 156.007.

Ms. Cousino reviewed staff comments as follows:
   STAFF COMMENTS
   1. The Planning Committee of Council held two special meetings in December 2013 and
      January 2014 pertaining to potential modifications to the UC-OD, Urban Corridor
      Overlay District. The Committee also discussed potential changes to setbacks and lot
      standards at its regular February 2014 meeting.
   2. The Committee recommended certain changes, as described above, and directed staff to
      proceed with a public hearing.
   3. The proposed amendments also include changes that were to be part of the amendments
      associated with the Use Table, such as: moving definitions to Section 156.007, adding
      PI-1 District uses as permitted uses on parcels with an underlying residential zoning,
      adding CO District uses as permitted uses on parcels with an underlying commercial
      zoning, clarifying where activity zones are allowed, and modifying activity zone permit
      requirements.

Mr. Neal asked that staff review the changes in the ordinance. Ms. Cousino reviewed the
changes with the Commission.

Mr. Chapman entered at this time 5:25 pm.

Mr. Neal asked about parking and what changes were made. Ms. Cousino answered that
residential is currently a range between one and two spaces per unit, but will now require two
spaces per unit which must be provided on the individual lots. She stated that the commercial
parking would have to be met onsite and on-street parking would not count toward the parking
requirement. Mr. Neal asked about street width. Ms. Cousino answered that a minimum 33-
foot public right-of-way would be required in order to subdivide, but any alleys would remain
private. Mr. Neal asked if the 33-foot width includes sidewalks on both sides. Ms. Cousino
answered in the affirmative. Mr. Neal asked about setbacks. Ms. Cousino answered that there
are several sections where this changed, primarily in the "C" subsections of the Coleman-Ben
Sawyer Urban Corridor and pointed these out on the map for the Commission. She stated that
the footnote would be removed so that the setback reduction would not be allowed. She stated
that setbacks on existing side streets would be as specified in the Development Guidelines
Chart, but setbacks could be five feet on new streets. Mr. Neal asked about the approval
process and if the scope of a project changed, would it require any additional approvals. Ms.
Cousino answered that the approval process changes mainly pertain to which body has approval
authority. She stated that minor changes could be approved at staff level, but larger changes
would require Commission approval.

Mr. Richardson asked about flood zones on page 13 and why "floodproofing" was not removed.
Ms. Cousino answered that it was not a recommendation of the Planning Committee to make
that change. She stated that she has not been made aware of any situations where this was an
issue. Mr. Richardson stated that there are instances where commercial uses would not be
                                                            DRAFT MINUTES ­ Planning Commission
                                                                                February 19, 2014
                                                                                     Page 3 of 20

feasible on the bottom floor. Ms. Cousino answered that in those instances commercial uses
might not be able to be accommodated on the particular site. Mr. Richardson asked about the
reason for removing easements and only having dedicated right-of-ways. Ms. Cousino answered
that there are no defined standards for easements, particularly as they relate to emergency access.
Mr. Prause answered that the other issue is maintenance and ownership. Ms. Cousino concurred
and stated that often private roads are not constructed to Town standards. Mr. Richardson
asked if there was consideration to allow easements or smaller roadway widths that are built to
Town standards. Mr. Prause answered in the negative and stated that if not built as a public
street, there is the potential to have a future request for the Town to maintain those roadways so
they should be built to Town standards upfront. Mr. Richardson asked about one-way right-of-
ways and why this was not considered. Ms. Cousino answered that based on the
recommendation for the 33-foot right-of-way from Planning Committee, one way roads were
not considered. Ms. Richardson suggested that this could be accomplished and built to Town
standards and suggested that this should be explored. Mr. Richardson asked about parking
space size standards and that the term "generally" should be removed. Mr. Prause suggested
that it could state "should be no less than...". Mr. Richardson asked about parallel parking
standards. Ms. Cousino answered that this would be determined with the parking master plan.
Mr. Richardson suggested that there could be internal streets and there is no provision for
parallel parking standards. Mr. Prause answered that staff is working on revisions to the parking
requirements and suggested that it would be addressed at that time.

Mr. Richardson asked if single family dwelling unit design review was removed. Ms. Cousino
answered that it has been difficult to apply the current commercial standards to single family
dwelling projects. Mr. Richardson asked about moving design review to after preliminary plat
approval. Ms. Cousino answered that it might be difficult to show a building footprint on a
sketch plan or preliminary plat, and then have changes to the placement of the building footprint
during design review. If this occurred, then they would have to come back to the Commission,
which might be cumbersome.

Mr. Chapman suggested that having the public meeting might trigger more issues or questions.
Mr. Neal answered that he would like to give the Commission an opportunity to address some
comments before the public hearing.

Ms. Woods-Flowers asked about page 7 where it outlines why activity zones are prohibited. Ms.
Cousino answered that, based on the existing definition of activity zone, any area with a setback
is prohibited from having an activity zone and she reviewed these areas with the Commission.

Mr. Siegrist suggested that the on-street parking not counting toward the parking requirement
should be strictly enforced.

Mr. James Scott, 506 Royall Ave, stated that he appreciates the time and effort of staff, Town
Council, and the Commission. He asked for a favorable vote on the amendments.

Mr. Jimmy Bagwell, 207 William St, concurred with Mr. Scott and is in favor of the changes. He
asked what the impact on density would be if the changes are adopted as many of the residents
were concerned with the density previously allowed.

Mr. Bill Eubanks, Urban Edge Studio, asked that page 11, under on-street parking should be
changed to include "...except along that development's frontage". He also suggested that on
page 15, under parking location, the Commission should add "...or within the overall
boundaries of that development".
                                                                    DRAFT MINUTES ­ Planning Commission
                                                                                        February 19, 2014
                                                                                             Page 4 of 20


Mr. Vince Graham, 414 Whilden St, suggested that this is an effort to put suburban
requirements on an urban environment. He questioned why the current construction would not
be allowed. He suggested that there is no reason to have the suburban standards required for
the UC-OD.

Mr. Neal closed the public hearing.

Ms. Cousino stated that no changes to the allowed densities were made. She stated that based
on the recommended changes, the density might change and would depend on the site and the
type of project. She stated that it is thought that the parking changes, increased setbacks, and
requirement for a public right-of-way would effectively limit the amount of density. Ms.
Cousino stated that the recommendation was that no on-street parking would count toward
parking requirements and parking should be onsite.

Mr. Chapman agrees with Mr. Richardson on the one-way street design and suggested that if
designed to Town standards it could be an enhancement. He suggested that this be considered.
He stated that he has had some issues with recent projects as he did not feel that they were not
in character with the Town. He suggested that this review and proposed changes were a step in
the right direction and it should move forward.

Mr. Brimmer stated that there has been some discussion of projects that might not be in the
right context. He stated that the UC-OD is trying to further the vision of these areas of Town,
but the context should not be lost as the urban corridor abuts residential areas, historic areas,
etc. He suggested that this was a good effort. He expressed concern with adding one-way
streets and stated that there have been areas in other parts of the country that are now
converting one-way street to two-way streets. He commended staff for their efforts.

Ms. Woods-Flowers expressed concern with one-way streets as well. She suggested that these
changes should move forward as presented in order to have them in place and functioning to
determine if any further revisions might be necessary. She commended staff as well for all of
their work and efforts.

Mr. Richardson moved for deferral of this item to the Special Planning Commission meeting scheduled for
February 27th. Mr. Bryson seconded the motion.

Mr. Neal asked Mr. Pagliarini if there are any time constraints. Mr. Pagliarini answered in the
negative and noted that the public hearing has been closed and only general comments could be
allowed at the special meeting. He noted that those Commissioners absent would not be able to
participate in discussion.

Mr. Chapman asked if deferring would cause a delay. Ms. Farrell answered that the minutes
would not be prepared in time for the regularly scheduled Planning Committee meeting and
therefore, there is a possibility that the item might not be able to be put on March Planning
Committee agenda.

Ms. Richter-Lehrman suggested that the deferral was appropriate.

Mr. Neal called for a vote on the motion. Motion passed on a 5 to 3 vote with Mr. Brimmer, Ms. Woods-
Flowers and Mr. Chapman opposed.

   Ms. Farrell asked for clarification on whether the discussion and review of the Comprehensive
   Plan should be on the special meeting agenda as previously scheduled. Mr. Neal answered in the
   affirmative.

   Ms. Woods-Flowers suggested that the changes to the UC-OD ordinance for consideration and
   further discussion should be determined and provided prior to the meeting to expedite the
   discussion at the special meeting on Feb 27th.

   Mr. Neal suggested that any items of concern be sent to staff for discussion at the meeting.

The Commission convened for a short break at 6:30 p.m. and reconvened at 6:40 p.m.

   B. IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND CONCEPTUAL PLAN APPROVAL REQUEST:
      Request approval of impact assessment and conceptual plan for Gateway Site,
      comprised of two parcels of land zoned PD, Planned Development District, and
      located on Magrath Darby Boulevard; one parcel comprising approximately 0.88
      acres and identified by TMS No. 517-00-00-092; the other parcel comprising
      approximately 4.15 acres and identified by TMS No. 517-00-00-093.

   Mr. Prause reviewed staff comments as follows:
      HISTORY
      The impact assessment document indicates the subject parcel is currently zoned Planned
      Development District with permitted uses of the AB, Areawide Business District. The
      2009-2019 Town of Mount Pleasant Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map
      recommends WG, Waterfront Gateway District, zoning for the property, but no rezoning is
      requested at this time. Hotel and office building uses are permitted uses under both zoning
      district classifications.
      PROPERTY DESCRIPTION
      Subject parcel is located on the east side of McGrath Darby Boulevard near its intersection
      with Sessions Way. It is bounded on the west by an 11.0 acre undeveloped parcel with 1.1
      acre of high ground in this developer's ownership; on the north by Best Western and
      Hampton Inn hotels; on the south by Channel 2 TV station; and on the east by McGrath
      Darby Boulevard with Harbor Point apartments beyond. Adjacent parcels are zoned under
      the same PD District zoning as the subject property.
      PROPOSAL
      Current request is for impact assessment approval to construct a 110-room hotel on the
      front portion of the property in Phase I and a 62,500 square foot office building on the rear
      portion of the property in Phase II.
      GENERAL STAFF COMMENTS
      1. Current plan indicates on-site drainage in two bioswales and a detention pond, but
          provides for potential off-site detention in an existing pond located across McGrath
          Darby Boulevard.
      2. The following Comprehensive Plan goals and strategies are identified in the Impact
          Assessment document:
          The proposed development is located on property located within the boundaries of the Waterfront
          Gateway land use, as shown the Town's Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map. The hotel and
          office building meet the recommendations of the Town's Comprehensive Plan, and will further the Town's
          objective of creating a vibrant and active project for both residents and visitors on the site. The proposed
          hotel will provide necessary accommodations to promote tourism and tourism-related industries. The
          proposed office building will help promote the growth of existing businesses and recruitment of new
          businesses.

                                                                                      February 19, 2014
                                                                                           Page 6 of 20

      Furthermore, other goals and strategies are addressed as follows:
      Implement the Town's Tourism Plan:
      Provides a hotel use in an area which provides ease of access to Patriot's Point, a significant tourist
      destination, and the Mount Pleasant Waterfront Park.
      Land Use:
      Creating development closer to the US 17 and Coleman Blvd. corridors where there is greater
      transportation infrastructure.
      Transportation:
      This site is currently located very near CARTA routes, thus promoting alternative transportation
      options.
   STAFF COMMENTS ON CONCEPTUAL PLAN
   1. The existing TV tower guy wire and easement are shown on the plan with
      documentation ensuring that there will be no conflicts with the proposed plan including
      accessibility for emergency vehicles, parking and travel aisles and building placement.
   2. Trees slated for removal and retention are identified.
   3. This is a conceptual plan. The final layout should generally conform to the conceptual
      plan; however, the final site design will be determined through the design review process.

Mr. Morrison reviewed Transportation staff comments as follows:
   TRANSPORTATION STAFF COMMENTS
   1. The traffic analysis for the proposed development assumed the following land use:
           62,500 sf general office
           110 room hotel
   The use is anticipated to generate the following New/Primary trips.
           1,529 Daily trips
           189 AM peak hour trips
           214 PM peak hour trips
   2. Primary access to this property is provided by Magrath Darby Boulevard, which has
      direct access to Johnnie Dodds Boulevard and Coleman Boulevard. A minor access
      from the site to Sessions way is also proposed.
   3. The trip distribution and background traffic was coordinated with staff. This included
      the traffic from the Bridgeside development as well as a 2% growth in background
      traffic.
   4. Staff input the proposed project trips into the QRS model and capacity spreadsheets to
      test for significance and adversity. Significance means the project trips on any link equal
      2% or more of the LOS D roadway capacity. A roadway becomes adversely affected if a
      roadway link volume does not exceed the LOS D capacity with existing and approved
      project trips, but does exceed the LOS D capacity once the project trips are added. A
      project's trips must be both significant and adverse for consideration of operational
      improvements on a specific link. The QRS model includes all previously approved
      projects so that committed demand is reflected in the analysis. The model and capacity
      spreadsheets also reflect a three year window of improvements:

   Assumed roadway improvements in the QRS model consider CHATS programmed
   improvements, the Town's CIP and other projects with a high likelihood of being
   constructed within this timeframe. These improvements are listed below with major
   capacity improvements highlighted in bold and anticipated completion dates in parentheses.

5. During the testing, no links were flagged as requiring mitigation due to significance and
   adversity testing. Significance was found on Coleman Boulevard.
6. Year 2015 AM and PM peak hour analyses were conducted to gauge the development's
   impact on critical intersections. Level of Service D is typically considered acceptable for

       two right-in/right-out only access on either side of the center access. The right-in/right-
       out only access points require that a 4' raised median be constructed on Magrath Darby
       Boulevard in order to effectively enforce the turn restrictions. A review of SCDOT
       warrants for both left and right-turn lanes indicates these improvements are not
       required.

Mr. Neal asked if the access to Sessions Way would be two-way. Mr. Morrison answered in the
affirmative. Mr. Prause answered that there is the possibility for an additional access as noted in
staff comments. Mr. Morrison answered that this additional access would not affect the daily
trips.

Mr. Chapman asked when the funding of improvements would be determined. Mr. Morrison
answered that the developer should contribute to mitigation just as other developments in the
Waterfront Gateway area will, but he does not have a timeframe as to when this would be
accomplished.

Mr. Richardson asked about impacts to the intersections for future development and if they
would participate in the intersection improvements. Mr. Morrison answered in the affirmative
and state they would be captured in the allocation. Mr. Richardson asked if this would be a
contribution to impact fees. Mr. Morrison answered in the negative and stated that it would be
in addition to impact fees.

Mr. Jason Ward, representative, reviewed the request with the Commission.

Mr. Neal asked about the guide wires going through the parking lot. Mr. Ward answered that
there is a high wire and mid wire. He stated that they have conducted a survey and would be
meeting the SCDOT requirements. Mr. Neal asked what the height requirements were. Mr.
Ward answered that it would be approximately 18 feet. He stated that the Fire Department does
not have an issue and the TV station has been made aware of the project and they are in favor.
Mr. Neal asked about landscaping around the anchors. Mr. Ward answered that this would be
accomplished. Mr. Neal asked about contribution to allocation. Mr. Ward answered that they
are amenable to participating as required so that the project can come to fruition.

Mr. Chapman asked if the applicant would be amenable to having a left signal at the Magrath
Darby/Coleman Blvd intersection. Mr. Ward asked if this this would mean funding the left turn
signal and if impact credits could be issued. Mr. Chapman answered in the affirmative and
stated that this was included in the impact assessment.

Mr. Morrison stated that the signal would not be impact credit available and would be a few
thousand dollars to add the turn signal.

Ms. Woods-Flowers asked if this could be conditioned with the approval and that all of the
ramifications are considered.

Mr. Brimmer asked if there is a sidewalk on the project side of Magrath Darby Blvd. Mr. Ward
answered in the negative and stated that a sidewalk is located on the other side of Magrath
Darby.

Mr. Neal asked for clarification on staff's recommendation in relation to the applicant
participating in the allocation of cost for future improvements and what staff would recommend
in regard to the interim solution of the turn signal that Mr. Chapman suggested. Mr. Morrison
answered that an analysis would have to be completed to determine if the turn signal at Magrath
Darby/Coleman Blvd intersection would be a good interim solution. He stated that if the
improvement caused a drop in the LOS, then the signal would not be installed, but if it would
improve conditions, then it could be a good solution.

Mr. Richardson moved for approval of the request including all staff comments, with the condition of the
installation of a left turn signal extension at Magrath Darby/Coleman Blvd intersection at the discretion of the
Town Transportation Engineer. Mr. Chapman seconded the motion. All in favor.

C. REZONING REQUEST ­ PUBLIC HEARING: Request to remove from the UC-
   CBS, Coleman Boulevard-Ben Sawyer Boulevard Urban Corridor Overlay District, an
   approximately 2.10 acre portion of the common area of Simmons Pointe (such
   portion containing the entrance drive and amenity area), located at 1551 Ben Sawyer
   Boulevard and identified as a portion of TMS No. 532-15-00-134.

Mr. Richardson recused himself due to a conflict of interest.

Ms. Cousino reviewed staff comments as follows:
   HISTORY
   The Simmons Pointe Planned Development District was originally established in 1984, and
   has been amended twice in 1987 and 1992. The PD ordinance allows for detached single-
   family and multi-family residential uses. The 2005 Coleman Boulevard ­ Ben Sawyer
   Boulevard Revitalization Plan included properties on Ben Sawyer Boulevard, including the
   front portion of Simmons Pointe. While the 2007 Coleman Revitalization Advisory Board
   (CRAB) Report did not include specific recommendations for re/development of properties
   on Ben Sawyer, it did contain, as exhibits, a map of the plan area which included Ben
   Sawyer, as well as the 2005 Plan. The original CBS-OD, Coleman-Ben Sawyer Boulevard
   Overlay District, included Simmons Pointe and other properties along Ben Sawyer
   Boulevard. The boundaries of the Overlay District did not change when the CBS-OD was
   replaced by the UC-OD, Urban Corridor Overlay District.
   PROPERTY DESCRIPTION
   Subject parcel is located on the southwest side of Ben Sawyer Boulevard, past its intersection
   with unimproved Baytree Drive. It is bounded on the north by an undeveloped parcel
   located at 1543 Ben Sawyer Boulevard and zoned AB, Areawide Business District, and UC-
   CBS, Coleman Boulevard-Ben Sawyer Boulevard Urban Corridor Overlay District; on the
   east by Ben Sawyer Boulevard; on the south by Sawyers Landing, a residential development
   zoned AB and UC-CBS; and on the west by the remainder of Simmons Pointe.
   PROPOSAL
   The current request is to remove the front portion of Simmons Pointe from the UC-CBS,
   such portion being an approximately 2.10 acre portion of the common area containing the
   entrance drive and amenity area.
                                                             DRAFT MINUTES ­ Planning Commission
                                                                                 February 19, 2014
                                                                                     Page 10 of 20

   STAFF COMMENTS
   1. The applicant included a letter with the application explaining the reason for the request,
       which is to make the zoning consistent over the entire development.
   2. Including the property in the UC-CBS will provide a consistent streetscape should the
       property ever be redeveloped; however, since the property contains the amenity area for
       Simmons Pointe there are no redevelopment plans at this time.
   3. Removal of the entrance drive and amenity area of Simmons Pointe from the UC-CBS
       will affect the two adjacent properties, known as Sawyers Landing and 1543 Ben Sawyer
       Boulevard. Certain height limitations and bufferyard requirements apply when a parcel in
       the UC-CBS abuts residential property located outside the overlay district: height is
       limited to 40 feet within 50 feet of an abutting residential property line, when such
       abutting residential property is located outside the UC-CBS; and a minimum 15-foot
       setback and 10-foot Type C buffer with a 6-foot wood stockade fence is required. These
       requirements do not currently apply to the shared side property lines between Simmons
       Pointe and the adjacent parcels since that portion of Simmons Pointe is located in the
       UC-CBS.
   4. Sawyers Landing is built; however, the developer is permitted to build up to two
       additional units on the property, which will be located closer to Simmons Pointe than
       the existing building. The property at 1543 Ben Sawyer Boulevard is undeveloped, but
       has a vested sketch plan approval. If Simmons Pointe is removed from the UC-CBS,
       future homeowners in the adjacent developments would be subject to the provisions of
       Section 156.130 et seq. which provides certain limits on renovations and replacement of
       nonconforming structures.
   5. The owner of 1543 Ben Sawyer Boulevard submitted a rezoning request that appears as
       Agenda Item 4k. Should this item be approved, Staff Comments #3 and #4 will not
       apply to the development of that property.
   RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
   The Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map recommends High Density Neighborhood
   land uses for all of Simmons Pointe.

Mr. Neal asked about Sawyer's Landing and if there is a vested sketch plan. Ms. Cousino
answered that staff would have to research this to verify if it is still vested. Mr. Neal asked if
removing the property from Urban Corridor could affect this property. Mr. Cousino answered
in the affirmative.

Mr. David Shimp, applicant, reviewed the request with the Commission.

Mr. John Collins, HOA president, suggested that the remaining lots in Sawyer's Landing have
been absorbed by the HOA and would not be developed. He stated that the desire is to have
the entire development under one zoning so that the character of Simmons Pointe can be
preserved. He expressed concern with traffic issues and that if future development is allowed
under the Urban Corridor density allowances, the traffic congestion would increase.

Mr. Neal asked if Mr. Collins represents all of Simmons Pointe. Mr. Collins answered in the
affirmative and stated that Simmons Pointe II is within Simmons Pointe.

Mr. Neal closed the public hearing.

Mr. Neal asked what the benefits would be and if there is an issue with not having contiguity for
the Urban Corridor. Ms. Cousino answered that one reason for having the Urban Corridor was
to have a consistent streetscape and removing this property would break that contiguity.
                                                                  DRAFT MINUTES ­ Planning Commission

                                                                                          Page 11 of 20


Mr. Chapman moved for approval. Mr. Siegrist seconded the motion.

Mr. Chapman suggested that this was another amendment similar to what is being
recommended for UC-OD ordinance.

Mr. Neal asked if the property were sold, what implications would there be if not in Urban
Corridor. Ms. Cousino answered that it is zoned planned development and are allowed 91 units
with 90 units having been built to date, so if additional units were desired, they would have to
request an amendment to the planned development. She stated that the underlying zoning
determines which uses are allowed. Mr. Neal expressed concern with one owner making the
request and not hearing from others and that this might affect those residents as well as abutting
neighborhoods.

Ms. Woods-Flowers stated that she does not have concern with the application, but as a
horizontal property regime, there might be some issue with that portion of the property having a
different zoning classification.

Mr. Neal called for a vote on the motion. Motion passed on a 5 to 2 vote, with Mr. Bryson and Mr. Neal
opposed and Mr. Richardson abstaining.

D. ZONING REQUEST ­ PUBLIC HEARING: Request to zone AB, Areawide
   Business District, an approximately 0.632 acre parcel of land located at 1135 Chuck
   Dawley Boulevard and identified by TMS No. 532-08-00-099.

F. PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL REQUEST: Request approval of preliminary
   plat for Tidal Walk (formerly known as Seacoast Parkway Residential), a
   development containing 119 detached single-family residential lots zoned PD,
   Planned Development District, to be located on an approximately 45.76 acre parcel
   of land located at the terminus of Seacoast Parkway and identified by TMS No. 537-
   00-00-090.

Mr. Mitchell reviewed staff comments as follows:
   HISTORY
   The subject property is part of the Belle Hall Planned Development District (PD). The PD
   was amended in July 2013 to allow for the development of the property as a detached single-
   family residential subdivision. An impact assessment and sketch plan were approved by
   Town Council in June 2013.
   PROPERTY DESCRIPTION
   The subject property is located at the end of Seacoast Parkway, between I-526 and the
   Grassy Creek subdivision.
   PROPOSAL
   The current request is for preliminary plat approval.
   STAFF COMMENTS
   1. Conditions of approval of the PD amendment primarily pertained to the sketch plan, and
      all conditions have been addressed with the current submittal. One such condition is the
      installation of a 10-foot planted buffer where lots in Tidal Walk back up to lots in Grassy
      Creek. This buffer is located adjacent to an existing 10-foot SCE&G easement. This
      buffer is located outside the individual lots on HOA property. The plat includes a note
      that this buffer is required, but a more detailed note should be included on the final plat.
      The note should indicate the following: that the buffer is required as a condition of
      approval of the neighborhood, ownership and maintenance responsibility, and what is
      permitted in terms of removal and replacement of vegetation.
   2. A total of 5.71 acres of open space is proposed, most of which is contained within the
      buffer adjacent to I-526. The plat indicates that 8% open space is required, which is
      actually more than what is required by Section 155.073 (B). Proposed open space totals
      approximately 12.5% of the total project acreage. A pedestrian trail is provided through
                                                                    DRAFT MINUTES ­ Planning Commission

            the buffer along I-526 and serves to connect the amenity area with the HOA area along
            the marsh.
       3.   A total of 26 significant and historic trees are proposed for removal, 16 of which are
            identified as gum trees. Applicant proposes 100% replacement of all inches removed,
            even though replacement (mitigation) may not be required for the gum trees, depending
            on the particular species. Most trees are multi-stem; only one single stem historic tree (a
            sycamore) is proposed for removal. A tree planting plan was not submitted; however, a
            note on the checklist submitted by the applicant indicates that street trees will be planted
            to satisfy the replacement requirements, in addition to existing trees located in HOA
            areas.
       4.   The critical line has not yet been certified by OCRM; however, a change to the critical line
            could potentially have a minimal effect on only Lots 17 & 18 and the HOA area around
            Pond #5.
       5.   Street names have been approved by Charleston County. Addresses must be shown on
            the final plat.
       6.   A supplemental staff report addressing minor staff comments has been provided to the
            applicant.

   Mr. Neal asked about buffers between Grassy Creek and this property. Ms. Cousino answered
   that there is a ten foot SCE&G buffer and the planned development includes an additional ten
   foot buffer where the property abuts residential lots in Grassy Creek.

   Mr. Chapman asked about the sidewalks and if they are required on both sides. Mr. Mitchell
   answered that they are not required to have sidewalks on both sides and noted that there is a
   pedestrian path through the buffer adjacent to I-526.

   Mr. Siegrist asked about the width of the buffer between I-526 and Grassy Creek. Ms. Jenny
   Gilreath, Seamon Whiteside, answered that it was reduced to 65 feet from 75 feet. Mr. Siegrist
   asked the grade level of the properties in relation to I-526. Ms. Gilreath answered that the
   highway is higher than the property grade level.

   Mr. Neal asked if the request complies with all buffer requirements. Mr. Mitchell answered in
   the affirmative.

   Mr. Chapman moved for approval including all staff comments. Mr. Richardson seconded the motion. All in
   favor.

The Commission convened for a short break at 8:00 p.m. and reconvened at 8:12 p.m.

   G. PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL REQUEST: Request approval of preliminary
      plat for Tributary Phase 3 (formerly known as Preservation Row), a development
      containing 22 detached single-family residential lots zoned PD, Planned
      Development District, to be located on an approximately 4.94 acre tract of land,
      located along Rivertowne Parkway, and identified as portions of TMS Nos. 583-05-
      00-107 and 583-05-00-111.

   Mr. Mitchell reviewed staff comments as follows:
      HISTORY

    phases. The current request is for preliminary plat approval for Phase III containing 22
    lots. This is the final phase of development.
    PROPERTY DESCRIPTION
    This development is comprised of a portion of two parcels of land, totaling approximately
    4.94 acres. The parcels are located on Rivertowne Parkway near its intersection with
    Highway 41.
    PROPOSAL
    Current request is for approval of the preliminary plat for 22 single-family detached lots,
    dedication of public roads, dedication of public storm drain system, and .53 acres of open
    space. Also requested is approval for the following road names: Brocket Lane, Grange Hill
    Lane, and Bentic Way.
    STAFF COMMENTS
    1. Lots and street layout shown on the preliminary plat generally conform to the approved
         sketch plan with the exceptions noted below:
         o The addition of Brocket Lane
         o An alignment adjustment to Grange Hill Ln.
         o Change in the lot configuration on Grange Hill Ln.
         o An adjustment to Bentic Way resulting in an extra parcel of remnant space to be
             used as HOA space.
    2. A supplemental staff report addressing minor staff comments has been provided to the
         applicant.

Mr. Neal asked about the change to the lot on Grange Hill Lane. Ms. Cousino answered that
the HOA property at the end of the street was originally part of a lot, but it has been separated
so that there can be additional open space.

Mr. Jimmy DuPre, Thomas & Hutton, reviewed the request with the Commission and stated
that this is the last phase of the development. Mr. Neal asked if the lot above the alley would be
HOA property. Mr. DuPre answered in the affirmative.

All in favor.

H. PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL REQUEST: Request approval of preliminary
   plat for a portion of the Primary Connector Road in the Central Mount Pleasant
   Planned Development District, to be known as Rivella Drive, located between
   Midtown Avenue and Rifle Range Road, and located on a portion of TMS No. 560-
   00-00-030.

Mr. Mitchell reviewed staff comments as follows:
   HISTORY
   Subject parcel is part of the Central Mount Pleasant Development Agreement adopted on
   May 17, 2007.
   The Development Agreement was amended on Dec 12, 2012 with a revised Sketch Plan.
   The road is a primary collector and serves as an important vehicular link between Rifle
   Range Road and Midtown Avenue. It is an integral part of the development plan. The May
   2007 DA required the roadway to be completed within three years of completion of
   Hungryneck Boulevard Phase 2B, with a one (1) year extension allowance. The 2012 DA
   Amendment clarified that the completion date of Hungryneck Phase 2B was August 31,
   2010 and did not change the one (1) year extension allowance. This is the first section
   proposed for construction. At the end of this month, the developer will have six months
                                                                    DRAFT MINUTES ­ Planning Commission
                                                                                        February 19, 2014
                                                                                            Page 16 of 20

    remaining to complete the roadway connection with Rifle Range Road as specified in the
    DA of 2012.
    PROPOSAL
    Applicant is proposing to construct a variable width right of way approximately 500 linear
    feet for access to the Haven Apartment Complex. The Haven Apartments are currently
    under construction and this will be the primary access.
    STAFF COMMENTS
    1. The alignment conforms to the Sketch Plan alignment and satisfies the multi-modal use.
    2. Recommend radius of right of way at the intersection to be increased to 20 feet.
    3. Recommend providing a geo-technical study and pavement design for the roadway
        section.
    4. Providing a drainage easement from the roadway to the outfall channel.
    5. Town Transportation Department final review on intersection design.

Mr. Bryan Brooks, Thomas & Hutton, reviewed the request with the Commission. He stated
that due to protected wildlife, the roadway construction needed to be broken into two phases,
with the second phase beginning in May after the eagle's nest is vacated.

Mr. Chapman asked if a ten-foot path was approved and suggested that this should be done due
to pedestrian and child safety, particularly with children travelling to and from school. Mr.
Mitchell showed a road section representation to the Commission and stated that this was the
most recent design approved, which contains an 8-foot multi-use path. Mr. Brooks expressed
concern with widening the multi-use path as it might encourage golf carts. He confirmed that
the width of the path does not decrease as it approaches the intersection.

Mr. Richardson moved for approval of the request. Mr. Siegrist seconded the motion. All in favor.

I. LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS EXCEPTION REQUEST: Request
   exception from Land Development Regulations Section 155.047 (C) (8) for Wando
   Park Residential, a duplex residential development zoned PD, Planned Development
   District, to be located on an approximately 1.05 acre parcel of land, located at 916
   Wando Park Boulevard, and identified by TMS No. 540-00-00-152

Mr. Prause reviewed staff comments as follows:
   HISTORY
   The subject parcel is part of the original Belle Hall Planned Development District ordinance
   adopted in 1988, which has been amended numerous times. The most recent and relevant
   amendment occurred last month amending the PD district zoning allowing duplex uses for
   the property.
   PROPERTY DESCRIPTION
   Subject parcel is comprised of an approximately 1.05 acre tract of land consisting of 0.99
   acres of high land and 0.06 acres of tidally influenced wetlands located at 916 Wando Park
   Boulevard adjacent to Woodfield Apartments and identified by TMS No. 540-00-00-152.
   PROPOSAL
   Current request is to subdivide the property into four duplex lots with angular side lot lines
   in contravention to the requirement for perpendicular side lot lines on lots abutting a straight
   street section.
   STAFF COMMENTS
   1. Land Development Regulations Section 155.047 (C)(8) provides in relevant portion that
       "insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines ... ."
                                                                  DRAFT MINUTES ­ Planning Commission
                                                                                      February 19, 2014
                                                                                          Page 17 of 20

    2. Section 155.047 (A)(2) provides that, "in cases of extreme hardship (i.e., unavoidable
       topographical constraints), the Planning Commission can allow adjustments to the
       following criteria as necessary."
    3. The Planning Commission has the authority to allow an adjustment to the standard and
       may find it beneficial to do so in that while the subject lot is situated on a straight street
       section the parent lot is not oriented with side lot lines at right angles to the street
       section, but rather is somewhat of a triangle. Allowing the modification will allow a
       better right angle initial approach to each lot for access and front yard parking.

Mr. Neal asked if the Commission would see this project after this request. Mr. Prause answered
in the negative. Mr. Neal asked about the adjacent properties and if interconnectivity could be
accomplished with these properties. Mr. Prause answered that connectivity might be possible,
but would not be known until the adjacent property was being developed. He stated that a
shared access could not be guaranteed.

Mr. Brimmer asked about the road to the rear of the property. Mr. Prause answered that it is the
old Rat Hall Road. He stated that there is a ditch at the rear of the property that is tidal. Ms.
Cousino answered that the roadway was abandoned when Wando Park Blvd was constructed.

Mr. Giles Branch, Earthsource Engineering, reviewed the request with the Commission. He
stated that there has been discussion with the adjacent property owners regarding
interconnectivity and they would be willing to provide an access easement for future
interconnectivity.

Mr. Neal suggested that a spur from the private drive would be desirable. Mr. Richardson
agreed and suggested that there might be opportunity for better structure alignment. Mr. Neal
asked if they could be alley-served. Mr. Branch answered that it would encroach into the critical
areas.

Mr. Siegrist asked if the road would be private. Mr. Branch answered in the affirmative. Mr.
Siegrist asked about the open space between the roadway and Wando Park Blvd. Mr. Branch
answered that it would be landscaped HOA property.

Mr. Richardson asked how trash pickup would be handled. Mr. Branch answered that trash
pickup would be from Wando Park Blvd. Mr. Mitchell answered that pickup from the private
drive could be considered and would be determined at final plat. He stated that they would have
to ensure protection of the Town from maintenance/repair issues.

Mr. Chapman moved for approval on the condition that the developer meet all staff requirements. Mr. Brimmer
seconded the motion. All in favor.

Ms. Cousino reviewed staff comments as follows:
   HISTORY
   The subject parcel is zoned AB, Areawide Business District, and UC-CBS, Coleman
   Boulevard-Ben Sawyer Boulevard Urban Corridor Overlay District. In October 2013, the
   Planning Commission approved a sketch plan for the property that reflected a total of 21
   dwelling units (attached and detached single-family).
   PROPERTY DESCRIPTION
   Subject parcel is located on the southwest side of Ben Sawyer Boulevard, at its intersection
   with unimproved Baytree Drive. It is bounded on the north by the Baytree Drive right-of-
   way; on the east by Ben Sawyer Boulevard; and on the south and west by Simmons Pointe,
   zoned PD, Planned Development District.
   PROPOSAL
   The current request is to amend the Comprehensive Plan by changing the Future Land Use
   Map designation from Urban Corridor to High Density Neighborhood; to rezone the
   property to PD, Planned Development District; and to remove the property from the UC-
   CBS.
   STAFF COMMENTS
   1. The request is to become part of the Simmons Pointe Planned Development District,
       with permitted uses and development standards as outlined in the application as Exhibit
       A.
   2. Permitted uses are limited to detached single-family dwellings and accessory uses.
   3. Proposed minimum lot size is 2,000 square feet, with a minimum width of 24 feet and a
       minimum depth of 50 feet. Minimum yard requirements (setbacks) are as follows: front
       yard, 4 feet; side yard, 3 feet; and rear yard, 10 feet. Proposed setbacks are intended to
       apply to both principal and accessory structures. Building coverage is limited to 75%.
   4. Roads are proposed to be private, which is the case with all roads in Simmons Pointe.
   5. Section 156.226 of the Town's Tree Protection Ordinance requires a Tree Protection
       Zone (TPZ) to be established around each protected tree. "Such protection zone shall
       consist of a circular area centered around the tree, the diameter of which is equal to one
       foot for each inch of DBH measurement." Section 156.226 (A) (6) further provides that
       Planning staff may allow or require modifications to the TPZ based on site conditions or
       other factors.
   6. Reductions to the required size of the TPZ are proposed for two specific trees located at
       the front of the property.
       a. Tree #1 contains seven stems (trunks), totaling approximately 113" DBH. The TPZ
            for Tree #1 is proposed to consist of a 30-foot radius around approximately two-
            thirds of the tree.
       b. Tree #2 contains three stems (trunks), totaling approximately 58" DBH. The TPZ
            for Tree #2 is proposed to consist of a circular area centered around the tree, the
            diameter of which is equal to one foot for each two inches of DBH measurement.
   RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
   The Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map recommends Urban Corridor land uses for
   the subject property. Current request is to change this designation to High Density
   Neighborhood, which has a corresponding density of 9 units per acre. On this 1.31 acre
   parcel, this yields a maximum of 11 dwelling units.

Mr. Neal closed the public hearing.

Mr. Neal stated that this parcel is adjacent to the Simmons Pointe parcel that was considered
earlier and asked if the developer has agreement with the adjacent property owners. Mr. John
                                                                  DRAFT MINUTES ­ Planning Commission

Popelka, property owner, answered in the negative and stated that he is still in discussion with
the adjacent property owners. Mr. Neal asked if there are any issues with the lower property
line. Mr. Popelka answered that the previous request could affect the setbacks for that area.

Mr. Chapman moved for deferral. Ms. Richter-Lehrman seconded the motion.

Mr. Neal asked if there are any time issues with deferral. Mr. Pagliarini answered in the negative.

Mr. Neal called for a vote on the motion. Motion passed on a 6 to 1 vote, with Mr. Bryson opposed and Mr.
Richardson abstaining.

K. PLANNED DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT REQUEST ­ PUBLIC HEARING:
   Request to amend the Pepper Tract Planned Development District Ordinance (Ord.
   No. 11048, as amended) by rezoning from RC, Rural Commercial District, to CDSF,
   Cluster Development Single Family District, an approximately 2.35 acre portion of an
   approximately 101.21 acre parcel of land located along Tupelo Forest Drive and
   identified by TMS No. 615-00-00-044 and by rezoning from CDSF District to RC
   District, an approximately 0.41 acre portion of the aforementioned parcel of land.

Ms. Cousino reviewed staff comments as follows:
   HISTORY
   The Pepper Tract was annexed and zoned PD-CD in July 2011. Approximately 75 acres
   were included in the CDSF, Cluster Development Single Family District. Development of
   the CDSF District has been ongoing since the beginning of 2012. Home construction is
   underway in Phase 1. Approximately 33.5 acres were included in the RC, Rural Commercial
   District, though the PD limits total commercial development to 195,000 square feet. The PD
   also includes an Institutional District, which is comprised of approximately 39 acres. An
   impact assessment was completed only for the residential units; an additional impact
   assessment(s) must be approved prior to development of any new commercial or
   institutional uses. In November 2013, an approximately 10.55 acre portion of the RC
   District was rezoned to CDSF District.
   PROPOSAL
   The current request is to rezone an approximately 2.35 acre portion of the RC District to
   CDSF District and to rezone an approximately 0.41 acre portion of the CDSF District to RC
   District. The developer intends to use approximately 0.73 acres for a neighborhood amenity
   center, with the remaining acreage to be developed as approximately fifty single-family lots.
   A conceptual layout is included on the revised Pepper Tract Zoning Plan.
   STAFF COMMENTS
   1. Overall density for the Pepper Tract PD-CD will stay the same. The PD is limited to one
       unit per acre, or a total of 313 dwelling units.
   2. Sketch plans and/or preliminary plats have been approved for Phases 1 through 4 of the
       CDSF District. These plans reflect a total of 224 dwelling units, leaving a total of 89
       dwelling units available.
   3. Development standards for the CDSF District will apply.
   4. All of the Institutional District acreage remains (approx. 39 acres). If this PD
       amendment is approved, approximately 21 acres of RC District will remain. No changes
       are proposed to the total square footage of development allowed in the RC District
       (195,000 square feet).
   RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
   The following list of applicable Comprehensive Plan goals and strategies is provided so that
   they may be considered along with this zoning request:
                                                                     DRAFT MINUTES ­ Planning Commission

                                                                                             Page 20 of 20

       1. Encourage appropriate commercial development to increase the property tax base and
          minimize the tax burden on homeowners.
       2. Encourage the location of workplaces and educational facilities in close proximity to
          concentrations of residential development to provide convenient access from home to
          work.
       3. Guide development in rural areas to reflect rural characteristics and densities.
       4. Provide a mix of housing types in a variety of price ranges, including rental housing
          options, to meet the needs of the wide range of Town residents and workforce and to
          promote Mount Pleasant as a lifelong community.

   Mr. Neal closed the public hearing.

   Mr. Chapman moved for approval including all staff comments. Mr. Richardson seconded the motion. All in
   favor.

      be located at the terminus of Jane Jacobs Street on a portion of TMS No. 535-06-00-
      652.

   Mr. Mitchell reviewed staff comments as follows:
      HISTORY
      The original sketch plan shows this area as residential lots. An amended Sketch Plan in 2009
      shows this area as vacant, with these lots removed. The development reached the maximum
      number of lots allowed per the PD Ordinance and was unable to continue with this phase,
      Phase 11.
      PROPERTY DESCRIPTION
      Subject property is located just past the current terminus of Jane Jacobs Street, adjacent to
      existing Lot 11-2.
      PROPOSAL
      Due to the recent aggregation of two lots into one, the owner is requesting this lot be
      approved within this area under a new Sketch Plan for Phase 11 and Preliminary Plat.
      STAFF COMMENTS
      1. Infrastructure, for the exception of the road and drainage system, has been
          installed. Applicant is requesting Jane Jacobs Street be extended to provide for the lot
          frontage needed along a public street per PD Ordinance.
      2. Engineering comments were previously provided.

   Mr. Neal asked if the dwelling unit maximum is 762. Mr. Mitchell answered in the affirmative.

§ 156.329 UC-OD, URBAN CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT.

  (A) Boundary of the district. The boundary of the district is graphically depicted in the following
Figure 1.




                        Figure 1. Boundary of Urban Corridor Overlay District.

 (B) Purpose.

    (1) The purpose of the district is to implement the recommendations of the Town Comprehensive
Plan 2009-2019 by fostering an active, pedestrian-oriented commercial environment with a variety of
uses, activities, and scales; where form is as important as use, with buildings and primary entrances
located near the public realm and high-quality pedestrian streetscapes in front. An emphasis should be
placed upon a high degree of design quality for the building facade and a strong interaction between the


                                                                                                  Page 1 of 39
                                                                                DRAFT UC-OD Text Amendments
                                                           Draft for Planning Commission Public Hearing 02.19.14

buildings and the public realm. Public spaces, such as plazas, should be integrated with surrounding
development.

    (2) This focus on the public realm is a fundamental tenet of form-based zoning codes. The Town
Comprehensive Plan 2009-2019 recommends the use of form-based codes as a way to provide for more
flexibility in the development or redevelopment of property, which serves to make the town more
competitive from an economic development standpoint. Form-based codes address the relationship
between building facades and the public realm, and regulate the form and mass of buildings, while
allowing the market to dictate the internal use(s) of the building. Form-based codes also encourage
construction of sustainable buildings that can adapt over time to changing uses.

    (3) The Town Comprehensive Plan 2009-2019 recommends that higher density development occur
in the southern area of town, and that the town promote appropriate infill and redevelopment in the
urban core. Providing opportunities for higher density development in the urban core serves to reduce
sprawl and preserve rural areas.

    (4) This triangular-shaped area, which is bounded on the west by the Ravenel Bridge, on the east by
I-526, on the north by Johnnie Dodds Boulevard, and on the south by Coleman and Chuck Dawley
Boulevards, represents the core of the southern end of town. It is planned to be developed and re-
developed into the urban core of the town, with an emphasis on mixed use commercial and residential
development in a pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly, walkable style of development. The most public uses,
such as retail sales, should be located on the first floor, with more private uses, such as residential and
office uses, on upper floors. Appropriate development form includes taller buildings, higher density
residential use, and compact development with multimodal access.

    (5) Because the triangle is bisected by Shem Creek, with no cross-access along its length, this
"loop" will serve as a primary transit corridor for the urban core. Redevelopment of these corridors
should facilitate multimodal access, comprising pedestrian, bicycle, and mass transit-type modes of
transportation, including buses and shuttle service.

    (6) Buildings are encouraged to achieve national green building certification, such as but not
limited to, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).

 (C) Definitions.

   ACTIVITY ZONE. The area located between the street right-of-way and the build-to line, which
may be utilized for pedestrian-friendly uses, such as but not limited to, streetside dining, entertainment,
pushcarts, or outdoor display of merchandise. [move to 156.007]

    FLOOR AREA RATIO (FAR). Expresses the relationship between the amount of useable floor area
permitted in a building or buildings and the area of the lot on which the building stands. It is obtained by
dividing the gross floor area of a building by the total area of the lot. The diagram below illustrates three
ways that a FAR of 1.0 might be achieved: a one-story building covering the entire lot, a two-story
building covering half the lot, or a four-story building covering one quarter of the lot. [move to 156.007]




                                                                                                    Page 2 of 39

  INTERNAL ACCESS ROADS. A vehicular travel way that runs perpendicular to the main boulevard
streets, which may or may not connect to another public street that has the appearance and function of,
but not necessarily the construction standards of, a dedicated public street.

  OUTDOOR DINING. These areas shall be located outside of the activity zone and may be open to
the elements and temporarily enclosed by means such as fencing, walls, plastic, or other enclosing
materials and methods due to weather. [move to 156.007]

  PUSHCART. A non-self-propelled vehicle designed to be readily moveable, from which merchandise
or food is sold. [move to 156.007]

 SINGLE USE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. A development containing only residential uses.
Such uses may be mixed product types (e.g., multi-family dwelling units and attached single-family
dwelling units).

  STREETSIDE DINING. These areas shall be located within the activity zone, and are specifically
required to be open air, unconditioned dining, open to the elements and not enclosed by any means, such
as fencing, walls, plastic, or other enclosing materials and methods; except that awnings shall be
allowed. Temporary planters for landscaping may be used to delineate the dining area, but may not
impede pedestrian access. [move to 156.007]

 (D C) Design review process/development standards.

    (1) All development within the UC-OD shall be subject to the CDR-OD, Commercial Design
Review Overlay District, process as provided in § 156.327 this chapter. However, in order to achieve
the goals of the UC-OD, when in conflict, the site development requirements as set forth in this section
shall take precedence over those found within the CDR-OD.

    (2) The development standards shall be specified within this overlay district, as applicable. Where
not so modified, the development standards of the underlying district classification, or as otherwise
already provided by other standards, shall apply. Such modification will maintain the following
hierarchy when in conflict: the specific requirements of the UC-OD shall apply first; second in
application shall be specific requirements of Planned Development District zoning; third in application
shall be CDR-OD requirements; and finally the requirements of the underlying zoning district or other
applicable zoning district standards and land development regulations.

  (E D) Permitted uses/overlay district. As an overlay district, permitted uses shall be those of the
underlying zoning district classification, as modified herein.


                                                                                                   Page 3 of 39

                                                          Draft for Planning Commission Public Hearing 02.19.14

    (1) A mixture of commercial and residential uses is encouraged overall. This mixed use may
include separate commercial use buildings and residential dwellings on the same property, as well as
commercial and residential uses in the same building. In order to facilitate the mixture of commercial
and residential uses in the same building, residential uses may occur on the street level or any building
level containing commercial uses.

    (2) All residentially-zoned parcels are limited to single-use residential development. Densities shall
be as specified in this section.

    (3 2) In order to accommodate any type of commercial or mixed use, the underlying zoning district
of a property must be commercial.

    (4) These uses may be allowed without requirement of a minimum lot size. However, a primary
goal is to provide incentives to encourage the aggregation of multiple smaller parcels and to promote a
more effective utilization of larger parcels in creating well designed projects, connected and unified in
design and function. The maximum benefit allowed by these provisions will result from such
aggregation of properties, and their utilization will prove impractical without the same.
[moved to 156.329 (F)]

    (5) In order to encourage the most efficient use of a site, single-family residential dwelling units
(including detached single-family houses, duplex dwelling units, and residential townhouses) may be
allowed without such units having frontage on a public street.

   (6 3) Residential uses located on commercially-zoned any parcels in the UC-OD are subject to the
density requirements of the UC-OD.

   (4) Permitted uses for residentially-zoned properties are:

     (a) Detached single-family dwellings, provided such dwellings do not front the boulevards or
frontage roads;

     (b) Duplex dwellings;

     (c) Townhouse dwellings, with no restriction on the number of units within a single building or
length of individual rows of townhouse dwelling units;

     (d) Multi-family dwellings;

     (e) Permitted and conditional uses as provided in the PI-1 District, subject to their applicable
requirements and approval processes; and

     (f) Accessory uses, except Accessory Dwelling Units.

   (7 5) Specifically allowed Permitted uses for commercially-zoned properties are:

     (a) Detached single-family dwellings units, provided such dwellings units do not front the
boulevards or frontage roads;

     (b) Duplex dwellings units;

                                                                                                   Page 4 of 39

                                                          Draft for Planning Commission Public Hearing 02.19.14


      (c) Residential Townhouses dwellings, with no restriction on the number of units within a single
building or length of individual rows of townhouse dwelling units;

     (d) Multi-family dwellings units;

      (e) Permitted, conditional, and special exception uses as provided in the OP, NC, AB, CO, and
PI-1 Districts, including conditional and special exception uses and outdoor and streetside dining subject
to their applicable requirements and approval processes.

      1.(f) Permitted, conditional, and special exception uses as provided in the AB-2 District,
including conditional and special exception uses and outdoor and streetside dining, will be allowed only
when the underlying zoning of a parcel is AB-2, and provided further that conditional and special
exception uses are subject to their applicable requirements and approval processes.

       2. Conditional and special exception uses are subject to their applicable requirements and
approval processes.

    3. (g) Outdoor and streetside dining uses, including the sale and consumption of alcoholic
beverages, will shall be a permitted use in all underlying commercial use districts, provided the
conditions specified in the underlying use district have been met.

   (h) Accessory uses, except Accessory Dwelling Units.

   (8 i) Any combination of the aforementioned uses.

  (F E) Open space. No open space is required, but is strongly encouraged in the form of parks, plazas,
and public gathering places.

   (F) Minimum lot size. There is no minimum lot size; however, a primary goal of the UC-OD is to
provide incentives to encourage the aggregation of multiple smaller parcels and to promote a more
effective utilization of larger parcels for mixed use in creating well designed projects, connected and
unified in design and function. The maximum benefit allowed by the provisions of this section will
result from such aggregation of properties, and their utilization will prove impractical without the
same.
[moved from 156.329 (E) (4)]

  (G) Floor area ratio. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) allowed is 1.5. Parking structures shall
not be included in FAR calculations. FAR shall not apply to detached single-family dwellings.

  (H) Incentives. The development intensity of each district varies with the allowed building height.
To achieve the desired aesthetic goals, zoning incentives are necessary to aggregate smaller properties to
create "blocks" for development, where taller buildings and parking structures are utilized.

    (1) Incentives cumulative. The incentives provided herein are cumulative. By way of example,
FAR may be increased to 1.9 if a nonresidential development is located on a minimum of four acres and
park area is provided (1.5 FAR plus 0.2 FAR for a minimum acreage plus 0.2 FAR for park area equals
1.9 FAR).


                                                                                                   Page 5 of 39
                                                                                DRAFT UC-OD Text Amendments
                                                           Draft for Planning Commission Public Hearing 02.19.14

   (2) FAR increases allowed. A FAR increase of 0.2 is allowed for the following provisions:

     (a) Minimum size block. For each block comprised of at least four acres. A block need not
comprise one parcel, or one ownership, but all owners should agree on combined uses and site design,
with one cohesive development plan.

      (b) Workforce housing. For a minimum of 15% of total units provided for workforce housing, as
defined in § 156.007. The minimum 15% requirement is based upon the maximum base density for the
development, prior to the application of any incentive increases. For example, the maximum number of
residential units in a mixed use development located on five acres in the UC-CBS is 100 units (20 units
per acre x 5 acres = 100 units). Total workforce housing units required is 15 units (100 x 15% = 15
units).

      (c) Public space/open space/parks. For dedicated, contiguous public gathering space, open space,
or improved park area with a minimum area of 4,000 square feet for projects greater than one acre in
size; or for a minimum of 10% of total project area for projects of one acre or less in size. No portion of
the activity zone shall count toward the minimum area.

      (d) Curb cuts. For projects with no curb cuts on the boulevard or frontage road, but that instead
rely upon a parallel or perpendicular street for access. A perpendicular street is not a curb cut. For
projects with no frontage on the boulevard or frontage road, this incentive is available when there are no
curb cuts on the primary access road, as determined through the design review process. On/off ramps for
elevated interchanges shall not be considered as a frontage road or the primary access road.

    (3) Density increase for residential units. A corresponding 0.2 increase in density of residential
units is allowed in conjunction with increased FAR for the provision of the above incentives. Therefore,
the increased floor area may be utilized to accommodate an increase of up to 20% of residential density
for each incentive, or may be utilized for commercial or mixed use in the increased floor area. By way
of example, if mixed use is provided in the UC-CBS, the base density of 20 units per acre may be
increased to 28 units per acre if workforce housing and park area are provided (20 x 0.2 = 4 additional
units for workforce housing, plus 20 x 0.2 = 4 for park area equals 20 + 4 + 4 = 28).

    (4) No residential density limitation. No residential density limitation shall apply to projects that
are mixed use and meet all of the requirements of divisions (2)(a) through (d) above.

 (I) Activity zone uses and permits.

    (1) Defined. The area located between the street right-of-way and the build-to line is part of the
ACTIVITY ZONE a quasi-public space that may be used for placement of the required canopy trees,
pedestrian circulation, streetside dining, merchandise display, planters, A-frame signs, benches, trash
receptacles, and other street furnishings, as provided herein and in division (O)(1) of this section.
Description. The activity zone is a quasi-public space that may be used for pedestrian circulation,
placement of required canopy trees, planters, benches, trash receptacles, and other street furnishings,
in addition to the uses described herein.

    (2) Location. Because the activity zone is specifically defined as the area between the street right
of way line and build to line, this means that an activity zone is not permitted where a setback is
required.


                                                                                                    Page 6 of 39

                                                           Draft for Planning Commission Public Hearing 02.19.14

     (a) UC-CBS. In the UC-CBS, activity zones are expressly prohibited where a setback is
required, as specified in the UC-CBS Development Guidelines Chart.

     (b) UC-JDB. In the UC-JDB, activity zones are expressly prohibited on the following
neighborhood streets: Lansing Drive, Tall Pine Road, Dragoon Drive, Pine Hollow Road,
Cottingham Drive, Williamson Drive, and the western side of Bowman Road between Johnnie Dodds
Boulevard and Mathis Ferry Road.

     (c) UC-CDB. In the UC-CDB, activity zones are permitted only on the boulevard. Activity zones
are expressly prohibited on all side streets.

    (2 3) Allowed Permitted uses. All uses in the activity zone shall be conducted outside of the street
right-of-way. Design review approval shall be required prior to establishing any use and/or installing
any street furnishings within the activity zone. Allowed uses are limited to the following:

     (a) Streetside dining;

      (b) Outdoor merchandise display, which must be related to the business in front of which it is
located;

     (c) Non-amplified music performers or entertainers, subject to the town's noise ordinance;

     (d) Pushcarts; and

      (e) One A-frame or sandwich board sign per business, not exceeding 12 square feet in area and 40
inches in height. This sign is meant to be read by pedestrians, and shall not be placed on the public
sidewalk or otherwise inhibit pedestrian flow. These signs shall be of a high design quality, as illustrated
in Figure 2 below, and subject to the requirements of the Signs section of this chapter. A-frame signs
shall also require an approved sign permit.




                                                                                                    Page 7 of 39

   (3) Activity zone permit requirements.

     (a) A permit shall be required for all allowed activity zone uses, issued upon an application
devised by the Planning Department, and subject to a fee determined by Town Council.

     (b) The permit shall specify such uniform terms and conditions for each class of activity as may
be decided by Town Council for the conduct of activity zone uses.

      (c) The activity zone permit application shall require specifications on tables, chairs, planters, and
other applicable street furnishings in order to ensure compatibility with the particular site and the UC-
OD.

 (J) Curb cuts.

    (1) Except as provided herein, existing regulations concerning separation between curb cuts must
be met. The location, widths, curb radii, sidewalks, and street trees associated with curb cuts should be
carefully evaluated during the design review approval process, with the overall goal of making the
streets more walkable and pedestrian-friendly. Frequent curb cuts and large curb radii present hazards
for pedestrians.

    (2) One two-way access curb cut (driveway) for parcels with frontage of less than 200 feet along
the boulevards is allowed.

    (3) Two two-way access curb cuts (driveways) for parcels with 200 feet or more of frontage along
the boulevards are allowed.

   (4) No parcel shall be allowed to have more than two curb cuts along the boulevards.

    (5) Access points to the boulevards shall look like streets, not like parking lot entrances, as
illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 2 and 3.




                                                                                                    Page 8 of 39

                                   Figure 4 3. Looks like a parking lot.

   (6) Curb cuts shall be allowed along side or parallel streets as long as all other pertinent regulations,
such as distance between curb cuts, are met.

    (7) Shared vehicular access is encouraged; the benefit is more frontage and more developable land
on parcels.

 (K) Drive-through facilities.
                                                                                                    Page 9 of 39

                                                          Draft for Planning Commission Public Hearing 02.19.14


    (1) Because "drive-through culture" is not compatible with the overarching goals of the UC-OD,
drive-through facilities are generally discouraged, and may need to be located internal to sites, behind
other road front buildings that meet the goals of the UC-OD, except as provided in division (Q)(11 10)
of this section.

   (2) Drive-through lanes are prohibited within the activity zone.

    (3) Drive-through lanes shall not present impediments to the smooth and orderly flow of pedestrian
or vehicular traffic to or within the site.

 (L) Internal access roads.

    (1) In order to facilitate the replication of a grid street pattern and enhance the streetscape
appearance for nonresidential and mixed use developments where no public street is dedicated,
internal access roads shall be required whenever site design characteristics reasonably allow them on all
larger parcels and smaller parcels that have been aggregated. For residential developments where
public street dedication is required, the street standards contained elsewhere in this section apply.

   (2) These roads shall be designed to appear and function as a public street. Privately owned access
roads must be owner-maintained.

   (3) Sidewalks and on-street parking is are required. On-street parking spaces on internal access
roads may count towards required parking. Buildings should address these internal access roads in the
same manner as a public street with respect to orientation, setbacks, and bufferyard requirements.

  (M) Nonresidential parking and loading requirements/on-street parking. Great care should be taken
to create an adequate amount of off-street and on-street parking to serve development areas. The
location of parking should facilitate access to new developments, but not use valuable real estate better
suited to buildings and public space. Parking should be hidden between or behind buildings and in
parking structures, except as provided elsewhere in this section for single-family residential uses.

   (1) Shared parking.

     (a) Because one of the primary functions of the UC-OD is to provide a pedestrian-oriented
experience, and an overabundance of parking areas would detract from this goal, parking within a mixed
use development shall be shared for all uses.

      (b a) Required parking shall be calculated utilizing the shared parking standards established by
the Urban Land Institute for nonresidential uses; provided, however, no additional parking spaces shall
be required for uses conducted in the designated activity zone.

     (c b) If shared parking standards cannot be achieved, Off Street Parking and Loading
Requirements, §§ 156.170 et seq. of this chapter shall apply; provided, however, required parking for
commercial nonresidential uses may be reduced by 20%.

    (2) Residential uses. Parking spaces for residential uses shall be limited to a minimum of one 1.5
spaces and a maximum of two spaces per dwelling unit, and shall be included in shared parking
calculations.

                                                                                                  Page 10 of 39

    (3 2) On-street parking. (a) On-street parking shall be allowed on public residential streets within
and adjacent to the UC-OD; provided it is depicted on an on-street parking plan map, approved by the
town and SCDOT, submitted with the development site plan. Such on-street parking plan shall include
detailed design guidelines for the spaces, specifying items such as paving materials and the manner in
which the spaces shall be marked. but may not count toward the amount of parking spaces required
for a development. Where such on-street parking in the right-of-way is not feasible, parking in
easements on private property is highly encouraged.

       (b) On-street parking spaces located in the right-of-way and within 500 feet of walking distance
from any building entrance may count toward the required parking for the use or uses on the lot,
utilizing Urban Land Institute shared parking standards; provided, however, that care and discretion are
exercised in the design review approval process to not "recount" the same parking spaces for multiple
uses, and to ensure that parking demand is realistically assessed and met.

   (4) Pervious materials.

      (a) On private property, pervious materials, other than loose rock or gravel, may be utilized for
required parking spaces and parking drive aisles, subject to the design review approval process.

      (b) Pervious materials, other than loose rock or gravel, may be used in the right-of-way, subject to
SCDOT and town approval. Spaces in the right-of-way shall be a hard surface, with markings
delineating the spaces.

    (5) Design. The parking and loading design requirements shall be as follows, unless specified
otherwise in this section. (See especially § 156.329 (M)(5)(c)1. and 2. a. through d.)

      (a) Parking placement. Parking placement for multi-family, mixed use, and commercial uses
shall be as follows, unless specified otherwise in this section.

        1. Ground level parking in buildings and parking structures is permitted; provided the street
level frontage of the building is comprised of a minimum of 80% residential and/or usable commercial
space, and meets the requirements of divisions (b)2.a. through d. below.

        2. In no case shall ground level parking lots or exterior loading areas occupy more than one-
third of a lot's frontage along a pedestrian street or street segment; except as provided in division
(P)(5)(h) of this section with respect to building frontage and parking.

       3. Parking and exterior loading areas shall be buffered from any adjacent pedestrian
way by planting street trees and providing a landscaped area with a continuous row of high shrubs, or a
fence or seating wall.

     (b) Parking structures.

         1. When possible, parking structures (garages) shall be placed in the center of the block, as
illustrated in Figure 5 4, and may utilize ground floor parking.




                                                                                                  Page 11 of 39

        2. Parking in structures not located mid-block shall be above the ground floor or behind the
storefront or residential uses, if located on the ground floor as described below.

          a. If located to the side of a building, the parking structure must be set back from the front of
that building and have an architectural facade.

         b. Sloping floors shall not be visible from primary streets.

          c. Retail storefronts, residences, or other business uses on street level shall be required on
street frontages of parking structures to provide vitality.

         d. Vehicular access shall be from side streets or alleys wherever possible, and not directly
from the primary street.

      (c) Provisions for parking garages located in a flood zone. Notwithstanding any provisions to
the contrary, the following provisions may apply exclusively to parking garages located in a flood zone.

       1. Parking garages located in a flood zone may be exempt from the provisions of § 156.329
(M)(5)(a)1. and 2. (but not (a) 3.), and 156.329 (M)(5)(b)2. and 2.c. (but not 2.a., 2. b. and 2.d.).

       2. The following additional special provisions apply only to parking garages located in a flood
zone constructed under the exemptions of § 1 56.329(M)(5)(c)1. above.

         a. If the parking garage supports other uses, the required parking shall be calculated pursuant to
the provisions of § 156.171 or § 156.172 and the total amount of parking shall include an additional 100
spaces above the parking amount required for the other uses.

         b. The excess parking must be made available to the general public.

                                                                                                   Page 12 of 39

         c. Ground level parking must be completely screened from view with architectural elements
and landscaping.

          d. The parking garage must provide added features such as public art, a fountain, a bus stop or
similar feature(s) to promote and maintain pedestrian activity in the activity zone, with the arrangement
of these features configured so as to eliminate any "dead" space, with the activity (commercial,
residential) fronting the parking garage to the extent possible on the Boulevard side and side street sides.

    (d) Incentive for parking structures. There shall be no maximum parking requirements for
commercial uses if a parking structure is utilized on site.

      (e) Parking for outdoor dining. Parking for outdoor dining shall be as provided in § 156.171 for
restaurant use and not based upon square footage of outdoor use area.

      (f) Parking for activity zone uses. Additional parking shall not be required for uses conducted in
the activity zone.

 (N) Other considerations.

   (1) Elevated buildings.

     (a) Buildings in flood zones.

        1. In order to project a pedestrian-friendly streetscape, it is highly recommended that
alternatives to elevating commercial buildings located in "A" flood zones be pursued. This may be
accomplished by floodproofing or altering the elevation of the finished floor inside the building.
However, in the event that these techniques are not feasible and the building must be elevated, such
elevation may not exceed the minimum elevation required plus one foot of additional "freeboard";
provided further , that this provision shall not apply to a parking garage located in a flood zone meeting
the requirements of §156.329 (M)(5)(c)2. a. through d.

        2. To the maximum extent possible, elevating the building shall not compromise the width and
integrity of the activity zone.

      (b) Residential structures. Residential structures that are not within a flood zone shall not be
elevated where they front a public street.

     (c) Buildings elevated for parking. See divisions (M)(5)(a)1. through 3, (M)(5)(b)1. and 2.a.
through d. for buildings elevated for parking not located in a flood zone and (M)(5)(c)1. and 2. a.
through d. for buildings elevated for parking located in a flood zone.

    (2) False second floors. False second floors are not allowed for buildings in which multiple stories
are required. However, a mezzanine comprising one-third of the area of the floor below, or an atrium
located between the floor and ceiling equivalent to two-story spaces, may be utilized to fulfill this
requirement.

    (3) Access easements. Where interconnectivity is proposed, access easements shall be provided
from a public right-of-way to the property line of the adjacent property it is meant to serve. Where a
final plat is required, easements shall be provided prior to final plat approval; for developments that

                                                                                                   Page 13 of 39

                                                          Draft for Planning Commission Public Hearing 02.19.14

do not require a final plat, easements shall be provided prior to issuance of any building permits for
the development. Easements shall provide for unencumbered access by the adjoining property
owner(s) and the public through the property in perpetuity, or until such time as the property is
redeveloped and the easement is no longer required.

    (4) National Electrical Safety Code/local utility code requirements. In all cases, build-to, and side
and rear yard setbacks are subject to and superseded by applicable National Electrical Safety Code and
local utility code requirements; provided, however, that approval through the design review process will
allow flexibility in administering these requirements. For example, the addition of another power pole
may be required to reduce the amount of wind-generated sway in power line conductors, to allow a
building to be placed in closer proximity to the conductor. These situations will be addressed on a case-
by-case basis during the design review approval process.

     (5) Setbacks for Single-family residential uses. Individual dwelling units in attached buildings, the
buildings themselves, and detached single-family dwelling units may be located on their own fee-simple
lot, with access provided by a shared ingress/egress easement. The intent is to allow a fee-simple lot
subdivision exclusive to the actual building pad, or close proximity thereto in a "postage stamp" fashion
within the larger parcel boundary. This necessitates elimination of the normal yard setback requirements
and bufferyard requirements on these "postage stamp" lots.

     (a) The shared ingress/egress easement and all required parking for the use shall be located on
property owned by a property owners' association, with covenant restrictions insuring access and
maintenance of the same, and a method of collecting sufficient funds through assessments to owners to
cover the maintenance costs. Lot and Street Standards.


       1. Minimum lot size. Individual dwelling units, including detached single-family dwellings,
duplex dwellings, and townhouse dwellings, may be located on their own fee-simple lot with no
minimum lot size or lot coverage requirements. Lot size and buildable lot area shall be determined by
setback, yard area, and parking requirements.

       2. Dedicated public street. Individual dwelling units , including detached single-family
dwellings, duplex dwellings, and townhouse dwellings, may be subdivided only when abutting, and
with direct access from, a dedicated public street.

         a. In cases where single-family lots are subdivided with access to an existing public street,
access for parking must be located to the rear of the lots (alley-fed). Driveways for individual dwelling
units may not be located on existing public streets.

          b. Any new streets created in the UC-OD require a minimum right-of-way width of 33 feet,
with two 10-foot (minimum) travel lanes. The street shall contain, on each side, a five foot sidewalk,
street tree plantings, and a curb. The required street trees may be located on private property outside
the public right-of-way.

           c. Where attached single-family dwellings may be approved along any of the boulevard
streets, requirements for sidewalks and street tree plantings shall be in accordance with the
specifications of the respective sub-district.



                                                                                                  Page 14 of 39

                                                          Draft for Planning Commission Public Hearing 02.19.14

          d. The street design standards in § 155.048 may be utilized to meet the requirements of this
section; provided, however that the lot standards of § 155.047 (C)(1) pertaining to "postage stamp"
lots may not be utilized and the previous requirements are met.

        3. Setbacks and yard requirements for principal and accessory structures. The minimum
setback along all property lines is five feet, except where setbacks or build-to lines have been
established for specific side streets in the UC-OD, in which case such requirements shall take
precedence where any single-family, duplex, or townhouse dwellings have frontage on those streets.

     (b) A copy of these restrictive covenants shall be approved by the town prior to subdivision of the
property into fee-simple lots. Parking.

       1. Number of spaces. A minimum of two parking spaces per dwelling unit are required.

        2. Size of spaces. Each parking space should generally be a minimum of 9 feet in width and 18
feet in depth.

        3. Location. All required parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the dwelling unit
they are intended to serve. Because a primary purpose of the UC-OD is to create a pedestrian-friendly
environment, parking spaces should generally be located to the side or rear of a dwelling unit so as to
limit the encroachment of driveways into the public realm. To this end, required parking spaces may
be tandem.

     (c) Qualification for subdivision pursuant to these provisions is contingent upon buildings located
on the proposed lots meeting all applicable building and fire code provisions, and having an approved
drainage plan. Approval Process.

       1. Subdivision approval.

        a. All single-family residential use developments in the UC-OD shall require sketch plan and
preliminary plat approval by the Planning Commission.

          b. The Planning Commission shall be responsible for approval of tree removal for the
installation of infrastructure and the configuration of lots, to include consideration of tree locations
and buildable area of lots, and the appropriateness of open space where it has been provided.

       2. Design Review.

         a. Prior to application for a building permit, the applicant shall submit to design review staff
for approval.

         b. In all cases, design review staff will ensure compliance with any conditions of approval
placed on the development by the Planning Commission, site requirements specific to the UC-OD,
and other relevant ordinance sections.

         c. Architectural design review approval shall only be required for duplex and townhouse
dwellings and is required prior to issuance of building permits. Detached single-family dwellings are
not subject to architectural design review.


                                                                                                  Page 15 of 39

        3. Checklist. The required sketch plan and preliminary plat shall include, at a minimum, the
information listed in the UC-OD Sketch Plan Checklist and UC-OD Preliminary Plat Checklist, as
applicable, provided by the Department of Planning and Development, as may be amended from time
to time.

    (6 5) Civic uses. Because of the nature of their uses, build-to lines, setbacks, and other design
elements for civic uses, such as school buildings, churches, fire stations, and the like, shall be
determined in the design review approval process.

   (7 6) Rezonings. Property owners may submit an application for rezoning to PD, Planned
Development District, or any other use district classification, including removal from the UC-OD and its
requirements, subject to the rezoning process.

 (O) Design guidelines.

   (1) Activity zone design standards.

     (a) Awnings.

        1. Awnings may cover the entire activity zone area not utilized for canopy tree placement and
as defined for streetside dining.

       2. Awnings must comprise a minimum of five feet in depth, measured horizontally from face of
building.

       3. Awnings shall be a maximum of eight feet in height, measured from the bottom of an awning
and/or valence to the sidewalk adjacent to building. This measurement may be adjusted for grand, multi-
story windows.

      (b) Balconies. Balconies may project over the activity zone, but in no instance shall they extend
over the right-of-way.

      (c) Raised planters. In order to enhance the pedestrian-oriented theme of development, planters
shall be required as a design element to soften the building exterior and enhance the streetscape.

     (d) Street furniture. Street furniture shall be utilized to enhance and facilitate the pedestrian
experience and shall not be utilized as additional signage.

      (e) Pedestrian access to remain unimpeded. In all cases, permanent or temporary design features
or activities shall not impede pedestrian access on the public sidewalk.

    (2) Residential access to the street. Units on the second floor and above must have a direct access
to the street. This access may be created through the use of a single or multiple lobby(ies) that access the
street level.

   (3) Building fronts.

      (a) Primary entry. For buildings with public street frontage on the boulevards or frontage roads,
the primary entry must be from Coleman Boulevard, Ben Sawyer Boulevard, Johnnie Dodds Boulevard

                                                                                                   Page 16 of 39

frontage road, or Chuck Dawley Boulevard. Rear of buildings shall not be designed to appear as fronts.
Display windows are required on all street facades for retail buildings. Other commercial or office
buildings shall adhere to the requirements of § 156.327 (E)(6)(c)4. Second floor and above, with a
separate entrance from the first floor, shall have primary entrance from the primary street, when feasible.
Buildings, businesses, and residences facing side streets should have entrances from the side street.

     (b) Secondary entry. Secondary entrances from the rear of a store may be allowed; however, this
area may not be treated as a storefront in detailing or pedestrian amenities.

   (5) Terminal vistas.

     (a) Properties that terminate views down streets shall be identified during the design review
process, and will be held to a higher architectural standard along this visible facade.

     (b) Such identified properties are those that are across from side streets that intersect the primary
boulevard and terminate or intersect and continue at a different angle.

      (c) Properties that are at the end of a straightaway on the boulevard shall also meet this
requirement.

 (P) UC-CBS, Coleman-Ben Sawyer Boulevard Urban Corridor District.

    (1) Boundaries of the district. The boundaries of the district are generally described as including
those properties abutting Coleman Boulevard and Ben Sawyer Boulevard, located between the
intersections of Magrath Darby Boulevard on the north and Patriot's Point Boulevard on the south, and
the beginning of the Ben Sawyer Causeway, specifically excluding those properties located within the
Shem Creek Waterfront Overlay District and the residential subdivision of Bayview Acres, and as more
accurately depicted on the official zoning map, including any amendments thereto, now or in the future.
The boundary of the district is graphically depicted in the following Figure 6 5.




                                                                                                  Page 17 of 39

   (2) Intent and findings.

     (a) Intent. The intent of the overlay district is to provide a scheme for the redevelopment and
adaptive use for the project area as a pedestrian-oriented, bicycle-friendly, mixed use, distinctive urban
environment to act as a focal gathering point for the town. A combination of the highest quality
standards of site and building design, coupled with a true mixture of uses, will provide an environment
ensuring a lively, vibrant human experience in the activity zone along the street.

      (b) Findings. In furtherance of the stated purpose, Town Council finds and declares the
following:

        1. The identified Coleman-Ben Sawyer Boulevard Urban Corridor Overlay District is a
developed area and located in the older and traditional part of town, much of which is underutilized and
suitable for redevelopment.

        2. Creating an overlay district on portions of Coleman Boulevard and Ben Sawyer Boulevard
will encourage appropriate redevelopment to reestablish the vitality and vibrancy of this part of town.
Certain incentives in this district will encourage a true mixture of uses and improve the standards of site
and building design.

                                                                                                   Page 18 of 39

        3. A renewed and vibrant Coleman-Ben Sawyer Boulevard Urban Corridor Overlay District
will contribute to the overall economic, aesthetic, and general well-being of the town.

      4. The redevelopment of this area is compatible with the goals and objectives of the Town
Comprehensive Plan, and the Coleman and Ben Sawyer Boulevards Revitalization Master Plan, and the
Coleman Revitalization Advisory Board Report to Mount Pleasant Mayor and Town Council.

     (3) Specific mixed use requirements for certain areas.

      (a) A minimum of 60% of the ground floor street frontage shall be utilized for retail, restaurant,
or entertainment use, as permitted in division (D) of this section, in buildings with frontage on Coleman
Boulevard, within the area located between Live Oak Street and the intersection of Coleman, Ben
Sawyer, and Chuck Dawley Boulevards. Such retail, restaurant, or entertainment space shall be of a
meaningful depth so as to create a functional, usable commercial space that addresses the activity zone
and creates interest and activity in the public realm.

       (b) The remaining 40% of first floor level floor area may be devoted to office or residential use.

    (c) This requirement shall only apply to parcels that have greater than 100 feet frontage on
Coleman Boulevard, measured property line to property line.

    (4) Density of residential use. Maximum density of residential uses shall be 16 units per acre for
single use residential development, and 20 units per acre for mixed use development; except that
additional density may be allowed as provided in division (H)(1) of this section. For the purposes of
calculating residential density, mixed use projects or developments are those consisting of both
residential and nonresidential uses such as commercial, retail, office, or professional services.

     (5) Site development and design elements.

      (a) Maximum height, setbacks and build-to lines, and bufferyard requirements. Maximum height,
setbacks and build-to lines, and bufferyard requirements shall be as depicted in the following
development guidelines chart and corresponding Figure 7 6. UC-CBS Development Guidelines Map,
and as further described herein, except civic uses, which shall be in accordance with division (N)(6)
herein.

                            Figure 7 6. UC-CBS Development Guidelines Map.

     (b) Building height.

        1. Building heights shall be measured from the top of curb, or edge of paving if curb is not
present, based on an average measurement taken at all building comers corners, and every 25 feet along
the length of any street or internal access road to either the building eave or ridge of roof, as applicable.

         2. Where indicated on the development guidelines chart and corresponding map, the maximum
height limit shall be 55 feet, measured from the top of curb to the building eave; provided further that
all structures shall have a minimum of two floors, with a maximum of four floors allowed. The two-
floor minimum shall only apply to buildings fronting the boulevard.
[This was inadvertently removed with the December 2013 text amendments pertaining to parking
structures in flood zones.]

       3. Where indicated on the development guidelines chart and corresponding map, the maximum
building height limit shall be 45 feet.

          a. The maximum height shall be measured to the ridge of the roof, not the eave; provided
further that, in cases where buildings utilize a flat roof, the maximum height shall be measured to the top
of the roof structure. Parapet walls are allowed above the 45-foot-height limit, but may not exceed an
additional four feet in height.

         b. All structures shall have a minimum of two floors, with a maximum of three floors
allowed. The two floor minimum shall only apply to buildings fronting the boulevard.




                                                                                                    Page 21 of 39
                                                                                DRAFT UC-OD Text Amendments

        4. A maximum height of 75 feet, with a minimum of two floors and with a maximum of six
floors, measured to the eave, will be allowed in three specific locations in the UC-CBS, as indicated on
the development guidelines chart and map.

          a. The limits of the 75 foot height zone shall be measured 150 feet from any abutting
residential property line or from an abutting street right-of-way adjoining residential property, provided
such residential property is located outside of the UC-CBS.

          b. In the area located inside the 150-foot line, the building height shall be 55 feet, measured to
the eave, except as provided in footnote 1 in the development guidelines chart above.

         c. The two-floor minimum shall only apply to buildings fronting the boulevard.

        5. Additional property may be allowed a maximum height of 75 feet; provided these properties
are incorporated/aggregated with those in one of the three locations in which the 75 foot height limit is
allowed in a unified development scheme that meets all of the requirements of the overlay district,
subject to the requirements of divisions (P)(5)(b)4.a. and b., above.

         a. Moultrie Plaza area (D1) includes additional properties located in D2 and D3, within the
area bounded by Coleman Boulevard/Simmons Street/Rue de Muckle/and where Shem Drive intersects
Vincent Drive across from Fairmont Avenue (which does not include Brookgreen shopping center).

         b. Family Dollar The Boulevard site area (D1) includes additional properties located in D2,
within the area bounded by Coleman Boulevard/Fairmont Avenue/King Street/Pherigo Street.

        c. Sea Island shopping center area (E3) includes additional properties located in E1, bounded
by Ben Sawyer Boulevard/Chuck Dawley Boulevard/Schirmer Street and its extension to Ben Sawyer
Boulevard.

       6. Utilization of area above the maximum height.

          a. No area above the maximum height or maximum number of stories may be used to create
an extra floor of living area or enclosed commercial space. However, this area may be used for storage
and such uses as open decks or rooftop restaurants.

         b. Multilevel decks above the maximum height are expressly prohibited.

     (c) Build-to lines/setbacks. The build-to line or setback shall be as indicated on the development
guidelines chart, except for civic uses, which shall be determined through the design review process in
accordance with the provisions of division (N)(6) herein.

      (d) Building size limitations. No limitations on square footage of structures will be imposed.
However, because "big box" retail development is not consistent with the purpose of the UC-CBS, the
building footprint of any individual structure is limited to 50,000 square feet.

     (e) Bufferyards and plantings.

       1. Front yard buffer.


                                                                                                   Page 22 of 39

         a. For buildings fronting Coleman Boulevard, Ben Sawyer Boulevard, or side streets, no
understory or shrub plantings are required.

          b. However, three canopy trees of a minimum-four-inch caliper shall be required for each 100
linear feet of road frontage, using species such as Southern Red Oak, Live Oak, Willow Oak, Elm
varieties and American Beech. Such tree types to be consistent with each block and evenly spaced, with
exceptions made for curb cuts, utilities, and other obstructions. On side streets, the required street trees
shall be located in an area behind the sidewalk.

         c. In order to enhance the pedestrian-oriented theme of development, planters shall be
required as a design element to soften the building exterior and enhance the streetscape appearance.

           i. Internal side and rear (non-street frontage) bufferyards shall be provided in accordance
with the requirements of the development guidelines chart and map.

            ii. Sabal Palmettos shall be planted in the public right-of-way adjacent to lots on Coleman
and Ben Sawyer Boulevards, at approximately 30 feet on center. Additional low shrub or groundcover
plantings, including grass, may be required between the Sabal Palmettos in the verge.

           iii. Parking lot islands, which must include canopy trees of four-inch caliper or larger, of a
species approved during the design review approval process, must be provided at a minimum of every
12 spaces when adjacent to rear or side property lines, and internal parking lot islands either shall be
provided at a minimum of every 12 spaces or only at the end of parking rows.

     (g f) Sidewalks and activity zone landscaping.

       1. There shall be a public sidewalk, either within the right-of-way or within a pedestrian
easement on private property, on both sides of all streets within the UC-CBS, a minimum of five feet
wide on side streets and internal access roads, and a minimum of eight feet wide on boulevard streets.

        2. On boulevard streets, these walks shall typically be separated from traffic by a grassed verge,
which shall be a minimum of three feet wide, measured from the back of curb, and planted with
Palmettos at approximately 30 feet on center; provided, however, that where on-street parking is
utilized, the Palmettos may be planted in openings of three feet by three feet, with eight-feet-wide
sidewalks serving the parallel parking areas. See Figures 12, 13, and 14 7 and 8.

      (f g) Relationship of buildings to the street. Because of the stated purpose of the UC-OD,
maintaining a strong, single-plane, pedestrian-oriented relationship between the building front and the
street is important. Therefore, changes in elevation between buildings and streets shall be avoided to the
fullest extent possible. Activity zone grading shall be a crucial initial design consideration, as it will
determine the finished floor elevation(s) of the building and may be a limiting factor in door placements
and tenant space allocations. The accessible route(s) to the tenant space(s) may influence the useable
space within the activity zone. As a general rule, the following standards shall apply; provided, however,
exceptions may be allowed as noted herein.
                                                                                                 Page 24 of 39
                                                                               DRAFT UC-OD Text Amendments
                                                          Draft for Planning Commission Public Hearing 02.19.14


        1. Grade changes. Slopes shall not exceed 5% within the area located between the top of curb
or the edge of pavement and the face of the building. Handicapped accessibility must comply with the
requirements of the latest adopted edition of the International Building Code, which may result in
reductions to the maximum slope.

       2. Strategies for accommodating grade changes. The following design techniques are examples
that may be utilized to accommodate grade changes and achieve the pedestrian-oriented relationship of
building front and the street:

           a. Step-finished floor of building. Where grade changes make it a necessity, the finished floor
of buildings shall STEP step (i.e., maintain a consistent grade) with the existing grades along the street,
as illustrated in Figure 8 9 below. Buildings with long facades or located on lots with varying grades or a
long street frontage may require multiple steps in the finished floor to remain consistent with the
existing street grade.




                               Figure 8 9. Step-finished floor of building.

          b. Recessed doors. Building entry doors may be recessed, as illustrated in Figure 9 10, to
accommodate required landings at entries, and to provide increased finished floor elevation and a greater
length of slope within this area. Steps within the recess may also increase finished floor elevation.




                                                                                                  Page 25 of 39
                                                                             DRAFT UC-OD Text Amendments

                                     Figure 9 10. Recessed doors.

          c. Ramps and stairs. Ramps and stairs may be provided either within or along the side or rear
of the building and not within the activity zone.

          d. The provision of additional access doors may be necessary to accommodate handicapped
access.

          e. A combination or all of the design elements referenced above may be required to achieve
the desired activity zone relationship described, as illustrated in Figure 10 11.




                   Figure 10 11. Variety of design elements to address grade changes.

        3. Exceptions. Certain circumstances may render maintenance of the 5% maximum slope within
the area located between the top of curb or edge of pavement and the face of the building impractical.
Examples of such circumstances include, but are not limited to, existing grade elevation conditions that
cannot reasonably be altered, the accommodation of drainage concerns and/or special requirements of
flood hazard areas. In such cases, the following exceptions may apply. However, it must be emphasized

                                                                                                Page 26 of 39

that the exceptions will apply only after the above-referenced design techniques have been incorporated
to the greatest extent possible, and the 5% maximum slope standard cannot be met because of unusual
circumstances.

           a. A maximum of two stair risers, of between four and seven inches in height, abutting the
sidewalk, may be utilized to accommodate a change in elevation, as illustrated in Figure 11; provided
that the slope from the top stair tread to the face of the building does not exceed 5%.

         b. The sidewalk abutting the stairs must have a minimum width of eight feet, with dedicated
public access for any portion located outside of the public right-of-way.




                                Figure 11 12. Stairs in the Activity Zone.

         c. Greater consideration shall be given for these exceptions for sites involving additions and
renovations to existing buildings than for redevelopment or development of vacant lots.

     (g) Sidewalks and activity zone. [moved to (f)]

       1. There shall be a public sidewalk, either within the right-of-way or within a pedestrian
easement on private property, on both sides of all streets within the UC-CBS, a minimum of five feet
wide on side streets and internal access roads, and a minimum of eight feet wide on boulevard streets.

        2. On boulevard streets, these walks shall typically be separated from traffic by a grassed verge,
which shall be a minimum of three feet wide, measured from the back of curb, and planted with
Palmettos at approximately 30 feet on center; provided, however, that where on-street parking is
utilized, the Palmettos may be planted in openings of three feet by three feet, with eight-feet-wide
sidewalks serving the parallel parking areas. See Figures 12, 13 and 14.

     (h) Lot frontage/pocket parks and other urban open space/plazas. The goal of these requirements
is to maintain a cohesive streetscape framed by buildings that address the public realm. Frontage will be
assessed as the building facade that is located within the build-to area or within four feet of the setback
line. Frontage shall be considered for both of the required two stories, while higher stories may be set
back from the bottom two stories. The purpose of the pocket park or other urban open space/plazas is to
provide variety in the public realm and usable outdoor space outside of the activity zone.

       1. On Coleman Boulevard, between the intersection of Lansing Drive and the intersection of
Chuck Dawley Boulevard, the minimum building frontage on properties of less than 100 feet shall be
100% of its frontage, except for adequate allowance for one curb cut. The total required building
frontage may be accomplished through a phased development plan.

       2. For properties with more than 100 feet of frontage on the boulevards, a minimum of 70%
building frontage shall be required. The total required building frontage may be accomplished through a
phased development plan.

        3. Pocket parks, plazas, and other urban open spaces that are integrated into the overall design
of a project shall count for a maximum of 20% of the required building frontage.

         4. The minimum allowable size of a pocket park or other suitable urban open space shall be 12
feet of frontage and 300 square feet of overall area.

     (i) On-street parallel parking may be implemented on both sides of Coleman Boulevard, from
Simmons Street to Erckman Drive. On-street parking in other areas may be either parallel or angled,
designed according to accepted standards, and approved by the town and SCDOT.

 (Q) UC-JDB, Johnnie Dodds Boulevard Urban Corridor Overlay District.

    (2) Intent. The intent of the UC-JDB District is to enhance the driving experience for the motorist
as well as the pedestrian experience in terms of convenience, safety, and aesthetics; to create
opportunities for the redevelopment of underutilized properties along the corridor to attract jobs and
create economic development opportunities and tourism for the community; to enhance East Cooper
Regional Medical Center and provide an incentive for other medical practices to collocate; to create
opportunities for civic uses that will enhance the hospitality industry within a Hospitality/Economic
Development District; to enhance connections to the Memorial Waterfront Park and Waterfront
Gateway District; to protect existing residential neighborhoods both adjacent to and near the corridor; to
facilitate new and more pedestrian-oriented retail establishments that provide the everyday needs of the
area residents; to define new open spaces, parks, and gathering spaces along the corridor as transition
areas between development parcels throughout the districts along the corridor; to create new
development guidelines for enhancing the corridor through creative land planning and architectural
patterns in all the newly created districts; and to enhance housing opportunities conducive with the area.

     (5) Number of stories.

       (a) Buildings fronting on the frontage road shall be a minimum of two stories.

        (b) Buildings fronting on side streets (non-frontage roads) and buildings located at the
intersections between the frontage road and Johnnie Dodds Boulevard may utilize a single story.

      (6) Building height. Building heights shall be measured from the top of curb, or edge of paving if
curb is not present, based on an average measurement taken at all building corners, and every 25 feet
along the length of any street or internal access road to the building eave.

       (a) Neighborhood Commercial and Office District. Maximum building height is 55 feet, except
as provided in division (c) below.

      (b) Hospitality/Economic Development District and Health and Wellness/Economic
Development District. Maximum building height is 80 feet, except as provided in division (c) below.

        (c) In all cases, the maximum height for buildings in the UC-JDB that are located within 50 feet
of an abutting residential property line, or an abutting street right-of-way adjoining residential property
outside of the UC-JDB, shall be 40 feet, measured from grade to roof ridge, and further provided that no
such building shall exceed a maximum of three stories.

     (7) Frontage road parking.

       (a) Because on-street parking is a critical component for achieving the type of development
promoted in the urban corridor, the provision of on-street parking in the right-of-way, where possible, is
required.

        (b) Where such on-street parking in the right-of-way is not possible, parking in easements on
private property along the frontage road for redevelopment projects and development of vacant parcels
is highly encouraged.

      (c) The intended frontage road cross section is illustrated in Figure 19, though the cross section
may vary subject to road improvements.

   (8 7) Build-to lines/rear yard setback requirements.

     (a) Front yard build-to line.

        1. Requirement for buildings fronting on the frontage road is 20 to 30 feet, with a minimum 15-
foot 8-foot sidewalk.

        2. Requirement for buildings fronting on side streets (non-frontage road) and located at the
intersections between the frontage road and Johnnie Dodds Boulevard for intersection properties, as
described in division (Q)(11), is 20 to 30 feet, with a minimum-five-foot sidewalk. For properties
where the Mathis Ferry Road buffer applies, the build-to line shall be determined through the design
review process.

        3. Build-to lines shall be measured from the back of curb to the face of the building. If no
curb is present, build-to lines shall be measured from the edge of pavement.

     (b) Rear yard setback. Rear yard setback is 15 feet.

     (c) Exceptions.

        1. Contingent upon approval through the design review process, development utilizing an
integrated site plan involving multiple parcels may forego rear yard setbacks along parcel lines, except
when commercial uses abut residential uses lying outside the district boundaries. In the latter case, a
minimum 15-foot setback is required.

        2. Build-to lines and setbacks for civic uses shall be in accordance with the provisions of
division (N)(6) herein.

   (9 8) Bufferyards.

     (a) Mathis Ferry Road buffer. See § 156.201(J)(3) 156.201 (I) (3).

      (b) Front yard. Street trees are required. Three canopy trees of a minimum-four-inch caliper
shall be required for each 100 linear feet of road frontage, using species such as Southern Red Oak, Live
Oak, Willow Oak, Elm varieties, and American Beech. Such tree types to be consistent with each block
and evenly spaced, with exceptions made for curb cuts, utilities, and other obstructions.


                                                                                                  Page 34 of 39

       (c) Side and rear yards. In general, bufferyard requirements on individual parcels are specified in
§ 156.201; however, contingent upon approval through the design review process, development utilizing
an integrated site plan involving multiple parcels may forego side and rear bufferyards along parcel
lines, except when commercial uses abut residential uses lying outside the district boundaries. In the
latter case, a minimum 10-foot, Type "C" bufferyard, with an F3 "shadow-box" style fence, is required
in all instances. This buffer may overlap with the required side and/or rear yard setback. In addition,
buffers are not required where common wall construction to adjacent properties spanning property
lines is utilized in accordance with applicable building and fire code requirements.
    (10 9) Exceptions for the Health and Wellness/Economic Development District. Because the
typical frontage road cross section will not be implemented in the vicinity of Bowman Road, due to its
use as on-ramp and off-ramp access to the elevated interchange, the development standards applicable to
the orientation of the frontage road will instead be applied to Bowman Road, or as otherwise determined
through the design review process.

    (11 10) Intersection properties. This overlay district zoning scheme recognizes that the relatively
small sites near the intersections and located between the frontage road and Johnnie Dodds Boulevard
will continue to be utilized for such uses as fast food restaurants and convenience stores. These are
necessary uses for an urban boulevard setting, their sites are not large enough for other Neighborhood
Commercial uses as contemplated in these regulations, and the opportunity to aggregate parcels is
negated by the roadway configuration. Therefore, these properties should be developed or redeveloped
in such a fashion so as to meet, to the fullest extent possible, the provisions promulgated herein as
determined through the design review process, in full recognition that certain incentives or requirements
cannot be achieved.

    (12 11) Pedestrian trails/access/open space/parks. A key component of the UC-JDB is the
provision of an integrated pedestrian and bicycle access plan through sidewalks and trails. This system is
graphically depicted in an illustrative manner in Figure 20, below. Dedication of easements and
construction for sidewalks and pedestrian trails on development parcels may be required in the approval
process to implement this pedestrian and bicycle access system. In addition to the pedestrian trail
system, areas suitable for open space and parks are illustrated in the following Figure 20 17.




                                                                                                 Page 35 of 39

    (2) Intent. The intent of the district is to implement the recommendations of the Town
Comprehensive Plan 2009-2019 by completing the "third leg" of the urban and transit corridor
comprised of Coleman/Ben Sawyer Boulevards, Johnnie Dodds Boulevard and Chuck Dawley
Boulevard. This triangular-shaped area represents the urban core of the southern end of town. Because
the triangle is bisected by Shem Creek, with no cross-access along its length, this "loop" will serve as a
primary transit corridor for the suburban core. The development of the UC-CDB will be smaller scale,
interspersed mixed use development with respect to height, density and compactness than the other two
corridors, but will retain the same integral components of mixed use commercial and residential
development in a pedestrian-friendly, walkable style of development.

    (3) Density for residential uses. Maximum density of residential uses shall be 16 units per acre for
single use residential development, and 20 units per acre for mixed use development. For the purposes
of calculating residential density, mixed use projects or developments are those consisting of both
residential and nonresidential uses such as commercial, retail, office, or professional services.

    (4) Building height. Maximum building height shall be 40 feet, provided that no such building
shall exceed a maximum of three stories. Building heights shall be measured from the top of curb, or
edge of paving if curb is not present, based on an average measurement taken at all building corners, and
every 25 feet along the length of any street or internal access road to the building eave.

                                                                                                  Page 37 of 39

   (5) Build-to lines/rear yard setback requirements.

     (a) Front yard build-to line.

        1. Front yard build-to line is 20 feet, which includes a 15-foot an 8-foot sidewalk only when an
activity zone is included as part of the development plan; otherwise, the existing sidewalk shall be
sufficient to meet the intent of this section, unless no sidewalk exists in which case installation of a 5-
foot sidewalk shall be required.

        2. Build-to lines shall be measured from the back of curb to the face of the building. If no
curb is present, build-to lines shall be measured from the edge of pavement.

     (b) Rear yard setback. Rear yard setback is 15 feet.

     (c) Exceptions.

        1. Contingent upon approval through the design review process, development utilizing an
integrated site plan involving multiple parcels may forego rear yard setbacks along parcel lines, except
when commercial uses abut residential uses lying outside the district boundaries. In the latter case, a
minimum-15-foot setback is required.

        2. Build-to lines and setbacks for civic uses shall be in accordance with the provisions of
division (N)(6) herein.

   (6) Bufferyards.

     (a) Front yard.

       1. For buildings fronting on Chuck Dawley Boulevard or side streets, no understory or shrub
plantings are required.

        2. However, three canopy trees of a minimum-four-inch caliper shall be required for each 100
linear feet of road frontage, using species such as Southern Red Oak, Live Oak, Willow Oak, Elm
varieties, and American Beech. Such tree types to be consistent with each block and evenly spaced, with
exceptions made for curb cuts, utilities, and other obstructions.

       (b) Side and rear yards. In general, bufferyard requirements on individual parcels are specified in
§ 156.201. However, contingent upon approval through the design review process, development
utilizing an integrated site plan involving multiple parcels may forego side and rear bufferyards along
parcel lines, except when commercial uses abut residential uses lying outside the district boundaries. In
the latter case, a minimum-ten-foot, Type "C" bufferyard, with an F3 "shadow-box" style fence, is
required in all instances. This buffer may overlap with the required side and/or rear yard setback. In
addition, buffers are not required where common wall construction to adjacent properties spanning
property lines is utilized in accordance with applicable building and fire code requirements.

ADDITIONAL TEXT AMENDMENTS

Add the following definitions to § 156.007:

    ACTIVITY ZONE. The improved area located between the street right-of-way and the build-to line,
which has been approved through the design review process and which may be utilized for pedestrian-
friendly uses, such as but not limited to, streetside dining, entertainment, pushcarts, or outdoor display of
merchandise.

    FLOOR AREA RATIO (FAR). Expresses the relationship between the amount of useable floor area
permitted in a building or buildings and the area of the lot on which the building stands. It is obtained by
dividing the gross floor area of a building by the total area of the lot. The diagram below illustrates three
ways that a FAR of 1.0 might be achieved: a one-story building covering the entire lot, a two-story
building covering half the lot, or a four-story building covering one quarter of the lot.




  OUTDOOR DINING. These areas shall be located outside of the activity zone and may be open to
the elements and temporarily enclosed by means such as fencing, walls, plastic, or other enclosing
materials and methods due to weather.

  PUSHCART. A non-self-propelled vehicle designed to be readily moveable, from which merchandise
or food is sold.

  STREETSIDE DINING. These areas shall be located within the activity zone, and are specifically
required to be open air, unconditioned dining, open to the elements and not enclosed by any means, such
as fencing, walls, plastic, or other enclosing materials and methods; except that awnings shall be
allowed. Temporary planters for landscaping may be used to delineate the dining area, but may not
impede pedestrian access.

     Development Impact Assessment 
     Gateway Site ­ Magrath Darby Blvd. 


I.   GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED PROJECT
     The proposed development will consist of       a n O ffice Building and a Hotel l ocated on
     approximately 5.03 acres fronting Magrath Darby Boulevard (TMS Nos. 517-00-00-092 & 517-
     00-00-093, see Appendix 1) located in the Town of Mount Pleasant. T he existing undeveloped
     site is in a desirable location situ ated between US Hwy. 17/Johnnie Dodds Boulevard and
     Coleman Boulevard with close proximity to t he Cooper River Bridge an d downtown Charleston.
     The proposed uses will be an asse t to the area and the Town of Mou nt Pleasant by attracting
     tourism spending and providing high end office space for potential new businesses. The site is
     currently zoned PD for AB uses.       The Town' s Compreh ensive Plan Future Land Use Map
     recommends Waterfront Gateway zoning district land uses for the property.
     Proposed new uses include:
         A 62,500 SF, 4-story, Class A Office Building (3-story over 1 level of parking)
         A 110 guest room (75,000 GSF), 6-story Hotel (5-story over 1 level of parking)
         A shared parking lot
     Phasing:
     The initial p hase of con struction for this project is expected to begin May 2014 with the start of
     the hotel pr oject. The office building should start shortly thereafter as office      t enants are
     confirmed. Completion of the hotel improvements is expected in March 2015.

     Site Size:
     Total Area Affected by Development: 5.03 Acres

     Access:
     The site is currently undeveloped and is acce ssed via an unofficial r ock apron area along
     Magrath Darby Boulevard. On the proposed development plan, proposed curb cuts would allow
     restricted right in/right o ut access o n the north and south e nds of the p roject with a full shared
     access located at the center of the Magrath Darby Blvd. frontage.

     Parking Capacities:
     Parking facilities for the development will meet T own of Mount Pleasant requirements for hotels
     and office buildings. The hotel and office building shall be calculated separately as per their use;
     however, parking lot will be shared by both uses (the necessary agreements will be prepared).

     110 Room Hotel Parking Required = 113 spaces
     62,500 SF Office Building Parking Required = 209 spaces
     Total Required Parking = 322 spaces
     Total Provided Parking = 322 spaces (Based on Conceptual Site Plan (see Appendix 3))

     Flood Zone:
     The subject property lies within the Zone AE (ELEV. 13) designated flo od areas as per FEMA
     Flood Map FIRM Co mmunity Pan el #45019C 0517J, Dat ed Novemb er 17, 2004 (revised by
     LOMR dated July 12, 2 013). The p roposed Hot el and Offi ce Building will each ha ve a FFE =
     17.67'; well above the FEMA established base flood elevation of 13'.

     These improvements a re shown on the attach ed Conceptual Site Pla n (see App endix 3). The
     existing conditions are shown on the attached Site Survey (see Appendix 2).

II.   IMPACT ASSESMENT
      Office Building Use = 62,500 GSF
      Hotel Use = 110 rooms (75,000 GSF)
      A. Wastewater
      The projected average daily wastewater to be generated by the new development is ca lculated
      as follows:

      LAND USE                   QUANTITY                   WASTEWATER             WASTEWATER
                                                            GENERATION RATIO       GENERATED (GPD)

      Office Building            62,500 GSF                    8 GPD/100 SF              5,000 GPD

      Hotel                      110 Rooms                    100 GPD/Room              11,000 GPD

      Total                                                                             16,000 GPD


      This is the equivalent of 54 REU's (Residential Equivalent Units, on e REU equates to 300
      GPD). Bas ed on the current impact fee stru cture of $4,50 0.00 per REU, this development will
      generate $243,000.00 in sewer impact fees.
      Sewer service is available for both buildings via existing mains located along the Magrath Darby
      Boulevard.
      A Schematic Master Sewer Plan is attached (see Appendix 5) and is hereby made a part of this
      Development Impact Assessment. All sewer main construction shall be in accord ance with Mt.
      Pleasant Waterworks' requirements, and the system will be deeded to Mt. Pleasant Waterworks
      for ownership and maintenance upon completion and acceptance.

      B. Water      Supply
      The project ed average daily water demand for the Hotel a nd Office Building is 54 REU's, as
      calculated f rom the wa stewater generation. Based on t he current impact fee structure of
      $2,000.00 per REU, this development will generate water impact fees in the        amount of
      $108,000.00.
      Water service is available for both buildings via existing mains located along the Magrath Darby
      Boulevard. Additional fire hydrants will be lo cated throu ghout the p roject as n ecessary to
      provide adequate coverage to all portions of the development.
      A Schematic Master Water Plan is attached (se e Appendix 5) and is hereby made a part of this
      Development Impact Assessment. The syste m will be deeded to Mt. Pleasant Waterworks for
      ownership and maintenance upon completion and acceptance.


      C.      Telephone, Power, and Cable Television
      South Carolina Electric and Gas Co mpany, AT&T, and Comcast Cable will be will be providing
      extensions of power, te lephone, an d cable ser vices, respe ctively, to th e project fro m existing
      lines already provided within the development.

D. Transportation
A Traffic Impact Analysis has been prepared by Bihl         Engineering, LLC for the project,
addressing access to t he development, existing and proposed traffic volumes and distributions,
and the effects of the project on the adjacent roadways (see Appendix 6).
Based on th e Town's cu rrent impact fee structur e, this devel opment will generate $1 66,977.80
in transportation impact fees, based on the following:

LAND USE                   SIZE                       IMPACT FEE RATE         IMPACT FEE

Office Building            62,500 GSF                 $1.10/SF                $68,750.00

Hotel                      110 Rooms                  $892.98/ Room           $98,227.80

Total $166,977.80


E. Drainage
A new proposed stormwater mana gement system c onsisting of a pipe d system will route runof f
to on-site b io swales an d to an on-site detention pond that will ultimately discharge to the larg e
wetland located at the rear of the site. The owner is researching d         ocumentation that ma y
provide an alternative to route runoff across Magrath Darb y Boulevard to an existing detention
pond under a shared pond agre ement. If this a           lternative is pu rsued, calculations an d
documentation will be provided with detailed plans during the DRB plan review process
The post development stormwater runoff from the site will consist of roof drainage from the hotel
and office b uilding, and surface runoff from landscaped an d paved parking areas. All drainage
will be capt ured by inlet structures and will be piped to bio swales and a detention pond where
the stormwater will stored and released at flows comparable to the pre-development runoff. Silt
fence, gravel construct ion entrances, and other BMP's will be installed on the site during
construction.

A Schematic Master Drainage Plan showing on-site detention is attached and is hereby made a
part of this Developme nt Impact Assessment ( see Appendix 4). The drainage facilities design
for the development must be approved by t he Town of Mount Pleasant and SCDHEC-OCRM.
All construction must be in accorda nce with Chapter 155 of the Town o f Mount Ple asant Land
Development Regulatio ns. Building and siting specifications shall comply with Federal Flood
Insurance Regulations.


F. Recreation

As this is a commercial development which will not add to t he population of Mount Pleasant or
to the use of existing facilities, there will be no impact to Town recreational facilities.

G. Education

As this is a commercial development which will not add to t he population of Mount Pleasant or
to the use of existing facilities, there will be no impact to the Charleston County School District.

Gateway Site ­ Magrath Darby Blvd. 


H. Public       Services
Solid wastes generated by the de velopment will be coll ected at planned refuse receptacl e
locations by a private collection co mpany. Theref ore, the re will be n o impact to the Publi c
Works Dep artment of t he Town of Mount Pleasant. How ever, the de velopment will generate
$12,375.00 in Public Services Fees based on $0.09/sf.

I. Police

The Mount Pleasant P olice Depar tment will p rovide police protection for this de velopment.
Taxes and fees generated from this development will fund any required additional personnel, as
well as any equipment, facilit ies, etc. added. Ba sed on the current Municipal Servi ces Impact
Fee for police service, this project will generate $16,500.00 in fees based on $0.12/sf.

J. Fire       Protection

The development will be primarily se rved by To wn of Moun t Pleasant F ire Department Station
No. 3 off Mathis Ferry Road, with secondary protection pr ovided by T own of Mou nt Pleasant
Fire Department Station No. 1 on McCants Drive. Continuing growth could precip itate the nee d
for additional appartatus, staffing, and facilities; however, impact fees and taxes generated by
the development will h elp fund these costs.        The Fire Department portion of the Municipal
Impact Fees total $26,1 25.00 based on $0.19/sf for this development. A Proof of Coordination
letter was obtained from the Mount Pleasant Fire Department (see Appendix 7).

K. Environmen        tal Resources

The proposed development occurs all on high ground and no known wetlands will be impacted.
The office building will be located next to known wetlands that will be preserved and protected
during the construction phase. Select quality trees are shown to be saved.
L.        Cultural and Archaeological Resources

It is not anticipated that this tract p ossesses potential to contain signif icant cultural resources.
Any site that may be discovered during constru ction, however, will be recovered, catalogued,
mitigated, and preserved.

M. Site       Characteristics

The site is unique due to an adjacent property's use as TV station. The TV station property has
a tall tower with guy wire support cables that anchor down into the project site. Easements exist
for these cables to e ncroach on the site, but do not prevent d evelopment of the sit e.
Additionally, the cable heights have been          measured and documented graphically to
demonstrate that they d o not imped e parking lot ai sles or restrict emergency vehic le access.
Supporting documentation has been provided in Appendix 8.

N. Fiscal       Considerations

The development of th is project should broaden the tax     base of both the Town of Moun t
Pleasant and Charleston County.     Based on the current rate struct   ure, and an estimated
investment of $30,000, 000.00 in improvements, the new hotel and office building will ge nerate
$52,700.00 and $326,0 00.00 in an nual propert y taxes for the Town of Mount Pleasant and
Charleston County, res pectively. In addition, the development of      this site will generate


                                                  4 
Development Impact Assessment 
Gateway Site ­ Magrath Darby Blvd. 


$575,793.80 in develop ment impact fees to the Town of Mount Pleasant and Mou nt Pleasant
Waterworks. Building pe rmit fees and plan review fees are expected to total $54,0 00.00 an d
$27,000.00, respectively for this overall project.

A summary of the impact fees to be generated by the development is as follows:

                                              62,500 GSF Office Building +
FEE
                                              110 Hotel Rooms (75,000 GSF)
Sewer Impact Fee                              $243,000.00
Water Impact Fee                              $108,000.00
Traffic Impact Fee                            $166,977.80
Public Services Impact Fee                    $12,375.00
Police Impact Fee                             $16,500.00
Fire Protection Impact Fee                    $26,125.00
General Services Impact Fee                   $5,500.00
Total $578,477.80


O. Housing

As this is a commercial development, it will not add to the population of Mount Pleasant nor will
it affect the Town's housing market.

P.      Mt. Pleasant Comprehensive Plan

The proposed development is located on property located within the boundaries of the
Waterfront Gateway la nd use, as shown the Town's Comprehensive Plan Futu re Land Use
Map. The hotel and of fice building meet the recommenda tions of the Town's Comprehensive
Plan, and will further the Town's objective of creating a vibrant an  d active project for both
residents and visitors on the site. The proposed hotel will provide necessary acco mmodations
to promote tourism and tourism-related indu stries. T he proposed office bui lding will help
promote the growth of existing businesses and recruitment of new businesses.

Furthermore, other following goals and strategies are addressed:

        Implement the Town's Tourism Plan:
             o    Provides a hotel use in an area which provides ease of access to Patriot's Point,
                  a significant tourist destination, and the Mount Pleasant Waterfront Park.
      Land       Use:
             o    Creating de velopment closer to the US 17 and Coleman Blvd. corridor s where
                  there is greater transportation infrastructure.
      Transportation
             o    This site is currently located very ne ar CARTA routes, thus promoting alternative
                  transportation options.

Gateway Development - Traffic Impact Analysis



1.0      Executive Summary

The proposed Gateway development is located on Magrath Darby Boulevard in Mount Pleasant,
SC. The proposed development will include a 62,500 square feet (sf) office building and a 110-
room hotel. Three access points are planned: one full-movement driveway and two right-in, right-
out driveways on Magrath Darby Boulevard.

For the purposes of this Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA), the development is assumed to be
completed by 2015.

This report presents the trip generation, distribution, traffic analyses, and any recommendations
for transportation improvements required to meet anticipated traffic demands. The following
existing intersections were included in this analysis based on discussions with Town staff:

      Johnnie Dodds Boulevard at Magrath Darby Boulevard
      Johnnie Dodds Boulevard at Houston Northcutt Boulevard/Mathis Ferry Road
      Frontage Road at Magrath Darby Boulevard
      Coleman Boulevard at Magrath Darby Boulevard
      Coleman Boulevard at Houston Northcutt Boulevard

As part of the project, a center median will be installed on Magrath Darby Boulevard in the
vicinity of the right-in, right-out driveways to prevent illegal maneuvers at those locations.

Based on the results of the 2015 analysis, no improvements are recommended for the study area
intersections as part of this project.

This project is within the Gateway Sector Plan which is currently being studied by the Town.

4.0        Trip Generation

The trip generation potential of the proposed upgrade was determined using trip generation rates
published in Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)'s Trip Generation, Ninth Edition.

Table 1 summarizes the projected peak hour trips associated with the proposed development.
The development is projected to generate 189 new trips during the AM peak hour (149 entering
and 40 exiting) and 214 new trips during the PM peak hour (59 entering and 155 exiting).

5.0        Site Traffic Distribution

The proposed project traffic was assigned to the surrounding roadway network. The directional
distribution and assignment were based on discussion with staff, knowledge of the area and
existing traffic patterns. Due to the different travel characteristics associated with the two land
uses in this development, separate trip distributions were used for the office and hotel land uses.
Figure 4 shows the project trip distribution.

The following cardinal directional distribution was applied to the office trips:

      30% to/from Johnnie Dodds Boulevard/Coleman Boulevard from the west
      35% to/from Johnnie Dodds Boulevard from the east
      20% to/from Coleman Boulevard from the east
      15% to/from Mathis Ferry Road from the south

Gateway Development - Traffic Impact Analysis



The following cardinal directional distribution was applied to the hotel trips:

      35% to/from Johnnie Dodds Boulevard/Coleman Boulevard from the west
      40% to/from Johnnie Dodds Boulevard from the east
      20% to/from Coleman Boulevard from the east
      5% to/from Mathis Ferry Road from the north



6.0      Traffic Volumes

6.1      Existing Traffic
Peak hour intersection turning movement counts were performed in May 2013 from 7 AM to 9
AM and from 4 PM to 6 PM at the following intersections:

      Johnnie Dodds Boulevard at Magrath Darby Boulevard
      Johnnie Dodds Boulevard at Houston Northcutt Boulevard/Mathis Ferry Road
      Frontage Road at Magrath Darby Boulevard
      Coleman Boulevard at Magrath Darby Boulevard
      Coleman Boulevard at Houston Northcutt Boulevard

The raw turning movement count data is included in the Appendix and the AM and PM peak
hour existing traffic volumes are shown in Figure 5.

6.2      2015 Background Traffic
Historic growth is the increase in existing traffic volumes due to usage increases and non-specific
growth throughout the area. Historically, based on South Carolina Department of Transportation
(SCDOT) Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) data, traffic growth has ranged from 1.5%/year
to 3%/year over the past few years in the study area. Based on discussions with staff, a 2% per
year growth rate was used in the analysis. Trips from the Bridgeside development (January 2012
traffic study) were also added to the background growth as approved development trips.

The 2015 background traffic volumes include existing traffic grown to the buildout year. Figure
6 and Figure 7 show the 2015 background AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes.

6.3      Project Traffic
The AM peak hour and PM peak hour projected project trips were assigned based on the trip
distribution discussed in Section 5.

6.4      2015 Buildout Traffic
The 2015 total traffic volumes include the 2015 background traffic and the proposed development
traffic at buildout. The 2015 AM peak hour and PM peak hour total traffic volumes are shown in
Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively.

Intersection volume development worksheets are included in the Appendix.



7.0      Capacity Analysis

Capacity analyses were performed for the AM and PM peak hours for the existing and 2015
buildout conditions using the Synchro Version 8 software to determine the operating
characteristics of the adjacent road network and the potential traffic impacts of the proposed
development. The analyses were conducted with methodologies contained in the 2010 Highway
Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, December 2010).

Capacity of an intersection is the maximum number of vehicles that can pass through it during a
specified time. Level of Service (LOS) describes the operating characteristics of an intersection.
LOS is defined as a qualitative measure that describes operational conditions and motorist
perceptions within a traffic stream. The Highway Capacity Manual defines six levels of service,
LOS A through LOS F, with A being the best and F being the worst.

LOS is reported for the entire intersection for signalized intersection analysis. LOS for a two-
way stop-controlled (TWSC) intersection is determined by the delay of the poorest performing
minor approach as LOS is not defined for TWSC intersections as a whole.

Capacity analyses were performed for the existing and 2015 buildout traffic conditions for the
following intersections:

The existing conditions analysis shows that all study area intersections are operating at LOS D or
better during the AM and PM peak hours. Some approaches and movements at study area
intersections currently operate at LOS E or LOS F during the peak hours.

The 2015 conditions include improvements to the intersection of Coleman Boulevard at Patriots
Point Boulevard/Magrath Darby Boulevard which will be installed by others. These include the
installation of a second southbound left-turn lane on Coleman Boulevard, the addition of an
eastbound left-turn lane on Magrath Darby Boulevard, and an additional departure lane on

Patriots Point Boulevard. These improvements represent the maximum laneage that can occur at
this intersection within the right-of-way constraints.

The 2015 future year analysis shows that all study area intersections are projected to operate at
LOS D or better with timing adjustments during the AM and PM peak hours. Some intersections
continue to have approaches or movements that are experiencing LOS E or F mainly during the
PM peak hour. As stated above, the maximum improvements for the intersection of Coleman
Boulevard at Patriots Point Boulevard/Magrath Darby Boulevard are already planned to be
implemented.

As part of the this project, a median will be installed along Magrath Darby in the vicinity of the
right-in, right-out driveways to prevent illegal use of those driveways.

Based on SCDOT Design Manual guidelines (Figures 15.5A and 15.5G), exclusive right and left
turn lanes are not necessary at the project driveways.

Capacity analysis reports are included in the Appendix.



8.0      Conclusion

The proposed Gateway development is located on Magrath Darby Boulevard in Mount Pleasant,
SC. The proposed development will include a 62,500 square feet (sf) office building and a 110-
room hotel. Three access points are planned: one full-movement driveway and two right-in, right-
out driveways on Magrath Darby Boulevard.

For the purposes of this Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA), the proposed development is assumed to
be completed by 2015.

Based on the results of the 2015 analysis, no improvements are recommended for the study area
intersections as a result of this project.

This project is within the Gateway Sector Plan which is currently being studied by the Town.

      Dear Ms. Lewis,

      Re: Gateway TMS# 517-00-00-092 & 093

      I have reviewed the site plans for the above referenced project. The Town of Mount
      Pleasant Fire Department should be able to provide adequate fire protection for this
      project once our general requirements have been addressed.

       1. Require compliance with all applicable sections of the International Building,
          Fire, Mechanical and Electrical Codes, the National Fire Protection
          Association fire codes and all Ordinances in effect in Mount Pleasant. You
          are reminded that at minimum your structure shall comply with type IIIB or
          better as detailed in the building code. Your building will be required to have
          an emergency electrical disconnect located on the exterior of the structure
          as detailed by code.

       2. Fire Department requires proper access to facility and grounds for fire
          Suppression needs during construction. Roadways shall be capable of supporting
          fire apparatus of up to 36 ton and shall be so maintained.

       3 Require fire hydrant(s) be located within 300 foot of facility of Mueller three-way
         type with a Storz main connection on minimum eight inch main. Hydrant(s) are
         required to be operational prior to construction and free of obstructions and
         decorative shrubbery. Adequate hydrants to be provided shall comply with fire flow
         requirements of the Insurance Services Office for the facility. The Calculated fire
         flow for your structure shall be 1900 GPMS, based upon size and type construction
         of the structure, as well as plans indicate the facility will be fully sprinklered. Code
         requires that a fire hydrant be located within 150' of the fire department connection.

      Primary protection for the proposed site is provided by the Town of Mount Pleasant Fire
      Department Station No.3 located on Mathis Ferry Road, with secondary protection
provided by Town of Mount Pleasant Fire Department Station No.1 located on McCants
Dr. .

Continuing growth could precipitate the need for additional apparatus, manning, and
facilities.


This letter is not intended to be construed as a plan review and/or acceptance of this
project. The purpose of this correspondence is intended to confirm that we are aware of
the project. Further it will indicate that the fire department can based upon the
preliminary review of the site plans, fire protect same, however, only after a complete
plan review has been completed and it is determined that the project is in complete
compliance with all codes and ordinances in effect in the Town of Mount Pleasant.
 
 
If we can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact us.

 

Sincerely,

      Dear Mr. O'Neal,

      Re: Gateway TMS# 517-00-00-092 & 093


      On December 2, 2013 I met with representatives from the Gateway project to discuss
      their future hotel and office project. During the meeting the owner, engineer, and
      architect presented me with pictures and cross sections of the existing guy wires and
      anchors on the Gateway site. I understand that the wires are used to support a TV
      tower located on the WCBD Channel 2 site and cannot be relocated due to existing
      easements. After the presentation of the information, I looked at the pictures and
      evaluated the cross sections. It appeared that obtaining adequate clearance for fire
      trucks should not be an issue. I informed the owner and engineer that the guy wire
      would need to meet SCDOT minimum bridge clearance requirements. Everyone
      agreed that these clearances could be met and our meeting concluded.

      If I can be of further assistance, please feel free to contact me.


      Sincerely,

To: TOMP Planning
Re: Application for rezoning

My name is John Collins. I am the President of The Board of Directors of the Simmons Pointe HOA. We are a 75 unit
HOA consisting of 55 multifamily condominiums and 20 single family condominiums. Within our PD is also SP2 which
consists of 15 Single family homes. A total of 90 units and approximately 180 citizens.

The Simmons Pointe HOA recently discovered that a section of our property bordering Ben Sawyer Blvd is zoned UC-
OD. We feel that since the rest of the property has been historically one zone (HDN) that it makes sense that the entire
property be uniformly zoned. This front amenity area was the section first developed back in 1985 and is a major asset
and reason why people live here. Building the approximately 34 units that would be allowed under the UC-OD in this
area would totally destroy the character of Simmons Pointe.

This area and in fact the whole of SP is in our opinion fully developed and there is no intention to add more units. The
Northpoint property is a similar situation and they have been excluded from the UC-OD. We are not entirely sure why
we were included and given that Ben Sawyer at this point is a two lane road without a turning lane we would be
subjecting by an increase in density an almost impossible traffic situation to our residents.

The density level in SP has been sufficient for our needs and ease of access to the large swaths of grass land and the
numerous trees and shrubs we consider a great asset. In fact this has been realized by our Neighbors at Sawyers
Landing who have recently purchased the last two units of land available and permitted. They have a serious problem
with access and parking and by absorbing this land into their common area have become fully developed and will
alleviate to a considerable degree the negative problems with the projected density.

Though we cannot speak for the owner of the vacant lot to our north we see where he is on the agenda to change his
zoning to the SP PD. Hopefully he will be allowed to reduce his density and our new neighbors won't have to resort to
an action such as Sawyers Landing had to take in order to increase their access and parking to a manageable level.

John Collins
     Summary for Simmons Pointe application:

1) Our property, as a developed community, was intentionally not included in the Overlay District.
   However, we have more recently become aware that it does have this one small piece which is partly
   in. The "in" part is owned by Simmons Pointe, already fully developed and in use--and has been for
   25-plus years. It's a settled and defined part of the community and not up for further development.

2) Not only do we have no desire to do this, but this would be nearly impossible under our Master Deed.
   We feel it should have the same zoning as the rest of the community and we should have consistent
   standards throughout.

3) Additional concerns were also raised from a Planning Commission member regarding how this split
   zoning might negatively impact us in some unintended ways in the future, either in the area of
   financing or some other aspect of future planning.

4)    We have already addressed the issue of the remaining two lots at neighboring Sawyer's Landing,
     which have now been absorbed into common space by their HOA (see attached letter). They are also
     in full support of our application, as stated. The property to our north already has a vested sketch
     plan.

5)    It is our understanding that it is not typical for a community such as ours to be mostly "out", with a
     small piece "in", and we believe the consistency of this one community zoning is in keeping with the
     intent of the Overlay. There are already examples of other communities that were purposefully not
     included in the Overlay because they were considered already developed (one such example would
     be the Northpoint Community across Ben Sawyer from our community). We feel that same reasoning
     applies to our property. It is a common "living" area, fully developed, with a permanent function and
     longstanding history.

6) We are requesting that we, as owners of this longstanding property, be allowed to return to our
   original HDN zoning throughout our entire community.

Subject: Sawyers Landing plans for the two remaining building lots

John Collins;

Apparently the Mt. Pleasant Planning Commission has a concern that the Simmons
Point rezoning request will impact the adjacent Sawyers Landing property, specifically
the two remaining building lots, known as Sawyers Landing Phase C. While we
appreciate the Commission's concern about Sawyers Landing future plans for these
building lots, current actions taking place make this concern unnecessary.

The Sawyers Landing Owners Association has a signed contract with the Developer,
John Hassell and his firm Seagrass Real Estate and Development, to purchase the land
and developer rights to Sawyers Landing Phase C. The closing is expected to be
completed later this week or early next week pending receipt of a necessary document.
When the deed is registered to the Owners Association it will contain a restriction
prohibiting building, and making the land part of Sawyers Landing Common Elements.
The sole purpose for acquiring this land is to avoid building the remaining two units in
the original Sawyers Landing development plan, and using the land as open space for
the benefit of Sawyers Landing residents. As residents of a "high density" development,
we have come to realize the benefit of having a little open space and the positive benefit
on our quality of life.

Donald Wicks
Treasurer, Sawyers Landing Owners Association

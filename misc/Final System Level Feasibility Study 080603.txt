1.     Introduction
This report documents the information required for the I-25 and Arapahoe Road Interchange
System Feasibility Study, in compliance with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT)
Policy Directive 1601 Interchange Approval Process. This document will be used by CDOT to
evaluate the interchange improvements request.

1.1. Project Location
A partial cloverleaf interchange currently exists at Arapahoe Road and I-25, in the growing
southeast I-25 corridor. Arapahoe Road (SH 88) is located in the southern portion of the
Denver Tech Center and serves as a key east-west regional roadway connection. I-25 runs
north-south through the study area, extending north through Denver and Fort Collins and
south through Colorado Springs. A diamond interchange exists approximately 1 mile north of
Arapahoe Road at Orchard Road, and approximately 1 mile south of Arapahoe Road at Dry Creek
Road. RTD's Southeast Corridor LRT line extends along the west side of I-25 crossing over
Arapahoe Road and the southbound interchange ramps. The project location is illustrated in
Figure 1.

Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                          June 2008


1.2. Purpose for Project
The need for interchange improvements at Arapahoe Road and I-25 has grown substantially
since the 1980's. These needs are based on the analysis and findings documented in separate
documents prepared as part of the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study, including the Existing
Transportation Conditions Report (May 2006), the Land Use and Socioeconomic Data Report (July
2006), the Revised Final Travel Forecast Summary (April 2007), Revised Final Environmental
Overview (April 2007), Final Alternatives Development and Analysis Report (June 2007), and
Final Corridor Report (November 2007).
The goals of this project are to:
       Relieve existing and future congestion along Arapahoe Road and at the I-25/Arapahoe
       Road interchange
       Enhance regional mobility and local accessibility
       Improve the operations and safety of Arapahoe Road, which is operating at over
       capacity, and I-25, which is compromised by ramp backups on the mainline freeway

 1.2.1. Mobility and Congestion
Traffic volumes have increased substantially since the mid 1980's when the last significant
improvements were made to the Arapahoe Road corridor and I-25 Interchange. Highly
congested conditions have historically existed for five to six hours per day, creating significant
queues and delays for travelers using the interchange. Throughout the day, delays along
Arapahoe Road within the interchange area have created queues along the Southbound I-25
off-ramp that back up onto I-25, affecting interstate operations and safety.
Although recent signal timing modifications have improved the progression of ramp traffic
through the interchange and reduced queues along the Southbound I-25 off-ramp, significant
queuing continues along Arapahoe Road at the Boston/Clinton and Yosemite Street
intersections for traffic entering the interchange area. Also, the interchange continues to
operate at peak capacity with the slightest increase in volume or any traffic incident creating
gridlock conditions on Arapahoe Road and the freeway ramps.
Existing traffic volumes at the interchange create operating conditions characterized by
restricted movements and backups. Overall level of service for the interchange area
intersections are classified as LOS D, E, and F (over 80 seconds of average delay per vehicle)
during the AM and PM peak hours, representing potential gridlock conditions. Specific
movements that currently exhibit operational problems include the southbound left turn at the
Southbound I-25 off-ramp and the PM peak queues at the northbound ramp terminal
intersection. The westbound through movement at the Boston/Clinton Street intersection
experiences substantial delays from drivers maneuvering into the right lanes to access I-25.
Operation forecasts with 2030 traffic from projected regional growth degrade to a high level of
congestion. The Northbound I-25 mainline is projected to operate at LOS F in the AM peak
period while the Southbound I-25 mainline is projected to operate at LOS F in the PM peak
period. During the AM peak hour, both ramp terminal intersections are projected to operate at
LOS F and the Yosemite Street intersection is expected to operate at LOS E. During the PM

                                                                    System Level Feasibility Study
Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                         June 2008

peak hour, the Yosemite Street, Northbound I-25 Ramp, and Boston/Clinton Street
intersections are all projected to operate at LOS F. Therefore, without roadway improvements,
in the year 2030 drivers will experience significantly more congestion surrounding the
Arapahoe/I-25 interchange area.

 1.2.2. Safety
The Arapahoe/I-25 interchange experiences the highest crash rate among the interchanges in
the southeast corridor. During the last three years for which data are available, 128 crashes
occurred within the interchange area, representing an economic cost of more than $1.6
million. Even at the slow speeds within the interchange, over 20 percent of these crashes
involved injuries. Most crashes within the interchange area are rear-end collisions resulting
from congestion and queues of vehicles at the ramps and signalized intersections. Travel flow
is interrupted and becomes dangerous as congestion creates unexpected or sudden stops.
Although recent signal timing modifications have improved the typical peak hour operations,
the      current     interchange
configuration operates at peak
capacity and any slight increase
in traffic volumes or incident
causes     vehicles    on    the
Southbound I-25 off-ramp to
back up onto the interstate,
creating hazardous conditions on
I-25, the ramp and Arapahoe
Road.
Poor operations at the I-25
interchange and intersections
along Arapahoe Road currently
cause delays for emergency
vehicles, resulting in longer
response time for incidents on Arapahoe Road and I-25. The retrofit design of Arapahoe Road
under the I-25 and light rail bridges does not provide any area for vehicle breakdown outside
of the travel lanes.
Research conducted by FHWA, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and the National
Highway and Traffic Safety Administration has concluded that as LOS worsens (or congestion
increases), the total crash rate and the severity rate tends to increase. Based on recent CDOT
statewide research (Kononov and others, 2008), it is expected that future growth in traffic and
increases in congestion on I-25 will result in an increase of about 67 percent in the
fatal/injury crash rate and an increase of approximately 8 percent in the rate of total crashes.
Additionally, this research indicates that differences in vehicle speeds, such as a vehicle
entering or exiting the mainline traffic stream from or to a ramp, is correlated to increases in
crash and severity rates.
Projected 2030 operations at both the freeway off-ramp terminal intersections are LOS F during
the AM and/or PM peak hours, resulting in long and unpredictable queues. During peak hour

Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                        June 2008

operations, vehicles attempting to exit I-25 will need to abruptly slow down and come to a
complete stop due to queues extending from the signals onto the I-25 freeway mainline. This
leads to the risk of increased crash and severity rates in the future on the I-25 mainline.

1.3. Project History
The need for an efficient interchange at I-25 and Arapahoe Road has been identified and
studied in previous projects. The following sections give the status of the interchange project
in previous and concurrent planning studies.

 1.3.1. Initial Construction and Subsequent Improvements
The Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange was constructed in conjunction with the initial I-25
"Valley Highway" in the late 1950's. The initial interchange configuration was a simple
diamond interchange. As area development occurred through the 1970's, interchange
modifications were needed to increase interchange capacity. In the mid 1980's, the cloverleaf
loop ramps were constructed in the northwest and southeast quadrants to serve the heavy left-
turning movements onto the freeway. Approach lanes on Arapahoe Road to the new loop
ramps were constructed by removing the slope paving under the I-25 bridge. The construction
of vertical walls beneath the bridge abutments allowed for the loop ramp approach lanes to be
constructed between the bridge piers and the abutment walls. This retrofit interchange has
now been in operation for over 25 years.

 1.3.2. Arapahoe Road Interchange Transportation Analysis for Southeast Corridor Project
This 1999 report of the potential transportation impacts of the Southeast Corridor LRT project
in the area of the Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange provided technical documentation of the
transportation analyses completed for the Southeast Corridor Environmental Impact Statement.
This report documented poor levels of service at the majority of intersections within the
interchange area. It was noted that the 2020 Regional Transportation Plan proposed
improvements to the interchange, but these improvements would not be made as part of the
Southeast Corridor LRT project (eventually known as T-REX). It should be noted that the lack
of improvements at the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange with the T-REX project was based solely on
the limitations of funding, not a lack of need for capacity improvements. Because
improvements to this interchange were included in the Regional Transportation Plan, it was
believed that the improvements could be achieved in the future as a separate project with
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) funding.

1.3.3. T-REX
Construction occurred at the I-25/Arapahoe Road Interchange during the Transportation
Expansion (T-REX) project and, although needs for improvements at the interchange were
recognized, no capacity improvements were made to address the operations of the interchange
due to funding limitations. In conjunction with the construction of the RTD Southeast Light
Rail line, more lanes were added on I-25 and the southbound exit ramp at Arapahoe Road was
modified to accommodate the LRT bridge piers, which made the operations of the exit ramp
worse by introducing sight distance restrictions. The I-25 bridge was widened and aesthetic

                                                                      System Level Feasibility Study
Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                           June 2008

treatments to the bridge façade and landscaping were also completed. A pier for the LRT
structure over Arapahoe Road and the southbound ramps was placed in the median dividing
the eastbound Arapahoe Road through lanes from the lanes leading to the eastbound to
northbound loop ramp. This pier placement was planned to accommodate the future widening
of Arapahoe Road with a shift in centerline to the south.

1.3.4. Arapahoe Road Corridor Study
Current and forecasted traffic volumes and increasing traffic congestion along Arapahoe Road
between I-25 and Parker Road prompted Arapahoe County to initiate a Corridor Study in 2005
to address regional mobility and local accessibility, and to build consensus on a locally
preferred, realistic investment strategy for the timely implementation of recommended
transportation improvements within the study area.
An overall improvement plan was developed in conjunction with this study process to address
the vision for the Arapahoe Road corridor. This vision statement, developed with input from
the Corridor Study's Executive Committee, comprised of local agency elected officials and CDOT,
is as follows:
       "Over the next 20 years and beyond, Arapahoe Road between I-25 and Parker Road
       will serve as a highly effective arterial corridor that meets the needs of commuters,
       employers, residents and the communities it serves. Arapahoe Road will provide a
       balance of improved regional mobility, local accessibility and enhanced safety,
       with minimal impact on neighborhoods, corridor business and the environment".
Project objectives to achieve this vision include:
       Collaborating with local jurisdictions and the public to find creative solutions that will
       consider current transportation plans, comprehensive land use and economic plans.
       Providing roadway and intersection improvements that maintain safe and reliable travel
       through and within the Arapahoe Road corridor, including improvements on other
       nearby corridors that could accommodate a portion of regional traffic.
       Expanding mobility opportunities, including transit, bicycle and infrastructure facilities.
       Accommodating or supporting previous transportation and infrastructure improvements.
       Enhancing the corridor image, design character and identity of places within the
       project corridor.
       Avoiding or minimizing community or environmental impacts resulting from the
       recommended improvements.

1.4. Regional Planning Context
DRCOG, as the designated Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Denver area, is
responsible for developing a regional transportation plan that defines the integrated,
multimodal, metropolitan transportation system. The Metro Vision Plan represents the
preferred regional development and transportation plan, unconstrained by the region's ability
to fund improvements. DRCOG also developed the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), which is


                                                5
                                                                     System Level Feasibility Study
Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                          June 2008

a fiscally-constrained regional transportation plan that includes those transportation facilities
identified in Metro Vision that can be provided through the horizon year based on reasonably
expected revenues. The current Metro Vision Plan and RTP, which were adopted by the DRCOG
in January 2008, are for the horizon year of 2035. However, the forecasts and analyses used
for this study are based on the 2030 Regional Transportation Plan because the study began
before the release of the current RTP. All of the planning context, land use, and travel
forecast information cited in this report are from the 2030 RTP. It is believed the land use and
travel forecasts within the new 2035 RTP would not change the recommendations in this report
and would only reinforce the need for interchange improvements at I-25 and Arapahoe Road.

1.4.1. Regional Growth Forecasts
DRCOG forecasts a 47% population growth, from 2.64 million in 2005 to 3.88 million in 2030,
for the Denver Metropolitan Region. Employment opportunities are expected to increase to
2.36 million by 2030, which is a 51% increase from 2005.
The relative locations of new households and employment between 2005 and 2030 are shown
in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. New households will be distributed throughout the region.
They are expected to form along the edge of the currently developed area as well as at
redevelopment sites and urban centers within the City and County of Denver, the freestanding
communities, and several inner ring suburbs. New employment sites will be concentrated in
several urban centers and corridors oriented along freeways and transit lines. This reflects the
historical trend of employers locating near key transit and highway corridors.
Note that the area surrounding the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange contains many new employment
sites.   These employment forecasts reinforce the need to evaluate and implement
improvements to the transportation system to serve the businesses within the study area.

1.4.2. 2030 Regional Transportation Plan
The 2030 Regional Transportation Plan represents the fiscally-constrained transportation plan
for the region, based on a prioritization of the elements identified in the 2030 Metro Vision.
DRCOG recognizes a commitment to the preferred plan for the region, but considering
reasonably expected revenues, all elements of Metro Vision are not affordable.
Figure 4 illustrates the 2030 RTP Fiscally Constrained Roadway System Improvements. The
plan includes the following improvements that will directly affect the study area:
       New interchange at Arapahoe Road and Parker Road
       Widening of Arapahoe Road from I-25 to Potomac Street
       Reconstruction of I-25/Arapahoe Road interchange
As part of CDOT Policy Directive 1601, it is necessary for the proposed improvements to be
included in the constrained plan. The reconstruction of the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange is
included in the current fiscally-constrained plan. The 2030 RTP is currently being updated to
the 2035 plan, which does not include as many projects as contained in the 2030 RTP. The
draft 2035 RTP does include the I-25/Arapahoe Road interchange improvements.

 1.4.3. Local Plans
The Arapahoe/I-25 interchange reconstruction is consistent with the local communities' long-
range plans. The interchange improvements are identified in the transportation plans of
Arapahoe County, Greenwood Village, and Centennial. Planned land uses surrounding the
interchange include mostly commercial redevelopment. To support the local redevelopment
plans, the interchange improvements should be planned to handle increased levels of traffic.

1.5. Submittal Requirements for Interchange Approval Process
The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) Policy Directive 1601B (PD 1601B) requires
that all requests for new interchanges and improvements to existing interchanges on major
state highways be reviewed and evaluated in a consistent manner through the use of
established guidelines. These guidelines provide general direction regarding the content and
format of information to be provided to CDOT and the Colorado Transportation Commission for
its review during the interchange approval process. The documents that must be provided for
the interchange approval include the System Level Feasibility Study, the appropriate
environmental documentation of any other impacts and consequences of the interchange,
preliminary design, and an Intergovernmental Agreement documenting funding and
maintenance responsibilities.
The System Feasibility Study (SFS) is the first study required through the 1601 process. The
SFS examines general traffic impacts of the new interchange within the context of existing and
planned regional and local transportation facilities. The SFS details any benefits derived from
the proposed improvement for the study area roadways and adjacent interchanges.
The environmental documentation is completed after the SFS and generally in conjunction with
or after the preliminary design, to analyze the physical, social and environmental impacts
associated with the proposed improvements.
The preliminary design of the interchange determines the precise location and extent of traffic
impacts to the state transportation system. This design identifies all necessary improvements
to the interchange and surrounding road system (state and local) to accommodate anticipated
traffic. Preliminary engineering plans at a 20 ­ 30% design level of detail are provided.
An Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) will also be necessary for this project. The City of
Centennial, Greenwood Village, Arapahoe County and CDOT will need to document any funding
and maintenance agreements, and identify any desired construction phasing.
This report presents only the System Feasibility Study for the Arapahoe Road and I-25
Interchange in compliance with CDOT Policy Directive 1601 Interchange Approval Process.

 1.5.1. Public Involvement Process
Potential improvements to the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange were discussed within the public
involvement process for the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study.
The study held four public meetings, to introduce the project and discuss corridor travel
conditions and the need for improvement, to present the range of implementation options, to

present alternatives and preliminary analysis, and discuss the recommended improvements.
The Arapahoe/I-25 interchange analysis and improvements were included in the presentation
at each public meeting.
In an effort to gain as much community input as possible, the study utilized many methods of
advertising and outreach. Each meeting was preceded by a news release, which was sent to
local newspapers and television stations as well as local jurisdictions' Public Involvement
Officers for inclusion in their community bulletins and newsletters. Also, a newsletter was
mailed and e-mailed to businesses and residents in the area surrounding the corridor prior to
each public meeting. Input was solicited at the public meetings and community members were
also able to submit comments via the project website (www.arapahoecorridor.com) throughout
the course of the study.
A Community Resource Panel (CRP) was formed to advise the project team of the concerns of
various groups of stakeholders in the area. The CRP was divided into four separate focus
groups, including representatives from:
       Homeowners' Associations and Neighborhood Associations
       Emergency Providers
       Bicycle and Trails groups
       Businesses, Metro Districts and Chambers of Commerce
The project team worked with the CRP to identify project needs, review proposed improvement
alternatives, discuss likely impacts of improvements and possible mitigation or resolution
techniques, and provide input on project implementation and phasing. The Business, Metro
Districts and Chambers of Commerce CRP were particularly interested in the improvements
planned for the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange area. Comments received at public and CRP
meetings were posted on the website along with answers to frequently asked questions.

1.5.2. Agency Coordination
A series of meetings were also held with local agency representatives that comprised the
corridor study's Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). The committee met approximately every
two months throughout the 18-month study to provide technical input and review of plans and
documents. Specific meetings were held with representatives of the City of Centennial and the
City of Greenwood Village to discuss possible future redevelopment plans for the area
surrounding the I-25 interchange.

2.      Existing Conditions

2.1. Study Area
The study area is located along Interstate 25 (I-25) between the Dry Creek Road and Orchard
Road interchanges. Arapahoe Road is State Highway 88 (SH 88) within the I-25 interchange
area. The Arapahoe Road/I-25 interchange includes six ramp junctions with the current partial
cloverleaf configuration. Arterial intersection operations were examined along Arapahoe Road
through the interchange area from Yosemite Street to Boston Street/Clinton Street. The study
area is located in Arapahoe County and includes the cities of Greenwood Village and
Centennial. In addition, system-level transportation forecasts and plans were examined in a
larger regional level as they relate to the traffic operations along I-25 and Arapahoe Road.

2.2. Existing Land Use
The Arapahoe Road/I-25 interchange is surrounded with office and commercial development,
and includes portions of commercial and office areas in Greenwood Village and the Denver
Technological Center. Today, big box retail uses such as Target, Home Depot and Lowe's
occupy the majority of land near the I-25 interchange. Other land near the interchange is
occupied by smaller scale retail and commercial uses and sections of office-park development.
Southwest and northeast of the interchange predominantly single family residential
development exists. The interchange provides access to several close major regional
destinations, including:
        The Arapahoe at Village Center Light Rail Station is located northeast of the
        interchange at the intersection of Caley Avenue and Yosemite Street and provides
        access to downtown Denver and other regional destinations. This new station built
        with the T-REX project is contributing to the intensification of adjacent office and
        retail employment, and future higher density residential use in Transit Oriented
        Development (TOD) near the station location.
        The Southeast Business Corridor, a major employment center for the Denver
        metropolitan region, surrounds the interchange. The Arapahoe Road interchange is one
        of five interchanges along I-25 (County Line, Dry Creek, Arapahoe, Orchard, Belleview)
        that serves as primary access to the employment area.
        Centennial Airport, located about two miles southeast of the interchange, is the second
        busiest general aviation airport in the United States. Over 2,000 jobs are supported by
        this airport.
        Coors Amphitheatre, located about one mile northwest of the interchange along
        Greenwood Plaza Boulevard, is a regional concert venue with a seating capacity of
        approximately 17,000.
        Over 1,700 hotel rooms are located within a half-mile of the interchange.

2.3. Existing Roadway Network
The existing Arapahoe Road/I-25 interchange is a partial cloverleaf configuration in which the
westbound to southbound and
the eastbound to northbound
movements        through       the
interchange are accommodated
via loop ramps.       Below I-25,
Arapahoe Road provides only two
through lanes in each direction
between the bridge piers, plus
lanes north and south of the
bridge piers to accommodate
traffic bound traffic for the loop
ramps. Upon approaching I-25,
drivers must pay close attention
to the specific lane they are
traveling since the outside
through lane in each direction
forces traffic onto the ramps
entering I-25.
Through the I-25 interchange, traffic signals are spaced every 600 to 900 feet. Four traffic
signals comprise the I-25 interchange complex including Yosemite Street at the west end, the
southbound off-ramp intersection, the northbound off-ramp intersection, and the Clinton
Street/Boston Street intersection. One-quarter mile is provided from the Clinton Street/Boston
Street to Dayton Street signalized intersection to the east of the interchange.
The traffic signals through the interchange area and along the Arapahoe corridor are
coordinated by time of day via a central computer system. The signal cycle lengths are 120
seconds during the AM and PM peak periods and 100 seconds during the rest of the day,
including the noon peak period.
I-25 ­ This is a major interstate highway facility through the Denver Metropolitan area and
Colorado. Near Arapahoe Road, I-25 provides five through lanes in each direction following
completion of recent improvements as part of the T-REX transportation expansion project.
Arapahoe Road (SH 88) ­Arapahoe Road is a major regional arterial extending east-west
through the southeast Denver Metropolitan area from Broadway to Smokey Hill Road east of E-
470. It is a state highway (SH 88) between I-25 and Parker Road (SH 83). The roadway
consists of three lanes of traffic east and west of I-25, with only two lanes in each direction
carried through the interchange.
Havana Street ­ Located about one mile east of the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange, Havana Street
is a six-lane facility extending south and curving into Dry Creek Road. The Dry Creek/I-25
interchange serves as a convenient southern alternate connection to I-25 for the study area.
Peakview Avenue - This is a two-lane east-west facility located north of and within one-
quarter mile of Arapahoe Road. Its western terminal is at Yosemite Street where it "dead ends"

into commercial development near I-25. From here, the road extends east one mile to Havana
Street where it curves south and intersects with Arapahoe Road (as Havana Street) part of
Greenwood Village's "Serpentine Road".
Orchard Road ­ One mile north of Arapahoe Road is the parallel facility of Orchard Road. This
roadway has an interchange with I-25 and extends east 2.5 miles to Peoria Street. This is a
four-lane arterial roadway just east of I-25 that transitions to a two-lane road east of DTC
Boulevard and then to a two-lane residential collector street east of Dayton Street.
Yosemite Street ­ This is a major north-south four-lane arterial roadway that intersects
Arapahoe Road immediately west of I-25. This facility extends south through the Park
Meadows retail area and continues south to Lincoln Avenue in Douglas County. North of
Arapahoe Road, the roadway crosses over I-25, provides access to the Arapahoe at Village
Center Light Rail Station, and becomes DTC Boulevard within the Denver Tech Center. This
road interchanges with I-225 nearly three miles north of Arapahoe Road.
Boston/Clinton Street ­ This north-south roadway, immediately east of I-25, provides access
to a variety of facilities within the study area. North of Arapahoe Road, Boston Street has four
travel lanes up to Caley Avenue, one-half mile north of Arapahoe Road. This segment provides
access to adjacent businesses but also serves as the prime connection to Yosemite Street (via
Caley Avenue) as part of Greenwood Village's "Serpentine Road". South of Arapahoe Road,
Clinton Street also provides access to nearby businesses in the form of an I-25 Frontage Road.
It extends two miles south and terminates at County Line Road (as Inverness Drive West).
Costilla Avenue ­ About one-quarter mile south of Arapahoe Road is Costilla Avenue, which
parallels Arapahoe Road as a collector roadway east of the interchange, beginning at Clinton
Street. East of Havana Street the road becomes Briarwood Avenue, which extends one-half
mile east to Lima Street. This road is discontinuous between Lima and Peoria Streets, then is
reestablished east of Peoria Street and extends as far east as Jordan Road. The roadway cross-
section varies from two lanes to four lanes.
Figure 5 depicts the surrounding area roadway network and the existing lane configuration at
intersections in the study area.

2.4. Existing Traffic Volumes
Traffic count data within the interchange area were collected for the Arapahoe Road Corridor
Study during January 2006. The traffic count data are included in Appendix A.
Historic traffic volumes within the interchange area were obtained from Arapahoe County and
CDOT. As shown in Table 1, there was an effect on the traffic volumes from 2001 to 2002
within the I-25 area from the commencement of the T-REX construction and the volumes on
Arapahoe Road east of I-25 decreased over ten percent before rebounding somewhat in 2003.
There has been substantial growth in traffic traveling on I-25 and Arapahoe Road through the
interchange area in the last two years.

As shown in Figure 6, the daily traffic volumes on Arapahoe Road immediately east of the I-25
interchange are distributed almost equally in the eastbound and westbound directions
throughout the day. The noon peak period traffic volumes at this location are generally as
high as the traffic volumes experienced during the typical AM and PM commuting periods,
which creates lunch hour traffic congestion surrounding the retail and eating establishments
around the interchange.

2.5.    Existing Operational Analysis
Operational analysis was completed utilizing methods outlined in the latest Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM 2000). Intersection operations were analyzed using Synchro software. Freeway
segment and merge/diverge analysis was completed with Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Level of Service (LOS) is a measure of the quality of traffic flow and level of congestion on a
roadway or intersection, measured on a scale from A to F. For signalized intersections, LOS is
defined by the average control delay per vehicle. LOS A indicates very low control delay,
averaging less than ten seconds per vehicle. LOS F indicates highly congested conditions with
control delay in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle at the intersection. LOS D or better is often
viewed as the realistic optimal operation for peak hour level of service in urbanized areas.
For basic freeway sections, level of service is defined by the maximum allowable density. LOS
A describes free-flow operations where vehicles are almost completely unimpeded in their
ability to maneuver within the traffic stream. LOS F indicates breakdowns in vehicular flow
caused by traffic incidents or points of recurring congestion. The ramp merge and diverge
level of service analysis is based on the density in the ramp influence area, defined as 1500
feet downstream (or upstream) from the physical merge (or diverge) point. LOS A represents
unrestricted operations and LOS F represents unstable operation in which queues are formed on
the freeway and ramps and continue to grow as approaching demand flows exceed the
discharge capacity of the downstream freeway.
CDOT recently collected new peak hour turning movement volumes within the interchange area
for a signal timing and short-term improvements project. These recent traffic volumes were
compared with the volumes previously collected for this project and the movements to the
Northbound I-25 entrance ramp and from the Southbound I-25 off ramp were substantially
higher, while the movements from the Northbound I-25 off ramp were substantially lower. All
other movements at the interchange intersections remained generally consistent. The traffic
volumes for this project were updated only for the movements to and from the ramps that
showed large differences.
The existing lane configurations, balanced peak hour traffic volumes, and current signal
timings were used to analyze the LOS at each interchange area intersection, ramp
merge/diverge, and freeway segment during the AM and PM peak hours. The freeway and ramp
operations are based on the current lane configuration of I-25, which consists of five general
purpose travel lanes in each direction with outside auxiliary lanes between interchanges.
The existing peak hour traffic volumes and results of the peak hour analyses are illustrated in
Figure 7 and summarized in Table 2. To simplify the illustration, the freeway segment and
merge/diverge LOSs shown in the figure are for the peak hour in the peak direction
(northbound during the morning peak hour and southbound during the evening peak hour).
Output reports for the existing operational analysis are provided in Appendix B.
The intersections at Yosemite Street and the Southbound I-25 off ramp were calculated to
operate at LOS D or LOS E during the peak hours analyzed based on HCM methodology.
Highway Capacity Manual methods are the preferred standard methodology for traffic
operations analysis. However, the HCM methodology for signalized intersections does not take
into account the interaction of closely-spaced intersections, such as within this interchange

area. It should be noted that while the level of service for the Southbound I-25 exit ramp and
Arapahoe Road intersection is shown to be LOS E and LOS D during the morning and evening
peak hours, the queues along the Southbound I-25 off ramp occasionally back up from the
signalized intersection onto the freeway mainline, a distance of approximately 1000 feet.
These queues are due to the capacity constraints for through traffic along Arapahoe Road. The
traffic queues at the downstream intersections on Arapahoe Road (at Yosemite Street or at
Boston/Clinton Street), back up through the ramp intersections during some signal cycles
during the peak hours, even with the recent signal timing improvements.

The Northbound I-25 off-ramp terminal intersection operates at LOS C during the AM peak hour
and LOS B during the PM peak hour. The Arapahoe Road and Boston Street/Clinton Street
intersection operates at LOS E during the AM and PM peak hours. Due to the large amount of
traffic bound for the Northbound and Southbound I-25 on ramps, much of the traffic traveling
through these intersections is in the two right westbound lanes on Arapahoe. The outside lane
is added at the Boston Street/Clinton Street intersection and the right lane on Arapahoe Road
often backs up through the Dayton Street signal, located approximately a quarter mile east of
Boston Street/Clinton Street.
The recent T-REX improvements have reduced congestion on the I-25 freeway. The freeway
segments and merge/diverges operate at LOS D or better during the peak hours, except the
diamond entrance ramp merges, which operate at LOS F due to heavy freeway volumes.
All four I-25 on ramps are controlled with ramp meters during the AM and PM peak hours.
Although queues do not consistently back up to Arapahoe Road, the queues do fully utilize the
ramps for storage.

2.6. Interim Improvements Operational Analysis
An interim operational improvements project is being planned for the Arapahoe Road/I-25
interchange, currently in the final design process by CDOT. The improvements are being
funded through "TREX contingency funds". The improvements within the interchange area will
include:
         An additional eastbound and westbound through lane on Arapahoe Road through the
         ramp intersections on the outside of the existing bridge piers and barriers that will tie
         into the outside lanes approaching the Yosemite Street and Boston/Clinton Street
         intersections
         A westbound right turn lane under the bridge from the new through lane outside the
         bridge piers and barrier to the Southbound I-25 loop ramp (This right turn lane will
         begin just west of the existing lanes leading to the Northbound I-25 entrance ramp)
         A free-flow southbound right turn lane from the Southbound I-25 exit ramp that will
         drop as a westbound right turn lane at Yosemite Street
         Modifications to the barrier median on the east leg of the Southbound I-25 exit ramp
         intersection to provide more room for truck traffic turning left from the exit ramp onto
         eastbound Arapahoe Road
         Additional advanced signage with overhead sign structures on Arapahoe Road east and
         west of the interchange
The lane configurations of the interchange intersections with the interim improvements are
illustrated in Figure 8. The proposed interim improvements were analyzed with the balanced
peak hour traffic volumes and optimized signal timings. The results of the peak hour analyses
are summarized in Table 3. These results show that the interim improvements will provide a
benefit to the interchange traffic operations in the short term, particularly at the Southbound
I-25 exit ramp and Yosemite Street intersections.

2.7. Crash History
Crash data along Arapahoe Road were obtained from CDOT for 2001-2003 (the latest data
available at the beginning of this study). Rates and summaries were calculated for the I-25
interchange. The crash rates are summarized in Table 4.

Note: Property Damage Only (PDO) and Injury rates reported per Million Vehicle Miles Traveled (MVMT) and Fatal
      rate reported per 100 Million Vehicle Miles Traveled (100 MVMT)

The severity of crashes is summarized in Table 5. Due to the slow speeds experienced through
the interchange with recurring traffic congestion, the percentage of crashes involving injuries
within the interchange area (20%) is lower than the percentage of injury crashes at typical
three and four-legged intersections within Colorado (27-31%).

Most crashes (46 percent) were rear end crashes, which is consistent with the number of
signalized intersections in the area and the recurring congestion. About 25 percent of the
crashes were broadside crashes and about 20 percent of the crashes were side swipe same
direction. There were no crashes in the interchange area involving pedestrians and bicyclists
during the years studied.

Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                         June 2008


2.8. Engineering Opportunities and Constraints
The current Arapahoe/I-25 interchange does not have adequate capacity to accommodate
traffic volumes today or into the future. Arapahoe Road currently contains three lanes
approaching the interchange in each direction, but only two lanes are carried eastbound and
westbound through the interchange, which severely limits the capacity of the interchange.
The location of the light rail bridge recently constructed with the Transportation Expansion (T-
REX) project along the west side of I-25 highly constrains the options for the interchange,
particularly the Southbound I-25
exit and entrance ramps and the
potential modification of the
Arapahoe       Road      horizontal
alignment. A pier for the LRT
structure over Arapahoe Road was
placed in the median dividing the
eastbound       Arapahoe       Road
through lanes from the lanes
leading to the eastbound to
northbound loop ramp. This pier
placement was planned to
accommodate future widening of
Arapahoe Road with a shift in
centerline     to    the     south.
However, the existing I-25 bridge
over Arapahoe Road, widened for additional lanes on I-25 with the T-REX project, cannot
accommodate widening Arapahoe Road.
An abutment for the LRT structure straddles the Southbound I-25 exit ramp at Arapahoe Road.
                                                          This straddle bent has reduced the
                                                          sight distance for vehicles exiting
                                                          the freeway and approaching the
                                                          signal at Arapahoe Road, which
                                                          has hindered the ramp operations.
                                                          The bent also greatly limits the
                                                          options     for   improving     the
                                                          Southbound I-25 off-ramp layout
                                                          without reconstructing the LRT
                                                          bridge.

2.9. Local and Property Access
The existing roadways within the interchange area are shown in Figure 9. West of I-25, right
turn only intersections exist along both the north and south sides of Arapahoe Road between
I-25 and Yosemite Street. The South Yosemite Court right turn only intersection on the north
side serves commercial development (primarily fast-food restaurants) in the northwest
quadrant of the interchange. South Yosemite Court extends north in a curvilinear alignment
from Arapahoe Road to South Yosemite Circle, which intersects with South Yosemite Street at a
signalized intersection, and further to an unsignalized intersection with South Yosemite Street.
The South Xanthia Court right turn only intersection along the south side of Arapahoe Road
west of I-25 extends south to an unsignalized intersection with South Yosemite Street. The
roadway serves the commercial development (primarily sit-down restaurants and auto service
centers) in the southwest quadrant of the interchange. Further south along South Yosemite
Street, additional access is provided to the southwest quadrant commercial development,
including two private driveways to the Southgate Shopping Center, and South Yosemite Court
which serves office development near I-25.
East of I-25, only one access exists between I-25 and the South Boston Street/Clinton Street
intersection. This access is located along the north side of Arapahoe Road opposite the
Northbound I-25 off-ramp. Northbound off-ramp traffic can travel straight north to this access
road, but southbound traffic is restricted to right turn only movements. No left turns are
permitted from eastbound Arapahoe Road into this access road. The road extends north in a
curvilinear alignment to East Southtech Drive, and provides access to hotels and big box
development in the northeast quadrant of the interchange.

2.10. Alternate Transportation Modes

2.10.1. Transit
The existing transit services in the vicinity of the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange were detailed in
the Existing Transportation Conditions Report (May 2006) prepared in conjunction with the
Arapahoe Road Corridor Study. Nearby transit services and facilities are focused on the
Arapahoe at Village Center park-n-Ride, located north of the interchange at Caley Avenue and
Yosemite Street, and the Arapahoe LRT Station. The station platform is on the west side of I-
25 and is served by a pedestrian bridge over the interstate leading to the park-n-Ride on the
east side.
Arapahoe Crosstown (Route 66) is the east-west local bus route that serves destinations along
Arapahoe Road. It runs from the LRT/Littleton Downtown Station (along the Southwest LRT
Corridor) east along Arapahoe Road to Parker Road, and south on school days to the Pinery
park-n-Ride. In the vicinity of the I-25/Arapahoe interchange, the route uses Yosemite Street
north of Arapahoe Road to transfer passengers at the Arapahoe LRT Station, then Caley Avenue
to Boston Street to continue east on Arapahoe Road. Therefore, the buses turn at the
Yosemite Street and Boston/Clinton Street intersections and do not travel through the ramp
intersections within the interchange area.
Other routes in the interchange vicinity include Route 465 ­ South Yosemite, Route 727 ­ DTC
Boulevard, Route 169 L ­ Buckley/Tower/DIA, and the Arapahoe call-n-Ride (Route 1409).

These routes use Yosemite Street, Clinton Street, Boston Street and Caley Avenue in the
vicinity of the I-25/Arapahoe interchange.
None of the existing transit routes serving the area travel directly through the Arapahoe/I-25
interchange, but rather travel around the interchange to efficiently access the Arapahoe LRT
Station and Arapahoe at Village Center park-n-Ride.

2.10.2. Pedestrians and Bicyclists
Pedestrian and bicycle conditions in the vicinity of the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange were
summarized in the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study Existing Transportation Conditions Report (May
2006). Also, in conjunction with that study, Community Resource Panel meetings with area
bicycle advocates were held to gain information on existing bicyclist activities and concerns.
Although sidewalks exist along Arapahoe Road through the interchange, little pedestrian
activity has been observed. Pedestrians must negotiate through the high traffic volume area
and cross the free-flowing traffic movements of the loop ramps in the northwest and southeast
quadrants of the interchange. In order to facilitate the peak hour signal timing through the
interchange area, the pedestrian timing to cross Arapahoe Road at the Northbound I-25 off-
ramp was recently removed. Due to the existing barrier to separate Eastbound Arapahoe traffic
bound for I-25, there is also no pedestrian crosswalk across Arapahoe Road at the Southbound
I-25 off-ramp.
Separate bike lanes or widening of general purpose lanes do not exist along Arapahoe Road
through the confined, retrofit interchange area. In discussion with area bicycle advocates,
bicyclists currently choose to avoid the Arapahoe Road corridor and the Arapahoe/I-25
interchange and instead use Yosemite Street and the Yosemite Street overpass of I-25 to
negotiate around the interchange area.

3.      Environmental Issues

3.1. Environmental Overview
An environmental overview was conducted as part of the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study to
identify the potential environmental issues that may influence the type, locations or design of
the alternatives forwarded for further evaluation in this study and in future environmental
evaluation processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
In the environmental overview report, each resource is described in terms of existing conditions,
the potential impacts from a range of possible alternatives and the potential mitigation or Best
Management Practices that could reduce or eliminate impacts. The major findings of the
analysis within the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange area are discussed below.
Air Quality: Motor vehicles are a major source of air pollutants in the interchange area,
particularly those pollutants that have been problematic for the larger Denver metropolitan
area. Pollutant hot-spots can exist around a congested intersection. There are local changes
that could be used individually or collectively to reduce local pollutant emissions, such as
signal timing or the number of driving lanes. For the range of speeds within the Arapahoe/I-
25 interchange area, any changes that will reduce vehicle idling time or increase average
vehicle speeds will reduce pollutant emissions from mobile sources.
Improvements to the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange were included in the DRCOG 2030 Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP), which was subject to air quality conformity analysis. During the
future NEPA process for this project, carbon monoxide hot-spot analysis will be conducted as
required.
Hazardous Materials: Several potential hazardous material sites were identified within the
general area of the interchange area. Most of these sites are outside of the impact area of the
interchange configuration options. The sites include automotive service stations, storage
units, and commercial facilities.
Contributors of potential contamination within the general interchange area include:
        9138 E. Arapahoe Road (east of interchange) ­ Gasoline station with open liquid
        petroleum gas tank.
        9301 E. Arapahoe Road (east of interchange) ­ Automobile dealership and service with
        an UST and a closed LUST (November 1991).
        9171 E. Arapahoe Road (east of interchange) ­ Gasoline station with seven USTs and
        one active LUST (1990).
        6767 S. Clinton Street (southeast of interchange) ­ Commercial facility with no
        violations.
        9250 E. Costilla Avenue (southeast of interchange) ­ Industrial/commercial facility with
        backup diesel generator.
        9600 E. Costilla Avenue (southeast of interchange) ­ Storage units with potential for
        methamphetamine lab activity. No such activity reported.

Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                          June 2008

       6802 S. Yosemite Street (southwest quadrant of interchange) ­ Gasoline station with
       three open gasoline Underground Storage Tanks (USTs) and one closed Leaking
       Underground Storage Tank (LUST) (March 2001).
       6900 S. Yosemite Street (southwest quadrant of interchange) ­ Commercial facility with
       no violations.
       6770 S. Yosemite Street (southwest quadrant of interchange) ­ Automotive station with
       vehicle maintenance bays. Unknown material handling and disposal practices.
       Potential materials include: fuel, motor oils, hydraulic fluids, degreasers, paints, and
       solvents. No reported soil and groundwater contamination.
There are two leaking underground storage tank (LUST) sites within 100 feet of right-of-way in
the interchange study area. One of these sites is still active and one site has been closed and
clean-up has been completed. The active LUST site is located along Arapahoe Road east of the
interchange and west of Boston Street (9171 East Arapahoe Road).
Historic and Archaeological Resources: Historic and archeological resources are tangible
remains of past human activity and include sites, buildings, structures, districts, features and
artifacts at least 45 years old. To warrant consideration of impacts in a federally-assisted or
sponsored transportation project, historic and archeological resources must be listed on, or
meet the eligibility criteria established for, the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). A
file search, literature review, aerial photo review, and reconnaissance "windshield" survey
revealed no previously recorded significant historic or prehistoric resources within the
Arapahoe/I-25 interchange area.
Environmental Justice: U.S. Census data (year 2000) was evaluated to better understand the
potential impacts of a future project to minority and/or low-income populations and as a basis
for outreach methods to those populations during a future NEPA process. The Census block
south of Peakview Avenue and north of Dry Creek Road, between I-25 and Havana Street has
minority populations higher than the county they are located within (Arapahoe or Douglas
County) and a higher percentage of individuals living in poverty compared to the county
percentage.
During the future NEPA process for this project, data on low-income and minority populations
will be updated and the extent to which any populations may be affected will be identified.
The interchange improvements will be designed to avoid impacts to these populations to the
extent feasible. If impacts to these populations cannot be avoided, mitigation measures will
be identified to reduce impacts and coordination with affected groups will be conducted to
identify the best means for reducing such impacts.
Section 4(f)/6(f) Resources: No potential Section 4(f)/6(f) resources were identified within
the study area near or adjacent to the interchange roadways that could be improved as part of
this project.
Biological Resources: Existing data on wildlife, wetlands and special status species that are
known to occur or may potentially occur within the interchange area were collected from a
variety of data sources including Arapahoe County, the USFWS county list of federally listed
species, and the Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW) list of state listed species and species of

concern. A visual survey of wildlife and special status species habitat and potential wetland
areas was also conducted.
A small area of wetland vegetation was identified in the southeast quadrant of the interchange
between the existing Target and hotel sites west of the Clinton Street and Costilla Avenue
intersection. The majority of the Arapahoe Road corridor is occupied with noxious weeds,
including diffuse knapweed and leafy spurge.
Any necessary wildlife surveys may be conducted during the environmental documentation for
the project in accordance with CDOW survey protocol. A weed management plan is warranted
to prevent the spread of noxious weeds within the study area.
Water Resources: The Study Area is located within the Cherry Creek Watershed. This watershed
is nearly fully developed in the northern reaches and transitions southward to a more sparse
development including farmsteads, open land and large lot residential areas. Cherry Creek is a
right bank tributary to the South Platte River and is located within Denver, Arapahoe, Douglas
and El Paso Counties. Cherry Creek Reservoir is located northwest of the interchange area and
is a major water feature within the watershed. The reservoir is the main attraction for Cherry
Creek State Park and is used extensively for boating and fishing. It provides a habitat for a
diverse variety of animal species and vegetation. All of the drainages along Arapahoe Road
east of the interchange are within the Cherry Creek Basin and all are tributary to Cherry Creek
Reservoir. The area is controlled by the Cherry Creek Basin Water Quality Authority (CCBWQA).
The CCBWQA has requirements for projects such as transportation improvements to improve the
water quality within the basin. Phosphorus loads are a primary concern; storm runoff transports
most of the phosphorus within the watershed. Stormwater issues include stormwater runoff
control on construction sites and post-construction stormwater management.
The Arapahoe/I-25 interchange is in the Urban Drainage District which administers the
floodplain modifications for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated
floodplains. The Arapahoe County Stormwater Authority and local city floodplain administrators
conduct the initial review for proposed floodplain impacts and determine if Urban Drainage
and FEMA coordination is necessary. Any improvement of a drainage structure that lies within
a FEMA administered floodplain will probably require this coordination.
Noise: Traffic volumes are likely to increase in the future within the Arapahoe/I-25
interchange area even without the proposed project, and this would likely increase the traffic
noise to neighboring properties. The current land uses adjacent to the interchange area are
generally Category B (homes, hotels, parks, etc.) and Category C (commercial). Category B is
the most noise sensitive and there are several Category B properties within 500 feet of the
proposed interchange construction area. There are approximately 45 homes west of the
Arapahoe Road/Yosemite Street intersection and about 20 homes located near the Yosemite
Street/Alton Way intersection. There are three hotels in the southwest quadrant of the
interchange and one hotel in the northeast quadrant of the interchange.
Any changes to study area roads that would increase traffic volumes or move the roads closer
to any current receivers would also likely increase the traffic noise at the receivers. Whether
any of these changes would cause a traffic noise impact according to CDOT criteria would need
to be assessed through a more thorough noise analysis during the future NEPA process for this
project.

Geology and Paleontological Resources: The Arapahoe/I-25 interchange area contains the
Louviers Alluvium geologic unit. The paleontological sensitivity of this geologic unit was
evaluated using the Potential Fossil Yield Classification system and identified as a Class 2 unit.
Class 2 units are sedimentary geologic units that are not likely to contain vertebrate fossils or
scientifically significant invertebrate (or plant) fossils. Ground-disturbing activities are not
likely to require mitigation.

3.2. Environmental Clearance Streamlining
The Arapahoe Road Corridor Study was conducted following FHWA/FTA guidance regarding the
integration of transportation planning and the NEPA process, which encourages the use of
planning studies to provide information for incorporation into NEPA documents. The goal of
this early integrated planning effort is to streamline subsequent alternatives analysis during
the NEPA clearance work for individual projects, such as the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange
improvements.
Although the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study is a planning study and does not yet include NEPA
clearance, the following steps were taken to streamline the future NEPA process:
       Developing a vision statement and objectives that readily translate to a project Purpose
       and Need,
       Conducting evaluation and documentation of a broad range of alternatives and the
       screening process to narrow preferred alternatives,
       Identifying logical termini for the study corridor, and identifying segments with
       independent utility for potential future NEPA clearances within fiscally constrained
       budgets,
       Including public and agency input during the study process,
       Conducting an environmental overview of resources potentially affected by the range of
       options, and
       Requesting concurrence by the Executive Committee at key decision points that mesh
       with those of the NEPA process:
           -   Vision statement and objectives,
           -   Range of alternatives,
           -   Major screening criteria, and
           -   Identification of a recommended option.
These steps were documented in various formats (meeting notes, public meeting materials,
project memos and reports) that may be included as background reference as the
transportation planning process transitions into NEPA clearance projects.

4.      Future Conditions

4.1. Forecasting Approach
Traffic forecasts for the interchange were developed with the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study.
The 2030 Denver Regional Council of Governments' (DRCOG's) regional travel demand
forecasting model, Version 94, was used as a basis for developing year 2030 forecasts for the
corridor study. This version of the regional model incorporates DRCOG's recent improvements
to several aspects of the modeling process, including the forecasting of traffic on tollways.
The travel forecast methodology and results are documented in the Arapahoe Road Corridor
Study Revised Final Travel Forecasts Summary (April 2007).
The regional model includes the fiscally-constrained 2030 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)
as its basis. The planned interchange at Arapahoe Road/Parker Road is included in the 2030
RTP and it has been included in the baseline Arapahoe Road corridor modeling. The other
major improvement to the Arapahoe Road corridor roadway network included in the 2030 RTP
is widening to eight lanes between I-25 and Potomac Street. This widening was not included
in the baseline modeling, since it represents an alternative analyzed in the corridor study.
The DRCOG Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) zonal structure was imposed over the study area,
defining the 112 TAZs within the boundaries of the Arapahoe Road land use study area.
Due to the complexity of real-world driver behavior and individual roadway characteristics,
travel demand forecasting models cannot be expected to result in precise representations of
traffic volumes on each roadway. A common technique used to improve the reliability of travel
demand forecasts is referred to as post-processing adjustment. This technique uses
comparisons of the base year (2005) model's predicted traffic volumes versus actual traffic
counts (which are documented in the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study Existing Transportation
Conditions Report). These comparisons provide estimations of the error associated with the
model's representation of travel conditions. The model-produced forecasts are then adjusted
to account for the errors found in the model to provide more reliable forecasts. This post-
processing adjustment process, as prescribed in the Transportation Research Board's
publication NCHRP 255, was applied to the Arapahoe Road Corridor traffic forecasts.

4.2. Land Use
The I-25 interchange area has developed and will continue to develop in a high density land
use pattern because of the regional access offered by I-25. The relatively recent construction
of the Southeast Corridor Light Rail will contribute to further higher density development and
redevelopment, with the potential for a significant amount of high density residential and
commercial mixed use development influenced by light rail transit. Current development plans
for the area include:
        The Greenwood Village Center is a 2 million square foot development planned north of
        the interchange that will include 1,600 new homes, over 350 hotel rooms, shopping,
        entertainment and open space, serving as a downtown core of the city.

       A 1.1 million square foot redevelopment project called Streets at Southglenn will
       convert the Southglenn Mall, located about 3.5 miles west of the interchange along
       Arapahoe Road, into an urban neighborhood with new homes and retail expansion.
       Centennial is planning a mixed use community called the Centennial City Center. This
       will be located along Arapahoe Road about three miles east of the interchange in a
       main street configuration with 200,000 square feet of retail and 600 new homes.

4.3. 2030 Roadway Network
The roadway network from the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study 2030 No Build model included the
following roadway network improvements within the study area over existing conditions:
       New interchange at Arapahoe Road and Parker Road
The DRCOG 2030 model network includes the widening of Arapahoe Road from I-25 to Potomac
Street. This improvement was removed to create the 2030 No Build model roadway network for
the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study and this I-25 Interchange System Level Feasibility Study.
The 2030 general roadway network within the study area used for the traffic forecasts is shown
in Figure 10. The 2030 No Build analysis also included the interim lane configuration
improvements, as described in Section 2.6 of this report, which are planned for construction
within the interchange area within the next couple of years.

4.4. 2030 No Build Traffic Forecasts
No Build 2030 traffic forecasts from the modeling and adjustment process are shown in Figure
11. Significant traffic growth is expected on the roadways surrounding the Arapahoe/I-25
interchange, even without the widening of Arapahoe Road to eight lanes from I-25 to Potomac
Street. The following is a summary of forecasted traffic volume growth on the corridor and
surrounding roadway system:
       I-25: I-25 volumes are forecast to increase by more than 50 percent by 2030, to reach
       levels of approximately 270,000 to 290,000 in the vicinity of Arapahoe Road.
       Arapahoe Road: West of the interchange, traffic volumes on Arapahoe Road are
       expected to increase almost 40 percent over existing levels while traffic volumes are
       expected in increase about 20 percent east of the interchange.
       Boston Street/Clinton Street: Traffic projections on Boston Street/Clinton Street are
       expected to increase about 10 percent north of Arapahoe Road and increase
       approximately 20 percent over existing levels south of Arapahoe Road.
       Yosemite Street: Traffic volumes on Yosemite Street are expected to increase
       approximately 50 percent north of Arapahoe Road and about 60 percent south of
       Arapahoe Road.

4.5. 2030 No Build Operational Analysis
To conduct traffic operational analysis of 2030 conditions, turning movement forecasts were
developed using a combination of data from existing traffic counts, forecasted daily traffic,
and forecasted peak hour traffic. Intersection, freeway segment, and ramp merge/diverge
levels of service analyses were performed using the 2030 No Build traffic projections and
roadway network. Figure 11 shows the AM and PM peak hour traffic forecasts and Figure 12
illustrates the Levels of Service (LOS) calculated for the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange area.
Analysis worksheets are included in Appendix C.
The analysis shows that, even with the interim interchange improvements, three of the four
signalized intersections along Arapahoe Road are expected to operate at LOS F during the AM
and/or PM peak hours by 2030. The Southbound I-25 off-ramp intersection is expected to
operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour. Taking the interactions of the closely-spaced
intersections into consideration, the average queue on the southbound exit ramp is expected
to reach 900 feet and the maximum queue would extend into the I-25 mainline lanes during
the AM peak hour, creating a potentially dangerous situation for freeway and ramp traffic.
The I-25 freeway also degrades significantly from LOS C and LOS D under existing conditions
to LOS F in 2030 between the Orchard Road and Dry Creek Road interchanges during peak hours
in the peak direction (northbound during the morning peak hour and southbound during the
evening peak hour). This high level of freeway congestion would result in failing ramp
merge/diverge operations at the Arapahoe Road interchange. With these operational failures
on the freeway, the queues from the ramp metering would back up to Arapahoe Road and
impact the traffic traveling through the interchange area with only two lanes provided through
the interchange ramp intersections.

5.     Evaluation of Alternatives
In 2005, Arapahoe County, CDOT, Greenwood Village, and Centennial sponsored the Arapahoe
Road Corridor Study, which included the evaluation of initial configuration options for the
Arapahoe/I-25 interchange. The corridor study included an extensive task force and public
meeting process. The study Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and Executive Committee (EC)
were comprised of engineers, planners, and stakeholder agency representatives that reviewed
and guided the study process. The corridor study evaluation effort led to the selection of the
interchange alternatives examined in this System Level Feasibility Study report.

5.1. Preliminary Interchange Options
The Arapahoe Road Corridor Study considered a range of options for improvements to the
Arapahoe/I-25 interchange. The initial options considered, shown in Figure 13, include
improvements to the existing cloverleaf type interchange, concepts with improved ramp
intersection operations, and three level interchange concepts.
Alternative A - Improved Partial Cloverleaf: Conceptual design options were considered for
improving the existing partial cloverleaf interchange design geometry. The concept includes
increasing the loop ramp radius for the loop within the NW quadrant. The partial cloverleaf
interchange would also include additional east/west travel lanes on Arapahoe Road for a total
of six lanes traveling through the interchange.
Alternative B - Single Point Urban: The single point urban interchange option would replace
the existing partial cloverleaf interchange and its two signalized ramp intersections with a
single three-phase signalized intersection on Arapahoe Road. Due to the substantial width of
the intersection, a long, deep clear span structure is required, and relatively long clearance
intervals are required at the ramps signalized intersection. The tight ramp configuration would
result in excess right-of-way from the current two cloverleaf ramps.
Alternative C - Tight Urban Diamond: The tight urban diamond interchange configuration
includes two closely-spaced signalized intersections to serve ramp terminal and Arapahoe Road
traffic movements. Due to the proximity of the signalized ramp intersections, signal
operations of the two intersections would be operated as one signal with four-phase overlap
phasing. Much of the Arapahoe Road left turn storage may be provided outside the signalized
intersections, with signal timing developed to minimize the number of vehicles stored between
the ramp intersections. This alternative also includes additional east/west travel lanes on
Arapahoe Road for a total of six lanes traveling through the interchange.
Alternative D - Directional Ramps: This option consists of directional ramps to/from north I-
25 with diamond configuration ramps to/from south I-25. This alternative includes additional
east/west travel lanes on Arapahoe Road for a total of six lanes traveling through the
interchange. This interchange option would have significant impacts to I-25 lane alignments
due to the widening that would be required for shoulder areas for the grade change-related
barriers of the flyover/tunnel ramps. (I-25 widening would be all to the east due to the
proximity of the light rail bridge to the west.) Tunneling for a curved ramp underpass would
be complicated and require storm drainage accommodations. A short weave area would result

                                                                    System Level Feasibility Study
Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                         June 2008

for southbound I-25 to eastbound Arapahoe Road traffic prior to the Boston Street/Clinton
Street intersection.
Alternative E - Tunnel: With this option, the eastbound to northbound and westbound to
southbound ramp movements would be accommodated as tunnels under the interchange. All
eastbound and westbound traffic bound for I-25 would be separated from Arapahoe Road west
of Yosemite Street and east of Boston Street/Clinton Street, respectively, with local access to
the southwest and northeast quadrants crossing over the on ramps. The existing four through
lanes on Arapahoe Road would remain without additional widening through the interchange.
Similar to the directional ramp option, the merge of the westbound to southbound ramp would
require additional shoulder area along the southbound on ramp, consequently requiring a shift
in the alignment of I-25. The curved tunnel ramps would require complicated construction and
drainage accommodations.
Alternative F - Diverging Diamond: A diverging diamond interchange is a form of diamond
interchange in which the two directions of traffic on the intersecting arterial roadway cross to
the opposite side on both sides of the bridge at the freeway. Simple two-phase traffic signal
control of the ramp intersections could improve overall interchange and corridor traffic
operations. However, driver expectancy issues may increase the number of crashes within the
interchange area. The speed limit on Arapahoe Road would also need to be substantially
reduced through the interchange to be consistent with the low design speed of the curving
intersection approaches. This alternative includes additional east/west travel lanes on
Arapahoe Road for a total of six lanes traveling through the interchange.
Alternative G - Three Level Diamond: The three level diamond option would include an
underpass for east/west Arapahoe Road through traffic under the existing level of Arapahoe
Road. The underpass would provide two lanes in each direction for through travel on Arapahoe
Road. Ramp intersection movements would occur on the existing level of Arapahoe Road, and
I-25 would remain the top level of the interchange. Turn accommodations for ramp traffic
bound for the adjacent Yosemite Street and Boston Street/Clinton Street would be made to
eliminate weaving traffic movements along Arapahoe Road. The underpass would require
complicated construction and drainage accommodations.
Alternative H - Yosemite to Costilla Connection: With this option, the existing interchange
configuration and number of lanes remain, but a new underpass of I-25 south of Arapahoe
Road would be constructed to connect Yosemite Street and Costilla Avenue. This would
provide an alternate route for east/west through traffic to bypass the interchange area along
Arapahoe Road. The new five-lane section of Costilla Avenue would begin at a T-intersection
with Yosemite Street west of I-25, cross under the freeway south of the Target property, and
connect at the existing Costilla Avenue and Clinton Street intersection. The existing section of
Costilla Avenue east of Clinton Street would also be improved to meet the existing five-lane
section at Fulton Street.

5.1.1. Preliminary Evaluation
The seven initial alternatives were evaluated against a wide range of applicable evaluation
criteria. These criteria were categorized as:
       Traffic Operations/Level of Service (LOS)
       Safety/Crash Potential
       Access to Adjacent Land Uses
       Constructability/Phasing
       Right-of-Way Requirements
       Existing Business Impacts
       Construction/Implementation Cost
Table 7 provides a summary of the evaluation of preliminary alternatives. This evaluation
matrix provides a comparative analysis of the alternatives related to the evaluation criteria.

 5.1.2. Traffic Operations/Level of Service
These criteria consider the number of traffic signals within the interchange area (including the
signalized intersections at Yosemite Street and Boston Street) and the direct connection for
heavy turning movements to/from I-25. It also considers weaving movements or complex
operations required to accommodate local movements within the interchange area. The
evaluation indicates that the Improved Partial Cloverleaf (Alternative A) and Yosemite and
Costilla Connection (Alternative H) would best comply with the project goals related to this
criteria. The Single Point Urban interchange would remove a signal from Arapahoe, but limits
the capacity of the movements accessing I-25. The Tight Urban Diamond interchange would
continue to require Arapahoe Road traffic to travel through four closely-spaced signalized
intersections and would limit the capacity of the left turns accessing I-25. The Directional
Ramps, Tunnel, Diverging Diamond, and Three Level Diamond alternatives would provide high
capacity for certain movements through the interchange, but all would create complicated
weaving movements and/or unusual maneuvers that would degrade overall interchange
operations.

 5.1.3. Safety/Crash Potential
The number of conflict points in the interchange area, potential queuing and weaving conflicts
along Arapahoe Road and interstate ramps, and driver expectancy are considered in this
evaluation. The Single Point Urban (Alternative B) alternative indicates the best compliance
with project safety goals due to one less intersection on Arapahoe Road. The Improved Partial
Cloverleaf (Alternative A) also has moderate compliance with the safety goals since increased
capacity would reduce the number of congestion-related crashes. The Tight Urban Diamond
(Alternative C) would introduce increased left turn conflicts and queuing at the two ramp
intersections since left turns would occur at the ramp intersections and the queues would need
to be stored on the approaches to the interchange, outside the area between the ramp
intersections. Although the Yosemite and Costilla Connection would reduce volumes through

the interchange, the additional intersection on Yosemite introduces additional conflict points.
The Directional Ramps, Tunnel, Diverging Diamond and Three Level Diamond alternatives have
driver expectancy safety concerns due to the unusual configurations and short distances for
lane changes and turning movements between the four interchange area intersections.

 5.1.4. Access to Adjacent Land Uses
Access limitations and restrictions resulting from the interchange configuration are considered
in this evaluation. Each of the interchange configuration alternatives will impact access to
adjacent development areas to some degree.            The Yosemite and Costilla Connection
(Alternative H) would provide additional access opportunities across I-25 south of the
interchange. The Improved Partial Cloverleaf (Alternative A) and Tunnel (Alternative E)
configurations provide the potential for signalized access to the southwest quadrant across
from the Southbound I-25 off-ramp.

5.1.5. Constructability/Phasing
This criterion considers the accommodation of traffic through the interchange during
construction. Each of the interchange configuration alternatives would have some detour and
construction impacts to traffic traveling through the area. The Yosemite and Costilla
Connection (Alternative H) would have no impact to traffic through the interchange. The
greatest impacts would result from alternatives that would be difficult to build in phases
and/or would require the realignment of I-25, including the Single Point Urban (Alternative
B), Directional Ramps (Alternative D), Tunnel (Alternative E), and Three Level Diamond
(Alternative G) alternatives.

 5.1.6. Right-of-Way Requirements
Impacts are based on the number of parcels affected. The most right-of-way within the
interchange area would be required with the Directional Ramps and Tunnel alternatives and the
least amount of right-of-way is required with the Single Point Urban (Alternative B)
configuration. The Yosemite and Costilla Connection (Alternative H) would require substantial
right-of-way along the new roadway alignment. The Improved Partial Cloverleaf, Tight Urban
Diamond, and Diverging Diamond alternatives would require minimal, if any, additional right-
of-way outside of the existing interchange footprint.

5.1.7. Existing Business Impacts
Impact to existing businesses within the study area is considered the key differentiating
environmental characteristic for this level of screening. Other, more specific, environmental
criteria are considered in the next level of alternative assessment.
Impacts are based on the number of existing businesses displaced. No impacts to existing
buildings are anticipated with the Improved Partial Cloverleaf (Alternative A), Single Point
Urban (Alternative B), Tight Urban Diamond (Alternative C), and Diverging Diamond
(Alternative F) configurations. The Yosemite and Costilla Connection (Alternative H) would
require major impacts to at least two buildings south of the interchange area.

 5.1.8. Construction/Implementation Cost
An initial estimate of the range of construction costs was developed. More detailed cost
estimates are provided for the detailed alternatives later in this report. The initial estimates
indicate that the Directional Ramps, Tunnel, and Three Level Diamond alternatives would be
the most expensive. The Improved Partial Cloverleaf (Alternative A), Tight Urban Diamond
(Alternative C), Diverging Diamond (Alternative F), and Yosemite and Costilla Connection
(Alternative H) alternatives would be the least expensive interchange configurations.

5.2. Preliminary Screening Summary

5.2.1. Alternatives Screened Out
Based on the results of the preliminary alternatives evaluation, the following alternatives are
not forwarded for further detailed evaluation. Primary reasons that these alternatives have
been screened from further consideration are highlighted below.
       Alternative C ­ Tight Urban Diamond: The diamond interchange ramp intersections
       with Arapahoe Road would not provide sufficient capacity to accommodate future
       traffic volumes. The eastbound to northbound and westbound to southbound left turn
       movements would exceed the capacity of double left turn lanes and queues would
       extend through the interchange. Limited storage length would be provided between
       the two ramp intersections. Traffic signal progression along Arapahoe Road would be
       compromised with the additional left turn phases at the ramp signals. Due to the
       nature of the construction within existing travel areas, there would be some difficulty
       with building the interchange ramps and intersections in phases.
       Alternative D ­ Directional Ramps: The locations of the eastbound to northbound
       and southbound to eastbound ramp merges/diverges along Arapahoe Road would result
       in complex weaving maneuvers that would be difficult to sign with traffic interactions
       at the Boston/Clinton and Yosemite Street intersections. The northbound to westbound
       and westbound to southbound left turns would require the ramp terminals to remain
       signalized. The westbound to southbound left turn movement would exceed the
       capacity of double left turn lanes and queues would extend through the northbound
       ramp intersection. All traffic headed for Southbound I-25 would travel on one diamond
       ramp, rather than the diamond ramp and loop ramp with the existing type of
       configuration, which results in decreased storage length for queues from the ramp
       meter or the I-25 merge.
       The flyover and tunnel ramps would require complicated construction and realignment
       of the freeway. Due to the nature of the construction within existing travel lanes, it
       would be difficult to build in phases. New right-of-way would be required in all four
       quadrants of the interchange with potential business building impacts in the
       southwest, northeast, and southeast quadrants.
       Alternative E - Tunnel: The locations of the I-25 entrance ramp diverges along
       eastbound and westbound Arapahoe Road would result in complex lane changing
       maneuvers east and west of the Boston/Clinton and Yosemite Street intersections. The

Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                         June 2008

       I-25 exit ramp terminals would remain signalized. The tunnels under Arapahoe Road
       would require complicated construction. New right-of-way would be required in the
       southwest and northeast quadrants of the interchange for the approaches to the
       tunnels with the potential for business building impacts.
       Alternative F ­ Diverging Diamond: The unconventional layout with realigned lanes
       for drivers to travel on the left side of the roadway creates critical safety concerns
       related to driver expectancy. The unusual weaving operations surrounding the ramp
       terminal intersections are inconsistent with a long-term solution for the relatively high
       non-peak speeds of Arapahoe Road. All traffic headed for Northbound or Southbound I-
       25 would travel on single diamond ramps, rather than the diamond ramps and loop
       ramps with the existing type of configuration, which results in decreased storage
       length for queues from the ramp meters or the I-25 merge. Due to the nature of the
       construction within existing travel lanes, it would be difficult to build in phases.
       Alternative G ­ Three Level Diamond: The decision point between Arapahoe Road
       through movements and freeway ramp access movements would be difficult to sign with
       the short distance and traffic interactions at the Boston/Clinton and Yosemite Street
       intersections. Providing local access within the interchange area would be complicated
       with the grade-separation of Arapahoe Road movements. All traffic headed for
       Northbound or Southbound I-25 would travel on single diamond ramps, rather than the
       diamond ramps and loop ramps with the existing type of configuration, which results in
       decreased storage length for queues from the ramp meters or the I-25 merge. New
       right-of-way would be required along Arapahoe Road. The tunnels under Arapahoe
       Road would require complicated construction and the nature of the construction within
       existing travel lanes would make it difficult to build in phases.
       Alternative H ­ Yosemite and Costilla Connection: The travel modeling indicates
       that the alternate route between Yosemite Street and Clinton Street along Costilla
       Avenue would decrease traffic traveling along Arapahoe Road through the interchange
       by 3,000 vehicles per day with most volume reduction expected during the peak hours.
       Although a benefit to traffic operations at the ramp terminal intersections, the travel
       forecasts show that the connection would not divert sufficient traffic to eliminate the
       need for additional capacity improvements within the immediate interchange area. The
       connection would be best combined with another build alternative to provide the
       reduction of traffic volumes through the interchange as well as a potential alternate
       route during the interchange reconstruction.

5.2.2. Alternatives for Further Consideration
Based on the results of the preliminary alternatives evaluation, the Improved Partial Cloverleaf
(Alternative A) and Single Point Urban (Alternative B) alternatives are forwarded for more
detailed evaluation. The Improved Partial Cloverleaf and Single Point Urban interchange
configurations provide the best traffic operations and safety benefits and perform better than
the other alternatives in almost all of the preliminary evaluation criteria.
Due to the additional capacity, access, and construction phasing benefits identified for the
Yosemite and Costilla Connection in the preliminary evaluation, both alternatives moving

forward into the detailed alternative assessment were modified to include a new underpass of
I-25 south of Arapahoe Road connecting Yosemite Street and Costilla Avenue as a means for
east/west through traffic to bypass the interchange area. Table 8 illustrates the comparison
of the preliminary alternatives with the evaluation of the modified alternatives, Improved
Partial Cloverleaf with Costilla Connection (Modified Alternative A) and Single Point Urban
Interchange with Costilla Connection (Modified Alternative B), related to the preliminary
evaluation criteria.
The modification to add the Costilla Connection makes the two alternatives even more superior
to the other configurations considered in the preliminary evaluation. The reduction in traffic
volumes through the interchange resulting from the underpass increases the traffic operations
and safety benefits of the improvements. The new roadway connection would provide
additional access opportunities across I-25 south of the interchange. The construction of the
Costilla Connection would not impact traffic through the interchange. However, phasing the
construction of the underpass first would provide a valuable alternate route for traffic during
the interchange reconstruction of either the Improved Partial Cloverleaf or Single Point Urban
configurations.
Adding the Costilla Connection to the alternatives does add substantial right-of-way, existing
business impacts, and costs since it is a new roadway alignment through a developed area.
However, the Improved Partial Cloverleaf and Single Point Urban interchange configurations
required minimal, if any, right-of-way and existing business impacts, so the modified
alternatives still perform better overall than the larger-scale alternatives (Directional Ramps,
Tunnel, and Three Level Diamond). The traffic operations, safety, access, and construction
phasing benefits of the modified alternatives outweigh the additional right-of-way impacts and
construction costs.
The Costilla underpass connection is also an element of the recommended alternative in the
Arapahoe Road Corridor Study.

6.      Detailed Alternative Assessment
Based on the preliminary screening of alternatives, the following alternatives are forwarded for
more detailed evaluation.
        Modified Alternative A - Improved Partial Cloverleaf with Costilla Connection
        Modified Alternative B - Single Point Urban Interchange with Costilla Connection

6.1. Evaluation Criteria
Criteria were defined in the following areas for evaluation of the detailed interchange
alternatives:
        Traffic Operations and Safety Performance ­Intersection Levels of Service (LOS), delay,
        and potential queue lengths for critical movements were quantified for each
        alternative. Crash potential as a result of conflict points and queuing was also
        considered.
        Design and Construction ­ Geometric considerations, constructability issues, and
        potential construction phasing were considered in this evaluation.
        Environmental Issues ­ These criteria considered community/business impacts,
        hazardous materials impacts, water resources, noise impacts, as well as air quality
        impacts.
        Right-of-Way Requirements ­ Quantification of the required acres of right-of-way for
        each alternative was calculated.
        Construction Costs ­ Costs for construction, contingencies, construction engineering,
        and construction management are included in this analysis. This analysis excluded the
        cost for right-of-way acquisition.

6.2. Traffic Operations and Safety Performance
Traffic operations were analyzed for the No Build and two interchange alternatives based on
travel forecasts developed for each configuration. Figures 14 and 15 show the peak hour
traffic forecasts for the two build alternatives.
These traffic volumes were developed from the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study traffic forecasts
and are based on the DRCOG 2030 model with the addition of the recommended alternative for
the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study, which includes the Costilla Avenue connection and
improvements to Arapahoe Road, Broncos Parkway, and Easter Avenue, as well as the parallel
routes adjacent to Arapahoe Road (Peakview Avenue and Briarwood Avenue).
Relative to the No Build projections, the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange and Arapahoe Road
corridor improvements show an additional 2,000 vehicles per day on I-25 north of Arapahoe
Road and a decrease of approximately 5,000 vehicles per day on I-25 south of Arapahoe Road.
These changes will have little impact on the future congested operations along I-25.

    As noted with the preliminary alternatives screening, traffic volumes generally decreased on
    Arapahoe Road through the interchange with the addition of the Costilla Avenue connection.
    Traffic volumes on Arapahoe Road decreased almost five percent during the peak hours
    between Yosemite Street and Boston Street/Clinton Street. Daily volume projections on
    Yosemite Street were also reduced slightly, although the turning movements to the south leg
    of the Arapahoe Road and Yosemite Street intersection increased during the peak hours with
    traffic utilizing the Costilla Avenue connection.
    Three key operational parameters distinguish the detailed alternatives: intersection level of
    services, queue lengths on the freeway ramps and between intersections along Arapahoe Road,
    and crash potential due to number of conflict points and queuing. The respective measures
    used to demonstrate the performance level for each parameter are the level of service for each
    of the intersections along Arapahoe Road, the 95th-percentile queue lengths for the
    approaches at the ramp terminal intersections, and crash potential measured by the number of
    conflict points at the ramp terminal intersections and locations of long queues. This
    information is summarized in Table 9. Capacity analysis output is included in Appendix D.

No Build:
With the increase in traffic volumes expected by 2030, the No Build scenario results in a
substantial increase in delay within the interchange area, resulting in more queuing of ramp
traffic onto I-25. The No Build operational analysis is described in Section 4.5 of this report.
Three of the four interchange area intersections operates at LOS F during the AM and/or PM
peak hour. The queues from the entrance ramps to I-25 and through the intersections along
Arapahoe Road cause gridlock through the interchange, creating the potential for increased
safety problems related to congestion along both Arapahoe Road and I-25. The average queue
on the southbound exit ramp is expected to reach 900 feet and the maximum queue would
regularly extend into the I-25 mainline lanes during the AM peak hour.
Modified Alt. A ­ Improved Partial Cloverleaf Interchange with Costilla Connection:
With this alternative, traffic operations along Arapahoe Road improve from LOS F to LOS D at
most intersections along Arapahoe Road during the AM and PM peak hours, due to the
additional arterial lanes through the interchange. The Arapahoe Road and Boston/Clinton
Street intersection operates at LOS E during the AM peak hour and the overall intersection
delay is reduced by almost 65 percent from the No Build alternative. Average delay at the
Yosemite Street intersection is reduced over 30 percent during the PM peak hour.
Although the Southbound I-25 off ramp essentially remains in the current configuration due to
the LRT bridge constraints, the additional southbound left turn lane (for a total of three left
turn lanes) and the five-lane cross-section on Arapahoe Road improves the conditions for
turning traffic from the ramp. Queues on the Southbound I-25 off-ramp are reduced to an
average queue of 425 feet and a maximum queue of 450 feet during the AM peak hour.
Each ramp signal contains five conflict points, which is less than a typical T-intersection since
the left turn movements are accommodated with the loop ramps and do not have to cross
opposing traffic. The number of conflict points within the interchange area is the same as the
No Build scenario.
During the PM peak hour, the queues for traffic entering I-25 extend to Arapahoe Road due to
the ramp metering and congestion on I-25. However, because of the loop ramp layout, the
ramp back ups are limited to the outside lane along Arapahoe Road and, due to the additional
lane through the interchange, through traffic on Arapahoe Road is not blocked. Therefore, the
degradation of freeway merging operations has limited impact on traffic traveling on Arapahoe
Road through the interchange.
Modified Alt. B - Single Point Urban Interchange with Costilla Connection:
With this alternative, a signalized intersection is eliminated along Arapahoe Road, which
increases intersection spacing. Intersection operations are LOS D or better during the AM and
PM peak hours, except at Yosemite Street, which operates at LOS E during the PM peak hour,
and at Boston/Clinton Street, which operates at LOS E during the AM peak hour. The overall
intersection delay at Boston/Clinton Street is reduced by almost 70 percent during the AM
peak hour from the No Build alternative. Average delay at the Yosemite Street intersection is
reduced almost 35 percent during the PM peak hour.
Queues on the Southbound I-25 off-ramp approaching Arapahoe Road are reduced to an
average of 625 feet and a maximum queue of 800 feet during the AM peak hour. A longer
cycle length may be required to clear movements through the ramps signal due to the size of

                                               53
                                                                    System Level Feasibility Study
Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                         June 2008

the intersection. This longer cycle length may create longer queuing along the off-ramps and
Arapahoe Road, as well as complicate signal progression with the Yosemite Street and
Boston/Clinton Street intersections.
Although both ramps are accommodated at one signalized intersection on Arapahoe Road, the
higher number of turning movements (including the left turns for the entrance ramps) results
in more overall conflict points within the interchange area than the No Build or Improved
Partial Cloverleaf with Costilla Connection alternatives. This increases the potential for
collisions of two (or more) vehicles.
With this configuration, all traffic headed for I-25 would travel on one diamond ramp, rather
than the diamond ramp and loop ramp with the existing type of configuration, which results in
decreased storage length for queues from the ramp meters or the I-25 merges. Because of the
ramp metering and congestion on I-25 expected during the AM and PM peak hour, the queues
on the I-25 entrance ramps extend through the Arapahoe Road signal. Traffic attempting to
turn left onto the freeway ramps backs up into the inside through lanes on Arapahoe Road
while traffic attempting to turn right onto the ramps backs up into the outside lanes.
Therefore, I-25 congestion and ramp metering creates virtual gridlock within the interchange
area. Without ramp metering, entrance ramp queues are reduced and the related congestion is
avoided. If future traffic volumes cause these types of operational issues with ramp metering,
the metering may be limited in use or removed. However, for many years prior to that traffic
volume condition, the ramp metering would improve highway operations and safety.
Therefore, the management of the ramp metering system at this location would be critical for
the operation of this interchange alternative.

6.3. Design and Construction
Conceptual designs were developed for the two build interchange alternatives. Each of the
alternatives was designed within the constraints of the existing light rail bridge piers.
Modified Alt. A ­ Improved Partial Cloverleaf Interchange with Costilla Connection:
This alternative requires reconstruction of the I-25 bridge over Arapahoe Road to accommodate
three through lanes on Arapahoe Road, which will result in construction-related impacts to I-
25 and Arapahoe Road traffic. Horizontally this interchange layout is identical to the existing
interchange with the majority of the work being done to accommodate the widening along
Arapahoe Road, a deeper structure depth, and consequently profile grade line changes to both
Arapahoe Road and mainline I-25.
The existing interchange was constructed under the T-REX project with variances to limit
reconstruction and right-of-way acquisitions. At least two of the six ramps were constructed
with variances. The Southbound I-25 loop ramp was constructed with less than a 25-mph
minimum radius and the Southbound I-25 entrance ramp was constructed with less than a 50-
mph vertical design speed at the gore with mainline I-25. The location of the LRT alignment
west of the freeway also reduced the ramp meter lane drop taper from the T-REX project
standard of 50:1 to 30:1 at this same location.
Similar issues are created with the design for this alternative, such as reduced design speed at
the ramp terminals with Arapahoe Road, reduced horizontal design speed of the Southbound I-
25 loop ramp, and the need to raise the grade for Northbound and Southbound I-25 above four

                                              54
                                                                        System Level Feasibility Study
Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                             June 2008

percent for a short distance to accommodate increased structure depths and changes to the
Arapahoe Road profile grade line.
The following summarizes design considerations and concerns for this alternative based on the
conceptual design (less than ten percent design effort):
       Design will require over 2,000 feet of reconstruction of I-25;
       Design will require design variances for the horizontal design of the loop ramps (less
       than 25-mph) and vertical design of I-25 (greater than four percent vertical grade);
       Arapahoe Road will need to be raised approximately three feet to accommodate the
       ramp profiles; and
       Conceptual design is based on an assumed structure depth of five feet and two inches.
The cloverleaf loop ramps in the northwest and southeast quadrants will allow for detention of
storm drainage flows within the interchange, simplifying the conveyance of stormwater runoff
through the project area. Assuming that two to six feet of depth could be accommodated
within the loop ramp areas, a total of 16 acre-feet of detention could be recognized. For an
interchange of this configuration and size, 15-20 acre-feet is a feasible range for detention
(10-year discharge). In addition to the detention, however, an additional one to five acre-feet
of water quality storage is probable for the anticipated contributing runoff area for the
interchange. Some or all of this additional area may be accommodated in linear ditches
adjacent to mainline I-25 or provided by mechanical treatment systems.
Modified Alt. B - Single Point Urban Interchange with Costilla Connection:
This alternative requires a long, single span bridge structure to accommodate the left turns to
and from the ramps at the Arapahoe Road intersection, which would require exceptionally deep
structural girders. This bridge design will require lowering Arapahoe Road and raising I-25 to
provide adequate vertical clearance, which would result in more complex construction phasing
and substantial impacts to I-25 and Arapahoe Road traffic during construction. Lowering
Arapahoe Road creates particularly severe phasing issues at existing intersections and access
points. Temporary roadways and multiple stages of traffic detours would be required to
maintain traffic on both Arapahoe Road and I-25 during bridge construction. Construction of
the west side ramps would need to avoid impacts to the existing light rail bridge, which would
require creative design solutions. This is particularly critical adjacent to the LRT retaining
walls and ballast walls west of I-25.
The following summarizes design considerations and concerns for this alternative based on the
conceptual design (less than ten percent design effort):
       Design will require over 4,000 feet of reconstruction of I-25;
       Horizontal or vertical design may require variances; and
       Conceptual design is based on an assumed structure depth of eight feet and four
       inches.
Like the Improved Partial Cloverleaf with Costilla Connection alternative, available area for
detention and water quality storage volume will primarily be handled within or immediately
adjacent to the interchange improvements. The primary storage area will be in the southeast

Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                         June 2008

quadrant of the interchange where the existing northbound exit ramp and entrance loop ramp
will be removed. This area equates to approximately the same volume as the Improved Partial
Cloverleaf with Costilla Connection alternative and will provide adequate storage for detention,
but may need additional water quality volume in the form of linear ditches and mechanical
cleansers.

6.4. Environmental Issues
The impacts to the human and natural environments with the study area that would result from
implementation of each of the final alternatives were evaluated. This evaluation was based on
the information provided with the project environmental overview, described in Chapter 3 of
this report.
No Build:
The No Build condition would have some negative impact to air quality within the study area
due to increasing congestion. No other new environmental impacts are applicable if the
project is not constructed.
Modified Alt. A ­ Improved Partial Cloverleaf Interchange with Costilla Connection:
This interchange alternative would close the right-in/right-out access to the northwest
quadrant, located on the north side of Arapahoe Road between the Southbound I-25 ramp and
Yosemite Street intersections. Access to the properties would continue to be provided off
Yosemite Street. The Costilla Connection south of Arapahoe Road would require major impacts
to at least two buildings, an office building west of I-25 and a hotel east of I-25. More
specific parking and construction impacts may be assessed during the project environmental
documentation.
This interchange alternative would have minor impacts to wetlands within the project area,
potentially only in the southeast quadrant of the interchange in the area of construction for
the Costilla Avenue connection.
The interchange project would have a minor, yet positive, impact on the air quality of the
Southeastern Denver Metropolitan region based on the anticipated decreases in intersection
delay and congestion along Arapahoe Road. During the subsequent NEPA process for this
project a carbon monoxide hot spot analysis will be conducted, as required.
Recognized environmental conditions related to hazardous materials include potential impacts
related to automotive service stations, storage units, and commercial facilities in the
southwest quadrant of the interchange, east of the interchange along Arapahoe Road, and
along Costilla Avenue east of I-25. Further evaluation of the potential hazardous material
sites may be warranted prior to final design of the project. During the subsequent NEPA
process for this project a Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of hazardous materials
will be conducted.
Modified Alt. B - Single Point Urban Interchange with Costilla Connection:
This alternative would close the right-in/right-out access to the northwest quadrant and the
signalized access to the northeast quadrant of the interchange. Access to the properties in
the northwest quadrant would continue to be provided off Yosemite Street and property access
for the northeast quadrant would continue to be provided off Boston Street. Similar to the

Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                          June 2008

Improved Partial Cloverleaf with Costilla Connection alternative, the Costilla Connection south
of Arapahoe Road would require major impacts to at least two buildings, an office building
west of I-25 and a hotel east of I-25. More specific parking and construction impacts may be
assessed during the project environmental documentation.
This interchange alternative would have similar impacts to wetlands, air quality, and hazardous
materials resources as the Improved Partial Cloverleaf with Costilla Connection alternative.

6.5. Right-of-Way Requirements
The acres of right-of-way required for each build alternative shown below were calculated
based on the conceptual design layout of the interchange. The right-of-way for both of the
alternatives includes approximately 5.0 acres for the Yosemite to Costilla Connection.
       Improved Partial Cloverleaf with Costilla Connection (Mod. Alt. A): approx. 6.1 acres
       Single Point Urban with Costilla Connection (Mod. Alt. B): approx. 6.8 acres
The larger area of right-of-way needed for the Single Point Urban with Costilla Connection
alternative is mostly within the northeast quadrant of the interchange, where the Northbound
I-25 entrance ramp curves around and encroaches upon the existing access road and parking
areas. With the Improved Partial Cloverleaf with Costilla Connection alternative, this area is
not impacted.
These right-of-way estimates do not include total takes of parcels, which may be required for
either alternative depending on the final details of access location, parking impacts, and right-
of-way negotiations. Both interchange alternatives may also require additional business
relocations depending on the final Arapahoe Road alignment. Two commercial buildings (an
office and a hotel) would be directly impacted by the Costilla/Yosemite connection.

6.6. Construction Costs
The ranges of construction costs shown below were identified for the two build alternatives
based on an initial opinion of probable construction cost, including contingencies,
construction engineering, and construction management. The figures for both of the
alternatives include $35-45 million for the Yosemite to Costilla Connection. These cost
estimates shown were developed in September 2006 and are the cost data provided to DRCOG
for development of the Draft 2035 Plan to identify Federal funding for the interchange
improvements. These initial estimates do not include right-of-way (see Section 6.5 for right-
of-way area requirements).
       Improved Partial Cloverleaf with Costilla Connection (Mod. Alt. A): $85 - 105 million
       Single Point Urban with Costilla Connection (Mod. Alt. B): $105 ­ 125 million

6.7. Summary of Alternatives Evaluation
A summary matrix of the detailed alternatives evaluation is provided in Table 10. The final
screening identified concerns associated with the Single Point Urban with Costilla Connection
alternative related to the potential for gridlock congestion and queuing on Arapahoe Road

Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange                                                        June 2008

from the ramp metering system and future congestion along the I-25 mainline. There are
much larger construction impacts for I-25 related to the long, single span bridge structure as
well as concerns with compromising the existing light rail infrastructure in the southwest
quadrant of the interchange. The Single Point Urban configuration also requires the closure of
the signalized access to the northeast quadrant of the interchange.
The No Build alternative would not provide the capacity necessary to meet the forecasted
travel demand at the interchange, resulting in increased traffic congestion, safety concerns,
and air quality impacts.
Based on the results of the alternatives evaluation, Modified Alternative 1 - Improved Partial
Cloverleaf with Costilla Connection is recommended for further evaluation in the subsequent
NEPA process for the interchange improvements. This interchange configuration will provide
the necessary transportation facilities and services to adequately accommodate travel demand
through and beyond the 2030 planning horizon with minimal impacts to surrounding
properties. Most improvements within the immediate interchange area would be generally
located within the existing interchange footprint with widening impacts along Arapahoe Road
and construction along I-25 for the bridge reconstruction. The majority of project
environmental and property impacts would be located along the Costilla/Yosemite alignment.
This analysis concludes that the Improved Partial Cloverleaf with Costilla Connection
configuration with improvements along Arapahoe Road will provide the greatest benefit with
limited impacts. However, further design analysis may identify limiting design variances and
more benefits for shifting I-25. Therefore, these types of design details should continue to be
explored during the environmental documentation for the interchange.

7.     Preliminary Recommended Improvements

7.1. Description of Recommended Alternative
Based on the results of the evaluation of alternatives, Modified Alternative A - Improved
Partial Cloverleaf with Costilla connection is recommended. This interchange configuration,
shown in Figure 18, will provide the necessary transportation facilities and services to
adequately accommodate travel demand through and beyond the 2030 planning horizon for
this study. Components of the conceptual design for the interchange, including local access,
major intersection design along Arapahoe Road, and movements to/from I-25, are discussed in
this section of the report. Roadway profiles developed for the conceptual design of the
Recommended Alternative are included in Appendix E.

7.1.1. I-25 Mainline
I-25 will be designed to meet the requirements of the typical section, which includes five
twelve-foot through lanes in each direction, ten-foot inside and outside shoulders, a two-foot
wide concrete median barrier and twelve-foot acceleration/deceleration lanes, where required.
Because the improvements are generally located within the existing interchange footprint, the
existing interchange ramp merges and diverges along I-25 will remain in the current locations
along I-25 and the existing lane add/drop configurations will not be modified.

7.1.2. I-25 Ramps
The interchange ramps will be designed to accommodate the 2030 traffic volume projections
discussed earlier in this report. The entrance ramps will provide one lane access to I-25,
narrowing from two lanes at the ramp meter locations. The ramps will include a four-foot left
shoulder, a fifteen-foot wide lane, and a minimum six-foot right shoulder. The exit ramps will
consist of two lanes, diverging I-25 as a drop lane and an option lane approaching the ramp
gore.

7.1.3. Arapahoe Road
Arapahoe Road will be designed to meet the requirements of CDOT and local agency standard
specifications. The typical section will match the existing Arapahoe Road section east and
west of the interchange, carrying three twelve-foot lanes through the interchange area.
During the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study agency coordination process, the possibility of
enhanced local access to the southwest quadrant of the interchange via a roadway constructed
directly across from the Southbound I-25 exit ramp was discussed with the local agencies with
the Improved Partial Cloverleaf interchange configuration. The local agencies were told that
the signal operations, allowable movements, and safety concerns for such an access would
need to be studied in detail with traffic projections considering the trip generation of the
potential redevelopment within the southwest quadrant area prior to any access approvals.
The operation of a south leg at the Southbound I-25 ramp intersection would need to consider
interactions with Eastbound Arapahoe Road traffic bound for the I-25 entrance ramps and the
closure of the existing right-in/right-out access into the southwest quadrant east of Yosemite

Street. CDOT currently opposes providing this access across from the Southbound I-25 exit
ramp and the access is not shown with the Recommended Alternative in Figure 17.

7.1.4. Costilla Avenue Connection
Costilla Avenue from Yosemite Street to Fulton Street will be designed to meet the
requirements of the City of Greenwood Village's and Arapahoe County's standard design criteria.
The typical section will include eight to ten-foot attached sidewalks, four eleven-foot through
travel lanes, three-foot buffers for bikes adjacent to the curb and gutter, and an eleven-foot
painted median.
The Yosemite Street/Costilla Avenue intersection, located approximately 300 feet north of the
existing Yosemite Street/Alton Way signal, will be designed providing Yosemite Street with the
major through movements to avoid queuing impacts at the Yosemite Street/Alton Way
intersection. A short length of raised median will be required to accommodate piers for the
structures at I-25. The I-25 structures were assumed with two 42-foot spans and structure
depths of three feet. A reduced minimum design speed of 35 mph will be required to limit
property impacts east of the I-25 underpass.
The north curb line of Costilla Avenue from Clinton Street to Fulton Street will be held through
this section with the majority of the widening impacts occurring to the south.

7.2. Alternate Transportation Modes
Alternate mode accommodations to be implemented with the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange
improvements will be implemented consistent with the recommended improvements of the
Arapahoe Road Corridor Study. These improvements include improved sidewalks along both the
north and south sides of Arapahoe Road from Yosemite Street, through the interchange, to the
Boston/Clinton Street intersection. Sidewalks will also be constructed along both sides of
Costilla Avenue from Yosemite Street to Fulton Street.
Bicycle accommodations will be focused on the new Costilla Avenue crossing of I-25. Bicycle
advocates input during the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study indicated a desire to utilize roadways
parallel to rather than along Arapahoe Road itself. Widened outside travel lanes as described
above will ultimately connect with bicycle improvements along Briarwood Avenue resulting in a
parallel bike route from Yosemite to Jordan Road.
Expanded fixed route local transit services recommended in conjunction with the Arapahoe
Road Corridor Study will utilize the Yosemite to Costilla connection under I-25 to serve
locations south of the interchange, avoiding the interchange itself as existing routes do today
via the Yosemite Street overpass.

7.3. Preliminary Funding Package

7.3.1. Preliminary Cost of Recommended Improvement
The costs for the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange improvements, based on the limited conceptual
design completed to date, are estimated to be:
Construction cost estimate: $53.7 million
Design cost estimate: $8.1 million
Utilities cost estimate: $1.5 million
NEPA Documentation: $1.0 million (funded through current TIP)
Construction Management: $11.3 million
Total: $75.6 million (not including right of way)
All costs are based on 2006 dollars and do not include maintenance or financing costs. An
estimate of probable cost for the recommended improvement is included in Appendix F.
Right of way costs for the project will be comprised of three components: full parcel takes
(including buildings and businesses), partial parcel takes which may diminish the total value
of the property, and partial takes which will not diminish the value of the property. Due to
the complexity of determining property and building values, right of way costs are difficult to
estimate. At this time, the right of way costs are conceptually estimated to be in the range of
$15 to 30 million.

 7.3.2. Proposed Funding Plan
The reconstruction of the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange has long been viewed by the surrounding
local governments and the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) as an integral part
of the Regional Transportation Plan (see Section 1.5). The 2030 RTP was recently updated to
the 2035 plan, which does not include as many projects as contained in the 2030 RTP due to
fiscal constraints. This project was part of the 2030 fiscally constrained plan and is included
in the new 2035 fiscally-constrained RTP. Therefore, the proposed interchange improvements
are eligible for funding in the competitive process of the Transportation Improvement Program
(TIP) for allocation of funds under the metropolitan allocation of the Surface Transportation
Program (STP-Metro). The DRCOG 2035 fiscally-constrained plan includes $83 million for this
project, which is a combination of local and federal/state funding.
Due to the inherent regional benefits of the project, Arapahoe County will continue to pursue
the TIP process for funding a portion of the cost of this project. This feasibility study and
other coordination required to initiate the project are being completed as part of the Arapahoe
Road Corridor Study. Arapahoe County has obtained current TIP funding for the environmental
clearance coordination and documentation for the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange reconstruction
($1 million). The County will pursue additional TIP funding for portions of the design, right of
way acquisition, construction, and construction management efforts. Earmarked funding will
also be pursued after the Arapahoe Road/Parker Road interchange is fully funded.

Maintenance costs and agreements on maintenance issues within the interchange area will be
negotiated between CDOT and the surrounding communities with a separate Intergovernmental
Agreement.

7.4. Project Support
Support for long-term improvements at the Arapahoe/I-25 Interchange has been received from
each of the agencies represented as part of the Arapahoe Road Corridor Study. A letter of
support from CDOT Region 6 Transportation Director Randy Jensen (dated October 25, 2007)
notes that "...CDOT supports evaluating the needs at I-25/Arapahoe Road Interchange as the
next priority project along the Corridor...". The City of Greenwood Village adopted a
Resolution on October 15, 2007 in support of the Corridor Study recommendations, including
the Arapahoe/I-25 interchange improvements.
Formal endorsements and letters of support are also soon expected from the City of Centennial,
the City of Aurora, and Arapahoe County.

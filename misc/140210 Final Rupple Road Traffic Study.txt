Introduction

        JACOBS was hired by the City of Fayetteville to conduct a traffic impact analysis for the
extension of Rupple Road from MLK (Hwy 62) to just south of Persimmon Street. The study
area also included the existing section from Persimmon Street to Wedington Drive. The study
area is shown in Figure 1.




                                      Figure 1. Study Area

Currently Rupple Road in the study area extends south from Wedington Drive to just south of
the Owl Creek Elementary/Middle School. There is a traffic signal at the intersection with
Wedington Drive and a 4-way stop at the Persimmon Street intersection. Rupple Road does not
exist between the school and MLK (Hwy 62). The Master Street Plan (City Plan 2030) designates
Rupple Road as a principal arterial parkway. The typical section for principal arterials obtained
from the Master Street Plan is shown in Figure 2. For the study, parking was not included in the
analysis.




                                                                                        2|Page

Study Process:

The step by step study process that we have used in this study is:

   1. Collected the existing information in and around the study area.
   2. The turning movement counts were collected from two (2) intersections(Rupple
      Road/Wedington Drive and Rupple Road/Persimmon Street). Turning movement counts
      were collected on a Tuesday and a Wednesday in October and November, 2013.
   3. Radar counters were used to collect 24 hour counts at strategic points on the road
      network around the campus as shown in Figure 3.
   4. The City of Fayetteville provided the future zoning information for the study area (see
      Table 4).

   5. Jacobs has collected some information from other sources:
           a. Signal timings from City of Fayetteville.
           b. Average Daily Traffic (ADT's) from the Arkansas Highway and Transportation
               Department (AHTD) website.
   6. Development of VISSIM and Synchro base models for the study area.
   7. Development of future traffic numbers based on the historical traffic counts in the area
       as well as future development of the area along the corridor using the future zoning
       information provided by the City.
   8. Analysis and calibration of the existing traffic in the base models.
   9. Analysis of the future alternatives.
   10. Summary of results and findings.

After collecting the data a base traffic model was developedfor the analysis. The modeling
software that is used on this project is VISSIM. VISSIM is microscopic time step driver behavior
traffic simulation software, developed to model urban traffic (vehicle and pedestrian) and
public transit operations. The program analyzes traffic and transit operations under constraints
such as lane configuration, traffic composition, traffic signals, transit stops, etc.,thus making it a
useful tool for the evaluation of various alternatives based on transportation engineering and
planning measures of effectiveness (MOE's) such as vehicle delay, travel times and queue
lengths. This program is capable of implicitly modeling passenger vehicle, light rail transit (LRT)
vehicle and pedestrians simultaneously and also offers great visualization from simple to
complex traffic conditions to provide a realistic picture of the traffic operations.



Level of Service

Level of service (LOS) is a term defined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) to describe the
operating performance of an intersection or roadway. The LOS of an intersection is a qualitative
measure of capacity and operating conditions and is directly related to vehicle delay. LOS
results range from "A" (minimal delay and conflicts) to "F" (significant delays and congestion),
with LOS A representing very short delays and LOS F representing very long delays. As a
practical consideration, LOS D is considered the limit of acceptable operation in an urban
environment. LOS C is the desirable condition. LOS conditions for signalized intersections are
shown in Table 1. For unsignalized intersections, the levels of service are shown in Table 2. The
graphical representation of each intersect on LOS category is displayed in the below Figure 4.




                                                                                           5|Page

Future Traffic

Future traffic was generated for the study area using zoning to estimate future development
densities. Fayetteville Planning provided two densities for residential zoning in the area.

                               Table 4 ­ Future Zoning in Study Area

Fayetteville Planning             Type                            Density

Mountain Ranch                    Typical Suburban                1.95 units per acre
                                  Development

                                  Development Pattern



The future zoning area is approximately 1 mile long by a half mile wide or 320 acres. Which
would provide approximately 1997 units with the higher density or 624 units for the lesser
density. For this study, 1997 units were used.

Analysis

Synchro Analysis
The intersection of Rupple Road and Persimmon Street was evaluated in Synchro using Design
Year-2033 volumes (developed earlier when determining the type of intersection control to be
used at the intersection, not the same traffic volumes used in the VISSIM models) to determine
if the intersection would operate best as a signalized intersection or as a roundabout
intersection based on Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010 methodology.




                                                                                                  11 | P a g e

The following assumptions were made regarding the roundabout analysis:

   ·   North and south approaches reduced to one lane northbound and one lane southbound
   ·   Two-lane roundabout with two exit lanes on the south leg.
   ·   75 feet outer radius
   ·   15 feet roundabout lanes
   ·   18 mph circle speed
   ·   PHF = 0.92
   ·   5% heavy vehicles
   ·   25 mph approach link speed




                                                                              12 | P a g e

The following assumptions were made with regard to the signalized intersection analysis:

   ·   Existing lane configuration at approaches will not change
   ·   Cycle length of 120 seconds
   ·   Permitted left turns
   ·   PHF = 0.92
   ·   5% heavy vehicles

Both scenarios have a low overall intersection delay. Given the negligible difference in overall
delay, it was decided to model the intersection of Rupple Road and Persimmon Street as a
signalized intersection in VISSIM to provide improved safety conditions for pedestrians.

VISSIM Analysis
Three (3) horizon year models were created within VISSIM. These models consisted of an
Existing Year 2013, Opening Year 2013, and Design Year 2033 scenarios.

The Existing Year 2013 model has the existing geometry for Rupple Road including the
intersections of Wedington Drive and Persimmon Street. The Existing Year model was
calibrated using traffic volumes and travel times collected in October and November 2013. The
targets of this calibration effort were obtained from the Traffic Analysis Toolbox Volume III ­
Guidelines for Applying Traffic Microsimulation Modeling Software published by the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and shown in the figure below.




                 Figure 7 ­ FHWA Microsimulation Model Calibration Targets


                                                                                      14 | P a g e
Most of the criteria included in the above figure are self-explanatory, with the possible
exception of GEH Statistic. This measure is a formula used in traffic modeling to compare two
sets of traffic volumes (Observed and Modeled). Its mathematical formulation is similar to the
Chi-Squared test, but it is not a true statistical test but rather an empirical formula. The
formulation for the GEH Statistic is as follows:

                                        2   - 
                                     =  
                                           + 

Where M represents model estimate volume and O represents field counts.

This statistic is typically used to offset the discrepancies that occur when using only simple
percentages, as traffic volumes vary over a wide range. In other words, if using only
percentages, small absolute discrepancies have no impact on large volumes but a large percent
impact in smaller numbers, and vice versa. It has been shown that for traffic volumes smaller
than 10,000 a five percent variation yields smaller numbers than a GEH of five. Beyond 10,000,
five percent differences keep growing linearly whereas GEH=5 follows a decaying curve.

The tables below summarize the calibration results in terms of GEH values and link flows for the
AM peak period model. The results indicate that the model satisfies the volume calibration
criteria listed above.

According to the calibration guidelines, a model is reasonably calibrated when the modeled
travel times are within 15% (or one minute if higher) of the average field collected travel time
for 85% of the cases. Of the field collected travel times provided, only one of the segments fell
within the section of Rupple Road being modeled in the Existing Year model. This segment,
specifically southbound Rupple Road from Wedington Drive to Persimmon Street, had an
average field collected travel time of 83 seconds, this time is used to help calibrate the Existing
Year model. The travel time for this segment within the Existing Year model was also 83
seconds.

The detailed volume and travel time calibration spreadsheets are included in the appendix for
further reference.

For the Design Year 2033 VISSIM analysis the following geometry assumptions were made:

   ·   Rupple Road would curve west shortly after the existing southern terminus before
       traveling directly south to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
   ·   The two proposed roundabouts between Persimmon Street and MLK Boulevard would
       have approximately equal spacing between them. The intersecting east-west roadways
       were assumed to be two-lane undivided facilities.
   ·   As determined based upon the Synchro analysis, the intersection of Rupple Road and
       Persimmon Street would be modeled as a signalized intersection.




                                                                                        16 | P a g e

The following three (3) Build Alternatives were analyzed:

    ·   2-lane Build: Two-lane Rupple Road extension: This alternative provides a 2-lane roadway
        between Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and the existing 4-lane southern termini south of
        Persimmon Street, thereby providing a 2-lane facility between Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
        and Wedington Drive, with the exception of the existing 1,300 foot 4-lane segment south of
        Persimmon Street.
    ·   4-lane Build: This scenario provides a four lane roadway between Martin Luther King Jr.
        Boulevard and the existing 4-lane southern termini south of Persimmon Street. Under this
        scenario, Rupple Road between Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Persimmon Street has a 4-
        lane section that reduces to a 2-lane facility at Persimmon Street.
    ·   4-lane to Wedington Drive Build Alternative: This alternative would provide a 4-lane facility from
        Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to Wedington Drive, eliminating the choke point which occurs
        when the roadway reduces from four lanes to two lanes at Persimmon Street. This alternative
        will require widening between Persimmon Street and Wedington Drive.
        Additional improvements also proposed under this scenario include:
             o Persimmon Street intersection: Modifying the northbound right turn lane into a shared
                 thru-right turn lane
             o Wedington Drive intersection: Modify the northbound approach to include exclusive left
                 turn lane, through lane and exclusive right turn lane with overlap phasing.
             o Wedington Drive intersection: Modify the southbound right turn lane to a shared thru-
                 right turn lane.

The alternatives were evaluated using opening year and design year demand volumes, with the
exception of 4-lane Build to Wedington Drive alternative which was only analyzed for Design Year 2033.
Average vehicle delay at each intersection, corridor travel times, and network-wide performance
measures (i.e., total process volumes, latent demand, total delay time, and average speed) were
extracted from the VISSIM models to assess the performance of each alterative.



Summary of Results and Findings

One of the objectives of this analysis was to determine if and/or when the proposed segment of Rupple
Road, extending from the current terminus south of Persimmon Street to Martin Luther King Jr.
Boulevard, would need to be expanded from a two-lane roadway to a four-lane roadway. After
analyzing the proposed segment of Rupple Road modeled as a two-lane roadway, it was determined
that, although a two-lane facility appears to be operate satisfactorily under opening year demand
conditions, a two-lane facility would not have sufficient capacity to accommodate the design year
demand. Severe congestion was observed throughout the corridor in the Year 2033 2-lane Build
microsimulation model. As shown in Table 12, an acceptable level of delay was observed at all
intersections for both the 2-lane and 4-lane Build alternatives during opening year; whereas, Table 13
shows the intersection delay at several intersections increases considerably as a result of the increase in


                                                                                               18 | P a g e
    traffic volume expected in Year 2033 and lack of intersection capacity under the 2-lane and 4- lane
    alternatives. The results also indicate that delay along the corridor is substantially decreased when
    Rupple Road is widened from two to four lanes between Persimmon Street and Wedington Drive.
    Under the improved 4-lane scenario, intersection delays are less than 25 sec/veh, with the exception of
    the intersection at Wedington Drive which experiences a significant delay on the eastbound approach.

With respect to travel time along the study corridor, the travel time along the two-lane and four-lane
extension of Rupple Road between Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Wedington Drive is relatively
the same in both the northbound and southbound directions in 2013, about 6 minutes; however, in
2033, the travel time is much longer in the northbound direction, about 32 minutes for the 2-lane Build
alternative and 27 minutes for the 4-lane Build alternative. The travel time is improved considerably
when the four-lane section is extended to Wedington Drive, reducing the average northbound travel
time to 6 minutes in 2033.



                                                                                                    22 | P a g e
Likewise, the network wide performance measures show noticeable improvement in Year 2033 when
comparing the 2-lane Build to the 4-lane to Wedington Drive Build. The average speed is almost
doubled, the latent demand is reduced in half, and the total network wide delay is decreased from
approximately 500 seconds to 100 seconds. It should be noted that from a network wide standpoint,
the 4-lane Build alternative does provide a minimal benefit in terms of total delay and average speed
over the 2-lane Build alternative; however, the true benefit of providing a four-lane extension is
diminished by the lane reduction at Persimmon Street which exists in the 4-lane Build alternative.

Based on the operation along the network with expected volumes in the opening year design, the 2-lane
Build and the operation along the network with expected volumes in the design year, the 4-lane to
Wedington Drive Build, the network should operate with acceptable total delay and average speed until
the corridor is developed to approximately 50 to 75% built out. Determining when this level of
development would occur would be difficult to approximate. Given the need for the connection, the
close proximity to the school and I-540, the development could conceivably reach a 50 to 75% build out
in 10 years.

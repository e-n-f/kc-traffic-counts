From: Chris McCrary, Community Development Director
RE:   REZ2013-0007 ­ Supplemental Information
Date: October 25, 2013
______________________________________________________________________________


The application is to propose rezoning the entire parcel to O-I from M-1. Rezoning only the
remnant office building parcel will delay the rezoning case until December. The rezoning case
must accompany an accurate legal description. The survey crew has not completed the physical
work of setting the property pins and shooting the property lines. This step is needed before the
legal description is able to be produced. To avoid delay of the rezoning case, staff would
recommend rezoning the entire parcel and follow up with the subdivision parcel by mid-
November.

The above referenced map illustrates parcel 6-213-073, 250 Pinnacle Way. The City of Norcross
recently purchased this property with the intent to improve, clean and develop the parcel as a
City Park. The parcel contains an existing pond and walking trails including a pedestrian bridge.
Due to years of neglect the property is in a state of decline and blight. The opportunity became
available for the City to purchase the property well below the assessed value. The funding source
for the improvement of the site comes from SPLOST. SPLOST funding is required to be
identified in a specific category. In this specific case, the category of Parks and Recreation must
be adhered to. Based on the strict funding procedures for Parks and Recreation category the
existing office building must be removed from the park improvement project. Therefore, the City
will be required to subdivide the existing office building out of the larger park parcel.

The Pinnacle Point office park is zoned M-1. M-1 zoning holds a minimal size of the lot. The M-
1 minimum size is 1 acre and the intent of the minimal acreage is to support large scale
distribution centers. The remnant office building in the subject parcel will never hold a
distribution component and will only be an office building. The City is proposing to rezone the
subject parcel to O-I (office institutional) in order to minimize the acreage requirement in M-1.
O-I does not have a minimal acreage requirement and the existing office building fits the
proposed zoning category better due to the building's intended use.

Staff recommends that the City rezone parcel 6-213-073 in order to efficiently facilitate the
development of a pedestrian oriented park with SPLOST funding. In order to accomplish the
needed improvements, the City must subdivide the existing parcel to remove the office building.
This approach essentially removes the building from the scope of the Park. A rezoning approval
is necessary from M-1 (Light Industrial) to O-I (Office Institutional) in order to allow the most
land area to be used for the public by removing the minimum acreage M1 requires. Staff
recommends approval of REZ2013-0007 as submitted.

At their regularly scheduled meeting, the Planning and Zoning Board recommended approval of
the City initiated rezoning of the subject parcel.

From: Chris McCrary, Community Development Director
To:   City of Norcross, Mayor and City Council
Date: July 30, 2013
RE: Purchase Policy as it relates to Engineering Services - Parking Structure
______________________________________________________________________________

After discussion of our Purchasing Policy with City Staff, we identified a slight diversion with
the process so far and the purchasing of engineering services for the proposed parking addition at
the community center. Policy requires that if the purchase is between $5K and $10K, the City
does not have to go through the full RFP process, but we are required to obtain three bids for the
scope of services. We have received one bid from Foresite Group. Staff will need to ask our on
call Civil Engineers to submit competitive bids for the same service in order to correctly follow
our purchasing policy.

                                                               STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
1.          Scope, Term, and Termination. 
1.1         Foresite  Group  will  provide  services  to  Client  only  as  specifically  described  in  the  letter  agreement  (the  "Letter  Agreement")  subject  to 
these  Standard  Terms  and  Conditions  (this  "Terms  and  Conditions",  together  with  the  Letter  Agreement  and  incorporated  by  reference  therein, 
this  "Agreement").    The  description  of  work  to  be  performed  by  Foresite  Group  ("Services")  will  be  set  forth  in  a  the  Letter  Agreement.    These 
Terms and Conditions will commence on the effective date of the Letter Agreement and will continue in effect until the earlier of the completion of 
all  Services,  or  termination  of  the  Letter  Agreement.    Except  as  set  forth  in  the  Letter  Agreement,  Foresite  Group  will  provide  its  own  tools, 
materials, equipment and other business items necessary to perform the Services. 
 
1.2.        When  included  in  Foresite  Group's  scope  of  services,  opinions  or  estimates  of  probable  construction  cost  are  prepared  on  the  basis  of 
Foresite  Group's  experience  and  qualifications  and  represent  Foresite  Group's  judgment  as  a  professional  generally  familiar  with  the  industry.  
However, since Foresite Group has no control over the cost of labor, materials, equipment or services furnished by others, contractor's methods of 
determining  prices,  competitive  bidding,  or  market  conditions,  Foresite  Group  does  not  guarantee  that  proposals,  bids,  or  actual  construction  cost 
will not vary from Foresite Group's opinions or estimates of probable construction costs. 
 
1.3.        Termination.    Client  or  Foresite  Group  may  terminate  this  Agreement  for  any  reason  by  giving  the  nonterminating  party  seven  days 
written  notice  prior  to  the  proposed  termination;  provided,  however,  if  payment  is  not  made  by  Client  within  three  (3)  days  of  written  notice  by 
Foresite  Group  to  Client  of  nonpayment,  Foresite  Group  may  terminate  this  Agreement  immediately  for  failure  by  Client  to  make  payments  in 
accordance  with  this  Agreement.    In  the  event  of  termination  by  either  party  for  any  reason,  Client  will  pay  Foresite  Group  for  all  Services 
performed up to the date of termination.  Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11 will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. 
             
2.          Terms  of  Payment.   Except  as  specifically  set  forth  in  the  Letter  Agreement,  the  following  terms  of  payment  will  apply:   Foresite  Group 
will  submit  to  Client  an  itemized  invoice  for  all  of  the  applicable  amount(s)  due  hereunder,  including  without  limitation  any  expenses  incurred  by 
Foresite Group.  Payment will be due 28 days from date of invoice and will be payable only in U.S. dollars. All past due amounts will accrue interest 
at  the  rate  of  1.5%  per  month  or  the  maximum  rate  allowed  by  law,  whichever  is  greater.    Foresite  Group  may,  after  3  days'  written  notice  to 
Client,  suspend  Services  under  this  Agreement,  without  liability;  until  all  past  due  amounts  have  been  paid  in  full,  excluding  nonpayment  for 
amounts  disputed  in  good  faith.   Amounts  invoiced  exclude,  and  Client  will  pay,  all  sales,  use,  transfer,  valueadded  tax  or  other  taxes,  whether 
federal,  state,  provincial,  local,  or  otherwise  which  are  levied  or  imposed  by  reason  of  the  Services  performed,  except  those  based  solely  on 
Foresite  Group's  net  income.    All  payments  shall  be  made  via  EFT  or  sent  to  Foresite  Group,  Inc.,  5185  Peachtree  Pkwy  Ste  240,  Norcross,  GA  
30092. 
 
3.          Ownership.  Each party will retain title to all of its respective Confidential Information as defined in Section 4  below, whether developed 
before,  during,  or  after  the  Services.    Client  agrees  that  any  and  all  deliverables,  plans,  diagrams,  drawings,  specifications  and  documentation 
delivered  to  Client  hereunder  are  instruments  of  professional  service  (the  "Instruments  of  Professional  Service")  which  are  and  shall  remain  the 
property  of  Foresite  Group  whether  the  project  for  which  they  are  made  is  completed  or  not.   Client  shall  be  permitted  to  retain  copies  of  such 
Instruments  of  Professional  Service  for  information  and  reference  only.    The  Instruments  of  Professional  Service  shall  not  be  used  by  Client  on 
other  projects,  or  for  additions  to  the  project  for  which  they  were  made  except  by  agreement  in  writing  and  with  appropriate  compensation  to 
Foresite  Group.   Any  unauthorized  use  of  such  Instruments  of  Professional  Service  shall  be  at  the  Client's  sole  risk  and  without  liability  to  Foresite 
Group. 
 
4.          Confidentiality.   "Confidential  Information"  as  used  in  this  Agreement  will  mean  any  and  all  confidential  and  proprietary  technical  and 
nontechnical  information  including  patent,  copyright,  trade  secret,  and  proprietary  information,  techniques,  models,  inventions,  knowhow, 
processes,  apparatus,  equipment,  algorithms,  software  programs,  and  formulae  related  to  the  current,  future  and  proposed  products  and  services 
of  each  of  the  parties  and/or  its  customers  and/or  vendors,  including,  without  limitation,  information  concerning  product  or  process  research  and 
development,  design  details  and  specifications,  engineering,  financial  data,  manufacturing,  customer  lists,  business  forecasts,  sales  and 
merchandising,  and  marketing  plans.  Each  party  acknowledges  that  in  the  performance  of  any  Services  it  may  be  supplied  with  Confidential 
Information  of  the  other  party.   Each  party  will  treat,  protect,  and  safeguard  as  proprietary  and  confidential  this  Agreement  and  all  Confidential 
Information  disclosed  to  the  other  under  this  Agreement  using  at  least  as  great  a  degree  of  care  as  used  to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of  its  own 
most  Confidential  Information,  but  in  no  event  less  than  a  reasonable  degree  of  care.   Except  with  specific  prior  written  authorization,  each  party 
will  not  use,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  any  of  the  other  party's  Confidential  Information  other  than  for  the  purpose  for  which  it  has  been 
disclosed  in  connection  with  the  performance  of  the  Services.    Each  of  the  parties  agrees  that  it  will  disclose  the  other  party's  Confidential 
Information  only  to  its  employees  who  need  to  know  such  information,  provided  that  such  employees  are  bound  by  terms  and  conditions 
protecting  such  Confidential  Information  substantially  similar  to  those  of  this  Agreement.    Each  party  acknowledges  that  the  disclosure  of  any 
Confidential  Information,  except  as  expressly  permitted  by  this  Agreement,  will  cause  irreparable  injury  for  which  the  injured  party  may  not  have 
an adequate remedy at law.  Accordingly, either party may obtain injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach of any of the foregoing 
undertakings  in  addition  to  any  other  legal  remedies  that  may  be  available,  and  each  party  hereby  consents  to  the  obtaining  of  such  injunctive 
relief.  The  above  restrictions  will  not  apply  to  any  Confidential  Information  which  (a)  is  rightfully  known  or  is  in  the  rightful  possession  of  the 
receiving party as of the date of its disclosure by the disclosing party; (b) is in the public domain or generally distributed or made available to others 
by  the  disclosing  party  following  the  date  of  its  disclosure  by  the  disclosing  party  without  restriction  as  to  use  or  disclosure;  (c) lawfully  becomes 
known  or  available  to  the  receiving  party  from  third  parties  who  are  not  under  a  similar  agreement  directly  or  indirectly  with  the  disclosing  party 
regarding  disclosure;  (d) independently  developed  by  the  receiving  party  as  evidenced  by  its  written  records,  or  (e) is  required  to  be  disclosed  to 

8735187_3.DOC                                                                Page 1                                                       
enforce  the  terms  of  this  Agreement  or  by  applicable  law,  provided  the  receiving  party  will  notify  the  disclosing  party  as  soon  as  reasonably 
possible prior to such disclosure to afford the disclosing party an opportunity to object or to seek a protective order. 
 
5.          Indemnification.    In  the  event  there  is  a  thirdparty  claim  against  the  Client  or  liability  to  a  third  party,  Foresite  Group  agrees,  to  the 
fullest extent permitted by law, to indemnify and hold harmless Client, its officers, directors and employees against all damages, liabilities or costs, 
including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and  defense  costs,  to  the  extent  caused  by  Foresite  Group's  negligent  performance  of  professional  services 
under  this  Agreement.  Client  agrees,  to  the  fullest  extent  permitted  by  law,  to  indemnify  and  hold  harmless  Foresite  Group,  its  officers,  directors, 
employees, agents and subconsultants against all damages, liabilities or costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and defense costs, to the extent 
caused  by  the  Client's  negligent  acts  in  connection  with  the  Services  and  the  acts  of  its  contractors,  subcontractors  or  consultants  or  anyone  for 
whom  the  Client  is  legally  liable.  Neither  the  Client  nor  Foresite  Group  shall  be  obligated  to  indemnify  the  other  party  in  any  manner  whatsoever 
for  the  other  party's  own  negligence  or  for  the  negligence  of  others.   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  agreement  to  indemnify  and  hold  harmless, 
the  parties  expressly  agree  that  each  party  has  no  duty  to  defend  the  other  from  and  against  any  claims,  causes  of  action,  or  proceedings  of  any 
kind. 
 
6.        Representation. 
6.1.      During the term of the applicable Services, Foresite Group represents that any service rendered by Foresite Group will be performed with 
the care and skill ordinarily used by other members of Foresite Group's profession practicing under similar conditions. 
            
6.2.     FORESITE  GROUP  DOES  NOT  MAKE,  AND  HEREBY  DISCLAIMS,  ANY  AND  ALL  EXPRESS  AND/OR  IMPLIED  WARRANTIES,  INCLUDING,  BUT 
NOT  LIMITED  TO,  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY,  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR  PURPOSE,  NONINFRINGEMENT  AND  TITLE,  AND  ANY 
WARRANTIES  ARISING  FROM  A  COURSE  OF  DEALING,  USAGE,  OR  TRADE  PRACTICE.  FORESITE  GROUP  DOES  NOT  WARRANT  THAT  THE  SERVICES 
WILL BE ERRORFREE.  
 
7.          Limitation of Liability. 
7.1.        NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER  PROVISIONS  OF  THIS  AGREEMENT,  FORESITE  GROUP  WILL  NOT  BE  LIABLE  TO  CLIENT  FOR  ANY 
CONSEQUENTIAL,  INDIRECT  OR  SPECIAL  DAMAGES,  INCLUDING  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  LOSS  OF  PROFITS,  REVENUES  OR  DATA  WITH  RESPECT  TO 
ANY CLAIMS REGARDING THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED HEREUNDER EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER UNDER 
THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE. 
             
7.2.        IN RECOGNITION OF THE RELATIVE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THE SERVICES TO BOTH CLIENT AND FORESITE GROUP, THE RISKS HAVE BEEN 
ALLOCATED  SUCH  THAT  THE  CLIENT  AGREES,  TO  THE  FULLEST  EXTENT  PERMITTED  BY  LAW,  TO  LIMIT  THE  LIABILITY  OF  THE  FORESITE  GROUP  AND 
ITS  OFFICERS,  DIRECTORS,  EMPLOYEES,  SHAREHOLDERS,  OWNERS  AND  SUBCONSULTANTS  FOR  ANY  AND  ALL  CLAIMS,  LOSSES,  COSTS,  DAMAGES 
OF  ANY  NATURE  WHATSOEVER  OR  CLAIMS  EXPENSES  FROM  ANY  CAUSE  OR  CAUSES,  INCLUDING  ATTORNEYS'  FEES  AND  COSTS  AND  EXPERT
WITNESS  FEES  AND  COSTS,  SO  THAT  THE  TOTAL  AGGREGATE  LIABILITY  OF  THE  FORESITE  PARTIES  SHALL  NOT  EXCEED  ONE  HUNDRED  THOUSAND 
DOLLARS  ($100,000),  OR  THE  TOTAL  FEE  FOR  SERVICES  RENDERED  PURSUANT  TO  THE  LETTER  AGREEMENT,  WHICHEVER  IS  GREATER.  IT  IS 
INTENDED  THAT  THIS  LIMITATION  APPLY  TO  ANY  AND  ALL  LIABILITY  OR  CAUSE  OF  ACTION  HOWEVER  ALLEGED  OR  ARISING,  UNLESS  OTHERWISE 
PROHIBITED BY LAW. 
             
7.3.        Notwithstanding  any  provision  to  the  contrary  in  this  Agreement,  if  the  Letter  Agreement  provides  for  the  delivery  of  any  Construction 
Phase  Services  by  Foresite  Group,  Client  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  general  contractor  hired  by  Client  is  solely  responsible  for  the 
construction  of  the  project  and  Foresite  Group  will  not  be  liable  for  the  construction  means,  methods,  techniques,  sequences  or  procedures 
employed by such general contractor or for any and all acts or omissions of any such general contractor, subcontractor, supplier, or otherwise with 
respect to any Construction Phase Services provided by Foresite Group hereunder. 
             
7.4.        Notwithstanding  any  provision  to  the  contrary  in  this  Agreement,  Foresite  Group's  scope  of  Services  does  not  nor  will  not  include  any 
services  related  to  the  environmental  PCBs,  petroleum,  hazardous  waste  or  radioactive  materials  or  compliance  with  any  environmental  health  or 
safety laws.  Client acknowledges and agrees that Client is solely responsible and liable for assessing any environmental health or safety issues with 
respect to any and all Client projects and that Foresite Group is in no event liable for any environmental review or claims. 
 
8.          Subcontracting.  Foresite Group may subcontract its obligations under this Agreement to a third party reasonably acceptable to Client, so 
long  as  Foresite  Group  remains  responsible  for  the  subcontractor's  work  under  the  terms  of  this  Agreement,  and  the  third  party  subcontractor 
agrees to be bound by terms substantially similar to those in this Agreement.   
 
9.          Independent  Contractor.    Both  parties  agree  that  Foresite  Group  is  an  independent  contractor  in  relation  to  Client,  and  will  not  be 
considered an agent or servant of Client.  It is agreed that Foresite Group will have the right to control the details of its Services.  Client and Foresite 
Group agree that in no respect will any employee of Foresite Group be an employee of Client.   
 
10.         Force  Majeure.    Except  for  payment  obligations  hereunder,  neither  party  will  be  liable  for  failure  to  perform  any  of  its  obligations 
hereunder where such performance is prevented or interfered with by riots, wars or hostilities between any nations, acts of God, acts of terrorism, 
fires,  storms,  floods,  earthquakes,  strikes,  labor  disputes,  shortages  or  delays  of  carriers,  shortages  or  curtailments  of  raw  materials,  labor,  power 
or other utility services, and other cause beyond the reasonable control of the parties hereto; provided, in the event a force majeure event delays a 


8735187_3.DOC                                                                Page 2                                                        
party's  performance  by  more  than  thirty  (30)  days,  the  other  party  will  have  the  right  to  terminate  this  Agreement  by  providing  written  notice 
thereof to the delayed party.  This provision will not be construed as relieving either party from its obligation to pay any sums due the other party. 
 
11.         Alternative  Dispute  Resolution.   Any  dispute,  claim  or  controversy  between  the  parties hereto  arising  out  of  or  related  to  the  terms  or 
subject  matter  of this  Agreement shall  be  resolved  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  this  paragraph.   Any claim  by  one  party  must  be  submitted  by 
that  party  (the  "Complaining  Party")  to  the  other  party  (the  "NonComplaining  Party")  in  writing  describing  generally  the  nature  of  the  claim  (the 
"Claim").   The  NonComplaining  Party shall  respond  to  the  Claim in  writing  addressed  to  the  Complaining  Party  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  receipt  of 
the  Claim.   If  the  parties  cannot  resolve  the  claim  themselves  within  fortyfive  (45)  days  following  initial  receipt  of  the  Claim  (the  "Informal 
Resolution  Deadline"),  then  the  Claim  shall  be  submitted  to  mediation,  with the costs  of  such mediation to  be  borne  equally  by each  party.   The 
parties shall  have twenty  (20)  days  from  the Informal  Resolution  Deadline  to  mutually  select  a  mediator.   If  the  parties  are  unable  to  agree  on  a 
mediator  within this  period,  the Claim  will  be  submitted  to  Henning  Mediation  and  Arbitration  Service  in  Atlanta,  Georgia  ("Henning"),  which  will 
select  a mediator  for  the  parties  in  accordance  with  its  policies  and  procedures.   The mediation  must  be  completed within  sixty  (60)  days  of  the 
submission  of  the  Claim  to  Henning.   If  the  parties  are  unsuccessful  in  resolving  the  Claim  through  mediation,  the  mediator  shall  provide  written 
notice  to  the  parties  reflecting  the  same,  and  the  parties  may  then  proceed  to  seek  an  alternative  form  of  resolution  of  the  Claim,  in  accordance 
with the remaining terms of this Agreement and all other rights and remedies afforded to them by law. 
 
12.         Miscellaneous.   This  Agreement,  including  the  Letter  Agreement,  is  the  exclusive  statement  of  the  agreement  between  the  parties  with 
respect  to  the  matters  set  forth  herein,  and  supersedes  all  prior  agreements,  negotiations,  representations  and  proposals,  written  and  oral,  with 
respect  to  the  subject  matter  hereof.   Variance  from,  or  additions  to,  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Agreement  in  any  purchase  order  or  other 
written notification from Client will be of no effect.  This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of 
Georgia,  excluding  its  conflicts  of  laws  rules.    This  Agreement  will  be  binding  upon  and  inure  to  the  benefit  of  the  parties  hereto  and  their 
respective  successors  and  assigns.    Without  prior  written  consent  of  the  nonassigning  party,  neither  party  may  assign  this  Agreement.    If  any 
action at law or in equity is necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party in a final judgment, as determined by the court, 
in  addition  to  any  other  rights  or  remedies  available  to  it,  will  be  entitled  to  recover  attorneys'  fees,  expert  witness  fees,  and  other  expenses 
related to such action.

INTRODUCTION

In adopting these financial management policies, the Mayor and Council recognize that it
is essential that the public have confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the City's
administration of its financial affairs. These policies are intended to provide guidance
and direction to City officials and employees, to establish standard policies for recurring
financial matters, to establish strong internal controls, to establish investment policies, to
conform to legal mandates and to provide for accountability. The Mayor and Council
also recognize that no code or set of rules can be framed which will particularize all the
duties of financial managers or which will cover every conceivable financial
circumstance, and that there may be instances where mechanical compliance is
inconsistent with the general purposes of these policies. Therefore, these policies shall
operate as a general guide, and shall not substitute for common sense and good, honest
judgment.

                         PART I




                 FINANCIAL POLICIES

                 CITY OF NORCROSS, GEORGIA
CITY OF NORCROSS FINANCIAL POLICIES

SECTION I. BUDGET

The budget process provides the primary mechanism by which key decisions are made
regarding the levels and types of services to be provided given the anticipated level of
available resources. Budget policy states how this is done. Budget policy also addresses
the need for financial health and stability.

       A. SCOPE

       This policy applies to all budgeted funds which are the responsibility and under
       the management of the City of Norcross and its General Government
       Administration Services Department.

       B. BALANCED BUDGET

       The budget shall be balanced or have a surplus for each and every budgeted fund.
       Total anticipated revenues plus that portion of existing fund balance in excess of
       authorized reserves that is designated as a budget funding source shall equal or
       exceed total estimated expenditures for each fund.

       C. FINANCING CURRENT EXPENDITURES

       Current expenditures shall be financed with current revenues which shall include
       that portion of existing fund balance in excess of authorized reserves. The City
       shall avoid budgetary procedures that balance current expenditures through the
       obligation of future resources. The City shall strive to avoid short-term
       borrowing to meet operating budget requirements. Nevertheless, this policy shall
       not prohibit short-term borrowing should a critical need arise.

       D. LEVEL OF BUDGET ADOPTION

       All budgets shall be adopted at the legal level of budgetary control which is the
       fund level (i.e., expenditures may not exceed the total appropriation for any fund).

       E. BUDGET OBJECTIVE BY TYPE OF FUND

       The following budget objectives are established for the different types of funds
       utilized by the City:




                                                2
CITY OF NORCROSS FINANCIAL POLICIES

           1. General Fund ­ The budget for the General Fund shall provide for the
              general government operations of the City and maintain working
              capital necessary for financial health and stability.

           2. Debt Service Fund(s) ­ Revenues shall be established and fund
              balance maintained sufficient for debt expenditures and to provide for
              any debt service cash flow deficiencies which would occur prior to the
              receipt of property tax. The City currently has no debt obligations
              other than that in the Water/Sewer Enterprise Fund.

           3. Capital Projects Fund(s) ­ Budgets for capital projects shall not
              lapse at the end of the calendar year, but shall remain in effect until
              project completion or re-appropriation by City Council resolution.

           4. Enterprise Fund(s) ­ A business approach is used in budgeting for

            Enterprise Funds. Enterprises shall be self-supporting when
              possible and minimize losses when break-even is not possible.
              An example of this type of fund is the Water/Sewer Fund.


    F. LINE-ITEM BUDGET

    The budget shall be developed based on "line item" expenditures. This type of
    budget focuses on categories of expenditures such as contractual services,
    supplies, equipment, etc.

    G. PERFORMANCE BUDGET

    In addition to the line item budget, the budget document shall include
    "performance" budget information.             The performance budget provides
    information on the goals and objectives which each department has determined
    that it seeks to accomplish during the budget year. The performance budget also
    utilizes "performance indicators" which measure services rendered and
    departmental efficiency/effectiveness on a historical basis and project targets of
    the indicators for the upcoming budget year. The City shall strive to minimize
    and reduce, if possible, staffing levels required to accomplish its service delivery.




                                             3
CITY OF NORCROSS FINANCIAL SERVICES
    H. BUDGET PREPARATION CATEGORIES

    For each department, budgets shall be prepared for current services, replacement
    vehicles and equipment, and expanded services or extraordinary items. A current
    services budget is defined as that level of funding which is necessary to provide
    the same level of service for the upcoming year that is currently being provided.
    The current services budget will include replacement capital equipment. An
    expanded services budget includes funding requests associated with new services,
    additional personnel or new capital equipment.

    I. BUDGET CONTROL REPORTS

    A system of budgetary controls shall be maintained to assure adherence to the
    budget. Monthly financial statements are prepared on a timely basis comparing
    actual revenues, expenditures and encumbrances with budgeted amounts.

    J. AUTHORIZATION OF BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS

    The budget is a dynamic rather than a static revenue and spending plan which
    requires adjustment from time to time as circumstances change. Approval of the
    Mayor and City Council is required for increases in appropriations in total
    department budgets, or increases in the number of authorized positions. The
    number of authorized positions are those permanent full-time and part-time
    positions approved by the City Council during the annual budget process.
    Approval of the Department Head is required for budget transfers within a
    department.

    K. BUDGET REVIEW
    On or before July 25 of each year, there shall be a mid-year budget review by
    Mayor and Council. This review will be based on the June 30 financial statement.
    The Mayor and Council may require department heads to appear before them to
    review their respective budgets. Such review will be utilized to determine what
    corrective actions need to be taken to exercise proper budgetary control for the
    remainder of the year.

    L. BUDGET AMENDMENT PROCESS

    Near the end of each budget year, any necessary budget adjustments, including
    budgets for any projects authorized during the year, shall be enacted through a
    budget resolution. These supplemental budget resolutions shall be balanced for
    each and every fund. The purpose of budget adjustments is not a new budget, but
    an accounting type of reconciliation of the current year's budget.


                                        4
CITY OF NORCROSS FINANCIAL POLICIES


    M. BUDGET LAPSES AT YEAR END

    All operating budget appropriations, except for Capital projects Fund(s), shall
    expire at the end of a fiscal year. In accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, purchases encumbered in the current year but not received
    until the following year are paid from the budget of the following year. However,
    when necessary, City Council may make a re-appropriation to resolve unusual
    situations or hardships caused by this policy.

    N. UTILIZATION OF PRIOR YEAR'S FUND BALANCE IN BUDGET

    If necessary, existing fund balance in excess of any reserves may be used as a
    funding (revenue) source for that fund's current budget. The amount of
    unreserved fund balance shall be estimated very conservatively.

    O. CONTINGENCY ACCOUNT

    The City shall include a contingency amount in the General Fund budget for
    emergency type expenditures which cannot be foreseen when the budget is
    adopted.    This amount is discretionary and shall be subject to annual
    appropriation and will be no more than 2% of the operating budget or
    $100,000.00, whichever is less.

    P. MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT

    Priority shall be given in budget preparation and enactment for adequate
    maintenance of capital equipment and facilities, and for their orderly replacement.

    Q. CONTRIBUTIONS

    Unless authorized by City Council, contributions to programs operated by City
    departments shall be subject to the City's accounting and budgetary policies. The
    City welcomes both unrestricted contributions, as well as restricted contributions
    compatible with the City's programs and objectives. Any material contributions
    shall be appropriated by City Council prior to expenditure. Written acknowledge-
    ment shall be sent to the donor for contributions of $250 or more.




                                            5
CITY OF NORCROSS FINANCIAL POLICIES

       R. INTERFUND CHARGES

       An Interfund Charge fee may be assessed to any fund, other than the General
       Fund, based upon documentation and/or an outside independent study. This
       charge will be based on a percentage of the operating revenues of the fund and
       shall be used to reimburse the General Fund for the administrative and support
       services provided to the assessed fund. With this system, the transfer to the
       General Fund will increase as fund revenues increase.

       S. GFOA AWARD FOR DISTINGUISHED BUDGET
          PRESENTATION/EXCELLENCE IN FINANCIAL REPORTING

       The City shall improve its budget documentation in order to obtain annually and
       retain the Award for Distinguished Budget Presentation from the Government
       Finance Officers Association. This award signifies that the City is effectively
       communicating its budget story to its citizens, elected and administrative officials,
       and to outside interested parties such as bond rating agencies. The City shall
       continue to improve its budget document as to maintain a high level of
       communication and the prestigious award. The City shall improve its financial
       reporting documentation in order to obtain and retain annually the Certificate of
       Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting from the Government Finance
       Officers Association. This award signifies that the City publishes an easily
       readable and efficiently organized comprehensive annual report, whose contents
       conform to program standards. Such report must satisfy both generally accepted
       accounting principles and applicable legal requirements.


SECTION II. INVESTMENTS AND CASH MANAGEMENT

Investment earnings is an important source of revenue. However, the overriding concern
at all times is the safety and preservation of the City's cash and investments. The ability
to respond efficiently to cash flow requirements is another important consideration.
Therefore, the objective of Investments and Cash Management is to maximize investment
earnings, within an environment that strongly emphasizes legal compliance and safety
while providing cash flow liquidity to meet the City's financial obligations.




                                            6
CITY OF NORCROSS FINANCIAL POLICIES


    A. SCOPE

    This policy applies to all cash and investments which are the responsibility and
    under the management of the City of Norcross and its Financial Services
    Department. Exclusions to this policy include, but are not necessarily limited to,
    the City's Deferred Compensation Fund.

    B. SAFETY

    Funds and resources shall be invested using prudence, judgment and care. The
    primary objective of the investment process shall be safety as well as the
    secondary objective of obtaining competitive market rates of return. Specifically,
    the City shall seek to maximize its safety through the following strategies:

    1. All City investments shall be federally insured or fully collateralized to
       protect investment principal and accrued interest.

    2. Market risk shall be avoided by limiting investments to a maximum two years
       of maturity, except for special circumstances where an interest rate differential
       and certainty of ability to hold the investment to maturity would justify a
       longer maturity.      The Financial Services Director shall approve any
       exceptions to the two-year maturity limit after consultation with the General
       Government Administration Committee, and such exceptions will be
       disclosed to City Council.

    3. Undue credit risk shall be avoided by monitoring the financial condition of
       financial institutions participating in the City's investment program. Financial
       institutions shall provide a consolidated report of condition annually and the
       City shall review creditworthiness at least annually.


    C. LEGAL INVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS

    The City shall invest in only such investment instruments permitted by State of
    Georgia law for local governments which include certificates of deposit,
    repurchase agreements, direct and agency obligations of the United States,
    obligations of the State of Georgia, pooled investment programs of the State of
    Georgia, and no-load mutual funds of direct obligations of the United States.




                                         7
CITY OF NORCROSS FINANCIAL POLICIES

       D. COMPETITIVE INVESTMENT RATES

       The City shall seek competitive rates within its safety criteria. Maximum

       economy.

       E. LIQUIDITY

       Provision shall be made for adequate liquidity of investments so that the City can
       efficiently meet, without incurring financial penalty, disbursement and cash flow

       for the purpose of eliminating idle cash and maximizing invested funds.

       G. INVESTMENT REPORTING

       The Financial Services Department shall continue to prepare monthly reports of
       investments. These reports are included as part of the City's monthly financial
       statements. Efforts shall be made to improve reporting and accounting in order to
       calculate monthly interest accruals and composite yields on the City's investment
       portfolio.

    A. CHARGES FOR UTILITY SERVICES

    The City of Norcross bills and collects utility service charges for electricity,
    water, sewer, security lights, natural gas and solid waste collection. All charges
    are billed in one bill. The Public Works/Utilities Administration department is
    responsible for the billing of utility services. The General Government
    Administration department is responsible for the collection, receipt and recording
    of utility payments. Mayor and Council are responsible for establishing a
    schedule of rates for the various utility services. The schedule of rates shall be
    maintained on file in the office of the General Government Administration where
    it shall be available for inspection by the public.

    All bills for utility services are payable, in full, upon receipt and shall be deemed
    late after the 10th of the month. Customers shall be subject to a 10% penalty after
    the 10th. Service will be discontinued for non-payment after the mailing of a
    disconnect notice on the 16th of the north. Customers will be given 48 hours after
    the mailing of the notice to remit payment or disconnect will occur.

    B. PROPERTY TAXES

    The Mayor and Council assesses, levies and collects an ad valorem tax on all real
    and personal property within the corporate limits of the City that is subject to such
    taxation by the state and county. The purpose of this tax is to raise revenue to
    defray the costs of operating the City government, provide governmental services
    to its citizens, the repayment of principal and interest on general obligations, if
    applicable, and any other public purpose as determined by the City Council.

    The milage rate is established annually by Mayor and Council for general
    governmental purposes and debt service purposes. All ad valorem taxes on real
    and personal property are due as established by ordinance. Certain exemptions
    (homestead and senior citizen) may apply to the tax assessment. However, it is
    the responsibility of the recipient of such exemptions to file with the Financial
    Services Department for eligibility of such exemptions.

    Delinquent taxes are assessed a penalty fee on the amount due and interest
    accrues monthly on the balance of the account until paid in full. After tax
    assessments have been delinquent for thirty (30) days, a certified, return receipt
    required letter will be sent to the property owner. If the tax assessment is not paid




                                          9
CITY OF NORCROSS FINANCIAL POLICIES

    in full within thirty (30) days from receipt of this registered letter, the City will
    file a fi fa against the taxpayer. The cost of filing this fi fa will be added to the
    property owner's account. After a fi fa is filed against the property, the City shall,
    without further notice and after a reasonable amount of time, publish the name
    and amount due of the delinquent property tax owner in the current legal organ of
    the City.

    At the discretion of Mayor and Council, and after all reasonable and legal avenues
    have been exhausted for collection of the delinquent taxes and charges,
    procedures for sales under tax executions, as provided for by ordinance, shall be
    instituted against the property, provided that it is reasonably anticipated that the
    sale will yield proceeds in excess of execution costs and any other superior liens.

    C. OCCUPATION AND BUSINESS TAXES

    Mayor and Council, by ordinance, levies certain taxes on both individuals and
    corporations who transact business in the City, including but not limited to,
    hotel/motel tax, franchise tax, alcohol beverage tax and occupation tax. The City
    Council classifies businesses, occupations, professions or callings for the purpose
    of this taxation in any way which is lawful and deemed necessary and appropriate.

           1. Hotel/Motel Tax ­Tax is levied, provided by ordinance, at a
              percentage of the gross rental charge of any guest room in the City to

              assessment are as outlined in the hotel/motel tax ordinance.
              Exemptions, as provided by City Council, include but are not limited
              to: rental furnished to one (1) occupant for a period of more than ten
              (10) consecutive days or for use as meeting rooms, rental furnished for
              a period of one (1) or more days for use by the United States of
              America, the state or any political subdivision or municipality when
              traveling on official business.

               The due date for the hotel/motel tax is provided for by ordinance. The
               delinquent amount will accrue interest monthly, or a fraction thereof,
               from the original due date of the tax. The City shall have the right to
               revoke an operator's business license for certain violations of the
               ordinance. Penalty for violation will be as provided for by City
               ordinance.

CITY OF NORCROSS FINANCIAL POLICIES

           2. Franchise Tax ­ The City grants franchises for the use of the
              City's streets for the purpose of utility companies (electric,
               telephone, cable, gas), transportation companies (railroads) and
               other similar organizations. The duration, terms and provisions
              are determined by City Council and in accordance with state
              laws. All franchises must register with the City.

           3. Alcohol Beverage Tax - Alcoholic beverages may be sold in the
              City under a license issued by City Council. A specific excise tax is
              levied on malt beverages, wine and distilled spirits as provided by state
              law. Each wholesale dealer must file a report and pay the tax due by
              the tenth (10th) day of each month, showing for the preceding calendar
              month the exact quantities by size and type of container sold during
              that month within the City. Penalty and interest for delinquency and
              penalty for violation are provided for by City ordinance.

           4. Occupation Tax ­ City Council, by ordinance, provides for the
               assessment and collection of an annual occupation tax on certain
               businesses and practitioners of professions and occupations
              located or exerting substantial efforts in the City of Norcross. The City
              shall impose an annual non-prorated, non-refundable administrative fee
              for each business required to pay an occupation tax under this
              ordinance. A regulatory fee may be imposed on those applicable
              businesses. The methods for computation of the occupation tax is
              based on the number of employees. Penalty and interest for
              delinquency and penalty for violation are provided for by City
              ordinance.

    D. LICENSES AND PERMIT FEES

    The City Council, by ordinance, requires individuals and corporations who
    transact business in the City to obtain and pay a reasonable fee for a license or
    permit for such activity. Reasonable requirements are established for obtaining
    and keeping such licenses as the public health, safety and welfare necessitates.
    Such licenses and fees include, but are not limited to, development and building
    permits and liquor licenses.

    E. USER FEES

    The City Council, by ordinance, assesses and collects fees and charges for various
    governmental services rendered within and outside the corporate limits of the City




                                        11
CITY OF NORCROSS FINANCIAL POLICIES

    for the total cost to the City of providing such services. Delinquent accounts may
    be assessed penalty and interest by approval of City Council. Such services
    rendered include, but are not limited to solid waste, utilities, health, administrative
    and recreation programs
    .
    F. FINES AND FORFEITURES

    City government (Municipal Court) as outlined in the City Charter. Collection of
    these revenues follows state law and requirements.

    G. OTHER REVENUES

    The City Council may collect various miscellaneous revenues from fees assessed
    for services of a non-recurring nature. Assessment and collection of these
    revenues will follow the City's policy on other delinquent taxes and fees or as set
    by City ordinance if applicable.


    H. COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT TAXES AND FEES

    The City Council by ordinance shall provide generally for the collection of
    delinquent taxes, fees or other revenues due to the City by whatever reasonable
    means as are not precluded by general state law. This shall include providing for
    the dates when the taxes or fees are due; late penalties or interest; issuance and
    execution of fi fa's; creation and priority of liens; making delinquent taxes or fees
    personal debts of the persons required to pay the taxes or fees imposed; revoking
    city licenses and permits for failure to pay any city taxes or fees; allowing
    exceptions for hardship; and providing for the assignment or transfer of tax
    executions. Delinquent tax accounts over ten (10) years old will be written off as
    part of the year-end and audit process. Delinquent tax accounts over five (5)
    years old and less than $50.00 in amount due will also be written off as part of the
    year-end audit process.

    date. Any returned checks not paid within ninety (90) days will be submitted to
    the City Marshal for further legal action with the intent to collect.

                          PART II




                EXPENDITURE POLICIES

                 CITY OF NORCROSS, GEORGIA
CITY OF NORCROSS EXPENDITURE POLICIES

INTRODUCTION

The following policies on expenditures will be adopted for the City of Norcross. Other
than the specific exceptions indicated, this policy is intended to apply equally to elected
officials and to all levels of employees. The term "department" shall be interpreted to
include all departments of City Government. All expenditures authorized under this
policy shall be subject to the availability of funds. It is the specific intent of this policy
that the basic guideline in determining whether an expenditure is appropriate is the
benefit of that expenditure to the City.

SECTION I. LICENSE FEES, MEMBERSHIP DUES AND SEMINARS

A. Expenditures are authorized for fees to maintain any license or certification which is
   required as a condition of employment and for dues to professional organizations and
   associations relevant to an official's or employee's duties for the City. Payment of
   costs to attend job-related training and seminars is also authorized.

B. The number of organizations to which dues are paid for one individual and the
   number of seminars that one individual may attend annually shall be held to
   reasonable limits. In regard to City employees, questions of reasonableness will be
   referred to the respective department committee.

SECTION II. MAGAZINE AND NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTIONS

A. Expenditures are authorized for subscriptions to professionally relevant magazines
   and newspapers for City departments and/or divisions. This authorization includes
   subscriptions to the local newspapers and the Atlanta Journal ­ Constitution for those
   departments and/or divisions which need to keep abreast of local news.

B. Subscriptions to general interest magazines and newspapers (i.e.,Time, USA Today)
   shall not be paid from City Funds.

SECTION III. OFFICE FURNISHINGS AND ACCESSORIES

A. Work space suitable for the job function and position will be provided. Distinction
   in furnishings and size of the office may be made based upon the function of the
   position.




                                             14
CITY OF NORCROSS EXPENDITURE POLICIES

B. Furnishings and decorations shall be efficient, comfortable and in good taste;
   however, luxurious furnishings and decorations shall not be purchased at City
   expense. All items shall be acquired through normal City purchasing policies and
   procedures.

C. City funds used to purchase art work for individual offices should be done at the
   discretion and authority of the Department Director using the "reasonable person"
   theory. Expenditures are authorized to furnish art work for hallways, reception areas,
   conference rooms commonly used by the public, and other publicly used common
   areas.

D. City funds shall not be used to pay for framing of personal art, certificates, etc.,
   except for certificates, resolutions or proclamations that are given as awards by the
   City or earned as a function of employment with the City.


SECTION IV. EMPLOYEE APPRECIATION ACTIVITIES

A. Expenditures are authorized for costs of the annual City-wide employee appreciation
   picnic, including all elected officials and City employees and their spouses/guests.
   This event presents an exception to the general rule that the City shall not pay
   expenses for spouses or other guests of an official or employee.

B. Expenditures are authorized to pay for a modest gift or certificate for retiring and/or
   resigning employees. City funds may be used to pay for a luncheon or reception to
   commemorate a retiring employee.

C. No City funds shall be used to pay for a departmental social function except as
   specifically authorized herein.

SECTION V. CHARITABLE SUBSIDIES AND CONTRIBUTIONS

A. The City Council shall be authorized to expend city funds within Gwinnett
   County for purely charitable purposes provided only, however, that the citizens of
   Norcross receive a direct consideration or benefit in return for such expenditure:

   1. Pursuant to the terms of a contract or agreement with a charitable organization or
      entity, and

   2. Upon a majority vote by the members of the Mayor and City Council.




                                           15
CITY OF NORCROSS EXPENDITURE POLICIES
B. Neither the Mayor, nor any members of the City Council, nor City employee shall be
   authorized under any circumstances whatsoever to be reimbursed with City funds for
   any expenditure, donation or contribution for purely charitable purposes except as
   specifically authorized in this section.

SECTION VI. TRAVEL EXPENSES

A. Introduction ­ These regulations provide guidelines for elected officials and
   employees who are required to travel away from their official headquarters in the
   course of performing their official duties. Each elected official and employee
   required to travel is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable, necessary and allowable
   expenses incurred. Members of boards of commissions and authorities who travel on
   City related educational seminars and training will fall under these guidelines. These
   regulations are intended to indicate what constitutes reasonable and necessary
   expenditures and to provide uniformity among the various departments and offices of
   City Government. These regulations are designed to encompass major areas
   pertaining to travel while allowing departments flexibility to deal with unusual travel
   circumstances that are not addressed herein by requesting specific authorization for
   deviations from Mayor and Council.

B. Statement of Policy ­ It is the City's policy to allow travel arrangements on a limited
   basis provided (a) travel appropriations are available; (b) travel is duly authorized;
   and (c) travel is within the scope of the employee's employment and discharge of his
   (her) official duties. Elected officials and employees are expected to show good
   judgment and a proper regard for economy in incurring travel expenses. Required
   records must be kept of expenditures at the time incurred, submitted on the
   appropriate expense report and completed in strict accordance with these regulations.

C. Travel Authorization ­ Employees required to travel in the performance of official
   duties and entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred must receive prior
   authorization from the Department Director one week before travel. Blanket routine
   travel authorization may be granted. Elected officials may authorize their own travel
   provided it is properly budgeted. Out-of-state or overnight travel must be specifically
   authorized in writing by the Department Head or elected official.                     The
   aforementioned requirement for prior authorization of out-of-state travel pertains to
   ordinary anticipated travel such as workshops, conferences or seminars. Some travel,
   such as police investigations or prisoner transfer, by its very nature, precludes a one
   week lead time. This unforeseeable travel will be exempt from the prior
   authorization requirement; but the department director will be responsible for
   making certain that funds are available for these travel expenditures.




                                            16
CITY OF NORCROSS EXPENDITURE POLICIES

D. Subsistence ­ Reimbursement claims for subsistence (meals and lodging) are
   to be reported on the Travel and Expense Reimbursement Form by date, location and
   amount. An individual taking annual leave while away from headquarters on official
   business is not entitled to subsistence for the period of leave. Subsistence within a
   40-mile radius of an individual's headquarters is, with certain exceptions (as
   presented in the City's Expenditure Policy), not allowable. Any exception not
   specifically provided for within the Expenditure Policy should be approved by a
   Department Director based upon written justification for the exception and submitted
   with the request for reimbursement. In the case of an elected official, the official
   should provide written documentation for the expenses with the reimbursement
   request.

   1. Meals ­ Elected officials and employees will be reimbursed for the cost of meals
      within reasonable limits. In normal circumstances it is expected that dinner
      should cost more than lunch and lunch more than breakfast. Employees are
      entitled to reimbursement for breakfast expenses if they depart prior to 6:30 a.m.
      and for dinner expenses if they return later than 7:30 p.m. This entitlement is
      based on the premise that early departure and late return times as provided above
      are out of necessity and not at the discretion or convenience of the employee.
      Meals that are officially part of the activities associated with a conference or
      seminar may exceed the normal meal allowances, but under no circumstances
      should an employee claim reimbursement for the same meal more than once.

       Out-of-state travel expenses for meals may be higher, but the cost of the meals
       should remain reasonable and any unusual amounts should be justified and
       explained. Reimbursement for meals not associated with overnight travel or for
       meals within the 40-mile radius of the employee's work headquarters may be
       permissible in certain instances. See Section VII of the Expenditure Policy for
       details regarding these exceptions.

   2. Lodging ­ Reimbursement for lodging will require hotel receipts and will be
      made for the actual amount of the bill. Travelers should always endeavor to
      obtain suitable accommodations at the most economical rates available. It is
      expected that reservations will be made in advance whenever practical, that
      minimum rate accommodations available will be utilized, that "deluxe" hotels and
      motels will be avoided and that commercial rates will be obtained whenever
      possible. Many hotels and motels grant commercial rates to government
      employees upon request. Exceptions on lodging rates is allowable when the
      employee is staying either at a hotel officially associated with the conference or
      seminar that the individual is attending, or staying at nearby accommodations in
      order to avoid excessive transportation costs. Exceptions may also be justified
      when the travel is of an emergency nature




                                              17
CITY OF NORCROSS EXPENDITURE POLICIES

       When a room is shared with other city employees on travel status, reimbursement
       will be calculated, if practical, on a pro rata share of the total cost. A city
       employee on travel status, if accompanied by someone who is not a city employee
       on travel status, will be entitled to reimbursement at the lowest applicable room
       rate. Reimbursement for lodging shall be limited to the minimum number of
       nights required to conduct the assigned city business.

       Taxes associated with lodging will be treated as part of lodging costs. When
       traveling in the State of Georgia, City employees must use the hotel/motel tax
       exempt status form and should obtain a supply of this form prior to departure. If
       forms are not available in the employee's department, they may be obtained from
       the Department of Financial Services. The same requirements apply to sales tax
       associated with lodging. A sales tax exempt status form should be presented to
       the hotel/motel. This form is also available in the Department of Financial
       Services. Employees will not be reimbursed for hotel/motel tax or sales tax
       incurred when traveling within the State without approval of the Financial
       Services Director for extenuating circumstances

E. Transportation
   1. Vehicles ­ When traveling within the State of Georgia, travelers may choose
      between using a personal vehicle or common carrier.

       Departments should approve transportation based on the most economical mode,
       consistent with the purpose of the travel. City owned vehicles should be driven
       for overnight travel only with the express authorization of the pertinent
       Department Director and only when driving a personal vehicle or using a common
       carrier is not feasible, i.e., transport of prisoners.

       The reimbursement for transportation expenses incurred by use of personally
       owned vehicles will be at the current Federal Government rate per mile. The
       initial point of departure shall be the individual's residence or work headquarters;
       whichever is nearer the destination point. No transportation costs will be allowed
       between an employee's place of residence and his official headquarters. When
       possible, employees should attempt to travel together to the same destination in
       one vehicle.

       Personal mileage will be excluded in determining the mileage for which
       reimbursement will be made. Claims exceeding mileage computed by the most
       direct route from the point of departure to destination (due to field visits, picking
       up passengers, etc.) must be explained on the Travel and Expense Reimbursement
       Form..




                                                18
CITY OF NORCROSS EXPENDITURE POLICIES
       The authorized mileage rate is intended to cover the normal expenses incurred in
       the operation of a personal vehicle. In addition, parking and toll expenses will be
       paid for official travel in personal or city vehicles. A receipt should be provided.

       The use of commercially leased vehicles will be left to the discretion of the Mayor
       and Council and will be approved with prior written justification for the
       expenditure. Employees will be reimbursed for costs associated with the official
       use of such vehicles, where the leasing of a vehicle is either essential to the travel
       involved or is the most economical mode of travel. The ability to stay in more
       inexpensive lodging may be considered when deciding whether to allow the rental
       of a vehicle.

       Employees sharing a ride with another city employee using either a personal or
       City vehicle, and not claiming reimbursement for mileage should indicate in the
       automobile record section of the expense statement the name of the person they
       rode with and the dates of the trip(s).

       Officials and employees shall be reimbursed for mileage related to City business
       driven locally in their personal vehicle.

   2. Common Carrier ­ Transportation by common carrier will be scheduled by plane,
      bus or rail. Reimbursement will be made upon presentation of a ticket stub,
      receipt or other documentary evidence of expenditure. Officials or employees
      traveling by commercial air carrier will not be reimbursed for that portion of first
      class air fare which exceeds the amount of the regular coach fare for the flight on
      which such official or employee is traveling unless space is not otherwise
      available. Every effort should be made to reserve seats far enough in advance to
      take advantage of any discount fares.

   3. Taxi Service ­ Shuttle or taxi service will be reimbursed between the individual's
      departure point and the common carrier's departure point; between the common
      carrier's arrival point and the individual's lodging or meeting place; and between
      the lodging and meeting place if at difference locations. It is expected that the
      most economical transportation service that is feasible and available will be
      utilized. Receipts are necessary for such items of transportation

F. Miscellaneous Expenses ­ Registration fees required for participation in workshops
   seminars or conferences which an employee is directed and/or authorized to attend




                                                19
CITY OF NORCROSS EXPENDITURE POLICIES

   will be allowed when supported by a paid receipt or copy of the check showing
   payment. Tips related to services other than meals should be included under
   miscellaneous expenses.

   Expenses for official telephone messages which must be paid for by the traveler
   are allowable. Every official or employee will be allowed up to two personal long
   distance phone call per day, while out of town on City business. Postage expense
   incurred relative to travel will be allowed. Claims for theater, entertainment
   and alcoholic beverages will not be reimbursed.

G. Reimbursement Procedures ­ A diligent effort should be made by the department
   directors and persons responsible for approving claims for travel reimbursement to
   see that expense statements submitted are reasonable, accurate and cover only
   expenses actually incurred by an employee traveling in the interest of the city. When
   claims for reimbursement exceed established limits, a written explanation should be
   made on the statement explaining these higher amounts. These claims should be
   closely reviewed and department directors should adjust downward any excessive
   expenditure before approval and remittance to the Department of Financial Services.

   1. Frequency ­ Employees should submit travel expense statements for re-
      imbursement within 30 days after returning from the trip.

   2. Travel Expense Statement ­ Employees requesting reimbursement for travel
      expenses must submit claims on the standard Travel and Expense Reimbursement
      Form.

H. Travel Advances ­ Travel advances may be granted subject to certain guidelines
   given below. Travel advance checks may be issued to employees provided it is (1)
   solely for travel involving official city business, (2) authorized by Department
   Director or elected official, and (3) funds have been appropriated and are available.
   The amount of the travel advance shall be determined according to the nature and
   probable duration of the travel required on the travel authorization but shall be held
   to a minimum and allowed only when an advance is warranted in the judgment of the
   department director or elected official. Travel advance requests must be made on a
   purchase order and submitted to the Department of Financial Services at least one
   week prior to the beginning of travel. When submitting travel advances to Financial
   Services, attach information to the advance concerning registration fees, hotel
   reservations and any other documentation to justify requests. Cashing of the advance
   check shall be considered acknowledgment of the receipt of the funds by the payee of
   the check. All employees are fully responsible for travel funds advanced to them and
   shall account for these funds on a Travel and Expense Reimbursement Form.




                                             20
CITY OF NORCROSS EXPENDITURE POLICIES

   Ultimately, however, department directors or elected officials have the responsibility
   of accounting for all funds expended for travel purposes by employees that report to
   them.

   Travel advances are expected to be settled within 30 days of the employee's return.
   Any unsettled advance for more than 30 days from the date of issue will be deemed to
   be a salary advance. After the 30-day period, the employee and the travel authorizer
   will be notified that the whole advance will be deducted from the employee's salary
   unless settled immediately.

    Travel advances shall be adjusted to actual expenditures in the following manner:

       1. When the actual travel expenditures reported on the travel statement exceed
          the amount of the travel advance, the employee shall be reimbursed for the
          amount of the excess.
       2. When the actual travel expenditures reported on the travel statement are less
          than the amount of the travel advance, the employee shall reimburse the city
          for the difference. The reimbursement to the city shall be by check or money
          order in order to eliminate the possibility of loss of cash. This reimbursement
          shall be made at the same time that the travel statement is submitted.
       3. In the event of cancellation or indefinite postponement of authorized travel,
          advances which were made shall be refunded immediately. (Within 48 hours
          of the date the trip was canceled.)

       NOTE: Employees should be aware that certain travel-related expenditures may
       be tax-deductible and reimbursements may be taxable. Each individual is
       responsible for determining how expenditures and reimbursements should be
       handled when filing his/her income tax forms.


SECTION VII. MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES

   or a member of his (her) immediate family. Immediate family is defined as spouse,
   parents, step-parents, parents in-law, grandparents, children, step-children, children
   in-law, grandchildren, siblings, step-sibling and sibling in-law. City funds may be

                PURCHASING POLICIES

                 CITY OF NORCROSS, GEORGIA
CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of these purchasing policies and procedures is to provide guidance to
personnel engaged in the purchasing process throughout the City of Norcross.

These purchasing policies and procedures provide assistance to all departments in the
City by promoting the obtainment of the best material or service of the highest quality at
the best possible price. This objective can be accomplished only if all of the departments
are familiar with proper purchasing policies and procedures as required by law and local
guidelines.

The responsibility of each department shall include the purchase and distribution of
supplies, materials, property, equipment and inventory pursuant to policies and
procedures established by the Mayor and Council and in accordance with this manual and
the laws of the State. The discharge of these duties will include the establishment of
reliable and reputable sources of supply, the fostering of competition and good
procurement practices consistent with timely accomplishment of its goals.

These policies and procedures will provide reference for questions that may arise in
regard to purchasing requirements. Compliance with the provisions of this manual is
mandatory. No provision is intended to conflict with state or local statutes, in which
case, the provisions of the State or local statutes shall apply.

Any employee not complying with the rules and regulation of this manual shall be subject
to disciplinary action in accordance with applicable personnel policies.

SECTION I. GENERAL INFORMATION

All acquisitions for goods and services over $10.00 on behalf of the City of Norcross
shall be made with a purchase order generated by the issuing department. Goods and
services obtained otherwise without proper authorization will become the property of the
purchaser, and will in no manner be the responsibility of the City of Norcross.

It is the department's responsibility to properly pre-plan for the purchase of goods and
needed services. This will assist in assuring continuity in departmental operations.

Departments are encouraged to seek the assistance of other personnel as early in the
acquisition process as possible and as is necessary. It is at this point that the using
departments can realize the major benefits provided by the purchasing policies.

All documents and forms are to have original department or division head signatures
only. Stamps, facsimiles, and other alternate methods will not be accepted. Any form or




                                           23
CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES
document forwarded to Financial Services in this manner will be returned to the
requesting department.

PURCHASING OBJECTIVE

Procurement of materials, supplies and services is an important function of the City's
organization. Ultimately, the services which the City provides to its citizens are
dependent upon these materials and supplies. In order to obtain the greatest value for
every dollar spent, it is necessary to follow a set of policies when purchases are made.

Purchasing procedures are designed to meet the following objectives:
       (1) To encourage the reduction and eventual elimination of small orders and
           emergency purchases.
       (2) To encourage advanced planning.
       (3) To reduce paper work through combined purchases.
       (4) To encourage competitive purchasing.
       (5) To encourage cooperative intergovernmental purchasing by departments.
       (6) To conduct City business in such an open manner that potential vendors may
           be impressed by the fairness of the system and thus be encouraged to furnish
           competition which will ensure that the City will secure the lowest price at all
           times.
       (7) To provide inspection of purchases to determine that goods delivered meet the
           specifications established.
       (8) To provide budget control and to ensure the financial stability of the City.
       (9) To assure that the greatest value is received for the tax dollar expended.
      (10) To supplement other internal control policies

B. PURCHASING ETHICS

Public confidence in the integrity of purchasing practices is very important. Therefore,
our purchasing policy includes a Code of Ethics. The following ethical practices should
govern the conduct of every person employed by the City of Norcross.
       (1) People involved in public purchasing are in full accord with the
            professional principles of public purchasing and are confident that we
            are qualified to serve under these principles to the advantage of the
            public jurisdiction which employs us.
       (2) We believe in the dignity and worth of the service rendered by government
            and of our own social responsibility as trusted public servants.
       (3) We are governed by the highest ideals of honor and integrity in all public and
            personal relationships in order that we may merit the respect and inspire the
            confidence of the agency and of the public which we serve.




                                           24
     CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES

     (4) We believe that government employees should not accept valuable gifts,
         favors or benefits from vendors under circumstances which might be
         construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of our
         governmental duties.

     (5) We believe that personal aggrandizement or personal profit obtained
         through misuse of public or personal relationships is dishonest.

     (6) We keep the public jurisdiction which employs us informed, through
         appropriate channels, on problems and progress of the agency which we
         serve, but keep ourselves in the background by emphasizing the importance
         of the facts.

     (7) We do not seek or dispense personal favors. We handle each administrative
         problem objectively, without discrimination, on the basis of principle and
         justice.

     (8) We recognize that our purchasing activities are of public interest and a
         matter of public record, and so conduct our operations so that all actions
         can be fully substantiated and legally defended in accordance with the
         awarding authority of the agency which we serve. To this end we maintain
         adequate records on all purchases as to class of purchase, prices paid,
         source of supply, and justification of award. However, we shall not disclose
         any information which might be detrimental to the public interest.

     (9) We constantly endeavor to keep ourselves and members of our staff free
         from involvement which would place either in a position of possible "conflict
         of interest."

    (10) Insofar as is practical, we employ the practice of open competitive bidding
         based upon adequate and open specifications.

SECTION II. POLICY SUMMARY AND GUIDELINES

     A. PURCHASING POLICY SUMMARY

     The Mayor and City Council has directed that all Departments must comply with
     the City's purchasing policies. Any agency doing business through the City will
     at all times follow these purchasing policies. Financial Services will be
     responsible for developing and maintaining the necessary forms for the City's
     purchasing functions. Purchases will be approved by the Department Director or
     his designee and submitted to Financial Services. All purchases above $10.00




                                            25
CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES
require a purchase order. Competitive sealed bids or proposals from at least three
bidders (wherever reasonably possible) should be secured first for purchases or
services over $10,000.00. If three bids for purchases are unobtainable, an
explanation should be documented with the purchase request. City Council action
is required for all purchases and services where cost is $10,000 or greater and
where cost is $5,000 or greater for purchases and services that have not been
approved in the budget.

Membership dues, subscriptions, advertising, seminar fees and out-of-town
expenses require a purchase order. Repairs and service calls should be processed
in the same manner as purchases (including vehicle repairs). When cost is not
determinable, the rate per hour and/or a minimum service charge should be
submitted. A "not to exceed" figure should be requested. It will be the
responsibility of the department to plan ahead in order to minimize inconvenience
and delays due to delivery. For emergency needs refer to the Emergency
Purchases Section.

Developing formal procedures is the primary role of the Financial Services
Department. Financial Services will sometimes act on behalf of all departments
for similar items such as office supplies in order to maximize volume discounts
and insure availability of stock. Standardization will be employed whenever
possible to minimize costs to the City. Participation in State contracts for items
will be utilized and a reference file shall be maintained by affected department of
current items available.

It is the intent that these policies be administered by the Financial Services
Department in order to control costs, insure legal compliance, adhere to
accounting and audit requirements and maintain the integrity of the City of
Norcross.

The dollar limits for quotes and bids which will govern the proper procedure for
the purchase of goods and services are as follows:

       1. Less than or equal to $10.00. No purchase order is required.
       2. $10.00 to $999.99. A purchase order is required. Only one quote is
          needed. However, Financial Services recommends obtaining other
          quotes when time permits in order to obtain the best possible price for
          the City.
       3. $1,000.00 to $2,499.99. A purchase order is required along with a
          minimum of three (3) telephone quotes attached to the purchase order.
       4. $2,500.00 to $9,999.99. A purchase order is required along with a
          minimum of three (3) written quotes attached to the purchase order.




                                    26
    CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES
              Reasonable efforts will be made to solicit written quotes from all
              responsible qualified vendors.
           5. $10,000.00 and over. A purchase order is required along with three
              (3) competitive sealed bids. Reasonable efforts will be made to solicit
              sealed bids from the broadest possible list of qualified vendors. The
              purchase must be approved by formal action of the City Council.
           6. Purchase orders in excess of a $1,000.00 must be signed by the mayor
              and one council member or two council members.

.   The practice of dividing the purchase of substantially similar goods or services
    into two or more purchase orders or contracts in order to evade the requirements
    applicable to purchases of $2,500 and over is strictly prohibited.

    Exemptions to the purchasing limitations are as follows:

           Exemptions

                  computer systems), except where a greater savings can be realized
                  by a quantity purchase,
           3.     Real property, real estate brokerage and appraising, abstract of

           12.    Items for resale, that require a particular manufacturer to enhance
                  their marketability,

                  Commission, Zoning Board of Appeals, and other boards that are
                  required by law to publicly advertise their meetings or actions.



                                               27
CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES
       14.      Sole Source Vendors. Occasionally there are items purchased by
                the City that are only available from one vendor/manufacturer.
                This should be noted in a memo to Financial Services and attached
                to the purchase order.
       15.      Reimbursed Purchases. Items that are purchased through the City
                of Norcross for an outside source and will be reimbursed to the
                City are not required to be approved by the City Council and may
                be approved by the Department Head after prices are obtained
                through the less formal method of bidding. (Example: Water
                meters for hotels).


B. PURCHASING GUIDELINES

The following guidelines will apply to purchases made for the City of Norcross:
       (1) Always obtain the price of any item before agreeing to buy it or
            before ordering it.
       (2) If possible and practicable, always obtain three competitive prices.
       (3) If possible and practicable, always obtain written quotations.
       (4) Determine the quantity discounts available and obtain them if
            possible.
       (5) Obtain discounts where possible due to volume of business.
       (6) Request discount terms on invoice payment and record them on
           purchase order
       (7) Wherever possible, negotiate for deliveries F.O.B. Norcross.

Department Heads have the responsibility and authority to expend the funds
budgeted for the operation of their department. Department Heads are expected
to control expenditures to these budgeted amounts and to effect savings where
possible. It is the responsibility of Financial Services staff to assist departments
with efforts toward this end.

C. PURCHASE ORDERS

             Standard purchase orders are generated by computer and essentially
             duplicate all information input from a requisition. Copies are
             distributed as follows:
                 Original ­ (Vendor) ­ vendor copy.
                 Yellow Copy ­ (GGA) ­ numerical file copy.
                 Pink Copy ­ (Department) -department copy to be sent to
                 accounts payable for payment. After payment returned to
                 department for record keeping.
                 Green Copy ­ (Receiving) ­ department receiving.



                                        28
       CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES
       It is inappropriate for a purchase order to be issued after the fact. The purchase
       order also represents a contract that someone will provide items and/or labor for
       an agreed upon price.

       D. VENDORS

       It is the responsibility of each department to establish a relationship of mutual
       confidence and satisfaction between the City and its suppliers. The City's policy
       in regard to vendors will be as follows:

               1. All vendors' representatives will be received by each department.
               2. Financial Services will inform, or pass along to department heads,
                  useful information received from interviews, catalogs, advertising, etc.
               3. Any arrangements made with vendor representatives for the purchase
                  of goods or services by departmental personnel without proper
                  purchasing procedures will not be acknowledged or upheld by the City
                  of Norcross. The good or service will become the personal liability of
                  the individual making commitment to the vendor for the unauthorized
                  purchase.


SECTION III. REQUISITION AND BUDGET REQUIREMENTS

It is the City's policy that expenditures do not exceed established budget restraints. Each
department has the responsibility and authority to expend only the funds appropriated per
budget for the operation of their department.

By direction of Mayor and Council it is necessary and required that any expenditures
from appropriations for a given budget year be utilized and paid prior to the end of that
fiscal year. Materials and services ordered prior to but received after December 31 of
each budget year will be encumbered at year-end and charged to the current year's
budget. Every effort should be made to request materials and services before December
1st in order to retain that expenditure or expense in the current year's budget. Only
normal operating costs will be considered from December 1st to January 1st. No purchase
orders will be issued after December 15th of each budget year except for emergency
purchases for operating purposes only.

SECTION IV. BIDS AND CONTRACTS

       A. GENERAL GUIDELINES
              Bid and contract procedures should be in compliance with adopted
              policies conducted in a fair, consistent manner which encourages
              competitive purchasing practices and maximizes the City's purchasing
              power for each tax dollar.

                                                     29
   CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES

   The following terminology may be required in bids and requests for proposals
   depending on the commodity or service being purchased.

   Insurance
   The contractor shall maintain the following insurance: (a) comprehensive
   general liability, including blanket contractual, covering bodily injuries with
   limits of no less than $1,000,000.00 per occurrence, and property damage with
   limits of no less than $500,000.00 per occurrence; (b) statutory worker's
   compensation insurance, including employer's liability insurance; and (c)
   employee dishonesty and/or crimes coverage with respect to personnel of the
   contractor having access to City buildings, with limits of no less than $50,000.00
   per occurrence. All insurance shall be provided by an insurer(s) acceptable to the
   City, and shall provide for thirty (30) days prior notice of cancellation to the City.
   Upon request, the contractor shall deliver to the city a certificate or policy of
   insurance evidencing the contractors compliance with this policy. The contractor

   impair or invalidate the coverage; (c) employee dishonesty and/or crimes
   coverage with respect to personnel of the contractor having access to City
   buildings, with limits of no less than $50,000.00 per occurrence.
   Bonding Requirements
              Bid bonds, performance and payment bonds shall be required for all
              contracts where cost is $40,000.00 or greater. Performance bonds are
              required for public work contracts where cost is $20,000 or greater.
              Specific requirements shall be set by Mayor and Council for the City.


B. DISQUALIFIED CONTRACTORS

Any contractor to which one of the following applies will be considered disqualified
from doing business with the City of Norcross:

       1. Any contractor currently in material default or in liquidated damages on
          another City contract.

       2. Any contractor (including any owner, officer, director or key employee)
          who has been convicted in the last 5 years of any crime involving bid
          rigging, kick-backs or similar conduct.

       3. Any contractor that is currently in litigation with the City regarding a City
          contract.

       4. Any contractor that has previously performed unsatisfactory work on
          another City contract and for which the City has written documentation to
          that effect.

CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES

C. CHANGE ORDERS

It is the policy of the City to minimize change orders on contracts. However, the
City realizes that at times circumstances may dictate that changes be made to the
scope of a project. In these cases, the following policies will be followed prior to
proceeding:

<5% of the total contract or <$2,000 (whichever is less) ­ The Department
may approve the change orders but must notify Mayor and Council in writing
prior to work/services proceeding with approval.

>5% of the total contract or >$2,000 (whichever is less) ­ The change order
must be approved by formal action of the Mayor and Council.

The above parameters apply in the aggregate and not by each change order.
These policies should be followed within each bracket until the aggregate amount
reaches the next bracket. At that point in time, the policy for the next bracket
would be followed by City staff. Prior to completion of a contract, all change
orders not having received specific City Council approval should be bundled into
one change order and placed on the City Council's agenda for ratification. The
Department Director will be responsible for processing the necessary documents
(agenda item, memorandums, and documentation) to accomplish final ratification
of remaining change orders.

Addition by Council action 8/2/04:
All Change orders that are in excess of $10,000.00 and either:
1. greater than 50% of the original contract price, or
2. outside the scope of the original contract, must be re-bid in accordance
   with the City of Norcross Purchasing Policies in effect at the time, unless
   otherwise approved by the Mayor and City Council.


D. COMPETITIVE SEALED BIDDING

       1. Acquisitions $10,000.00 or More
          Any purchase or service which is expected to cost $10,000.00 or
          more shall be acquired through the competitive sealed bid process
          except as otherwise provided in these policies.

       2. Dissemination of Invitations to Bid
          Public notice of an Invitation to Bid shall be advertised as required by
          Georgia law. The public notice shall contain a general description of
          the item to be purchased, shall state the location where documents may
          be obtained and the date, time and place of bid opening. Notice of any
          of advertisement identified as likely to result in optional competition
          may be used in addition to required advertisement.

CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES
       3. Receipt of Bids
          No bid shall be eligible for consideration by the City unless it is placed
          in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the City by
          the date and time as specified in the Request for Bids. All bids are to
          be stamped with the date and time of receipt and secured until the
          designated opening time. A bid delivered late shall under no
          circumstances be eligible for consideration by the City. Bids shall be
          returned unopened to the bidder.

       4. Bid Opening
          Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses
          on the date and at the time and place designed in the Request for Bids.
          The name of        each bidder, the purchase price contained in each
          bid, and such other information as the City deems appropriate shall be
          announced as the bids are opened. A record of bid information shall
          be recorded and available for public Inspection.

       5. Modification of Bids
          Any clerical mistake which is patently obvious on the face of a bid
          may, subject to the limitations described below, be corrected upon
          written request and verification submitted by the Offer. A non-
          material omission in a bid may be corrected if the City determined the
          correction to be in the City's best interests. Omissions affecting or
          relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not
          be corrected after bid opening:

                              a. Price information, and
                              b. Any required insurance.

        6. Withdrawal of Bids
           Bids may be withdrawn at any time prior to the bid opening. After
           bids have been publicly opened, withdrawal of bid shall be based
           upon the following:

              The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to
              withdraw his bid due to an error within two business days after
              the conclusion of the bid opening procedure. Bids may be with-
              drawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower
              than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the
              bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical
              mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due



                                    32
CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES
                to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission
                of a quality of work, labor or material made directly in the com-
                pilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or
                unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence
                drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and
                materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be
                withdrawn. The bidder's original work papers shall be the sole
                acceptable evidence of error and mistake if he elects to withdraw
                his bid. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision,
                the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low
                bid.

      7. Bid Evaluation
         Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the
         Invitation to Bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not
         specifically set forth in the solicitation.

      8. Bid Cancellation
         An Invitation for Bids may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all
         bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the
         solicitation where it is in the best interest of the City in accordance with
         regulations promulgated by the City, or as a result of improper conduct on
         the part of a City employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be
         made part of the bid file.

      9. Bid Award
         a. Responsive and Responsible Bidder(s)
                Subject to approval by the Mayor and City Council, bids
                shall be awarded to the responsible bidder(s) who have
                submitted the lowest cost responsive bid(s).

         b. Approval of Bids
               All bid awards for amounts of $10,000.00 or greater shall
               be approved or rejected by the Mayor and City Council.

         c. Rejection of Bids
                The City reserved the right to reject any or all bids if it
                determines such rejection to be in the best interest of the
                City.

CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES
            d. Disqualification of Bids
                   The following types of bids shall be disqualified for consideration
                   for a bid award:
                    A bid which is incomplete in any material aspect,
                    A bid submitted without required bonds or insurance, and
                    A bid submitted by a company on the Disqualified Bidder List.

            e. Tie Bids
               In the event two (2) responsive bids are tied for the lowest price
               and the other terms and conditions of the two (2) bids are substantially
               the same, the bid shall be awarded to the Norcross City bidder if only
               one of the bidders has its principal lace of business in Norcross. If both
               or neither of the tied bidders has its principal place of business in
               Norcross, then the bid award shall be made to the winner of a coin toss
               by the Council in a public session where bidders and one or more
               witness may be present.


  E. COMPETITIVE SEALED PROPOSALS

  The Competitive Sealed proposal method of bidding will be used for professional
  services. Services will include, but are not limited to, architectural, engineering,
  planning, consulting, legal, medical, surveying, auditing, and banking services.
  When City staff determines that it is neither practical nor advantageous to the City to
  procure specific types of supplies, services or construction by competitive sealed
  bidding, the sealed proposal method will be utilized.

  Competitive sealed proposals are received by a stated time and place. There is no
  public opening and the proposals are not read aloud. The proposal price is kept
  confidential until an award is made by the City Council. Discussion is allowed after
  proposals have been opened to allow clarification and changes in proposals provided
  adequate precautions are taken to treat each offer fairly and to ensure that information
  gleaned from competing proposals is not disclosed to other offerors.

  In an effort to keep the professional services fees in line with the budgeted amount,
  the following statement may be included in the RFP for professional Services. "All
  bids shall be submitted in a lump sum amount.                 No bid in excess of
  $___________will be accepted."

  For construction projects the capped amount is ____% of the estimated construction
  amount. Although the basic fee is based in part upon the estimated construction cost,
  the bidder should not anticipate that the amount of the fee will automatically increase
  in the event that the actual construction cost exceeds the estimated cost. Any fee
  adjustments shall be based solely upon approved changes in the scope of service. The

                                            34
  CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES

  "not to exceed" amount is determined by the cost of the construction of the project.
  This allows the City of Norcross to place a "cap" on the amount that will be paid for
  these services. There may be cases where the percentage paid may be adjusted up or
  down according to the complexity of the project being bid.

  The Professional Services RFP will request that the proposal price be submitted in a
  separate sealed envelope within the proposal package envelope. This allows the
  proposals submitted to be reviewed and a consensus arrived on the most qualified
  firm(s) according to the firm's qualifications, previous related work experience and
  their understanding of the project.

F. COMPETITIVE SEALED PROPOSALS
  Once a firm or firms have been "short listed," it may be necessary to call the firm(s)
  in for an interview to clarify any questions that the Mayor and Council may have
  regarding the project and their proposal.
  The firm which is the most qualified is determined and the proposal price envelope is
  opened for review. If there is more than one firm that is relatively as equally
  qualified as another or others, more than one envelope may be opened for review. It
  may be necessary to negotiate services and/or prices at this time in order to obtain the
  optimum benefits of the competitive solicitation.

  The process of negotiations will be conducted in accordance with ethical business
  standards and auction techniques shall be prohibited in discussions.                   A
  recommendation will then be made to the Mayor and Council as to the most qualified
  firm for the project. An agenda item and memorandum will be prepared by the user
  Department Head for submission to Mayor and Council. In the event that the
  recommended firm or vendor cannot meet the requirements of the contract or
  negotiations fail, staff will have authority to award the contract/bid to the second most
  qualified firm/vendor.


SECTION V. EMERGENCY PURCHASES

       A.    DURING WORK HOURS

             If an emergency occurs during normal business hours, the Department
             Head is to be contacted regarding an emergency Purchase Order. The
             below listed procedures should be followed:
                    Contact the Department Head to request that three (3) telephone
                    quotes be obtained (if over $2,500.00) and inform the Department
                    Head why the purchase is necessary. If the emergency purchase is
                    over $2,500.00 the Department Head will notify the Mayor and
                    Council to obtain their approval prior to proceeding.

                                                      35
CITY OF NORCROSS PURCHASING POLICIES
B.   BEFORE OR AFTER NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS

     Prior approval of emergency purchases should be obtained if at all
     possible. However, when there exists a threat to public health, welfare,
     safety, or property, before or after normal business hours, the below listed
     procedures should be followed:

     1. If the estimated amount of the expenditure is less than $2,500.00, the
        Department Head is authorized to make the necessary expenditure.

     2. If the estimated amount of the expenditure is above $2,500.00, the
        Department Head is authorized to make the necessary expenditure
        after a reasonable attempt is made to obtain three telephone quotes.
        The Department Head is responsible for making a written explanation
        of the emergency expenditure to the Mayor and Council the morning
        of the next working day. The explanation should include time, date,
        circumstances, and any prices obtained for comparison.

     3. If the estimated amount of the expenditure is $5,000.00 or more, the
        Department Head should contact the Mayor for approval before
        proceeding. If the Mayor cannot be contacted then the Mayor Pro
        Tem should be contacted for approval. The Department Head should
        contact the respective Council Committee Chairperson to inform
        him/her of the emergency situation. The Department Head and/or the
        Committee Chairperson will inform the other members of the
        respective committee of the emergency situation.

                 FIXED ASSET POLICIES



              CITY OF NORCROSS, GEORGIA
CITY OF NORCROSS FIXED ASSET POLICIES
SECTION I. GENERAL INFORMATION

A. CAPITALIZATION POLICY

Items which cost over $500 individually and possess a useful life of five years or more
may be capitalized on the City's financial statements and expensed through the capital
outlay general ledger account. For proprietary funds, a journal entry will be made at
year-end to reclassify the items from the capital outlay account to the respective fixed
asset category.

Certain assets which may be expendable and fall below the established monetary
threshold will be charged to an expense account other than the capital outlay account, i.e.
small equipment. However, an asset number may be assigned to these assets and others
only as deemed necessary by the Financial Services Department.

B. ASSET CATEGORIES/TYPES

Currently the City has the following categories for financial statement reporting
purposes:
                    Description
                    Land
                    Buildings
                    Building Improvements
                    Computers & Peripherals
                    Furniture & Fixtures
                    Machinery & Equipment
                    Vehicles
                    Utility Distribution Systems

C. TREATMENT OF LEASED ASSETS

The City capitalizes assets which are acquired under capital leases. The City does not
capitalize nor does it assign asset numbers to items which are acquired under operating
leases. See accounting pronouncements for the differentiation between capital and
operating leases.

D. DEPRECIATION

The City records depreciation for proprietary fund types monthly after the fixed assets are
reconciled for acquisitions, transfers, deletions and disposals at the end of the budget
year. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method with no estimated salvage
values used in the computation.




                                            38
CITY OF NORCROSS FIXED ASSET POLICIES

E. USEFUL LIVES

The following useful life guidelines exist in number of years:

               Description
               Land
               Buildings                              40
               Building Improvements                  40
               Computers & Peripherals                 5
               Furniture & Fixtures                  7-10
               Machinery & Equipment                 7-10
               Vehicles                                5
               Utility Distribution Systems           50

F. IMPROVEMENTS, ADDITIONS & REPAIRS

If a major repair extends the useful life of the asset, the cost will be added to the fixed
asset.

G. PHYSICAL INVENTORY

Once per budget year, an asset listing is sent to each Department Head to verify the
existence of the fixed assets. The department should make Financial Services aware of
any items which are located that do not appear on the asset listing. Any missing items are
investigated by staff with the assistance of the department. Significant unaccounted
losses of assets will be brought to the attention of the Financial Services Director for any
further actions. The Financial Services Department, with the cooperation of the
department, may make spot checks to verify the accuracy of inventory records.

H. GIFTS/DONATIONS

Gifts and donations are recorded at fair market value at the date of the gift.

I. INFRASTRUCTURE

The City does not capitalize items of infrastructure in governmental fund types such as
streets, sidewalks, curbs, etc. Infrastructure is capitalized and depreciated in enterprise
fund types, such as water lines and improvements. Capitalization of infrastructure will
follow      generally   accepted     accounting      policies   (GAAP)      and     GASB
pronouncements/guidelines.




                                              39
CITY OF NORCROSS FIXED ASSET POLICIES
J. TAGGING LOCATIONS

Specifically approved items determined in the budgetary process will be allowed to be
purchased through the capital outlay account. Purchase orders for items which have not
been specifically approved in the budgetary process will not be processed, regardless of
budget availability, without prior approval by the Mayor and Council. Each department
will enter the necessary fixed asset information, such as a detailed description of the asset
purchased, when submitted to accounts payable personnel. Asset numbers will be
assigned by Financial Services at the time the order is received. The asset tag and
inventory form will be sent to the appropriate department. The department is responsible
for providing the serial number when completing the inventory form. The department is
also responsible for tagging the fixed asset in the suggested locations according to the
tagging instructions which are provided in the policies. The tag should be located in an
easily readable position. The following are some suggestions for tag placement.

       *Machinery ­ The tag should be attached in a prominent eye-level position on
       the front of the machine yet where it will least likely be defaced in the normal
       course of operation.
       *Desks, tables, benches ­ Consistency is the key word when tagging these types
       of assets. In other words, each desk should be tagged in the same area. If tags are
       placed on the fronts or ends of desks, they may be obscured when two units are
       placed together. The tag should be placed where it can be verified without a
       major disruption to the employee's workday. Positions such as inside desk
       drawers (locked drawers can cause inventory problems) and inside legs of desk
       should be avoided. If the legs are removable, then apply the tag to the front rail of
       the desk or table.
       *Files, cabinets ­ The best location appears to be on the front upper left-hand
       corner. Here it will not interfere with locks, nor cover the manufacturer's name
       tag. Again, uniformity will facilitate periodic number checking.
       *Chairs ­ They may be tagged on the legs, but preferably the tag should be
       placed on the rear edge of the seat or the upper center of the back. The chair may
       have to be moved to conduct periodic checks, but normally these positions will
       not disrupt work.
       *Factory trucks, racks ­ Care should be taken to ensure that tags are not
       positioned where they may be removed easily or defaced by bumping, wearing or
       hard blows. The upper left-hand front corner is at eye level for racks are a good
       location.




                                                 40
CITY OF NORCROSS FIXED ASSET POLICIES
   SECTION II. TRANSFER OR DISPOSAL OF ASSETS

   The Fixed Asset Transfer Form should be forwarded to the Financial Services
   Department on a timely basis. Before the actual movement of an asset takes
   place, staff should be informed by properly completing the Fixed Asset Transfer
   Form when a transfer or disposition is requested.

   Disposal of assets to surplus is accomplished by filling out the Fixed Assets
   Transfer Form and denoting the "Transferred to Which Department' as Surplus."
   The form for releasing such surplus items is submitted to Financial Services.

   A department requesting the same item may use the same form with approval for
   request signed by the Director of the department to which the item is being
   transferred.

   It is important that the asset tag always remain affixed until the item is actually
   sold in a surplus sale. DO NOT REMOVE IF THE ITEM IS TO BE `SOLD IN
   SURPLUS SALE' OR `STORED.' Arrangements for the physical storage or
   surplus of items at a common facility may be handled through the City's Financial
   Services Department. Vehicle keys and tags should also be turned in to the
   Financial Services Department.

RE: Gateway Signage Budget Amendment Supplemental, Lighting Installation



Mr. Smith,

According to our lighting vendor we have the cost for the lighting installation to be added to the sign
contractor's cost of construction. The lighting will be using induction lighting technology which is
consistent with our current goals for City lighting. The total cost is $6,600.00 which includes both the
gateway sign at Holcomb Bridge Road and Peachtree Industrial and Holcomb Bridge Road and Buford
Highway. This cost also includes a 10% contingency cost.

Please do not hesitate to let me know if you have any questions.

                                           Project Description

Prior to the beginning of the year, the Nest was in desperate need of several repairs. The
restrooms in the Nest were in critical disrepair. The restroom areas in the Nest were filled
with mold, dry rot, and suffering long term damages from severe leaks. These damages also
bled into the walls in the kitchen area of the building. Heavy rains caused the roof structure
over the kitchen to collapse and leak. Additionally, the porch roofs required elastomeric
coating as well as fascia replacement. Upon further review and inspection we determined that
more than half of the roof structure was decayed and required attention. The decision was
made to handle this repair under emergency status. The repairs were necessary renovations
that were made in order to make the building suitable for upcoming Art shows and other
various events held by the City.

New Roof with Architectural Shingles                                                $9,970.00
Bathroom Renovations & Kitchen Walls                                                $6,625.00
Elastomeric Coating on Porch Roofs & Fascia Replacement                             $3,548.00

The total cost of repairs were $20,143.00

Staff Recommendation: Allocate funding for emergency repairs to the Nest.

Funding Source: To be Determined

Project Cost: $20,143.00

                                           Project Description

The air conditioning unit at the Lionheart Theatre has been failing for the last few months.
We have had several small repairs, however we discovered that an electrical issue was causing
the control boards to short out and burn out. Throughout the summer we have performed
several minor repairs. The outside unit was found to be low on Freon. After further research
and investigation, it was discovered that the outside unit has a major interior leak that cannot
be repaired. The Freon is leaking at a rate at which refilling only lasts up to three days. The
contractor has recommended replacing the outside unit as the most cost-effective and time-
sensitive solution. The air conditioning system will not function until repairs are made.

The cost of repairs and replacing the outside unit are $8,597.83



Staff Recommendation: Allocate funding for emergency repairs to the Air Conditioning System

Funding Source: To be Determined.

Project Cost: $8,597.83

RE:    Wingo Street LMIG sidewalk Project

Dear Mr. Smith:

Community Development has coordinated the design of a sidewalk connectivity project along
Wingo Street that provides pedestrians a safe route from the surrounding neighborhoods along
Wingo Street into the heart of Downtown Norcross. The intent of the project is to use LMIG
funding. Staff submitted the application for the project at a cost estimated at $102,088.07 and
we have received the money for the project minus 30% as the City's expected match. The
estimated cost of construction also included surveying and engineering of the sidewalk.

On Friday, October 11, 2013 the City received bids and the lowest bid was for $95,900.00. The
bids came in slightly higher than expected. As calculated below the lowest bid came in ~$12k
over expected.

Project Probable Cost of Design & Construction=                       $102,088.07

LMIG Funding to Norcross -30%                      $71,461.65
Survey =                                           $5,105.00
Engineering =                                      $13,780.00
Construction=                                      $95,900.00
Minus Total Funding=                               -$102,088.07
Project Over=                                      $12,696.93
The 30% match and $12k overage could be funded through remaining LMIG if available or
SPLOST.

Sincerely,

RE:    Proposal for Phase II Environmental Assessment
       Norcross Tucker Road 25-Acre Tract
       Norcross, Georgia
       Proposal No.: 2013.3912.02

Dear Mr. Mueller:

United Consulting appreciates the opportunity to continue to assist you with this project. This
proposal is based on the results of our recent Phase I Environmental Assessment. We understand
that future development plans may include an elevated walkway along portions of the project
site.


                                          BACKGROUND

The Project Site was formerly part of an Army gun range prior to 1921. United Consulting
reviewed a report from September 2009 that was prepared by Parsons, which covered much of
the Project Site property. Soil samples had detections of the metals antimony, copper and lead
above what Parsons considered to be background levels. These detected levels, however, were
below the notification concentrations for the constituents tested. Parsons report recommended the
finding of No Department of Defense Action Indicated (NDAI). According to the USACE
formerly Used Defense Site GIS website, there is additional work planned at the Camp Gordon
site; the website did not indicate what work was planned or whether the planned work was
associated with the Project Site or other Camp Gordon property.

United Consulting believes the former gun range operations at the Project Site represent an
historic recognized environmental condition (HREC) to the Project Site as the use represents the
possible release of metals to the soil. Given the limited number of soil samples (about four), and
the limited depth of sampling conducted at the Project Site, additional soil sampling for metals
would be prudent to verify that soil impacts are not present on the Project Site

                                    SCOPE OF WORK
1.     Soil samples will be obtained from the ground surface to depths of 36 inches below
       existing grade for total RCRA metals analyses. Borings will be located approximately
       every 100 feet along the southern portion of the western half of the project site, as this
       was the reported shooting bank. There will be a total of nine sampling locations. The
       final locations of the soil samples will be recorded using our global positioning
       equipment (GPS).

2.     We propose to collect three soil samples per boring. Borings will be advanced manually
       with a stainless steel hand auger. The sampling equipment will be properly cleaned
       between sampling locations to avoid cross-contamination. Soil samples will be assessed
       in the field visually and 27 soil samples will be designated for laboratory analysis.

3.     All soil testing will be conducted by a certified, qualified chemical testing laboratory. All
       samples obtained in the field will be preserved and transported to the laboratory within 16
       hours. Chain of Custody will be maintained and documented.

4.     Our Phase II Environmental Assessment report will provide the laboratory test results,
       comparison of the data with regulatory levels, our professional opinion as to whether the
       property is contaminated and comments pertinent to the project.


                                     COMPENSATION
Our compensation for conducting this Phase II Environmental Assessment will be $5,250.00.

RE:    North Norcross Tucker Property - Phase I Environmental Study

Dear Mr. Smith:

Community Development received the completed Phase I Environmental Report for the 4
parcels that are the subject of the agenda item. The report identified past activities and the
impacts these past activities have on the environment. According to the report, the City is not
taking liability of any existing conditions where the state or federal government would require
immediate mitigation. The study identifies risks to proposed development due to unsuitable
soil should development be proposed. It should be noted that a large majority of the site is
within flood hazard zones and / or stream buffers. Development would be precluded on the
buffer and flood issues alone without regard to the unsuitable soils. There is a small area (0.5 to
3/4 acres) adjacent to North Norcross Tucker Road that is above flood and outside of the
stream buffers that could be developed to current City development codes. The City could
propose the development of numerous passive uses that would not be prohibited based on the
current circumstances. For example, the City could develop walking / bike paths in accordance
to the adopted Parks and Greenspace Master Plan. The City could also take ownership of the
property and leave it in its current condition with no obligation of immediate mitigation if
nothing is proposed.

Sincerely,


Chris McCrary

Fantastic, Chris.   Thank you for emailing me.
 
Can you advise how this works with the land straddling incorporated and non-incorporated land?  
Would the city work with the county?
 
Also, can you advise the date for the next policy meeting?   If the donation is accepted, do you think
this would be in 2013 or would it more realistically be in 2014?
 
Just let me know a good time to talk and I can make it work.

  Amanda,

  My name is Chris McCrary and I'm the Director of Community Development here at
  Norcross. The Mayor asked me to contact you and let you know that I can place this on
  the next Policy meeting agenda. The five requests below can be part of that agenda item.
  What I would like to do is look this over and we can meet or at least have a phone
  conversation to see this move forward. I'm available for most of this week and we can set
  up a convenient time for us to talk.

  Thank you,

Gentlemen,

I am hoping you can perhaps help me...since going to the city is a bit easier than finding the correct
contact for the county, I am starting with you.

I own or control approximately 27 acres in Gwinnett County. Part of this land falls within the Norcross
City limits, some do not. Please see the attached.

The parcels are as follows:

        R6224A001 B, C and D (Margeson Properties, LLC)
        R6224 074 (currently in my father's name, but I am the executor of his estate)
You will see that this property fronts North Norcross Tucker Road and travels between Sheffield Forest,
and the Treebrook subdivision off Western Hills, ending behind Anamanda Close. (Yes, oddly, I'm the
Amanda of Anamanda... ). The parcels travels along a creek bed making much of the property flood
plain, but ideal for greenspace.

I am not a developer like my father was. As I'm relocating shortly, I need to make arrangements for this
land.

I would like to donate it to the city and/or county for a preserve, park, dog park, walking/running trail,
etc.

This supports Norcross' own Liveable Centers Initiative from 2008, that indicates a goal for this zone to
"insulate" the neighborhood from incompatible growth."

I have related requests:

       First, the land donation must be appraised as the expense of the city and/or county to ensure I
       have a fair and accurate valuation for tax purposes.
       Second, I would hope that this greenspace could be named for my father, Ted M. Margeson, who
       developed several subdivsions in Gwinnett and built over 300 homes there from 1979-1997.
       Third, the city/county must accept all four parcels.
       The land would remain greenspace/park/trail, etc. (In other words, it could not be zoned for
       commercial/residentail/industrial purposes.)
       Finally, time is of the essence. I wish to accomplish this donation before I move.

Can you advise on next steps...

Thank you for your consideration and assistance.

RE: Medlock Bridge Road ­Langford Road ­North Peachtree Street Intersection, Findings of Intersection
Analysis



Chris,

Kimley ­Horn was retained to conduct a traffic engineering analysis of the intersection incorporating the
proposed modification of the right turn lane from Medlock Bridge Road to North Peachtree Street. The
proposed modification was to remove the existing right turn lane from Medlock Bridge Road to North
Peachtree and replace it with a standard right turn lane controlled by the existing traffic signal. Under
this design, the right turn lane would be 80 feet in length. The finding of the intersection analysis is that
the right turn should be increased to 100 feet. Increasing the right turn lane to 100 feet will provide for
the appropriate storage for the PM peak traffic demand.

What is germane to this information is that the queuing of traffic on the through lanes of the Medlock
Bridge Road approach during the PM peak will extend to 350 feet, thereby effectively closing access off
to the right turn lane in either the existing condition or the proposed redesign. The implication is that
80 feet is adequate for the traffic conditions with the exception of the PM peak. However, because of
the extensive queuing of the adjacent through lane, the lane storage is not a limiting factor in the
intersection's capacity. Consequently, I would recommend moving forward with the right turn lane
length of 80 feet, thereby utilizing the existing condition without introducing more costly improvements
for the sake of an extra 20 feet of storage length.

Please do not hesitate to let me know if you have any questions.

Re:    Traffic Engineering Study
       Intersection of Medlock Bridge Road / Langford Road at N. Peachtree Street
       City of Norcross, Georgia

Dear Jeffrey:

Per your request, Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. has prepared this memorandum
summarizing the traffic engineering study for the intersection of Medlock Bridge Road /
Langford Road at N. Peachtree Street. The City of Norcross has proposed a geometric
improvement at this intersection. The improvement involves redesigning the southbound right-
turn movement (Medlock Bridge Road to N. Peachtree Street) from a channelized "straight"
right-turn with yield control, to a standard right-turn controlled by the existing traffic signal,
and would require vehicles to turn right onto N. Peachtree Street. This improvement is
displayed on the concept graphic in the Appendix. The purpose of this traffic engineering study
was to evaluate this proposed improvement by determining if the intersection will function at an
acceptable level-of-service with acceptable traffic operations based on existing traffic volumes.


Existing Traffic Conditions

Medlock Bridge Road / Langford Road is a 5-lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit
of 40 MPH. According to GDOT, Medlock Bridge Road (north of the study intersection) is an
urban minor arterial with a 2012 AADT of 14,050 vehicles per day, and Langford Road (east of
the study intersection) is an urban local road. N. Peachtree Street (south of the study
intersection) is a 2-lane urban minor arterial with a posted speed limit of 30 MPH and a 2012
AADT of 8,930 vehicles per day. For the purposes of this traffic engineering study, Medlock
Bridge Road / Langford Road is assumed to have a north-south orientation and N. Peachtree
Street is assumed to have an east-west orientation in the vicinity of the study intersection. An
aerial of the study intersection is shown on Figure 1.

Peak hour turning movement counts were performed on Wednesday, October 2, 2013 during the
AM, midday (MD), and PM peak periods to quantify the existing peak hour conditions at the
study intersection. The raw peak hour turning movement counts are provided in the appendix.

Traffic Analysis

Level-of-service (LOS) determinations were made for the weekday AM, MD, and PM peak
hours using Synchro Professional, Version 8.0. The program uses methodologies contained in
the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual to determine the operating characteristics of an
intersection. LOS is used to describe the operating characteristics of a road segment or
intersection in relation to its capacity. LOS is defined as a qualitative measure that describes
operational conditions and motorists' perceptions of a traffic stream. The Highway Capacity
Manual defines six levels of service, LOS A through LOS F, with A being the best and F the
worst. Local and state agency review standards in the area typically require LOS D or better.

The study intersection was analyzed under existing year 2013 conditions, both with and without
pedestrian actuation of the proposed crosswalks. For the purposes of this traffic analysis, the
City improvement (reconfigure the southbound right-turn movement from a channelized
"straight" right-turn with yield control to a standard right-turn controlled by the existing traffic
signal) was assumed complete. The observed peak hour traffic volumes with the proposed
roadway geometry (intersection laneage) are shown in Figure 2. The results of the LOS
analysis are summarized in Table 1. Additionally, a queuing analysis was performed to
determine the effectiveness of the existing and proposed storage lanes, and its results are
summarized in Table 2.

From the results shown in Table 1 and Table 2, it can be seen that accounting for pedestrian
actuation of the proposed signalized crosswalks does not affect LOS, average vehicle delay, or
queuing. This is due to minimal to nonexistent pedestrian activity at the study intersection
noted from the existing peak hour turning movement counts. Additionally, the amount of time
assigned to each movement at this signalized intersection is sufficient to "cover" the pedestrian
walk time minimums, thus, a pedestrian actuation will not affect the signal's timing.

Based on the level-of-service analysis summarized in Table 1, the study intersection with the
City improvement is projected to operate at an acceptable LOS under existing year 2013
conditions during the AM, MD, and PM peak periods. For the queuing analysis summarized in
Table 2, the primary focus was on the southbound (SB) right turning movement, as this
represents the City improvement. For this movement, an estimated 80 feet of storage was
assumed to be constructed (using existing pavement only). Under existing year 2013 conditions
with the City improvement, queues for the SB right movement do not appear to be problematic
during the AM and MD peak periods. However, during the PM peak period, 95th percentile
queues are projected to exceed the 80 feet of available storage by approximately 15 feet under
existing year 2013 conditions with the City improvement.


Summary

A traffic engineering study for the intersection of Medlock Bridge Road / Langford Road at N.
Peachtree Street in the City of Norcross was performed to evaluate the proposed City
improvement, which is to redesign the southbound right-turn movement (Medlock Bridge Road
to N. Peachtree Street) from a channelized "straight" right-turn with yield control, to a standard
right-turn controlled by the existing traffic signal, requiring vehicles to turn right onto N.
Peachtree Street.

Pedestrian actuation did not have any effect on this analysis, since there are an insufficient
number of pedestrians and the amount of time assigned to each movement is sufficient to
"cover" the pedestrian walk times. The study intersection with the City improvement is
projected to operate at an acceptable level-of-service (LOS) during all three peak periods under
existing year 2013 conditions. Based on the Synchro queuing analysis, 95th percentile queues
for the new southbound right-turn movement are projected to exceed the assumed 80 feet of
available storage by approximately 15 feet during the PM peak period.

It should also be noted that according to the GDOT Regulations for Driveway and
Encroachment Control, the minimum right-turn deceleration lane length for a 40 MPH roadway
is 150 feet with a 50-foot taper.

Based on the existing year 2013 conditions and the results of this traffic engineering study,
Kimley-Horn recommends the following for the intersection of Medlock Bridge Road /
Langford Road at N. Peachtree Street:
     ·     Remove the southbound channelized "straight" right-turn lane.
     ·     Remove the channelizing island for the existing southbound right-turn movement.
     ·     Install a southbound right-turn lane, to be controlled by the signal, with a minimum of
           100 feet of storage and a 50-foot taper.
     ·     Provide crosswalks and pedestrian signal equipment across the eastbound approach and
           northbound approach.

Replacement Item                      New Item

Project Description:
Replace dead/dying trees in Lillian Webb Park, Downtown area, and Thrasher Park.




Project Justification:
A significant number of trees in Lillian Webb Park need replacing. The trees were installed in the heat of summer
during a period of drought, followed by several more years of drought, resulting in extreme stress from which they
have not recovered. In the downtown area and Thrasher Park, many of the trees are reaching the end of their natural
lifespan. (In the downtown area we have replaced approximately 12 trees in the past 6 years; similarly, several trees
have died and been replaced in Thrasher Park.) Also included are funds to install trees behind the new pergolas in
Lillian Webb Park to compliment the existing trees around the splash pad and provide additional shade for the
pergolas. Lastly, this request includes dollars for tree removal/stump grinding, liriope and seasonal color replacement
where necesary, mulch, tree mini lights removal/rewrap, and repair of electric/Muzak in downtown tree beds. See
attachment for details.

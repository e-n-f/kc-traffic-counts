The following agenda items were discussed:

IV.      2013-2017 Capital Improvement Plan - Information Only

         Jeff Johnson gave an overview of the proposed capital improvement projects for the 2013 and 2014. Jeff
         indicated that of the projects planned for the 2013 and 2014, the most challenging projects will be the
         Lime Township Annexation for 2013 and the two planned roundabouts along T.H. 22 at the intersections
         of Adams Street and Madison Avenue for 2014. It was then opened up to open discussion about any other
         project that was not directly discussed.

         Tom had some general questions pertaining to the City's aging system of streets and utilities. Mark Knoff
         explained to the committee how the City has been correcting the aging systems and some new
         technologies that are out there to verify and test the existing utilities prior to just removing them and
         replacing based on age.

V.       Non-Motorized

         Richard Kier discussed some general statements about the City and the MPO and wanted to verify that the
         County was going to continue the bike lane along the new section of Stadium Road in respect to the
         CSAH 60/82 and Victory Drive. It was noted that the city would contact the County.

VI.      Streets/Traffic

         A. Echo Street Parking - Install No Parking along the West side of Echo Street from Marsh
            street to the north.

              Landon Bode presented to the committee the proposal to install No Parking along Echo Street
              and the discussions from the neighborhood meeting that was held October 25, 2012. It was
              then opened up to general discussion where Bob Kreuzer explained to the committee the
              situation of the high parking demand by ISJ and the problems trying to navigate down Echo
              Street. A motion was made by Tamra with a second by Bautch to approve installation of No
                                              Unofficial until approved by City Council

        B. 5th Avenue - Install No Parking along 5th Avenue from Pine Street to a point 230' west

             Landon presented to the committee the proposal to install No Parking along 5th Avenue from
             Pine Street to a point 230' west due to the street width restrictions. A motion was made by
             Tom, with a second by Tamra to approve the installation of No Parking from Pine Street to a
             point 230' west. The motion carried 5-0

        C. 5th Avenue - Install Yield Sign along 5th Avenue at the intersection of Pine Street

             Landon presented to the committee the proposal to install a yield sign along 5th Avenue at
             the intersection of Pine Street due to recent street realignments. A motion was made by Tom,
             with a second by Bautch to approve the installation a yield sign on 5th Avenue at the Pine
             Street intersection. The motion carried 5-0

VII. and VIII. Transit and Airport

        A. 2013-2017 Airport and Transit Capital Improvement Plan- Information Only

             Mark Knoff discussed various projects within the airport area which ranged from pavement
             rehab, hanger repair and security fence improvements as well as many more. He discussed
             how these projects get funded as well as some changes if the city becomes a MPO.

             Transit CIP included the purchase of two class 700 buses to replace current buses that are
             high maintenance and at there end of useful life.

IX.     Rail - No Report

Agenda Item: Advocacy Role of the Greater Mankato Bike/Walk Advocates

Recommendation/Action(s): Discussion only

Summary:
 Cities throughout the Minnesota and the USA are providing their residents and visitors
 with the opportunity to bicycle or walk for exercise and transportation. Young and elder
 people are choosing to live in cities offering those choices. A recent report on NPR
 discussed how young people are choosing where they want to live before seeking a job
 and many are selecting active, livable communities.

Greater Mankato recently was recognized as a Bronze level Bike Friendly Community.
To move forward towards Silver and Gold, improvements need to be implemented. The
Greater Mankato Convention and Visitors Bureau will soon introduce a new brand for the
area featuring the areas great bicycling. However, for residents and visitors to repeatedly
ride their bike in the area, they need to be safe, be able to easily find their way and have
a pleasant experience. Now is the time to move Greater Mankato ahead. We believe
Greater Mankato to be the type of city that can attract people to visit by implementing the
attached recommendations starting in 2013.

Recommendations include the following: creating a bike advisory committee, way finding
signage, designation of on street bike routes, connectivity of routes, warning signs,
education, continued bicycle parking installations and monitoring of bicycle traffic counts.

Greater Mankato Bike and Pedestrian Improvement Recommendations

         Greater Mankato Bicycle Improvement Recommendations
                                  2013

The Greater Mankato Area needs a comprehensive Bicycle Plan with implementation
beginning in 2013. The plan should be developed together with city staff and bicyclists with
a vision, goals, timeline, benchmarks and projects. MATAPS is a start. But MATAPS needs
more detail and work. For example, it does not contain a timeline for improvements so
implementation has been slow. Greater Mankato Bike and Walk Advocates recommend
using a bicycle consultant to develop the most creative ways to design roads and streets for
safety and pleasure. Roads and streets should be designed to be safe not only for
accomplished cyclists who will bike in busy traffic but for the majority of people who would
bike if it were safe. The City of Minneapolis Bicycle Master Plan could serve as a template.
Ten of the projects to be included in a comprehensive plan are listed below.

   1. Create a bike advisory committee of city staff and bicyclists that meets regularly to
      plan and design bike improvements. Representatives from neighborhoods throughout
      the city should be asked to be on the committee. The Mankato Multi-Modal
      committee contains only one cyclist and does not function as a bike advisory
      committee similar to other communities such as Rochester. Consider combining a
      pedestrian advisory committee with bicycles or form a separate committee for
      pedestrians.
   2. Way-finding signs should be placed throughout Greater Mankato so residents and
      visitors alike can use multi-use trails and designated on-street routes easily. See the
      Washington DC way-finding plan that has been shared with both cities.
   3. Designate on-street bike routes with paint, signage and traffic barriers connecting
      neighborhoods to destinations such as schools, places of employment and shopping
      with as much safety and pleasure as streets allow throughout Greater Mankato.
   4. Complete and connect to each other existing multi-use trails such as Glenwood,
      Thompson Ravine, Riverfront, Red Jacket and Victory Drive. Repair Riverfront from
      Riverfront Park to the Water Plant including the blind corner and rocks along trail.
   5. Place signage along existing multi-use trails that cautioning motorists that bikes and
      pedestrians will be crossing the road. Glenwood's trail that crosses Division and
      others streets is a key example. Also work on bike and ped crossings on busy streets
      such as North Riverfront, Warren at the intersection with Glenwood, South Riverfront
      with Sibley.
   6. Veterans Bridge could be made safer for both bikes and pedestrians. The Franklin
      Ave. Bridge in Minneapolis is similar and could offer ideas for a low cost fix.
   7. Designate a staff position to be a part-time Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator for
      Greater Mankato.
   8. Develop an education initiative for cyclists and motorists so both can safely travel
      together. Use the police to inform drivers of proper and safe operation of both bikes
      and motorized vehicles.
   9. Continued installation of bicycle parking throughout the area.
   10. Begin bike traffic counts using volunteers so Mankato has a base data of how many
   people are cycling. MNDOT'S newest guidelines should be used when structuring bike
   counts.

    These recommendations are only a beginning towards Greater Mankato becoming a
community where residents and tourists who bike will be safe, have a fun and have a pleasant
experience they will want to repeat. The Greater Mankato Bike and Walk Advocates would be
very willing to assist staff from Greater Mankato to begin implementing improvements to our
bicycling infrastructure.

Agenda Item: Project Update on Adams Street between Hope Street and Victory Drive

Recommendation/Action(s): Information Only

Summary: Engineering and Community Development staff have been working with
land owners north of the Madison East Mall on a potential development project that may
go before the Council in the near future.

The 45.22 acre property proposed for platting as Kearney Addition currently consists as
a combination of agricultural use, a large regional drainage pond and treed ravines. The
property is bound by existing Hope Street and Primrose Subdivion to the west, Oak
Haven Subdivision and Thompson Ravine to the north, Victory Drive to the east, and
Madison East Center to the South.

Street access to the property can be obtained currently from Adams Street and
Goodyear Avenue on the west as well as the temporary road along the north property
line of Madison East Center. No street access currently exists to the north, nor along
Victory Drive. A 90-foot wide electric power conveyance easement exists along the
entire eastern boundary.

The current east-west temporary drive located near the southern boundary of the
property is substantially lower elevation-wise than the property immediately north of the
roadway. Temporary concrete traffic barriers have been placed as a separator between
the roadway and the parking lot for Madison East Center.

City watermain and sanitary sewer utilities are accessible at multiple locations around
the perimeter of the property. Drainage is currently handled by the large regional facility
in the center of the proposed plat, known as Kearney Pond (City of Mankato fee
ownership). Kearney Pond was originally constructed in 1972 as a part of the drainage
plan for The City of Mankato as identified in "The Drainage Plan" by Barr Engineering.
This pond was constructed to attenuate runoff flows from the Madison East Center as
well as future development within the Thompson Ravine System. Several drainage
easements currently encumber the property to facilitate storm water conveyance from
the surrounding area to Kearney Pond.

An offsite wetland investigation on the property (excepting the ravines) was performed
in August, 2012. A follow-up visit by the wetland specialist and Blue Earth County

      This report has been prepared at the request of the Kearney Grandchildren Limited
      Partnership for the construction of streets and utilities associated with the proposed
      Kearney Addition to the City of Mankato. Construction will consist of grading, sanitary
      sewer, watermain, drainage and street improvements along with erosion control and turf
      establishment.
      This report will discuss existing conditions of the area and make recommendations for
      the planned improvements. Figures and cost estimates for the improvements are included
      in the appendix to this report, along with an offsite (photo review) wetland investigation
      report.


II.   EXISTING CONDITIONS

      The 45.22 acre property proposed for platting as Kearney Addition currently consists as a
      combination of agricultural use, a large regional drainage pond and treed ravines. The
      property is bound by existing Hope Street and Primrose Subdivion to the west, Oak
      Haven Subdivision and Thompson Ravine to the north, Victory Drive to the east, and
      Madison East Center to the South.
      Street access to the property can be obtained currently from Adams Street and Goodyear
      Drive on the west as well as the temporary road along the north property line of Madison
      East Center. No street access currently exists to the north, nor along Victory Drive. A 90-
      foot wide electric power conveyance easement exists along the entire eastern boundary.
      The current east-west temporary drive located near the southern boundary of the property
      is substantially lower elevation-wise than the property immediately north of the roadway.
      Temporary concrete traffic barriers have been placed as a separator between the roadway
      and the parking lot for Madison East Center.
      City watermain and sanitary sewer utilities are accessible at multiple locations around the
      perimeter of the property. Drainage is currently handled by the large regional facility in
      the center of the proposed plat, known as Kearney Pond (City of Mankato fee
      ownership). Kearney Pond was originally constructed in 1972 as a part of the drainage
      plan for The City of Mankato as identified in "The Drainage Plan" by Barr Engineering.
      This pond was constructed to attenuate runoff flows from the Madison East Center as
      well as future development within the Thompson Ravine System. Several drainage
      easements currently encumber the property to facilitate storm water conveyance from the
      surrounding area to Kearney Pond.
      An offsite wetland investigation on the property (excepting the ravines) was performed in
      August, 2012. A follow-up visit by the wetland specialist and Blue Earth County
      Environmental Services (LGU) has since occurred; results are still pending. The initial
      report is included in the appendix for reference.

                                                                           Final October 24, 2012
III.   PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS

       The street and utility improvements described below will be constructed by securing a
       general contractor through a competitive bidding process. Figure 1 in the appendix
       illustrates the planned improvements.

       A.     Street Improvements

              Adams Street is part of the City's designated MSA system. It is proposed as a 40-
              foot wide, bituminous pavement roadway with B618 concrete curb and gutter and
              concrete walk on both sides. Hope Street, Patriot Drive and Dublin Road are all
              proposed as bituminous pavement roadways with 32-foot widths, B618 concrete
              curb and gutter, and concrete walk on one side. The pavement sections will
              consist of materials as shown on Figure 2 in the appendix. Note these sections are
              based on previously constructed streets on assumed similar soil types; no soil
              borings have been performed to confirm the section. It is recommended that a
              traffic study analyzing the anticipated traffic generated from the proposed land
              uses be conducted to verify appropriate street design variables such as width,
              section, lanes, etc. Recommendations for modifications to the existing signal at
              Adams Street and Victory Drive may also result.

              Hope Street will extend from Adams Street to Goodyear Drive. The ravine at the
              east end of Goodyear Drive will require modification in the form of a
              reconstructed retaining structure to allow for the street connection. Patriot Drive
              will terminate in a cul-de-sac approximately 300 feet north of Dublin Road.
              Dublin Road will extend westward from Victory Drive and intersect with Patriot
              Drive. The intersection of Dublin Road and Victory Drive will be a right-in /
              right-out (RI/RO) configuration due to access control in the form of a concrete
              median on Victory Drive.

              The Adams Street connection, while platted as part of Kearney Addition, will be
              designed and constructed by the City of Mankato. The subdivider will be
              responsible for 100% of the costs associated with the watermain and sanitary
              sewer in Adams Street.

              Street tie-ins at Victory Drive and Hope Street are expected to match existing
              elevations. However, the majority of the grade of Adams Street will likely need to
              be elevated compared with mall parking lot to the south. While there may be
              intermediate high and/or low points on the alignment, it is anticipated that Adams
              Street will be approximately 3 - 4 feet higher as compared to the mid-point of the
              parcel currently. This will require much coordination with the City during final
              design to achieve a profile that accommodates to the extent possible existing
              improvements to the south, overall site grading material balance, and the
              elevation of the pond to perpetuate storage capacity.




                                                                                      M15.105605
                                                                            Final October 24, 2012
B.   Utility Improvements

     Eight-inch watermain will be looped through the subdivision from Victory Drive
     westward on Dublin Road, then southward along Patriot Drive. There, the
     watermain will tee into a new 8" loop connection on Adams Street from Hope
     Street to Victory Drive. Watermain will also loop on Hope Street from Adams
     Street to Goodyear Drive. A northward 8-inch extension in Patriot Drive from
     Dublin Road will service the cul-de-sac.

     Eight-inch sanitary sewer will extend west from Victory Drive on Dublin Road,
     southward along Patriot Drive to Adams Street. From there it will extend west on
     Adams Street to a point approximately 200 feet east of the intersection with Hope
     Street, as well as eastward to a point approximately 300 feet west of Victory
     Drive. A northward 8-inch extension in Patriot Drive from Dublin Road will
     service the cul-de-sac.

     With the exception of Lot 1, Block 1 which will receive 8-inch sanitary and
     watermain stubs, 6-inch water and sanitary end services will be stubbed to each
     platted lot in the subdivision.

     Stormwater ponding requirements for improvements on this site are
     accommodated by Kearney Pond. Storm sewer will be constructed along the
     alignments of each street and ultimately be routed to the reconfigured pond shown
     in the center of Figure 1. The reconfigured pipe network will involve cost sharing
     between the Owner and City of Mankato based on both existing and proposed
     alignments and drainage characteristics. A new pond outlet structure and pipe is
     proposed to convey water from the pond directly to Thompson Ravine.

C.   Grading and Turf Establishment

     The property will be mass graded as part of the construction project. Each lot will
     be general graded to provide for overland drainage to either a newly-constructed
     adjacent street and/or reconfigured Kearney Pond. Upon completion of the mass
     grading operation, a minimum of 6 inches of topsoil will be spread and the entire
     area will be seeded.

D.   Kearney Pond

     The original assumptions for the Kearney Pond watershed were for first tier lots
     along TH 14/60 to be Highway Commercial with the balance as Single Family
     Residential. The original drainage area for the pond was 175 acres with the
     assumption that 50% would be Single Family Residential, 35% Roadways and
     12% Highway Commercial. The original design called for 20 acre-feet of storage
     and a maximum discharge of 25 cubic feet per second (cfs).



                                                                             M15.105605
                                                                   Final October 24, 2012
             The drainage area has developed differently from the original assumptions
             resulting in the pond not performing as originally designed. Development has
             been more toward commercial and multi-family residential. Additionally, major
             roadways were further expanded within the watershed. The pond currently has
             18.5 acre-feet of storage and a maximum discharge of 100 cfs. This represents an
             obvious discrepancy in the operation of the pond. In order to restore the pond to
             its original design intent and provide for future development, the pond will need
             to be modified.

             Under the current land use plan, the 175 acre Kearney Pond watershed is
             substantially different than the original plan. The watershed is now planned to be
             50% Multi-Family Residential and Modern Commercial, 38% Roadways and
             12% Highway Commercial. At the proposed build out for the watershed, the
             reported pond storage needed is 44.4 acre-feet with a maximum discharge of 83
             cubic feet per second with a sustained maximum of 20 cubic feet per second.
             These requirements can be met by expanding the existing pond to attain the
             necessary parameters.

             It should be mentioned that various alternative drainage practices can be
             implemented in the build-out of the watershed to reduce the size of the regional
             pond and the amount of storm sewer that would need to be installed. Some of
             these alternate drainage practices could even receive a portion of the existing
             stormwater to further reduce the pond size. These practices vary in design,
             performance and cost, so no specific options are being proposed. However,
             consideration can be given to incorporating these methods into final design.

             In summary, it is recommended that the City performs modifications to the
             drainage system to improve its operation and reduce peak flows. Long term, the
             volume of detention within the drainage basin will need to be increased with the
             overall goals of reducing the flow rate and volume of water discharged to
             Thompson Ravine.


IV.   ESTIMATED COSTS
      Developing this substantial addition involves cost sharing from the City of Mankato.
      Exhibit 1 represents the cost participation between the Owner and the City (as suggested
      by the City) for the items of work described in this report - totaling nearly $4,325,000.
      Supporting detail for these costs is provided in the Exhibits 2 and 3. Actual costs will be
      determined through competitive bidding. The unit prices for each item of work are
      estimated based on similar previous projects and are subject to change. A 10%
      contingency factor has been included to account for unknown site conditions and for
      variances in unit prices. A 16% additive, as is common with any City project to account
      for engineering and administration costs, is also included.
      Exhibit 2 is the Preliminary Engineer's Estimate for all work understood to be the
      Owner's sole cost contribution. These items include site grading, Hope Street, Patriot
      Drive, Dublin Road, Adams Street (utilities) and storm sewer piping oversizing.

                                                                                      M15.105605
                                                                            Final October 24, 2012
       Exhibit 3 is the Preliminary Engineer's Estimate for construction items understood to be
       the City's responsibility for distributing costs and/or sole cost contribution. These include
       Adams Street (surface), Kearney Pond re-configuration and base storm sewer piping
       modifications.

V.     FUNDING AND ASSESSMENTS
       It is assumed that all non-City designed improvements would progress privately, yet be
       funded by the City through assessments levied against the property.
       Assessments for City-constructed items described in this report will be levied against the
       subdivider per the development agreement. For example, the subdivider will reportedly
       be assessed for the Adams Street street connection at the reconstruction rate, currently
       approximately $89 per lineal foot. A stormwater assessment is also anticipated as a result
       of the modifications to Kearney Pond and associated existing pipe network. It is expected
       this assessment would be levied apprpriately to all parcels receiving drainage benefit
       from the pond.


VI.    PROJECT SCHEDULE
       It is our understanding that Adams Street, Hope Street, Kearney Pond reconfiguration and
       associated storm sewer modifications, as well as any other underground utilities required
       would be in the initial phase. Subsequent phases would include the remaining
       infrastructure of Patriot Drive and Dublin Road.
       Platting and future infrastructure planning is proceeding with the anticipation that final
       design for the initial phase of the proposed improvements will take place this winter.
       Bidding and subsequent selection of a general contractor can then occur thereby allowing
       for an early spring 2013 construction start. With that, substantial completion of all street
       and utility improvements can be expected late summer to early fall of 2013. Final
       completion would be in the following construction season to allow for the placement of
       the final lift of bituminous pavement.

VII.   RECOMMENDATIONS
       Based on the findings presented in this report, the proposed improvements are feasible
       from the perspective of accepted engineering principles and construction procedures.
       The proposed project is cost effective and necessary to provide City utility and street
       infrastructure to the proposed lots in the subdivision. This is best accomplished through
       the competitive bidding process.

RE:    Wetland Investigation Offsite Determination (Photo Review)
       Kearney Propety
       Mankato, Minnesota
       BMI Job No. ­ M13.105489
Dear Anne:
Bolton & Menk was asked by the Kearney Granchildren's LP to review and investigate the
possibility of existing wetlands on property they own in Mankato, Minnesota. The area is
located to the north of the existing Madison East mall north parking lot, west of Hope Street
and east of Victory Drive in the hilltop area of central Mankato in Section 8, Township 108N,
Range 26W, Blue Earth County. The potential wetland review request came during an
abnormally dry period. Since the area in question is enrolled in agricultural production, it
was determined the best review method was through the review of the FSA aerial photos that
are typically flown in late June or early July
Prior to conducting the aerial photo review, Figures 1 through 5 (see Appendix) were
used to complete a preliminary evaluation.

       FIGURE 1:       Aerial Photo Location Map
       FIGURE 2:       Site Topography ­ U.S.G.S. Quadrangle Topography Map
       FIGURE 3:       National Wetlands Inventory Map
       FIGURE 4:       Minnesota Department of Natural Resources ­ Protected Waters
       FIGURE 5:       Blue Earth County Soil Survey map
       FIGURE 6:       Aerial Photo w/ LIDAR contours
       FIGURE 7:       Aerial Photo review results documentation

The data gathered during the preliminary investigation was used as described below:

FIGURE 1 is a high resolution aerial photo providing information regarding the present
use of the proposed development property along with its location. This figure also
shows the three areas of interest that had wet signatures in a few of the normal rainfall
years.

FIGURE 2 is a location map of the study area, using the U.S.G.S. quadrangle topography
map with a 10-foot contour interval. This map shows the general topography and helps
in determining the general drainage of the site and the surrounding areas. This
information is needed to evaluate the hydrology of the site and the adjacent areas.

FIGURE 3 is the National Wetlands Inventory map of the site and surrounding
properties. This information is used to complete a preliminary investigation of the
wetlands that may or may not exist on the site. This figure only identifies the centrally
located man-made stormwater pond as an existing wetland on the site.

FIGURE 4 is used to identify waters that would be regulated by the DNR. This exhibit
shows where DNR protected waters are relative to the investigation area. Thompson
Creek is located to the north of the study area.

FIGURE 5 is used to complete a preliminary investigation of the soils found on the
property. This is used to aid in determining the existence of soils that may be listed on
either the State or National hydric soils list. This figure shows that hydric soils are likely
to be present in the low areas of the site.

FIGURE 6 is the high resolution aerial photo including the LIDAR contours of the area.
This shows the topography of the site and helps determine the general drainage of the site
and the surrounding areas. This information is used to evaluate the hydrology of the site
and the adjacent contributing areas.

FIGURE 7 is used to document the results of the aerial photo review.

Three areas of interest were identified as possible farmed wetland areas (Figure 1) other than
the one obvious large area in the middle of the site that appears to have been manmade as a
possible stormwater pond between 1953 & 1973 thus making this area an incidental wetland.
On August 24, 2012 the available FSA aerial photos were reviewed for the areas containing
wetland signatures on the cropland portion of the study area. Photos from 1979 through 2011
(excluding 2001, 2007 & 2011 which were not available) were reviewed. Of these photos 15
years were determined to be normal precipitation years. Area 1 showed wet hits in 5 of the
15 years (33%) showing a wet signature through crop stress. Area 2 which is a waterway off
the northwest area of the stormwater pond showed crop stress, altered patterns or non-crop in
11 of 15 years (73%) showing this area warrants a field visit and probable wetland area.
Area 3 showed wet hits in 1 of the 15 years (6.67%) showing a wet signature through crop
stress.
A percentage of 50% is the usual cutoff requiring a field review for areas that are not
identified on the National Wetlands Inventory. Through this process, it was determined "no
existing wetlands" are present in Areas 1 & 3 (Figure 1), Area 2 (Figure 2) appears to have a
high probability of being a wetland area but a field visit would be needed to make an official
determination.

Agenda Item: Adams Street and Madison Avenue Intersection with T.H. 22 Update

Recommendation/Action(s): Information Only

Summary: At the request of the City of Mankato, the Minnesota Department of Transportation
(MnDOT), District 7, is investigating intersection improvements to the intersection of Trunk
Highway (TH) 22 and Adams Street. The purpose of this study is to determine the most
appropriate type of traffic control for the TH 22 and Adams Street intersection. MnDOT's
Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) process was used to investigate what type of traffic control
should be provided at this intersection.

In addition to the study intersection, this report will look at the effects of and recommend
improvements to the adjacent intersections on Adams Street to maintain mobility within the
transportation system.

There are improvements scheduled for 2014 to the south on TH 22 at the intersection with
County State Aid Highway (CSAH) 17/Madison Avenue and along the CSAH 17/Madison
Avenue corridor. These changes include the installation of a roundabout at the intersection of
TH 22 and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue. Once these improvements are made, the corridor will be
able to accommodate higher traffic volumes, which will increase the need for improvements at
this study intersection to maintain mobility.

In summary the recommended improvement are the following:

T.H. 22 and Adams Street Intersection
Through engineering judgment and discussions with MnDOT, Blue Earth County, and the City of
Mankato, a roundabout is recommended for the intersection of TH 22 and Adams Street for the
following reasons:
· The roundabout can be constructed within the existing right-of-way.
· The roundabout is expected to provide satisfactory traffic operations, improving the existing
conditions.
· The roundabout is expected to reduce the crash rate and severity rate at the intersection by
eliminating the potential for certain types of crashes and improving overall operations.
· The roundabout can be constructed to be more inviting to pedestrians by reducing the crossing
distances and exposure time to vehicles.
· The benefit-cost ratio is well above 1.0, suggesting significant value.

T.H. 22 and MadisonAvenue/CSAH 17 Intersection
The planned roundabout at the intersection of TH 22 and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue
could accommodate additional traffic from the implementation of access control at the
CSAH 17/ Madison Avenue and Haefner Drive intersection.

This section of roadway would benefit from implementation of a raised median (reducing private
driveway access) and a single-lane roundabout at the intersection of Adams Street and Haefner
Drive.

Adams Street and Sioux Road Intersection
The Adams Street and Sioux Road intersection and the Sioux Road intersection with the
mall access are too closely spaced to implement roundabout control.

Sioux Road Corridor between Adams and Madison Avenue
The Sioux Road corridor between Adams Street and Madison Avenue would benefit from
restriping to a three-lane facility. Traffic operations at the signalized intersection of Adams Street
and Sioux Road may benefit from this change, which will likely improve the recognition of lane
designations.

Raintree Road Corridor to north and south of Adams Street
The Raintree Road corridor to the north and south of Adams Street would benefit from restriping
to a three-lane facility. Traffic operations at the signalized intersection of Adams Street and
Raintree Road may benefit from this change, which will likely improve the recognition of lane
designations.

Purpose and Need
At the request of the City of Mankato, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT),
District 7, is investigating intersection improvements to the intersection of Trunk Highway
(TH) 22 and Adams Street. The purpose of this study is to determine the most appropriate type
of traffic control for the TH 22 and Adams Street intersection. MnDOT's Intersection Control
Evaluation (ICE) process was used to investigate what type of traffic control should be provided
at this intersection.

In addition to the study intersection, this report will look at the effects of and recommend
improvements to the adjacent intersections on Adams Street to maintain mobility within the
transportation system.

There are improvements scheduled for 2014 to the south on TH 22 at the intersection with
County State Aid Highway (CSAH) 17/Madison Avenue and along the CSAH 17/Madison
Avenue corridor. These changes include the installation of a roundabout at the intersection of
TH 22 and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue. Once these improvements are made, the corridor will be
able to accommodate higher traffic volumes, which will increase the need for improvements at
this study intersection to maintain mobility.


Description of Location
The intersection of TH 22 and Adams Street is located in the northeast region of the City of
Mankato and is currently under signalized control. The City of Mankato is located in central
southern Minnesota, in northern Blue Earth County. The U.S. Census Bureau 2010 population
estimate for the city is 34,509.

This intersection is located approximately 1/4 mile south of TH 14, a freeway, and approximately
1/4 mile north of CSAH 17/Madison Avenue, a minor arterial. The surrounding land use is
primarily commercial. Figure 1 provides a location map for the study intersection.

Traffic Volumes

Existing Traffic
Intersection evaluations typically focus on one or more peak hours. Occurring during an average
day, these peak hours represent the worst traffic conditions. By examining the peak hours,
traffic operations issues can be determined and solutions proposed. In this case, the p.m. peak
hour represents the worst hour of a typical day. The a.m. peak hour has much lower volumes,
as the surrounding retail and commercial developments do not open until later in the day.
Another peak hour exists over the lunch period, but the volumes are again lower than the p.m.
peak hour. Therefore, this study focuses on the p.m. peak hour.

Intersection turning movement counts for the study intersection of TH 22 at Adams Street were
collected on November 10, 2010, and presented in the April 2011 TH 22 at CSAH 17/Madison
Avenue ICE report.

To improve the computer modeling of intersection operations, the following additional
intersections were considered for this report:
    · TH 22 and the TH 14 eastbound exit/entrance ramps
    · TH 22 and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue
    · Adams Street and Haefner Drive
    · Adams Street and a private access intersection between TH 22 and Haefner Drive
    · Adams Street and Sioux Road
    · Adams Street and Raintree Road
    · Sioux Road and the internal mall access intersection north of Adams Street

The April 2011 ICE report also provided turning movement volumes for the intersection of TH 22
and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue. Video data collection on September 28, 2011, recorded turning
movement counts at the intersections of TH 22 and TH 14, Adams Street and Haefner Drive,
and Adams Street and Sioux Road. In early 2012, the City of Mankato obtained turning
movement counts at the remaining intersections. The detailed turning movement counts for
each intersection are provided in Appendix A.

Due to the different collection dates, the turning movements for adjacent intersections were
compared. Traffic volumes were adjusted to reflect the most current traffic volumes and
patterns. The adjustments tended to be minor in nature and generally reflect an increase from
the prior year count. The intersection volumes were then rounded and balanced to provide a
suitable base for capacity analyses and projected volumes. Figure 2 shows the p.m. peak hour
turning movements at the study intersection and surrounding auxiliary intersections for the year
2012. Figure 2 also shows the corresponding daily volumes.

Projected Traffic
Improvements to an intersection should address short-term and long-term traffic operation
issues. For this reason, traffic forecasts were determined for future year 2032 at each
intersection.

The April 2011 ICE report for the TH 22 and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue intersection also
developed year 2032 traffic volumes. Those forecasts were based on the Mankato Area
Transportation and Planning Study (MATAPS) forecasts for the area. The following paragraphs
are quoted directly from the April 2011 ICE report:

       "The MATAPS 2035 forecasts were completed for three different growth
       scenarios (low, medium, and high) and two different roadway configurations (no
       build network and baseline network).

       "Based on discussions with MnDOT, the 2035 baseline network would be the
       most representative network to use from the MATAPS. However, the low and
       medium growth forecasts did not seem to fully represent the expectations of the
       area. For TH 22, an average of the low and medium growth forecasts were used,
       which resulted in a 2% increase per year being used for TH 22. For the other
       roadways, the medium growth MATAPS forecasts were used, representing a
       0.9% growth per year. The only exception to this was the east leg of Madison
       Avenue (CSAH 17). With the large amount of undeveloped land along this
       corridor, it is anticipated that demands on this section of Madison Avenue will
       double in the next 20 years, so a growth rate of 3.5% per year was used for this
       roadway.

       "In order to forecast the peak hour volumes, a growth factor was determined for
       each intersection and its corresponding turning movements to and from TH 22
       and the local routes. A growth factor was obtained by applying the different
       growth rates for 22 years to account for the use of 2010 turning movements and
       a 2032 design year."

Thus, the April 2011 ICE report provided year 2032 forecasts for the TH 22 intersections with
Adams Street and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue. With that base, the forecasting method was
extended to the other intersections, and year 2032 projected turning movements were
established for all the intersections studied for this report.

MnDOT completed an additional review of the traffic forecast assumptions, reviewing the
current and past volumes on TH 22, CSAH 17/Madison Avenue, and Adams Street for the last
10 to 15 years. The review called into question the high growth rate of 3.5% per year for
20 years. While areas can experience and have experienced short periods of rapid traffic growth
(less than 10 years), growth generally levels off after that period. In addition, several factors
suggest that future growth in traffic may not be as robust due to:
    · The current socioeconomic issues
    · The aging baby boomer population
    · The younger generation's outlook on "greener" travel behavior

Instead, a growth rate of 2.0% per year was recommended for the areas east of TH 22. Given
the factors listed above, 2.0% per year is now considered aggressive.

The year 2032 traffic forecasts were revised for the new growth rate to the east of TH 22 and
rebalanced between intersections. Appendix A provides the original and revised turning
movement volumes for the year 2032. Figure 3 shows the revised year 2032 volumes for the
intersections and corridors.

In addition to the year 2032, an interim year of 2022 was established. This interim year allows
for additional operational analyses to determine potential short-term and long-term
improvements (if necessary). The year 2022 turning movement volumes are provided in
Appendix A.

Figure 3 shows the year 2022 projected daily volumes and projected turning movements for
each intersection. Figure 4 shows the same information for the year 2032.

Existing Conditions

Geometry
TH 22 is a north/south four-lane major arterial with a posted speed limit of 45 mph. TH 22 is the
main arterial on the east side of the city and contains the majority of the retail shopping centers.
This rural corridor has a wide median with trails on both sides. The TH 22 northbound and
southbound approaches each provide one left-turn lane, two through lanes, and one right-turn
lane.

Adams Street is an east/west four-lane collector with a posted speed limit of 30 mph. Adams
Street also serves the retail and commercial district. To the west of TH 22 is River Hills Mall and
other big box stores and restaurants. To the east of TH 22 are additional commercial
businesses. A sidewalk is provided on the north side of the road. The Adams Street eastbound
and westbound approaches each provide one left-turn lane, one through lane, and one right-
turn lane.

The intersection is currently under traffic signal control. Pedestrian crossings are marked in all
four quadrants.

Figure 5 shows the existing approach lanes and traffic control for the study intersection. This
figure also shows the same information for the surrounding intersections included in this
evaluation.

Warrant Analysis
The Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices outlines thresholds for when it may
be appropriate for a traffic control device to control traffic operations at an intersection. The
criteria, also called warrants, are applicable for all-way stop control and traffic signal control.
Generally, one or more warrants must be satisfied before all-way stop or traffic signal control is
considered, although meeting one or more warrants does not in itself require installation of a
traffic control device.

Currently, no warrants exist for the installation of roundabouts, which can be considered both a
traffic control device and a roadway feature. However, the ICE process, as detailed by MnDOT,
states that roundabouts are considered warranted if traffic volumes meet the criteria for either
all-way stop or traffic signal control.

For the warrant analysis, the major roadway is TH 22 and the minor roadway is Adams Street.
Two or more lanes are present for the major roadway and the minor roadway. A 70% reduction
in the warrant volume thresholds was used, as the major street's posted speed limit exceeds
40 mph. The right-turn volumes for each approach were removed due to the presence of right-
turn lanes and the allowance of right turn on red.

Based on the above assumptions and using the two hours of turning movement counts
available, the intersection of TH 22 and Adams Street satisfies the peak hour warrant. If more
hours of turning movement counts were used, the intersection would likely satisfy more
warrants. The full warrant analysis is provided in Appendix B.

Given that the intersection is currently under traffic signal control, the continued satisfaction of at
least one warrant justifies its use. As such, satisfying this warrant also suggests that roundabout
control is an option.

Crash History
Crash data from 2009 to 2011 for the intersection of TH 22 and Adams Street was obtained
from the MnDOT Crash Mapping Analysis Tool. Table 1 shows the recorded crashes at the
intersection by year and type of crash.

As shown, most of the crashes were rear end crashes, which is typical for traffic signals. In
addition, the majority of the crashes were property damage only (76%). A further review of the
crash data also revealed that 13 of the 63 (20%) occurred during the month of December. This
is likely attributable to the increase in traffic associated with the holiday season and the nearby
River Hills Mall.

Using the crash data with the intersection volumes, the crash and severity rates were
determined. Table 2 shows these rates in comparison with the Mankato District and state
averages for this type of intersection.

Table 2: Crash Rates ­ TH 22 and Adams Street
                                       Crash Rate                           Severity Rate
 TH 22 and Adams Street                   1.88                                  2.36
 Mankato District                         0.90                                  1.20

As shown, the crash history for the study intersection is well above what is normally expected
for this type of intersection. A review of the crash characteristics did not reveal any specific
crash pattern or trend.

Existing Operations
Traffic operations were analyzed using the VISSIM software package. This software provides
level of service (LOS), delay, and queues as measures of effectiveness. LOS is a qualitative
measurement presented in terms of LOS A through F. LOS A represents the best operations
with little to no delay, while LOS F represents the worst operations with excessive congestion.
Generally, an intersection LOS D is considered acceptable by most agencies. Delay and LOS
are directly related, although it should be noted that the relationship is different depending upon
whether the intersection is signalized or unsignalized. In general, the public tolerates longer
delays at signalized intersections resulting in a better LOS compared with a similar delay at an
unsignalized intersection. Queuing, or vehicle stacking, is important in determining if turn lanes
are an acceptable length and for determining potential impacts on adjacent intersections.

This p.m. peak hour analysis included the study intersection and all the adjacent intersections
as identified earlier. Table 3 shows the LOS results of the VISSIM analysis for each intersection.

As shown, each intersection is operating today with an acceptable LOS. A closer review of the
results showed individual movements at LOS D and long queue lengths that sometimes exceeded
the turn lane bay at the TH 22 intersections with Adams Street and CSAH 17/ Madison Avenue.

These results matched observations of the intersections. Although the LOS for each intersection
is acceptable, the TH 22 intersections with Adams Street and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue are
viewed by the public as having operational issues. This is likely due to the delays and queues
associated with the left-turn movements on TH 22 and side street movements. Although
technically acceptable, the results are lower than comparable intersections. Thus, the public
perceives operation issues due to higher delays at these intersections than normally
experienced on other corridors. In addition, the holiday season (roughly the month of
December) brings higher than normal traffic volumes to this commercial area and drivers who
may not normally use this intersection. These higher volumes decrease traffic operations during
this specific time, further reinforcing the perceived issues.

Appendix C includes the full results of the VISSIM analysis.

Analysis of Alternatives
Three alternatives were considered in this report for the study intersection of TH 22 and Adams
Street: No Build, Improved Signal, and Roundabout. The No Build Alternative would keep the
intersection the same without any infrastructure improvements. The Improved Signal Alternative
would provide dual left-turn lanes for every approach to improve capacity and safety. The
Roundabout Alternative would use a multi-lane roundabout to facilitate the safe movement of
traffic through the intersection.

Concept Layouts
Concept layouts for the Improved Signal and Roundabout Alternatives were developed to better
visualize the improvements and determine potential issues with their implementation. Figures 6
and 7 show the Improved Signal and Roundabout Alternative Concept Layouts, respectively.




                           Figure 6 ­ Signal Improvement Concept

                        Figure 7 ­ Roundabout Improvement Concept

As shown, most construction on the Improved Signal Alternative would occur on Adams Street
with some in the TH 22 median. However, to provide for the six lanes of traffic necessary (four
approach lanes and two exit lanes) as well as the raised median, additional right-of-way would
be necessary. With the close placement of the commercial development parking lots, obtaining
additional public right-of-way would be costly and would impact surrounding businesses. For
this reason, the Improved Signal Alternative was removed from consideration.

In comparison, the Roundabout Alternative would fit within the existing right-of-way and would
provide the multi-lane approaches and circulating and exiting lanes likely necessary for this type
of intersection. As shown, the Roundabout Alternative for the TH 22 and Adams Street
intersection is a viable option.

Only the No Build and Roundabout Alternatives were carried forward for additional analysis
following review of the concept layouts. Nontraditional intersections and a grade separation
were not considered feasible for this intersection.

Operations
VISSIM was again used to analyze traffic operations for the two viable alternatives. For each
alternative, traffic control at the TH 22 and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue intersection was changed
from a signal to a roundabout. Consistent with the April 2011 ICE report, construction of this
roundabout is expected in 2014.

Table 4 shows the results of the No Build Alternative for the existing, projected year 2022, and
projected year 2032 volumes.

As shown, the levels of service are generally acceptable even as they progressively worsen as
traffic increases over time. However, some individual movements at the intersection of TH 22
and Adams Street are expected to fall to LOS E beginning in year 2022. The eastbound and
westbound queues are also expected to greatly increase, which begins to have a slight effect on
operations at other intersections on Adams Street. The Adams Street intersections with the
private drive and Haefner Drive show signs of increasing delays, partially as a result of the
congestion at the TH 22 and Adams Street intersection.

For the Roundabout Alternative, an initial option, Option 1, was considered that would minimize
the number of lanes available as follows:
    · Two northbound approach lanes, one left/through and one through/right
    · Three southbound approach lanes, one left/through, one through, and one bypass right-
       turn lane
    · Two eastbound approach lanes, one left and one left/through/right
    · Two westbound approach lanes, one left/through and one bypass right-turn lane




                                         P a g e | 14
The TH 22 and Adams Street level of service results for the existing volumes and the projected
year 2022 volumes for Option 1 of the Roundabout Alternative are shown in Table 5.

The projected year 2032 volumes were not analyzed for this option, as poor results were already
being exhibited in year 2022. As shown, LOS D is expected for the eastbound approach. Although
technically acceptable, the results and long queues show that the roundabout is close to capacity
and would be expected to exceed capacity well before year 2032.

The Roundabout Alternative was then reanalyzed assuming a different configuration, Option 2,
which includes:
   · Three northbound approach lanes, one left/through, one through, and one bypass right-
       turn lane
   · Three southbound approach lanes, one left/through, one through, and one bypass right-
       turn lane
   · Two eastbound approach lanes, one left and one left/through/right
   · Two westbound approach lanes, one left/through and one free right-turn lane

Table 6 shows the TH 22 and Adams Street level of service results for the existing volumes and
the projected years' volumes for Option 2 of the Roundabout Alternative.

As shown, Option 2 of the Roundabout Alternative is expected to have satisfactory results for
years 2012 and 2022. The eastbound approach is expected to exceed capacity under this
option in year 2032, suggesting that additional improvements are necessary.

Given that the Option 2 configuration is expected to provide satisfactory traffic operations for
more than 10 years, Option 3 only considered additions to Option 2 that could be implemented
as some point in the future. In this case, right-of-way was not considered a constraint, as
negotiations could begin now for purchasing the right-of-way and dealing with potential impacts.
Option 3 would provide an eastbound free right-turn lane onto TH 22. Table 7 shows the TH 22
and Adams Street level of service results with projected year 2032 volumes under Option 3.

As shown, Option 3 of the Roundabout Alternative is expected to have satisfactory results for
year 2032, although some individual turning movements are at LOS E. The queuing for the


                                          P a g e | 15
intersection is also expected to increase at this time, potentially affecting the adjacent private
access intersections on Adams Street.

Based on the results of the VISSIM analysis, Roundabout Alternative Option 2 is preferred for
initial construction. Roundabout Alternative Option 3 is expected to be needed for the year 2032.
Using a straight-line projection of traffic growth and traffic operation results, Option 3 is expected
to be needed by year 2028. Having determined the appropriate configuration for the Roundabout
Alternative, Table 8 shows the LOS results for all the intersections evaluated in this report.

As shown, the improvement in operations at the TH 22 and Adams Street intersection would
result in slightly worse operations at the TH 22 and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue intersection
under the Roundabout Alternative. Under the No Build Alternative, expected congestion at the
TH 22 and Adams Street intersection would prevent all the demand traffic from reaching the
TH 22 and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue intersection. It is also important to note that the expected
average intersection delays for the year 2032 under the Roundabout Alternative are
approximately half of those expected under the No Build Alternative for the TH 22 and Adams
Street intersection. In addition, these results are for the p.m. peak hour only. Results for other
peak periods or non-peak periods would be expected to show even greater improvements in
traffic operations compared with traffic signal control under the No Build Alternative. The full
results for each alternative and option are provided in Appendix C.

Based on the VISSIM analysis results, the Roundabout Alternative is preferred over the No
Build Alternative in regard to traffic operations.

Safety Analysis
A safety analysis generally consists of examining existing and potential future crashes at an
intersection. The crash history for the TH 22 and Adams Street intersection from 2009 to 2011
was examined earlier and showed that the crash and severity rates are not in line with the
Mankato District and statewide averages for this type of intersection.

Average crash rates for roundabouts, either at a District or statewide level, are not yet available,
as roundabouts are still a relatively new traffic control device. However, the National
Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) report provides intersection level crash
prediction models based on data from across the country. The NCHRP report provides formulas
for multi-lane roundabouts with two circulating lanes that closely represent the Roundabout
Alternative for the study intersection.

The expected number of crashes per intersection control type were predicted using the existing
and projected traffic for this study intersection with the existing crash data, the average crash
rates, and the roundabout crash prediction models from the NCHRP report, as detailed in
Table 9.

  Crash projections using the existing TH 22 and Adams Street intersection rates.
2
  Crash projections using the average intersection rates of a Mankato District high-speed, high-
volume signalized intersection.
3
  Crash projections using the NCHRP multi-lane roundabout models with two circulating lanes.

As shown in the table, the Roundabout Alternative is expected to have the fewest number of
total crashes, even compared with the average intersection rates for the Mankato District.
Property damage crashes are expected to be higher for the Roundabout Alternative compared
with an average signalized intersection in the Mankato District. However, the fewer injury
crashes expected would compensate for that increase.

Roundabouts use physical geometry to reduce vehicle speeds, as opposed to other types of
control that primarily rely on signs. In addition, the central island and circular travel pattern of
roundabouts virtually eliminate right-angle and left-turn head on crashes, which is currently
approximately 15% of the current crashes at TH 22 and Adams Street intersection.

Based on the expected reduction in crashes, in comparison with both the existing crash rates
and the Mankato District averages, the Roundabout Alternative is preferred in terms of safety.




                                             P a g e | 17
Pedestrian and Bicycle Considerations
As mentioned earlier, trails are provided on either side of TH 22 and a sidewalk is provided on
the north side of Adams Street. Pedestrian crossings are marked on all four quadrants of the
existing signalized intersection. Although only a few pedestrians were recorded during the
turning movements or observed during site visits, the availability of these facilities suggest that
pedestrians or bicyclists can easily travel between various commercial developments around
the area.

Under the No Build Alternative, these crossings would remain and pedestrians or bicyclists
would have positive guidance as to when they have the right-of-way to cross. Using the timing
guidelines from MnDOT would ensure sufficient time to cross the full distance. While this
positive guidance is beneficial to pedestrians and bicyclists who use the crossings, they would
still have multiple lanes of traffic to cross with traffic approaching from multiple directions. Thus,
pedestrians and bicyclists would have a significant time of exposure to vehicular traffic.

Under the Roundabout Alternative, positive guidance would not be provided. Instead,
pedestrians or bicyclists would be expected to wait for gaps in traffic or for drivers to recognize
and stop for them. However, crossings in a roundabout are set back from the circulating lanes,
allowing drivers to focus on the pedestrians or bicyclists before focusing on vehicular traffic in
the intersection. In addition, the physical design of a roundabout reduces vehicle speeds around
the intersection, improving the safety of the crossings. In comparison with the No Build
Alternative, pedestrians or bicyclists would cross fewer traffic lanes at one time, reducing their
exposure time. The locations of the crossings and the use of splitter islands would allow
pedestrians or bicyclists to focus on traffic from one direction only, further reducing vehicular
exposure and improving safety.

In comparison with each other, both the No Build and Roundabout Alternatives have positive
aspects in terms of pedestrians/bicyclists considerations. For this reason, either option is
acceptable.


Benefit-Cost Analysis
This section documents the methodology and results of a benefit-cost analysis for the TH 22
and Adams Street Roundabout Alternative developed for this ICE report. The analysis accounts
for the cost of the alternative and the incremental benefits over time in terms of travel time
savings (less intersection delay) and safety savings (fewer and/or less severe crashes). In this
analysis approach, any quantified benefits greater than or equal to the quantified costs (benefit-
cost ratio of 1.0 or greater) represents an economically viable project.

Methodology
The monetary benefit of the project is quantified in terms of reduced vehicle hours traveled
(VHT) or less delay at the intersection and the reduced number and severity of estimated
crashes over the analysis period between the existing conditions and the Roundabout
Alternative. The monetary costs include construction, right-of-way, and project delivery costs.
Remaining capital values of the roadway features at the end of the analysis period are also
subtracted from the total cost of the project.

The results of the analysis provide input for evaluating the overall benefit of the proposed
improvements to the intersection. Due to the planning level of detail in the calculations, the
exact number is not as important as the magnitude of the value, specifically, that the value is
greater or less than one.


                                             P a g e | 18
The general assumptions for this analysis included:
   · The concept cost estimate developed for the intersection of TH 22 and Adams Street is
      for the study intersection only and does not include any improvements to the
      surrounding roadways or intersections.
   · All monetary values were discounted to the 2012 analysis year, which is the base year of
      study for this report.
   · The 20-year benefit period was based on a 2012 opening through year 2032,
      corresponding to the analyses contained in this report.
   · Yearly benefits were calculated on a linear interpolation over a 20-year analysis period
      from 2012 to 2032.
   · Increased delay and/or rerouting of trips during construction were not included.
   · Yearly maintenance and operating costs for each alternative were assumed to be
      approximately equal. This report assumes approximately $2,268 per year for a traffic
      signal (based on $1,500 per year for signal maintenance and operations, $480 per year
      for signal electrical power, and $288 per year for maintenance and electrical power for
      four luminaires). This report assumes approximately $2,448 per year for a roundabout
      (based on maintenance and electrical power for 12 luminaires). Due to this minimal
      yearly difference, maintenance and operating costs were not included in the analysis.
The MnDOT Office of Capital Programs and Performance Measures provided specific
assumptions in regard to standard values for this benefit-cost analysis. Table 2 in Appendix D of
this report shows those assumptions.
The traffic assumptions for this analysis included:
   · Daily VHT for the intersection (years 2012 and 2032 for the No Build and Roundabout
       Alternatives) was developed from the p.m. peak hour traffic operation models. See
       Appendix D for additional information on the development of the daily VHT.
   · The yearly crashes and crash rates for the No Build Alternative were calculated based on
       the existing crash history (2009 to 2011) for the intersection.
   · The yearly crashes and crash rates for the Roundabout Alternative were calculated
       based on formulas from the NCHRP.
Benefit-Cost Analyses Results
The following calculation tables, located in Appendix D, provide the details of the benefit-cost
analysis for the intersection of TH 22 and Adams Street:

   Table 5 ­ Vehicle Hours Traveled (VHT) Calculations
   Table 6 ­ Travel Time Benefits
   Table 7 ­ Crash Rates, Severity Rates, and Annual Crash Cost
   Table 8 ­ Crash Benefits
The cost estimate for the Roundabout Alternative is also provided in Appendix D.
As shown in Table 1 of Appendix D, the Roundabout Alternative has a benefit-cost ratio of 40.2.
The analysis indicates that the Roundabout Alternatives for the TH 22 and Adams Street
intersection has a benefit-cost ratio greater than one. As such, the alternative is expected to be
beneficial, with VHT and crash reduction benefits greater than the expected costs associated
with the alternative's construction.

Transportation System Considerations
The analysis of the preceding sections focused on the TH 22 and Adams Street intersection and
shows improved intersection operations under the Roundabout Alternative. However, this
alternative would also have impacts on the surrounding roadway network. This section
examines the potential impacts associated with the Roundabout Alternative.

TH 22 Corridor
In addition to the TH 22 and Adams Street intersection, the TH 22 corridor for this study
includes the intersections with the TH 14 eastbound exit and entrance ramps and
CSAH 17/Madison Avenue. The analyses presented earlier included the results of these TH 22
intersections and are summarized in Table 10.

As shown, the LOS for the TH 22 and TH 14 intersection increases slightly under the
Roundabout Alternative, although operations remain acceptable in either case. The Adams
Street intersection shows a large improvement under the Roundabout Alternative in terms of
decreased delay. The CSAH 17/Madison Avenue intersection shows an initial improvement with
the Roundabout Alternative; however in year 2032, the results are expected to be slightly worse
when compared with the No Build Alternative. Taken together, northbound and southbound
movements on TH 22 are expected to see less delay and shorter queues through the study
corridor. Thus, a positive impact for motorists on the TH 22 corridor is expected from the
construction of a roundabout at the intersection with Adams Street. The full results are provided
in Appendix C.

The nearby intersection of CSAH 17/Madison Avenue and Haefner Drive has also been
discussed by Blue Earth County in terms of its future control. Currently, this full-access
intersection provides side-street stop control on Haefner Drive, with CSAH 17/Madison Avenue
traffic able to proceed without stopping. Due to the high speed on CSAH 17/Madison Avenue,
the number of lanes to cross, and the close spacing of the intersection with TH 22, recent
discussion has focused on whether access control is needed. Access control would eliminate
some turning movements, reducing the conflict points in the intersection and improving safety.

The access control option most recently discussed is a 3/4-access intersection (which would
eliminate left-turn and through movements from Haefner Drive) with a J-turn to the east of the
intersection. The combination of the J-turn to the east and the new roundabout to the west would
allow the banned movements an easy option to reach their destination. Of the approximately
1,040 vehicles currently traveling through this intersection, approximately 270 would be affected
by this option. Of the affected vehicles, approximately 105 would be expected to become
westbound U-turn movements at the new TH 22 and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue roundabout.

The VISSIM analysis was re-run to analyze the intersection with this increased traffic. Table 11
shows the summary of the results with access control at the CSAH 17/Madison Avenue and
Haefner Drive intersection.

In a comparison of the two alternatives, the TH 22 intersections with eastbound TH 14 and
Adams Street remain approximately the same in terms of delay and LOS. With the additional
traffic volume, the TH 22 and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue intersection is expected to have an
increase in delay. However, the intersection is still expected to have satisfactory results,
suggesting that the new roundabout could accommodate access control at the intersection of
CSAH 17/Madison Avenue and Haefner Drive. The full results are provided in Appendix C.

Adams Street to the East
On Adams Street east of TH 22, two intersections were considered for this report: Haefner Drive
and the private driveways between TH 22 and Haefner Drive. Table 12 summarizes the results
of the No Build and Roundabout Alternatives.

As shown, the results under each alternative are relatively close, with the same level of service
result. Thus, traffic operations at these two intersections are not anticipated to be impacted by
the Roundabout Alternative.

However, the summary does not reveal that individual turning movements at each intersection
are expected to decrease to LOS E starting in year 2022 under either alternative. So, while the
existing intersection control is providing acceptable traffic control on average, individual
movements are exhibiting some issues.

To further investigate this section of Adams Street, the crash history for the years 2009 to 2011
was evaluated. For the section of roadway from the TH 22 intersection to east of the Haefner
Drive intersection, 16 crashes were recorded. Of those, 15 occurred at the Adams Street and



                                           P a g e | 21
Haefner Drive intersection. This is interesting, as the private driveway intersection between the
Adams Street intersections with TH 22 and Haefner Drive is perceived to be more of an issue.
Table 13 shows the crash history for Adams Street and Haefner Drive intersection.

As shown, right-angle crashes represent the majority (~40%) at this intersection. It is also
notable that four crashes (~27%) occurred during the holiday season in the month of December.
Using the crash data with the intersection volumes, the crash and severity rates were
determined. Table 14 shows these rates in comparison with the Mankato District and state
averages for this type of intersection.

As shown, the crash history for the study intersection is well above what is normally expected
for this type of intersection. Not enough crash characteristics were available to determine
potential safety trends or issues. Given the all-way stop control, failure to yield the right-of-way
or to stop, along with distracted driving, are the likely issues.
With some future capacity issues identified and a noticeably higher than average crash history,
improvements for this section of roadway were considered. The first step was examining the
traffic signal warrants. For the warrant analysis, the major roadway is Adams Street and the
minor roadway is Haefner Drive. Two lanes are present for the major roadway. For the minor
road, one lane of approach is provided. The right-turn volumes for each approach were reduced
by 50% to account for right-turn on red under traffic signal control.
Based on the above assumptions and using the 13 hours of turning movement counts available,
the intersection of Adams Street and Haefner Drive does not currently satisfy any traffic signal
warrants. The full warrant analysis is provided in Appendix B.
Failing to satisfy the traffic signal warrants suggest that traffic signal or roundabout control
should not be considered for this intersection (as mentioned earlier, traffic signal warrants are
often used to consider roundabout control). However, a roundabout can be considered both an
operational and a safety device. Therefore, roundabout control could still be considered as a
safety device due to the high crash and severity rates.
Assuming a single-lane roundabout at the Adams Street and Haefner Drive intersection, the
median could also be closed on Adams Street between TH 22 and Haefner Drive. The private
access driveways would become right in/out only in this scenario, with U-turns available at the
roundabouts on either side. These potential improvements are called Scenario 1 in this report
and are shown in Figure 8.

As shown, the Adams Street corridor to the east of TH 22 would generally improve under
Scenario 1. The exception is a slight decrease in average delay for the Adams Street and TH 22
intersection. The expectation of added traffic to this intersection from U-turning traffic explains
the difference. The full results are provided in Appendix C.

Using the existing and projected traffic for the Adams Street and Haefner Drive intersection with
the existing crash data, the average crash rates, and the roundabout crash prediction models
from the NCHRP yields the expected number of crashes per intersection control type, as
detailed in Table 16.

control intersection.
3
  Crash projections using the NCHRP single-lane roundabout models.

As shown in the table, Scenario 1 is expected to improve conditions compared with the existing
crash history, but not when compared with the average intersection rates for an all-way stop
controlled intersection. It should also be noted that the right-angle crashes recorded at the
intersection (~40% of the total) would be corrected under Scenario 1.

Beyond the capacity and safety factors discussed above, other considerations for the potential
Scenario 1 improvements include:
   · Increased storage for westbound Adams Street traffic approaching the TH 22
      intersection.
   · Reduced crossing distances and exposure time to vehicular traffic for pedestrians and
      bicyclists.
   · Increased distance to reach the crossing locations, potentially resulting in pedestrians
      crossing at unmarked locations.
   · Opportunity to considered striping changes to the east of the Haefner Drive intersection.
      Currently, the roadway provides two through lanes of travel in each direction. To better
      account for the private driveway accesses (current and future development), the
      roadway could be striped with one through lane in each direction and a center, two-way
      left-turn lane. The single through lanes would lead directly to and from the roundabout
      approach and exit lanes.

Based upon the expected positive impacts from the proposed improvements of Scenario 1, the
City is recommended to consider their implementation. The TH 22 and Adams Street proposed
roundabout should be designed to allow for these improvements either now or in the near
future.

Adams Street to the West
West of TH 22 on Adams Street, three intersections were considered for this report: Raintree
Road, Sioux Road, and the Sioux Road intersection with the mall access ring road. Given the
amount of traffic to and from the mall, these intersections seemed susceptible to potential
impacts from the Roundabout Alternative. Table 17 summarizes the results for these
intersections under each alternative.

As shown, implementation of the TH 22 and Adams Street Roundabout Alternative would result
in a slight improvement of traffic operations at the Adams Street intersections to the west. A
review of the queuing information also shows a decrease with the Roundabout Alternative.

To further investigate this section of Adams Street, the crash history for the years 2009 to 2011
was evaluated. A total of 31 crashes was recorded during this timeframe. Of those, 14 occurred
at the Adams Street and Raintree Road intersection and 16 occurred at the intersection with
Sioux Road. The remaining crash occurred at a private access driveway. Table 18 shows the
crash history for the Adam Street intersections with Raintree Road and Sioux Road.

As shown, right angle crashes represent the majority (~44%) of crashes at the Adams Street
and Raintree Road intersection. At the Adams Street and Sioux Road intersection, rear end
crashes occurred most (~ 38%). As with the previous intersections examined, most crashes in
this corridor occurred during the month of December (~27%), when traffic increases due to the
holiday season and the adjacent mall.

Using the crash data with the intersection volumes, the crash and severity rates were
determined. Table 19 shows these rates in comparison with the Mankato District and state
averages for this type of intersection.

The crash history for the intersections is above what is normally expected for this type of
intersection. Not enough crash characteristics were available to determine potential safety
trends or issues. Additional study of the intersections may reveal a specific issue to correct.

While capacity issues were determined not to be an issue, the higher than average crash history
provided justification for examining potential improvements. As the Adams Street intersections
are currently signalized, the traffic signal warrants were not evaluated. The existing traffic
signals allow for continued signalization of those intersections or the potential use of a
roundabout. Due to the close spacing of the Sioux Road/mall access intersection to the Adams
Street/Sioux Road intersection, a traffic signal was not considered for the Sioux Road/mall
access intersection, nor were the traffic signal warrants evaluated.

Scenario 2 provides potential options that focus on improving safety, as capacity is not
necessarily an issue. For the Adams Street and Sioux Road intersection, Scenario 2 examined
roundabout control. A single-lane roundabout would reduce crashes, allow for the expansion of
the Adams Street eastbound storage lanes at the TH 22 intersection, and allow for the restriping
of Sioux Road to a three-lane facility (one through lane in each direction with a center, two-way
left-turn lane). A roundabout was also examined in Scenario 2 for the Sioux Road and mall
access intersection. A roundabout at this location would better match with the potential new
roundabout at Adams Street and Sioux Road and would allow mall personnel to implement
specific holiday travel pattern restrictions more easily, such as prohibiting northbound left turns.
Figure 9 shows the potential improvements of Scenario 2.




                                           P a g e | 26
                         Figure 9 ­ Scenario 2 Improvement Concept

Although a roundabout could be considered at the intersection of Adams Street and Raintree
Road, this type of traffic control would not provide any secondary benefits to the area, as would
the other two proposed roundabouts. Instead, restriping of Raintree Road to a three-lane facility
was examined. This striping change would match the existing Raintree Road striping north of
the study area, match the existing approach lanes at the intersection with Adams Street, and
reduce the Raintree Road exit from Adams Street to one lane. Although the crash
characteristics for this intersection were not sufficient to determine the impact of Raintree
Road's two exit lanes on crashes, the possibility exists for confusion on these lanes. For
instance, a northbound through motorist could accidently be trapped in the left-turn lane without
realizing it and proceed with the through movement when a southbound left-turning motorist
would expect the northbound vehicle to turn. The three-lane facility would be safer for turns into
development driveways along Raintree Road.

Using the Scenario 2 improvements, traffic operations were reanalyzed with VISSIM. Table 20
shows the results of the analysis.

The analysis shows that delays and levels of service for the Adams Street intersections with
TH 22 and Raintree Road would remain about the same under either alternative. The Adams
Street and Sioux Road intersection and the Sioux Road intersection with the mall access are
expected to have lower delays and improved LOS under Scenario 2. While the results are
initially positive, a closer look at the queuing reveals potential issues. Northbound and
southbound queuing on Sioux Road between the Adams Street and the mall access
intersections is expected to be longer than the available storage distance. This suggests that
vehicles could stack within the roundabout circulating lane. While this impact does not appear to
significantly impact the delay and level of service results, vehicle stacking within a roundabout
could have other negative impacts. Thus, the potential safety improvement gained from the
roundabout could be lost by the operational queuing issue. The full results are provided in
Appendix C.

Having identified a potential issue with roundabouts, the Sioux Road intersections do not appear
to be a good fit for their installation.

As mentioned, restriping Raintree Road to a three-lane facility is also a component of
Scenario 2. The results summary in Table 20 showed similar delays and levels of service for
this option compared with the existing configuration. Although quantifying the exact potential for
safety improvements with this option is difficult, the crash rate and severity rate are expected to
decrease as lane assignments become more clear. In addition, the three-lane facility would
better allow for left turns into the development driveways off Raintree Road.

Sioux Road could also be restriped to a three-lane facility to better accommodate the
development driveways between the Adams Street and Madison Avenue intersections. The
restriping is not expected to have any impact on the Adams Street intersection or the proposed
roundabout at the TH 22 and Adams Street intersection. Traffic operations on Sioux Road could
improve with this lane configuration, improving overall safety in the area.

Recommended Alternative
Based upon the analysis and results presented in this report, the following conclusions are
drawn in regard to the TH 22 and Adams Street intersection:
   · Traffic operations at the existing signalized intersection exhibit high delays and long
       queues for some individual movements. As traffic increases, the delays and queues are
       expected to become more unacceptable, driving the need for improvements.
   · Improved traffic signal operations via dual left-turn lanes on every approach are not an
       option due to the limited right-of-way and improbable outlook for acquiring the necessary
       space.
   · Nontraditional intersections and a grade separation are not considered feasible.
   · Roundabout traffic control is a viable option that would improve traffic operations and
       safety now and into the future as traffic volumes increase.
   · The Roundabout Alternative would limit pedestrian/bicycle crossings to two lanes, a
       shorter crossing distance than the existing condition that would compensate for loss of
       the positive guidance provided by the existing traffic signal.
   · Using a concept layout and cost estimate, a benefit-cost ratio of 40.2 was determined.
       This high ratio suggests significantly more benefit than cost of implementing the
       Roundabout Alternative.
   · The Roundabout Alternative would operate acceptably with the planned roundabout at
       the TH 22 and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue intersection and is not expected to impact
       traffic operations at the intersection of TH 22 and the TH 14 eastbound ramps.
   · The Roundabout Alternative would allow for changes to the Adams Street corridor to
       improve safety and operations.

Through engineering judgment and discussions with MnDOT, Blue Earth County, and the City of
Mankato, a roundabout is recommended for the intersection of TH 22 and Adams Street for the
following reasons:
     · The roundabout can be constructed within the existing right-of-way.
     · The roundabout is expected to provide satisfactory traffic operations, improving the
        existing conditions.
     · The roundabout is expected to reduce the crash rate and severity rate at the intersection
        by eliminating the potential for certain types of crashes and improving overall operations.
     · The roundabout can be constructed to be more inviting to pedestrians by reducing the
        crossing distances and exposure time to vehicles.
     · The benefit-cost ratio is well above 1.0, suggesting significant value.

As the intersection design of the proposed roundabout is refined and updated, some elements
may be modified from what is shown in this report. It is anticipated that any changes would not
impact the results or the conclusions of this analysis.

Additional evaluation and analysis contained in this document also resulted in the following
conclusions:
   · The planned roundabout at the intersection of TH 22 and CSAH 17/Madison Avenue
       could accommodate additional traffic from the implementation of access control at the
       CSAH 17/ Madison Avenue and Haefner Drive intersection.
   · The Adams Street corridor to the east of the TH 22 intersection would benefit from
       implementation of a raised median (reducing private driveway access) and a single-lane
       roundabout at the intersection of Adams Street and Haefner Drive.
   · The Adams Street and Sioux Road intersection and the Sioux Road intersection with the
       mall access are too closely spaced to implement roundabout control.


                                           P a g e | 29
·   The Sioux Road corridor between Adams Street and Madison Avenue would benefit
    from restriping to a three-lane facility. Traffic operations at the signalized intersection of
    Adams Street and Sioux Road may benefit from this change, which will likely improve
    the recognition of lane designations.
·   The Raintree Road corridor to the north and south of Adams Street would benefit from
    restriping to a three-lane facility. Traffic operations at the signalized intersection of
    Adams Street and Raintree Road may benefit from this change, which will likely improve
    the recognition of lane designations.

        Notes:    Daily VHT data developed from the PM Peak Hour VISSIM analyses. An 
                  hourly percent of ADT breakdown was determined for a typical 24hour day. 
                  The hourly percent of ADT data was used to group the hourly volumes into 
                  three 8hour categories: high, medium, and low. Each category was assigned 
                  an hourly demand volume based on a percentage of the PM peak hour 
                  volume. 100% demand was assigned to the high category, 60% demand was 
                  assigned to the medium category, and 15% demand was assigned to the low 
                  category. A VISSIM analysis was completed for each demand category to 
                  determine an hourly VHT. To create a VHT for each individual hour of the 
                  day, the demand category VHT was adjusted based on a ratio of individual 
                  hour percentage of ADT to the highest hourly percentages of ADT for its 
                  category. The individual hourly VHT was then summed to determine a daily 
                  VHT.

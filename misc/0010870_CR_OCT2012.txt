PLANNING & BACKGROUND DATA
Project Justification Statement:
        The City of Alpharetta receives persistent complaints about the traffic operations of the
intersection at SR 9 and Vaughn Drive. According to the citizens, a traffic control signal is needed.
However, the traffic demands do not currently meet warrants for signal control measures. PI#721780-
which will eventually widen and reconstruct SR 9 in this area will not be constructed until 2020. This
project is an immediate solution that will address the traffic operational issues at the intersection of SR
9 and Vaughn Drive.
        The existing conditions at the beginning of the project consist of two travel lanes on the north
side, and one travel lane and one auxiliary lane on the south side with a striped median in between. At
the end of the project the existing conditions consist of one travel lane on the north side, and one travel
lane and one auxiliary lane on the south side.
        Currently, left turns from SR 9 northbound on to Vaughn Drive, and southbound on to
Winthrope Park Drive frequently interrupt the flow of vehicles traveling along SR 9. City staff reviewed
the intersection for traffic operation improvements and determined that minor widening and modifying
the existing channelization to incorporate a dedicated left-turn lane would both improve the traffic
operation of the intersection and reduce overall delay at the intersection.
        Within the existing right of way, the City proposes to do minor widening and restriping to
convert approximately 1800' of right turn lane into a thru lane and provide a two way left turn lane. This
would allow the area surrounding the intersection of Main Street (SR 9) and Vaughn Drive to be
reconfigured to meet commuter's current needs. The addition of left turn lanes on Main Street at both
Winthrope Park Drive and Vaughn Drive, and the dual left turn lane in-between, will help relieve
congestion on Main Street and decrease the amount of crashes caused by motorist being rear ended.
The existing right turn lane on the north side of SR 9 to the west of Vaughn Drive would remain in place.

Description of the proposed project: This quick operational improvement project lies completely
within the City of Alpharetta in Fulton County. The project proposed to improve the intersection of Main
Street at Vaughn Drive from Winthrope Park Drive intersection at Main Street to approximately 250'
northeast of the intersection of Main Street and Winthrope Chase Drive. The proposed project length is
approximately 0.25 miles.

*Is this project on a designated bike route?       No            YES
SR 9/North Main Street from Academy Street to Windward Parkway is on the Fulton County
Bike/Pedestrian Plan (1995) page 7.

*Is this project located on a pedestrian plan?     No            YES
SR 9/North Main Street from Academy Street to Windward Parkway is on the Fulton County
Bike/Pedestrian Plan (1995) page 7.

Is this project located on or part of a transit network?     No               YES
Marta Route 185 ­ Alpharetta/Holcomb Bridge Road

*Note: Due to the project length only being approximately 0.25 miles along SR 9 it does not seem
practical to install bike lanes along this project. The more reasonable alternative is to wait until future
projects which will widen SR 9 from Upper Hembree Road to Windward Parkway (GDOT PI# 721790- &
721780-) to occur and install a substantial bike lane route at that time.

CONTEXT SENSITIVE SOLUTIONS
Issues of Concern: Existing frontage is a mix of unimproved shoulders, and upgraded shoulders,
including curb and gutter and sidewalk. Some businesses have driveway openings wider than state
standards. Vehicles pulling in and out of these driveways conflict with pedestrians on the sidewalk as
well as through vehicles on Main Street. This results in a condition that is undesirable for pedestrians
and vehicles.

Context Sensitive Solutions: This project plans to match the existing improvements along the shoulder
of SR 9 by installing new curb and gutter, a landscape strip, and new sidewalk creating a consistent
shoulder along the entire project. Furthermore, this project intends to reduce the width of driveway
openings to a reasonable size, reduce the conflict points, thus creating a desirable corridor for
pedestrian, with consideration for businesses' access and parking.

DESIGN AND STRUCTURAL DATA
*Mainline Design Features: 3 lane urban section, including eleven foot travel lanes and a 14 foot flush
median. Urban 12 foot shoulder with 24" curb and gutter and 5' sidewalk.

*Note: The existing curb and gutter is 24" with no noticeable existing flood condition. This project
proposed to match the existing 24" curb and gutter due to right-of-way restrictions.

ALTERNATIVES DISCUSSION

Alternative selection:

Preferred Alternative: Minor widening of SR 9, and modification of existing channelization to incorporate
a dedicated left-turn lane onto Winthrope Park Drive and Vaughn Drive.
   Estimated Property Impacts: 0                           Estimated Total Cost:                 $609,140.68
          Estimated ROW Cost: 0                              Estimated CST Time:                    9 Months
Rationale: The preferred alternative will address the traffic operations issues that occur at the intersection
of SR 9 and Vaughn Drive, will reduce pedestrian conflicts in the surrounding areas, and will greatly
increase aesthetics along the entire project. This project is a quick operational improvement project, and
roundabout design was not considered during the selection of the project by the Traffic Operational
Committee.

No-Build Alternative: No improvements at this time. Improvements to the area would be delayed until
2020 for GDOT open year.
   Estimated Property Impacts: 0                             Estimated Total Cost:                            0
          Estimated ROW Cost: 0                               Estimated CST Time:                             0
Rationale: This alternative will not help address the traffic operations issues that occur at the intersection
of SR 9 and Vaughn Drive.

MEETING MINUTES:

*Action items in BOLD*

PFA was signed 6/4/12. Project is 100% reimbursable up to $550,000 and local government is responsible beyond this
amount.

A concept report is required, but the normal sequence does not necessarily have to be followed. Peter will handle any
requests for design exceptions/design variances internally to make sure we avoid needing them. Environmental can still be
ongoing, even as plans progress through final design. A PFPR is likely required, but the FFPR may end up being an email
review, with no meeting required.

Environmental document may be a PCE, but changes to parcel access may trigger a CE. It is desired to keep as a PCE.
Pond & Alpharetta to coordinate a right of way agreement with the pawn shop/beauty shop/tire shop before moving
forward with environmental. Alpharetta to consider flush sidewalk or alternate designs to try to ensure no access
changes.




                                                                  Meeting Minutes                                  Sheet 1 of 2

Vicki recommends public outreach on this project. City will consider options, including mailout and discussion during a
regularly scheduled public meeting time, since this project may not warrant its own.

It was noted that there are strict new air & noise requirements for environmental documentation. Existing traffic is very
important for this, and the city can provide counts as needed.

A pavement design will be required.

Pond to compare the proposed lane configuration of this project with the ultimate 5-lane section. This may be shown to the
public.

Assuming no R/W, this project is likely to let in FY13.

Pond to submit PFPR plans using the FFPR checklist, to ensure plans are well-advanced, and remain ahead of schedule.

Peter to provide Pond with a detailed task list for Pond to add exact dates to the proposed project schedule.

Pond to update the schedule to give more time for PFPR scheduling and review comments, as well as potential
public outreach.

Known threats to schedule and costs:
       R/W ­ If there is R/W, it will add several months to the schedule
       CE ­ If a CE is required, and not a PCE, it will slow the environmental documentation, and possibly impact the final
       schedule
       Stream impacts ­ There was discussion of a stream in the area. If impacted, it will slow the environmental
       documentation, and possibly impact the final schedule
       Utility relocations ­ Pond to look at utilities more closely, and consider all options to avoid impacts to utilities.

SUBJECT:        Projects STP00-0114-01(085) & STP00-0114-01(084), Fulton County, Summary
                of Comments Received During the Public Comment Period ­ The proposed
                project consists of the widening and reconstruction of SR 9, reconfiguration of
                side roads, pedestrian improvements and signal upgrades.


COMMENT TOTALS:


A total of 73 people attended the public information open house held for the subject project on
February 16, 2010. Displays, project handout materials, and comments forms available at the
meeting.


From those attending, 19 comment forms, 0 letters, and 1 verbal statement were received. An
additional 75 comments were received during the comment period, which was extended from
10 days to 14 days following the public information open house, for a total of 95 comments.
They are summarized as follows:


      No. Opposed             No. In Support         Uncommitted              Conditional

MAJOR CONCERNS:

Written concerns expressed opposition to the raised median, or lack of median break, in front
of the Manning Ridge and Winthrop Park subdivisions; concern that the proposed widening
would adversely affect the character and business economy of downtown Alpharetta; and
many suggested that the money would be better spent on completing Westside Parkway as an
alternative to SR 9.

Subsequent to the PIOH, on March 8, 2010, the City of Alpharetta conducted a forum to
discuss the proposed project. According to city records, a total 222 people were in attendance
and 65 people left comments. A total of 15 comments indicated support for the project as
currently proposed, 44 comments indicated opposition to the project, 1 comment was neutral,
and 5 comments indicated support for the project as "maybe".


In additon, a petition was submitted with 195 signatures with the following statements:


"The Georgia Department of Tranposrtation Has a Plan For Highway 9 in Alpharetta That Will
Adversely Affect Your Business and Property.
   · Plan to install a median that will limit left truns and require right turn in and right turn out
      for most buisnesses.
   · Plan to widen the highway increasing the speed of traffic through the city.
   · Plan will make the highway look like Windward parkway passing through downtown.
   · Plan will destroy the proposed vission of a quaint pedestrain friendly downtown
      Alpharetta."

Lastly, a second petition was submitted with 125 signatures with the following statements:

"The Georgia Department of Transportation is proposing road widening which includes a raised
median which would prevent making left hand turns into and out of Willis Chiropractic Center
and all business from Upper Hembree Road to Windward Parkway, as part of GDOT Projects
STP00-0114-01(085) and STP00-0114-01(084). I DO NOT SUPPORT RAISED MEDIANS in
this project and request that GDOT employ the use of a turn lane, like the one currently
available to drivers on North Main Street from Mayfield Road to Canton Street."

Attached is a complete transcript of the comments received during the comment period and a
copy of the public information open house handout for review. Your input on the proposed
responses is required by April 16, 2010. Please direct your comments via email to Edwards-

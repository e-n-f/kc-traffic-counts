Village of East Dundee                                          Dundee Crossings Transit and Redevelopment Study 

 
Since  the  recommendations  indicated  in  this  report  involve  a  variety  of  public  investments  and  actions, 
this  document  is  intended  as  a  concise  reference  source.  The  intent  is  to  provide  East  Dundee 
stakeholders  and  decision  makers  with  a    guide  that  will    focus  the  Village's  land  use/development 
policies  and  incentives  to  encourage  private  sector  initiatives.  As  noted  in  the  Implementation  Matrix, 
there  are    a  number  of  recommendations  for  specific  sites  and  projects  that,  taken  together,  are 
intended  to  develop  Dundee  Crossings  into  a  mixed  use  corridor  ­  creating  a  new  environment 
providing employment, services and tax revenues for East Dundee.  
 
East  Dundee  is  located  in  a  highgrowth  region  in  suburban  Kane  County  along  the  I90  Corridor.  Routes 
72 and  25 are  key  arterial  routes,  and  access  to  I90  is  relatively  close,  all  of  which  make  the  area  highly 
accessible  to  adjacent  communities  and  the  larger  region.  Multiple  bus  routes  also  converge  in  the  area 
and the Village of East Dundee is serviced by two Metra commuter rail lines.  
 
These  factors  suggested  high  potential  for  a  transitorientated  development  concept  at  Dundee 
Crossings.  The  approach  to  this  plan  considered  drivers  for  transit  services  and  physical  development, 
including  the  location  of  a  transit  center  at  Dundee  Crossings  and  land  use  and  economic  development 
planning for potential redevelopment sites.     
 
Another  key  strategic  benefit  of  Dundee  Crossings'  location  is  that  it  is  a  part  of  the  O'Hare  Business 
Corridor, proximate to the Northwest Tollway and situated within Kane County, which provides a lower
cost  environment  to  both  land  and  business  owners.   The  lower  costs  of  owning  property  and  operating 
a  business  will  be  a  key  competitive  advantage  going  forward  in  an  environment  where  businesses  are 
seeking every opportunity  to lower costs while being accessible to employees, clients and key modes of 
transportation.  
 
The  planning  process  included  background  analysis  of  existing  conditions  and  the  development  of  a 
preferred concept plan and design guidelines based on input received from the Steering Committee and 
public  participation.  A  series  of  tasks,  each  of  which  generated  information  critical  to  determining  the 
highest  and  best  use  of  properties  with  the  study  area,  were  completed  during  this  process.  The 
chapters  of  this  report  contain  full  copies  of  the  Consultant  Team  reports  under  each  task.    A  summary 
of these tasks, as well as their key outcomes and findings,  is listed below.  
 
Key Findings and Recommendations 
 
The key findings and recommendations of the Dundee Crossings Plan are: 
 
    ¾ The  redevelopment  of  Dundee  Crossings  will  provide  a  strategic  asset  for  the  economic 
        development goals of East Dundee.  To implement the Dundee Crossings Preferred Concept Plan 
        and  Design  Guidelines,  the  Village  will  need  to  create  the  appropriate  regulatory  framework, 
        including  required  zoning  changes,  prioritizing  the  use  of  TIF  and  BDD  proceeds,  and  proactively 
        communicating policies for partnering with the Village. 
         
    ¾ Dundee Crossings holds several locational advantages, including access to I90 and its position at 
        the  Kane/Cook  County  boarder.  However,  in  light  of  the  current  economic  environment,  the 
        Village  will  need  to  monitor  market  conditions  and  maintain  active  communication  with  area

       businesses,  land  owners,  and  developers  to  direct  regional  growth  opportunities  to  Dundee 
       Crossings as they occur.  
        
     ¾ The  Village  should  be  prepared  to  facilitate  partnerships  to  accomplish  the  goals  of  this  Plan. 
       These  partnerships  may  include  privateprivate  partnerships  between  existing  landowners  and 
       potential  new  businesses;  publicprivate  partnerships  between  the  Village  and  private 
       landowners, businesses, and developers; and publicpublic partnerships between the Village and 
       other potential institutional users of the Cook County site.    
  
     ¾ While  current  ridership  demand  and  the  location  of  existing  transit  centers  limit  current 
       potential  for  a  transit  center  at  Dundee  Crossings,  the  Village  will  need  to  coordinate  adequate 
       transit  service  levels  and  amenities  with  Pace  to  make  the  area  attractive  to  both  current  and 
       future  users.  Developing  an  overall  area  that  is  easy  to  navigate,  offers  multimodal 
       transportation  options  that  are  responsive  to  demand,  and  is  pedestrianfriendly  will  create  a 
       significant  competitive  advantage  for  attracting  new  businesses,  residences,  and  private 
       investment at Dundee Crossings.  
 
Summary of Individual Tasks and Associated Reports 
 
Task 1: Data Collection and Review 
 
The  Consultant  Team  reviewed  existing  conditions  and  existing  recommendations  addressing  the 
Dundee  Crossings  Study  Area  to  identify  the  opportunities  and  constraints  for  transitorientated 
development.  This  review  included  current  land  use  and  environmental  conditions,  regional 
demographic trends, and existing transit services, transportation patterns and commuting preferences.  
 
Due  to  the  Village's  location  among  highgrowth  communities  along  the  I90  Corridor,  opportunities 
were identified for linking the northwest suburbs,  Elgin, and new  business park development at Dundee 
Crossings,  as  well  as  capturing  a  share  of  the  region's  larger  commuting  traffic.  Constraints  include  high 
congestion  at  Route  72  and  Route  25,  the  proposed  Randall  Road  BRT  Line,  and  limited  demand  from 
Prairie  Stone  and  Metra  commuters.  While  the  lack  of  transit  services  in  the  far  northwest  suburbs  and 
area  activity  generators  allow  some  potential  for  a  transit  center  at  Dundee  Crossings,  greater  potential 
exists  for  developing  the  Study  Area  as  a  regional  employment  center  that  capitalizes  on  existing  land 
use  patterns  and  locational  advantages  at  the  Cook/Kane  County  boarder.  Subsequent  planning  tasks 
explored the transportation needs, as well as supportive land uses and amenities for this area. 
 
Task 2: Transportation Needs Analysis 
 
The goal of this task was to provide a clear understanding of travel demand, trip patterns, modal 
preferences, and transportation needs at Dundee Crossings. The approach included two focuses: a 
traffic analysis evaluating traffic patterns and modes of transportation through field observations; and a 
transit analysis evaluating existing and potential new transit services.  
 
Findings  of  the  transportation  analysis  indicated  that  Route  72  is  the  most  trafficked  roadway  in  the 
Study Area, serving as an alternative regional transportation route to I90, followed by Routes 25 serving 
as  a  regional  northsouth  arterial  and  Route  68  primarily  servicing  nearby  residential  areas.  The 
dominant  existing  mode  of  transportation  was  determined  to  be  regional  vehicular  traffic,  while  bicycle

and  pedestrian  traffic  were  minimal.  Congestion  at  the  intersection  of  Route  25  and  Route  72  caused 
these  roadways  to  operate  at  below  acceptable  levels  during  the  AM  and  PM  peak  hours.  The  results  of 
this analysis informed the transit analysis portion of this task. 
 
 Results  from  the  transit  analysis  indicated  that  current  population,  projected  population  growth,  and 
geographic  gaps  in  transit  service  could  support  up  to  two  new  bus  routes  in  the  area  that  would 
alleviate  congestion  at  the  72/25  intersection.  These  proposed  routes  would  link  the  northwest  suburbs 
to  Dundee  Crossings,  Prairie  Stone,  and  potentially  the  Hoffman  Estates  STAR  line  Station  via  Route  72, 
and  link  future  employment  and  other  activity  generators  at  Dundee  Crossings  into  the  regional 
transportation  network.  Based  on  redevelopment  opportunities  at  Dundee  Crossings,  potential  was 
found  for  a  smallscale  transit  center  accommodating  up  to  six  buses  and  providing  other 
transportationsupporting  facilities  for  parkandride  users,  bicyclists  and  pedestrians  during  peak  hours 
to further alleviate congestion.   
 
Task 3: Development Site Assessment and Concepts 
 
The  goal  of  this  task  was  to  prepare  conceptual  redevelopment  plans  for  the  study  area  based  upon  the 
finds  in  Tasks  1  and  2,  and  Village  goals  and  objectives.  Four  plans  were  developed  to  illustrate  the 
overall  potential  land  uses,  layout,  density,  and  orientation  of  future  development  as  well  as  potential 
transit  routes  and  transit  supportive  site  features.  Alternative  concept  plans  were  also  prepared  for  the 
River Valley Shopping Center, Santa's Village, and WalMart sites.  
 
Task 4: Public Involvement ­ Community Input and Visioning 
 
Following the completion of Tasks 1, 2, and 3, a workshop was conducted on January 25, 2010 to receive 
feedback  on  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  study,  its  general  findings,  and  input  on  the  redevelopment 
concepts.  The  community  was  encouraged  to  ask  questions  and  comment  on  the  concept  plans 
presented, which was taken into account in developing the preferred concept plan.  
 
Feedback  was  very  positive  regarding  the  proposed  land  uses  and  nature  of  proposed  redevelopment. 
Specific  comments  included support for increased transit services to the northwest suburbs, maximizing 
the  utilization  of  the  Cook  County  parcel,  and  incorporating  a  health/wellness  component  in  the  plan. 
These  comments  were  used  to  guide  the  development  of  the  preferred  concept  plan  and 
implementation strategies.   
 
Task 5: Area Redevelopment Plan and Design Guidelines 
 
Based on public input, the Steering Committee selected a preferred concept plan from the alternatives 
presented under Task 4. The Consultant Team developed a final Dundee Crossing Preferred Concept 
Plan, including an overlay of transportation patterns, and design guidelines to convey the expected level 
of development quality to potential developers.  
 
The  preferred  concept  plan  illustrates  opportunities  for  commercial  redevelopment  at  the  WalMart 
site,  residential  and  health/wellness  development  at  the  River  Valley  Square  Shopping  Center  site, 
public/institutional  uses  at  the  Cook  County  site,  and  business  park  expansion  at  the  Santa's  Village  site 
and land located north and south of Route 72.

Village of East Dundee                                      Dundee Crossings Transit and Redevelopment Study 

Design  guidelines  verbally  and  graphically  communicate  standards  for  buildings,  parking,  stormwater 
management,  streetscaping,  and  pedestrian  and  transitsupportive  amenities.  Together,  these 
guidelines establish a clear set of expectations to ensure that future development will be consistent with 
the objectives of the community and to ensure that the sites' strategic location within the overall O'Hare 
corridor  are  maximized,  including  the  ability  to  provide  owners  of  land  and  companies  a  lower  cost  of 
doing business in a high quality environment  with access to transit services and highway transportation. 
 
The  results  of  this  task  were  shared  with  the  community  in  two  public  workshops  and  with  private 
developers  through  oneonone  meetings  to  determine  implementation  strategies  for  the  Dundee 
Crossings Study Area.    
 
Task 6: Public Workshop ­ Community Review and Feedback 
 
The Preferred Concept Plan and Design Guidelines were presented, discussed and wellreceived by the 
public at a workshop presentation on May 24, 2010.   
 
Task 7: Implementation Strategies 
 
The  purpose  of  this  task  was  to  prepare  an  overall  phased  implementation  strategy  to  accomplish  the 
objectives  for  Dundee  Crossings.  The  Consultant  Team  reviewed  outcomes  from  previous  tasks  against 
current  plans,  zoning,  ownership,  existing  site  conditions  and  available  funding  sources.  The  results  of 
this  analysis  were  summarized  in  a  matrix  addressing  areawide  and  sitespecific  action  steps,  as  well  as 
the initial leads under each strategy. 
  
The  implementation  strategy  is  intended  to  guide  the  Village  in  working  with  other  public  agencies  and 
the  private  sector  to  market  the  site,  identify  and  obtain  funding  sources,  and  manage  redevelopment 
activities  at  Dundee  Crossings.  Recommended  timeframes  and  general  priority  levels  indicate  a  possible 
course  of  progression  based  on  current  available  information  and  market  conditions,  but  could  be 
adapted to respond to changing market conditions and actual redevelopment activities.  
 
The  Village  should  continue  devoting  staff  resources  to  usher  this  report  and  its  recommendations 
through  the  public  approval  process.  Continued  outreach  and  proactive  communication  on  the  part  of 
the  Village  with  other  public  agencies,  land  owners,  and  the  development  community  will  be  a  key 
factor in implementing the Dundee Crossings Preferred Concept Plan and Design Guidelines.

Population and income data was obtained through ESRI, a nationally recognized provider of
demographic data, for communities located primarily north and west of East Dundee. A large
amount of development and comparatively lower availability of existing public transit options in
these communities suggests the potential for additional regional demand. These communities are
listed in Table 1 below. According to ESRI, these communities experienced an overall growth
rate of 20 percent from 2000 to 2009. The fastest growing communities in the region were
Gilberts (320 percent) and Huntley (276 percent). By 2014, the total population in this region is
projected to grow 368,533 with the largest amount of population growth contributed by Huntley
and Carpentersville. Together, these two communities are projected to add approximately 9,538
people to the region. These population trends are detailed in Table 1 below.

According to industry studies on public transit in the suburbs, a significant portion of bus
ridership is comprised of lower income residents, youth/students, the elderly, and disabled
persons. Based on this conclusion, several demographic factors were identified that could
potentially influence demand for transit services. These factors include age cohorts under 25
years and over 65 years, household income levels below 60 percent Area Median Income (AMI),
and disability status.

According to ESRI, much of the population growth experienced in this area between 2000 and
2009 has been among households earning between $50,000 and $100,000 per year. The 2009
median income for East Dundee and surrounding communities listed in Table 1 above was
reported as $78,200. Over this same period, the number of affluent households earning more than
$150,000 has also decreased. ESRI data estimates that in 2009, the number of households by
income that are at or below 60 percent AMI (approximately $49,000) in East Dundee and
surrounding communities was 28,326 households. This number is expected to grow by 3.9% to

Greyhound, which travels to 36 locations in Illinois and numerous other national and
international locations. Rockford is the closest location to East Dundee at approximately 50
minutes in travel time.

The second Pace depot, which is the closest to Dundee Crossings, is the Prairie Stone Transit
Center. The transit options at this location include three Pace Routes (Routes 610, 1012, and
767), with pick up locations reaching as far as the south suburbs. Additionally, the Prairie Stone
Transportation Management Association (TMA) provides alternative transportation options from
Chicago and area suburbs. Over 30 active and successful Pace-sponsored vanpools and an
employee carpooling organization are available to employees of Prairie Stone. These options
also provide connections to area Metra train stations; however, these routes do not currently
provide direct local access to East Dundee.

Rail transit lines providing service to the regional study area include the Metra Union Pacific
Northwest Line and the Metra Milwaukee District West Line. The closest Metra stations to East
Dundee are located in Barrington and Fox River Grove along the Union Pacific Northwest Line;
and in Elgin along the Metra Milwaukee District West Line. Metra's 2006 Origin-Destination
Survey indicated that the largest number of passengers on these lines originate from
Carpentersville, Huntley, Gilberts, Elgin, South Elgin, Barrington, and Lake Zurich. Passengers
originating from East Dundee account for approximately one percent of ridership at the Big
Timber Station and Elgin Station, and approximately two percent of ridership at the National
Street Station on the Metra Milwaukee District West Line. Passengers from East Dundee account
for less than one percent of the ridership at the Barrington Metra Station on the Metra Union
Pacific Northwest Line.

Metra mode of access data for all passengers on these rail lines indicated similar preferences to
the American Community Survey journey to work data. Approximately 92 percent (3,392
passengers) accessed train stations by car or taxi, approximately one percent (35 passengers) by
bus, and approximately seven percent walked.

Existing bus and train transit lines in the regional study area are shown on Map 1.

There are two proposed major transportation projects that will have an impact on the
development of the transit center in East Dundee. Currently, there is a proposal to create another
commuter transit line along the Canadian National Railway/Elgin-Joliet-Eastern (CN/EJ&E)
right-of-way south of I-90. This line would primarily serve commuters in "outer-ring" suburbs
and provide a public transportation option for commuters traveling from suburb to suburb. As
proposed, the potential commuter line would have a train station adjacent to the Prairie Stone
Business Park. The second planned project includes a Pace Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line along
Randall Road. This bus route would be a limited stop service that provides rapid transit between
Crystal Lake and Algonquin, the west side of Elgin, and the City of Aurora. While both projects
are in the early planning stages, their formation could significantly impact the development
potential for a transit center in East Dundee.

AREA ACTIVITY GENERATORS

Based on the data derived about transit dependent populations, the consultant team identified key
"activity generators" that are more likely to yield bus transit ridership. Area activity generators
were identified as senior and affordable housing communities, post-secondary schools, major
employment centers, and shopping centers. Each of these is outlined below:

       Senior and Affordable Housing Communities: Large senior housing communities
       containing more than 30 units per community were identified in the regional study area.
       Thirteen senior communities were identified in Elgin, Algonquin, Hoffman Estates, West
       Dundee and Carpentersville that contain a total of 1,429 units. Affordable housing
       communities affiliated with the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
       (HUD), the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA), and Elgin Housing
       Authority were also identified in the regional study area. Another 13 affordable housing
       communities were identified in Elgin and Carpentersville that contain a total of 999 units.
       Map 2 shows the location of senior and affordable housing communities in the regional
       study area.

       Post-Secondary Schools: Elgin Community College's main campus is located at the
       intersection of Route 20 and McClean Boulevard in Elgin. The college currently has an
       enrollment of 12,000 students and employs more than 1,000 faculty and staff. The college
       is expanding their campus and is in the process of building and planning for multiple on-
       site and off-site facilities. Judson University is located at the Intersection of Route 31 and
       I-90 in Elgin. The university has a student body of over 1,200 students and employs
       approximately 200 faculty and staff. The locations of both schools are shown on Map 3.

       Major Employment Centers: Major employment centers were defined as single
       businesses that employ over 500 individuals per business and clusters of businesses that
       each employ over 100 individuals per business. Employment data was obtained through
       ESRI Business Analyst software.

       Clusters of businesses employing 100 or more individuals per business are located in and
       adjacent to the Prairie Stone Business Park (9,300 employees), near the Barrington Metra
       Station (3,780 employees), Spring Hill Mall (400 employees), Crystal Point Mall (5,980
       employees) and the intersections of Route 72 and I-90; Route 31 and I-90; Randall Road
       and I-90; and Randall Road and Algonquin Road. Additional clusters are located in Elgin
       near Larkin High School, downtown Elgin, and adjacent to Elgin Community College.

       The largest individual employers in this region include Sears Center and Kmart (7,800),
       St. Alexius Medical Center (2,100), and Sherman Hospital (2,000). An additional 32
       large businesses contribute 22,800 jobs to the regional economy. Map 3 shows the
       location of these employment centers within a 10-mile radius from the potential transit
       center location in East Dundee. Table 2 on the following page outlines the name,
       location, and number of employees at each of these businesses.

      Shopping Centers: One of the largest shopping centers in the region, Woodfield Mall, is
      located immediately east of East Dundee along Route 72. Additionally, Springhill Mall
      and Algonquin Commons are located west and northwest of Dundee Crossings. The
      locations of these shopping centers are shown on Map 4. A variety of smaller scale
      community and neighborhood shopping centers are also clustered along arterial corridors
      and around intersections throughout the regional area.

      The largest shopping centers in the area include Springhill Mall, Algonquin Commons,
      The Arboretum of South Barrington, and Poplar Creek Crossing. Springhill Mall is
      located approximately two miles west of Dundee Crossings on Route 72, and is anchored
      by Sears, J. C. Penney, Macy's, and Carson's. Algonquin Commons is located
      approximately seven miles northwest and is one of the largest lifestyle centers in Illinois.
      The Arboretum of South Barrington and Poplar Creek Crossing are located adjacent to
      the Prairie Stone Business Park at the intersection of Route 72 and Route 59 (Sutton
      Road). The Arboretum of South Barrington is a lifestyle center containing over 600,000
      square feet of retail space and upscale tenants such as Gold Class Cinema and Pinstripes
      Bowling, Bocce, and Bistro. Year-round community events at the center add to its
      regional draw as a destination place. Poplar Creek Crossing is a power center located
      directly south of The Arboretum. This shopping center contains over 400,000 square feet
      and national tenants such as Target, The Sports Authority, and Michael's.

       The Randall Road corridor contains an array of community and neighborhood shopping
       centers, many of which also contain large-format national tenants. The Algonquin
       Commons area is the largest node along this corridor, which contains a conglomerate of
       three shopping centers located at the intersection of Randall Road and N. County Line
       Road. Algonquin Commons is a large-scale lifestyle center containing 656,000 square
       feet of retail and hosting year-round community events. The two adjacent shopping
       centers are Randall Crossing and Algonquin Galleria. Together these three shopping
       centers contain 967,000 square feet.

       Other smaller-scale community shopping centers are clustered along various arterials and
       intersections in the regional study area. These clusters generally include the area near
       Spring Hill Mall in West Dundee; the Route 25 corridor from Algonquin to downtown
       Elgin; and the corridors of Route 31, Route 19, and Route 20 (Larkin Avenue) in Elgin.

POTENTIAL TRANSIT CENTER LOCATIONS

Potential sites for the transit center study area are generally centered in or near the Dundee
Crossings area. Routes 72 and 25 are major arterial roadways that support regional vehicular
traffic, provide direct access to I-90, and currently support two Pace transit routes through East
Dundee. Several available land sites are also located at this intersection. Site characteristics for
each quadrant of the intersection are summarized below.

       Northwest Quadrant: The River Valley Square shopping center contains approximately
       170,000 square feet of retail space and approximately 14.6 acres of land. This quadrant
       has strong visibility from Route 25 and Route 72. Dominick's has relocated from the
       shopping center leaving approximately 50 percent of the total retail space vacant. There is
       currently no anchor at the site. A market study was conducted for the shopping center that
       concluded the potential viability for a small-scale grocer as an anchor.

       Northeast Quadrant: The former Palumbo quarry site is located in this quadrant. The
       Terra Business Park is currently under construction at the Palumbo site. One building has
       been completed that is approximately 53,000 square feet. The entire quarry reclamation
       area measures 338.9 acres and contains a lake on the northern half of the site, leaving
       approximately 120 acres of developable land. The southern half of the site is located in
       the Dundee Crossings Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district; the northern half of the site
       will be included in a new TIF district.

       The Illinois Route 72 and Illinois Route 25 Business District Development Plan
       recommends a mix of retail and industrial uses at this site. Kane County GIS parcel
       records indicate that three lots have been subdivided for the business park totaling 9.9
       acres. These lots front Route 72 and are adjacent to an existing business park located to
       the east. The Prairie Valley Business Park is also located to the north of the Palumbo site.

       Southeast Quadrant: Wal-Mart contains 120,000 square feet of building space on 13.7
       acres of land. Two outlot sites fronting Route 72 contain an additional two acres of land.

        Wal-Mart is scheduled to close within a one-year timeframe and Farm & Fleet has shown
        interest in this site. Since the Wal-Mart site is located behind The Community Thrift
        Store building, it has limited visibility from both roadways. The thrift store is situated
        directly on the corner and has a large amount of surface parking along both roadways. A
        vacant land site is located directly south of Wal-Mart and contains 1.7 acres of land
        marketed for office or retail development. This site has stronger visibility, but is only
        visible and accessible from Route 25.

        Southwest Quadrant: The former Santa's Village amusement park site contains 38 acres
        of land and a total of 1.5 million square feet of sporting and events space. The topography
        on portions of the site would require grading for redevelopment. The eastern portion has
        strong visibility and level topography along Route 72 where a large parking lot currently
        exists; however, visibility on the northern portion along Route 25 is limited by dense
        vegetation and sloping topography.

All of the aforementioned sites (unless specified otherwise) are located in the Dundee Crossings
TIF district.

OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS

There are several opportunities and constraints associated with the potential location of a transit
center within Dundee Crossings. The following outlines the rationale for each prospect.

Opportunities

    ·   New Industrial Development and Connection to Northwest Suburbs. New industrial
        park development in East Dundee, combined with regional population growth in the
        communities located northwest of East Dundee could generate ridership for potential
        extensions and/or relocations of the regional Pace bus route network. In particular, the
        Terra Business Park is a large industrial development that has the potential to draw
        several employees from neighboring and area suburbs. Although much of the area is
        reliant on private vehicles as a primary mode of transportation, many of the communities
        northwest of East Dundee have similar demographic profiles but have limited or no
        access to bus transit. Current suburb to suburb travel is only possible through private
        vehicle means. Depending on the development scale, Dundee Crossings could demand an
        internal transportation center focused on business park tenants similar to what has been
        arranged at Prairie Stone.

    ·   Northwest Suburbs' Connection to Elgin. Public transit connections from the far
        northwest suburbs to Elgin present a potential opportunity for an East Dundee transit
        center. Currently, there is no public transit connection from the far northwest suburbs to
        Elgin. Particularly in the downtown and near I-90 and Randall Road, Elgin is a key
        employment center for Kane County. Interviews with Elgin Community College unveiled
        that there are several unskilled labor jobs within companies at I-90 and Randall Road and
        in downtown Elgin; these workers are target candidates for public transit. A transit center

        and transfer point at the intersection of Route 72 and Route 25 can connect far northwest
        suburban commuters to the existing Pace route 543 that services downtown Elgin and
        provide an option for travel further along Route 72 to reach Prairie Stone and possibly
        Schaumburg.

    ·   Capturing a Share of the Larger Region's Commuter Traffic. I-90 is the major
        expressway that provides access to the East Dundee area from the entire Chicago region.
        While there are existing bus routes that directly serve Prairie Stone that use I-90 as
        primary route, there are no public transportation options from Prairie Stone to other
        employment centers in the area. Our research has identified there are more than 25,000
        jobs among 40 of the area's largest employers. This figure does not take into account
        other smaller businesses or other activity generators in and around East Dundee. Per
        interviews with Elgin Community College, many of these businesses, particularly
        industrial businesses along Route 25 in Carpentersville and Elgin that hire unskilled
        laborers, have workers that travel from Chicago. Similar to the potential opportunity
        connecting the northwest suburbs to Elgin, workers from the balance of the region
        (whose end destination is not Prairie Stone) can utilize an East Dundee terminal as
        transfer point to get access to other employment centers in the area north and south of
        Dundee Crossings area.

Constraints

    ·   Traffic Congestion at Routes 72 and 25. According to the traffic study conducted by
        Regina Webster & Associates (RWA), the Dundee Crossings intersection is highly
        congested at peak travel times. During the morning rush hour, the intersection had the
        worst level of service (LOS F). The evening rush hour traffic conditions are better but
        there is still considerable congestion during the evening hours (more details can be found
        in RWA's traffic analysis memorandum). Adding bus traffic during peak hours on
        already congested roads could make bus transit less desirable to potential commuters.

    ·   Proposed Randall Road BRT Line. Randall Road is a major thoroughfare connects the
        northwest suburbs to two of the largest cities in Illinois- Elgin and Aurora. The Randall
        Road BRT threatens the viability of a Dundee Crossings transit center because of its
        direct connection to employment centers in Elgin and Aurora. Although the Randall Road
        BRT would service the western edge of Elgin, the balance of Elgin is well served by bus
        transit and connections to the downtown could be made using existing routes. East
        Dundee would no longer serve as a rational transfer point for northwest suburban
        commuters traveling to Elgin.

    ·   Prairie Stone is a Limited Demand Source. With 9,300 employees just five minutes
        southeast of the Dundee Crossings area, Prairie Stone Business Park was initially seen as
        a strong potential demand source for bus transit in East Dundee. After interviewing the
        Executive Director of the Prairie Stone TMA, it appears that existing Pace services as
        well as collaborative van and car pools are very successful and are adequately serving the
        business park's employees (more details can be found in HDR's existing conditions

        memorandum). While improvements to better service employees coming from the far
        northwest suburbs was considered, the direct access and the short distance between
        Dundee Crossings and Prairie Stone would not necessarily require a transfer point in East
        Dundee.

    ·   Limited Demand Source via Existing Metra Service. Initial findings do not show
        Metra as a significant demand generator for a bus transit center in the Dundee Crossings
        area. The Dundee Crossings intersection is equidistant from the two area train lines.
        Commuters alighting the train from the Barrington Station on the Union Pacific line are
        likely working in office clusters in Barrington. Commuters at the Elgin stations along the
        Metra Milwaukee District West Line have access to existing bus transit to get to area
        employment centers without transfers into East Dundee. This finding was further
        substantiated by our interview with the Prairie Stone TMA. The TMA ran a pilot program
        for shuttle service from the existing Metra stations at Bartlett and Barrington. The
        Executive Director said the program, at best, received a total of five riders on a daily
        basis. The program was ultimately discontinued.

FINDINGS AND NEXT STEPS

The lack of public transportation options in the far northwest suburbs, the area's activity
generators, and new industrial development allows for some opportunities to potentially develop
a transit center in the Dundee Crossings area. However, there are notable barriers and potential
constraints to Dundee Crossings being the prime location for this type of center. In moving
forward, more emphasis should be placed on identifying local transit dependent populations. To
the extent available, we will look to review data from Pace related to the origin and destination
of commuters on existing area Pace routes. East Dundee business parks and their commuter
needs should also be considered. An interview with representatives of the Terra Business Park to
understand their master plan and tenant mix may prove to be useful in understanding the
demographics of their workforce and their transit needs.

RE: East Dundee ­ Dundee Crossings, 2009: Existing Conditions Summary




1.0 
0B               INTRODUCTION
The  Village  of  East  Dundee  is  located  approximately  40  miles  northwest  of  Chicago.   The  community  is  located  in  the 
path  of  suburban  development  that  is  continuing  to  spread  into  the  northwest  suburbs  of  Cook,  Kane,  and  McHenry 
Counties.   Considering  the  fact  that  the  Fox  River  runs  through  the  downtown  area,  as  well  as  binding  the  community 
on the west, opportunities for economic and residential growth exist.   

     The  purpose  of  this  Summary  is  to  help  determine  a  location  for  the  "Dundee  Crossings  Transit  Center"  within  the 
     Village  of  East  Dundee.     The  Dundee  Crossings  area  is  a  strategic  location  that  will  become  increasingly  important  to 
     the region and the transit network.  This area is located around the IL 72/IL 25 Intersection, which is centrally located in 
     relation  to  the  Village's  Planning  Units.    This  proposed  Transit  Center  could  be  considered  an  important  hub  in  the 
     regional  transportation  network  in  order  to  plan  for  transitoriented  development  that  would  encourage  ridership  and 
     promote  economic  development  in  the  Village  of  East  Dundee.    A  transit  center  would  also  provide  greater  transit 
     access  to  major  employment centers, growing  residential areas,  and  new  regional  transit  investments.     This proposed 
     Transit  Center  could  include  a  parkandride  facility,  a  transfer  point  for  multiple  converging  bus  routes,  and  transit
     oriented redevelopment of vacant and underused properties around the Center.   

                 OVERVIEW 
                 6B




                 The  Village  of  East  Dundee  has  undertaken  a  number  of  planning  studies,  surveys,  and  development  plans 
                 within  the  last  ten  years.   These  planning  efforts  have  identified  new  land  uses,  transportation  infrastructure 
                 investments, proposed business development districts, as well as, local transit needs.  

                      This  memorandum  provides  an  inventory  of  existing  land  uses,  demographics,  transportation  facilities, 
                      proposed  infrastructure  improvements  and  a  summary  of  previous  studies  specific  to  East  Dundee  and  more 
                      specifically, Dundee Crossings.

          VILLAGE OF EAST DUNDEE 
          7B




          According  to  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  the  Village's  population  was  documented  at  just  fewer  than  3,000  residents 
          in 2000.   Of this 3,000 population, approximately 94 percent were of white race and 1.7 percent was of Asian 
          race.    According  to  the  ESRI  2006  estimates,  within  three  miles  of  Dundee  Crossings,  the  population  was 
          estimated to reach 56,830; however, ESRI data indicates that this threemile radius population will increase by 
          approximately  2.8  percent  by  2011.    According  to  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  statistics,  year  2000  employment 
          was approximately 1,810 people, which equates to approximately 76 percent of the Village's population.   

          From  Northeastern  Illinois  Planning  Commission's  (currently  Chicago  Metropolitan  Agency  for  Planning, 
          CMAP)  endorsed  2030  population  forecast,  East  Dundee  is  projected  to  comprise  of  approximately  8,000 
          residents  and  4,400  employed,  which  reflects  an  increase  of  1,500  employees  since  2000..    This  growth  is 
          comparable to the growth rates of neighboring communities like West Dundee and Carpentersville.   

          According to the U.S. Census Bureau statistics, travel to employment centers average around 27 minutes.   

          In  2006,  the  Village  had  a  total  of  over  240  registered  businesses  ranging  from  food  and  restaurant 
          establishments  to  light  industrial  manufacturing.   Leading  majority  of  the  businesses  located  in  the  vicinity  of 
          Dundee  Crossings  is  Service  Businesses,  Retail,  and  Manufacturing  encompassing  40  percent,  19  percent,  and 
          18 percent, respectively.

3.0  LAND USE AND ZONING 
2B




The  Village  of  East  Dundee  plans  land  use  by  planning  units,  which  are  portions  of  the  community  that  share  common 
characteristics.    The  Dundee  Crossings  area  is  made  up  of  parts  of  Planning  Units  Three,  Four,  and  Seven,  since  it  is 
located  at  an  intersection  near  the  general  origin  of  the  Village  boundaries.      The  insert  below  was  taken  from  the 
Village  of  East  Dundee  Official  Zoning  Map,  dated  September  2007,  and  identifies  all  four  quadrants  of  Dundee 
Crossings.  The northwest,  southwest,  and  southeast  quadrants  are  zoned  as  B3: Service  Business  with  small  pockets  of 
B2:  Community  Business  along  IL  72.    The  northeast  corner,  of  which  majority  is  not  redeveloped,  is  zoned  for  S1:  
Single Family use.  

Villagewide,  the  land  use  ranges  from  residential  to 
commercial  to  industrial.    Although  current  quarry  activity 
takes  place,  land  use  within  the  vicinity  of  Dundee  Crossings 
is  underutilized  vacant  retail,  as  well  as,  undeveloped 
property.    On  the  northeast  corner  is  the  Pal  Property 
development   at  120  acres.   Considering  that  approximately 
54,000  vehicles  per  day  traverse  through  the  intersection  of 
IL  72  /  IL  25,  retail  and  office  land  uses  would  best  suit  the 
Village's  intentions.    Future  development  on  another  100 
acres  north  includes  residential  development.    The 
underutilized  retail  strip  is  the  River  Valley  Mall  located  on 
the  northwest  corner  of  Dundee  Crossings.   Due  to  changes 
                                                                                                              Dundee Crossings
in  market  trends,  the  mall  would  potentially  shift  its  front 
image  to  IL  72  and  remain  as  retail  land  use.    The  existing                         Village of Dundee Zoning Map, September 2007
WalMart  on  the  southeast  corner  of  Dundee  Crossings  will 
be  available  for  development  since  the  newly  proposed  site  is  in  West  Dundee.    The  Village's  vision  for  this  corner 
maintains  retail  and  office  users  looking  to  increase  traffic  along  IL  72  and  IL  25.   The  southwest  corner  was  home  to 
Santa's  Village  for  over  50  years  until  recently.   The  Village  is  pursuing  redevelopment  consistent  with  their  vision  of 
commercial land uses for this parcel.   

As  stated  in  the  Village's  Comprehensive  Plan,  any  redevelopment  shall  continue  to  maintain  the  Village's  focus  for 
promoting  integration  of  multiple  uses,  existing  natural  resources,  and  variety  of  user  needs.    (See  Section  5.0  for 
further details on this Plan).  

          RECREATION LANDS 
          9B




          The  Dundee  Township  Park  District  maintains  and  proposes  any  recreational  areas  and  facilities  within  the 
          Village.   As  of  September  2009,  East  Dundee's  major  community  recreation  facility  is  Lion  Park  located  south 
          of  Main  Street  in  downtown  East  Dundee.    Recently  added  since  the  last  update  to  the  Village's 
          Comprehensive Plan in October 2002 is Bartels Park located at River Street, south of Barrington Avenue.

                        and   south   of   IL   72.   This   District   was   created   in   2006   in   an   attempt   to   bring   economic  
                        development   to   the   community.

                ·       Proposed  TIF  District:    In   an   effort   to   increase   development   in   the   area,   the   Village   is  
                        currently   considering   another   District   in   the   Palumbo  120  acre   gravel   pit   property,   which   is  
                        located   near   the   commercial   corridor   along   IL   25,   just   north   of   the   existing   Dundee  
                        Crossings   TIF   District.   If   the   proposal   is   approved,   it   would   essentially   connect  two  existing 
                        District  together   Dundee  Crossings  TIF  District  and  Prairie  Lakes  TIF  District.    If  the  TIF  districts  at 
                        Dundee  Crossings  and  Prairie  Lakes  become  contiguous,  any  revenue  created  from  either  district  can

          BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS 
          1B




          As  noted  in  the  Village's  Comprehensive  Plan,  employers  tend  to  concentrate  in  areas  with  excellent 
          transportation  access.    New  office,  retail,  and  service  businesses  are  seeking  locations  that  are  highly 
          accessible  to  a  transportation  system  prior  to  commitment  of  development.   As  of  2002,  over  80  percent  of 
          the  employment  in  East  Dundee  is 
          retail and trade services.     

          As  seen  in  the  Business  Development 
          District  Map  insert,  Dundee  Crossings, 
          with  the  exception  of  the  northeast 
                                                                                                                     Dundee Crossings

          Business        Development          District 
          boundaries.   

          A  business  development  district  is 
          similar  to  a  tax  increment  financing 
          district,  or  TIF  district,  but  is  salestax 
          driven.  In  the  business  development 
          district,  an  additional  half  percent  in 
                                                                   East Dundee Business Development District Map, Gerald L. Heinz & Associates, 2008

          sales  taxes  is  applied,  bringing  sales  taxes  in  the  district  to  9  percent.  If  approved,  the  additional  sales  tax 
          would go into effect Jan. 1, 2010.  Any revenue generated by the halfpercent increase will be used to improve 
          the  business  district.  In  a  TIF  District,  as  the  value  of  properties  increases,  the  extra  tax  revenue  properties 
          generate are used to redevelop the district. 

          Dundee   Crossings   

          As  previously  mentioned,  the  Village  has  branded  the  commercial  redevelopment  intersection  of  IL  72  and  IL 
          25  as  Dundee  Crossings.   The  Village  has  prepared  this  intersection  for  development  and  investment  as  it  was 
          created in 2006 as an attempt to bring economic development tools to the area, the Village offers incremental 
          property  taxes  to  developers  as  an  incentive  for  new  construction.  Revenues  from  Dundee  Crossings will  also 
          help  upgrade  inadequate  infrastructure  in  the  Crossings  vicinity.   In  May  of  2008,  the  Village  applied  for  ITEP 
          funding  for  initial  streetscape  enhancements  to  portions  of  IL  72  and  IL  25,  including  a  0.8  mile  commuter 
          bicycle/pedestrian  path  connecting  the  IL  72/IL  25  Intersection  to  the  downtown  riverfront,  Fox  River  Trail, 
          and Dundee Crossings.   

          Dundee   Gateway  

          The approximate 12acre property at the corner of IL 25 and IL 68 is known as Dundee Gateway.  This business 
          development  district  was  created  and  approved  by  the  Village  Board  as  of  September  2009.    The  Dundee 
          Gateway  development  is  under  construction  with  a  Thornton's  Gas  Station  as  the  first  of  the  outlots.  
          Thornton's is expected to open in the 1st quarter of 2010.   

          Route   25   and   Route   72   Corridor  

          This  District  was  created  in  September  2008  in  order  to  generate  funds  and  show  a  sense  of  redevelopment 
          urgency  to  the  community.   The  IL  25  and  IL  72  Business  Development  District  is  intended  to  provide  upfront 
          financing  for  more  immediate  improvements  along  IL  25,  as  recommended  by  the  Route  72  Corridor 
          Improvement Plan. (See Section 5.0 for further details regarding this Plan).

          Prairie   Stone  

          Three  miles  east  of  the  IL  25/IL  72  Intersection,  is  the  Prairie  Stone  development,  a  780acre  master  planned 
          business park that employs in excess of 10,000 workers.  Prairie Stone includes Sears, KMart, Wt Engineering, 
          ICAR  Corporate  Headquarters,  Mary  Kay  Cosmetics  Regional  Office  and  Distribution  Center,  and  Serta's 
          Research  and  Development  facility.    Prairie  Stone  also  includes  a  295room  Marriott  Hotel,  and  the  Sears 
          Centre,  Chicago  area's  newest  sports  and  entertainment  venue.    An  outdoor  musical  venue  is  to  be 
          constructed  in 2009,  and  plans  are  in  the  works  for a  water  park/hotel complex.  A  proposed Metra  STAR  Line 
          Station is planned for Prairie Stone.    (See Section 5.0 for further details of this Study).  

          Wal  Mart   Relocation:   West   Dundee   

          The  existing  WalMart  at  Dundee  Crossings  on  the  southeast  corner  is  in  the  process  of  being  relocated  to  a 
          potential  new  site  within  the  Village  of  West  Dundee.   This  would  ultimately  redistribute  commercial  traffic 
          from  Dundee  Crossings  onto  routes  to  the  north  and  west  near  Spring  Hill  Mall,  where  the  new  site  is 
          proposed.

          recorded  for  2007.    As  the  northsouth  route  through  the  Crossings,  IL  25  connects  the  area  to  I90,  to 
          Downtown  Elgin,  and  the  Metra's  Milwaukee  DistrictWest  Line  connecting  to  downtown  Chicago.  
          Additionally,  the  Fox  River  Grove  Metra  Station  on  the  UP  Northwest  Line  is  nine  miles  north  of  Dundee 
          Crossings.   

          Illinois  Route  68  (IL  68)  is  classified  as  a  principal  arterial  that  runs  eastwest  from  IL  72  (Higgins  Road)  in  the 
          Dundee  area  to  I94  in  Glencoe.   IL 68  serves  the north  end  of  the  Village  and also  the  northern  entry  into  the

          Downtown  District.    To  the  east,  the  roadway  provides  connections  to  Palatine,  Barrington,  and  other 
          northern suburbs. From recorded 2007 data, IL 68 experiences an ADT of approximately 13,700 vpd.     

          TRAVEL PATTERNS 
          13B




          By  conducting  existing  peak  hour  traffic  counts  at  and  adjacent  to  Dundee  Crossings,  the  existing  travel 
          patterns  can  be  determined.    Focusing  on  the  intersection  of  IL72  /IL  25,  that  make  up  Dundee  Crossings, 
          during  the  weekday  morning  peak  hour,  major  flow  is  in  the  eastbound  and  southbound  directions.   Opposite 
          travel  patterns,  as  would  expect,  occur  in  the  afternoon  peak  hour,  being  major  flow  in  the  westbound  and 
          northbound  directions.   It  is  suggested  that  IL  72,  is  being  utilized  as  an  alternate  route  for  I90  in  the  both 
          weekday peak hours.

          Prairie   Stone:   Transportation   Management   Association   (TMA)   

          The Prairie Stone Transportation Management Association (TMA) is a program that was implemented to 
          transport employees to, from, and within the Prairie Stone development utilizing and coordinating with Pace,               H      H




          Metra, CTA, and CATS methods of travel.  Working primarily with Pace, their successful operation provides a 
                       H       H       H       H




          cohesive, cooperative approach 
          to internal traffic mitigation. By 
          using a suburban bus company, 
          Pace,  the number of cars 
          entering Prairie Stone is 
          essentially reduced by 20%.  The 
          transportation system at Prairie 
          Stone is unprecedented for a 
          suburban business park.   A 
          Transportation Center has been 
          built at the Park Center to service 
          the extensive transportation 
          modes listed below: 

          Two fixedroute bus lines (Pace 
          Route 610 and 767) provide

          PEDESTRIAN/BICYCLE FACILITIES 
          15B




          According  to  current  observations,  minimal  pedestrian/bicycle  activity  occurs  at  Dundee  Crossings,  as  well 
          along  other  area  roadways  including  IL  68.    The  Village  maintains  one  existing  bicycle  trail,  of  which,  is  a 
          valuable  resource  in  the  eyes  of  the  residents  that  plans  to  be  maintained  and  yet  expanded  (as  part  of  the 
          Kane  County  2009  Bike  Plan).   This  is  one  functional  way  that  the  community  actually  brings  people  into  their 
          limits.  The existing routes within the Village of East Dundee include a regional bicycle trail that runs parallel to 
          the  Fox  River  just  west  of  Van  Buren  Road.   Other  existing  local  bicycle  routes  are  located  north  of  IL  68  just 
          west of IL 25.

The Village has undertaken a number of planning studies to enhance economic development, improve the link between 
East  Dundee  and  Chicago,  and  spark  potential  for  future  transportation  needs.      It  is  evident  that  any  infrastructure 
improvements  and  redevelopment  proposed  for  the  Dundee  Crossings  area  must  take  into  account  the  Village's  goals 
and existing plans.

          EAST DUNDEE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN 
          16B




                                      Prepared  by  Teska  Associates  on  October  21,  2002,  this  Plan  is  an  update  to  the 
                Dundee Crossings      Village's  1991  Comprehensive  Plan  although  the  planning  area  has  remained  the 
                                                 same,  in  that  the  boundaries  have  not  further  expanded  due  to  annexation.  
                                                 As noted, the most significant growth opportunity for the Village, other than 
                                                 the  redevelopment  of  existing  quarries,  is  the  southern  half  of  the  planning 
                                                 area,  generally  bounded  by  IL  72  (Higgins  Road)  to  the  north.      The  Plan 
                                                 indicates  a  significant  amount  of  growth  for  the  Dundee  Crossings  area  and 
                                                 the  eastern  end  of  the  Village,  as  well.   Between  2002  and  2020,  the  Village 
                                                 considers  themselves  to  be  a  "maturing  community".   The  Village  is  likely  to 
                                                 reach  near  full  development  during  this  planning  period.   Future  land  use  at 
                                                 Dundee  Crossings  includes  Planned  Development  Mixed  Use  in  the 
                                                 southwest  quadrant,  General  Business  in  the  southeast  and  northwest 
                                                 quadrants, and Institutional and General Business in the northeast quadrant.    

           

           

          EAST DUNDEE DOWNTOWN PLAN  
          17B




          Written  by  Vandewalle  &  Associates  and  published  on  November  13,  2007,  this  Plan  identifies  the 
          opportunities  for  development  within  Downtown  East  Dundee.  Several  redevelopment  sites  line  the  river, 
          where  the  Village  is  considering  new  housing,  business  and  a  riverwalk  system  to  allow  pedestrian  access.  
          Downtown  revitalization  will  be  greatly  influenced  with  the  redevelopment  of  three  key  sites:    Route  72 
          Corridor, the Riverfront Redevelopment Sites, and the North End.  

          DOWNTOWN TIF REDEVELOPMENT PLAN 
          18B




          Developed and published by Vandewalle & Associates on January 25, 2008, the Downtown TIF Redevelopment 
          Plan's goal was to provide a comprehensive program for the Village to promote growth and development.  The 
          Downtown  Project  Area  is  composed  of  114  acres  (including  roadway  infrastructure)  located  in  the  Village's 
          downtown  along  IL  72  and  adjacent  to  the  Fox  River.    Land  uses  in  the  Area  consist  of  retail  and  industrial 
          business, institutional uses, single family homes, as well as vacant parcels.  The land uses that are proposed for 
          the Downtown Project Area include, but are not limited to: professional office, multifamily residential, mixed
          use commercial, office/residential developments, institutional, and recreational uses.

          19B




          The  purpose  of  the  Plan,  written  by  Vandewalle  &  Associates  in  August  2008,  was  to  illustrate  and  promote 
          the  ongoing  redevelopment  work  to  make  public  improvements  and  increase  multimodal  transit  accessibility 
          along the Route 72 corridor.   

 
20B       KANE COUNTY TRANSIT OPPORTUNITY ASSESSMENT STUDY 
          This  Study  was  prepared  in  October  2002  headed  up  by  Land  Strategies,  Inc  for  transit  use  in  the  urban, 
          suburban,  and  rural  environment  in  Kane  County.   Extensive  discussion  of  land  use  and  travel  characteristics

          were  included  as  well  as  a  priority  listing  of  potential  Metra  commuter  rail  service  extensions.    Transit 
          recommendations  were  made  based  on  a  comprehensive  system  of  transit  opportunities  required  to  provide 
          residents  with  transportation  options.    These  options  included  establishing  transportation  hubs, 
          transportation  centers,  and  parknride  lots  that  are  strategically  placed  throughout  the  County  to  support 
          multimodal transportation including pedestrians/bicyclists, carpool, bus service, light rail, and commuter rail.  

          KANE COUNTY BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN PLAN  
          21B




          Adopted  in  December  2002,  the  Kane  County  Bicycle  and  Pedestrian  Plan  presenting  a  network  that  would 
          improve  public  safety  and  encourage  alternative  modes  of  transportation.      Recommendations  included  a 
          safer  environment  with  connections  between  origins  and  destinations  in  order  to  encourage  pedestrian  and 
          bicycle access to future transit centers.  

          KANE COUNTY 2030 TRANSPORTATION PLAN 
          2B




          Several  transit  and  pedestrian/bicycle  recommendations  from  this  Plan  are  proposed  within  or  surrounding 
          the  Village  of  East  Dundee.   Published  in  October  2004,  transit  recommendations  from  the  Kane  County  2030 
          Transportation Plan included a focus on five transit service areas, two of which are the Upper Fox Transit Area 
          and  the  Greater  Elgin  Transit  Area.        The  Upper  Fox  Transit  Area  includes  the  Village  of  East  Dundee  and 
          surrounding  areas.   This  area  currently  provides  Pace  bus  service  within  East  Dundee,  although  the  focus  is  to 
          provide  this  area  with  connections  to  Elgin,  the  I90  corridor,  IL  72  corridor,  and  O'Hare  Airport.    This  Plan 
          identifies the main objective to develop a local community shuttle to serve the retail and employment centers.  

          The  focus  in  the  Greater  Elgin  Transit  Area  is  to  enhance  transit  services  to  surrounding  communities  to  the 
          north,  south,  and  east.    Although  this  area  does  not  specifically  include  East  Dundee,  the  Village  could 
          potentially feed off of any transit enhancements as part of this area's objectives.   

          As  part  of  the  Bikeway  Considerations,  the  Plan  suggests  IL  68  as  a  conceptual  bikeway  corridor.   Extending 
          from  its  east  limit  of  the  Cook  County  line,  this  corridor  would  provide  bicycle  accommodations  along  IL  68 
          west to the Fox River.  Ultimately, this corridor would pass through the downtown East Dundee.   

          PACE VISION 2020 
          23B




          Published in March 2002 by Wilbur Smith Associates, the purpose of the Pace Vision 2020 plan is to provide an 
          acceptable  level  of  efficient  suburban  mobility.   Due  to  Pace's  projected  service  area  to  be  projected  at  more 
          than 6.2 million by 2020, it was necessary to plan for the increase and enhance its transit services to meet the 
          needs  of  suburban  economic  development  and  travel  markets.    The  closest  Regional  Transportation  Center 
          that  exists  as  part  of  this  plan  is  located  in  Elgin  at  the  existing  Elgin  Metra  Milwaukee  District  West  Station.  
          This  Center  has  existing  Pace  bus  fixedroute  service  that  travels  to  and  from  the  Village  of  East Dundee.    The 
          closest  existing  Community  Transportation  Center  to  the  Village  of  East  Dundee  is  at  Spring  Hill  Mall  where 
          existing Pace bus fixedroute service.

          geographic  framework  of  Centers,  Corridors,  and  Green  Areas  were  used  to  guide  regional  planning  through 
          2040.  According to the 2040 Regional Framework Map, East Dundee (as well as West Dundee) is classified as a 
          Community  Center.   The  closest  Metropolitan  Centers  to  East  Dundee  are  Elgin  to  the  south  and  Crystal  Lake 
          to  the  north.    The  NIPC  definition  of  a  "Center"  is  compact  developments  that  reflect  a  close  relationship 
          between  economic  and  livability  goals.    These  centers  should  provide  efficient  access  to  residential, 
          employment,  retail  and  civic  activities.    Two  achieve  the  goal  of  a  community  center,  three  activities  are 
          suggested:    1)    Growth  should  be  redirected  from  undeveloped  areas  at  the  urban  fringes  to  vacant  and 
          underutilized  land  within  the  existing  urban  area,  2)  Transit  Oriented  Development/Redevelopment  should be 
          provide  access  to  a  variety  of  transportation  options  and  mix  of  land  uses,  and  3)  Employment  centers  should 
          be  concentrated  near  affordable  housing  and  multiple  modes  of  transportation,  providing  quick  access  to 
          government, service and other support functions.  

          STAR LINE FEASIBILITY STUDY 
          25B




          METRA  is  proposing  an  interconnecting  rail  line  that  links  110  communities  in  the  southwest,  west,  and 
          H        H




          northwest  suburban  regions  of  northeast  Illinois.    The  STAR  Line  fills  a  critical  void  for  intersuburban 
          commuter rail service that will intersect and complement Metra's existing rail lines that currently serve as hub 
          and spoke lines from the City of Chicago to the suburban communities. 
                                                                                                                                            
          The  proposed  interconnection  of  the  CN  (formerly  the  EJ&E)  Railroad  and  the  proposed  Northwest  Corridor 
          Line  that  will  run  from  O'Hare  Airport  along  the  I90  Illinois  Tollway  will  interconnect  at  Prairie  Stone Business 
          Park.  This  interconnection  will  allow  easy  transitions  to  O'Hare  airport  and  into  the  City  of  Chicago  and  with 
          other  rail  lines  that  run  from  Chicago  west  and  southwest.  This  connection  will  access  communities  and 
          industrial  parks  from  Joliet  north  through  Naperville,  Aurora,  West  Chicago,  Bartlett  to  businesses  and 
          residents along the NW Corridor including Hoffman Estates, Schaumburg, Arlington Heights, Rolling Meadows, 
          Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines.  

          The  STAR  Line  would  extend  from  O'Hare  up  to  I90  corridor  to  Prairie  Stone  and  then  bend  southward 
          through  the  western  suburbs  to  Joliet.   Located  at  the  "elbow"  of  the  proposed  route,  Prairie  Stone  will  be  a 
          key  location  along  this  major  regional  transportation  investment.    There  is  currently,  however,  no  transit 
          connectivity to Prairie Stone from the north or west.   

          According  to  Metra,  the  proposed  expansion  of  O'Hare,  alone,  will  result  in  new  economic  output  of  $8$10 
          billion  annually  for  the  region  and  approximately  455,000  new  jobs.    After  the  completion  of  the  STAR  Line 
          Feasibility Study, Metra began, and is still undergoing, an Alternatives Analysis for the STAR Line. 


6.0  PROPOSED TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS

As  noted  in  the  Village's  Comprehensive  Plan,  one  of  their  goals  is  to  provide  safe,  convenient,  and  pleasant  access 
between residential areas, employment districts, and supporting business, education, civic, and leisure activities.  

Infrastructure  improvements  have  been  proposed  by  the  participating  transportation  agencies  in  cooperation  with  the 
Village's goal.

26B       TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS  
          A  lack  of  connection  along  IL  72  between  East  Dundee  and  the  Prairie  Stone  Business  Park  exists  in  the 
          region's  transit  system.  As  previously  mentioned,  PACE bus  service currently  connects East  Dundee  and  Elgin, 
          as  well  as,  express  bus  service  connecting  the  CTA  Blue  Lines  to  Prairie  Stone,  although,  no  transit  service 
          exists  along  IL  72  between  Dundee  Crossings  and  Prairie  Stone.   There  are  several  factors  that  make  adding 
          transit service on this section of IL 72 worthwhile and important.  As mentioned in the Route 72 Corridor Plan, 
          these factors include 

                ·       Residential  Growth  in  the  Northwest  Suburbs:   The  communities  north  and  west  of  East  Dundee  are 
                        seeming  to  become  some  of  the  fastest  growing  communities  in  Northeastern  Illinois,  although 
                        currently  have  limited  transit  service.    Creation  of  a  transit  hub  at  IL  72  and  IL  25  along  with  a 
                        connection along the IL 72 corridor would make transit a residents' transportation option.  
                ·       Employment  Centers  in  the  I90  Corridor:    A  transit  connection  along  IL  72  would  help  connect 
                        employment  centers  between  O'Hare  and  the  Fox  River  (including  Prairie  Stone  Business  Park)  to 
                        growing residential areas.  
                ·       Randall  Road  Commercial  Corridor:    Since  Randall  Road  is  a  fast  growing  commercial  corridor, 
                        transportation investments will be needed for transport to and from the corridor.  A connection along 
                        IL  72  through  East  Dundee  from  Randall  Road  to  Prairie  Stone  would  be  ideal  in  order  to  provide 
                        some support to the commercial development.  
                ·       NonMotorized  Connection  to  Fox  River  Trail:    The  Village  of  East  Dundee  intends  to  create  a 
                        bicycle/pedestrian  connection  between  Dundee  Crossings  and  the  Fox  River  Trail  allowing 
                        communities along the Fox River to utilize this new connection for access to Dundee Crossings.  
                ·       STAR  Line:   The  Prairie  Stone  stop  will  be  a  key  stop  for  the  Village  of  East  Dundee.   Additional  bus 
                        service  along  with  this  major  transportation  investment  from  METRA  (See  Section  below  for  details) 
                        will enhance its value and ridership.   

          METRA   Proposed   Prairie   Stone   Station   (STAR   Line)  

          Metra's proposed STAR Line, which is slated to travel from O'Hare International Airport to the Joliet area, 
          would a station to Prairie Stone.  Plans are underway to locate a station on property and to service this station 
          with an internal shuttle service. Utilization of the CN rail line offers a costeffective northsouth commuter link 
          and access to O'Hare International Airport and into the City of Chicago accessing employees from all over 
          Northeastern Illinois. Federal funding is being sought for this project.    

          Prairie   Stone   TMA   Connection  

          Future endeavors and service improvements are currently being considered.  The TMA identified that there is 
          a missing connection between Prairie Stone and the northwest.  Additional service to the northwest, primarily 
          Lake In The Hills, Crystal Lake, and Huntley, may generate ridership.   After an internal survey, the TMA 
          uncovered that some of the employment centers have approximately 6070% of their employees  traveling 
          from the Rockford area.  Potential transportation service to and from this area would be a future 
          consideration if the area was expanded.

          Pace   Bus   Service   Improvements  

          As  indicated  in  PACE's  Vision  2020  Plan,  express  routes  on  major  roadways  connecting  with  smaller 
          communities  are  proposed.    At  the  existing  Elgin  Regional  Transportation  Center,  four  types  of  Pace  bus 
          service are proposed including: 1) LineHaul Express Routes, 2) LineHaul Arterial Routes, 3) CommunityBased 
          Service Hubs, and 4) Historic Trolley Circulator Hub.  At the existing Community Transportation Center located 
          at  Spring  Hill  Mall  in  West  Dundee,  three  types  of  Pace  bus  service  are  proposed  including:  1)  LineHaul 
          Arterial Routes, 2) CommunityBased Service Hubs, and 3) Historic Trolley Circulator Hub.   

          These  improvements  are  consistent  with  the  Village's  objective  that  they  would  like  to  work  with  Pace  to 
          expand public transportation services and facilities.  

          ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS  
          27B




          As   part   of   the   Village   of   East   Dundee's   Comprehensive   Plan,   includes   the   Transportation   Plan,  
          where   new   roadway   alignments,   bridges   and   traffic   signals   were   proposed.     Since   the  
          Comprehensive   was   published   in   October   2002,   it   is   understandable   that   the   identification   of   a  
          potential   transit   center   was   not   indicated.    Need   to   get   status   of   this   plan   from   Village.   

          As   part   of   the   East   Dundee   Downtown   Plan's   redevelopment   sites   (see   Section   5.0   for   details),  
          transportation   improvements   are   proposed   in   order   to   improve   traffic   circulation.     These  
          improvements   include:   

                    ·    Extend Hill Street 
                    ·    Redirect Water Street 
                    ·    Realign River Street 
                    ·    Enhance Bike Path along River 

          As  part  of  East  Dundee's  Downtown  TIF  Redevelopment  Plan,  the  existing  roadway  network,  particularly,  at 
          the  intersection  of  IL  72  and  River  Street  will  require  new  roadway  infrastructure  to  improve  access  to  the 
          future developments in the Study Area.  (See Section 5.0 for further details on this Plan).   

          Within  the  Village's  2009  Street  Improvement  Program,  are  several  local  road  improvements  proposed  within 
          the next five years.  Of these improvements, none of them are located within the vicinity of Dundee Crossings.  

                Overall  roadway  enhancements  from  the  Route  72  Corridor  Plan  include  enhanced  crosswalks  and  pedestrian 
                pushbutton signals, new street lighting, bus stops/shelters, landscaped medians, and gateway features.  

          Roadway  improvements  are  proposed  as  part  of  the  Dundee  Gateway  development.    These  improvements 
          would  include  extending  IL  68,  adding  turn  lanes  and  installing  curbs  and  gutters.   The  developer  will  initially 
          construct  various  lane  widening,  median  and  pavement  improvements  on  IL  25  and  IL  68,  as  well  as  mass 
          grading, utility and landscape improvements of the 6.5acre development. 

          PEDESTRIAN/BICYCLE ENHANCEMENTS 
          28B




          A  pedestrian  and  bicycle  facility  was  proposed  as  part  of  the  Route  72  Corridor  Plan.   A  commuter  bike  path 
          along IL 72 stretching from the Fox River Trail in downtown East Dundee east to Dundee Crossings commercial 
          area,  and  eventually  east  to  Prairie  Stone  and  the  Sears  headquarters  would  be  an  essential  enhancement  to

RE: Transit Needs Technical Memorandum

1.0
0B              Introduction
 
The  purpose  of  this  technical  memorandum  is  to  review  and  assess  the  potential  needs  and  opportunities  for 
transit  services  in  the  Dundee  Crossings  area  that  would  support  the  planning  and  design  of  a  potential  transit 
facility.    Tasks  in  this  activity  include  developing  information  on  socioeconomic  demographic,  market  data,  land 
use  patterns,  and  existing  and  proposed  transit  service.   This  assessment  was  conducted  using  existing  conditions 
information and data compiled in the Task 1.0 Existing Conditions Summary. 
 
This needs assessment report includes a review of socioeconomic characteristics of the population and journey to 
work  data  (Section  2.0),  major  destinations  and  activity  centers  in  the  study  area  (Section  3.0),  land  use  patterns 
(Section  4.0),  and  existing  and  proposed  transit  service  (Section  5.0)  to  provide  an  understanding  of  the  potential 
transit  market  in  the  Dundee  Crossings  area.    Section  6.0  identifies  potential  transit  routes  to  serve  identified 
transit markets and the potential transit facility.  Section 7.0 provides an evaluation and recommendations. 
 
2.0
1B              Socioeconomic Demographics
 
Socioeconomic  demographics  are  a  primary  indicator  of  potential  need  for  transit.    Conditions  related  to 
population  and  land  use  may  influence  potential  transit  use  by  both  the  transportation  disadvantaged  and  choice 
markets.   These  factors  are  consistent  for  most  U.S.  transit  systems  with  higher  transit  usage  in  areas  with  larger 
populations  and  population  densities.  Other  measures  were  developed  to  determine  the  size  and  location  of 
transportation  dependent  persons  in  the  study  area,  including  persons  with  disabilities,  the  elderly,  lowincome 
households, and households with zero auto ownership. 
 
This  analysis  includes  the  identification  of  potential  transit  riders  in  the  study  area.    Potential  transit  riders  are 
typically comprised of transit dependent riders and choice riders.  Transit dependent riders are those persons who 
rely  on  the  use  of  public  transportation  on  a  regular  basis  for  travel  to  work,  school,  medical,  shopping  and  other 
related  trips.    Transit  dependent  riders  have  few  or  no  other  transportation  options.    Choice  riders  are  those 
persons  that  have  access  to  other  means  of  transportation  (i.e.  private  vehicle)  that  is  readily  available.    Choice 
riders may choose to take transit based on convenience and cost in comparison to driving.  
 
Transit  dependent  riders  possess  specific  demographic  characteristics  such  as  a  lower  income  status,  physical 
and/or  mental  disability,  or  age  (i.e.  elderly  population)  that  may  limit  their  use  of  private  vehicle  transportation. 
In  a  suburban  environment  that  is  primarily  autodependent,  such  as  the  Dundee  Crossings  area,  transit 
dependent  riders  would  be  the  primary  users  of  local  transit  services.     Choice  riders  rely  more  on  transit  as  an 
option, based on issues related to traffic congestion and travel time, population density, and employment location. 
 
This  analysis  provides  a  review  of  transit  needs  in  the  Dundee  Crossings  study  area  identifying  transit  dependent 
populations  based  on  age,  disability,  income,  or  automobile  availability,  based  on  data  derived  from  the  2000  U.S. 
Census Bureau.

Total Population 
U




The  total  population  for  the  Dundee  Crossings  area  communities  was  approximately  284,000  in  2000  and  is 
estimated  to  grow  to  by 20%  to  about  341,000  by 2009  and 369,000 by 2014.   The  communities  that  make up  this 
statistic include:   

        ·   Algonquin                                                          ·      Gilberts 
        ·   Barrington Hills                                                   ·      Huntley 
        ·   Carpentersville                                                    ·      Lake in the Hills 
        ·   Crystal Lake                                                       ·      Lakewood 
        ·   East Dundee                                                        ·      Sleepy Hollow 
        ·   Elgin                                                              ·      West Dundee 
        ·   Hoffman Estates 
 
The  communities  of  Gilberts  and  Huntley  are  projected  to  grow  the  fastest  in  the  region.    Figure  1  displays  the 
total population at a Census tract level. 
 
Population Density 
U




Population  density  is  one  variable  that  measures  potential  transit  needs.   The  denser  the  population,  the  greater 
the  likelihood  there  is  for  increased  ridership  from  potential  transit  dependent  and  choice  riders.    Most  of  the 
population density is centered within Elgin.  Figure 2 displays the population density in the study area. 
 
Elderly Population 
U




The  elderly  population  is  another  potential  market  to  use  transit  service.   Elderly  is  considered  persons  65  years 
and  older  by  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau.   The  elderly  often  do  not  drive  or  have  access  to  a  vehicle  due  to  physical 
limitations  and  growing  dependence  on  family  and  caregivers.     Availability  and  access  to  transit  services  provide 
elderly  individuals  opportunities  to  make  trips  related  to  health  care,  social  services,  shopping,  errands,  and 
community activities.  Figure 3 displays the elderly population in the study area. 
 
Disabled Persons 
U




Persons  with  disabilities  have  a  high  rate  of  usage  of  both  fixed  and  paratransit  (i.e.  doortodoor)  services.  Figure 
4 provides a map of the disabled population for Year 2000, which includes all disabled persons above the age of 16 
years that have mental, physical, selfcare, sensory, employment, or a gooutsideof home disability. 
 
Median Household Income 
U




Median  household  income  is  an  important  indication  in  determining  transit  dependence.  Median  household 
income divides households into two equal segments with the first half of households earning less than the median 
household  income  and  the  other half  earning  more.  Figure  5  shows  the median household  income throughout  the 
study area.   
 
Zero Auto Households 
U




Concentrations  of  households  with  no  autos  are  vital  in  identifying  potential  transit  needs.  Persons  with  no  access 
to  a  vehicle  must  rely  on  alternate  modes  of  transportation  such  as  walking,  biking,  carpooling,  taxis  and  public 
transportation  to  access  employment,  shopping  and  other  related  trips.  Figure  6  provides  a  percentage  of  zero 
auto ownership for all households.

Kane  County  captures  a  majority  of  its  residents  that  live  and  work  within  the  county.    More  residents  leave  Kane 
County  for  jobs  in  neighboring  counties,  than  workers  that  travel  to  Kane  County  from  other  counties.    Mode 
choice is mostly autooriented with average travel times reported the lowest in Kane County.  This could be due to 
a  higher  portion  of  internal  commuting  trips  and  shorter  work  trips  being  made  to  neighboring  communities, 
compared to other counties in the region.

2B        Major Destinations and Activity Centers
 
Key  activity  generators  were  identified  including  senior  and  affordable  housing  communities,  postsecondary 
schools,  major  employment  centers  and  shopping  centers.  Below  is  an  analysis  of  existing  transit  coverage  and 
unmet  needs  that  present  opportunities  for  additional  transit  service.   Data  was  analyzed  based  on  the  Task  1.0 
Existing Conditions Summary, which was compiled from ESRI Business Analyst and S.B. Friedman & Company. 
 
Affordable and Senior Housing Communities 
U




Elderly  and  low  income  individuals  typically  rely  on  transit  for  access  from  concentrated  housing  communities  to 
social  centers,  shopping,  medical  services  and  jobs.   Thirteen  large  senior  housing  communities  containing  1,429 
units  and  thirteen  affordable  housing  communities  containing  999  units  are  located  in  the  study  area.   Based  on 
existing  transit  service,  only  one  community  (in  Algonquin)  is  greater  than  0.75  miles  from  an  existing  Pace  bus 
route.      Fixed  route  bus  service  receiving  federal  funding  for  operations  is  required  by  law,  to  be  paired  with 
complementary Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit service, which Pace provides. 
 
PostSecondary Schools 
U




Students  are  another  potential  transit  user  for  trips  related  to  schools.    Elgin  Community  College  and  Judson 
University  are  the  main  postsecondary  schools  located  in  the  area,  with  enrollment,  faculty  and  staff  totaling 
approximately 14,400.  Pace Bus Routes 543 and 552 currently serve both universities. 
 
Major Employment Centers 
U




Job  access  is  key  for  both  transit  dependent  and  choice  riders.    Areas  with  a  high  concentration  of  employment 
are  candidates  for  transit  services  to  access  those  businesses.    Within  the  study  area,  clustered  employment 
centers  containing  businesses  that  employ  100  or  more  individuals  per  business,  and  single  employers  of  500  or 
more  per  businesses  were  identified.  These  include  Prairie  Stone  Business  Park  (including  Sears  and  Kmart),  St. 
Alexius  Medical  Center,  Sherman  Hospital,  Spring  Hill  Mall,  Crystal  Point  Mall  and  other  areas  adjacent  to  major 
transportation  corridors.   A  majority  of  business  centers  are  currently  served  by  either  Pace  or  Metra.   There  are 
clusters  of  employment  on Randall  Road  in Algonquin  and  Lake  in  the  Hills  and  an  employment  center  adjacent  to 
IL Route 47 in Huntley that currently are not served by transit.  
 
Shopping Centers 
U




Transit  is  important  to  provide  access  to  individuals  without  means  of  other  forms  of  transportation  to  buy  goods 
and  access  services.  Major  shopping  centers  in  the  area  include  Algonquin  Commons,  Randall  Crossing,  and 
Algonquin  Galleria  on  Randall  Road;  Spring  Hill  Mall;  The  Arboretum  of  South  Barrington;  and  Popular  Creek 
Crossing.  With the exception of Spring Hill Mall, these shopping centers do not have direct access to transit.

3B        Land Use Patterns
 
The  development  and  land  use  patterns  in  the  study  area  are  traditional  of  a  suburban  environment  with 
population  and  employment  shifting  from  denser  city  centers  to  low  density  developments.   These  patterns  have 
supported  more  automobile  oriented  transportation  usage.   Public  transportation  operators  have  tried  to  provide 
expanded services to effectively serve these areas.  With the exception of the core areas of the older communities 
and  larger  satellite  cities  (i.e.  Elgin),  most  of  the  service  area  consists  of  new  subdivisions  and  dispersed 
employment  centers.    There  are  many  land  uses  scattered  throughout  the  study  area  that  are  common  in 
suburban  areas.    With  the  potential  to  redevelop  the  area  around  IL  Routes  25  and  72,  there  could  be  an 
opportunity  to  create  a  more  mixed  land  use  with  additional  employment  centers  and  higher  density 
developments that may encourage more transit usage in the area. 
 
The  Pace  Development  Guidelines  manual  provides  direction  for  new  developments  that  encourages  transit
oriented design that would, in turn, improve job accessibility.

                                                                  Suite 900                         Fax (773) 380-7979
                                                                  Chicago, Illinois, 60631-3223     www.hdrinc.com
These  guidelines  are  designed  by  Pace  to  compliment  local  zoning  codes  and  land  use  requirements  to  encourage 
the reduction of traffic congestion and mitigate regional development.  The benefits to transit users include: 
 
     · Enhanced access to transit by the pedestrian and mobility limited population  
     · Improved passenger convenience and comfort  
     · Increased accessibility to needed services and work places by public transportation  
     · Increased travel alternatives  

Residential,  retail,  office,  mixeduse  and  industrial  land  uses  are  encouraged  to  provide  design  and  access 
treatments  that  promote  the  use  of  transit.   The  design of  roadways,  sidewalks  and  other  supporting  facilities  (i.e. 
bicycle  routes  and  park  and  ride  facilities)  are  essential  to  support  transit  within  and  connecting  to  different  land 
use types.

4B        Existing and Proposed Transit Services
 
It  is  important  to  understand  the  existing  transit  service  in  order  to  determine  areas  of  deficiency  and 
opportunities  for  connections  to  areas  that  currently  do  not  have  transit  service.      Transit  services  that  are 
currently  provided  in  the  study  area  include  Metra  Commuter  Rail  and  Pace  Bus  (local  and  express  service)  and 
sponsored vanpools, as identified in the Task 1.0 Existing Conditions Summary. 
 
Existing Transit Services 
U




There  are  more  than  20  Pace  bus  routes  that  serve  the  area,  with  two  of  these  routes  (Routes  543  and  803)  that 
are  directly  adjacent  to  the  potential  sites  for  a  transit  center.   Pace  offers  three  express  bus  routes  (Routes  610, 
1012,  and  767)  to  Prairie  Stone  Business  Park  and  provides  vanpool  service  through  the  Prairie  Stone 
Transportation  Management  Association  (TMA),  which  sponsors  employee  carpooling  programs.   Metra  provides 
commuter  rail  service  in  the  regional  study  area  including  the  Union  Pacific  Northwest  Line  and  Milwaukee  West 
Line,  with  the  closest  stations  in  Barrington,  Fox  River  Grove  and  Elgin.   As  part  of  the  transit  analysis,  operating 
characteristics  (i.e.  span  of  service  and  service  frequency)  and  existing  ridership  were  documented  to  determine 
the  need  and  potential  characteristics  of  new  local  and  circulator  routes  to  serve  the  potential  transit  center  and 
areas with unmet service.  Table 5 provides a summary of existing transit service adjacent to the Dundee Crossings 
site  and  details  regarding  operating  characteristics.    Pace's  current  bus  route  provides  service  for  the  transit 
dependent populations in the area.   
 
Pace  currently has  two  transit  centers  in  the  study  area  as transfer  points  for  local  buses.   The  Elgin  Transit  Center 
functions  as  a  regional  bustobus  transfer  center  with  13  local  bus  routes  that  feed  into  the  facility.   This  transit 
center  also  provides  a  direct  connection  to  Greyhound  and  Metra,  with  the  Elgin  Station  directly  adjacent  to  the 
facility.   The  Prairie  Stone  Transit  Center  is  closest  to  the  potential  Dundee  Crossings  Transit  Center.   This  transit 
center  serves  more  as  a  terminus  location  for  the  three  Pace  express  bus  routes  that  provide  direct  service  to 
Prairie Stone. 
 
Proposed Transit Services 
U




Two  major  transit  projects  are  proposed  near  the  Dundee  Crossings  study  area.    The  STAR  Line  is  a  proposed 
commuter  rail  line  along  the  CN/ElginJolietEastern  (CN/EJ&E)  railroad  and  I90  corridor,  with  a  potential  station 
adjacent  to  Prairie  Stone.    A  Pace  Bus  Rapid  Transit  (BRT)  is  also  being  proposed  along  Randall  Road  south  of 
Interstate 90 with a potential to expand the BRT north on Randall Road into Crystal Lake.  While both the STAR line 
and the future expansion of the BRT north of Interstate 90 present opportunities for greater transit connectivity in 
the  northwest  suburban  region,  it  may  not  fully  justify  a  transfer  center  in  East  Dundee.  Task  1.0  Existing 
Conditions  Summary  discussed  the  potential  of  an  East  Dundee  transit  center  to  function  as  a  transfer  point  for 
commuters  traveling  to  Elgin  and  Prairie  Stone.  The  presence  of  the  BRT  north  extension  would  not  allow  the 
Dundee  Crossings  area  to  reasonably  serve  as  a  transfer  point  for  far  northwest  suburban  commuters  traveling  to 
Elgin. However, the presence of the BRT and STAR Line could strengthen the feasibility of a bus route through East

Dundee. A bus IL along Route 72 connecting the north extension of the BRT to Prairie Stone and the potential STAR 
Line  station  could  be  established.  This  route  would  likely  warrant  a  stop  in  the  Dundee  Crossings  area  at  a 
minimum.  The  potential  for  a  transit  center  would  greatly  depend  on  the  ridership  of  this  line  and  the  need  to 
transfer to other existing and potential routes at or near Dundee Crossings.

5B        New Transit Concepts
 
This  section  of  the  report  documents  general  operating  assumptions  and  concepts  for  potential  bus  routes  that  could  serve  the  Dundee  Crossings  study  area. 
Potential  routes  are  based  on  existing  service  levels  and  geographic  gaps  in  transit  service.   While  transit  dependent  populations  were  considered,  emphasis 
was placed on identifying gaps in transit service. 
 
Existing  local  bus  services  in  the  Dundee  Crossings  study  area  are  operated  by  Pace.   It  is  assumed  that  Pace  would  be  the  operating  agency  for  the  potential 
bus routes. These assumptions include span of service, vehicle capacity, vehicle performance, and operating characteristics. 
 
HuntleyDundee Route   
U




A  potential  new  fixed  bus  route  could  be  established  to  connect  the  growing  northwest  communities  to  Dundee  Crossings  area  and  to  employment  centers  in 
Kane County (i.e. downtown Elgin) and Prairie Stone.  Currently, there is no existing fixed route transit that directly serves Huntley and Gilberts.  This potential 
route  could  fill  the  gap  in  transit  service  for  this  area.   The  potential  route  would  begin  in  downtown  Huntley  and  proceed  south  on  IL  Route  47.   The  route 
would  continue  east  on  Freeman  Road  and  provide  bus  service  for  employees  and  shoppers  to  the  Prime  OutletsHuntley  shopping  center.  The  route  would 
proceed south on Galligan Road to the center of Gilberts.  The route would then proceed east on Higgins Rd. (IL Route 72).  The potential route would provide 
service  to  the  newer  residential  development  of  Gilberts  Town  Center,  Northwest  Corporate  Park  (adjacent  to  IL  Route  72  and  Randall  Road),  Spring  Hill  Mall, 
West  Dundee  and  East  Dundee.    The  potential  route  would  terminate  at  Dundee  Crossings.    Transfer  opportunities  would  exist  to  connect  to  the  existing 
Routes 543, 552 and 803 and the proposed Randall Road BRT.  Figure 7 displays the alignment of the potential route. 
 
Prairie Stone Circulator 
U




Establishing  a  circulator  bus  route  connecting  Prairie  Stone  to  Dundee  Crossings  could  potentially  be  supported.   This  route  would  provide  better  connected 
transit  service for  employees of  Prairie  Stone  to  other parts  of  the  surrounding  area.   The  route  would begin  at  Dundee  Crossings and proceed  east  on  Higgins 
Rd.  (IL  Route  72).   The  route  would  circulate  in  the  Prairie  Stone  site  and  provide  a  direct  connection to  the  existing  Prairie  Stone  Transit  Center,  including  the 
proposed  STAR  Line  station,  then  proceed  east  to  provide  service  for  workers  and  shoppers  at  the  Arboretum  at  South  Barrington.      Figure  7  displays  the 
alignment of the potential route. 
 




                                                                                                                                                                                         16
 
Span of Service 
U




The  span  of  service  for 
the  potential  bus 
routes  should  be 
comparable  to  the 
weekday,  Saturday  and 
Sunday  and  holiday 
schedules  for  the 
existing  bus  routes  in 
the  service  area.   There 
would  not  be  service 
provided  on  Sundays 
and  holidays  to  be 
consistent  with  the 
current  Pace  local  bus 
service  in  the  study 
area.    Table  6  below, 
summarizes              the 
assumed  span  of 
service.

Service  frequencies  for  the  potential  routes  are  assumed  to  be  comparable  to  the  existing  bus  service  for  consistency  and  connectivity  for  transfers.   Table  7 
below, summarizes the assumed service frequency.

Vehicle Capacity and Passenger Load Standards 
10BU




A  40  foot  bus  is  recommended  for  the  new  bus  service,  based  on  Pace's  current  bus  fleet.    Vehicle  capacity  and  passenger  loading  standards  have  been 
established  in  order  to  determine  the  service  frequency  and  fleet  requirements  for  the  new  local  bus  routes.    Table  8,  summarizes  the  assumed  vehicle 
capacity (seats) and passenger loading standards.

Operating Requirements 
1BU




Operating  plans  were  developed  to  determine  the  operating  requirements  for  the  potential  routes.   The  operating  requirements  were  estimated  based  on  a 
similar  level  of  service  (i.e.  service  hours  and  frequencies)  for  existing  Pace  routes  in  the  study  area.      Estimating  operating  requirements  assists  a  transit 
operator  with  estimating  the  potential  costs  to  operate  and  maintain  new  service.   Costs  are  typically  driven  by  the  number  of  buses,  annual  busmiles  and 
annual bushours required to operate the new routes.  Tables 10 and 11 provide the detailed operating requirements. 
 
Potential Ridership 
U




Many  factors  influence  ridership  for  transit  including:  land  use  patterns,  socioeconomic  demographic  factors,  access  to  transit,  service  frequency,  span  of 
service  and  quality  of  service.   Estimated  ridership  for  the  potential  bus  routes  is  assumed  to  be  comparable  to  ridership  of  the  existing  routes  in  the  service 
area due to similar route characteristics (i.e. coverage, span of service, service frequency).  Based on the average daily ridership of the existing local fixedroute 
bus service, Pace Routes 543,  552, and 803 for 2008, the potential ridership can be estimated.  The average daily ridership for the existing routes is 360 riders.  
By  applying  a  factor  for  the  percent  in  population  change  for  the  area  for  2009  through  2014,  the  potential  ridership  could  be  440  daily  riders  by  2014  for  the 
potential new routes.  The percent population change estimated for the area is 23 percent for Gilberts, Huntley, Sleepy Hollow, East Dundee and West Dundee.  
Potential  ridership  may  also  be  projected  by  using  the  existing  AADT  for  IL  Route  72  and  applying  a  2  percent  factor  for  mode  shift.    However,  the  value 
obtained from this method is approximately 580 riders, considerably higher than the existing ridership on established routes in the area.   
 
Future  land  use  and  other  proposed  transit  improvements  would  have  some  impact  on  the  ridership  of  the  potential  routes.   Ridership  for  transit  routes  that 
would  utilize  a  potential  Dundee  Crossing  Transit  Center  will  also  depend  on  the  redevelopment  and  employment  generated  in  the  area  surrounding  the 
center.   
 
Bus Bay Requirements 
U




The  number  of  bus  bays  is  important  take  into  account  when  designing  a  bus  transfer  facility.   The  amount  is  typically  based  on  the  frequency  of  bus  service, 
scheduling of bus arrivals (i.e. timed transfers), need for operator layovers for terminating routes, and number of routes that pass through the facility (inbound 
and outbound travel).  Pace determines the number and location of bus bays at transfer center, based on service volume and transfer needs.  The bus bay size 
should  be  at  least  50  feet  in  order  to  accommodate  a  40foot  bus.   There  would  be  a  total  of  4  routes  that  would  serve  the  Dundee  Crossings  area,  which 
includes the existing Routes 543 and 803 and the two potential routes.  It would need to be determined by Pace if the existing route alignments and schedules 
would be restructured to terminate and layover at a proposed transit facility.  It is recommended to assign one bus bay for each terminating route with a peak 

                                                                                                                                                                                       19
period  service  frequency  of  30minutes  or  less.   Four  bus  bays  are  recommended  to  accommodate  existing  and  proposed  bus  routes  and  provide  additional 
capacity for future bus routes that would serve a transit facility.  Table 9 provides recommended bus bay assignments.

6B        Transit Need Evaluation
 
Based  on  the  above  analysis,  there  are  opportunities  for  new  transit  service  to  support  a  Dundee  Crossings  transit 
facility.   The  results  identified  that  existing  Pace  local  bus  service  provides  coverage  to  areas  and  populations  that 
support transit usage. Pace currently serves the area's transit dependent populations.  There are opportunities for 
expanded service in growing areas of populations and expanded industrial businesses in the area that are unserved 
by  transit  at  this  time.   There  are  also  identified  constraints  with  the  limited  existing  demand  source  from  Prairie 
Stone  and  Metra  stations  to  serve  the  transit  center.  An  evaluation  matrix  was  developed  to  evaluate  potential 
transit routes on the measures to determine transit need.

8B        Conclusion
 
Current  population,  projected  population  growth,  and  geographic  gaps  in  transit  service  could  support  up  to  two 
new  bus  routes  in  the  area.   The  proposed  routes  would  link  the  northwest  suburbs  to  Dundee  Crossings,  Prairie 
Stone, and potentially the Metra STAR Line Station via Route 72.  Additional public transit in the Dundee Crossings 
area would have the benefit of relieving congestion at the intersection of Route 72 and Route 25, and of providing 
opportunities  to  link  future  economic  development  opportunities  and  other  activity  generators  at  Dundee 
Crossings  into  the  regional  transportation  network.    Future  strategic  development  sites  at  Dundee  Crossings 
should be planned to enable transit accessibility, allowing for bus ingress and egress and clear drop off locations as 
well as appropriate building locations and layouts.  Future land uses at Dundee Crossings and population growth in 
the  northwest  suburbs  could  warrant  a  smallerscale  transit  center  in  this  area  within  on  of  these  strategic 
development  sites  accommodating  up  to  6  buses  during  peak  hours  along  with  other  transportationsupportive 
facilities for parkandride users, bicyclists and pedestrians.

Within  the  next  steps  of  the  planning  study,  the  consultant  team  will  further  examine  the  key  strategic 
development  locations  with  the  Dundee  Crossings  area  and  develop  plans  that  will  support  transit  access  and 
development.   The  development  plans  will  include  accommodations  for  existing  bus  transit  in  the  area  and  short 
term  demand  as  well  as  flexible  capacity  to  accommodate  additional  transit  service  that  may  result  from  future 
development activity and demand with the immediate area and the subregion.

Memorandum


From: Charles H. Teuer, PE                                       Date: September 23, 2009

Subject: Dundee Crossings Existing Conditions Traffic Analysis



SUMMARY
This memorandum presents the findings of traffic analyses conducted as part of the planning for a
multimodal center to be located in the Village of East Dundee, Illinois. As shown in Figure 1, the
study area included the intersections of Illinois State Route 25 (IL 25) with Illinois State Route 72
(IL 72) and Illinois State Route 68 (IL 68) as well as the intersection of IL 72 and IL 68.

STUDY METHODOLOGY
Peak hour turning-movement counts were conducted at the intersection of IL 25/IL 72 on Tuesday,
September 9, 2009, from 6:00 to 9:00 AM and from 3:30 to 6:30 PM. The intersections of IL 68
with IL 25 and IL 72 were conducted from 6:30 to 8:30 AM and from 4:00 to 6:00 PM on Tuesday
and Wednesday, September 15 and 16, 2009, respectively. The two-hour periods of these latter two
counts match the observed peak period of the former three-hour counts. The data was analyzed
using Synchro and SimTraffic to assess existing Level of Service (LOS).

EXISTING CONDITIONS
RWA conducted a field reconnaissance to collect relevant information pertaining to adjacent land
uses, the surrounding roadway network, traffic controls, and existing traffic volumes on IL 25, IL 72
and IL 68. The land uses within the study area vary from residential to commercial and retail in
addition to the existing and former quarry sites.

Roadway Network
Illinois State Route 25 is a north-south arterial with a five-lane cross section of two lanes in each
direction separated by a raised or painted median which accommodates left turn lanes at
intersections and driveways. IL 25 is designated a Strategic Regional Arterial (SRA) by the Illinois
Department of Transportation (IDOT) south of IL 68. The roadway, which extends to Elgin and
Aurora, has an interchange with the Interstate 90 Northwest Tollway (I-90) to the south of the study
area. To the north, IL 25 provides connections to Carpentersville, Algonquin, Crystal Lakes and
other northwest suburbs. IL 25 has an Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volume of 25,400 vpd
(vehicles per day) for the year 2007 within the study area. The posted speed limit is 45 miles per
hour (mph).

Illinois State Route 72 is an east-west arterial that is oriented slightly southeast and northwest with
a five-lane cross section of two lanes in each direction divided by a median that accommodates left-
turn lanes at intersections and driveways. IL 72 is designated as an SRA east of IL 25. To the east,
the roadway provides connections to Prairie Business Park, Schaumburg and other regional arterials
including IL 59. IL 72 joins with IL 68 in the western portion of the study area and provides access
to West Dundee, Springhill Mall and an interchange with I-90 further west. The AADT for 2007
was 29,000 vpd. The posted speed limit varies from 30 mph in the western portion of the study area
to 40 mph in the eastern portion

Illinois State Route 68 is an east-west arterial that is oriented slightly northeast and southwest.
Within the study area, IL 68 generally has one lane in each direction divided by a drivable median
with residential driveways on either side of the street. East of IL 25, the roadway operates as a two-
lane undivided highway. To the east, the roadway provides connections to Barrington, Palatine and
other northern suburbs. The AADT for 2007 was 13,700 vpd. The posted speed limit is 35 mph.

Field Observations
RWA made field observations during the week of September 7, 2009. Key observations included:
   1. Access management features, such as frontage roads for access to residential streets, are in
       place along IL 25. This is indicative of this roadway's SRA status and the desire to limit the
       number of intersections along the main roadway.
   2. Limited pedestrian accommodations exist within the study intersections and along much of
       the study roadways, especially IL 25 and IL 72. Pedestrians were observed walking along
       the roadside where sidewalks did not exists.
   3. Queuing at the study intersections was generally processed within one signal cycle except for
       the IL 72/IL 68 intersection. Queuing from signals on IL 72 to the west of IL 68 had the
       tendency to back through this intersection, especially in the PM peak hours.
   4. The resurfacing of IL 25 south of IL 72 was completed prior to conducting the data collection
       and field observations.
   5. At the time of these counts, the planned Thornton Gas Station development, to be located on
       the southeast corner of IL 25 and IL 68, was under construction. The construction activity
       did not include any lane closures and did not appear to materially influence traffic patterns.

Existing Traffic
RWA collected peak hour turning-movement volumes at the study intersections as described above.
The set of count data is included in Appendix A. The peak hours at the intersection occurred from
7:00 AM to 8:00 AM and from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM for the AM and PM peak hours, respectively.
Figure 2 indicates the existing lane configurations at the study intersections and Figure 3 shows the
existing traffic volumes. The recorded 15-minute Peak Hour Factors for all intersections were 0.95
or greater, on average. This indicates that throughout the peak hour, traffic is fairly consistent. A
closer look at the data indicates that the traffic volume levels actually continue out side of the peak
hour, both earlier and later. In other words, the traffic "peak" experienced in the study area is more
of a plateau that lasts 60 to 90 minutes.

One observation of note is the consistency of traffic volumes from one intersection to the next along
IL 25 and IL 72. In general, the volumes in a given direction from one intersection were within 10%
of the volumes at the next intersection, suggesting that a large percentage of the traffic within the
study area is through traffic as opposed to traffic destined to or originating from the land uses within
the study area. This is consistent with anecdotal evidence received from the Steering Committee and
the Village. It is also consistent with the expected function of these regional routes as well as the
existing level and type of development in the study area. Along IL 68, approximately 40% to 50%
(during the AM and PM, respectively) of the traffic is generated from between the intersections with
IL 72 and IL 25. This traffic generation is likely associated with Barrington Avenue and other
residential streets and driveways along IL 68 in this area.

The percentage of truck traffic at the study intersections averaged at typical levels of 2% or less,
except for a decidedly higher percentage from the east on IL 72 in the morning peak hours. For
example, trucks accounted for 17.9% of all westbound traffic turning left from IL 72 to southbound
IL 25 during the three-hour morning traffic count. Nine percent of right-turning traffic was trucks.
This higher-than-typical percentage of trucks could be attributed to ongoing quarry activity and the
construction of the Terra Business Park to the east on IL 72.

Pedestrian and bicycle activity was observed mainly at the intersection of IL 25/IL 68, but volumes
were minor.

Directional Distribution of Traffic
Distinct directional volume patterns exist at each of the study intersections that differ inversely
between the AM and PM. In the AM, the predominant traffic flow directions are eastbound and
southbound with the opposite true in the PM. In this area, Illinois Route 72 appears to operate as an
alternative for drivers to the Illinois Tollway with significant east-west traffic patterns during the
peak hours. IL 25 operates as a significant north-south roadway in the region as perceived from the
traffic volumes and from the percentage of vehicles turning onto IL 25 from both IL 68 and IL 72.

Expected Traffic Growth
With the downturn in the economy that began in 2006, significant development within or adjacent to
the study area is not expected in the near future. One development mentioned previously, the
Thornton Gas Station, is currently under construction. While the traffic study for this development
was not available for review at the time of this analysis, the station and an associated convenience
store that is assumed to be part of the development may increase traffic volumes, especially turning
movements, at the IL 25/IL 68 intersection. However, much of the traffic associated with the
development is expected to be pass-by or diverted trip traffic. This development is not expected to
significantly increase the number of vehicles on the study roadways, but merely to add some turning
movements and slightly shift some patterns.

A request is being submitted to the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) for traffic
growth forecasts within the study area. The expected response will provide the Team with traffic
projections for the study roadways in the year 2030, the current horizon year for CMAP forecasts.
The counts will be based on projected population trends, development patterns and assumed
regionally-significant transportation network improvements as described in CMAP's 2030 Regional
Transportation Plan which was originally adopted in 2003 and last updated in October 2008.

CAPACITY ANALYSIS
Intersection capacity analyses were conducted at the study intersections for the AM and PM peak
hour Existing Conditions to determine a Level of Service (LOS). Operational LOS reflects delays
experienced by the motorist and are measured from A through F. LOS A is the best and LOS F the
worst, which is considered a failed condition. LOS D or better is considered to be within acceptable
limits.

The capacity analyses results are tabulated below. Detailed worksheets are included in Appendix B.

The capacity analysis shows that the intersection of IL 25 and IL 72 operates at unacceptable levels
during the morning peak hour. The remaining time periods at the study intersections operate at
acceptable levels with the exception of the eastbound approach of the IL 25/IL 68 intersection. A
closer review of that intersection approach indicated that the key movement during that time period
is the eastbound left turn to northbound IL 25.

CONCLUSIONS
The above analysis of existing conditions resulted in the following findings:
   1. IL 72 is the most trafficked of the study roadways, serving as an alternative to I-90 for
       commuters.
   2. IL 72 operates near or above capacity which results in an extension of peak hour traffic
       volume levels that continue for 60 to 90 minutes.
   3. IL 25 is the second-most trafficked of the study roadways serving regional north-south
       commuting traffic.
   4. IL 68 serves much of the residential development in the study area.
   5. The study intersections operate at acceptable levels of service during weekday peak hours
       with the following exceptions:
           a. The intersection of IL 25/IL 72 operates below acceptable levels during the AM and
              PM peak hours, and;
           b. The eastbound approach to the intersection of IL 25/IL 68 operates below acceptable
              levels during the PM peak hour.
   6. Regional commuting traffic, through traffic not associated with East Dundee, appears to be
       the dominant travel type on the study roadways during peak hours.
   7. Existing pedestrian and bicycle activity was not found to be significant.

NEXT STEPS
The above existing conditions assessment will be taken forward through the planning process. The
existing traffic patterns and Levels of Service that are experienced on the roadways will be used to
assist in the development of future opportunities for a multimodal center. Alternatives that are
developed will be evaluated assuming these existing patterns and expected future growth and
changed traffic patterns.

Subject:         Summary of Public Input


On January 25th, S. B. Friedman & Company and the Lakota Group presented concept plans for
the Dundee Crossings study area to board members, property owners, residents, and other local
stakeholders in East Dundee. An overall conceptual plan centered on the intersection of Route 72
and Route 25 was presented that included the layout of buildings and structures that were
supportive of both existing and future public transit as well as pedestrian activity.

East of Route 25, industrial is the predominant land use north and south of Route 72. Other land
uses of notable mention in this area include the repositioning of the existing Wal-Mart, pockets
for service parks, and a potential hotel. West of Route 25, a senior campus including senior
housing, a medical office center, and commercial/retail use was presented as an option north of
Route 72, while south of Route 72 displayed a "town center" concept that includes residential
and commercial/retail use. The Village's Cook County parcel east on Route 72 included a public
safety campus which consists of an indoor and outdoor regional-level training facility for police,
fire, and other first responder occupations.

The community was encouraged to ask questions and comment on the concept plans presented.
Generally, the feedback was favorable but there were some general questions and concerns about
the need for and access to healthcare services in the area. The following is a compilation of
commentary from the meeting attendees:

Senior/Medical Campus: Northwest corner of Route 72 and 25

      ·   There is general support for expanded healthcare facilities in town.
      ·   There is support for targeting the healthcare industry in East Dundee but a location near a
          hospital may make more sense.
      ·   There is general concern that hospitals are too far away from East Dundee, especially
          now with the relocation of Sherman Hospital.

Commercial/Retail plans south of Route 72

   ·   There is interest in seeing other options for big-box stores.
   ·   The owner of the Santa's Village property is interested in other possible development
       options.

Other Commentary

   ·   The STAR line commuter train line would create synergy for new land uses and activity
       in the area.
   ·   More direct public transit to downtown and O'Hare would be great for existing residents
       and new residential development.
   ·   Transit loops may not have capacity for three buses but pedestrian access is important
       since it is difficult crossing Routes 72 and 25. Bus shelters at the stops and other
       pedestrian amenities would be desirable.
   ·   There is support for a bus route extending to Huntley and bringing people southeast to the
       study area and possibly further to Prairie Stone and Schaumburg.
   ·   There is interest in more direct bus routes between East Dundee and Elgin.


Next Steps
Per our revised scope, the consultant team will work with you and other designated individuals to
develop a preferred concept plan that includes the approved development alternatives and a
circulation and access overlay plan for bus transit. The plan will be circulated amongst the
representatives of the Village for review and comment. Once all of the necessary revisions are
complete, the preferred plan will be presented to the community via a second public meeting.

INTRODUCTION
The Village of East Dundee has prioritized four key parcels within the "Dundee Crossings Corridor" for future redevelopment. These sites, if appropri-
ately planned, will provide the Village the ability to capture new business, light industrial, retail and residential development ­ thereby enhancing the
built environment along Rtes 25 and 72, attracting new businesses and services to the community and benefitting the fiscal condition of the Village.

The development and design guidelines laid out in this document are intended to provide Village decision makers, stakeholders and citizens with
a template of sound design principles that can be brought to bear on these key parcels in order to maximize the market opportunity each is best
suited to capture. As such, these Guidelines are not intended to establish `pre-set' land or building plans, but are to be used to help analyze specific
plans for development as they are presented for these sites so that they maintain consistency with the community's goals and aspirations: to attract
vibrant new development for the jobs, tax revenues and aesthetic benefit of East Dundee that are accessible by multiple modes of transportation.

Goals and Objectives
These guidelines outline the parameters for a sustainable, context-sensitive and market-driven development vision and address three primary goals
for the Dundee Crossing Transit Center area:
          · Promote use of transit
          · Create housing and employment opportunities
          · Create an implementable vision

Purpose
These guidelines are intended as tools for communicating the design intent for future development and for evaluating proposals presented to the
Village. The overall goal is to ensure high-quality development that employs sound planning and design principles. Implementation of these guide-
lines will reinforce the Dundee Crossings image as an inviting place to live, work, shop, and gather. These guidelines are intended to:
            · Guide decision-making on the part of the Village of East Dundee
            · Provide `predictability' for developers in evaluating investment options
            · Help insure that the vision and aspirations of the Village are achieved (and not compromised along the way)

Organization
These guidelines are organized around the key physical elements that promote the use of transit:
         1. Transit Planning
         2. Access and Circulation
         3. Site Development
         4. Buildings
         5. Wayfinding

Use of the Guidelines
These guidelines are designed to be used by the Village and participating agencies such as Pace and IDOT when reviewing proposed development
plans; by existing and potential residents, business owners, and employees when comparing Dundee Crossings to other locations; and by planners,
architects and landscape architects when implementing the Village's vision.

1. TRANSIT PLANNING
Key Principles
      The key planning principles for successful transit-oriented development are:



      Customer orientation
      Focus on making transit a convenient, comfortable and safe choice for customers.



      Mix and Density of Uses
      Support the use of transit by creating a lively sense of community with diverse services, jobs, and
      destinations.



      Walkability
      Create attractive places and establish reasonable distances for users to walk to and from transit to their
      final destination.

1.1 Transit Routes
Existing and proposed expansion of transit routes should be clearly identified with enhanced signage and shelters, along with information about
how the routes interconnect with one another.

1.2 Transit Amenities
No matter where transit riders start their trip or where they are headed, they look for convenience, reliability, economy, security, safety and com-
fort. To accommodate riders in these areas, the implementation of the following tasks should be considered:
           · Locate transit stops within a ¼ mile walk of customers' origins and destinations
           · Provide and publish reliable transit service schedules
           · Remind customers that using transit saves [them] money and conserves natural resources
           · Train transit operators to address security concerns at transit stops and on vehicles
           · Make transit stops safe for customers by providing clear lines of sight and lighting
           · Provide ADA-accessible weather protection and seating at all stops
           · Provide clean and well-maintained vehicles

1.3 Supportive Land Use
The key to transit-oriented development is making transit and walking a more convenient and appealing alternative to driving.

Mixed-use development generates transit riders by emphasizing the pedestrian environment without sacrificing convenient auto access for those
who choose or need to drive. Retail stores and services on a major street can capture much of the transit-riding market by ensuring that the mix of
businesses serves riders' needs, acknowledges their time constraints, and provides an attractive environment for customers.

Higher-density residential development in proximity to transit with a mix of unit types can reinforce a strong sense of identity and community
through direct, safe, and attractive connections to transit.

Non-retail activities including industrial, office, schools, colleges, medical centers, and cultural facilities each require transit service. These compa-
nies and institutions have the opportunity to coordinate development with transit service in order to improve access for their employees, custom-
ers, visitors and at the same time reduce congestion and duplication of private transportation services such as parking shuttles.

In summary, the key transit-supportive land use principals are:
        · Locate the most intense development (building density and number of users) close to the transit stops
        · Provide a continuity of retail and other pedestrian-serving uses along the sidewalk on major streets
        · Take advantage of the number of users and activate the street by locating convenience shops and service uses adjacent to the transit
             stops and along the route to and from the transit stop

2. ACCESS AND CIRCULATION
Key Principles
      The key principles for access and circulation in a transit-oriented development are:



      Connectivity
      Provide multiple entry points into development zones and multiple interconnections with adjoining
      developments.



      Pedestrian-Friendly
      Provide well-designed walkways [and bikeways] for pedestrians both to and from the development
      zones.



      Multimodal Access
      Provide facilities for pedestrians, bicyclists, scooters and motorcycles, cars, vans, trucks, and transit
      vehicles to promote transportation choices.

2.1 Pedestrians
Due to changes in the economy, lifestyle choices, the ever-increasing cost of auto ownership, and congestion, more individuals are seeking alternative
means of transportation. Making an environment that is safe and attractive for pedestrians is the most important element of promoting the use of transit.
          · Maintain ¼ mile walking distances for transit customers
          · Restrict the use of elements that hamper pedestrian movements--meandering sidewalks, fences and walls around properties, berms,
             and expansive parking lots
          · Make all paved pedestrian pathways ADA-accessible
          · Create short cuts through long blocks and across corner parks
          · Enhance crosswalks with striping and pedestrian push-button signals
          · Create linkages between land uses and buildings
          · Minimize pedestrian and vehicle conflict

2.2 Bicycles
Bicyclists are also typical transit customers, especially in warmer weather when bus racks are available on transit vehicles and at their destinations.
           · Provide commuter bicycle / pedestrian paths with drinking fountains, signage and plantings to buffer vehicular traffic and control runoff
           · Provide bicycle racks at transit stops and building entrances which visually complement other streetscape furnishings in those locations
           · Dedicate and mark bike connections between buildings at Dundee Crossings and to / from adjacent neighborhoods and open space

2.3 Transit Vehicles
Transit vehicles are of course the key component of transit service and as such need to be provided for in all aspects of access and circulation. There-
fore, land plans should:
           · Provide passenger drop-off and pickup areas, short term parking, and ADA-accessible parking
           · Employ traffic calming techniques where streets are used by cut-through traffic
           · Mark entrances and exits to and from parking and loading facilities with directional signage where there are multiple access points
           · Coordinate direction of travel and parking bays when parking is shared between properties
           · Provide cross-access to adjacent properties
           · Provide shared driveway access to multiple properties
           · Separate pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular circulation systems
           · Separate access for trucks and other industrial vehicles
           · Share access drives for service vehicles within a large development site to avoid using public streets

2.4 Transit Stops
Well-marked transit stops not only serve existing customers, but also help remind potential customers that transit might be a choice for them.
         · Locate stops at or near intersections with clearly marked crosswalks and sidewalks to building entrances
         · Pave the connection between the street edge, transit stop, and adjacent sidewalks

2.5 Transit Shelters
Shelters at transit stops that provide weather protection make riding the bus a comfortable experience for customers.
          · Provide ADA-accessible boarding and waiting area
          · Provide seating
          · Provide lighting for the shelter and around the exterior
          · Provide route and schedule, transfer, and multimodal information at shelter

2.6 Sidewalks
Sidewalks in the transit-oriented development are an essential component for the convenience of customers.
         · Separate pedestrian sidewalks from vehicular traffic by a landscaped buffer with trees, shrubs, bollards and / or planting beds
         · Provide sidewalk connections from transit stops to building entrances
         · Provide sidewalks in parking areas to building entrances

2.7 Drive Aisles and Bike Lanes
Drive aisles must be of sufficient width to allow ease of movement of the transit vehicles but also provide traffic-calming for other vehicles. Bike
lanes should also be planned on key streets within new developments and incorporated where possible on or along existing roadways.
           · Use the minimum width aisles
           · Indicate bike lanes with striping and surface symbols
           · Use bump-outs at intersections
           · Plan for truck turning radii

2.8 Minor Roads
Minor roads are typically within development zones serving individual parcels and lands uses.
         · Provide narrow landscaped parkway and sidewalks on both sides of the street, two street parking lanes, and two circulation lanes
         · Connect minor roads and streets with other minor public ways
         · Avoid the use of cul-de-sacs and dead-ends

2.9 Minor Intersections
Minor intersections within the development zones should have attractive streetscapes and a pedestrian-orientation.
         · Provide stop and / or yield signs with well-marked cross walks
         · Minimize crossing distances and ensure clear lines of sight for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists
         · Use right angles at all intersecting roadways
         · Use corner buildings to define the intersections

2.10 Major Roads
Major Roads such as Routes 25 and 72 will connect Dundee Crossings with destinations in all directions.
         · Plan major roads and streets to have transit, pedestrian / bicycle and vehicular traffic
         · Provide landscaped parkways and walk/bikeways on both sides of the road with connections to other bike routes
         · Provide a planted median to reduce the amount of pavement and to delineate directions of traffic

2.11 Major Intersections
Major intersections will be utilized by pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles and should accommodate these various travel modes to ensure safety.
          · Place signalized intersections not less than one-quarter mile apart
          · Extend landscaped medians to intersections to serve as a pedestrian crossing refuge
          · Provide well-marked pedestrian crossings across all legs of the intersection, controlled by accessible pedestrian signals with count-
             down and audible features
          · Make crosswalks clearly visible to pedestrians and motorists with materials noticeably different in color and / or texture from asphalt
             or concrete driving surfaces
          · Minimize the number of left and right hand turn lanes for pedestrian safety and to keep the scale of the intersection smaller to en-
             courage walking
          · Define the intersection with corner buildings with distinctive architectural and landscape features

2.12 Midblock Crossings
Midblock crossings are discouraged on major streets and roads, but may be necessary within development zones.
         · Mark midblock crossings with striped crosswalks and pedestrian-activated flashing lights and sound
         · Provide pedestrian crossing signage at all approaches to the midblock

2.13 Driveways and Curb Cuts
Driveways and curb cuts on major roads should be minimized for the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, and should be shared wherever possible off
of minor roads within the developments.

   3. CONCEPT PLAN
   3.0 Development Framework
   Dundee Crossings, centered on the intersection of Routes 25 and 72, provides significant development opportunities for the Village of East Dundee.
   The Development Framework on Page 17 shows how the Village can change the area's land use setting to accommodate new growth and future
   transit service.

   The Framework delineates one of the largest business park settings in the Chicago region, accommodating a wide range of service, sales, technology,
   research, warehousing, and light manufacturing facilities. Internal roads are interconnected throughout the area to facilitate access to/from Route 68,
   Route 72, and Route 25, as well as to set the stage for public or private bus service.

   New commercial development opportunities are shown along each route to serve the business park, area residents and motorists traveling through
   the Village. An enhancement and expansion of the existing Wal-Mart site is defined for the southeast corner of Routes 72 and 25.

   Across from the existing Wal-Mart site to the northwest, the Development Framework accommodates a range of new housing options for the
   community, including rowhomes and senior housing. At the southwest corner, the Framework also provides two redevelopment options for the
   large vacant Santa's Village site. These options include: a small service park for local businesses serving the greater East Dundee area and a mixed-use
   neighborhood with rowhomes, condos, apartments and shops centered on a public space and potential bus stop.

   A large public safety campus is delineated along Route 72 east of the ComEd easement. It can accommodate administrative offices, indoor public
   safety training facilities, outdoor training fields, exercise paths, football/baseball/soccer fields and surface parking. If needed, this location could
   include new Village police and fire stations.

   As noted throughout this report, planning ahead for potential future bus service was a key goal for the Dundee Crossings redevelopment. The
   Development Framework highlights existing and potential bus routes as well as bus stops or nodes that can provide accessible locations for transit
   riders.

   Conceptual building massing within the Development Framework is shown on the Illustrative Plan on Pages 18-19.

4.1 Transit Transfer
Transfer centers are locations where transit customers can switch to other transit routes and services and to private vehicles and bicycles. The po-
tential for a transit `hub' should be incorporated into land plans at the proposed medical center and at the Walmart Supercenter site.
           · Position the hub to be clearly visible and easily accessible by pedestrians and bicyclists
           · Provide short term and ADA-accessible parking close to transfer points
           · Connect sidewalks from the hub to adjacent retail and commercial uses, kiss-n-ride locations, and parking areas
           · Provide signage explaining transit services, hours of operation, and routes
           · Provide a community information kiosk for local and walkable destinations

4.2 Streetscapes
Streetscapes are attractive places where people want to walk or ride their bikes.
         · Provide seating, planting areas, bike racks, trash receptacles, pedestrian and roadway level lighting, and wayfinding signage.
         · Provide a landscaped parkway, planter(s) and / or street trees between the street edge and sidewalks on all streets
         · Provide pedestrian and roadway level lighting
         · Shield light fixtures to avoid glare, spill-over light, and night sky pollution

4.3 Landscape
Landscapes, especially at Dundee Crossings, can carry the visual theme of the development as well as provide a naturalized setting for work, live,
and play.
          · Require landscaping in front of buildings to establish continuity between buildings and to define the sidewalk and street frontage,
             where buildings are absent
          · Place trees and shrubs to not obstruct transit signage
          · Landscape around transit stops and shelters
          · Use landscaping to define use areas and focus on entrances to buildings
          · Divide large surface parking lots into smaller areas with landscaping
          · Landscape medians with salt-, drought- and wind-resistant plant materials
          · Locate trees throughout parking lots
          · Open spaces should be clustered into larger usable and landscaped areas rather than equally distributing them into areas of low im-
             pact, such as site peripheries or the rear of buildings (except when the rear of the building faces an open space)
          · Position landscaping to maintain safe lines of sight
          · Provide appropriate levels of illumination for the security and safety of on-site areas such as building entrances, parking, and service areas
          · Provide screening for loading and equipment areas
          · Select plant materials that are in scale with adjacent buildings and of appropriate size at maturity
          · Separate parking from building perimeters by a landscaped buffer and sidewalk
          · Transition between adjacent properties with landscaping rather than fencing

4.4 Parking
Parking in a transit-oriented development is a necessary component for private and service vehicles, but must not dominate the visual environment.
Parking lots should not be the dominant visual element of each site.
          · Locate parking proximate to the sides and rear of buildings
          · Provide visitor parking, kiss-and-ride pickup and dropoff points, short-term street parking, and ADA-accessible parking nearest to
               transit stops and at transit transfer points
          · Place ADA-accessible parking close to building entrances and vertical transportation
          · Provide sidewalks to and from parking facilities
          · Incorporate pedestrian walkways from parking areas to buildings entrances and from streets to building entrances, especially when
               the areas are served by transit
          · Reduce required parking if parking is shared between uses
          · Avoid expansive paved areas between the street and buildings

Page 24 of 35   Dundee Crossings Corridor Development Guidelines
4.4 Parking, continued
         ·   Favor multiple (and shared) lots separated by landscaping and buildings
         ·   Separate parking from vehicle circulation routes on major roadways but accommodate on-street parking on minor roadways
         ·   Prohibit on-street parking for trucks except delivery vehicles
         ·   Screen truck parking lots with landscaped berms, low screen walls, changes in elevation, or a combination of these

4.5 Service Areas
Service areas such as loading docks and trash handling areas are a necessary component of all building uses.
          · Access by shared driveways and share between properties wherever feasible
          · Locate to the sides or rears of buildings and position to minimize visual impact on adjacent uses
          · Screen roof or ground-mounted equipment with landscaping, walls or fencing
          · Design walls and fencing to complement the site's architecture
          · Locate exterior storage to portions of a site which are least visible to public view
          · Screen storage and trash handling areas with walls, berms, and landscaping
          · Bury overhead utility lines

4.6 Stormwater Management
Stormwater management, that is the detention and retention of rainwater and runoff water, is best handled on a `district-wide' basis rather than on
an individual parcel-by-parcel basis.
          · Use naturalistic landscaped stormwater basins
          · Incorporate the use of vegetated drainage swales, vegetated filter strips and other natural drainage approaches
          · Avoid the use of concrete structures, unless located under paved areas
          · Utilize permeable pavers and under-pavement stormwater detention wherever feasible

4.7 Open Space: Public and Private
Open space for passive and active enjoyment of residents, employees, and visitors should be a primary feature of a transit-oriented development.
        · Define open space by buildings and streets
        · Provide a natural visual experience in the design of open space
        · Provide a public open space within a five-minute walk of each residence and place of employment
        · Create pocket parks for informal activities and visual appeal
        · Keep private or restricted-access open space visually accessible and well maintained
        · Provide extensive pedestrian and bicycle connections to open space from adjacent neighborhoods and development zones

5. BUILDINGS
Key Principles
      Effective transit-oriented developments have buildings which are:


      Well-Positioned
      Create an effective land plan with native features and great blending of architecture and landscape.



      Well-Designed
      Create attractive buildings that fit together as component pieces to create a compelling environment.
      The appearance of buildings, whether modern or more traditional, should fit with the landscape, with
      other buildings nearby, and with activities within buildings.



      Sustainable
      Use sustainable best practices in design and construction, maintenance, and operations.

5.1 Placement
The placement of buildings creates the physical `shape' of a development and is critical to encouraging walking. A lot line establishes the point to
which buildings should be placed in relationship to sidewalks and streets.
         · Establish a consistent lot line to create a consistent block frontage
         · Place buildings as close to the front property lines as possible for the safety and convenience of transit customers
         · Place building entrances so that pedestrians will not need to traverse parking lots or undefined landscaped areas
         · Allow civic buildings to have the most prominent sites and placements
         · Where buildings cannot be located close to the build-to line, use the space with an active use such as outdoor seating, dining, or a
             pocket park, as appropriate

5.2 Entrances
Easy-to-find building entrances are key elements to encouraging a walkable environment.
          · Position main entrances facing the street
          · Make entrances the most important architectural feature of the building
          · Allow civic buildings to have the most prominent entrances

5.3 Facades
The facades or `faces' of buildings help create an attractive walking environment that is also perceived as safe.
         · Incorporate windows at grade level and at all other levels of the building
         · Favor a traditional tri-partite organization of architectural elements: base, middle, and top of building, as well as two sides and middle
         · Place the main building façade parallel to the street right-of-way
         · Position buildings to respect, reinforce, and enhance the entire block-face
         · For corner buildings, develop two facades to act as main building fronts

5.4 Height and Proportion
The height and scale of Dundee Crossings should be compatible with that of surrounding development.
         · Control heights of buildings along streets to be a minimum of two stories and preferably 3-4 so as to create a defining `streetwall'
         · Transition heights of buildings from the lowest adjacent to other properties to tallest at the center of the development zones. The
             height of a building will vary depending on the use of the structure, but should be neither too low or too tall: a two-story minimum
             appearance with three story preferred, and height not exceeding 3-5 stories.
         · All proportions of the building should relate to the human scale
         · Building massing should be coordinated with adjacent properties within the development zones

5.5 Colors and Materials
The colors and materials of buildings will vary depending on the use of the building but should be of the highest quality permitted by project bud-
gets. The objective is to have buildings `work together' visually for a coherent appearance rather than compete for attention.
          · Favor transparent (not reflective) glass for windows, especially at street level
          · Exteriors should favor masonry and non-EIFS masonry-like products and be utilized in an overall building design which is appropriate
              and consistent with the objectives of the Village and reasonable to the market use of the building
          · Favor colors in the neutral ranges of off-whites, soft yellows, golds, tans, reds and browns with compatible accent colors
          · Use primary colors only to accent elements such as door and window frames

Page 30 of 35   Dundee Crossings Corridor Development Guidelines
5.6 Appearance
The appearance and condition of buildings are an important feature of a `walkable' environment.
        · Reflect the intended building use of the design of structures
        · Mix contemporary and traditional architectural styles that relate to each other
        · Light up the exterior of buildings and ground floor interiors
        · Encourage the use of accent lighting to highlight architectural detail or create visual interest

5.7 Building Types:
         Transportation
         Depending on the level of activity, transportation facilities should provide amenities such as ADA-accessible shelters or enclosures, bus bays,
         phones, seating areas, trash receptacles, and bike racks.

         Civic
         Civic buildings, including transit structures and public-use structures, should appear to be the most important buildings at Dundee Crossings
         with the best materials and the most prominent placement and views.

         Retail
         Retail buildings should be as close to the street as possible with `teaser' short term parking in the front and additional parking to the side
         and rear of the buildings. Retail storefronts should be the most interactive and lively of ground floor facades in the development zones.
         Clustered retail, rather than strip retail, is preferred for pedestrian shopper convenience and for better transit service.

         Office
         Office buildings or office floors of a multistory building should be dignified and professional in appearance, with well-articulated elevations.

         Commercial and Light Industry
         Commercial and light industrial businesses should have their main door and front office space along the street with warehouse, production
         and / or distribution facilities at the side and rear.

         Residential
         Residential buildings should offer the most detail in the architecture with balconies, terraces, or patios for residents, and prominent front
         doors. Private areas should be out of view from the street at the sides, rear, or upper stories of a structure.

         Mixed Use
         Mixed-use buildings are typical building prototypes in transit-oriented development. Buildings can include a variation of uses including re-
         tail and commercial uses on the ground floor, office or live / work on the second, and residential above. These buildings play an important
         placemaking role because of their height (typically 3-5 stories) at intermodal transfer points.

         Parking
         Parking garages and structures and their entrances should be at the sides or rear of buildings, not a prominent feature along streets. Win-
         dows or openings in garage doors and walls are highly recommended to avoid `blank' facades.

6. WAYFINDING
Key Principles
      The key principles for wayfinding in a transit-oriented development are:




      Direction
      Provide visual and audible clues for the direction of travel to transit-supportive destinations at distant
      points.



      Reassurance
      Provide visual and audible clues for the direction of travel to transit-supportive destinations at nearby
      points along the way.



      Identification
      Provide visual and audible clues for the direction of travel to transit-supportive destinations at the point
      of arrival.

6.1 Gateways
Gateways made up of signage, graphics, landscape and / or lighting and positioned at key corners or intersections identify a district such as the
Dundee Crossings transit center and reinforce the sense of attractiveness and walkability.
        · Locate gateways to the north, south, east and west of Dundee Crossings and at the intersection of Routes 25 and 72
        · Incorporate kiosks with maps at these gateways to provide direction to area destinations

6.2 Lines of Sight and View Corridors
Clear lines of sight and well-planned / well-preserved view corridors into and out of developments are key components to a transit customer's
sense of safety.
           · Provide unobstructed lines of site for both pedestrians and vehicles at transit stops, at site and building entrances, and between park-
               ing areas and sidewalks
           · Terminate view corridors with distinct architectural or streetscape elements

6.3 Landmarks
Landmarks such as gateways, special-use buildings, and transit shelters are used by customers to recognize their location both day and night.
        · Prominently locate building entrances and special architectural features to act as landmarks
        · Place signage at entrances to key destinations to not compete with the buildings as landmarks

6.4 Transit Vehicles
The transit vehicles themselves are integral to customer wayfinding.
          · Graphically identify transit services on vehicles
          · Provide standing or parking areas in full view of sidewalks and adjacent buildings
          · Provide maps as well as audible messages onboard vehicles

6.5 Transit Stops
Visible transit stops for fixed routes can be an important aspect of transit customer wayfinding.
           · Provide simple signage identifying the transit service and route legible from adjacent sidewalks and driving lanes
           · Also provide information containing schedules and routes, maps, neighborhood / community destinations, and activities
           · Provide well-designed seating, weather protection, and landscaping to help identify the stop
           · Provide `real-time' transit service messaging at transfer hubs

6.6 Signage and Graphics
Signage and graphics are a supporting or reassuring component of a wayfinding system.
         · Provide distinctive and easy-to-remember graphics as a great convenience for customers
         · Mark each bus stop with a pedestrian-scaled sign indicating the transit operator and the routes that serve or connect to the stop
         · Consolidate signage for retail or commercial centers onto one ground-mounted sign, containing the logos or names of businesses, and
             placed for easy viewing by pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists
         · Place billboards and free-standing signs to not obstruct transit stops, buildings, view corridors, or streetscapes
         · Create a common theme for Dundee Crossings with consistent messaging, theme, colors, materials, fonts, and logos
         · Encourage the use of low monument signs
         · Minimize the use of signs in general and relate signage to building architecture, colors, and materials
         · Require property owners to utilize prescribed signage and graphics guidelines on sites and on buildings

Subject:         Task 7 Implementation Strategies Memorandum


Introduction
The purpose of this task is to provide an explicit framework that will assist the Village in
realizing the development goals captured in the Dundee Crossings Preferred Concept Plan and
Design Guidelines. The Dundee Crossings implementation strategy identifies recommended
action steps, including public and private sector responsibilities and potential funding sources.
Some action steps refer to the development of specific sub areas, while others refer to broader
area-wide efforts. These actions are discussed below and summarized in the attached
Implementation Matrix (Appendix A) synthesizing the ideas, opportunities, and priorities that
have been developed during the planning process.

The Dundee Crossings implementation strategy includes the following four components:

      1. Area-Wide Framework: Recommended changes to policies and regulations shaping
         area-wide redevelopment at Dundee Crossings;

      2. Sub Area-Specific Development Facilitation: Key initiatives to guide the
         redevelopment of specific sub areas;

      3. Capital Improvements: A series of public improvements, including both streetscaping,
         basic public infrastructure, and additional private investments triggered by redevelopment
         activity; and

      4. Timing/Priority of Action Steps: A summary of the general time frame, priorities, and
         sequencing of recommended action steps for implementing the Dundee Crossings
         Preferred Concept Plan and Design Guidelines.

Each of these components is discussed in further detail on the following pages.

Area-Wide Framework
This section describes the development regulations, public policies, and transit services that are
integral to Dundee Crossings on an area-wide basis.

ZONING ADJUSTMENTS

Current zoning regulations governing new development in the Study Area are somewhat
mismatched with the development typologies that are shown in the Preferred Concept Plan. The
Village should take steps to review and adjust zoning for the Study Area, either as a sub area-
specific effort or as part of a broader Village-wide initiative, to allow the build-out of the
Preferred Concept Plan.

Some portions of the Study Area are currently zoned for uses that disagree with those shown in
the Preferred Concept Plan. These discrepancies should be reviewed, and the revised zoning
classifications should preclude incompatible uses, while allowing some degree of flexibility for
projects to vary from the specific development program in response to market parameters.

As part of this effort, the Village should consider the pros and cons of employing "form-based
code" techniques. These codes serve the same regulatory function as standard zoning and design
guidelines, but they take a different approach by specifying the desired form of buildings, rather
than solely emphasizing land use and bulk/density regulations such as floor-area ratio (FAR) and
maximum dwelling units per acre. Specific regulatory provisions should reflect the following
key principals:

   ·   Relationship to Preferred Concept Plan and Design Guidelines. The Preferred
       Concept Plan could be considered a preliminary "Illustrative Plan" for the form-based
       regulatory code. As such, it establishes the desired vision for Dundee Crossings and
       reflects a development program and building orientations that would be allowable under
       the Regulating Plan of the form-based code. The Dundee Crossings Design Guidelines
       could provide direction for other code elements, including Public Space Standards,
       Building Form Standards, Landscaping Standards, Signage Standards, and Environmental
       Standards.

   ·   Applicability/Relationship to Existing Zoning. The form-based code should supersede
       the existing zoning classifications that govern the Study Area, but without substantially
       impairing existing development rights allowable under current zoning.

   ·   Shared Parking and Stormwater Management. To facilitate consolidation of curb cuts
       and shared parking facilities, the form-based code should include a provision mandating
       connections between commercial parking lots on adjacent sites. The code should also
       include provisions for consolidated sub area stormwater facilities to relieve the need to
       accommodate all stormwater on-site.

DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES

The Village will need to take an active leadership role in implementing the redevelopment
projects contemplated in the Preferred Concept Plan for key sub-areas. While the Village has no
current plans to acquire properties, active steps undertaken in partnership with a private
developer(s) and others may be required on strategically significant parcels.

As the current economic conditions begin to recover, the Village of East Dundee should maintain
active communication with property owners, target businesses and the development community
to facilitate redevelopment activities in response to market capacity. The Village has identified
several target industries, sponsors, and businesses for the Dundee Crossings area. It is important
for the Village to continue marketing the area and begin facilitating partnerships for land
assembly, site prep, and infrastructure to ready these sub areas for vertical building construction.
The Village should consider facilitating partnerships between current land owners and target
businesses, between the Village and the private sector, and between the Village and other public
units of government such as IDOT and possible institutional users for the Cook County parcel.

Potential sources for implementing the Dundee Crossings Preferred Concept Plan and Design
Guidelines include both public and private sector funding sources. The Village currently has
three Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Districts and one Business Development District (BDD) in
place that encompass the Dundee Crossings area. The Village should determine the financial
capacity of these districts and prioritize the expenditure of these revenues. In addition, other
public sector funding sources and traditional private sector funding sources should be used for
implementation.

The following text summarizes key public sources available for implementation.

Village Funds

Funding for capital improvements and public facilities can be allocated as part of the Village
annual budgeting process and funded out of existing reserves for capital projects.

Tax Increment Financing (TIF)

Under TIF, increases in property taxes from redevelopment and/or natural growth in Equalized
Assessed Valuation within a defined geographic area are allocated to the Village for a period of
no more than 23 years and are used for various eligible public and private redevelopment project
costs. The Dundee Crossings TIF, Christina Drive TIF, and Prairie Lake TIF may provide funds
to support a variety of redevelopment efforts. There are three general categories of eligible
activities that may be supported by tax increment funds under the provisions of the Act:

Public Improvements

       Provision or rehabilitation of public improvements and facilities
       Streets
       Streetscaping

Dundee Crossings Transit Study                                          Implementation Strategies

       Other infrastructure
       Parking

Development/Redevelopment/Rehabilitation Activities

       Assembly and acquisition of sites, demolition, and site preparation including engineered
       barriers addressing ground level (or below) contamination
       Rehabilitation, reconstruction or repair or remodeling of existing public or private
       buildings or fixtures
       Relocation costs to the extent that a municipality determines that relocation costs shall be
       paid or is required to make payment of relocation costs by Federal or State law
       Environmental remediation
       Interest costs incurred related to the construction, renovation or rehabilitation of a
       redevelopment project (generally up to 30 percent of interest, but up to 75 percent of
       interest costs incurred for rehabilitated or new housing units for low- and very low-
       income households)
       Costs of the construction of low income housing (up to 50 percent)

Administrative Support and Financing

       Job training, "Welfare to Work," and related educational programs
       Costs of studies, surveys, development of plans and specifications, implementation and
       administration of the Redevelopment Plan
       Financing costs related to the issuance of obligations
       Payments in lieu of taxes

TIF is one of the few funding mechanisms available to local governments and has proven to be
very effective in spurring redevelopment and public improvements within communities.

TIF is particularly well suited to financing of infrastructure and assisting economically
challenged redevelopment projects with "extraordinary costs" such as land assembly, site
preparation, or environmental cleanup. However, the Village should create a defined application
process for projects requesting TIF assistance to ensure that sufficient data is provided to clearly
justify the need for assistance. The Village should also consider developing and adopting specific
policies regarding the proposed use of TIF funds to assist private development projects, create
consistency and predictability, and limit the potential for land speculation due to the availability
of TIF.

Business Development District (BDD)

Through a BDD, the Village can exercise similar powers to those provided by the TIF Act,
including the ability to solicit and approve proposals for development, use eminent domain,
acquire and dispose of property, and issue bonds or otherwise incur debt to carry out the Plan.
The program also allows a municipality to impose a retail sales tax of up to one percent to pay
for project costs. The Dundee Business Development District primarily encompasses parcels
along the Route 72 and Route 25 corridors in the Dundee Crossings area and carries an

Dundee Crossings Transit Study                                          Implementation Strategies

additional 0.5 percent Business District Tax on the sale of all general merchandise. These
proceeds can be used to leverage other sources including federal funds for roadway
improvements such as the Illinois Transportation Enhancement Program (ITEP) or TIF revenues.
BDD revenues may provide matching dollars for grants or other programs for roadway
improvements, supplement TIF revenues where they are not sufficient to cover the project costs,
or reduce reliance on TIF revenues and thereby shorten the TIF financing period.

Funds from Other Public Entities

Certain improvements directly linked to Route 72 and Route 25 may be eligible for inclusion
within IDOT's overall scope and funding plan. The Village should explore these opportunities as
it approaches IDOT about the planned improvements along these corridors. The Village may also
be able to secure grant funding from other state, federal, and/or regional sources, including any
remaining funds from the TIGER program or other Stimulus funds for roadway improvements.

TRANSIT SERVICES AND AMENITIES

Transit services are a key component of the Dundee Crossings Preferred Concept Plan and will
provide access to the area for employment, retail, and residential uses. As development activities
occur, the Village and Pace will need to monitor demand generated by the increased density and
diversity of these uses. The Village should take an active role in facilitating route and stop
changes to ensure the provision of adequate service levels, and in coordinating the design of
streetscaping, signage, and way-finding that is compatible with Pace operating requirements.


Sub Area-Specific Development Facilitation
The Dundee Crossings Preferred Concept Plan illustrates the recommended development
character, programs, and massing for seven sub areas. These sub areas are delineated in the
attached map (Appendix B) following the Implementation Matrix. This section of this report
highlights each of these sub areas and discusses the key implementation steps and initial leads
for redevelopment activity.

Sub Areas 1 and 3: Business Park Expansion. Since these sub areas are privately held, the
Village's role in fostering redevelopment should be that of a facilitator, rather than an initiator.
The Village should ensure that the zoning and development regulations affecting the site are
adjusted to be consistent with the Preferred Plan. The Village should also maintain active
communication with current property owners as their development plans progress, including
assistance with targeting light industrial, R&D, retail service, and showroom businesses.
Location of commercial activities should take advantage of the frontage along Route 72 and
could support institutional uses occurring at sub area 2.

Sub Area 2: Cook County Parcel. Due to its location on the Cook County side of the Cook
County/ Kane County border, (and the resulting real estate and sales tax disincentives to operate
commercial property on the Cook County side of the border), this site is more likely to be


S. B. Friedman & Company                       5                            Development Advisors
Dundee Crossings Transit Study                                          Implementation Strategies

competitive as an institutional use rather than a commercial use. Since a portion of this site is
also under current mining activity, an institutional use, including open space, is likely to be the
most suitable. Additionally, public infrastructure has not been extended onsite and the
environmental status of the site is currently unknown. The relative complexity of this
redevelopment opportunity suggests that it may be a later-stage project, but the Village should be
responsive to interest from the public or private sectors that is consistent with the economic
development goals of East Dundee. Since this sub area is also privately held, the Village should
focus on facilitating communications and potential partnerships between the current land owner
and interested parties.

Sub Area 4: Parcels South of Route 72. While this sub area is currently outside of the Village
Boundary, these parcels are located along one of the gateway corridors into Dundee Crossings
and are adjacent to other Village planning sub areas. The Village of East Dundee will need to
coordinate planning for this sub area with the Village of Hoffman Estates to ensure that future
development is compatible with the Dundee Crossings Preferred Concept Plan and Design
Guidelines.

Sub Area 5: Wal-Mart Site. This sub area is also privately held and will be influenced by Wal-
Mart's plans to expand at the current location or relocate to another site. The Village should
continue evaluating big-box and mid-box retail formats consistent with the Dundee Crossings
Preferred Concept Plan, while also maintaining active communication with Wal-Mart and the
development community. As more intensive uses result from redevelopment activities, the
Village should also maintain active communication with Pace to ensure that adequate levels of
transit services are provided. The location and proposed redevelopment of this sub area is also
optimal for continued use as a transit destination and the development of a gateway into Dundee
Crossings.

Sub Areas 6 and 7: Santa's Village and River Valley Shopping Center. Both of these sub
areas are privately held by a diverse number of property owners. The Village should closely
monitor market conditions and maintain active communication with land owners, potential
sponsors, and the development community to determine the best time to move forward. The
redevelopment proposed at these sites is also significantly different than existing conditions and
may require the Village to facilitate public-private and private-private partnerships for land
assembly, site-prep and infrastructure improvements. The location and the proposed
redevelopment plan for this sub area are also optimal for continued access via transit and could
serve as a gateway into Dundee Crossings. Currently, both a Tax Increment Financing (TIF)
district and Business Development District (BDD) are in place at this sub area and could
generate significant revenues to off-set some of the extraordinary costs involved with
redeveloping these area and creating a gateway monument. However, the Village should
prioritize expenditures within this sub area and throughout the remaining geographies covered by
the TIF and BDD, as well as communicate clear guidelines for developers approaching the
Village for assistance.

The policy and regulatory actions, and public improvements discussed earlier, are area-wide in
scope and may spur private development efforts on sites other than those specifically discussed
above. It is likely that specific development proposals will differ from the development programs


S. B. Friedman & Company                      6                            Development Advisors
Dundee Crossings Transit Study                                        Implementation Strategies

and site configurations shown in the Preferred Concept Plan. Some proposals may represent
partial or reduced-scale implementation of larger sub area concepts. The Village should remain
open to these proposals, and review them for consistency with the general goals and principles of
the Preferred Concept Plan, as well as their strategic implications on other development
priorities.


Capital Improvements
Strategic public investments in capital improvements are essential to facilitate a high-quality
environment at Dundee Crossings and provide a framework for future private investment and
development. Capital improvements can be costly, and it is important that the Village allocate
its own funds judiciously, and prioritize the use of public funding mechanisms (i.e., TIF and
BDD) throughout the Dundee Crossings area to maximize the impact of its investments. Many
of the sub areas already contain basic water, sewer, and roadway infrastructure supportive of
current development levels. Some opportunities may exist for the Village to share the costs of
additional improvements with the private sector, and with other governmental entities. The
attached Implementation Matrix (Appendix A) notes these opportunities.

The Village's engineering consultant, Gerald L. Heinz & Associates, Inc., has prepared order-of-
magnitude hard cost estimates for certain key public improvements to support the level of
development illustrated in the Dundee Crossings Preferred Concept Plan. These estimates are
provided in Appendix C of this report and include typical development costs such as roadway,
sanitary sewer, water main, storm sewer, stormwater detention, roadway lighting, landscaping,
and engineering reflecting the level of development anticipated by the Preferred Concept Plan. It
should be noted that these estimates do not reflect land acquisition, design, construction
management, and/or contingency costs. They are presented for conceptual planning purposes
only, and do not represent an engineer's opinion of probable cost.

Capital improvements recommended for the Dundee Crossings area that include infrastructure
along existing public right-of-ways should be incorporated into the Village's existing program of
capital improvements and coordinated with IDOT and Pace. These improvements include
streetscape, signage, and way-finding along Route 72 and Route 25. The intersection of Routes
72 and 25 is a key gateway into East Dundee and a priority location for directing available
funding sources to implement these improvements. The Illinois Department of Transportation
(IDOT) controls these two major roads in the study area, and the Village should continue
initiating improvements along these corridors while working with IDOT. The Village should also
coordinate these efforts with Pace to ensure that improvements do not interfere with the
provision of transit services along these corridors. The primary goal of these improvements
should be to increase pedestrian access, support transit services, and develop gateway features
consistent with the Dundee Crossings Preferred Concept Plan and Design Guidelines. Specific
action steps and design considerations are outlined in the attached Implementation Matrix.

Many of the sub areas contain existing onsite water mains, sewer lines, and primary access
roadways. Sub areas 2, 3, and 4 may require connections to adjacent infrastructure that has not
been extended through these sites. The Village should delineate public and private right-of-way

Dundee Crossings Transit Study                                          Implementation Strategies

improvements within sub areas and prioritize the expenditure of available public funding sources
for these improvements.


Timing and Priority of Action Steps

Redevelopment of the study area will occur over a period of several years given the size of the
area, diversity of ownership in several of the sub areas, and current market conditions. The
timing of redevelopment is likely to occur over three general phases, as described below.
Relative timing of specific redevelopment projects within sub areas could change if developer
interest emerges or ownership patterns change.

Immediate/Short-Term projects refer to planning and regulatory actions, as well as projects
that appear to have potential for redevelopment in the near future. Planning and regulatory
actions should occur immediately during the remainder of 2010 and into 2011 to set the
framework for future redevelopment activities. Implementation of short-term projects should be
underway within the next two to three years, although project completion could take longer. In
general, these areas are characterized by vacant land and/or vacant and underutilized buildings,
favorable ownership patterns, and developer interest.

Mid-Term projects include sites that have potential for development in the future, but where site
acquisition and assembly is more difficult due to multiple property owners or lack of immediate
development interest. Implementation of these projects should be underway within the next three
to five years, although project completion could take longer.

Long-Term projects include sites where acquisition and assembly involves multiple ownership,
small lot sizes, and/or other market conditions or characteristics (e.g. limited credit markets and
slow absorption rates) that suggest near-term and mid-term development would be unlikely.
Implementation of these projects could begin with the next five years, with project completion
occurring later.

The attached Implementation Matrix summarizes the key action steps, initial leads, and timing
for redevelopment activities at Dundee Crossings. Further details regarding design and other
considerations are also included in the matrix.

1 Introduction
The  Old  Colony  Planning  Council  (OCPC)  has  conducted  this  study  as  part  of  the  South  Coast  Rail 
Technical  Assistance  Program  to  discern  the  potential  impacts  of  traffic  demand  and  parking  in  and 
around  North  Easton  Village  as  a  result  of  the  development  of  the  North  Easton  Village  commuter  rail 
station.    This  study  includes  the  examination  of  opportunities  to  integrate  and  coordinate  proposed 
plans  to  redevelop  the  Ames  Shovel  Works  residential  development  site,  which  is  located  off  of  North 
Main  Street  and  Oliver  Street,  with  the  South  Coast  Rail  plans.   The  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  develop 
traffic  and  parking  strategies  that  accommodate  Main  Street  businesses  as  well  as  promote  an 
environment  that  encourages mass transit and safe, nonmotorized alternative modes  (including bicycle 
and pedestrian travel).   
 
The goals of the study include: 
 
      Examine  existing  pedestrian  accommodations  and  connections  to  the  North  Easton  Village 
          Station, including bicycle travel  
      Developing  improvements  to  promote  a  walkable  environment  connecting  existing  uses  to  the 
          site 
      Evaluate  traffic  circulation  and  parking  to  improve  traffic  flow  and  safety  and  manage  parking 
          demand for passenger rail as well as other North Easton Village activities 
 
The  North  Easton  Village  Passenger  Rail  station  is  proposed  to  be  located  on  Sullivan  Street  in  North 
Easton adjacent to the existing historic Easton Railroad Depot and the Ames Shovel Works site.  Figure 1 
shows  North  Easton  Village,  the  location  of  the  proposed  passenger  rail  station,  and  the  Ames  Shovel 
Works site. 


2 ExistingConditions
2.1 LandUse
The  land  use  within  the  study  area  consists  of  a  mix  of  uses  and  includes  single  family  residential  and 
apartments, historic estates and historic buildings, the North Easton Village commercial area along Main 
Street  (with  small  shops,  offices,  and  eateries),  the  public  library,  the  Children's  Museum  on  Mechanic 
Street, and an office complex on Oliver and Elm Streets.  Mechanic Street, Oliver Street, and Pond Street 
are  also  bounded  by  conservation  land  and  Shovel  Shop  Pond  to  the  east.   The  abandoned  railroad  line 
dissects  the  village  north  south  along  Sullivan  Street  and  Mechanic  Street,  passing  beneath  Main  Street, 
and  crosses  atgrade  on  Oliver  Street  and  Elm  Street.   A  number  of  single  family  homes  exist  on  Pond 
Street, Andrews Street and Mechanic Street; although much of the single home residential development 
is  located  on  Elm  Street  and  north  of  Elm  Street,  south  of  Main  Street,  and  to  the  west  along  Lincoln 
Street and south of Lincoln Street.

North  Easton  Village  is  within  the  North  Easton  National  Register  Historic  District.      According  to  the 
Town  of  Easton  Historic  Preservation  Plan,  2008,  the  primary  purpose  of  the  National  Register  is  to 
recognize  the  value  of  the  nation's  historic  and  prehistoric  resources  and  to  ensure  that  actions  of  the 
Federal  government  do  not  adversely  affect  those  resources.    The  National  Historic  Preservation  Act 
stipulates  that  federal  and  state  agencies  funding  or  issuing  permits  for  projects  must  consult  with  the 
Massachusetts  Historical  Commission  and  take  potential  adverse  effects  on  historic  properties  into  
consideration  and,  if  they  are  unavoidable,  to  mitigate  them.  In  practice,  the  Massachusetts  Historical 
Commission  should  seek  the  recommendation  of  the  Easton  Historical  Commission  before  making  final 
decisions. 
 
The  proposed  North  Easton  Commuter  Rail  Station  and  the  railroad  rightofway  are  also  adjacent  to 
two  other  important  historical  districts  within  the  North  Easton  National  Register  Historic  District, 
including  the  H.H.  Richardson  National  Register  Historic  Landmark  District  of  North  Easton,  and  the 
proposed  Ames  Historic  District.   According  to  the  Town  of  Easton  Historic  Preservation  Plan,  2008,  the 
H.  H.  Richardson  Historic  District  of  North  Easton  came  about  through  a  coalition  of  local  historians 
working  with  the  National  Park  Service  to  develop  an  appreciation  of  the  connection  of  H.  H. 
Richardson's  architecture  with  the  landscaping  of  F.  L.  Olmsted.    National  historic  landmarks  are 
designated  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior.   In  cases  where  federal  permitting  or  funding  is  involved  or 
when  a  federal  agency's  project  affects  a  National  Historic  Landmark,  the  Advisory  Council  on  Historic 
Preservation  must  have  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  project  and  its  effects  on  the  property.    A 
map of the historic districts in North Easton Village is included in the appendix to this report. 

2.2 PreliminaryCommuterRailStationPlans
The preliminary plan for the Easton Village Passenger Rail alternative calls for the construction of an 800 
foot passenger platform adjacent to the west side of the existing railroad tracks from Oliver Street south 
to  a  point  just  south  of  the  Pond  Street/Mechanic  Street/Sullivan  Street  intersection.   The  platform  will 
be  four  feet  high  and  accessible  via  ramps  to  conform  to  Americans  with  Disability  Act  (ADA)  standards.  
The  platform  will  be  partially  covered  with  a  500  foot  canopy.    A  drop  off  parking  lot  of  ten  parking 
spaces will be built east of the tracks and south of the existing historic Easton Train Depot off of Sullivan 
Street.    This  proposed  lot,  which  is  mostly  located  on  the  Easton  Historical  Society's  property  that 
currently  is  striped  for  35  parking  spaces,  will  be  for  drop  off  use  only  with  all  day  parking  prohibited.  
Bicycle  racks  will  also  be  installed  on  the  west  side  of  Sullivan  Street  at  the  Pond  Street/Mechanic 
Street/Sullivan  Street  intersection.   Access  to  the  platform  (located  on  the  west  side  of  the  tracks)  will 
be  via  Oliver  Street  or  an  existing  pedestrian  underpass  from  Sullivan  Street  located  opposite  the  Pond 
Street/Mechanic  Street/Sullivan  Street  intersection.    This  underpass  will  be  cleaned  of  vegetation  and 
debris for reuse.  Ramps to the proposed four foot high platform will be constructed at the Oliver Street 
and  Sullivan  Street/Underpass  access  points.      The  preliminary  plans  for  the  proposed  North  Easton 
Station are included in the appendix to this report. 
 
The  scheduling  plans  for  the  North  Easton  Station  alternative  include  18  inbound  trains  and  18 
outbound  trains  per  day  with  six  trains  during  the  peak  hours  (three  in  the  morning  and  three  in  the 
afternoon  peak  hours  running  between  20  minute  headways).   The  trains  will  provide  access  between 
Boston and Fall River and New Bedford, as well as communities in between including Stoughton, Easton, 
and Raynham. 
 
According  to  the  Draft  EIS/EIR  for  the  South  Coast  Rail  project,  the  Easton  Station  is  expected  to  attract 
320  riders  per  day  with  the  electric  train  alternative,  or  290  per  day  with  the  diesel  locomotive

2.4 TrafficConditions
The geographic scope of this study includes North Easton Village including Main Street from Pond Street 
west  to  Lincoln  Street  and  Barrows  Street,  including  the  Main  Street/Center  Street  intersection,  as  well 
as  Main  Street  north  from  Center  Street  to  Elm  Street,  Sullivan  Avenue,  Mechanic  Street,  Pond  Street, 
Oliver Street and Elm Street from Main Street to Oliver Street.  All of the study area roads are under the 
jurisdiction  or  the  Town  of  Easton.   Main  Street  is  a  two  lane  minor  urbanized  arterial  that  is  striped  for 
parking  in  the  downtown  between  Mechanic  Street  and  Sullivan  Avenue.   Center  Street  is  classified  as  a 
two  lane  minor  arterial  with  restricted  parking  in  the  vicinity  of  Main  Street.    Lincoln  Street  and  Elm 
Street are two lane collector roads.  The remaining roads that make up the road network are local roads 
under  Town  jurisdiction.   Barrows  Street  is  oneway  northbound  to  Lincoln  Street,  and  Mechanic  Street 
is also one way northbound from Main Street to Andrews Street.   
 
Main Street  provides sidewalks on both sides of the road throughout the downtown, except on the east 
side  north  of  Elm  Street.    Lincoln  Street  provides  sidewalks  on  the  south  side  only.    Sidewalks  are 
provided  for  the  most  part  on  the  road  network  except  on  Mechanic  Street  east  side  north  of  Pond 
Street, the south side of Oliver Street, the north side of Elm Street, and the east side of Pond Street from 
Main Street to the curve in the road. 
 
The  speed  limit  is  posted  at  20  miles  per  hour  on  Main  Street  in  the  village,  and  30  miles  per  hour  on 
Elm  Street.    All  of  the  intersections  are  stop  sign  controlled,  with  traffic  control  missing  at  two 
intersections;  the  Mechanic  Street/Sullivan  Avenue/Pond  Street  intersection  and  the  Mechanic 
Street/Oliver  Street  intersection.    Although  a  stop  line  is  present,  along  with  crosswalks,  at  the  Oliver 
Street  approach  to  the  Oliver  Street/Main  Street  intersection,  the  stop  sign  at  this  intersection  is 
missing.    Main  Street  provides  two  midblock  crosswalks  between  Center  Street  and  Pond  Street  and 
two  midBlock  crosswalks  north  of  Lincoln  Street  and  Center  Street.    Figure  2  shows  the  existing 
conditions in the Easton Village.   
 
As  shown  in  Figure  2,  a  triangular  island  exists  at  the  Lincoln  Street/Main  Street  intersection,  which  is 
referred  to  as  the  "Rockery."    This  median  creates  an  intersection  at  Barrows  Street  and  Main  Street, 
which  currently  lacks  traffic  control.    The  Rockery  is  part  of  the  H.H.  Richardson  National  Register 
Historic  Landmark  District  and  the  proposed  Ames  Historic  District.    The  Center  Street/Main  Street 
intersection  currently  has  a  stop  sign  control  at  three  legs;  Lincoln  Street  eastbound,  Center  Street 
northbound, and Main Street southeast.  The Main Street northwest approach has a free movement.  In 
addition, traffic enters and exits a service station driveway off of Main Street opposite Center Street.  

2.4.1 AverageDailyTraffic,PeakHourFlows,and85thPercentileSpeeds
OCPC  utilized  automatic  traffic  recorders  to  determine  the  average  daily  traffic  (ADT)  at  specific 
locations  on  the  study  area  roadways.   The  automatic  recorders  were  installed  for  a  minimum  48hour 
period  and  recorded  traffic  in  both  directions  in  onehour  intervals.    A  daily  average  (24hour  period) 
was  derived  from  the  48  hour  period.   Figure  3  shows  the  ADT  and  the  peak  hour  traffic  flows  on  the 
study area roads in North Easton Village. 
 
As shown in  Figure 3, traffic  circulation  in and around North  Easton Station is  focused  primarily on  Main 
Street,  Lincoln  Street,  Center  Street,  and  Elm  Street.    Main  Street  carries  the  highest  volumes  with 
12,380  vehicles  per  day  and  1,050  vehicles  during  the  peak  hour  east  of  Lincoln  Street  and  5,270 
vehicles  per  day  and  475  vehicles  during  the  peak  hour  south  of  Oliver  Street.   Lincoln  Street,  west  of 
Barrows  Street  carries  8,280  vehicles  per  day  with  745  vehicles  during  the  peak  hour;  Center  Street

south of Main Street carries 6,470 vehicles per day  and 595 vehicles per hour during  the  peak hour; and 
Elm Street carries 3,400 vehicles per day and 280 vehicles during the peak hour east of Oliver Street.   
 
Figure  3  shows  that  the  minor  streets  within  Easton  Village  carry  approximately  1,000  vehicles  or  less  in 
a  24  hour  period.    Sullivan  Avenue  carries  1,065  vehicles  per  day  with  80  during  the  peak  hour; 
Mechanic  Street  carries  900  vehicles  per  day  and  68  during  the  peak  hour  north  of  Pond  Street  and  185 
vehicles  per  day  and  16  during  the  peak  hour  south  of  Pond  Street;  Pond  Street  carries  225  vehicles  per 
day  and  20  during  the  peak  hour;  and,  Oliver  Street  carries  475  to  645  vehicles  per  day  and  45  to  58 
during the peak hour. 
 
In  addition  to  counting  vehicles,  OCPC's  automatic  traffic  recorders  were  also  utilized  to  determine 
vehicle  speeds  on  the  study  area  roads.    The  85th  percentile  is  the  speed  in  which  85  percent  of  the 
vehicles  were  travelling  on  a  road  within  a  given  study  period.    The  85th  percentile  is  included  by 
MassDOT  in  the  criteria  used  to  determine  the  legal  posted  speed.    It  is  an  indicator  of  the  prevailing 
speed  on  a  road.   Figure  3  includes  the  85th  percentile  for  the  roads  within  the  study  area.   As  shown  in 
Figure  3,  Central  Street  and  Elm  Street  had  the  highest  speeds  with  the  85th  percentile  at  39  miles  per 
hour.    Main  Street  (north  of  Oliver  Street)  and  Lincoln  Street  had  speeds  of  35  miles  per  hour.    The 
prevailing speed on Main Street through the commercial area (east of Central Street) was recorded at 29 
miles  per  hour.   The  speed  on  Sullivan  Street  was  33  miles  per  hour  and  35  miles  per  hour  on  Mechanic 
Street  north  of  Pond  Street  in  the  vicinity  of  the  proposed  rail  station.   The  prevailing  speed  on  Oliver 
Street  was  30  miles  per  hour  in  the  vicinity  of  the  proposed  station,  24  miles  per  hour  on  Mechanic 
Street east of Sullivan Street, and 29 miles per hour on Pond Street.

2.4.2 ExistingTrafficOperations
Manual  turning  movement  counts  were  conducted  at  the  study  area  intersections  within  Easton  Village 
during  the  morning  and  afternoon,  7:00  a.m.  to  9:00  a.m.  and  4:00  p.m.  to  6:00  p.m.  to  determine  the 
morning  and  afternoon  peak  hours  of  operation.    The  turning  movement  counts  include  a  count  of 
pedestrians  and  heavy  vehicles  entering  intersections  as  well  as  passenger  cars.   The  turning  movement 
counts are included in the appendix to this study. 
 
Levelofservice  analyses  (LOS)  were  completed  for  the  study  area  intersections  to  determine  the 
operating  conditions  during  the  morning  and  afternoon  peak  hours.    The  LOS  analysis  was  performed 
utilizing SYNCHRO software.  Levelofservice analysis is a qualitative and quantitative measure based on 
the  analysis  techniques  published  in  the  Highway  Capacity  Manual  by  the  Transportation  Research 
Board.  Levelofservice is a general measure that summarizes the overall operation of an intersection or 
transportation  facility.   It  is  based  upon  the  operational  conditions  of  a  facility  including  lane  use,  traffic 
control,  and  lane  width,  and  takes  into  account  such  factors  as  operating  speeds,  traffic  interruptions, 
and  freedom  to  maneuver.    Levelofservice  represents  a  range  of  operating  conditions  and  is 
summarized  with  letter  grades  from  "A"  to  "F",  with  "A"  being  the  most  desirable.   Levelofservice  "E" 
represents  the  maximum  flow  rate  or  the  capacity  of  a  facility.    The  following  describes  the 
characteristics of each levelofservice: 
 
 LOS  "A"  represents  free  flow.   Individual  users  are  virtually  unaffected  by  the  presence  of  others  in 
     the traffic stream. 
 LOS "B" is in the range of stable flow, but the presence of other users in the traffic stream begins to 
     be noticeable.  Freedom to select desired speeds is still relatively unaffected. 
 LOS  "C"  is  in  the  range  of  stable  flow,  but  marks  the  beginning  of  the  range  of  flow  in  which  the 
     operation  of  individual  users  becomes  significantly  affected  by  interactions  with  others  in  the  traffic 
     stream.  Occasional backups occur behind turning vehicles. 
 LOS  "D"  represents  highdensity,  but  stable,  flow.   Speed  and  freedom  to  maneuver  are  restricted, 
     and  the  driver  experiences  a  below  average  level  of  comfort  and  convenience.    Small  increases  in 
     traffic flow will generally cause operational problems at this level.  
 LOS  "E"  represents  operating  conditions  at  or  near  the  capacity  level.  All  speeds  are  reduced  to  a 
     low,  but  relatively  uniform  level.  Freedom  to  maneuver  within  the  traffic  stream  is  extremely 
     limited,  and  generally  requires  forcing  other  vehicles  to  give  way.   Congestion  levels  and  delay  are 
     very high. 
 LOS  "F"  is  representative  of  forced  or  breakdown  flow.   This  condition  exists  wherever  the  amount 
     of  traffic  approaching  a  point  exceeds  the  amount  that  can  traverse  the  point,  resulting  in  lengthy 
     queues and delay. 
 
The LOS definitions describe conditions based on a number of operational parameters. There are certain 
parameters  utilized  as  measures  of  effectiveness  for  specific  facilities.  In  the  case  of  the  intersections, 
twolane  highways,  and  arterials,  which  represent  the  physical  conditions  that  typify  the  study  area 
corridor,  time  delay,  average  stop  delay,  and  average  travel  speed  are  used  as  measures  of  operational 
effectiveness  to  which  levelsofservice  are  assigned.   Table  1  shows  the  delay  criteria  for  each  levelof
service for both unsignalized and signalized intersections.

North Easton Village Station Area Planning Study                                                                              

Table  2  shows  that  the  study  area  intersections  operate  under  acceptable  levelsofservice  under 
morning  and  afternoon  peak  hour  conditions,  except  for  the  p.m.  peak  at  the  Main  Street  at  Lincoln 
Street and Barrows Street intersection,  and the Main Street at Lincoln Street/Center Street intersection, 
which  experience  LOS  "E"  and  "F"  conditions.    Left  turn  movements  out  of  Barrows  Street  to  Lincoln 
Street  experience  LOS  "E"  conditions  during  the  PM  peak.    At  the  Main  Street/Lincoln  Street/Center 
Street  intersection,  the  three  way  stop  sign  configuration,  a  stop  sign  on  the  southbound,  northbound, 
and  eastbound  approaches,  is  not  allowed  in  Highway  Capacity  Manual  analysis  for  a  fourway 
intersection;  however,  analysis  assuming  that  this  was  a  conventional  stop  signed  intersection  with  a 
stop  sign  on  the  northbound  and  southbound  approaches  shows  that  the  LOS  for  the  southbound 
critical movements would be at LOS "F".   
 
At  the  Main  Street  at  Sullivan  intersection  and  the  Main  Street  at  Pond  Street  intersection,  the  left  turn 
movements  out  of  the  side  street  and  onto  the  major  street  experience  LOS  "D"  conditions,  with 
average delays between 25 and 35 seconds.  This is due mainly to the volume of traffic on Lincoln Street 
and Main Street, which lacks sufficient gaps to allow vehicles in from the side streets without long delay.  
The  Main  Street/Center  Street/Lincoln  Street  intersection  is  a  major  focal  point  of  North  Easton  Village 
traffic.   

2.5 ExistingParkingConditions
Parking  availability  and  restrictions  in  Easton  Village  and  on  the  road  network  were  compiled  based  on 
field visits by staff and information from the Town's parking ordinances obtained from the Easton Police 
Department.   Posted  parking  restrictions  were  observed  by  OCPC  staff  in  the  field.   Parking  is  allowed 
with hourly restrictions on Main Street on the north side between Mechanic Street and Sullivan Avenue, 
and  also  on  the  south  side  of  Main  Street  to  a  point  just  west  of  Sullivan  Avenue.   The  striping  on  Main 
Street  provides  13  parking  spaces  on  the  north  side  and  16  parking  spaces  on  the  south  side,  with 
several  of  these  designated  for  handicapped  parking.     Parking  restrictions  are  posted  on  Main  Street 
that  limit  parking  for  one  hour  between  7  a.m.  and  5  p.m.   Parking  is  also  allowed  on  the  east  side  of 
Sullivan  Avenue,  which  is  restricted  by  Town  ordinance  to  one  hour  parking  between  7  a.m.  and  6  p.m., 
although  these  restrictions  are  not  posted.    There  is  no  striping  on  Sullivan  Avenue  for  designated 
parking,  and  the  east  side  of  the  street  provides  informal  parking  that  can  accommodate  approximately 
15  to  20  vehicles.   In  addition,  the  island  at  Barrows  Street  and  Main  Street  provides  approximately  18 
parking  spaces,  nine  spaces  on  the  Barrows  Street  side  and  nine  spaces  on  the  Main  Street  side.   There 
are  no  parking  restrictions  for  these  18  spaces.   North  Easton  Village  also  has  a  public  parking  lot  off  of 
Mechanic  Street  that  can  accommodate  approximately  35  to  40  vehicles.   Although  the  lot  is  striped  for 
parking,  the  lot  accommodates  additional  informal  parking  on  the  west  side  of  the  lot  behind  the 
Children's  Museum.    The  historic  Easton  Train  Station  contains  a  parking  lot  that  is  striped  to 
accommodate 30 spaces; however, this lot is owned by the Easton Historical Society and is not available 
for public parking.  Figure 4 shows the available parking and restrictions in Easton Village.

Table 3 shows that the parking at the Rockery at Barrows Street and Main Street is heavily utilized in the 
morning  and  at  noon.   Parking  is  at  capacity  in  the  morning  and  near  capacity  at  noon  and  in  the  p.m.  
Although other parking is available in North Easton Village, this area is the closest to capacity.  Parking is 
utilized  along  Main  Street  and  Sullivan  Avenue;  however,  more  than  half  of  the  capacity  is  available 
during  the  day.    Table  3  shows  that  during  the  day  of  the  field  survey,  more  than  half  of  the  parking 
capacity was available at the municipal lot off of Mechanic Street.   
 
Figure  4  shows  parking  availability  in  the  North  Easton  Village.    Figure  4  shows  a  number  of  private 
parking  lots  in  the  Village  that  present  a  potential  for  commuter  rail  utilization  under  an  agreed  upon 
shared  option.    The  most  convenient  to  the  station  is  the  property  owned  by  the  Easton  Historical 
Society,  which  is  located  adjacent  to  the  proposed  commuter  rail  platform  on  Mechanic  Street.   This  lot 
can  accommodate  approximately  30  cars.   This  lot  is  generally  unused  during  the  work  week;  however, 
during  the  week  ends,  this  lot  is  essential  to  Easton  Historical  Society  events.    The  YMCA,  which  is 
located  just  north  of  the  proposed  commuter  rail  platform,  with  access  from  Elm  Street  and  an  exit  on

North Easton Village Station Area Planning Study                                                                          

Oliver Street, has two parking lots.  The YMCA's large lot is adjacent to the YMCA and utilized during the 
day  by  YMCA  members.    The  other  smaller  YMCA  lot  is  located  adjacent  to  Elm  Street.    This  lot  has 
capacity  for  30  vehicles  and  is  usually  empty  during  the  workday.   The  municipal  parking  lot,  located  off 
of Mechanic Street, currently holds approximately 35 to 40 vehicles and is utilized during the day by the 
adjacent Children's Museum and businesses on Main Street.  This lot is also has a pedestrian connection 
directly  to  Main  Street  via  a  back  alley,  which  can  accommodate  wheelchairs,  although  the  ramp  is  in 
need of repair due to corrugations and surface defects.  

Other parking areas in North  Easton include Oakes  Ames  Memorial Hall and the Ames Free Library.  The 
parking  area  behind  Oakes  Ames  Memorial  Hall  has  a  very  limited  amount  of  space  and  access  to  this 
area is poor.  Access to Oakes Ames Memorial Hall parking is on a narrow drive with a steep grade.  This 
access  also  interferes  with  traffic  on  Barrows  Street  adjacent  to  the  Rockery.   Parking  at  the  Ames  Free 
Library is also limited and necessary for library patrons during the day. 

Onstreet  parking  is  limited  in  the  vicinity  of  proposed  train  station.    Nevertheless,  parking  is  not

    2.6 CrashExperience
    Information  on  crashes  at  the  North  Easton  Village  intersections  was  obtained  from  the  Massachusetts 
    Department  of  Transportation  (MassDOT)  for  the  latest  available  threeyear  period  (2006,  2007,  and 
    2008).   This  data,  which  is  made  available  to  MassDOT  by  the  Massachusetts  Registry  of  Motor  Vehicles 
    (RMV),  was  compiled  and  analyzed  in  accordance  with  the  standard  practices  published  by  the  Institute 
    of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in the Manual of Traffic Engineering Studies.  The number and types of 
    crashes  was  compiled  and  intersection  crash  rates  were  calculated  based  on  the  procedures  in  the 
    Manual  of  Traffic  Engineering  Studies  and  compared  with  the  average  crash  rates  for  the  State  and  for 
    MassDOT  District  5.   Table  4  summarizes  the  crashes  at  intersections  in  the  North  Easton  Village.   Table 
    5 summarizes crashes in the North Easton Village along the road not located at a specific intersection. 
     
    The purpose for analyzing crash data includes: 
     
         To define and identify high crash locations; 
         To justify actions for the installation of traffic control devices; 
         To evaluate the geometric design (including lane use) and proposed changes in traffic 
             regulations; 
         To justify expenditures for improvements that offer crash reduction or prevention; 
         To identify a need for traffic enforcement; and, 
         To  identify  needs  in  pedestrian  and  bicycle  safety  and  certain  actions  causing  crashes  that  can 
             be prevented through driver and/or public education.

    of  the  crashes  at  this  intersection  resulted  in  personal  injury.    The  remainder  resulted  in  property 
    damage  only.    This  intersection  experiences  the  heaviest  daily  and  peak  hour  traffic  volumes  and  the 
    alignment  of  the  intersection  is  poor,  with  vehicles  entering  from  the  north  leg  at  skewed  angle  at  the 
    triangular traffic island.  In addition, traffic is entering and exiting a service station from a driveway off of 
    Main Street, directly to and from the intersection opposite Center Street.  The Elm Street at Main Street 
    intersection  had  the  second  most  number  of  crashes  with  five  crashes  in  the  three  year  period.   Two  of 
    these  crashes  were  rearend  crashes  and  three  of  these  crashes  were  lane  departure  crashes  whereby 
    the vehicle ran off the side of the road and hit a fixed object.    
     
    Table  5  shows  crashes  in  the  study  area  that  occurred  along  the  roads  that  were  not  associated  with 
    vehicles  traveling  through  an  intersection.    As  shown  in  Table  5,  the  section  of  Main  Street  east  of 
    Sullivan  and  the  section  of  Main  Street  east  of  Center  Street  experienced  the  most  crashes.    These 
    sections of  Main Street experience the  most activity  with vehicles  entering and  exiting parking spaces in 
    front  of  businesses.    In  addition,  these  sections  of  Main  Street  also  have  a  significant  number  of 
    pedestrians crossing Main Street.  There were two crashes involving pedestrians on Main Street.  One of 
    these  crashes  occurred  on  Main  Street  east  of  Sullivan  Street  and  the  other  occurred  on  Main  Street 
    east  of  Barrows  and  just  west  of  the  Main  Street/Center  Street  intersection  between  the  north  side  of 
    Main Street and the Lincoln Street traffic island.

    Crash  rates  are  used,  according  to  the  Manual  of  Traffic  Engineering  Studies,  to  characterize  the  crash 
    exposure  of  a  facility.    Crash  rates  for  intersections  are  calculated  based  on  the  average  number  of 
    crashes  per  million  entering  vehicles  (MEV).   The  number  of  crashes  often  increases  as  traffic  volumes 
    increase.    Traffic  growth  creates  more  opportunities  for  crashes  and  therefore  increases  vehicle

exposure  to  crashes.    A  particular  condition  that  causes  crashes  at  an  intersection  can  become 
exacerbated  with  increased  traffic,  and  frequency  will  therefore  rise.    The  crash  rate  utilized  for 
intersection  analysis  is  the  crash  rate  per  million  entering  vehicles,  which  is  the  average  number  of 
accidents  per  year  (over  three  years)  times  one  million,  divided  by  the  number  of  vehicles  entering  the 
intersection  in  a  year.    Table  6  shows  the  number  of  crashes  and  crash  rates  for  the  study  area

The  average  statewide  crash  rate  for  Massachusetts  is  0.62  crashes  per  million  entering  vehicles  for  un
signalized  intersections.   The  average  crash  rate  for  MassDOT's  District  5  is  also  0.62  crashes  per  million 
entering  vehicles.   All  of  the  study  area  intersections  are  below  the  average  crash  rates  except  for  the 
Elm  Street  at  Main  Street  intersection  and  the  Mechanic  Street  at  Oliver  Street  intersection.   The  Elm 
Street  at  Main  Street  intersection  experienced  five  crashes  in  the  three  year  study  period;  however,  the 
Mechanic  Street  at  Oliver  Street  intersection  experienced  only  one  crash  in  the  three  year  period.   The 
elevated  crash  rate  is  due  to  the  low  number  of  entering  vehicles  since  the  rate  is  based  on  crashes  per 
million  entering  vehicles.    This  intersection  currently  lacks  traffic  control  (stop  sign).    The  Manual  On 
Engineering  Traffic  Control  Devices  (MUTCD)  recommends  a  stop  sign  to  establish  intersection  control 
and designate rightofway.  The MUTCD recommends that a stop sign be installed based on engineering 
judgment  according  to  factors  such  as  the  number  of  crashes  due  to  lack  of  traffic  control,  lack  of  sight 
distance, and the number of entering vehicles (at least 2,000 vehicles per day entering the intersection).  
Although this intersection does not currently meet these conditions, increases in traffic due to the Ames 
Shovel  Woks  development  and  the  commuter  rail  station  could  possibly  increase  crash  exposure, 
despite  the  low  number  of  crashes  at  this  intersection.   The  Town  should  consider  adding  a  stop  sign  to 
the Mechanic Street northbound approach.

3 FutureImpacts
3.1 PeakHourTripGeneration
In  order  to  discern  the  future  AM  and  PM  peak  hour  and  parking  impacts  of  the  commuter  rail  station 
on  the  North  Easton  Village,  AM  and  PM  peak  hour  trip  generation  for  the  commuter  rail  station  was 
estimated for four future scenarios with various mode shares.  Three of  these  mode share scenarios are 
based on the Draft  EIS/EIR for the South Coast  Rail  project, which  are based on  the traffic  model for  the 
Boston  MPO.    The  remaining  future  scenario  was  developed  by  OCPC  based  on  an  estimate  of  transit 
use and potential bicycle and walking traffic within a 1/2 mile radius to and from the proposed station.   
 
Future peak  hour traffic for this study  was estimated for the  horizon year 2030, which is  consistent with 
the  Draft  EIS/EIR  for  the  South  Coast  Rail.   The  2030  future  traffic  developed  for  this  study  under  the 
four scenarios is based on a background growth of 6.9 percent.  This 6.9 percent background growth was 
used  in  the  Draft  EIS/EIR  for  South  Coast  Rail  to  estimate  2030  peak  hour  volumes  over  2008  volumes.  
The new trips due to the North Easton Commuter Rail Station and the Ames Shovel works were added to 
the 2030 volumes (estimated using the background growth rate) to determine the 2030  "Build" AM and 
PM peak hour volumes. 
 
The  four  future  mode  share  scenarios  for  future  AM  and  PM  peak  hour  traffic  to  and  from  the  station 
due to the North Easton commuter rail station are as follows: 
 
     1. No  park  and  ride  vehicle  trips  (zero  percent),  25  percent  kiss  and  ride  vehicle  trips,  75  percent 
          bicycle and walking trips.  This assumption was used in the DEIS/SEIR for South Coast Rail for the 
          North Easton Station (Appendix 4.1H of the South Coast Rail DEIS/DEIR). 
     2. Thirty  percent  park  and  ride  vehicle  trips,  25  percent  kiss  and  ride  vehicle  trips,  and  45  percent 
          walking  and  bicycle  trips.    This  scenario  has  the  lowest  park  and  ride  share  included  in  other 
          proposed  stations  on  the  proposed  South  Coast  project  (Appendix  4.1H  of  the  South  Coast  Rail 
          DEIS/DEIR) 
     3. Forty  percent  park  and  ride  trips,  25  percent  kiss  and  ride  trips,  and  35  percent  bicycle  and 
          walking trips.  This scenario is based on an estimated increase in transit use that a commuter rail 
          station  generates  in  a  community  where  new  commuter  rail  service  is  introduced  when  a  rail 
          station  is  constructed  in  a  community.    In  1997,  commuter  rail  service  to  Boston  was 
          reintroduced  in  the  OCPC  Region.   Based  on  US  Census  data,  the  increases  in  transit  use  were 
          tracked for seven OCPC communities for the year 2000 over 1990.  A new commuter rail station 
          was located in all of these seven communities in 1997.  An average increase of 3.60 percent was 
          estimated  based  on  the  transit  use  in  2000  over  1990  in  these  communities.   This  increase  was 
          added  to  the  existing  4.7  percent  use  in  Easton  to  estimate  an  8.3  percent  transit  use  within  a 
          halfmile  distance  to  the  proposed  North  Easton  station  to  estimate  the  number  of  walkers  and 
          bicyclists to the station.  The data is included in the appendix to this report.  
     4. Seventy  percent  park  and  ride  vehicle  trips,  25  percent  kiss  and  ride  vehicle  trips,  and  5  percent 
          bicycle  and  walking  trips.    This  scenario  has  the  highest  park  and  ride  share  included  in  other 
          proposed  stations  on  the  proposed  South  Coast  project  (Appendix  4.1H  of  the  South  Coast  Rail 
          DEIS/DEIR)

The  number  of  cars  within  the  morning  peak  hour  that  could  potentially  necessitate  parking  generated 
by the proposed commuter rail station can be derived based upon the park and ride mode split for each 
of  the  future  scenarios.    Table  8  summarizes  this  potential  parking  demand  for  each  of  the  future 
scenarios, based on the number of park and ride commuters expected to use the proposed North Easton 
Station.

Table  8  shows  the  estimated  parking  demand  generated  by  the  proposed  commuter  rail  station  based 
on  the  number  of  park  and  ride  trips  generated  by  the  station  for  the  AM  peak  period.    Scenario  1, 
which  assumes  zero  park  and  ride  vehicles  and  75  percent  walkers  and  bicyclists,  will  likely  generate  no 
parking  demand.   Scenario  2,  which  assumes  a  30  percent  mode  split  for  park  and  ride  vehicles  and  45 
percent  walkers  and  bicyclists,  will  likely  generate  a  need  for  50  parking  spaces,  and  Scenario  2,  which 
assumes a 40 percent park and ride mode split and 35 percent walking and bicyclists, will likely generate

a  demand  for  65  parking  spaces.   Scenario  4,  which  assumes  a  75  percent  mode  split  for  park  and  ride 
and  a  5  percent  mode  split  for  walking  and  bicyclists,  shows  the  most  need  for  parking  with  125  spaces.  
All four scenarios assume a 25 percent mode split for kiss and ride drop off and pickups.  
 
The  number  of  future  trips  expected  due  to  the  Ames  Shovel  Works  development  was  estimated  using 
the  ITE  Trip  Generation  Handbook,  eighth  edition.   The  estimated  number  of  future  trips  was  estimated 
using  the  fitted  curve  equation  for  Land  Use  Code  230  Residential  Condominium/Townhouse.    The 
estimated  daily  trips  and  peak  hour  trips  (peak  hour  of  the  adjacent  street  traffic)  are  shown  in  Table  9.  
The  Ames  Shovel  Works  development  will  provide  onsite  parking  for  residents  and  is  not  expected  to 
impact onstreet or offsite parking in the North Easton Village.

3.2 ModeSplitVerification
In  order  to  verify  the  mode  splits  used  in  the  trip  generation  in  Scenario  1,  Scenario  2,  Scenario  3,  and 
Scenario  4,  OCPC  conducted  counts  of  vehicles,  pedestrians,  and  bicyclists  at  MBTA  commuter  rail 
stations in communities similar to North Easton Village.  These counts were taken for three hour periods 
during  the  morning  and  afternoon  peak  hour  train  arrivals  and  departures.   Counts  were  taken  of  park 
and  ride  vehicles,  kiss  and  ride  vehicles  (dropoff  and  pickup  trips)  pedestrian  trips,  and  bicycle  trips.  
Table 10 summarizes the results of these counts.

was  between  25  percent  and  77  percent  for  park  and  ride,  13  percent  and  27  percent  for  kiss  and  ride, 
and between 10 percent and 48 percent for walk and bicycle.  

3.3 FutureLOSAnalysis
The  future  peak  hour  turning  movements  at  the  study  area  intersections  were  estimated  based  on  the 
number  of  new  vehicle  trips  due  to  the  Ames  Shovel  Works  development  and  the  North  Easton 
Commuter  Rail  Station.   The  AM  and  PM  peak  hour  trips  due  to  the  proposed  Ames  Shovel  Works  and 
the  North  Easton  Commuter  Rail  Station  were  added  to  the  2030  estimated  traffic  to  determine  the 
future  conditions.   Levelofservice  analyses  (LOS)  were  then  completed  for  the  future  AM  and  PM  peak

hours  for  the  study  area  intersections  to  determine  the  future  2030  operating  conditions.    Table  11 
summarizes the LOS for the future 2030 AM and PM peak hour operating conditions. 
 
Table 11 shows that the future traffic operational impacts for the AM and PM peak hours will be focused 
at  the  intersections  where  the  existing  peak  hour  operations  are  problematic.    The  Main  Street  at 
Lincoln  Street  and  Center  Street  intersection  will  experience  LOS  "E"  and  "F"  conditions,  with  very  long 
delays  and  forced  flow  conditions,  under  all  of  the  four  scenarios  (except  for  the  Center  Street 
northbound left, through, and right movements during the AM peak under scenario 1).  This intersection 
currently experiences "E" and "F" conditions during AM and PM operations (except for the Center Street 
northbound  left,  through,  and  right  movements  during  the  AM  peak).    The  Barrows  Street  northbound 
left  turn  movements  at  the  Lincoln  Street/Barrows  Street  intersection  will  continue  to  experience  LOS 
"E"  conditions  (as  it  does  currently)  under  future  operations  and  will  further  drop  to  LOS  "F"  under 
Scenarios  3  and  4.    The  Main  Street  at  Sullivan  intersection  and  the  Main  Street  at  Pond  Street 
intersection will continue to experience delays for southbound vehicles turning left onto Main Street, as 
under  existing  PM  peak  conditions.   The  delays  are  expected  to  be  longer  with  longer  backups  under 
future  PM  peak  conditions  as  the  LOS  will  go  from  LOS  "D"  under  existing  conditions  to  LOS  "E"  under 
future conditions under all future scenarios (except for Scenario 4, which will drop to LOS "F").

3.4 TrafficMitigation
The  Draft  EIS/EIR  for  the  South  Coast  Rail  project  evaluated  future  traffic  at  the  Main  Street/Lincoln 
Street/Center  Street  intersection  to  determine  if  the  volumes  met  the  criteria  for  the  installation  of  a 
traffic  signal  as  published  in  the  Manual  on  Uniform  Traffic  Control  Devices  (MUTCD).   The  Draft  EIS/EIR 
concluded  that  the  intersection  is  projected  to  meet  peak  hour  traffic  signal  warrants  (with  or  without 
the  SCR  Project);  however,  a  traffic  signal  system  with  the  required  lane  configurations  cannot  be 
installed,  due  to  impacts  to  the  adjacent  historic  Rockery,  which  could  not  be  avoided.    Nevertheless, 
LOS  analyses  were  performed  for  the  AM  and  PM  peak  hour  for  the  four  future  scenarios.    Levelof
Service  analyses  were  also  performed  for  the  four  way  stop  control.    The  MUTCD  states  that  the  multi
way  stop  (four  way  stop  sign)  can  be  used  as  an  interim  measure  to  control  traffic  where  traffic  control 
signals  are  justified.    Table  12  summarizes  the  AM  and  PM  Peak  hours  for  the  Main  Street/Lincoln 
Street/Center Street intersection under 2030 signalized conditions, and Table 13 summarize the AM and 
PM  peak  hour  LOS  for  the  Main  Street/Lincoln  Street/Center  Street  intersection  under  2030  four  way 
stop control conditions.

Table  12  shows  that  a  signal  at  the  Main  Street/Lincoln  Street  and  Center  Street  intersection  would 
result  in  acceptable  AM  and  PM  peak  hour  levelsofservice  under  2030  conditions  with  the  commuter 
rail  station  in  place.   Table  13  shows  that  a  fourway  stop  sign  at  this  intersection  would  result  in  level
ofservice  of  "D"  or  better  for  all  movements  under  2030  AM  and  PM  peak  hour  conditions,  except  for 
the Main Street westbound movements, which would result in LOS "F" conditions.

North Easton Village Station Area Planning Study                                                                           

4 ConclusionsandRecommendations
In  addition  to  its  typical  New  England  small  town  environment,  North  Easton  Village  has  its  own  unique 
character  due  to  several  buildings  designed  by  the  renowned  architect  H.H.  Richardson.    In  addition, 
estates  built  by  members  of  the  Ames  family  have  added  to  this  character  with  a  legacy  of  picturesque 
landscapes.    These  assets  have  led  the  Town  to  establish  the  North  Easton  National  Register  Historic 
District,  the  H.H.  Richardson  National  Register  Historic  Landmark  District,  and  the  proposed  Ames 
Historic  District.    It  is  important  that  future  development  in  the  village,  such  as  the  addition  of  the 
commuter rail station, contribute to preserving and enhancing this unique town character. 
 
Estimates  in  trip  generation  for  park  and  ride  vehicles,  which  are  based  upon  the  daily  and  peak  hour 
ridership of the proposed  North Easton Village station in the Draft EIS/EIR for the project, show that  the 
proposed  commuter  rail  station  could  likely  produce  a  parking  demand  in  the  morning  between  50  and 
125  vehicles.    The  Draft  EIS/EIR  assumed  that  75  percent  of  the  riders  would  reach  the  station  by 
walking  or  bicycle,  and  that  there  would  be  zero  park  and  riders  since  no  parking  would  be  provided  at 
the  station.   This  assumes  that  106  people  would  bicycle  or  walk  to  the  station  in  the  morning  and  240 
people  would  bicycle  or  walk  to  the  station  daily;  therefore  requiring  no  parking  associated  with  the 
commuter  rail  station.   This  represents  a  "least  case"  scenario  for  traffic  and  parking  impacts,  with  the 
only  traffic  being  generated  by  the  station  coming  from  the  "kiss  and  ride"  drop  off  and  pickups,  which 
would  represent  25  percent  of  the  mode  split  (approximately  160  trips  per  day,  80  in  and  80  out).   The 
"worst  case"  scenario,  scenario  4,  assumes  that  70  percent  of  the  commuters  arrive  at  the  station  via 
single occupancy vehicle, 25 percent arrive via kiss and ride, and 5 percent arrive by foot or bicycle.  This 
scenario  results  in  the  highest  vehicle  trip  generation  and  the  highest  parking  demand  with  a  need  for 
125 parking spaces.   
 
Counts  of  vehicles,  pedestrians,  and  bicyclists  were  taken  by  OCPC  of  existing  MBTA  rail  stations  similar 
to the proposed North Easton station.  These stations include Beverly Farms in Beverly, Dedham Station, 
Abington  Station,  and  the  Whitman  Station.   These  counts  showed  that  the  mode  split  for  walkers  and 
bicyclists  was  generally  in  the  vicinity  of  30  percent.   These  counts  also  showed  that  riders  parked  on 
street  despite  posted  hourly  parking  limitations  and  available  parking  adjacent  to  the  station.    These 
counts taken by OCPC of trip generation and modes split are included in the appendix to this report. 
 
If  the  mode  split  for  the  proposed  North  Easton  Commuter  Rail  Station  is  similar  to  Scenario  2  and 
Scenario  3,  the  resultant  demand  will  be  between  50  and  65  parking  spaces.   These  50  to  65  potential 
park and ride commuter rail riders are likely to park in North Easton Village close to the proposed station 
(either  onstreet  or  at  the  existing  municipal  lot  behind  Main  Street)  since  no  offstreet  parking  is 
planned in conjunction with the proposed station.      
 
In addition to the potential impact to onstreet parking in the North Easton Village, traffic generated due 
to  the  proposed  commuter  rail  station  will  add  to  the  increasingly  poor  levelsofservice  at  several 
intersections  along  Main  Street  including  Lincoln  Street  at  Barrows  Street  intersection,  Main  Street  at 
Lincoln  Street  and  Center  Street,  Main  Street  at  Sullivan  Street,  and  Main  Street  at  Pond  Street.    The 
Main  Street  at  Lincoln  Street  and  Center  Street  intersection  is  a  key  intersection  in  the  village  that  is 
already  experiencing  poor  LOS  under  existing  AM  and  PM  Peak  conditions  (LOS  "F").   At  the  other  Main 
Street  intersections,  the  poor  peak  hour  LevelsofService  are  experienced  on  the  minor  street 
movements out of the side streets entering Main Streets due to the lack of sufficient gaps in Main Street 
traffic.

North Easton Village Station Area Planning Study                                                                         

Safety at the study area intersections and the Main Street corridor are also a concern, since more traffic 
in  the  area  will  increase  pedestrian  exposure  as  well  as  vehicular  exposure  along  Main  Street  and  at 
study area intersections.  Although the area has extensive sidewalks on at least one side, there are some 
gaps  in  the  sidewalks,  especially  on  Canton  Road.   These  gaps  impact  the  potential  for  walkers  to  the 
proposed station and expose pedestrians to vehicular traffic as they transition from one side of the road 
to  the  other.   Other  serious  threats  to  pedestrians  include  exposure  to  train  tracks.   The  MBTA  should 
maintain  fencing  along  the  tracks  to  keep  pedestrians  away  from  the  train  rightofway.    The  existing 
fencing along the rightofway is currently in a state of disrepair.   
 
The  recommendations  in  this  report  were  developed  in  keeping  with  the  Town's  needs  to  preserve  and 
enhance  the  character  of  North  Easton  Village,  and  to  ensure  safety  for  vehicles,  bicyclists,  and 
pedestrians.   Based  on  the  levelof  service  analyses,  the  parking  inventory  and  survey,  and  the  analysis 
of  the  potential  for  parking  impacts  from  the  proposed  commuter  rail  station,  the  following 
recommendations were developed: 
 
      The  Town  should  review,  revise,  and  update  its  ordinances  on  parking  restrictions  in  the  North 
          Easton  Village  to  prevent  commuter  rail  riders  from  parking  on  Elm  Street,  Oliver  Street,  Pond 
          Street,  Andrews  Street,  and  in  the  municipal  parking  lot.   Parking  restrictions  and  limitations  on 
          these  streets  should  be  posted.    These  areas  should  be  for  noncommuter  rail  station  use.  
          Posting  for  parking  in  the  municipal  lot  should  be  restricted  for  use  for  patrons  to  downtown 
          businesses and destinations, and all day parking should be prohibited in this lot. 
      Additional  enforcement  will  likely  be  required  on  Main  Street,  Oliver  Street,  at  the  commuter 
          rail  platform  entrance,  and  on  Mechanic  Street,  at  the  proposed  tunnel  beneath  the  tracks,  in 
          order  to  ensure  that  motorists  do  not  stop  in  traffic  to  drop  off  and  pick  up  passengers.  
          Enforcement  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  all  dropoffs  and  pickups  associated  with  the  MBTA 
          should be done in the designated area.  
      Stop  signs,  with  stop  lines,  should  be  posted  on  the  Oliver  Street  approach  to  the  Oliver 
          Street/Main  Street  intersection,  on  the  Pond  Street  approach  and  Mechanic  Street  (northwest) 
          approach  to  the  Sullivan  Street/Mechanic  Street/Pond  Street  intersection,  and  on  the  Mechanic 
          Street  northbound  approach  to  the  Oliver  Street/Mechanic  Street  intersection.    A  stop  sign 
          should  also  be  posted  on  the  Barrows  Street  northbound  approach  to  the  Barrows  Street/Main 
          Street intersection (just north of the Rockery). 
      The  Town  should  consider  making  the  Main  Street/Lincoln  Street/Center  Street  intersection  a 
          fourway  stop  controlled  intersection  or  adding  traffic  signals  to  this  intersection.   Although  the 
          Draft EIS/EIR for the South Coast Rail stated that lane reconfiguration would impact the rockery, 
          the 2030 LOS analysis for this study assumed no changes in lane use under signal operation.    
      The  Easton  Historical  Society  parking  lot  on  Sullivan  Avenue  (next  to  the  proposed  MBTA 
          platform  site)  and  the  YMCA  lot  (small  northern  lot  off  of  Elm  Street)  represent  two 
          opportunities to provide parking areas for MBTA commuters that are easily accessible by foot to 
          the platform.  Both of these lots are unused during the week day and can provide the lot owners 
          with  added  income  from  parking  fees.   The  MBTA  and  the  Town  of  Easton  should  approach  the 
          Easton  Historical  Society  to  share  parking  (30  spaces)  at  its  Sullivan  Street  lot  for  MBTA 
          commuters  during  the  work  week.   The  Town  and  MBTA  should  also  ensure  that  the  Historical 
          Society  agrees  to  allow  the  MBTA  to  use  this  parking  area  as  a  designated  dropoff  and  pickup 
          area  for  passengers.    The  MBTA  and  the  Town  of  Easton  also  should  approach  the  YMCA  to 
          share  its  upper  lot  (approximately  30  parking  spaces)  off  of  Elm  Street  for  MBTA  commuters 
          during  the  work week.   This lot is accessible via Elm  Street.  Signs  on Elm  Street and Main Street 
          should  be  posted  to  direct  commuters  to  this  lot  for  MBTA  parking.   The  access  on  Elm  Street

Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed Marketplace at
Cochrane Village project in Morgan Hill, California. The vacant 20.25-acre project site is located along the
south side of Cochrane Road between Butterfield Boulevard and Sutter Boulevard.
The project as proposed includes two project alternatives consisting of retail and residential land use
components. The two project alternatives analyzed within this study are the following:
Commercial Development Alternative: 160,200 square feet (s.f.) of retail/commercial space (big box),
10,000 s.f. of ancillary retail space, 10,000 s.f. tire store, 6,400 s.f. of quality restaurant space, and 6,100
s.f. of fast food restaurant space.
Mixed-Use Development Alternative: Up to 260 residential units,18,500 s.f. of retail space, and 10,000
s.f. day care center that can serve up to 120 students. The mixed-use development alternative may
include an additional 10,000 s.f. of retail space in lieu if the day care center. A comparison of trip
generation estimates for day care centers and retail space indicates that the proposed day care center
would generate a greater amount of trips than the potential 10,000 s.f. of retail space. Therefore, this
analysis includes the evaluation of the proposed day care center since it will result in the greatest amount
of additional traffic.
Under the commercial development scenario, Cochrane Road, Butterfield Boulevard, and Jarvis Drive will
provide direct vehicle access to the project site. One driveway along Cochrane Road would serve as the
main entrance to the project site. Two secondary driveways onto Cochrane Road also would serve the
project site. One driveway onto Butterfield Boulevard and three driveways onto Jarvis Drive also would
provide access to the project site. Additionally, the parking lot of the proposed project would connect to
the parking lot of the existing commercial development located just east of the project
site. Therefore, vehicles could also indirectly access the project site using the driveways serving the
adjacent existing commercial development, which is accessed by one driveway along Sutter Boulevard
and one driveway along Jarvis Drive.

Under the mixed-use development scenario, Cochrane Road and Jarvis Drive will provide direct vehicle
access to the project site. The main driveway along Cochrane Road would provide access to both the
residential and commercial uses. Two secondary driveways (right-in and out access only) along Cochrane
Road also would serve the commercial uses on site. A driveway onto Jarvis Drive would provide access
to the proposed residences. Additionally, the parking lot serving the proposed building located at the
northeast corner of the project site would connect to the parking lot of the existing commercial
development located just east of the project site. Therefore, vehicles could also indirectly access this
portion of the project site using the driveways serving the adjacent existing commercial development,
which consist of one driveway along Sutter Boulevard and one driveway along Jarvis Drive.

Marketplace at Cochrane Village                                                              June 7, 2013 


Scope of Study
The purpose of the study is to identify the potential traffic impacts related to the proposed project. The
potential impacts related to the proposed development were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the City of Morgan Hill and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA). The VTA administers the County Congestion Management Program (CMP).
The study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak-hour traffic conditions for 19 signalized intersections,
six unsignalized intersections, and seven freeway segments for each of the project alternatives analyzed.
The study intersections were selected based upon the estimated number of project trips through the
intersection (10 or more trips per lane per hour). The study also includes a site access analysis, which
includes levels of service analysis, signal warrant analysis, site distance analysis, and vehicle-storage
requirements at the proposed project access points. In addition, a General Plan Amendment analysis also
was completed for the land use change proposed by the Mixed-Use Development Alternative.
Traffic conditions at all of the study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours.
The weekday AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM and the weekday PM peak
hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the most congested traffic
conditions occur on a typical weekday.


Project Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate to common land uses their
propensity for producing traffic. Thus, for the most common land uses there are standard trip generation
rates that can be applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new
development. Trip estimates for each of the proposed project alternatives were developed based on trip
generation rates obtained from ITE's Trip Generation, Ninth Edition, 2012, and reductions for mixed-use
development and pass-by-trips for retail land uses.

Commercial Development Alternative
Based on the ITE trip generation rates and reductions for pass-by-trips, it is estimated that the
Commercial Development Alternative would generate 7,895 daily trips, with 413 trips (227 inbound and
186 outbound) occurring during the AM peak hour and 514 trips (266 inbound and 248 outbound)
occurring during the PM peak hour.

Mixed-Use Development Alternative
Based on the ITE trip generation rates and reductions for mixed-use development and pass-by-trips, it is
estimated that the Mixed-Use Development Alternative would generate 3,917 daily trips, with 352 trips
(146 inbound and 206 outbound) occurring during the AM peak hour and 321 trips (184 inbound and 137
outbound) occurring during the PM peak hour.

Existing Plus Project Impacts On Intersection Levels of Service

Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The intersection level of service is summarized in Table ES1. Based on the intersection level of service
analysis, the Mixed-Use Development Alternative would not significantly impact any of the study
intersections under existing plus project conditions. One of the 25 study intersections (Woodview Avenue
and Cochrane Road) would be impacted by the project under existing plus Commercial Development
Alternative conditions, according to City of Morgan Hill level of service standards. The proposed
mitigation measure for the Commercial Development Alternative is presented below:



                                                                                   Page|vi     
Marketplace at Cochrane Village                                                                                 June 7, 2013 


Woodview Avenue and Cochrane Road (Unsignalized)
Mitigation:      The necessary improvements to mitigate project impacts at this intersection consist of the
                 construction of a raised median along Cochrane Road at Woodview Avenue to restrict
                 left-turns into and out of Woodview Avenue and out of the project site. With the left-turn
                 restrictions, only right-turns in and out of both Woodview Avenue and the project site and
                 left-turns in from Cochrane Road into the project site would be allowed at this location,
                 reducing the amount of conflicting traffic at the intersection. With the restriction of the left-
                 turn movements, as described above, the intersection of Woodview Avenue and
                 Cochrane Road would operate at an acceptable LOS B during both peak hours under
                 both project alternatives analyzed. The turn-restrictions at Woodview Avenue would
                 result in the redistribution of traffic originating from and bound for Woodview Avenue to
                 utilize Sutter Boulevard and Madrone Parkway. However, the redistribution of traffic
                 would not result in a degradation of levels of service at the Sutter Boulevard and
                 Madrone Parkway intersections with Cochrane Road. It should also be noted that the left-
                 turn movement into Woodview Avenue from Cochrane Road could be maintained without
                 having an adverse effect on operations at the intersection.

Freeway Segment Analysis
The results of the freeway level of service analysis are summarized in Tables ES 2 and ES3. The freeway
level of service analysis shows that neither of the project alternatives would result in a significant impact
under project conditions on any of the study freeway segments.


Other Transportation Issues

Site Access Analysis
An evaluation of site access at each of the primary site access points was completed and identified
several recommended roadway improvements. Table ES 4 provides a summary of the site access
analysis.

Woodview Avenue and Cochrane Road Intersection
A fourth leg will be added to the Woodview Avenue and Cochrane Road intersection with the
development of the proposed project. The turn movements in and out of the project site will result in the
addition of conflicting turn-movements at the Woodview Avenue and Cochrane Road intersection. Due to
the relatively high traffic volumes and limited gaps in traffic flow along Cochrane Road and the planned
widening of Cochrane Road to six-lanes, left-turn movements at Woodview Avenue will experience
lengthy delays and potential safety issues.
Restricting turn movements at the intersection to right-turns only in and out of both Woodview Avenue
and the project site and left-turns from Cochrane Road into the project site will reduce the amount of
conflicting traffic at the intersection. Therefore, it is recommended that left-turns into and out of Woodview
Avenue and out of the project site be restricted with the installation of a raised median along Cochrane
Road at Woodview Avenue, as described under the project impacts section. The turn-restrictions at
Woodview Avenue would result in the redistribution of traffic originating from and bound for Woodview
Avenue to Sutter Boulevard and Madrone Parkway. However, the redistribution of traffic would not result
in a degradation of levels of service at the Sutter Boulevard and Madrone Parkway intersections with
Cochrane Road. It should also be noted that the left-turn movement into Woodview Avenue from
Cochrane Road could be maintained without having an adverse effect on operations at the intersection.

Marketplace at Cochrane Village                                                                June 7, 2013 


On-Site Circulation

Commercial Development Alternative
Under the Commercial Development Alternative (see Figure 2), all surface parking would have drive
aisles of 25 feet in width, which would allow for adequate two-way circulation and maneuvering for 90-
degree parking stalls. All proposed parking spaces are shown to be 90-degree parking stalls. Additionally,
the planned internal roadway network contains no dead-end drive aisles on site, with the exception of two
small parking areas adjacent to two proposed buildings located along each side of the main entrance.
Depending on the type of use they are serving (whether they have a low or high parking turn-over), dead-
end parking lots could be problematic since drivers would have to complete a three-point turn upon
entering the parking area and realizing that no parking is available. With the exception of these two small
parking areas, the design and layout of the surface parking areas is adequate to accommodate circulation
of both passenger and emergency vehicles.
Although the site plan does not contain this level of detail, clear pedestrian connections between the
parking areas and the proposed buildings should be provided. As recommended by the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), the site plan shows all accessible parking spaces to be located on the shortest
route of travel from adjacent parking to the proposed buildings.

Mixed-Use Development Alternative
Under the Mixed-Use Development Alternative (see Figure 3), there is three general parking areas
serving the commercial portion of the project, located along the north side of the project site. The first
parking area, located west of the main entrance driveway on Cochrane Road, would provide continuous
circulation with no dead-end aisles. This parking area is accessible via the main access driveway and via
a right-in and out driveway along Cochrane Drive.
The second parking area serving the commercial uses would be located on the east side of the main
entrance driveway on Cochrane Road, at what seems to be a distance of less than 100 feet south of the
main driveway. The location of the second parking area (in close proximity to the main entrance)
potentially could be problematic. Vehicles turning into the second parking lot from the main driveway
would have to yield to vehicles leaving the site, potentially having to stop at the site's main entrance and
blocking access to other vehicles driving into the site. Additionally, if the inbound access lane at the main
driveway is blocked by vehicles turning left into the second parking area, limited queue storage would be
provided for other inbound traffic within the main driveway, potentially spilling onto Cochrane Drive. The
type of commercial use the second parking area would serve (whether it has a low or high parking turn-
over) would dictate the magnitude of the disruption to other inbound traffic. It is recommended that the
second parking area be relocated further south, away from the main entrance driveway, and/or that a
turn-pocket be provided to serve traffic coming into the site and access this parking area without blocking
access to other inbound traffic. Alternatively, stop signs could be placed at the second parking area
controlling outbound traffic both from the second parking area and the rest of the project site and allowing
free flow of inbound traffic, including left-turning traffic into the second parking area. Since the second
parking area also provides a dead-end aisle, a turn-out at the end of the aisle also might be desirable in
order to facilitate circulation within the second parking area when all parking stalls are occupied.
The third parking area serving the commercial uses would be located at the northeast corner of the
project site, and would consist of two rows of 90-degree parking spaces (with a single middle drive aisle)
served by a right-in and out only driveway along Cochrane Road and a secondary driveway connecting
this parking area to the existing commercial uses east of the project site. Access and circulation within the
third parking area would be adequate provided it would be served by at least two driveways.
Main access to the residential units would be provided by a full-access driveway along Jarvis Drive, in
addition to the main access driveway along Cochrane Road. Both driveways would provide access to
every residential unit within the site. All access roads and drive aisles within the residential portion of the
project site are shown to be a minimum of 25 feet wide, which is adequate for two-way travel and
                                                                                     Page|viii 
                                                     
Marketplace at Cochrane Village                                                              June 7, 2013 


emergency vehicle access and circulation. Additionally, both parallel and 90-degree on-street parking
spaces would be provided throughout the residential area, and a small parking area (consisting of a set of
back-to-back 90-degree parking spaces) is provided at the southwest corner of the project site. The site
plan also shows what seems to be a restricted access from a second driveway along Jarvis Drive (east of
Butterfield Boulevard) connecting to the parking area. This third access point most likely would be
designated as an emergency access and would be restricted to be used by emergency vehicles only
and/or as an emergency route.
Although the site plan does not contain this level of detail, clear pedestrian connections between the
residences and existing/proposed pedestrian facilities should be provided, in particular between the
residences and the proposed commercial uses, as well as to existing sidewalks along the adjacent
streets. Overall, circulation within the residential portion of the proposed project would be adequate.

Transit, Pedestrian, and Bicycle Analysis
The project site is served by three of the four bus lines that serve the City of Morgan Hill. In addition, two
express lines provide service from the project area to the Morgan Hill Caltrain Station during PM commute
periods. A typical mode split in Morgan Hill would be a three percent transit share. Assuming up to three
percent transit mode share for the project equates to no more than 15 transit riders during the AM and
PM peak hours. The transit ridership demands of the proposed project will not justify the enhancement of
the existing transit facilities.
Sidewalks are provided along the north side of Jarvis Drive from the project's eastern boundary to Sutter
Boulevard, however the sidewalk is intermittent along the project frontage. The project will provide a
sidewalk along its entire frontage and result in a continuous connection to the existing sidewalk along
Jarvis Drive to provide residents and visitors with a safe connection between the project site and other
surrounding land uses in the area.
There are several bike lanes and bike paths in the vicinity of the project site. Monterey Road has bike
lanes along nearly its entire length within City of Morgan Hill limits, with the exception of the segment that
runs through downtown between Dunne Avenue and Main Avenue. Bike lanes also are provided along
the entire lengths of Cochrane Road, Butterfield Boulevard, and Sutter Boulevard. It is expected that
bicycle trips would comprise no more than one percent of the total project-generated trips. Thus, the
project could potentially generate no more than five new bicycle trips during each of the peak hours. The
demand generated by the proposed project could be accommodated by the existing bicycle facilities in
the vicinity of the project site.


Year 2015 Cumulative Impacts on Intersection Levels of Service
The results of intersection level of service analysis under Year 2015 cumulative show that two
unsignalized intersections would operate at unacceptable levels under Year 2015 Cumulative without and
with project conditions for both project alternatives analyzed during at least one peak hour when
measured against the City of Morgan Hill level of service standards.
                         10       Mission View Drive and Cochrane Road
                         11       Sutter Boulevard and Cochrane Plaza
However, peak-hour traffic signal warrant checks indicate that the Sutter Boulevard and Cochrane Plaza
intersection would not have traffic volumes under Year 2015 Cumulative without and with project
conditions for both project alternatives that meet thresholds that warrant signalization. Therefore, based
on the City's impact criteria and signal warrant analysis, the proposed project alternatives would not result
in a cumulatively significant impact at the Sutter Boulevard and Cochrane Plaza intersection.
Peak-hour traffic signal warrant checks indicate that the traffic volumes at the Mission View and Cochrane
Road intersection currently meet and are projected to continue to meet thresholds that warrant
signalization under Year 2015 Cumulative without and with project conditions for both project alternatives

analyzed. However, each approach leg at the intersection is currently stop-controlled, therefore there is
no safety issue that requires the installation of a signal. In addition, the addition of proposed project will
result in an increase in delay at the intersection of less than three seconds under both project
alternatives. Therefore, the proposed project alternatives would not result in a significant impact at the
Mission View Drive and Cochrane Road intersection. The signalization of the Mission View and Cochrane
Road intersection is included within the Year 2030 General Plan roadway network and will be completed
concurrently with the planned extension of Mission View Drive from Cochrane Road to Vista del Lomas
Avenue.


Year 2030 General Plan Amendment Impacts on Intersection Levels of
Service
An analysis of long-term Year 2030 General Plan traffic impacts on the citywide transportation system
associated with the proposed land use change of the Mixed-Use Development Alternative was also
completed. The Mixed-Use Development Alternative will require a land use amendment to allow for the
proposed residential units. The proposed Mixed-Use Development Alternative involves changing the
City's General Plan land use designation for the project site from Industrial to Mixed-Use. Though the
land uses proposed for the project site as part of the Commercial Development Alternative are consistent
with the City's current General Plan, Year 2030 conditions analysis was completed for the Commercial
Development Alternative for informational and project alternative comparative purposes
The Year 2030 General Plan conditions analysis indicates that the proposed land use change of the
mixed-use alternative would result in an increase in AM peak hour trips and decrease in PM peak hour
trips. The level of service results under Year 2030 General Plan without and with project conditions show
that, one unsignalized intersection, Sutter Boulevard and Cochrane Plaza, would operate at unacceptable
levels during Year 2030 General Plan without and with project conditions for both project alternatives
during the PM peak hour when measured against the City of Morgan Hill level of service standards.
However, peak-hour traffic signal warrant checks indicate that the Sutter Boulevard and Cochrane Plaza
intersection would not have traffic volumes under Year 2030 General Plan without and with project
conditions, for both project alternatives, that meet thresholds that warrant signalization. Therefore, based
on the City's impact criteria and signal warrant analysis, the proposed project alternatives would not result
in a significant impact at the Sutter Boulevard and Cochrane Plaza intersection.
The comparison of Year 2030 General Plan with project conditions against existing conditions indicates
that the proposed land use amendments would not result in a significant impact to any of the study
intersections since all signalized study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of
service under Year 2030 General Plan with project conditions for both project alternatives. Similarly,
though the unsignalized Sutter Boulevard and Cochrane Plaza intersection is projected to operate at
unacceptable levels during Year 2030 General Plan with project conditions, the projected volumes at the
intersection would not meet thresholds that warrant signalization. Therefore, based on the City's impact
criteria and signal warrant analysis, the proposed project alternatives would not result in a significant
impact at the Sutter Boulevard and Cochrane Plaza intersection.


Year 2030 Cumulative General Plan Amendment Impacts on
Intersection Levels of Service
An analysis of long-term Year 2030 Cumulative General Plan Amendment traffic impacts on the citywide
transportation system associated with the proposed land use amendment for the project site as well as all
other proposed General Plan Amendments (GPAs) in the City of Morgan Hill also was completed. In total,
nine land use amendments (including the proposed Mixed-Use Development Alternative) and two
roadway network amendments were included in this analysis.
The level of service results under Year 2030 Cumulative General Plan Amendment without and with
project conditions show that, one unsignalized intersection, Sutter Boulevard and Cochrane Plaza, would
                                                                                    Page|x

operate at unacceptable levels during Year 2030 Cumulative General Plan Amendment without and with
project conditions, for both project alternatives, during the PM peak hour when measured against the City
of Morgan Hill level of service standards. However, peak-hour traffic signal warrant checks indicate that
the Sutter Boulevard and Cochrane Plaza intersection would not have traffic volumes under Year 2030
Cumulative General Plan Amendment without and with project conditions for both project alternatives that
meet thresholds that warrant signalization. Therefore, based on the City's impact criteria and signal
warrant analysis, the proposed project alternatives would not result in a significant impact at the Sutter
Boulevard and Cochrane Plaza intersection.

1.       Introduction
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed Marketplace at
Cochrane Village project in Morgan Hill, California. The vacant 20.25-acre project site is located along the
south side of Cochrane Road between Butterfield Boulevard and Sutter Boulevard.
The project as proposed includes two project alternatives consisting of retail and residential land use
components. The two project alternatives analyzed within this study are the following:
Commercial Development Alternative: 160,200 square feet (s.f.) of retail space (big box), 10,000 s.f. of
ancillary retail space, 10,000 s.f. tire store, 6,400 s.f. of quality restaurant space, and 6,100 s.f. of fast
food restaurant space.
Mixed-Use Development Alternative: Up to 260 residential units,18,500 s.f. of retail space, and 10,000
s.f. day care center that can serve up to 120 students. The mixed-use development alternative may
include an additional 10,000 s.f. of retail space in lieu if the day care center. A comparison of trip
generation estimates for day care centers and retail space indicates that the proposed day care center
would generate a greater amount of trips than the potential 10,000 s.f. of retail space. Therefore, this
analysis includes the evaluation of the proposed day care center since it will result in the greatest amount
of additional traffic.
Under the commercial development scenario, Cochrane Road, Butterfield Boulevard, and Jarvis Drive will
provide direct vehicle access to the project site. One driveway along Cochrane Road would serve as the
main entrance to the project site. Two secondary driveways onto Cochrane Road also would serve the
project site. One driveway onto Butterfield Boulevard and three driveways onto Jarvis Drive also would
provide access to the project site. Additionally, the parking lot of the proposed project would connect to
the parking lot of the existing commercial development located just east of the project
site. Therefore, vehicles could also indirectly access the project site using the driveways serving the
adjacent existing commercial development, which is accessed by one driveway along Sutter Boulevard
and one driveway along Jarvis Drive.

Under the mixed-use development scenario, Cochrane Road and Jarvis Drive will provide direct vehicle
access to the project site. The main driveway along Cochrane Road would provide access to both the
residential and commercial uses. Two secondary driveways (right-in and out access only) along Cochrane
Road also would serve the commercial uses on site. A driveway onto Jarvis Drive would provide access
to the proposed residences. Additionally, the parking lot serving the proposed building located at the
northeast corner of the project site would connect to the parking lot of the existing commercial
development located just east of the project site. Therefore, vehicles could also indirectly access this
portion of the project site using the driveways serving the adjacent existing commercial development,
which consist of one driveway along Sutter Boulevard and one driveway along Jarvis Drive.

The project site location and the surrounding study area are shown on Figure 1. Site plans for each of the
project alternatives analyzed are shown on Figures 2 and 3.

Scope of Study
The potential impacts related to the proposed development were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the City of Morgan Hill and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA). The VTA administers the County Congestion Management Program (CMP). The study includes an
analysis of AM and PM peak-hour traffic conditions for 19 signalized intersections, six unsignalized
intersections, and seven freeway segments. The study also includes a site access analysis, which
includes levels of service analysis, signal warrant analysis, sight distance analysis, and vehicle-storage
requirements at the proposed project access points.
The study intersections and freeway segments are identified below.

hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the most congested traffic
conditions occur on a typical weekday. Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
Scenario 1:    Existing Conditions. Existing conditions were represented by existing peak-hour traffic
               volumes on the existing roadway network. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from
               recent traffic counts and recently completed traffic studies in the project area.
Scenario 2:    Existing Plus Project Conditions. Project-generated traffic volumes were added to existing
               traffic volumes to estimate existing plus project conditions. Existing plus project conditions
               were evaluated relative to existing conditions in order to determine potential project
               impacts. Existing plus project conditions were evaluated for both project alternatives.
Scenario 3:    Year 2015 Cumulative Conditions. Year 2015 Cumulative conditions represent future
               traffic volumes on the future transportation network. Year 2015 Cumulative conditions
               include traffic growth projected to occur in the Year 2015 without the project.
Scenario 4:    Year 2015 Cumulative with Project Conditions. Year 2015 Cumulative with project consists
               of Year 2015 Cumulative traffic conditions with the addition of project traffic.
Scenario 5:    Year 2030 General Plan Conditions. Year 2030 General Plan conditions represent future
               traffic volumes on the future transportation network. Year 2030 General Plan conditions
               includes land use growth and transportation improvements associated with buildout of the
               City's General Plan as identified in the City's 2010 General Plan Circulation Element.
Scenario 6:    Year 2030 General Plan Amendment with Project Conditions. Year 2030 General Plan
               with project consists of Year 2030 General Plan traffic conditions with the addition of traffic
               due the proposed land use amendment of the project.
Scenario 7:    Year 2030 Cumulative General Plan Amendment Conditions. Year 2030 Cumulative
               General Plan Amendment conditions represent future traffic volumes on the future
               transportation network. Year 2030 Cumulative General Plan Amendment conditions
               includes land use growth and transportation improvements associated with buildout of the
               City's General Plan as identified in the City's 2010 General Plan Circulation Element as
               well as all proposed General Plan land use and roadway network amendments within the
               City.
Scenario 8:    Year 2030 Cumulative General Plan Amendment with Project Conditions. Year 2030
               Cumulative General Plan Amendment with project consists of Year 2030 Cumulative
               General Plan Amendment traffic conditions with the addition of traffic due the proposed
               land use amendment of the project.


Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described
above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable
level of service standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from new peak hour intersection turn-movement counts
(conducted in October 2012), previous traffic studies, the City of Morgan Hill, and field observations. The
following data were collected from these sources:

    existing traffic volumes
    lane configurations
    signal timing and phasing
    Year 2015 traffic forecasts
    Year 2030 traffic forecasts

Analysis Methodologies and Level of Service Standards
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service
is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or
no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The analysis methods are described
below.

Signalized Intersections
Signalized study intersections are subject to the City of Morgan Hill level of service standards. The City of
Morgan Hill level of service methodology is TRAFFIX, which is based on the 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM) method for signalized intersections. TRAFFIX evaluates signalized intersections
operations based on average delay time for all vehicles at the intersection. Since TRAFFIX is also the
CMP-designated intersections level of service methodology, the City of Morgan Hill methodology employs
the CMP defaults values for the analysis parameters, which include adjusted saturation flow rates to
reflect conditions in Santa Clara County. All intersections within the City of Morgan Hill are required to
meet the City's LOS standard of LOS D, with the exception of the following:

        LOS F for Downtown intersections and segments including at Main/Monterey, along Monterey
        Road between Main and Fifth Street, and along Depot Street at First through Fifth Street;

        LOS E for the following intersections and freeway zones:

                 Main Avenue and Del Monte Avenue
                 Main Avenue and Depot Street
                 Dunne Avenue and Del Monte Avenue
                 Dunne Avenue and Monterey Avenue
                 Dunne Avenue and Church Street
                 Dunne Avenue and Depot Street
                 Cochrane Road and Monterey Road
                 Tennant Avenue and Monterey Road
                 Tennant Avenue and Butterfield Boulevard
                 Cochrane Road Freeway Zone: from Madrone Parkway/Cochrane Plaza to Cochrane
                 Road/DePaul Drive
                 Dunne Avenue Freeway Zone: from Walnut Grove Drive/East Dunne Avenue to Condit
                 Road/East Dunne Avenue
                 Tennant Avenue Freeway Zone: from Butterfield Boulevard/Tennant Avenue to Condit
                 Road/Tennant Avenue
The correlation between average delay and level of service for signalized intersections is shown in Table
1.

Unsignalized Intersections
The methodology used to determine the level of service for unsignalized intersections is also TRAFFIX
and the 2000 HCM methodology for unsignalized intersection analysis. This method is applicable for both
two-way and all-way stop-controlled intersections. For the analysis of stop-controlled intersections, the
2000 HCM methodology evaluates intersection operations on the basis of average control delay time for
all vehicles on the stop-controlled approaches. For the purpose of reporting level of service for one- and
two-way stop-controlled intersections, the delay and corresponding level of service for the stop-controlled
minor street approach with the highest delay is reported. For all-way stop-controlled intersections, the
reported average delay and corresponding level of service is the average for all approaches at the
intersection. The City uses a minimum acceptable level of service standard of LOS D for unsignalized
intersections, in accordance with its adopted threshold of significance in its Guidelines for Preparation of
Transportation Impact Reports. The correlation between average delay and level of service for
unsignalized intersections is shown in Table 2.

Signal Warrants
The level of service analysis at unsignalized intersections is supplemented with an assessment of the
need for signalization of the intersection. The need for signalization of unsignalized intersections is
assessed based on the Peak Hour Volume Warrant (Warrant 3) described in the California Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (CA MUTCD), Part 4, Highway Traffic Signals,
2010. This method makes no evaluation of intersection level of service, but simply provides an indication
whether vehicular peak hour traffic volumes are, or would be, sufficient to justify installation of a traffic
signal. The decision to install a traffic signal should not be based purely on the warrants alone. Instead,
the installation of a signal should be considered and further analysis performed when one or more of the
warrants are met. Additionally, engineering judgment is exercised on a case-by-case basis to evaluate
the effect a traffic signal will have on certain types of accidents and traffic conditions at the subject
intersection as well as at adjacent intersections. Intersections that meet the peak hour warrant are subject
to further analysis before determining that a traffic signal is necessary. Other options such as traffic
control devices, signage, or geometric changes may be preferable based on existing field conditions.

Freeway Segments
As prescribed in the CMP technical guidelines, the level of service for freeway segments is estimated
based on vehicle density. Density is calculated by the following formula:
                 D = V / (N*S)
        Where:
                 D= density, in vehicles per mile per lane (vpmpl)
                 V= peak hour volume, in vehicles per hour (vph)
                 N= number of travel lanes
                 S= average travel speed, in miles per hour (mph)

The vehicle density on a segment is correlated to level of service as shown in Table 3. The CMP specifies
that a capacity of 2,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) be used for mixed-flow lane segments that are
three lanes or wider in one direction, and a capacity of 2,200 vphpl be used for mixed-flow lane segments
that are two lanes wide in one direction. A capacity of 1,650 vphpl was used for high occupancy vehicle
(HOV) lanes. The CMP defines an acceptable level of service for freeway segments as LOS E or better.

Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities in the vicinity of
the site, including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities.


Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the project site is provided via US 101. Local access to the site is provided by
Cochrane Road, Monterey Road, Butterfield Boulevard, Jarvis Drive, and Sutter Boulevard. These
facilities are described below.
US 101 is a north-south freeway extending northward to San Francisco and southward through Gilroy. US
101 is an eight-lane freeway (three mixed-flow lanes and one high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in each
direction) north of Cochrane Road. South of Cochrane Road, it is a six-lane freeway with no HOV lanes.
Existing access to and from the project area is provided via an interchange at Cochrane Road.
Cochrane Road is an east-west divided roadway that runs from Monterey Road to Malaguerra Avenue,
east of US 101. Cochrane Road is a four-lane road between Monterey Road and Sutter Boulevard.
Between Sutter Boulevard and US 101, Cochrane Road widens to three-lanes eastbound and two lanes
westbound, then narrows back to four lanes east of US 101, and to two lanes east of Mission View Drive.
Cochrane Road has a posted speed limit of 45 miles-per-hour (mph). It runs along the northern project
frontage and would provide direct access to the project site via various driveways.
Monterey Road is a four-lane divided major arterial that runs directly through Morgan Hill. Monterey Road
extends from Market Street in downtown San Jose, to US 101 south of the City of Gilroy. Monterey Road
runs west of the project site with a posted speed limit of 45 mph.
Butterfield Boulevard is a four-lane roadway that runs southward from Cochrane Road to Tennant Avenue
with a posted speed limit of 35 mph. The extension of Butterfield Boulevard from Tennant Avenue to
Watsonville Road/Monterey Road is currently underway with expected completion in 2013. Direct access
to the project site would be provided via a driveway along Butterfield Boulevard with the commercial
development alternative only.
Jarvis Drive is a two-lane undivided roadway that runs in a concentric form within the area bounded by
Monterey Road, Cochrane Road, US 101, and Main Avenue. It begins at Monterey Road and extends
eastward past Sutter Boulevard at which point it loops around extends southwest to Butterfield Boulevard.
Jarvis Drive is the southern project boundary and would provide direct access to the project site via
various driveways.
Sutter Boulevard is a four-lane roadway that runs from Butterfield Boulevard to Woodview Avenue just
north of Cochrane Road, with a posted speed limit of 35-mph. Indirect access would be provided to the

project site from Sutter Boulevard via an existing driveway that serves the existing commercial
development east of the project site.


Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
There are several bike lanes and bike paths in the vicinity of the project site. Monterey Road has bike
lanes along nearly its entire length within City of Morgan Hill limits, with the exception of the segment that
runs through downtown between Dunne Avenue and Main Avenue. Bike lanes also are provided along
the entire lengths of Cochrane Road, Butterfield Boulevard, and Sutter Boulevard. The existing bicycle
facilities within the study area are shown on Figure 4.
Sidewalks are provided along the south side of Cochrane Road between Monterey Road and US 101.
There are no sidewalks provided along the north side of Cochrane Road between Monterey Road and
just east of Butterfield Boulevard. Sidewalks are provided along both sides of the extent of Butterfield
Boulevard. Sidewalks are provided along the north side of Jarvis Drive, however the sidewalk is
intermittent along the project frontage. Sidewalks are provided along Sutter Boulevard between Cochrane
Road and Jarvis Road, however no sidewalks are provided south of Jarvis Road.


Existing Transit Service
Existing transit service to the study area is provided by the VTA and Caltrain. The nearest bus stops to
the project site are located on Cochrane Road, at the intersection with Sutter Boulevard and west of
Butterfield Boulevard. The transit services are described below and shown on Figure 5.
The study area is served directly by one local bus (Community Bus Route 16) and two express buses
(Express Routes 121 and 168). In addition, Bus Route 68 operates along Monterey Road in the project
area.
Community Bus Route 16 operates on Cochrane Road in the study area. It runs from Burnett Avenue to
the Civic Center in Morgan Hill with approximately 60-minute headways in the AM and PM peak hours.
Route 16 operates between 6:30 AM and 6:00 PM. The nearest Route 16 stops to the project site are
located near the intersections of Cochrane Road and Butterfield Boulevard.
Local Route 68 operates on Monterey Road in the study area. It runs from the Gilroy Transit Center to
the Diridon Transit Center in San Jose with 15-20 minute headways on weekdays in the AM and PM peak
hours. Route 68 operates between 4:00 AM and 1:30 AM. The nearest Route 68 stop to the project site is
located at the Main and Hale Avenue Transit Center.
Express Route 121 operates on Cochrane Road on its route between the Gilroy Transit Center and the
Lockheed Martin Transit Center. It operates northbound with 30-minute headways during the AM peak
hours and southbound with 30 to 55 minute headways during the PM peak hours. The nearest stop to the
project site is located at the intersection of Cochrane Road and Sutter Boulevard.

Existing Intersection Lane Configurations
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were determined by observations in the field
and are shown on Figure 6.


Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing peak-hour traffic volumes were obtained from recently completed traffic studies in the area and
new peak hour counts collected in October 2012. The existing peak-hour intersection volumes are shown
on Figure 7. Intersection turning-movement counts conducted for this analysis are presented in Appendix
A.


Existing Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in Table 4. The
results show that, measured against the City of Morgan Hill level of service standards, all the study
intersections currently operate at an acceptable level of service under existing conditions during each of
the peak hours analyzed. The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix C.


Existing Freeway Segment Levels of Service
Traffic volumes for the subject freeway segments were obtained from the 2011 CMP Annual Monitoring
Report. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 5. The results show that the mixed-flow lanes
on one of the fourteen directional freeway segments analyzed (northbound US 101, from Tenant Avenue
to East Dunne Avenue) currently operates at an unacceptable LOS F during the AM peak hour. All other
freeway segments analyzed operate at LOS E or better conditions during the AM and PM peak hours.

Existing Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes existing plus project traffic conditions, significant project impacts, and measures
that are recommended to mitigate project impacts. Included are descriptions of the significance criteria
that define an impact, estimates of project-generated traffic, identification of the impacts, and descriptions
of the mitigation measures. Existing plus project conditions are represented by existing traffic conditions
with the addition of traffic generated by the proposed project.


Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. Significance criteria for impacts on
intersections for this analysis are based on the City of Morgan Hill and CMP Level of Service standards.

Definition of Significant Signalized Intersection Impacts
All intersections within the City of Morgan Hill are required to meet the City's LOS standard of LOS D, with
the exception of the following:

           LOS F for Downtown intersections and segments including at Main/Monterey, along Monterey
           Road between Main and Fifth Street, and along Depot Street at First through Fifth Street;

           LOS E for the following intersections and freeway zones:

                       Main Avenue and Del Monte Avenue
                       Main Avenue and Depot Street
                       Dunne Avenue and Del Monte Avenue
                       Dunne Avenue and Monterey Avenue
                       Dunne Avenue and Church Street;
                       Dunne Avenue and Depot Street
                       Cochrane Road and Monterey Road
                       Tennant Avenue and Monterey Road
                       Tennant Avenue and Butterfield Boulevard
                       Cochrane Road Freeway Zone: from Madrone Parkway/Cochrane Plaza to Cochrane
                       Road/DePaul Drive
                       Dunne Avenue Freeway Zone: from Walnut Grove Drive/East Dunne Avenue to Condit
                       Road/East Dunne Avenue
                       Tennant Avenue Freeway Zone: from Butterfield Boulevard/Tennant Avenue to Condit
                       Road/Tennant Avenue
According to the City of Morgan Hill level of service guidelines, a development is said to create a
significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection if for either peak hour:


                                                                               Page|22  
Marketplace at Cochrane Village                                                                                       June 7, 2013 


1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable level (LOS D or LOS E as
   identified above) under existing conditions to an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) under project
   conditions, or
2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable level (LOS E or F as identified above)
   under existing conditions and the addition of project trips causes the average critical delay to increase
   by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by 0.01.
An exception to this rule applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average delay
for critical movements (i.e., the change in average delay for critical movements is negative). In this case,
the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by 0.01 or more.

Definition of Significant Unsignalized Intersection Impacts
Unsignalized intersections within the City of Morgan Hill have a minimum operating level of LOS D.
According to the City of Morgan Hill level of service guidelines, a development is said to have a significant
adverse impact on traffic conditions at an unsignalized intersection if for either peak hour the addition of
project traffic causes the worst approach delay to degrade to LOS E or F and the traffic volumes at the
intersection are sufficiently high to satisfy the peak hour volume warrant.

CMP Definition of Significant Freeway Segment Impacts
A project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions on a CMP freeway segment if
for either peak hour:
           1. The level of service on the freeway segment is an unacceptable LOS F under project condi-
              tions, and the number of project trips on that segment constitutes at least one percent of
              capacity on that segment.
           2. The level of service on the freeway segment degrades from an acceptable LOS E or better
              under existing conditions to an unacceptable LOS F under project conditions.
A significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore freeway conditions to LOS E or better.


Transportation Network under Existing Plus Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the roadway network and intersection configurations under existing plus
project conditions would be the same as described under existing conditions.


Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear are estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site is
estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution step, an estimate is made
of the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment step, the
project trips are assigned to specific streets and intersections in the study area. These procedures are
described further in the following sections.

Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate to common land uses their
propensity for producing traffic. Thus, for the most common land uses there are standard trip generation


                                                                               Page|23  
Marketplace at Cochrane Village                                                                                       June 7, 2013 


rates that can be applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new
development.
Hexagon has prepared project trip estimates for the proposed project based on trip generation rates
obtained from the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE's) Trip Generation Manual, Ninth Edition,
2012. Two project alternatives were analyzed:
Commercial Development Alternative: 160,200 s.f. of retail space (big box), 10,000 s.f. of ancillary retail
space, 10,000 s.f. tire store, 6,400 s.f. of quality restaurant space, and 6,100 s.f. of fast food restaurant
space.
Mixed-Use Development Alternative: Up to 260 residential units,18,500 s.f. of retail space, and 10,000 s.f.
day care center that can serve up to 120 students. The mixed-use development alternative may include
an additional 10,000 s.f. of retail space in lieu if the day care center. A comparison of trip generation
estimates for day care centers and retail space indicates that the proposed day care center would
generate a greater amount of trips than the potential 10,000 s.f. of retail space. Therefore, this analysis
includes the evaluation of the proposed day care center since it will result in the greatest amount of
additional traffic.
Trip generation for retail uses is typically adjusted to account for pass-by-trips. Pass-by-trips are trips that
would already be on the adjacent roadways (and are therefore already counted in the existing traffic) but
would turn into the site while passing by. Justification for applying the pass-by-trip reduction is founded on
the observation that such retail traffic is not actually generated by the retail development, but is already
part of the ambient traffic levels. Pass-by-trips are therefore excluded from the traffic projections (although
pass-by traffic is accounted for at the site entrances). A pass-by trip reduction of 20% was applied to the
retail/commercial component of the proposed project as recommended by ITE's Trip Generation
Handbook.
Additionally, mixed-use reductions to account for the interaction of the proposed land uses were applied.
The reductions are based on the assumption that vehicle trips to each of the proposed land uses of the
site would be reduced due to internal circulation (i.e. residents patronizing the proposed retail space). A
reduction of 15% was applied for the internalization of trips associated with residential and retail uses, as
recommended by the VTA's Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines, January 2009. The project trip
generation estimates for each of the project alternatives analyzed are presented in Tables 6 and 7.

Commercial Development Alternative
Based on the ITE trip generation rates and reductions for pass-by-trips, it is estimated that the
Commercial Development Alternative would generate 7,895 daily trips, with 413 trips (227 inbound and
186 outbound) occurring during the AM peak hour and 514 trips (266 inbound and 248 outbound)
occurring during the PM peak hour.

Mixed-Use Development Alternative
On the basis of the ITE trip generation rates and reductions for mixed-use development and pass-by-
trips, it is estimated that the Mixed-Use Development Alternative would generate 3,917 daily trips, with
352 trips (146 inbound and 206 outbound) occurring during the AM peak hour and 321 trips (184 inbound
and 137 outbound) occurring during the PM peak hour.

/a/ Based on the ITE Trip Generation Manual, a 20% PM peak-hour pass-by reduction was applied to the following land uses: drive-thru fast food, specialty retail center, and department store.
/b/ The AM peak-hour trip generation rate for specialty retail center is not available in the ITE Trip Generation Manual. Therefore, the AM peak-hour rate for specialty retail center was derived
     by multiplying the AM peak-hour rate of shopping center (820) by the ratio of the PM peak-hour trip generation rates of specialty retail center and shopping center.
/c/ The average trip generation rate from the ITE Trip Generation Manual was used for all land uses.

/a/ A reduction of 15% was applied for internalization between retail and residential uses. The reduction was based on the smaller trip generator, which is the residential use, (as prescribed by VTA Guidelines).
/b/ Based on the ITE Trip Generation Manual, a 20% PM peak-hour pass-by reduction was applied to the retail and restaurant uses.
/c/ The average trip generation rate from the ITE Trip Generation Manual was used for all land uses.
/d/ The AM peak-hour trip generation rate for specialty retail center is not available in the ITE Trip Generation Manual. Therefore, the AM peak-hour rate for specialty retail center was derived
     by multiplying the AM peak-hour rate of shopping center (820) by the ratio of the PM peak-hour trip generation rates of specialty retail center and shopping center.

Trip Distribution
Peak hour project traffic was distributed to the transportation network using two separate distribution
patterns, one for the trips associated with the proposed residential land uses and a second for trips
associated with the proposed retail land uses. Both trip distribution patterns are based on existing travel
patterns on the surrounding roadway system and the locations of complementary land uses. The project
trip distribution patterns are shown graphically on Figure 8.

Trip Assignment
The peak-hour trips associated with the proposed project were added to the transportation network
in accordance with the distribution patterns discussed above. Figures 9 and 10 show the
assignment of project traffic on the local transportation network for each of the project alternatives.
A tabular summary of project traffic at each study intersection is contained in Appendix B.


Existing Plus Project Traffic Volumes
Project trips for each of the alternatives, as represented in the above project trip assignment, were
added to the existing traffic volumes to obtain existing plus project traffic volumes. The existing
plus project traffic volumes are shown on Figures 11 and 12.


Existing Plus Project Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions are summarized in Table
8. The results show that, measured against the City of Morgan Hill level of service standards, all the study
intersections, with the exception of Woodview Avenue and Cochrane Road, are projected to operate at
acceptable levels of service under existing plus project conditions during each of the peak hours analyzed
for both project alternatives. The intersection of Woodview Avenue and Cochrane Road is projected to
operate at an unacceptable LOS E or worse during at least one peak hour, for both project alternatives
under existing plus project conditions.
The intersection of Woodview Avenue and Cochrane Road is currently unsignalized. Based on City of
Morgan Hill unsignalized intersection impact criteria, the project will have an impact at this intersection if,
in addition to deteriorating the intersection's level of service to unacceptable conditions, the peak hour
signal warrant is met at this location. Based on the Peak-Hour Volume Signal Warrant, (Warrant #3 ­ Part
B) described in the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), 2010 Edition, this
intersection would warrant installation of a traffic signal during the PM peak hour under existing plus
Commercial Development Alternative conditions. This constitutes a project impact, according to the City
of Morgan Hill level of service impact criteria. The projected traffic volumes under existing plus Mixed-Use
Development Alternative conditions would not be sufficient to warrant installation of a traffic signal.
Therefore, based on the City of Morgan Hill level of service impact criteria, the proposed Mixed-Use
Development Alternative will not have an impact at the Woodview Avenue and Cochrane Road
intersection.
The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix C, and the signal warrant checks are
included in Appendix D.

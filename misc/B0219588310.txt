Technical Memorandum ­ The Larchmont Post Build Traffic Study
Asheville, NC
Prepared for the City of Asheville
March 27, 2013

Introduction
The Larchmont is a recently constructed apartment community by Mountain Housing
Opportunities that is located on the east end of E. Larchmont Road in Asheville, NC. The
development consists of 60 dwelling units which are currently 100% occupied. Figure 1 presents a
site location map.

DAVENPORT was retained to collect traffic data to measure the amount of traffic associated with
the site and to determine how site traffic travels to and from the site (E. Larchmont Road or Long
Street). A vicinity map is provided in Figure 2 and traffic data was collected at the following
intersections:

   ·      The Larchmont Driveway & E. Larchmont Road
   ·      E. Larchmont Road & Long Street

Existing Roadway Conditions
Existing traffic volumes were collected by DAVENPORT staff. Table 1.0 below contains the dates
these counts were conducted. Full-turning movement counts were conducted during the morning
(7:00 am to 9:00 am) and afternoon (4:00 pm to 6:00 pm). Bicycle, pedestrians, and trucks were
included in the counts. Schools in the area were in session at the time of traffic counts.

                                 Table 1.0 - Traffic Volume Data
                    Count Location:                              Date Taken:            By:
    The Larchmont Driveway & E. Larchmont Road                     3/20/2013     DAVENPORT
             E. Larchmont Road & Long Street                       3/20/2013     DAVENPORT

In order to provide traffic data information pertaining to The Larchmont, traffic volumes associated
with the fire station at the end of E. Larchmont Road were excluded from the count at the
intersection of E. Larchmont Road & Long Street.

As shown, a total of 20 vehicles were observed at The Larchmont Driveway during the AM peak
and 36 vehicles were observed during the PM peak. There were seven (7) pedestrians observed at
this driveway during the AM peak and no bikes. During the PM peak, there were six (6) pedestrians
observed and no bikes.

Figure 3 shows existing AM and PM peak hour volumes. The full reports for these volumes can be
found attached with this report.

Trip Generation Comparison
Trip generation projections are typically estimated based on the Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual. The trip generation estimate based on ITE for The
Larchmont (utilizing the ITE Trip Generation software) is provided in Table 2.0. As shown, the
development is projected to generate a total of 34 trips during the AM peak and 51 trips during the
PM peak.

During the data collection, five (5) entering vehicles and 15 exiting vehicles were observed during
the AM peak. There were 23 entering vehicles and 13 exiting vehicles observed during the PM peak.
Compared to the ITE projections, the field observations result in 14 fewer trips during the AM peak
and 15 fewer trips in the PM peak. Table 3.0 provides a comparison of the ITE estimates versus the
field observations.

Utilization of E. Larchmont Road versus Long Street
As previously discussed, turning movement count information was collected at the intersection of
The Larchmont Driveway & E. Larchmont Road. Traffic associated with the adjacent fire station
was excluded from the count. As shown in Figure 3, the majority of project traffic utilized E.
Larchmont Road to enter and exit the site. During the AM peak, only two (2) entering and three (3)
exiting site trips were observed to travel on Long Street. During the PM peak, only six (6) entering
and one (1) exiting site trips were observed to travel on Long Street.

Conclusion
In conclusion, DAVENPORT has collected traffic data at the intersections of The Larchmont
Driveway & E. Larchmont Road and E. Larchmont Road & Long Street. The purpose of this study
was to measure the amount of traffic associated with the site and to determine how site traffic
travels to and from the site (E. Larchmont Road or Long Street).

This assessment has found that the observed site traffic was lower than the projected trip generation
based on ITE. Furthermore, the majority of site related traffic was observed to utilize E. Larchmont
Road to enter and exit the site, as opposed to Long Street. It should be noted that this technical
memorandum is intended to provide information regarding the traffic data collection and does not
provide any recommendations.

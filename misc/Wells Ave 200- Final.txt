                                                                                             Page 2 of 7

                                     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The site, situated at 200 Wells Avenue, is located in the Wells Avenue Office Park, a mature
commercial and limited manufacturing office park dating back to the late 1960s. The site is
subject to a number of special permits including Board Order #188-79, which allowed for the
construction of the existing commercial office building and parking areas. Properties in the
Wells Avenue Office Park are also subject to a 99-year deed restriction (exercised by the City, in
June of 1969) that imposes a number of conditions on the development and use of these
properties.

The Russian School of Mathematics (RSM) specializes in the teaching of mathematics after-
school for grades K-12. RSM is a private for-profit educational use that has operated on-site
since receiving a special permit in 2006 via Board Order #325-06. RSM received a special
permit for the location of a for-profit educational use in the Limited Manufacturing District, to
waive various parking requirements including the number of parking stalls, and for two
freestanding signs. Conditions to Board Order #325-06 limited the petitioner's operations at
the site including the number of students per class, the number of employees on-site at any
time, the maximum number of students on-site at any time, the hours of operations, and drop-
off and pick-up operations.

The Inspectional Services Department cited RSM in January 2013 for two sheds that had been
constructed illegally on site, as well as for various operational issues; the school has been very
successful and is operating beyond the scope of many of the limiting conditions of Board Order
#325-06.

To accommodate current operations and to allow for some limited future growth the petitioner
is seeking modifications to many of the condition of Board Order #325-06 as follows:
     · To allow up to 200 students in the school at any given time
     · To allow for up to 15 students per class
     · To allow for up to 17 classes to occur at any one time
     · To allow for up to 28 employees on-site at any one time

To accommodate the proposed intensity of the use the petitioner is proposing to amend the
current site plan to connect the two separate parking areas with a driveway in order to
facilitate parking operations. RSM is also proposing to construct a new fenced-in play area and
to legalize the existing noncompliant storage sheds on-site.

The proposed new driveway will enable additional live drop-off of students and remove any
queuing from occurring on Wells Avenue, and the Planning Department has no concerns with
this proposed change. The Planning Department has no major concerns with either the sheds
or the proposed play area. The petitioner submitted a Traffic Assessment Memorandum
                                                                    Petition #325-06(3), 200 Wells Ave.
                                                                                            Page 3 of 7

(ATTACHMENT A) and a Parking Assessment (ATTACHMENT B) which appear to support the
petitioner's request for modifications to the existing Board Order and site plan.

The expansion of a business in this location is consistent with the 2007 Newton Comprehensive
Plan, which supports strengthening viable businesses that contribute to the vitality of Newton.
RSM has been very successful at this location and offers a service that is valued by many in the
City. The Planning Department suggests the petitioner seek ways to incentivize students and staff
to reduce driving and parking demand so as to minimize any traffic and parking impacts on the
surrounding businesses.

I.    SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION
      When considering the special permits requested in this application, the Board should
      decide whether the following findings apply:
           1) There will be no nuisance or serious hazard to vehicles or pedestrians.
           2) Access to the site is appropriate for the number(s) of vehicles involved.
           3) Amending the existing site plan and Board Order #325-06 will not adversely
              affect the neighborhood.


II.   CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SITE AND NEIGHBORHOOD
      A.   Neighborhood and Zoning
           The subject property is located within the Wells Avenue Office Park, which is a
           Limited Manufacturing zoning district, containing a mix of commercial uses including
           general office, warehouse and distribution. As the office park has matured there has
           been a transition of school and sports-related uses in the area (i.e. Solomon
           Schechter Day School, Exxcel Gymnastics Academy, Boston Sports Club,
           Massachusetts School of Psychiatry, etc.).

      B.   Site
           The site contains approximately 87,131 square feet of land and is generally
           characterized as a flat, triangular parcel. The site is improved with a two-story
           ~19,000 sq. ft. brick building previously used as office space.

           The site is served by two parking areas on each side of the building. Parking Lot A
           contains 50 parking stalls, including three handicap stalls. Parking Lot B contains 14
           stalls. Although the main entrance to the building is located on the south side of the
           building close to the center of Parking Lot A, both parking areas have a pedestrian
           walkway leading from the parking areas to building entrances.
                                                                     Petition #325-06(3), 200 Wells Ave.
                                                                                             Page 4 of 7

III.   PRIMARY PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS
       A.   Land Use
            The building is a multi-tenant office building currently shared by four tenants. RSM
            occupies the bulk of the building with 7,568 square feet on the first and second
            floors. Dance Fever, Inc. (DFI) is a for-profit dance studio serving students ages four
            through adult. DFI occupies 6,672 square feet of the easterly wing of the first and
            second floors via Board Order #324-06, which includes conditions similar to RSM.
            Two commercial office tenants occupy 1,211 square feet on the second floor. All
            four tenants will continue to operate on-site.

            RSM is proposing to increase the intensity of the use of the site by amending Board
            Order #325-06, (ATTACHMENT C) including increasing the limit of students per class
            from 10 to 15; increasing the allowed number of classes on-site at one time from 10
            to 17; increasing the number of staff on-site from 10 to 28; amending the hours of
            operation from 3:30 to 2:30 on Tuesdays; staggering the class schedule such that no
            more than three weekday classes shall begin concurrently and there shall be a break
            of 10 minutes before any additional classes start; increasing the maximum number
            of students on-site at any given time from 100 to 200.

       B.   Building and Site Design
            The petitioner is not proposing any external alterations to the building at this time
            with the exception of adding a playground and legalizing two existing sheds.

            If the proposed sheds were new, the Planning Department would recommend that
            they be located towards the back of the site or behind the existing parking areas.
            However, the structures are located out of the front setback and are somewhat
            screened by existing mature trees, so the Planning Department has no major
            concerns with either the sheds or the proposed play area.

       C.   Parking and Circulation
            There are two parking lots on-site: Lot A with 50 stalls and Lot B with 14 stalls. The
            petitioner also has 24 dedicated off-site school parking spaces located on the
            adjacent lot to the south.

            Adequate queuing, circulation, parking, and safe pedestrian access through the
            parking lot are important issues central to this petition. In order to reduce traffic
            queuing and parking conflicts the petitioner is proposing to connect the two parking
            areas on-site with a one-way driveway in front of the existing building. The
            proposed new driveway will enable additional live drop-off of students and remove
            any queuing from occurring on Wells Avenue and the Planning Department has no
                                                        Petition #325-06(3), 200 Wells Ave.
                                                                                Page 5 of 7

concerns with this proposed change. Connecting the lots would result in the loss of
two parking stalls. No other changes are proposed to the existing parking area.

The petitioner received a parking waiver of 12 stalls in 2006. However, due to the
reduction of office space between then and now, a parking waiver is no longer
required as RSM (serving students under 14) has a lower parking requirement than
the office use. The petitioner also received a number of parking waivers for the
existing parking facilities in 2006:
    · to reduce the minimum required aisle width from 24 ft. to 19.8 ft. in Parking
        Lot A;
    · to install guardrail instead of curbing in Parking Lot A;
    · to reduce the minimum required aisle width from 24 ft. to 23.6 ft. for Parking
        Lot B;
    · to reduce the front setback from 25 ft. to 23.6 ft. for Parking Lot B;
    · to reduce the required end stall turn-out depth from 5 ft. to 3.5 ft. for
        Parking Lot B;
    · to continue existing perimeter and interior landscaping for Parking Lots A &
        B; and
    · to continue existing lighting installation, to allow reduced illumination below
        1 ft. candle to the extent necessary for Parking Lots A & B.

The Planning Department recommends that the petitioner submit a directional sign
package to address the change in traffic flow at the entrance of both lots indicating
drop-off and parking for different uses. Parents also should be advised of parking
and drop-off and pick-up policies in writing on a regular basis.

The petitioner submitted a Traffic Assessment Memorandum and a Parking
Assessment, which appear to support the petitioner's request for modifications to
the existing Board Order and site plan. The Traffic Assessment Memorandum
recommends trimming existing trees along the site frontage, relocating the stop sign
approximately two to four feet behind the sidewalk, relocating the freestanding
sign, and restricting parking along the south side of Well Avenue in the area of the
site frontage would improve sight lines for vehicles exiting the site.

Traffic and parking management practices have also recently been improved with
the addition of a police detail at peak hours and employing a parking lot attendant
to facilitate pick-up and drop-off. Proposed modifications to accommodate a one-
way prop-off and pick-up lane along the front of the existing building will also
facilitate operations on-site.

The Parking Assessment shows that there is sufficient parking on site to
                                                                    Petition #325-06(3), 200 Wells Ave.
                                                                                            Page 6 of 7

           accommodate the proposed number of students and teachers. The majority of
           students in RSM are under 14 and are driven by car to the school, dropped off and
           picked up when the sessions are over. This study also notes that the peak hour for
           RSM is form 5-6 p.m., which does not conflict with the peak hours of DFI which are
           after 6 p.m. RSM and DFI should seek ways to incentivize students and staff to
           carpool in order minimize any traffic and parking impacts on the surrounding
           businesses.

IV.   COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
      The 2007 Comprehensive Plan asserts that Newton's economic development success
      depends upon the City succeeding as both an attractive residential living environment and
      as a desirable location for business. The expansion of this successful educational use
      appears to further the goals of the Newton Comprehensive Plan, by providing useful
      services that are desired by the community, as long as all parking and queuing issues can
      be contained on-site.

V.    TECHNICAL REVIEW
      A.   Technical Considerations. The Zoning Review Memorandum, dated May 21, 2013
           (ATTACHMENT D), provides an analysis of the proposal with regard to zoning.

      B.   Engineering Division Review. The Associate City Engineer's Review Memorandum is
           attached (ATTACHMENT E). All issues can be addressed prior to the issuance of a
           building permit.

VI.   ZONING RELIEF SOUGHT
      Based on the completed Zoning Review Memorandum the petitioners are seeking approval
      through or relief from:
           ·   Section 30-23 to amend the existing site plan of record
           ·   Section 30-24 to amend Board Order #325-06.

VII. PETITIONERS' RESPONSBILITIES
      Prior to being scheduled for a working session the petitioner should submit a directional
      signage package and RSM and DFI should seek ways to incentivize students and staff to
      carpool in order minimize any traffic and parking impacts on the surrounding businesses.

             Introduction 
             This memo has been prepared to provide a review of existing traffic conditions at the Russian School of 
             Mathematics (RSM) and Dance Fever site located at 200 Wells Avenue, as well as future conditions evaluation 
             with the proposed site modifications and operational protocols in place. Currently the school portion of the 
             facility is permitted for up to 10 students per class room.  Based on information provided by the Proponent, 
             current enrollment is beyond the permitted levels. To accommodate the current operations of the school and to 
             allow for some limited future growth, the applicant is seeking modification to its special permit to allow: 
              
             ·  up to 200 students in the school at any given time 
             ·  up to a maximum of 15 students per class 
             ·  up to 17 classes to occur at any one time 
             ·  up to 28 employees on site at any one time 
              
             As part of the permitting necessary to continue operations at this location and support the request that is being made, 
             modifications to the existing site plan and the introduction of a traffic circulation and parking management plan, 
             including protocols for afternoon dropoff/pickup and general site circulation has become necessary and is being 
             proposed. The focus of this document is to assess the traffic access and operational conditions only. It should be noted 
             that a separate and distinct parking assessment has been completed by Planning Horizons and is included under 
             separate heading within the application. 
              
             Under existing conditions, the property has two full access driveways and parking areas along Wells, one on the 
             east (parking lot B) and west side of the building (parking lot A). Parking lot A driveway provides access to the 
             primary parking area for the site and includes a total of 49 parking spaces. Parking lot B driveway provides 
             access to approximately 14 parking spaces. This area is designated for student drop off only and there is a 5 
             minute parking limitation. Currently the eastern and western driveways/parking areas are not connected. As 
             part of revisions to the site being considered under this application, a parent dropoff and pickup connector 
             roadway is being proposed which would connect the two parking areas. This connector road would be oneway 
             from west to east and will be used exclusively for the purpose of parent dropoff and pickup only (no extended 
             parking). 
              
             Weekly classes and instruction for activities at both RSM and Dance Fever primarily occur between 3:00 pm and 
             9:00 pm on weekdays and between 8:00 am and 7 pm on weekends.  Most of the existing programs are geared 
             toward the school age population with Dance Fever offering some later evening classes for adults.  The vast 
             majority of students in both schools are driven to the facility and droppedoff/pickedup when the session is

    over.  Carpooling is encouraged and frequently more than one child per household is enrolled in concurrent 
    classes. 
     
    Safety Assessment 
    To identify potential vehicle crash trends at the two site driveways, reported vehicular crash data for the study
    area intersections was obtained from MassDOT for the years 2006 through 2010, the most recent fiveyear 
    history available. A summary of the MassDOT vehicle crash history and crash rates is presented in Table 1. This 
    data is contained in the Attachments for reference.  
     
    The 2010 MassDOT average crash rates for unsignalized intersections for District 6 is 0.58. As shown in Table 1, 
    the only site driveway with recorded crashes is the Lot B driveway location which observed a total of 2 accidents 
    over the 5 years of date that was reviewed.

Project No.:  12350.00 
      
    Based on the crash data, it can be concluded that neither site driveway currently has significant crash frequency. 
    In addition, based on anecdotal information provided by the Proponent, there are no known or perceived safety 
    issues associated with access and operations of the site driveways. 
     
    Existing Traffic Conditions 
    For the purpose of assessing existing and future traffic conditions at the site driveway and along Wells Avenue in 
    the vicinity of the site, manual turning movement and automatic traffic recorder counts were conducted. 
    Specifically, manual turning movement counts were conducted at each site driveway between the hours of 24 PM 
    on a weekday to capture key parent dropoff and pickup periods in April of 2013. All traffic count sheets are 
    included in the appendix of this document along with networks of the peak traffic activity at the site driveways 
    during the afternoon peak period. In addition, an automatic traffic recorder (ATR) count was conducted along Wells 
    Avenue in front of the site for 48 hour period. The ATR count collected both vehicular movement and vehicle 
    speed. A summary of the ATR count is provided below in Table 2.

    Sight Distance 
    A sight distance analysis, in conformance with guidelines of the American Association of State Highway and 
    Transportation Officials (AASHTO) was performed at the existing site access driveways on Wells Avenue. 
    Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) is the distance required for a vehicle approaching an intersection from either 
    direction to perceive, react and come to a complete stop before colliding with an object in the road, in this case 
    the exiting vehicle from a driveway. In this respect, SSD can be considered as the minimum visibility criterion for 
    the safe operation of an unsignalized intersection. 
     
    Intersection Sight Distance (ISD) is based on the time required for perception, reaction and completion of the 
    desired critical exiting maneuver (left turn) once the driver on a minor street approach decided to execute the 
    maneuver. Calculation for the critical ISD includes the time to (1) turn left, and to clear the half of the 
    intersection without conflicting with the vehicles approaching from the left; and (2) accelerate to the operating 
    speed of the roadway without causing approaching vehicles to unduly reduce their speed (in the case of the 
    rightin/rightout driveway only this portion applies). In this context, ISD can be considered as a desirable 
    visibility criterion for the safe operation of an unsignalized intersection. Essentially, while SSD is the minimum 
    distance needed to avoid collisions, ISD is the minimum distance needed so that mainline motorists will not have 
    to substantially reduce their speed due to turning vehicles. To maintain the safe operation of an unsignalized 
    intersection, ISD should be greater than or equal to the stopping sight distance, though it is desirable to meet 
    ISD requirements by themselves.  
     
    To calculate the required ISD and SSD at the existing site driveways along Wells Avenue the observed 
    85th percentile speed of 33 mph was used (even though the 85th percentile speed .WB was 28 mph). Table 3 
    summarizes the sight distance analysis.

    As outlined in Table 3, the critical stopping sight distance approaching the Lot A and Lot B driveways is 230 feet 
    which is currently met or exceeded for all movements with the exception of the eastbound approach to the LOT 
    A driveway which currently has approximately 210 feet of visibility.  As outlined in the table, current field 
    conditions fall short of meeting intersection sight distance (ISD) requirements.  Meeting the SSD requirements at 
    both driveways should be the minimum sight distance that needs to be provided although it is highly desirable 
    to meet both SSD and ISD at each location.   
     
    Existing features which limit the sight distance in this area included a horizontal curve in the roadway coupled 
    with vegetation overgrowth.  Pictures at each site driveway were taken in June 2013 to represent exiting 
    conditions.

    As shown in the photographs, it is the combination of horizontal roadway curvature and the overgrowth that 
    causes limitation in sight lines.  To improve on the existing condition, and meet the SSD requirements at a 
    minimum, clearing and pruning along the site frontage to the west of the Lot B site driveway is necessary and 
    should be completed immediately.  In addition, additional trimming on all both sides of each driveway should be 
    considered to increase the available ISD to the extent possible and practical.  To supplement clearing proposed, 
    relocating the STOP signs and accompanying stop lines closer to Wells Avenue (approximately 24 feet behind 
    sidewalk) will also have a positive influence on available sight lines, as would the relocation of panel sign located 
    immediately to the east of the east driveway.  For the purpose of demonstrating the changes required to meet 
    the SSD minimum, refer to sightdistance figure in the Appendix which outlines the areas that need to be 
    cleared to improve sight lines. 
     
    Under current conditions, parking along the south side of Wells Avenue is signed to not allow parking except on 
    Saturdays Sundays and Holidays along the site frontage.  Given the horizontal profile of the roadway in this area 
    and the need to maximize sight lines for access and egress to the site, we strongly recommend that existing 
    parking restrictions be modified to not allow parking along the south side of Wells Avenue in the area of the site 
    frontage at any time. 
     
    Site Plan Modification and Operational Protocols 
    As described earlier, as part of the permitting process for the project, long term onsite enhancements are being 
    proposed. Additionally, in the short term, the recent deployment of a police detail, employing a parking lot 
    attendant, and reopening lot B have considerably improved operational conditions on site.  Future 
    enhancements proposed include the following: 
             Modification to the existing site plan to accommodate a parent dropoff and pickup lane along the front of 
             the existing building. This controlled area will be oneway (west to east), and will be used exclusively for 
             parent drop and pickup only. 
             Protocols for access, parking, and dropoff including staggering classes that are spread by 15 minute 
             intervals. Protocols include: 
             o        Students will be dropped off and picked up in the new parent dropoff and pickup lane. This driveway 
                      connection between parking lots will allow for live parking exclusively. All other vehicles will be directed

                      to parking lot A.  Parent will have the option to park and walk their child into the school when 
                      necessary as well. 
             o        Teacher and administrators will park in lot B and, if necessary, in lot A, closest to Wells Avenue. 
             o        A parking attendant will monitor the site driveway between 3:00 and 7:00 PM on weekdays to insure 
                      student pedestrian safety and to keep traffic circulating through the parking lot. 
             o        Regular reminders will be sent to parent regarding parking procedures, pickup and dropoff protocols, 
                      and to reinforce that there shall be no parking on Wells Avenue. 
             o        Both RSM and Dance Fever will further develop and promote carpool programs that will be aimed at 
                      further reducing vehicular trips to the site. For example, reduced tuition rates and other incentives will 
                      be offered to parents who continually demonstrate viable carpooling arrangements. 
             o        Lease arrangements (temporary or long term) will be sought to allow for teacher and administrator 
                      parking based on monitoring the extent to which the above outlined improvements will address 
                      identified concerns. 
     
    Traffic Operational Analyses 
    Measuring existing traffic volumes and projecting future traffic volumes quantifies traffic within the study area. 
    To assess quality of flow, roadway capacity analyses were conducted with respect to the 2013 existing 
    conditions with the proposed site plan modification and operational protocols in place. Capacity analyses 
    provide an indication of the adequacy of the roadway facilities to serve the anticipated traffic demands. The 
    analysis summary, Table 4, contains the results of operational analyses at each site driveway with the revised 
    site plan and assumed operational protocols in place. The analysis is limited to the afternoon peak hour which is 
    the critical peak period for combination of site traffic activity and ambient background traffic volumes.

    Levelofservice (LOS) is the term used to denote the different operating conditions that occur on a given 
    roadway segment under various traffic volume loads. It is a qualitative measure of the effect of a number of 
    factors including roadway geometrics, speed, travel delay, freedom to maneuver, and safety. Levelofservice 
    provides an index to the operational qualities of a roadway segment or an intersection. Levelofservice 
    designations range from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F representing 
    the worst operating conditions. 
     
    For unsignalized intersections, the analysis assumes that traffic on the mainline is not affected by traffic on the 
    side streets. The LOS is determined primarily for left turns from the main street and all movements from the 
    minor street (site driveways in this case). The study of an unsignalized intersection is, for the most part, done by 
    observing the most critical movement, which is most often the left turn out of the side street. The evaluation 
    criteria used to analyze intersections is based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)1 and are included in 
    the Attachments. 
     
    Unsignalized Site Driveway Capacity Analyses 
     
    Table 4 presents a summary of the capacity analyses for the unsignalized site driveways along Wells Avenue. The 
    capacity analyses worksheets are included in the Attachments.

            As outlined in Table 4, the traffic operations at both access driveways currently operate at LOS C or better 
            during the critical afternoon peak period.  With the proposed site access circulation and dropoff/pickup 
            protocols in place, and the associated redistribution of traffic that will create, operations of both site driveways 
            has been maintained at LOS C or better  and This represents good operations for site driveway movements 
            during the critical period of site traffic activity. 
             
            Conclusion 
            This memo has been prepared to provide a review of existing and future traffic conditions at the Russian School 
            of Mathematics (RSM) and Dance Fever site with the proposed site modifications and operational protocols in 
            place.  Currently the school portion of the facility is permitted for up to 10 students per class room and current 
            enrollment is beyond the permitted levels. Given the popularity of the school the applicant is seeking 
            modification to its special permit to allow: 
             
            ·        up to 200 students in the school at any given time 
            ·        up to a maximum of 15 students per class 
            ·        up to 17 classes to occur at any one time 
            ·        up to 28 employees on site at any one time 
             
            To improve on existing facilities and operations, the Proponent is proposing modifications to the existing site 
            plan and the introduction of a traffic/parking management plan that includes protocols for student dropoff and 
            pickup.  Review of accidents records in at the two site access driveways indicates that there are limited at the 
            Lot B driveway (2 accidents in 5 years) and no recorded accidents at the Lot A driveway. The calculated accident 
            rate at the western driveway falls well below the MassDOT average accident rate for unsignalized intersections. 
            Review of available sight distance indicates that the with the proposed access modifications adequate stopping 
            sight distance is available at both driveways with the exception of the eastbound approach to the east driveway.  
            To improve sight distance at this location to meet the minimum required, clearing of existing vegetation is 
            strongly recommended as discussed above and outlined in the figure contained in the appendix.  In addition, 
            additional clearing to improve on ISD, moving the STOP signs/stop bar forward (24 feet) behind sidewalk, and 
            relocating the existing panel sign on the east side of the Lot A driveway (by a few feet further into the site) will 
            all contribute to improving the overall sight lines for each driveway.  Operations of the site driveways during

Re:        200 Wells Avenue / Russian School of Mathematics and Dance Fever

Date:      June 25, 2013

On behalf of the petitioners for this land use petition I am submitting this report regarding the availability of parking for
the amendment to Special Permit Board Order #325-06.

Background and Proposal Highlights

The Russian School of Mathematics ("RSM") and Dance Fever sought and received approval from the Board of Aldermen
in 2006 to operate a for-profit after school and weekend program. In the interim, the programs have seen increases in
the number of enrolled students and faculty. Accordingly, RSM has filed a request to amend the 2006 special permit in a
number of ways. Specifically, RSM is seeking to:

      A.   Allow up to 200 students in the school at any given time
      B.   Allow up to a maximum of 15 students per class
      C.   Allow up to 17 classes to occur at any one time
      D.   Allow up to 28 employees on site at any one time

The focus of this report was to determine whether the current and proposed parking supply will adequately meet the
circulation and parking needs of the site going forward. 1 Since the majority of the students at RSM are dropped off at
the beginning of their class and picked up at the conclusion of the class, the best way to accommodate the increased
enrollment is to improve the efficiency of the circulation at the site, as opposed to increasing available parking. In fact,
the parking counts revealed that even at peak drop-off and pick-up times, there were between 28 and 42 onsite parking
spaces available. (see Chart III)

A most significant feature of the proposed improvement to the site operation includes a proposed circular driveway in
front of the school that would connect through both parking lots. This driveway will facilitate both drop-off and pickup
of students and will considerably ease the parking demands on the existing two lots. The specifics of the operation of
the new driveway including queuing distances, parking duration, access and egress from the site will be considered in an
accompanying report prepared by VHB Associates.

This report concludes that the proposed driveway will significantly improve the drop-off and pick-up process at the site.
The connecting driveway will allow approximately 15 cars to queue as the drivers efficiently drop off their children at the
start of class, leaving the 63 onsite parking spaces available for teachers and parents who are picking up their children. A
conservative estimate is that the proposed driveway will eliminate 75% of the parking associated with drop-off, and 40%
of the parking associated with pick-up




1
 Based on the recent zoning review by the Department of Inspectional Services, RSM and Dance Fever combined require a total of
56 parking stalls. Since a total of 63 parking stalls are provided on site, a parking waiver is not required in this application.
Operations Existing Conditions

Both RSM and Dance Fever would continue to operate in the 15,305 square foot space in a former office building at 200
Wells Avenue. Weekly classes and instruction for both activities primarily occur between 3:00pm and 9:00pm on
weekdays and between 8:00am and 7:00pm on weekends. Most of the existing programs are geared towards the
school-age population with Dance Fever offering some later evening classes for adults. The vast majority of students in
both schools are driven by car to the school, dropped off and picked up when the sessions are over. Carpooling is
encouraged and frequently more than one child per household is enrolled in concurrent classes.

As of Spring 2013, here are the daily numbers of classes and students enrolled at both RSM and Dance Fever:




In terms of peak capacities, the critical periods are weekdays between 5:00pm and 6:00pm when as many as 17 RSM
classes are in operation simultaneously. Start and end times for the 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 hour classes are roughly staggered
to 15-minute intervals during the peak times. On Saturdays, peak start and end times are between 11:00am and 12:00
noon, and later between 3:15 and 3:45pm. The Sunday peak period is between 11:00 and 11:45am.

Peak periods for Dance Fever classes tend to be a bit later than RSM with the largest enrollments occurring between
6:00 and 8:00pm. During those times typically 25 students are attending classes. On Saturdays, the period between
10:00am and 12:00 noon is busiest with 20 students attending classes. Sunday classes are particularly light with just 10
students at most taking classes between 12:00 noon and 1:00pm. There are fewer students per teacher at Dance Fever
                                                            2
and the ratio is close to 3 students per teacher for these sessions. The owner of Dance Fever estimates that there are no
more than 10 students who drive themselves to class each week; most students are provided with rides.

Parking Facilities

Under the current operation, three designated parking areas are used for both RSM and Dance Fever as follows:

    1. Parking lot "A": This is the largest parking area and is located adjacent to the main entrance to the building. The
       lot accommodates a total of 49 parking spaces, including 1 handicap space in close proximity to the main
       entrance. The lot is accessed from Wells Avenue and there is sufficient aisle width to accommodate a two-way
       flow in the lot. At present the lot is used exclusively for student pick up and there is a 15-minute maximum time
       limit for parking.
    2. Parking lot "B": This lot has been recently reopened and is located further west on Wells Avenue, about 50 yards
       from the entrance to Parking Lot A. The lot accommodates 14 parking spaces, none are handicap spaces. At this
       time, the lot is designated for student drop off only and there is a 5-minute parking limitation.
    3. Auxiliary parking lot: The petitioners have established a leased parking arrangement with the owners of the
       adjacent office building at 180 Wells Avenue. In total, 24 consecutive parking spaces (none handicap) at the
       closest point to the RSM site are available for administration and faculty use. These spaces are accessed from a
       separate driveway off of Wells Avenue to the 180 Wells Avenue site. There is a walkway connecting this parking
       area with the RSM site.

In the three lots described, there are a total of 87 available parking spaces. The actual zoning requirement for RSM and
Dance Fever is 56 parking spaces, leaving a surplus of 31 spaces. If the on-site allocation of 63 spaces (14 in lot B and 49
in lot A) is considered, then a surplus of 7 parking spaces is present.

Open parking on one side of Wells Avenue (the side opposite the site) is permitted by the City and there are
approximately 24 spaces from the entrance of Parking lot B to just beyond the entrance to parking lot A. However, the
petitioners continue to urge parents, faculty, and administration to avoid using Wells Avenue for drop off, pickup, or
general parking purposes.

RSM has taken the additional positive step of hiring its own parking manager and one Newton police detail during the
busiest weeknight hours. This effort has greatly assisted the vehicular flow in and out of both parking lots A and B. In
addition, pedestrian safety for students has improved as there is supervision of students entering and exiting parked
cars.

Parking Methodology and Results

To get a complete picture of the parking supply and demand for both uses, it is necessary to understand the current and
proposed operations and match them with the peak periods. With access to all of the classroom enrollments, schedules,
and observations, it was determined that the peak periods for parking are generally between 5:00pm and 6:00pm on
weekdays and in later morning and early afternoon on Saturdays and Sundays. As noted earlier, Mondays are the peak
operation day with Tuesdays and Wednesdays not far behind. Planning Horizons surveyed the three main parking
locations (lot A, lot B, Auxiliary lot) and also surveyed the parking used along Wells Avenue at the peak times.

In total all four locations were surveyed on 18 different occasions. Each weekday was surveyed on two or more
occasions, and in addition there were three Saturday and one Sunday surveys conducted.

Since RSM classes are staggered to start and end in 15-minute intervals, it was decided to conduct three different
parking counts 10 minutes apart for an interval totaling 20 minutes. This method allowed for fluctuation in drop-offs and
                                                              3
pickups that typically occur within a several-minute window around the start and end of classes. For the summary of
counts contained in the body of this report, the average of three separate intervals was used. The full detail of the
capacities at each of the intervals is included in Appendix A of this report.

Four baseline counts were taken at the start of classes at approximately 3:30pm on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
afternoons. These counts were taken to assess the capacities at the start of the RSM sessions and an hour and a half
after Dance Fever classes had commenced. These counts will be considered separately from the 5:00-6:00pm peak
weekday hour counts.

All counts were conducted between March 28 and April 25, 2013. Weather conditions were noted but generally
temperatures were a little above average and conditions ranged from clear to a light rain falling. This time of year
corresponds to expected highest enrollment numbers for the entire academic year.

All of the data obtained can be best summarized in chart form using the day of the week as the frame of reference as
follows:

*These columns include all of the cars parked on Wells Avenue at the time of the count. Parking on Wells Avenue is open and
available to all members of the public. Therefore, some of the vehicles included in this count may well be attributable to non-
RSM/Dance Fever uses. The proposed connector driveway will eliminate any need for patrons of the site to park on Wells Avenue, to
the extent that such a need currently exists.

In terms of peak hour counts the lowest count on an individual day was Thursday March 28 with an average of 56 cars
parked during the interval in all locations. The highest recorded count occurred on Wednesday April 24 when 90 cars
were parked during the 5:20-5:40pm period. The range of all counts on all weekdays is between 65 cars parked on
Tuesdays and 82 cars parked on Wednesdays.




                                                                    4
The following chart denotes the number and percent of available parking spaces in Lot A, Lot B, and the Auxiliary parking
area by day of the week:




Under current conditions, there are on average between 28 and 42 parking spaces available at any given time. In total,
the three parking areas provide 87 spaces.

To summarize, Charts I-III demonstrate the following points:

    ·   During the busiest periods, RSM and Dance Fever combined generate an average actual parking demand of
        between 57 and 82 spaces depending on the day of the week.
    ·   There are between 28 and 42 available parking spaces during the peak periods in Lot A, Lot B, and the Auxiliary
        parking area.
    ·   The highest recorded amount of parking occurred on April 24 when 90 cars were observed.
    ·   The recent deployment of a police detail, employing a park lot attendant, and reopening lot B have considerably
        improved conditions and safety on site. Going forward, the proposed site driveway will improve conditions
        further and this will be discussed in the next section.

Future Conditions and Limitations, Site Driveway Parking Projections and Drop-Off and Pickup Plan

The current petition seeks to establish the following limits on the overall use:

    ·   No more than 200 children in the school at any time
    ·   No more than 15 students per class
    ·   No more than 17 classes conducted at any one time
    ·   No more than 28 employees on site at any one time

Each of these limitations falls within the boundaries of how RSM and Dance Fever are currently operating in the Spring
of 2013. Therefore, the parking analysis based on current conditions will closely reflect future expectations and demand
for parking with the main exception of the new site driveway.

This land use petition contains the provision to construct a one-way site driveway directly in front of the building that
will be accessed from lot B and will exit onto lot A in close proximity to Wells Avenue. This is a major improvement to
the site operation and will considerably reduce parking demand as described later on in this report.

A second issue relates to the status of the auxiliary lot in the long term. The lot accommodates 24 cars and has been a
great benefit for teachers and administrators needing long-term parking. However, a long-term lease arrangement may
not be achievable and RSM and Dance Fever will need to provide adequate onsite parking. Under future conditions, the
assumption will be made that these 24 spaces will not be available.

                                                              5
Parking Projections

The proposed site driveway will considerably reduce the need for onsite parking. In particular, the drop-off of students
will be greatly facilitated as drivers will access the site driveway, drop off and leave the site without having to park in
either lot A or lot B. The pickup of students creates a potentially greater parking demand as parents may arrive 5-10
minutes early and will not be able to remain in the driveway for "live" parking. However, many parents will arrive on
time or perhaps be late and students will be waiting to greet them in the site drive.

The following parking projections (see Chart IV below) are based on the following assumptions:

       ·    The new site drive will eliminate 75% of the cars that currently use a parking space for drop-off purposes
       ·    The new site drive will eliminate 40% of pick up parking that currently occurs
       ·    All employees (up to 28 at one time) will need long-term parking and there will be one parked car per employee
       ·    The amount of total onsite parking (between 57 and 82 cars) depending on the day will continue and remain
            constant
       ·    The Auxiliary parking area of 24 spaces will no longer be available and a total of 62 onsite spaces will be
            available for both schools

When all of these factors are introduced, the following chart clearly demonstrates that adequate onsite parking will be
available:

It is estimated that there will be at least 9 available spaces in either parking lot A or B at the peak hour.

Parking Drop-Off, and Pickup Plan

A revised parking drop-off and pickup plan needs to include the following elements:

       ·    Students will be dropped off and picked up in the new site driveway between lot A and lot B. The driveway will
            allow for live parking and those needing parking beyond a minute or two will be directed to parking lot A.
       ·    Teacher and administrator parking will occur in lot B and in lot A closest to Wells Avenue
       ·    A parking attendant will monitor the site driveway between 3:00 and 7:00pm on weekdays to insure student
            pedestrian safety and to keep traffic circulating through the driveway
       ·    Regular reminders will be sent to parents regarding parking procedures and to reinforce the concept that there
            will be no parking on Wells Avenue 2

  Although not directly related, RSM ought to consider further staggering of classes to allow for a more even distribution of class
start and ending times. For example, currently 10 RSM classes start on Monday at 3:30pm and only 3 start at 3:45pm (see Appendix
B). Starting either 6 or 7 classes at both times would reduce parking demands at pickup times.
                                                                         6
    ·   Both RSM and Dance Fever will further develop and promote a carpool program that will further reduce
        vehicular trips. Reduced tuition rates and other incentives will be offered to parents who continually
        demonstrate viable carpooling arrangements.
    ·   Lease arrangements (whether temporary or long term) will be sought to allow for teacher and administrator
        parking

In conclusion, the new site driveway will greatly offset parking demands and there is sufficient parking to accommodate
the current and future needs of both schools. This, coupled with an active and closely monitored parking drop-off and
pickup plan described at the end of this report will allow the schools to operate in a safe and efficient manner.

The Wells Avenue Parking area is open to all public use in the area; some of the observed vehicles may be attributable to
non-RSM/Dance Fever uses.

RE:    Request to amend the conditions of the 2006 Site Plan Approval/Special Permit Board Order
       #325-06 , to install a circular driveway connecting two parking lots, and to install a shed and
       play area onsite



                                                     SBL: 84 034A 0002




BACKGROUND:
The property at 200 Wells Avenue consists of a 87,120 square foot lot improved with a structure built
in 1979. The applicant has run an afterschool and weekend mathematics program on the premises
since 2006, when the Board of Aldermen issued Board Order #325-06, granting a special permit and
site plan approval for the for-profit educational use. The Board Order waived requirements of the
parking provisions, and approved the installation of two free-standing signs. The Board Order was also
specific as to limitations on the applicant's operation at the site with respect to class size, maximum
number of students and employees allowed onsite at any given time, and when and how frequently
classes could start. A parking and drop-off plan was also approved, calling for parents to use one of the
two onsite parking lots (known as "Lot B") exclusively for drop-off. A concurrent Board Order (#324-
06) was issued for Dance Fever (a dance program for children and adults located at the premises) with
similar conditions. In 2006, both the applicant and Dance Fever were located on the first floor of 200
Wells Avenue, and the second floor of the building was used as commercial office space.




                            Preserving the Past      Planning for the Future
Over the past seven years, the applicant's program has grown to its current enrollment of
approximately 200 children. The office use in the building has shrunk from 16,516 square feet to 1,211
square feet, with the remaining 15,305 now occupied by the math school.

The previous Board Order contained several conditions for the operation of the school. This
application proposes to amend the following conditions:
   · No more than ten students per class
   · No more than ten employees on site at any time
   · No more than one weekday class is scheduled to begin concurrently, between 3:30 pm and 6:00
       pm, and there is no less than 15 minutes between the scheduled start time of such classes
   · The maximum number of students on-site, at any given time, cannot exceed 100 students, of
       which no more than 14% of the total students may be over 14 years of age.
   · Parents and guardians park within a delineated parking stall to drop off or pick up students
   · Drop-off and pick-up activities occur only on-site, within delineated parking stalls, and no such
       activities take place within maneuvering aisles, driveways, or designated "No Parking" areas on
       site and may not occur on Well Avenue
   · Vehicles are permitted to park for a maximum of 15 minutes within Lot B, and that Lot B is
       limited for use by parents and guardians of the mathematics school students only, for the pick-
       up and drop-off of such students
   · Freestanding sign details, consisting of two sheets:
           o Free standing directory, dated 11/30/2006
           o Free standing directory, dated 10/9/2006
   · Parking lot and pedestrian lighting plans and details, consisting of 3 sheets:
           o "Existing Site Lighting Calc"
           o "Partial Plan Showing Proposed Bollard Lighting"

In January 2013, the Inspectional Services Department cited the applicant for violations of the Board
Order, as follows:
    · Parents were not using Lot B for drop-off and pick-up (Lot B had been closed)
    · Parents were parking on Wells Avenue for drop-off and pick-up
    · There were at times more than 10 students per class
    · There were at times more than 100 students on site
    · A shed had been constructed illegally on site
    · The school was not conducting annual inspections, as required by the State Building Code

To accommodate the current intensity of the use on the site, the applicant proposes to amend the
current site plan to include a circular driveway attaching Lot B and Lot A. The driveway will allow for
curbside drop-off of students, and will eliminate the need for parents to park and walk their children
into the building. Parents may still park in Lot A when they are picking up the children. The applicant
is also proposing to construct a new fenced-in play area and storage shed onsite, and seeks to legalize
an existing storage shed.

ADMINISTRATIVE DETERMINATIONS:
1. The School obtained a special permit (Board Order #325-06) in 2006 to operate a for-profit after-
   school/weekend math program with no more than 100 students in the building at a time. As the
   enrollment has increased significantly, the School needs to amend the special permit to allow the
   current enrollment and enrollment capacity. The applicant seeks to allow up to 200 children in the
   school at any given time.

2. The Board Order limits the class size to ten students per class. Due to current enrollment, the
   applicant seeks to increase the class size limit to 15 students.

3. The Board Order currently limits the number of classes to ten at a time. Due to current enrollment,
   the applicant seeks to increase the number of classes to up to 17 at a time.

4. The Board Order currently limits the number of employees on site at any given time to no more
   than ten. The applicant seeks to amend the Board Order to allow up to 28 employees on site at a
   time.

5. The Board Order currently requires that all students be dropped off in Lot B, and permits parking
   for no more than 15 minutes. The applicant seeks to amend the Board Order to allow a revised
   parking, drop-off and pick-up plan which will include Lot B as well as a new proposed driveway
   connecting Lots A and B, with pick-up to continue to occur in Lot A only.

6. A revised lighting plan must be approved to include lighting along the proposed driveway
   connection Lots A and B.

7. A revised directional and signage package must be approved to address the change in traffic flow.
   The directional signs must be in compliance with the dimensional standards set forth in the Newton
   Zoning Ordinance section 30-20(f)(8).

8. The Russian School and Dance Fever require a combined total of 56 parking stalls. There are
   currently 62 stalls on site. Therefore, no parking waiver is required.
9. The deed restriction for the site requires site plan approval for changes made to the property. The
   applicant seeks approval to construct a fenced-in play area and shed on-site, as well as to legalize
   an existing storage shed.

In reference to the above site, I have the following comments for a plan entitled:


                                 Topographic Site Plan
                                      Newton, MA
                    Showing Proposed Conditions at #200 Wells Avenue

                                Dated: March 25, 2013


Executive Summary:

The plan submitted shows a proposed playground along Wells Avenue, the playground
will be placed over existing water services and sanitary sewer connections. Without
having any details of the playground, I urge caution if footings are to be used for any
playground equipment or structures so that the installation of any footings do not damage
these services. Not knowing what the proposed playground surface is, which may trigger

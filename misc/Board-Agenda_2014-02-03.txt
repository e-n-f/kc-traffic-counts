Ordinance  to  address  Blood  Plasma  Centers.      
  
December  16,  2013  
The  Township  Board  passed  a  resolution  sponsoring  proposed  Blood  Plasma  Center  amendments  and  
transmitting  the  amendments  to  the  Planning  Commission  for  a  public  hearing.  
  
January  7,  2014  
Township  attorney  Gordon  Van  Wieren  provided  a  written  opinion  regarding  the  proposed  Blood  
Plasma  Center  amendments.  
  
January  13,  2014  
The  Planning  Commission  held  a  public  hearing  regarding  the  proposed  Blood  Plasma  Center  
amendments.      There  were  no  public  comments.    The  Commission  unanimously  recommended  approval

which  primarily  whole  blood  is  extracted  from  donors  and  used,  transferred  or  sold,  such  as  blood  
donation  centers  sponsored  by  the  American  Red  Cross.

VIII.   PUBLIC COMMENTS FOR ITEMS NOT ON AGENDA (maximum two minutes)
             Roger Weathers who lives at 4821 Grand Woods Drive, Lansing, MI. Mr.
             Weathers states that he has lived there 13 years and has noticed that when there
             is snow, that removal is sometimes as long as a week. He further stated that the
             last snowfall of over a foot, there were at least 9 cars stuck in the middle of the
             road and was not removed timely despite multiple calls. Mr. Weather stated that
             he visited the Building Department, who was kind enough to make a call for him
             regarding the snow.

              Mr. Weathers states that during the ice storm, he did not witness any police
              through that Sunday evening coming to check on residents. Those residents in
              that neighborhood were essentially trapped due to downed power lines. Mr.
              Weathers states that the Fire Department came through that Monday morning for
              a downed power line. Mr. Weathers believes that the police and/or the National
              Guard should have been called out. Mr. Weathers stated that he doesn't believe
              there were warning centers. Supervisor Fletcher stated that Mt. Hope Church
              was open in addition to the Lansing Mall.

              Supervisor Fletcher thanked Mr. Weather for coming. Supervisor Fletcher stated
              that the Eaton County Road Commission does not have the resources to remove
              snow during a huge snowfall on a timely basis. That Wellness checks should
              have begun happening sooner than they did. That these issues and others have
              been discussed and will be addressed toward the end of tonight's meeting.

                    STREETS, SIDEWALKS AND PUBLIC PLACES
                           Article V.  Complete Streets


SECTION 34 ­ 100. DEFINITIONS.

       The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this Ordinance, shall have
the meaning ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a
different meaning:

        Complete Streets Infrastructure means roadways and/or public rights-of-way
planned, designed, and constructed to provide appropriate access to all legal users in a
manner that promotes safe and efficient movement of people and goods whether by car,
truck, transit, assistive device, foot, or bicycle.

        Street Project means the construction, reconstruction, retrofit, or alteration, and
includes the planning, design, approval, and implementation processes, except that
"Street Project" does not include maintenance such as cleaning, sweeping, mowing, spot
repair, or interim measures on detour routes.

       Users means legal users of the roadways and public right-of-way, including
pedestrians, bicyclists, motor vehicle drivers, public transportation riders and drivers, and
people of all ages and abilities including children, youth, families, older adults, and
individuals with disabilities.

SECTION 34 ­ 101. PURPOSES.

       The purposes of this ordinance are as follows:

       1. To promote public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare
          of the community by providing opportunities for walking, bicycling, personal
          vehicular transportation and public transportation.

       2. To encourage increased use of non-motorized modes of transportation.

       3. To attempt to maximize access for all segments of the population including
          both persons with and without disabilities.

SECTION 34­102. COMPLETE STREET INFRASTRUCTURE.

   1. The Township shall endeavor to make complete streets practices a routine part of
      operations, strive to make every street project accessible for all users, and
      coordinate efforts with other agencies and jurisdictions to achieve complete
TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2014 TOWNSHIP BOARD MINUTES ­ REGULAR MEETING
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA
Page 4 of 20


     streets. The Township shall work in partnership with the Eaton County Road
     Commission and Michigan Department of Transportation to facilitate
     implementation of Complete Streets to the extent feasible, pursuant to this
     Ordinance.

  2. To the extent possible, the Township resolves to consider complete streets
     practices for every street project in order to provide reasonably safe travel along
     and across the road right-of-way for each category of users; provided, however,
     that such infrastructure may be excluded, upon agreement of the Township Board
     and the applicable public road agency, subject to each agency's powers and
     duties, where documentation and data indicate that:

     a. Use by non-motorized users is prohibited by law.

     b. The cost would be excessively disproportionate to the need or probable future
        use over the long term, or funding is simply not available.

     c. There is an absence of current or future need.

     d. Inclusion of complete streets infrastructure would be unreasonable or
        inappropriate in light of the scope of the project.

     e. Implementation of complete streets infrastructure is not possible due to physical
        restraints imposed by the project area.

  3. As feasible pursuant to sub-section 34-102 (2), the Township will consider
     incorporating complete streets infrastructure into existing streets to improve the
     safety and convenience of users, construct and enhance the transportation
     network for each category of users, and create a walkable community.

  4. As feasible pursuant to sub-section 34-102 (2), if the safety and convenience of
     users can be improved within the scope of a street project that includes pavement
     resurfacing, restriping, or signalization operations, the Township Board will review
     the possibility of incorporating complete streets improvements.

  5. The Township will review all appropriate plans, zoning and subdivision codes,
     laws, procedures, and rules, including the Comprehensive Plan, Non-Motorized
     Transportation Plan, and Sidewalk Plan of the Township to attempt to address the
     needs of all users in all street projects on public and private streets. This shall be
     done through the normal course of revisions and updates to these documents.

SECTION 34 ­ 103. DATA COLLECTION, STANDARDS, AND PUBLIC INPUT.

CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA
Page 5 of 20


      1. The Township has collected a significant amount of data and obtained public input
         by various means pertaining to multiple modes of transportation which is reflected
         in the Township's Comprehensive Plan, Non-Motorized Transportation Plan,
         Sidewalk Plan, and Parks & Recreation Plan. Like any planning document, these
         plans may be amended and/or updated from time to time.

      2. The Township shall continue to encourage public participation in decisions
         concerning the design and use of streets.

      3. The Township shall work in concert with the Eaton County Road Commission and
         Michigan Department of Transportation when evaluating future roadway projects
         for the inclusion or feasibility of complete streets infrastructure.

      4. All street projects requiring funding and/or approval by the Township Board shall
         attempt to:

         a. Evaluate the effect of the proposed project on safe travel by all users.

         b. Identify measures to mitigate any adverse impacts on such travel that are
            identified.

XII.   ITEMS REMOVED FROM CONSENT AGENDA FOR DISCUSSION

            Merrill, Barbara Stump, Peter Spadafore, John Boles, and Richard Brown to
            the Complaint Review Committee.

            Trustee Fedewa asked whether all of the above applicants were volunteers
            or if there was any outreach. Supervisor Fletcher stated some applied and
            some he reached out to. Trustee Fedewa asked which applicants applied
            and which were reached out to. Supervisor Fletcher stated the following
            applied: Karen Stump, Karen Holcom-Merrill, Peter Spadafore and Richard
            Brown. Supervisor Fletcher stated he reached out to John Boles.

            Trustee Fedewa suggested that the term of the appointment be included on
            the application.

            CLERK CLARK MOVED TO APPROVE THE FIVE RECOMMENDED
            COMPLAINT REVIEW COMMITTEE APPOINTMENTS.

            TREASURER PIZZO SUPPORTED THE MOTION.

            THE MOTION PASSED 6-0 (TRUSTEE HICKS ABSENT).

       5.   Approval of Delta Township District Library bylaws ­
            The Township Supervisor recommends that the Township Board approve
            the amended Delta Township District Library Bylaws.

            Supervisor Fletcher requested that this item be tabled due to some
            typographical errors until the next Regular Board Meeting.

            Treasurer Pizzo asked whether when this comes up for adoption, if there
            will be an accompanying reason for the Bylaw change. Supervisor Fletcher
            stated that yes a cover memorandum would be included explaining the
            reasons for the changes, though they are relatively minor.

       6.   Establishment of Street Lighting District for Shadow Glen Phase No. 2
            and Shadow Glen No. 3 and Name Correction for Street Lighting
            District #126.

            establishment of a Street Lighting District for Shadow glen Phases 2 & 3
TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2014 TOWNSHIP BOARD MINUTES ­ REGULAR MEETING
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA
Page 8 of 20


          and approve a name correction for Street Lighting District #126.

          Trustee Fedewa stated there was no history included in the packet for this
          request and asked the current status as well as the history preceding since this is
          a permanent tax assessment.             Trustee Fedewa asked how many
          residents/properties would be affected. Trustee Fedewa stated that he believes
          when a request is made for a permanent property tax assessment is made that
          full documentation should be available before the request is acted on.

          Clerk Clark asked whether Trustee Fedewa was looking for the document signed
          by E.T. MacKenzie the owner. Trustee Fedewa stated that that document along
          with a map of the area involved, how many current residents would be affected or
          whether they are vacant lots.

          Clerk Clark stated that the files are available and asked whether Assistant
          Planning Director Gary Bozek could answer Trustee Fedewa's question.

          Assistant Planning Director Bozek stated that it is typical when a developer is
          developing a subdivision; they create a street lighting district for the vacant lots,
          which is the case for this development. Once residents move in they are
          assessed.

          Trustee Fedewa asked whether this development has been platted yet. Assistant
          Planning Director Bozek stated that they have just been approved in November
          2013 by the Township Board.

          Treasurer Pizzo asked if Shadow Glen No. 1 is the same way, Assistant Planning
          Director Bozek confirmed, further stating that all subdivisions when developed,
          the street lighting districts are submitted by the developer. Treasurer Pizzo
          stated that the street lighting district was decided after the subdivision was built.
          Assistant Planning Director stated since July 2011, subdivisions before being
          developed have the street lighting districts planned.

          Treasurer Pizzo asked whether the property owner then is assessed after
          building on the property, Assistant Planner Gary Bozek stated yes.

          Trustee Fedewa stated that since all properties aren't built or inhabited
          concurrently, asked what the trigger was for the developer to install the street
          lighting district. Assistant Planner stated that the street lights are put in at the
          same time as all other utilities and when the street lights are energized and there
          are lots that aren't owned, the developer pays the assessment. Clerk Clark
          stated that is why the memo references the contract proposal from Consumers
          Energy as well as the motion authorizes the Clerk to sign the contract. Assistant
          Planner Gary Bozek stated that the developer files an application for final
TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2014 TOWNSHIP BOARD MINUTES ­ REGULAR MEETING
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA
Page 9 of 20


             preliminary plat, which is the point at which all the engineering is provided and all
             of the infrastructure is put in at that time. Trustee Fedewa asked when the lights
             are turned on, Assistant Planning Director Bozek stated the developer will
             request them to be energized when the plat is complete. Clerk Clark stated the
             action has to be voted on first, then the contract has to be signed and states the
             contracts have been in her possession since the last Regular Board Meeting in
             December 2013 and tonight's meeting is the first opportunity to take action since
             the last Regular Board meeting was canceled. Clerk Clark stated that the
             developer is ready and waiting for the Board's action.

             Trustee Fedewa stated his concern was that the residents already there, if any,
             would bear the brunt of the cost rather than the developer absorbing the cost for
             the unoccupied plats. Assistant Planning Director Bozek confirmed that the costs
             associated are prorated across the plats with the developer paying the costs
             associated with undeveloped parcels.

        7.   Introduction of Proposed Resolution to Continue the Greater Lansing
             Regional Chamber (GLRC) Membership for Storm water Management.
             The Community Development Department recommends that the Township Board
             consider a proposed resolution to continue membership in the GLRC for Storm
             water Management.

          Assistant Planning Director Bozek stated that the Community Development
          Department is asking for adoption of the resolution, not the introduction. The
          GLRC is made up of 18 different municipalities, county agencies, school districts
          and 2 other associate members. It is a consortium of local governmental
          agencies that participate in the Phase II storm water activities. Assistant
          Planning Director Bozek states in order to meet the Federal guidelines for
          National pollution elimination discharge system permit, there is a huge public
          education component, and GLRC, by combining efforts is able to meet this
          requirement. There is an annual fee of about $6,600, Tri-County is the staffing
          organization for the committee, by virtue of their combined efforts, we are able to
          comply with requirements for the permit. The original agreement term was 3
          years and expired April 2013. All of the previous members are being asked to
          adopt resolutions to rejoin the group with a commitment for another 3 year period
          (until April 2017). The resolution appoints Assistant Planning Director Gary
          Bozek, as the Delta Township representative on the committee.

     8.   Introduction of Louis J. Eyde Family, LLC Rezoning Request
          The Community Development Department recommends that the Township Board
          introduces the Louis J. Eye Family, LLC request to rezone their property
          described in Case No. 10-13-18.

          Planner Chris Gruba states that this is an introduction. The Planning
          Commission is recommending introduction of Figure 5, which is the
          business and commercial north of the retention pond, south of the retention
          pond there would be a reduction in residential density. The Planning
          Commission moved to recommend approval of the ¼ RE, ¾ RD option as
          presented by staff.

          Supervisor Fletcher asked if this reiteration of the original plan was a
          compromise that both the residents and developer are happy with. Planner
          Gruba stated it is.

          Trustee Fedewa asked if the public would have access to all 5 different
          proposals. Planner Gruba stated yes, that at the next Regular Board
TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2014 TOWNSHIP BOARD MINUTES ­ REGULAR MEETING
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA
Page 12 of 20


          Meeting the original proposal is what would be approved or denied and if
          denied which of the other 4 proposals would the Board like to pursue.

          Clerk Clark confirmed that figure 5 maintains St. Joe Hwy as is. Planner
          Gruba confirmed.

          Trustee Kosinski confirmed that the RE and RD sections would give the
          developer by right to construct duplexes apartments, however mobile
          homes would require SLUP. Trustee Kosinski notes concerns regarding
          traffic density, whether the residences are largely oriented toward families
          with children due to safety.

          Treasurer Pizzo asked whether a revised proposal would be provided for
          consideration that would include backup information. Planner Gruba stated that
          he intends to include the Planning Commission minutes outlining each option for
          the next Regular Board Meeting.

          Supervisor Fletcher asked if there were any members of the public who wished to
          speak. Greg Leap who lives at 8306 W, St. Joseph stated that he is not in favor
          of this proposal and would like to see a more comprehensive traffic study
          including flow onto St. Joe as well as Saginaw Hwy and believes it should be
          asked for before the property is rezoned.

          TRUSTEE KOSINSKI MOVED THAT THE DELTA TOWNSHIP BOARD
          INTRODUCE THE LOUIS J. EYDE FAMILY, LLC REQUEST AS
          DESCRIBED IN CASE NO. 10-13-18 TO REZONE 21.76 ACRES FROM
          RC, MODERATE DENSITY RESIDENTIAL TO B2, COMMUNITY
          COMMERCIAL AND 41.70 ACRES FROM RB, LOW DENSITY
          RESIDENTIAL AND RC, MODERATE DENSITY RESIDENTIAL TO RE,
          HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL AS ILLUSTRATED ON THE ATTACHED
          FIGURE 1.

          I FURTHER MOVE THAT THE REZONING REQUEST SHALL BE
          CONSIDERED FOR FINAL ACTION BY THE TOWNSHIP BOARD AT THE
          FEBRUARY 3, 2014 REGULAR MEETING. THE CLERK IS HEREBY
          DIRECTED TO PUBLISH NOTICE OF SAID MEETING IN THE LOCAL
          NEWSPAPERS AS IS REQUIRED.

      9.      Recommendation for Acceptance of Bid for Skyway Lane Pump Station
              Package
              The Township Engineer recommends that the Township Board accept the
              proposal from DuBois Cooper for furnishing and delivering the submersible pump
              package for the Skyway Lane Pump Station in the amount of $26,228.00.

              TRUSTEE FEDEWA MOVED THAT DELTA CHARTER TOWNSHIP
              ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL FROM DUBOIS COOPER FOR FURNISHING
              AND DELIVERING THE SUBMERSIBLE PUMP PACKAGE FOR THE
              SKYWAY LANE PUMP STATION, AS OUTLINED IN THEIR PROPOSAL
              DATED JANUARY 9, 2014, IN THE AMOUNT OF $26,228.00.

              I FURTHER MOVE THAT THE TOWNSHIP MANAGER BE AUTHORIZED
              AND DIRECTED TO SIGN THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS RELATED
              TO THE PURCHASE OF THE SUBMERSIBLE PUMP PACKAGE.

              Trustee Fedewa asked how many pumps are in the Township Engineer
              Gary Arnold stated between 12-16 pumps. Trustee Fedewa asked whether
              this pump was being replaced because of life expectancy. Township
              Engineer Arnold stated this pump is on Old Lansing Road and has been in
              use since the mid 70's. It is steel can station in the ground and is beginning
              to fail.

              Treasurer Pizzo asked if the Gorman Rupp pumps were a new pump.
              Township Engineer Arnold stated they have been around for years and
              Delta Township has them installed in many locations. He also stated that
              prior to 18 months ago, Gunfos was manufacturing pumps that Gorman
              Rupp put their name on they are now separated and Gorman Rupp now
              makes that pump. Township Engineer Arnold further explained that the
              reason for not going with the 2nd low bidder has to do with the spin rate on
              the pump ­ which when higher, decreases the life of the pump. The DuBois
              pump spins at half the rate of the 2nd low bidder.

                constructed this year.
                On January 23, 2014, the Planning Department will be holding a meeting on
                Arden Road sidewalks at 7:00 p.m. These sidewalks connect our trail to
                Robbins Road.
                Currently all areas are being reviewed in relation to the Storm Response. Fire
                Chief John Clark will be giving an overview of the emergency response.
                However, all other responses to the recent ice and ice storm are being reviewed
                for improvements. Manager Watkins stated that the ECRC, although struggling
                with funding, was extremely helpful and cooperative in disseminating information
                to keep the public informed. Also of note, East Lansing came in for a day to
                assist with the plowing efforts in Delta Township.
                On February 10, 2014, the Eaton County Sheriff's Department will be presenting
                a Neighborhood Watch program. The Township will be getting details out shorty.

       Treasurer Pizzo asked if there is a map of all of the sidewalks included In the Safe
       Routes to school. Manager Watkins stated one can be obtained from the ECRC.

       Trustee Fedewa asked whether the Township would be billed for the work East Lansing
       did on the roads, Manager Watkins stated yes and that the full cost of the personnel and
       rental rates for their trucks would be included on the invoice.

XVI.   COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

       10.      Emergency Operations Center Activation Recap Discussion, Chief
                Clark
                Supervisor Fletcher acknowledged the extra work and long hours that the
                Fire Department put in during the emergency and stated that the
                department did a great job.

                Fire Chief John Clark stated that the EOC is part of the Fire Department,
                and is the only one beside that of Eaton County. The Emergency Operation
                Center (EOC) is a support center to emergency operations, public safety
                and events.

                The Fire Department went active 9:30 p.m. the night preceding the actual
                ice storm. Staffing levels are normally at 11-13 daily and were staffed at 11
                that day.

                As the storm continued and the temperatures were unchanged, it became
                apparent the EOC would need to be activated and was at 11:00a.m.
                December 22, 2013 and operated continuously until 12:00p.m. on
                December 23, 2013. Activation levels vary from full scale to partial. In this
                case it was a partial activation and included all Department Managers;
                Assistant Fire Chief Roman activated the plan, organized all administrative
TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2014 TOWNSHIP BOARD MINUTES ­ REGULAR MEETING
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA
Page 16 of 20


          staff and developed the initial plan which was to identify all known current
          and anticipated problems the storm caused and formulating a plan.

          The initial plan included how to take care of the residents and how those
          who needed to be moved would be transported, damage assessment, utility
          restoration liaison. A subsequent 12 hour plan was developed due to the
          severity and breadth of the storm.

          The EOC is tasked with ensuring the Fire and EMS response is working,
          public safety and notification residents to the extent possible. Fire Chief
          Clark stated one of the challenges is that today society is driven by internet,
          computers and television, and that radio does not have the listenership it
          once did. The EOC also identify high risk population and residents. Fire
          Chief Clark stated that Mark Graham and the Assessing Department have a
          pretty good handle on these populations since they interact with those
          occupants on a regular basis. Of the senior living facilities in Delta
          Township, there is only 1 Skilled Nursing Facility ­ which is also the only
          one required to have backup power. All others were without a backup
          power source ­ therefore no water sprinklers, fire alarms, no heat, no way to
          cook.

          Fire Chief Clark addressed the local utility response in regard to Delta
          Township's water and sewer. Utility Director Tom Morrissey and his
          department had some challenges in keeping water running in the Township
          and more importantly keeping the wastewater flowing in the right direction.
          Communications with Consumer's Energy and BWL were good, however
          the Township has no authority to direct where they restore first as those are
          decisions internal to their organizations.

          Supervisor Fletcher stated he disagreed and did not feel there was good
          communication with BWL. Fire Chief Clark restated that the Township was
          providing information and BWL was accepting the information without
          feedback and some notifications were lost. Fire Chief Clark states that
          those are things that can be improved by improving relationships and
          improving their operating procedures.

          Fire Chief Clark states that Fire and EMS normally respond to 15-25 calls
          per 24 hour period, during this emergency about 250 calls were responded
          to in a 48 hour period, approximately 150 in the first 12 hours. Calls into
          911 are answered by the County and are dispatched. The Township has
          the ability to do its own dispatching and assumed that responsibility and
          continued it for approximately 19 hours. This gave the Township the ability
          to ask a few more questions and be able to plot things together as well as
          prioritizing calls. Central dispatch does that function on a regular basis
TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2014 TOWNSHIP BOARD MINUTES ­ REGULAR MEETING
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA
Page 17 of 20


          however in this type of overwhelming situation, they are unable to prioritize
          calls, and they just send them out.

          Treasurer Pizzo asked what types of calls were received. Fire Chief stated
          that the EMS calls remained relatively unchanged, the difference being was
          for lines down, fire runs, sparking wires.

          Fire Chief Clark stated that staff were held over their shifts, staff that were
          on 4 day offs were brought back about half way through, essentially the Fire
          Department was double staffed until Christmas Eve.

          Each Fire Department station has a natural gas powered generator which is
          run/tested weekly, those are maintained by the Utility Department and they
          ran flawlessly.

          Fire Chief Clark states that there was about 307 hours of OT in the Fire
          Department, 60 hours OT in the administrative staff (Chiefs are ineligible
          from OT). There was about 100 gallons of diesel fuel in addition,
          approximately $800 more in natural gas charges.

          Fire Chief Clark stated that full power restoration wasn't until after the first of
          the year. The After Action plan was schedule for January 6 th, which was the
          day of the snow storm which immobilized everyone. The meeting was then
          scheduled January 13, 2014.

          Fire Chief Clark stated that overall the plan of action went very well,
          however like any emergency you can always do better and need to do
          better. Fire Chief Clark stated the more time that lapses between
          emergencies, the more challenges there are with responses due to memory,
          phone number changes, etc.

          Fire Chief Clark summarized findings by stating the Township needs to
          establish more warming centers which are managed by the Red Cross. The
          Township facilitates use of them. Red Cross was challenged by the number
          of volunteers they had available, the holidays and the number of the centers
          they could get open. Some of the calls made to 211 were transferred to the
          overnight service and were not answered.

          Fire Chief Clark stated the last time a shelter needed to be used long term
          was in 2008 due to the tornados which was 5 years ago. Shelter sites can
          change, organizations change. In addition, the Red Cross had another tier
          they could have reached out to, and expectations and requirements need to
          be made clear. Delta Township is part of region 1 which is comprised of 7
          counties which meet monthly to go over these types of things.
TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2014 TOWNSHIP BOARD MINUTES ­ REGULAR MEETING
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA
Page 18 of 20



          Fire Chief Clark stated that GS mapping is another topic. While Community
          Development Director Mark Graham and others in his department were
          physically going out, getting information and bringing it back, there are
          better ways to do this, utilizing today's technology ­ some more expensive
          than others. The IT Department will be working on this.

          Fire Chief Clark states that pre-notifications put out by the news are
          standard information, alerting about the storm, get food and water etc.
          Some heeded the warnings most did not. Public education regarding
          prevention needs to be put out repetitively for long periods of time, before it
          is cold.

          Fire Chief Clark stated that some internal activities were use of the white
          board to track activity. The electronic version for the State just came online.
          Staff EOC and Fire had a great response from internal staff.

          Treasurer Pizzo noted that due to the heavy snowfall, many fire hydrants
          were buried and believes it is important to remind people to keep these
          clear.

          Fire Chief Clark stated that it is and will continue to be part of the
          preparedness message and that when available during the most recent
          storm; one person was working to uncover the hydrants. It does however
          continue to be the residents' responsibility.

          Trustee Mojica asked if there is an answer regarding why some homes
          within an area had power and others did not. Fire Chief Clark stated that it
          has to with the timing of construction and being placed on the power grid.
          Fire Chief Clark also stated that restoration efforts are always focused on
          largest populous areas, then focused on smaller areas of population. Fire
          Chief Clark states that there is really no good way to do this.

          An audience member asked if there was a plan for educating people about
          the use of generators as well as whether there would be some type of
          purchasing arrangement. Fire Chief Clark stated that a brief video could be
          made showing an overview of the basics relating to generators. In terms of
          purchasing arrangements, while there are governmental surplus sales,
          these sales are often restricted to certain buyers and often other restrictions
          are attached as well. The best preparedness is not to wait until the
          emergency occurs to get one. Smaller ones can be purchased somewhat
          inexpensively.

          An audience member asked why the National Guard wasn't activated. Fire

          Chief Clark stated that National Guard Activation requires a State
          Declaration by the Governor and that was never made.

          Supervisor Fletcher asked Fire Chief Clark to address some main topics
          such as Governor involvement, why wasn't there more support from the
          State, questions about the National Guard, etc.

          Fire Chief Clark stated that Delta Township made a local declaration of a
          State of Emergency which enables the Township to operate under abnormal
          guidelines, with purchasing one of the significant differences.      This
          declaration also allows recall of personnel.

          Fire Chief Clark stated that the Township can then request State assistance
          under Public Act 390, which is a statement of basically ­ the Township has
          exhausted all resources which does not include personnel. Neither the Fire
          or Police department had exhausted their personnel resources during the
          ice storm. In regard to storm debris, the available resources would only be
          to remove a blockage from the street to the side ­ not complete removal.

          Fire Chief Clark stated the next step would be the Governor making a State
          Declaration and the key to this is property damage. This does not include
          power lines and such.

          Fire Chief Clark states that there is a program called "Do 1 T hing", which is
          a campaign relating to emergency preparedness. People often are more
          willing to listen to preparedness information when the weather is not
          necessarily nice out. There is also a form that you can fill out and put it on
          your refrigerator that gives emergency responders important information if
          you are unable to communicate the information yourself.

          Smart 911 is a smart website that users can load health information and
          photos for themselves and family members. This information can only be
          "unlocked" once you call 911. You can also set up contacts that are
          automatically notified in case of emergency.

          Trustee Fedewa noted that the lack of traffic control at several major
          intersections for several days was a problem. Lieutenant Jeff Campbell
          stated that they have those signs just for that purpose, however it became a
          liability issue and if people could not see the signs it becomes a safety
          hazard. Supervisor Fletcher requested that a representative of the Eaton
          County Sheriff's Office attend the next meeting to discuss that point. Clerk
          Clark noted we do not have sufficient ECSO staff to cover prolonged traffic
          light outages and that current state statute requires drivers to treat non-
          working traffic lights like a 4 way stop. Township Manager Watkins stated

                  that in meetings concerning the EOC (Emergency Operation Center),
                  discussions are underway to improve the response and public education
                  concerning emergency information.

                  Supervisor Fletcher noted that in hindsight of any emergency, there are
                  always things that can be done better however it is an opportunity to
                  develop a plan to do better next time. Supervisor Fletcher noted that he felt
                  that things went pretty well in the Township, but is looking forward to refining
                  the plan.

SUBJECT:       Additional Credited Service for Donald Fox, Fire Department

Paramedic Firefighter Donald Fox, Delta Township Fire Department employee, has requested he
be allowed by Municipal Employees Retirement System (MERS) to purchase an additional one
(1) month of additional credited service (generic time). The Bargaining Unit Agreement, Article
51.3 allows for the purchase of up to five (5) years of either military, past service, or generic
time.

After reviewing the form as presented by Mr. Fox and MERS, I hereby offer the following
resolution:

        "As provided by the MERS Plan Document, the one (1) month additional credited
        service is granted this member by resolution adopted by the Township Board of the
        Charter Township of Delta at its meeting on February 3, 2014. It is understood that
        calculation of the actuarial cost is based on the assumptions approved by the MERS
        Retirement Board on the date the calculation was prepared. Actual, future events and
        experience may result in changes different from those assumed, and liability different
        from that estimated, and

        Furthermore, the employee (Donald Fox) will be responsible and is required to pay the
        full cost of the purchase for the credited service."

MEMO

TO:                    Township Board
                       Delta Charter Township

FROM:                  Christopher Gruba, Planner
                       Community Development Department

DATE:                  January 27, 2014

SUBJECT:               Final action for Louis J. Eyde Family, LLC Rezoning Request, Case No. 10-
                       13-18.

On May 21, 2013, the Township received a rezoning application submitted by Mr. Richard Cooley
on behalf of the Louis J. Eyde Family, LLC to rezone 21.76 acres from RC, Moderate Density
Residential to B2, Community Commercial and 41.70 acres from RB, Low Density Residential and
RC, Moderate Density Residential to RE, High Density Residential (Figure 1).

The requested 21.76 acres of B2, Community Commercial, is located to the north of the existing 7.5
acre retention pond along Marketplace Boulevard. The proposed B2 zoning would match the
existing zoning for Walmart, Petsmart, Staples, etc. The applicant has stated an intention of
continuing this style of commercial development south to the retention pond, although no site plan
has been submitted.

The requested 41.7 acres of RE, High Density Residential, is located to the south of the 7.5 acre
retention pond and includes the retention pond. Approximately 34 acres of the 41.7 acres would be
buildable, as the retention pond will not be filled in and developed. This 41.7 acre area is currently
zoned RB, low density residential, and RC, Moderate Density Residential. The applicant has stated
an intention of developing this land for multi-family residential, either in the form of apartments or
condos, although no site plan has been submitted. The existing RB and RC zoning allows for 3.63
and 4.36 dwelling units per acre respectively. The proposed RE zoning allows for 11 dwelling units
per acre. When doing the math, the proposed RE zoning would allow for up to 375 apartment/condo
units by right. This figure may be increased to 510 with the issuance of a special land use permit to
develop the land as a Planned Unit Development (PUD). The RB zoning district permits a
maximum of 2 units per building (with an SLU permit for a PUD) and the RC district permits a
maximum of 6 units per building (with an SLU permit for a PUD).

A traffic assessment (Figure 8) has been submitted by TEA Inc., which is required with a rezoning
application. Section 27.4.0 D2 of the Zoning Ordinance mandates that the traffic study shall
"contrast the traffic impacts of the proposed use, or of a typical use permitted..." The traffic
assessment that was submitted takes into account the potential commercial square footage and
potential number of residential units. Traffic statistics are given for the carrying capacity of
Marketplace Boulevard, and the study concludes that the road will be able to adequately serve the
future development. It should be noted that the study does not address traffic at the intersections of
Marketplace/Saginaw Highway and Marketplace/St. Joe Highway.

The Planning Commission held public hearings regarding this rezoning request on November 11,
2013, December 9, 2013 and January 13, 2014 as follows:

                                                                                                     1
       At the November 11, 2013 Planning Commission meeting, several Township residents
       expressed concerns regarding the proposed RE, high density residential rezoning. As
       submitted, the proposed RE rezoning would permit 375 units by right. This number could be
       increased to 510 if the applicant applied for a special land use permit for a PUD. The
       Planning Commission also had reservations regarding the proposed residential density and
       subsequently tabled the application until a revision depicting a reduction in residential
       density could be submitted. The Planning Commission was however, amenable to the
       proposed B2, commercial rezoning.

       At the December 9, 2013 Planning Commission meeting, Mr. Cooley submitted a revised
       rezoning proposal (Figure 2). The proposed 21.76 acres of B2, Community Commercial
       remained unchanged. The residential portion of the rezoning was reduced by proposing
       33.27 acres of RE (including the retention pond), High Density Residential and 8.43 acres of
       RD, Medium Density Residential. The proposed RD and RE zoning would allow for a total
       of 343 units by right, a reduction from 375. In response to the previous meeting, staff also
       prepared two other rezoning scenarios that illustrated a reduction in residential density. One
       scenario included rezoning the entire 41.70 acres from RC to RD, Medium Density
       Residential (Fig 3). Another scenario split the 41.70 acres into ½ RD and ½ RE (Fig 4). The
       Planning Commission moved to recommend approval of the 21.76 acres of B2, which passed
       by a vote of 7-0 (MacLaren, Laforet absent). The Planning Commission also moved to
       recommend denial of the initial rezoning request for the entire 41.70 acres to be rezoned to
       RE by a vote of 7-0. The Planning Commission moved to recommend approval to rezone the
       entire 41.70 acres to RD, but this motion failed 4-3 (Schweitzer, Cascarilla, Lathrop against).
       The Planning Commission then moved to recommend approval to split the 41.70 acres
       evenly between RD and RE, but this motion also failed 4-3 (Schweitzer, Gabriel, Mudry
       against). As a compromise between the two failed motions, Mr. Gruba suggested that 15.29
       acres be rezoned to RE, and 26.41 acres be rezoned to RD. This suggestion represents a
       buildable layout of ¼ RE, ¾ RD, which is midway between the entire RD option and the ½
       RD, ½ RE option. The Planning Commission subsequently tabled the residential portion of
       the rezoning application due to the aforementioned "deadlock" votes.

        At the January 13, 2014 Planning Commission meeting, the Planning Commission moved to
        recommend approval of the ¼ RE, ¾ RD option as presented by staff (Figure 5) by a vote of
        8-0 (Lathrop absent). This concluded the review of the rezoning requests by the Planning
        Commission.

For the Township Board meeting on February 3, 2014, the Board must first act upon the initial
rezoning application as submitted (Figure 1). The Township Board may then choose to elect one of
the other rezoning scenarios, including the scenario recommended by the Planning Commission
(Figure 5). Since the January 13th Planning Commission meeting, the applicant has chosen to
prepare and submit a legal description for Figure 5 (the Planning Commission's recommendation), as
illustrated in Figure 7. Several motions have been offered by staff relating to the proposed
commercial rezoning and relating to the proposed residential rezoning:

The Planning Commission passed the following motion for the commercial portion on 12-9-13:

I move that the Delta Township Board approve the request to rezone an area of
approximately 21.76 acres as described in Case No. 10-13-18 from RC, Moderate Density
Residential, to B2, Community Commercial, based on the following findings:

1.      The rezoning request meets the criteria in section 25.4.0 of the Delta Township
        Zoning Ordinance as follows:

        a.     The area in question possesses physical features compatible with the
               proposed zoning district as follows:
               1.    The properties to the north & east of the subject parcel are already
                     zoned B2.
               2.    The existence of a 7+ acre detention pond on the southern boundary
                     of the subject parcel provides a proper transition to the residential
                     uses recommended to the south on the Future Land Use Map in the
                     Delta Township Comprehensive Plan.

2.      The proposed B2 zoning district will conform to the goals & polices in the
        Comprehensive Plan and section 1.2.0, Purpose, of the Zoning Ordinance as follows:

        a.     The Future Land Use Map in the Comprehensive Plan recommends
               commercial land uses on the subject parcel.

        b.     The infrastructure in the vicinity of the subject parcel is adequate to serve
               the commercial land uses permitted in the B2 zoning district as follows: 16"
               water main and a 12" sanitary sewer are located within the Marketplace
               Boulevard right of way, the Lazell Drain serves the property, Marketplace
               Boulevard has five lanes adjacent to the subject parcel, there are traffic
               signals at the Marketplace/West Saginaw and Marketplace/St. Joe
               intersections, the M-43/I-96 interchange is located approximately a half mile
               from the property, and there are sidewalks along the majority of the
               Marketplace Boulevard frontage.


                                                                                                 3
       c.     The landscaping & building setback requirements of the Zoning Ordinance,
              as well as site plan review by the Planning Commission, can insure
              compatibility between the future residential uses to the west and the planned
              commercial uses on the subject parcel.

The Planning Commission passed the following motion for the residential portion on 12-9-13:

"I move that the Delta Township Board deny the request to rezone an area of
approximately 41.7 acres as described in Case No. 10-13-18 from RB, Low Density
Residential, and RC, Moderate Density Residential, to RE, High Density Residential as
illustrated in Figures 1 & 10, based on the following findings:

1.     The rezoning request doesn't meet the purposes of the Delta Township Zoning
       Ordinance as specified in section 1.2.0, as follows:

       a.     The proposed RE zoning district doesn't constitute orderly development.
              There is presently an adequate supply of vacant land zoned RD, Medium
              Density Residential, and RE, High Density Residential, within 2 miles of the
              subject parcel:

              -      Mike Eyde Property, sec. 15, 320 d.u. approved via a 2001 Consent
                     Judgment
              -      Townsend Apts., sec. 18, 280 d.u. approved via a 2002 Consent
                     Judgment
              -      Bank-Owned Property, sec. 10, estimated 24 d.u. with RD zoning
              -      Willow Trace Condos/Apts, sec. 10, estimated 16 d.u. with RD zoning
              -      Leo Stein Property, sec. 14, estimated 54 d.u. with RE zoning

       b.     Adequate transportation services are not provided to the subject parcel due
              to the lack of line-haul public transit service.

       c.     Adequate recreational facilities are not provided to the subject parcel due to
              a lack of public parks within one mile.

2.     The Traffic Impact Study submitted by the applicant doesn't meet the requirements
       of section 27.4.0 C, Traffic Impact Study Contents, as follows:

       a.     The existing daily & peak hour traffic volumes at the intersections which are
              expected to be impacted, being the Marketplace/West Saginaw, Commercial
              Drive/West Saginaw, and Marketplace/St. Joe intersections, were not
              analyzed.

       b.     The existing levels of service at the above intersections were not calculated.

3.     The applicant has made no commitment to the construction of a new East-West
       road between Marketplace Boulevard and Broadbent Road in the interior of section
       16 as recommended in the Comprehensive Plan."


                                                                                               4
The Planning Commission passed the following motion for the residential portion on 1-13-14:

"I move that the Delta Township Board approve the request to rezone an area of
approximately 41.7 acres as described in the amended legal description for Case No. 10-13-
18 from RB, Low Density Residential, and RC, Moderate Density Residential, to 26.37
acres RD, Medium Density Residential, and 15.33 acres RE, High Density Residential, as
illustrated in Figures 5 and 7, based on the following findings:

1.      The rezoning request meets the criteria in section 25.4.0 of the Delta Township
        Zoning Ordinance as follows:

        a.      The area in question possesses physical features compatible with the
                proposed zoning district due to the existence of a 7+ acre detention pond on
                the northern boundary of the subject parcel provides a proper transition to
                the commercial uses recommended to the north on the future land use map in
                the Comprehensive Plan.

2.      The proposed RD and RE zoning districts will conform to the goals & policies in the
        Comprehensive Plan and section 1.2.0, Purpose, of the Zoning Ordinance as follows:

        a.      The Future Land Use Map in the Delta Township Comprehensive Plan
                recommends Multiple Family Residential land uses on the subject parcel.

        b.      The infrastructure in the vicinity of the subject parcel is adequate to serve
                the multiple family residential uses permitted in the RD and RE zoning
                districts as follows: 16" water main and a 12" sanitary sewer are located
                within the Marketplace Boulevard right of way, the Lazell Drain serves the
                property, Marketplace Boulevard has five lanes adjacent to the subject
                parcel, there are traffic signals at the Marketplace/West Saginaw and
                Marketplace/St. Joe intersections, the M-43/I-96 interchange is located
                approximately a half mile from the property, and there are sidewalks along
                the majority of the Marketplace Boulevard frontage.

        c.      The landscaping and building setback requirements of the Zoning
                Ordinance, as well as site plan review by the Planning Commission, can
                insure compatibility between the future lower density residential land uses to
                the south and west and the commercial land uses to the north."

Marketplace Rezoning Request 2013 (January 13, 2014 PC meeting)
Case No. 10-13-18
Page 2

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

      The Eyde Company intends to rezone 62.79 acres of low-density residential land to
      commercial and high-density residential zoning. On November 11, 2013, the Planning
      Commission first reviewed this rezoning which requested B2, Community Commercial
      (21.76 acres) and RE, High Density Residential (41.70 acres). At this meeting, the
      Commission and residents expressed concerns regarding density and traffic pertaining to the
      proposed RE zoning and the item was tabled.

      On December 9, 2013, the proposed rezoning returned to the Planning Commission, but this
      time the applicants proposed a lower residential density. The revision again included 21.76
      acres for B2, but the residential component was divided into 8.43 acres for RD, Moderate
      Density Residential, and 25.74 acres for RE, High Density Residential. The Planning
      Commission approved a motion to approve of the 21.76 acres of B2 by a 7-0 vote.

      The Planning Commission made three motions regarding the proposed residential rezoning.
      The first motion recommended denial to rezone all of the 41.70 acres to RE, High Density
      Residential. This motion passed 7-0. The second motion was to rezone the entire 41.70
      acres to RD. The third motion was to split this acreage evenly between RD and RE zoning.
      The second and third motions each failed 4-3, since a successful motion requires the
      consensus of at least 5 commissioners. As a compromise between the last two motions,
      Planner Chris Gruba suggested a ¼ RE zone and a ¾ RD zone. Since an illustration had not
      been prepared depicting this suggestion, the residential portion of the rezoning was tabled
      until the January 13th meeting.

      The applicants have not changed their proposal since the December 9th Planning Commission
      meeting (fig 2). A table illustrating possible residential densities has been updated since the
      last meeting (fig 6). Since the Planning Commission previously recommended approval of
      the 21.72 acres of B-2 Commercial, a motion need only be made regarding the 41.70 acres of
      residential. Since the December 9th meeting, staff has not received any letters or inquiries
      regarding the residential rezoning.

      Attached to this report is new supplemental information:

             Figure 5, a separate option suggested by staff illustrating ¼ RE (8.43 buildable acres)
             and ¾ RD (25.74 buildable acres)

             dwelling units permitted and projected traffic generation, as prepared by the Planning
             Division. This table has been revised to include the Figure 5 option.

SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN:

      In 2012 the Planning Commission initiated a review of the Township's Comprehensive Plan
      with the assistance of Planning Consultants Birchler-Arroyo Associates. The Eyde
      Companies hired planning consultant Richard Cooley to submit a report to the Commission
      recommending additional commercial and multiple family residential land uses on their
      vacant properties immediately west of Marketplace Boulevard. Staff responded with a
      September 29, 2012 memo to the Planning Commission, identified as Work Paper #3, which
      addressed consultant Cooley's commercial and multiple family residential requests.

      In January of 2013, a new Comprehensive Plan was adopted by the Planning Commission.
      The Future Land Use map in the plan included the land use changes as generally proposed by
      Consultant Cooley. Therefore, the proposed rezoning of the subject parcels matches the
      Future Land Use recommendations in the 2013 Comprehensive Plan.

      Page 76 of the Plan reads:

      Multiple Family Residential development is typically characterized by multi-family
      apartment buildings which are three stories or less in height although other dwelling
      types, such as attached townhomes are permitted. The majority of dwelling units in the
      Multiple Family Residential category are presently rental units which is a pattern
      expected to continue in the future.

      Page 100 of the Plan pertains to Residential Growth & Development and reads:




                                                                                               8

            - Provide for residential development that will address the needs of all segments of
              the population while preserving existing neighborhoods and providing adequate
              room for growth.
            - Encourage residential development in locations possessing adequate infrastructure
              which are in close proximity to services and transportation facilities.
            - Provide regulations permitting a range of housing types accommodating various
              income and age groups.
            - Enhance the livability of residential areas by insuring that they're walkable,
              possess adequate open space and are compatible with adjacent non-residential
              areas.
            - Conduct a study of the existing Comprehensive Plan land use categories and the
              zoning ordinance districts to determine the possible merit for the creation of a
              "medium density" residential classification/district providing a density of 5 to 8
              units per acre.

      Page 101 of the Plan pertains to Commercial Growth & Development and reads:

            - Encourage infill development and/or redevelopment of commercial properties
              where adequate infrastructure exists.
            - Ensure that commercial development is compatible with adjacent residential land
              uses by addressing issues related to lighting, traffic, parking, signage, noise and
              landscaping.
            - Limit new commercial development on West Saginaw Highway to areas east of
              Broadbent Road.


RELEVANT ZONING ORDINANCE REGULATIONS:

      Multiple Family Residential

      Chapter 11 of the Delta Township Zoning Ordinance contains the land use regulations
      pertaining to the RD, Medium Density Residential, zoning district. Section 11.1.0 of the
      Zoning Ordinance states:

      It is the intent of this chapter to provide for medium density residential developments in
      portions of the Township served by public utilities and services. It is further intended to
      provide a means of developing vacant lands within established residential neighborhoods
      while preserving the residential character of those areas. This chapter also provides for
      the development of certain non-residential facilities which can provide convenient
      services while at the same time preserving the overall residential character of the same
      district.




                                                                                                    9

      Chapter 12 of the Delta Township Zoning Ordinance contains the land use regulations
      pertaining to the RE, High Density Residential, zoning district. Section 12.1.0 of the Zoning
      Ordinance states:

      It is the intent of this chapter to provide for high density residential developments in
      portions of the Township served by public utilities and services, and collector or arterial
      streets. It is expected that high density residential developments will be provided with or
      have close access to recreational facilities and open space.

      Schedule B of the Zoning Ordinance contains the applicable site development standards for
      the RD and RE zoning districts. Section 25.4.0 of the Zoning Ordinance contains the criteria
      that must be evaluated when considering a rezoning request.


      Commercial

      Chapter 14 of the Delta Township Zoning Ordinance contains the land use regulations
      pertaining to the B2, Community Commercial, zoning district. Section 14.1.0 of the Zoning
      Ordinance states:

      It is the intent of this chapter to provide for certain commercial enterprises designed to
      provide convenient shopping and service opportunities in neighborhood and other
      outlying areas as may be designated in the Comprehensive Plan. In general these areas
      will be limited in size and number of locations. As such, the regulations for these
      commercial areas are designed to ensure compatibility with surrounding land uses by
      limiting their intensity and impact on adjoining streets and properties.

      Schedule C of the Zoning Ordinance contains the applicable site development standards for
      the B2 zoning district. Section 25.4.0 of the Zoning Ordinance contains the criteria that must
      be evaluated when considering a rezoning request.


ZONING HISTORY:

      On February 11, 1952, the Delta Township Board zoned the subject parcels E, Agricultural.

      On March 16, 1970, a new Township Zoning Ordinance and map became effective. The
      subject parcels were zoned E, Agricultural.

      On September 14, 1974, a new Township Zoning Ordinance and map became effective. The
      subject parcels were renamed A2, Agricultural/Residential.




                                                                                                   10
Community Development Department Staff Report#3
Marketplace Rezoning Request 2013 (January 13, 2014 PC meeting)
Case No. 10-13-18
Page 6

      On December 14, 1990, A new Zoning Ordinance and map became effective. The subject
      parcels remained A2, Agricultural/Residential.

      On May 14, 1997, the Township Board rezoned the majority of the subject properties from
      A2, Agricultural/Residential, to RC, Moderate Density Residential, in Case No. 12-96-36,
      which was not the RE, High Density Residential classification requested by the Eyde
      Company.

      On November 14, 1994, representatives of Gove Associates, the Eyde Company's planning
      consultant at the time, presented a "concept master plan" for the Marketplace area to the
      Township Board. The "concept Master Plan" recommended a "step down" approach with
      the most intense land uses (commercial) being recommended adjacent to I-96, multiple
      family residential uses adjacent to the commercial, and the least intense use (low density
      residential) adjacent to Broadbent Road. The recommended depth of the commercial
      development was approximately 2500 ft. at I-96 decreasing to approximately 1800 ft. in the
      middle of the section and then further decreasing to a depth of approximately 1200 ft. at
      Broadbent Road. This "step down" approach was recommended for the area on both sides of
      West Saginaw Highway between I-96 and Broadbent Road. The "step down" approach was
      adopted by the Township Board when they rezoned the Eyde property on the south side of
      West Saginaw Highway to commercial (Case No. 9-93-20 on July 5, 1995). At the time the
      Township Board wanted the land development patterns for the northwest corner of the I-
      96/M-43 intersection to match the patterns on the southwest corner of the intersection.

      In 1997, the Township Board denied the Eyde Company's request for an RD, Medium
      Density Residential, zoning classification on the subject parcel and instead granted an RC,
      Moderate Density Residential classification. The Board's motion indicated that the RC
      zoning classification was being stipulated because the RC district conformed to the Goals &
      Policies of the Comprehensive Plan and that the proposed zoning change was justified by
      changes in conditions since the Comprehensive Plan was last reviewed in 1995.

      Sanitary Sewer

      A 12" sanitary sewer line exists in the center of Marketplace Boulevard, but terminates just
      south of Executive Drive.

      Storm Drainage

      The vacant subject parcels are part of the Lazelle Drainage District, under the jurisdiction of
      the Eaton County Drain Office. The existing retention pond that would separate the
      proposed commercial zoning from the proposed RE residential zoning is located within a 7.5
      acre easement controlled by the Drain Office. Storm drains exist along portions of
      Marketplace Boulevard, some of which drain to the 7.5 acre pond and others drain to the
      existing pond at the northeast corner of the Marketplace/St. Joe intersection.


STREETS AND TRAFFIC:

      As it exists today, Marketplace Boulevard traverses through developed land at the north to
      farmland at the south. It is 5 lanes wide, but narrows to 3 lanes near the intersection with St.
      Joe Highway. Sidewalks have been installed on both sides with the exception of a 600 ft.
      gap on the west side of Marketplace just north of St. Joe Highway. There are no posted
      speed limits on Marketplace Boulevard. Per a traffic count performed by the Eaton County
      Road Commission in June of 2010, there was an average of 5,338 vehicles per day passing
      the midway point of Marketplace Boulevard. The proposed multiple family residential
      development would have access only via Marketplace Boulevard. Marketplace Boulevard is
      under the jurisdiction of the Eaton County Road Commission.

      Section 19.10.0 A (13) of the zoning ordinance (site plan review) states that
      developments generating more than 500 trips per day shall be required to provide a
      second access point. The Comprehensive Plan's Transportation chapter recommends the
      construction of an east-west road in the interior of section 16. Page 49 of the Plan reads:

             Minor Road Projects

             The following roads are recommended in order to provide connectivity in specific
             areas of the Township. It's assumed that these roads will be constructed as public
             streets by private parties at the time adjacent properties are developed.

             Sections 9 & 16 East-West Roads

             Construction of new east-west roads in the interior of section 9 and 16, west of I-
             96. The interior road in section 16 would extend from Broadbent Road to
             Marketplace Boulevard.

                                                                                                   12
Community Development Department Staff Report#3
Marketplace Rezoning Request 2013 (January 13, 2014 PC meeting)
Case No. 10-13-18
Page 8


      It's assumed that the recommended east-west road in the interior of section 16 would be
      addressed by the Planning Commission at the time a site plan is submitted for multiple
      family residential development on the subject parcel. However, it should be noted that
      Broadbent Road between St. Joe Highway and West Saginaw is two lanes with no curb &
      gutter, no sidewalks and no traffic signal at the Broadbent/West Saginaw intersection.
      Broadbent Road isn't recommended for widening in the 2035 Regional Transportation
      Plan.


      Traffic Assessment

      A traffic assessment regarding the proposed zoning changes was prepared by Traffic
      Engineering Associates (TEA) in September 2013. This study took into account the traffic
      generated by the first proposal, which referred to B2 (21.76 acres) and RE (41.70). The
      study indicated that Marketplace Boulevard would be able to accommodate the increase of
      traffic generated if the subject parcels were rezoned to B2 and RE as initially requested.

      The current rezoning proposal would decrease the residential density by 10%, by way of the
      RD zoning. Therefore, the TEA traffic assessment is not reflective of the decrease in density.
      However, any reduction in density would result in a reduction of traffic. As prepared by
      staff, Figure 2 provides a general traffic assessment relative to various residential densities.

      Since the November 11th Planning Commission meeting, exact traffic counts on Marketplace
      Boulevard were obtained from the Eaton County Road Commission (Figure 3). These counts
      were sampled between June 7th and June 9th, 2010. This chart details the hourly number of
      vehicles, both northbound and southbound. Between 2 a.m. and 6 p.m., there are more
      vehicles traveling northbound than southbound. Between 6 p.m. and midnight, this reverses.
      However, the northbound lane carries 21% more traffic per day.

      TEA Inc., with data from the Road Commission, also recently submitted traffic data relevant
      to the intersection at Marketplace Boulevard and St. Joe Highway (Figure 4). This data was
      collected on October 16, 2013, but was not available for the November 11th Planning
      Commission meeting. The turning movements of vehicles are detailed for the a.m., noon and
      p.m. rush hours. Figure 4 is only data, not a data analysis. It does not determine whether the
      intersection is at carrying capacity or nearing capacity.


PHYSICAL SITE CHARACTERISTICS:

      The topography of the subject parcels has an elevation of approximately 860 feet and is
      relatively flat. A detention pond exists in the northern area that is intended to serve as a
      natural break between the proposed B2 zoning to the north and the proposed RE zoning to

                                                                                                   13

       the south. The land north of the detention pond is heavily vegetated with mature trees. The
       land south of the detention pond is currently being used for farming.

       The Soil Survey of Eaton County indicates that the primary soil types on the site are of the
       Marlette-Capac association, which can be well-drained to somewhat poorly drained. These
       soil types may present building limitations ranging from moderate to severe due to wetness
       and frost action. Please be advised that this soil classification is general in nature and on-site
       soil borings would be necessary to determine actual building limitations.

       No portions of the subject parcels are located within a 100 year floodplain.


PROS & CONS RELATED TO THE RE HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL REZONING

Pros

1.     The RE rezoning request is compatible with the "Multiple Family Residential" land use
       classification depicted on the Future Land Use Map within the Delta Township
       Comprehensive Plan adopted by the Planning Commission on January 28, 2013.

2.     The infrastructure in the general vicinity of Marketplace Boulevard is adequate to serve
       the proposed "Multiple Family Residential" development based on the following: 16"
       water main & 12" sanitary sewer on Marketplace, 5 lane Marketplace Blvd. with traffic
       signals at St. Joe & West Saginaw, sidewalks along the majority of the Marketplace
       frontage, Lazell Storm Drain improvements, M-43/I-96 interchange approximately ½
       mile from subject parcel.

4.     Future residents on the subject parcel will have many services provided in close
       proximity by the existing retail development to the north. The residents will become
       retail customers helping to insure the long-term viability of the commercial areas to the
       north.

5.     It's assumed that eventually there will be a pent up demand for multiple family
       apartments in the Township. Only 96 apartment units were built in the 2004-2013 period.

6.     Several schools are located in relatively close proximity to the subject parcel as follows:
       Delta Center Elementary School on Canal Road, Willow Ridge Elementary School on
       Nixon Road and Hayes Middle School adjacent to Willow Ridge Elementary.

7.     Establishing multiple family residential development on the west side of Marketplace
       Boulevard represents a logical transition in land uses from east to west. Beginning at I-96
       on the east, to Office Development (Ceso Engineering, Auto Body Credit Union,
       Secretary of State Office), to Marketplace Boulevard, to the proposed multiple family

                                                                                                      14
Community Development Department Staff Report#3
Marketplace Rezoning Request 2013 (January 13, 2014 PC meeting)
Case No. 10-13-18
Page 10

       residential development, to proposed single family development to the west. The
       proposed multiple family residential development also creates a proper north-south
       transition in land uses on the west side of Marketplace from the retail stores on the north
       to the existing detention pond, to the proposed multiple family development to single
       family development on the north side of St. Joe Highway.

8.     Although the Future Land Use Map in the Comprehensive Plan recommends a "Multiple
       Family Residential" classification for approximately 100 acres of land within one mile of
       the subject parcel, none of this land has been rezoned to an RD or RE classification to
       make it ready for development.

Cons

1.     It could be argued that adequate "Multiple Family Residential" development has been
       recommended on the Comprehensive Plan's Future Land Use Map within approximately
       two miles of the subject parcel as follows:

                                             RD Zoning              RE Zoning

                                       Totals* 768     1056         1056     1440


* Totals don't include 280 pre-approved units in the Townsend on the Park Apartment Project on
West Saginaw west of Nixon Road which were approved in a 2002 Consent Judgment and have
yet to be built.

2.     At this time CATA transit service is not available to the subject parcel. There are no
       Township parks located in close proximity to the subject parcel.


Alternatives to the RE Zoning Request as Submitted

1.     Grant the requested RE classification on approximately half of the 41 acres abutting
       Marketplace Boulevard and the future east-west road and grant an RD classification on
       the remainder of the property. This would lower the number of dwelling units, provide
       for a transition from multiple family buildings adjacent to the existing/proposed roads to
       the future single family development to the south & west, and generate less traffic.

                                                                                                 15

Marketplace Rezoning Request 2013 (January 13, 2014 PC meeting)
Case No. 10-13-18
Page 11


2.    Grant an RD zoning classification rather than the requested RE classification. The RD
      classification would still permit 328 (by right) to 451 (PUD) units on the property and
      result in less traffic generation.

3.    Grant the RE zoning classification on only the northernmost 20 acres or the easternmost
      20 acres of the 41 acres proposed for rezoning. After this first phase of development is
      completed an additional rezoning request(s) could be submitted. This would also insure
      that the issue of the east-west access road could be addressed prior to the full build-out of
      the multiple family residential development.

4.    Deny the RE zoning classification and recommend to the applicant that they submit a
      Special Land Use Permit request for "Mixed Use Buildings" on the 21 acres requested for
      B2 zoning. The SLU Permit would permit the construction of buildings with retail on the
      ground floor and residential apartments above at a density of 10 units per acre.

5.    Grant the RE zoning classification on 15.29 acres and the RD zoning classification on
      25.74 acres, which equates to ¼ RE zoned land that is buildable and ¾ RD zoned land
      that is buildable.

General Comments Regarding the RE Zoning Request

1.    At this time the inventory of vacant land in the RD and RE zoning classifications is as
      follows:
      -       320 d.u., Mike Eyde Property, sec. 15, Approved via a 2001 CJ, RD zoning
      -       280 d.u., Townsend Apts., sec. 18, Approved via a 2002 CJ, RE zoning
      -       24 d.u., Bank-Owned Property, sec. 10, 3 ac. x 8 d.u./ac., RD zoning
      -       24 d.u., Remainder of Willow Trace Condos/Apts., sec. 10, RD zoning
      -       54 d.u., Leo Stein Property, sec. 14, 6.75 ac. x 11 d.u./ac., RE zoning
      -       13 d.u., Joyce Whitford Property, sec. 16, 1.7 ac. x 8 d.u./ac., RD zoning

2.    If a multi-family residential zoning classification (being RD or RE) is granted for the
      subject parcel, proper transitions between the proposed higher density housing types and
      the future adjacent lower density housing types should be provided. Among the issues to
      be addressed during site plan review for the multi-family development would be: number
      of units per building, height of buildings, location of parking areas, provision of open
      space, road access, etc.

3.    If the multiple family residential development is developed "by right", only the Planning
      Commission and not the Township Board would review the site plan. If a Special Land
      Use Permit for a Planned Unit Development (PUD) were granted for the subject parcel
      the Township Board would also review the site plan.



                                                                                                 16

Case No. 10-13-18

4.    Since major parks/open space areas aren't located in close proximity to the property
      requested for RE zoning, it's recommended that discussions take place between the Eyde
      Companies and the Eaton County Drain Commissioner regarding possible upgrades
      (landscaping & walking paths) for the 7 ½ acre storm water detention area so that it can
      serve dual utilitarian/recreational purposes.

5.    At this time there are no site plans pending at the Delta Township Community
      Development Department for multiple family residential developments.

________________________________________________________________________________

STAFF ANALYSIS
________________________________________________________________________________

      Section 25.4.0 of the Delta Township Zoning Ordinance establishes general standards
      for the Planning Commission to consider when evaluating rezoning requests. The
      following is a discussion of these standards as they relate to this case.

      1.     Are the physical, geological, hydrological, and other environmental
             characteristics and features compatible with the zoning district proposed?

             Natural features on the subject parcel are generally conducive for commercial and
             multiple family residential development. There may be some soils with building
             limitations on the site that would have to be addressed during the site plan review.
             Soil borings would be necessary to determine the type and distribution of the soils.

      2.     Will the zoning district, as amended, conform to the goals and policies expressed
             in the Delta Township Comprehensive Plan?

             The rezonings would be generally consistent with the future land use
             recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan. The Official Future Land Use Map
             within the Plan recommends commercial and multi-family residential development in
             the areas proposed to be rezoned.


      3.     Is the proposed zoning change justified by a change in conditions since the
             initial placement of the property in question in its current zoning district
             designation or by an error in the Official Zoning Map?

             The existing RB and RC zoning districts on the subject parcels were established in
             1997. There has been a significant amount of development in the Marketplace area
             during the past 16 years.



                                                                                               17
Community Development Department Staff Report#3
Marketplace Rezoning Request 2013 (January 13, 2014 PC meeting)
Case No. 10-13-18
Page 13

      4.     Is the proposed zoning change consistent with the purposes of the Zoning
             Ordinance?

             A.     Promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare:

                    In the opinion of staff, the proposed development does not represent a threat
                    to the public health, safety, and welfare by reason of, noise, dust, glare, odors,
                    etc.

             B.     The use of land be situated in appropriate locations and relationships:

                    The proposed rezoning and subsequent development is well-suited for the
                    location. As proposed, the B2, RD and RE zones would result in a logical
                    transition in land uses. A vacant RB zoned area of 45 acres will remain in
                    place along the south and west sides of the subject parcels and will therefore
                    not adversely affect the existing single family residential areas on these
                    borders.

             C.     To limit the overcrowding of land and congestion of population,
                    transportation and other public facilities and to efficiently provide for
                    public facilities and utilities:

                    The area has access to existing public water and sewer lines. Marketplace
                    Drive is an existing 5-lane road that can accommodate the increase in traffic
                    generated by the commercial and multiple family residential development.
                    Sidewalks are also in place along the majority of the Marketplace Boulevard
                    frontage.

             D.     To encourage the use of lands and natural resources in the Township in
                    accordance with their character and adaptability:

                    The soil types on the subject parcel range from well-drained to poorly
                    drained. Soil borings will be required to determine the exact location and
                    type of the soils, but should not preclude development from occurring.

             E.     To limit the improper use of land; to provide for the orderly
                    development of the Township; and to reduce hazards to life and
                    property:

                    The proposed zoning is consistent and compatible with the existing
                    development pattern in the immediate vicinity and does not present a threat or
                    hazard to life or property.



                                                                                                   18

                            Alternate Motions ­ Case No. 10-13-18

¼ RD & ¾ RE Zoning Request Submitted by the Eyde Co.


Motion for Approval

I move that the Delta Township Planning Commission recommend to the Delta Township Board
approval of the request to rezone an area of approximately 42 acres as described in the amended
legal description for Case No. 10-13-18 from RB, Low Density Residential, and RC, Moderate
Density Residential, to 8.43 acres RD, Medium Density Residential, and 25.74 acres RE, High
Density Residential, as illustrated in Figure 1, based on the following findings:

1.     The rezoning request meets the criteria in section 25.4.0 of the Delta Township Zoning
       Ordinance as follows:

       a.     The area in question possesses physical features compatible with the proposed
              zoning district due to the existence of a 7+ acre detention pond on the northern
              boundary of the subject parcel which provides a proper transition to the
              commercial uses recommended to the north on the future land use map in the
              Comprehensive Plan.

2.     The proposed RD and RE zoning districts will conform to the goals & policies in the
       Comprehensive Plan and section 1.2.0, Purpose, of the Zoning Ordinance as follows:

       a.     The Future Land Use Map in the Delta Township Comprehensive Plan
              recommends Multiple Family Residential land uses on the subject parcel.

       b.     The infrastructure in the vicinity of the subject parcel is adequate to serve the
              multiple family residential uses permitted in the RE zoning district as follows:
              16" water main and a 12" sanitary sewer are located within the Marketplace
              Boulevard right of way, the Lazell Drain serves the property, Marketplace
              Boulevard has five lanes adjacent to the subject parcel, there are traffic signals at
              the Marketplace/West Saginaw and Marketplace/St. Joe intersections, the M-43/I-
              96 interchange is located approximately a half mile from the property, and there
              are sidewalks along the majority of the Marketplace Boulevard frontage.



                                                                                                 19

       c.     The landscaping & building setback requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, as
              well as site plan review by the Planning Commission, can insure compatibility
              between the future lower density residential land uses to the south and west and
              the commercial land uses to the north.


Motion for Denial

I move that the Delta Township Planning Commission recommend to the Delta Township Board,
denial of the request to rezone an area of approximately 42 acres as described in the amended
legal description for Case No. 10-13-18 from RB, Low Density Residential, and RC, Moderate
Density Residential, to 8.43 acres RD, Medium Density Residential, and 25.74 acres RE, High
Density Residential, as illustrated in Figure 1, based on the following findings:

1.     The rezoning request doesn't meet the purposes of the Delta Township Zoning Ordinance
       as specified in section 1.2.0, as follows:

       a.     The proposed RD and RE zoning districts do not constitute orderly development.
              There is presently an adequate supply of vacant land zoned RD, Medium Density
              Residential, and RE, High Density Residential, within 2 miles of the subject
              parcel :

              -      Mike Eyde Property, sec. 15, 320 d.u. approved via a 2001 Consent
                     Judgment
              -      Townsend Apts., sec. 18, 280 d.u. approved via a 2002 Consent Judgment
              -      Bank-Owned Property, sec. 10, estimated 24 d.u. with RD zoning
              -      Willow Trace Condos/Apts, sec. 10, estimated 16 d.u. with RD zoning
              -      Leo Stein Property, sec. 14, estimated 54 d.u. with RE zoning

       b.     Adequate transportation services are not provided to the subject parcel due to the
              lack of line-haul public transit service.

       c.     Adequate recreational facilities are not provided to the subject parcel due to a lack
              of public parks within one mile.

2.     The Traffic Impact Study submitted by the applicant doesn't meet the requirements of
       section 27.4.0 C, Traffic Impact Study Contents, as follows:

       a.     The existing daily & peak hour traffic volumes at the intersections which are
              expected to be impacted, being the Marketplace/West Saginaw, Commercial
              Drive/West Saginaw, and Marketplace/St. Joe intersections, were not analyzed.

       b.     The existing levels of service at the above intersections were not calculated.

                                                                                                 20

XI     PLANNING DIRECTOR COMMENTS

       Mr. Graham noted that he had received an e-mail from Mr. Lathrop requesting
       that the Commission be notified of cases at the time the legal ad was placed in the
       newspaper. He said at the present time, the Commission received a packet of
       information approximately a week before their meeting, but notifying
       Commissioners at the time the legal ad was placed in the newspaper would
       provide them with three weeks advanced notice of when cases would be placed on
       their agenda. However, he pointed out that legal ads were not placed in the
       newspaper for site plan reviews.

Summary Record of Public Hearing for Case No. 10-13-18, Rezoning Request for 63.46
acres of land on the west side of Marketplace Boulevard, midway between Saginaw
Highway and St. Joe Highway.

Members in attendance:       Schweitzer, Cascarilla, Laforet, Gabriel, Lathrop, MacLaren,
                             McConnell, Mudry, and Ruswinckel.

Members absent:

Assistant Planner Chris Gruba illustrated a map for those in attendance of the existing zoning
classifications on properties along Marketplace Boulevard between Saginaw Highway to the
north and St. Joe Highway to the south. He noted that the Eyde Company had submitted an
application to rezone vacant property on the west side of Marketplace, north of the existing
detention pond, from RB, Low Density Residential and RC, Moderate Density Residential, to
RE, High Density Residential and B2, Community Commercial. He noted that the B2 zoning
would extend south from the exiting commercial center to the existing retention pond and the
proposed RE zoning would extend south and west of the existing retention pond. He noted that
the RE zoning classification permitted 11 dwelling units per acre by-right, however, the
developer could develop the property as a Planned Unit Development with a special land use
permit which would allow 15 dwelling units per acre. Mr. Gruba indicated property owners
within 300 feet of the subject parcel were notified of the proposed rezoning. However, he noted
that due to the large parcel sizes, very few surrounding property owners were notified per the
Michigan Zoning Enabling Act. He stated that four residents had contacted staff on this case to
inquire about traffic circulation and how the rezoning would affect St. Joe Highway and
Marketplace Boulevard. Mr. Gruba pointed out that St. Joe Highway and Marketplace Boulevard
were not designated truck routes, but trucks making local deliveries to the businesses along
Marketplace Boulevard would travel north to access Saginaw Highway.

Mr. Gruba said the Eyde Company owned a total of 108 acres which consisted of 40 acres of RC,
Moderate Density Residential and 68 acres of RB, Low Density Residential. He noted that the
applicant was requesting B2 on 21 acres and RE on 41 acres. Mr. Gruba stated that the applicant
had not submitted any specific site plans for the development of the parcels at this time.
However, he reminded Commissioners that since the site was over two acres in size, a site plan
would come before the Commission for their review. Mr. Gruba said at this point in time, it was
unknown whether there would be a connection to Broadbent Road from Marketplace Boulevard
to serve future development. He noted that a traffic study was prepared by TEA for the proposed
zoning changes which detailed existing and projected traffic counts along Marketplace
Boulevard, but did not include projected traffic generation at the Marketplace/Saginaw Highway
intersection or the Marketplace/St. Joe Highway intersection. Mr. Gruba stated the Zoning
Ordinance required that a landscaped buffer zone of at least 30 feet in width be installed on the
commercial property, as well as a landscaped buffer zone of 10 feet in width between the
proposed RE zoning and the existing RB zoning. He indicated that the proposed commercial
parcel was heavily wooded with mature trees and staff had recommended that the existing trees
on the site be preserved as part of the landscaping requirements. Mr. Gruba mentioned the fact
that the landscape requirements would also apply to parcels located to the west of the B2 zoning,



                                                                                               26
SUMMARY RECORD OF PUBLIC HEARING

as well as between the proposed RE zoning and the property that would remain zoned RB.

Mr. Gruba stated that the applicant had indicated that the boundaries of the parcels proposed for
rezoning had been selected to create a natural transition of intensity between the existing and
proposed land uses, as well as take advantage of the infrastructure that was in place and fit in as
best as possible with the surrounding single family homes. He noted that in January of 2013, the
Commission adopted a new Comprehensive Plan and that the Future Land Use Map
recommended the land use changes that were being proposed this evening by recommending
commercial zoning to the north of the detention pond and multiple family residential zoning to
the south and west of the detention pond. Mr. Gruba indicated that staff was in receipt of four
letters from property owners who were opposed to the proposed rezoning request.

Mr. Schweitzer said when the Eyde property was originally approved for development; it was his
understanding that there would be an access point from Marketplace to Broadbent Road.

Community Development Director Mark Graham said the Township's Comprehensive Plan's
Transportation Chapter pointed out future road improvements and recommended an east-west
interior road in Section 9, north of the Crippen Dealership, as well as an east-west interior road in
Section 16, between Broadbent and Marketplace. Mr. Graham noted that the construction of the
road would be concurrent with development, but he reminded the Commission that Broadbent
Road was a two-lane paved road without a traffic signal at the Saginaw/Broadbent Road
intersection.

Ms. Gabriel questioned if a second access point on Broadbent would be required, or was it just a
recommendation.

Mr. Graham noted that the Township had never acquired the right-of-way in Section 9 or 16
because it was always felt that acquiring right-of-way without knowing how the property would
be developed could be subject to change. However, he noted that staff would strongly
recommend a road between Broadbent and Marketplace at the time the property was developed.
Mr. Graham noted that there was approximately 50 undeveloped acres the Eyde Company owned
that would remain zoned RB which was located around the proposed RE zoning.

Ms. Cascarilla questioned if the reason why specific development plans had not been submitted
was because the developer didn't have any plans at this time, or whether they haven't shared that
information at this point.

Mr. Gruba commented that the developer did not have any plans at this time.

Ms. Cascarilla questioned if it was normal for a traffic study to not take the impacts on connector
roads into consideration.



                                                                                                   27
SUMMARY RECORD OF PUBLIC HEARING
CASE NO. 10-13-18
NOVEMBER 11, 2013

Mr. Gruba felt the applicant could better address Ms. Cascarilla's question.

Mr. Lathrop expressed concerns that there would be a loss of 40 acres of RC zoning and a gain of
approximately 41 acres of RE zoning. Mr. Lathrop asked staff to review the land use regulations
pertaining to the RD and RC zoning classifications.

Mr. Gruba stated that the RD and RE zoning classifications permitted multiple family dwelling
units and the RB and RC zoning classifications allowed single family homes.

Mr. Graham noted that the RD zoning district allowed 8 dwelling units per acre by-right and 11
dwelling units per acre with a PUD. The RE zoning district allowed 11 dwelling units per acre
by-right and 15 dwelling units per acre with a PUD. The existing RB zoning allowed 3.6
dwelling units per acre and the RC zoning allowed 4.35 dwelling units per acre with a PUD and
up to 5 dwelling units per acre. Mr. Graham indicated that the RC zoning district allowed two
attached dwelling units per building and up to 6 dwelling units with a PUD, but he noted that
typically the RB and RC zoning districts consisted of single family. He indicated that the
developer would have to obtain special land use permits for anything other than single family
dwellings with the existing zoning in place.

Mr. Mudry said the traffic study indicated that rezoning the property to an RE classification
would impact traffic by six times.

Mr. Gruba said the staff report incorrectly indicated that the rezoning of the subject parcels
would result in an additional 12,301 cars per day. However, he noted that the staff report should
have indicated that 12,301 cars would traverse Marketplace Boulevard per day if the proposed
rezoning was approved.

Mr. Schweitzer said if the maximum 517 units were fully developed, there would be
approximately 5,170 vehicle trips generated and that another 7,000 vehicle trips would be
generated by commercial development for a total of 12,000 trips per day.

Mr. Gruba noted that Mr. Mudry was correct and that the traffic impact from the proposed
development would be six times per a 24-hour period.

Mark Clouse, representing the Eyde Company, addressed the Planning Commission by stating
that approximately one and half years ago, Land Planner Richard Cooley presented
documentation to the Planning Commission regarding proposed amendments to the Township's
Comprehensive Plan. He noted that in January of 2013, the Planning Commission adopted
amendments to the Township's master plan that included the zoning classifications that were
being requested this evening. Mr. Clouse noted that they started working with potential users for
the site and each person that they spoke with was very glad that the Township's master plan



                                                                                                 28
SUMMARY RECORD OF PUBLIC HEARING

conformed to a few of their requirements, but he noted that everybody wanted to see the zoning
in place first. Mr. Clouse stated that they were trying to go through the steps one at a time and
that the first step was to have the master plan amended and adopted and the next step was to put
the zoning in place. He said once the zoning was secure and a specific user was interested, they
would present the Commission with a definitive plan.

Mr. Clouse stated that the multiple-family development would more than likely be a project that
they would develop and that they currently owned and managed apartment complexes in
Meridian Township, as well as in Bath Township, and that they also owned and managed a great
deal of commercial properties. Mr. Clouse pointed out that 7.5 acres of the 41 acre parcel was
used for storm water detention and could not be developed. He noted that David Sonnenberg
from TEA was present this evening to answer any questions the Commission may have regarding
the traffic study. Mr. Clouse pointed out that the traffic study contained information specific to
rezoning requests and that it was difficult to conduct traffic counts and levels of service at
various intersections without having specific plans in place. Mr. Clouse said it was their goal to
obtain zoning and then come back to the Commission at some point in the future with a specific
layout of the property at which time another traffic study would be submitted that would address
some of the questions the Commission had. Mr. Clouse said he would be happy to answer any
questions the Commission may have and that Richard Cooley was also present to answer
questions.

Ms. Gabriel questioned if the developer would consider a lesser density than allowed for in the
RE zoning district.

Mr. Clouse said the key to developing higher density in this location was the retail component
that already existed and that the residents of rental communities enjoyed being near the shopping
that was available to them. He noted that the higher density also allowed them to provide better
amenities. Mr. Clouse said during the Commission's review of the master plan, they discussed
conducting a special study of the area adjacent to the RB zoning because the Zoning Ordinance
didn't have any type of zoning classification that allowed something between single family and
higher density. He said it was their hope that the Planning Commission would conduct that study
soon so that they could develop a PUD for the entire area and submit one plan that illustrated
how everything would be integrated. Mr. Clouse noted that they would also work with staff and
the Planning Commission in determining the best location for an east-west road connection to
Broadbent.

Mr. Schweitzer inquired about the amenities Mr. Clouse had referred to.

Mr. Clouse said most apartment complexes provided a clubhouse, but they wanted to go beyond
the clubhouse and offer recreational and open space, both passive and active, an outdoor pool, as
well as provide garages and carports.



                                                                                                  29

Mr. Mudry noted that he utilized the Marketplace business corridor quite often and his usual
route he took was the St. Joe Highway/Marketplace entrance. Mr. Mudry expressed concerns
with Commercial Drive that was located between Bob Evans and Cracker Barrel and the fact that
the road didn't have any markings and seemed to be a "free for all" for motorists. He also
expressed concerns with motorists attempting to make left turns onto Saginaw Highway from
Commercial Drive without a traffic signal. Mr. Mudry said the other alternative was to utilize
the traffic signal at the Saginaw/Marketplace intersection which was the best choice, however, he
noted that backups already occurred at that intersection and he questioned what impact the
rezoning would have if it was approved.

Dave Sonnenberg, Traffic Engineer with TEA, Saranac, Michigan, stated that the traffic study the
Commission had been provided with was only a traffic assessment at this point in time. He said
the difference between a traffic assessment and a full impact study was that without a site plan,
they didn't know what was going to be developed in order to have any way of distributing traffic
on the road system. Mr. Sonnenberg said he was also familiar with the area, but he couldn't
determine whether there would be six times the amount of traffic generated at the intersection
until he had a site plan. He indicated that they had obtained 2010 traffic counts from the Eaton
County Road Commission to help determine the current capacity of Marketplace and what it
would be in the future if the rezoning was approved. However, he noted that at the present time,
traffic counts were approximately a 50/50 split on Marketplace and that it could probably be
assumed that half of the cars would go south and half of the cars would go north. He mentioned
that their traffic evaluation would also take into consideration the proposed east-west connector
and how it would impact traffic counts at the intersections.

Mr. Sonnenberg noted that a traffic model would be prepared that would actually show them
where the issues were and from that point, they would start mitigation measures. He said due to
the fact that the Saginaw/Marketplace intersection was under the jurisdiction of MDOT and the
St. Joe/Marketplace Boulevard was under the jurisdiction of the Eaton County Road
Commission, the developer would work with both of those entities to determine possible
mitigation that would address service levels. He also mentioned the fact that both the St.
Joe/Marketplace and the St. Joe/Broadbent intersections were brand new signalized intersections,
but it was difficult to determine how the proposed rezoning would impact those intersections
without a site plan. Mr. Sonnenberg said as part of their traffic study, their technicians would
conduct traffic counts during peak traffic periods at Saginaw Highway, Marketplace, and St. Joe
Highway and from those counts; they would evaluate what the current traffic counts were and
reevaluate service levels after the new traffic counts were added.

Mr. Mudry didn't feel an east-west connector road to Broadbent would help unless a traffic
signal was installed at the Broadbent/Saginaw Highway intersection. Mr. Mudry questioned if
Mr. Sonnenberg felt the traffic study presented a worst case scenario.




                                                                                               30

Mr. Sonnenburg said a rezoning traffic study took the maximum amount of traffic that could be
generated under the current zoning and compared it to the future zoning. He noted that when a
site was rezoned to a specific zoning, there was usually more than one use under that zoning
classification and that they took the worst case scenario under the new zoning classification, or
the existing zoning classification, if the site was still vacant.

Ms. Cascarilla said as she understood it, a traffic assessment was done for the proposal this
evening rather than a traffic study.

Mr. Sonnenburg said that was correct and that a traffic impact study would be prepared once they
had a specific site plan.

Ms. Cascarilla asked if the traffic assessment had estimated a worst case scenario of 12,000
vehicles trips per day.

Mr. Sonnenburg said that was correct and that 12,000 vehicles trips per day would be generated
when all of the parcels were developed under the proposed rezoning requests. He reminded the
Commission that 12,000 was a 24-hour traffic count.

Ms. Cascarilla said 12,000 cars within a 24-hour period was a projected traffic count taking into
consideration the rezoning requests.

Mr. Sonnenburg said that was correct.

Ms. Cascarilla said she was trying to understand why there wasn't information contained in the
traffic assessment about the connector streets if a worst case scenario could be estimated.

Mr. Sonnenburg noted that a traffic impact study only evaluated peak hour traffic periods which
typically were 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. and that there were times when Saturday afternoon peak
hour counts were taken when a shopping mall was developed. Mr. Sonnenburg noted that 12,000
vehicle trips per day that had been referenced this evening were over a 24-hour period and the
worst case scenario. Mr. Sonnenburg pointed out that they used a series of books that were put
together by the Institute of Transportation Engineers that provided categories for specific types of
uses that contained studies that had been done around the United States that provided statistical
research on the type of traffic that would be generated by a particular use. Mr. Sonnenburg noted
that what went here was more or less depended on the area and that there were a lot of
contingencies that went into where people shopped.

Ms. Gabriel said if the rezoning was recommended for approval this evening, it wouldn't mean
the Commission would have to approve a site plan in the future if it was found not to be
compatible.



                                                                                                    31

Mr. Gruba said the Commission would conduct site plan review, but as Mr. Clouse had stated,
another traffic study would be prepared when a site plan was submitted.

Mr. Lathrop said he would personally like to see a step down affect and split the RE portion of
the rezoning request into RD or RC from east to west. Mr. Lathrop felt there would be some
impact on traffic, but he didn't know what it would be and that it would just be a guestimate at
this point in time. Mr. Lathrop said he would feel more comfortable tabling the request this
evening so that a traffic assessment could be done on the RE, RD, and RC districts so that a more
informed decision could be made.

Ms. Laforet questioned if the Commission had the ability to approve a site plan based on the
applicant pursuing a traffic signal at the Saginaw/Broadbent Road intersection.

Mr. Graham noted that MDOT just conducted a traffic study at the intersection and found that the
intersection didn't meet signal warrants. He didn't feel it was fair to the applicant, or citizens, to
mandate that obtain MDOT's approve for a traffic signal because they wouldn't approve a traffic
signal at that intersection until it met signal warrants.

Mr. Clouse didn't feel the traffic counts on Broadbent were sufficient to warrant a traffic signal
at that intersection.

Mr. Sonnenburg said there were eight warrants that MDOT looked at, but the number one
warrant they looked at was that there had to be a combination of so many cars in an eight hour
period on the main street and the same amount of cars in an eight hour period on the side street.
He said being familiar with the area, Saginaw Highway more than met the eight hour volume, but
Broadbent didn't have enough traffic to meet the required traffic volume.

Mr. Clouse noted that until traffic volumes increased on Broadbent, the traffic warrants would
not be met. He said once access was provided on Broadbent Road, the intersection may qualify
for a traffic signal. He also felt that once a site plan was submitted, MDOT would be made
aware of proposed development that may occur in the area.

Mr. Graham said staff continually met with MDOT officials and provided them with updates and
information of proposed development.

Mr. Sonnenberg said he had worked with MDOT all over the state on different developments and
unless a large supercenter was being built, MDOT would not install a traffic signal based on
future volumes, but rather they wanted to see the traffic on the road before they would install a
traffic signal.

Ms. Ruswinckel said when she used to live in this area of the Township, she would go out of her



                                                                                                     32

way in an east or west direction in order to avoid the Saginaw/Broadbent Road intersection and
she was sure that everyone else that lived in the area would agree.

Mr. Graham addressed Mr. Lathrop's comment regarding step down zoning by noting that half of
the property could be rezoned to RE and the other half could be rezoned to either RD or RC.
However, he wanted the Commission to understand that it would be creating an "artificial" line
and not reflective of any site plan or layout.

Mr. Lathrop felt the Commission would be stuck with the zoning line as proposed if the rezoning
was approved.

Mr. Graham said that was correct.

Ms. Gabriel said if the Commission recommended approval of the rezoning this evening, she
questioned whether the Commission could change their minds in terms of the layout of the site.

Mr. Graham felt the Commission could change their minds as far as the layout of the site, but the
35 acres of RE zoning would still permit the developer to build 11 dwelling units per acre by-
right which was a total of 360 dwelling units.

Mr. Clouse noted that Club Meridian and Central Park apartment complexes were in the 400 unit
range similar to what they wanted to develop in Delta. He noted that the complexes consisted of
two and three story buildings which provided the economics needed to provide additional
amenities.

Mr. Graham said 35 acres of RD zoning would allow eight units per acre by-right totaling 280
dwelling units.

Mr. Lathrop said the existing infrastructure that was in place was inadequate to accommodate the
additional traffic volumes and the only way we could impact the traffic was by approving a lower
density and making sure the property wasn't entirely zoned RE. Mr. Lathrop stated that he was
in support of the master plan and he felt the commercial development fit within the
recommendation of the master plan, but the master plan didn't recommend RE zoning, but rather
it recommended multiple family developments.

Mr. Graham said that was correct and that the Comprehensive Plan contained a zoning plan that
noted the differences between zoning classifications. He said the multiple family residential
didn't recommend high density, but rather it recommended multiple family residential with a
range of densities between 8 and 15 dwelling units per acre.

Mr. Clouse inquired if rezoning property along Marketplace Boulevard to RE to their rear



                                                                                                 33

property line, but also be permitted RE zoning along the east-west road to Broadbent with the
same depth, and leave the upper quadrant zoned RD, would be palatable and allow them to go
through the process to allow for the higher density and combine the two parcels together. He
noted that a site plan could be prepared that would allow them to increase the RE density to 15
dwelling units per acre and the RD density up to 11 dwelling units per acre. Mr. Clouse said they
would be agreeable to tabling their request this evening.

Mr. Schweitzer said he was in support of Mr. Lathrop's suggestion of step down zoning. Mr.
Schweitzer asked if there was anyone in the audience who would like to speak on this request.

Joan Cooper, 8240 W. St. Joe, noted that her property was located at the northwest corner of the
Marketplace/St. Joe Highway intersection. She noted that her property had approximately 165
feet of frontage along St. Joe and 650 feet of frontage along Marketplace Boulevard. Ms. Cooper
said she had submitted two letters to the Township and wanted to start this evening by stating her
strong objection to a step down zoning that would include high density apartments along
Marketplace Boulevard south of the retention pond. Ms. Cooper said one of the principal points
she had made in her letter was that St. Joe Highway was not now, and probably wouldn't be at
any time in the future, capable of handling the kind of traffic volumes high density residential
development would generate. She noted that St. Joe, between Marketplace and Canal, was a two
lane roadway with a two lane overpass over I-96 that didn't provide any means for safe
pedestrian crossing. Ms. Cooper said it was most likely that traffic generated from the high
density development would travel eastbound on St. Joe Highway in the morning which would be
the shortest and most direct route to their jobs in the morning. Ms. Cooper noted that if a step
down zoning was considered, she would like to see RC zoning on the southern half of the
proposed multi-family residential area and RD zoning at the north end of the area near the
retention pond.

Ms. Cooper said her first letter to the Township stated two points, the first point was that the
traffic assessment presented by the developer in favor of rezoning included insufficient data
regarding traffic density and traffic patterns on Marketplace, St. Joe and Saginaw Highway. She
said we have repeatedly heard from the developers and their representatives that traffic counts
were not possible until the zoning was in place, but she felt current traffic counts could be
obtained for Saginaw and St. Joe and that those traffic counts could be added to a probable traffic
count for the proposed multi-family residential area as presented in the traffic assessment. Ms.
Cooper felt data appeared to be skewed and in favor of the proposed high density development
and she used Page 10 of the Traffic Assessment as an example where it predicted a 35 mph speed
limit along Marketplace which was a four lane road, and allowing up to 1,700 cars per lane per
hour. However, she noted that Marketplace Boulevard was constructed with major curves at
three locations in order to slow traffic down. Ms. Cooper noted that there was a traffic signal
located at the St. Joe/ Marketplace Boulevard intersection that consisted of only three lanes. Ms.
Cooper said because traffic south of Marketplace would be slowed by the stop light and the



                                                                                                 34

narrowing of the road into three lanes, and because of traffic north on Marketplace was slowed
by the curves in the road and by stops at the Saginaw/Marketplace intersection, would not be able
to accommodate the 6,800 vehicle trips estimated at Page 10 of the Traffic Assessment.

Ms. Cooper felt the Traffic Assessment failed to allow for delivery vehicle trips, most of which
would travel northbound on Marketplace, but she occasionally saw delivery trucks using the St.
Joe/Marketplace intersection who had difficulty negotiating a turn onto St. Joe Highway. Ms.
Cooper noted that during evening hour rush hour traffic, vehicles traveling westbound on St. Joe,
west of Canal, could be backed up hundreds of feet, even east over the overpass since rush hour
traffic heading westbound on St. Joe included vehicles waiting to turn left onto Laurelwood,
Evergreen Heights, and Broadbent Woods. She said traffic was also traveling westbound
proceeding onto the subdivisions located west of Marketplace, as well as traffic that was
traveling northbound to utilize the existing commercial on Marketplace. Ms. Cooper said high
density development on the west side of Marketplace, and the discount club had been proposed,
but no one had mentioned the property on the east side of Marketplace which she understood was
recommended for office development. Ms. Cooper noted that traffic from the office and high
density development would either have to travel northbound to Saginaw, or southbound to St. Joe
which she felt would create a bottleneck at the St. Joe/Marketplace intersection. Ms. Cooper
noted that she had spoken to the Eaton County Road Commission and was informed that they
didn't have the funds, or the interest, of widening the I-96 overpass, nor was it a project that
MDOT would be undertaking.

Ms. Cooper said when traffic was traveling westbound on St. Joe from Canal to Marketplace, a
right turn lane existed for traffic at the intersection, but it only accommodated five vehicles. She
noted that if 15 to 25 vehicles were proposed at the intersection, stacking of vehicles would
extend to the east towards the I-96 overpass. Ms. Cooper said there were five homes located to
the east of the retention pond on either side of St. Joe and if traffic backed up, the driveways of
those homes would be blocked and that it would make it very difficult, given the limited sight
distance, for those homeowners to pull out of their driveways. She said developers may counter
that access to the three properties on Marketplace would also have an east-west access to
Broadbent. However, she countered those arguments by saying that most jobs were located to
the east and to the south of the Township which would have to be accessed via Canal or by St.
Joe to Creyts Road. Ms. Cooper said it would be logical for the tenants of the high density to
seek the most direct route to and from their jobs which would be Marketplace to St. Joe rather
than expect most of the tenants in the high density to use southbound Broadbent to St. Joe. Ms.
Cooper said for all of these reasons, she maintained that we additional traffic volumes and traffic
flow data must be obtained from Marketplace, St. Joe, and Saginaw Highway and she requested
that this request be tabled until a complete accurate set of data was made available to make a fact
based decision.

Ms. Cooper said the second point argued in her letter was that if evidence showed that traffic



                                                                                                  35

PAGE 11

volumes were too great for the current road system, which could not be modified in many cases
to accommodate the increased traffic volumes, then the development of the three properties along
Marketplace should be directed to planned development with lower densities and lower traffic
volumes. She felt we must be mindful that the rezoning request was just the beginning of
development of the entire area between the residential on St. Joe Highway and the residential to
the south and the commercial to the north on Saginaw Highway. Ms. Cooper said until there was
accurate traffic volume data provided for St. Joe, Marketplace, and Saginaw and traffic data for
the proposed office area on the east side of Marketplace, a fact based decision could not be made
regarding the proposed rezoning request.

Greg Leap, 8306 W. St. Joe Highway, said he didn't want to reiterate the traffic issues that Ms.
Cooper had addressed and that he felt she made some valid points. Mr. Leap said given that a
site plan had not been submitted, there wasn't a date when construction would commence, and
there wasn't any access to Broadbent Road and a traffic study, he questioned why it was
necessary to rezone the property at this time.

Kim Bates, 746 Laurelwood, said the purpose of the Zoning Ordinance was to control traffic and
even if the entire vacant property in the area was developed, there was already too much traffic at
the present time. She felt even if the property remained as is, traffic in the area was going to
increase and she didn't see any reason why more property needed to be rezoned to potentially
increase traffic more than what already existed.

Daniel Lipsy, 8628 Doe Pass, felt the proposed higher density development should front on
Broadbent rather than Marketplace which would force more traffic onto Broadbent and therefore
meet the traffic warrants for the installation of a signal at the Broadbent/Saginaw Highway
intersection. Mr. Lipsy said a majority of motorists would be seeking a route to the freeway and
that the proposed layout of the property would force more traffic onto Marketplace where there
was a potential for accidents to happen because of the limited sight distance created by the curves
in the road. Mr. Lipsy felt a big box user had predictable traffic patterns and as it had been stated
this evening, there were already bottlenecks at the Saginaw/Commercial Drive and Marketplace
intersections during peak traffic hours. He didn't feel those intersections were built to
accommodate increased commercial traffic, but rather smaller commercial uses would be easier
to accommodate. Mr. Lipsy said he understood that the applicant owned the property and wanted
some type of resolution, but he also felt consideration should be made to the inadequacies of
Marketplace and attempt to channel some of the traffic onto Broadbent if possible.

Dave Kennedy, 11498 Broadbent, said he had the same concerns that had been expressed this
evening by others. He noted that when the subject parcel first sold years ago, everybody viewed
it as progress and no one had any problems or concerns with the current layout, but now all of a
sudden, it was encroaching everywhere as far as traffic and he didn't want it in his backyard.




                                                                                                   36

Theresa Ross, 8551 Doe Pass inquired about spot zoning and comparing similar pieces of
property. She said residents were aware that the property would eventually be developed, but she
questioned at what point the traffic situation would be handled. Ms. Ross said she lived in
Broadbent Woods and used Laurelwood or Broadbent to access her subdivision. She indicated
that she had lived in the Township for 10 years and had spoken to the Road Commission
regarding the design of the St. Joe/Marketplace intersection and had asked them where else in the
Tri-County area was there an intersection where motorists used the same lane to go straight or
make a left turn. Ms. Ross said everybody was aware of the fact that St. Joe Highway was the
commercial backdoor to Marketplace and that Township residents wanted to shop and spend
their money in the Township, but residents also wanted to be able to get home at the end of the
day. Ms. Ross mentioned the fact that the traffic signal at the St. Joe/Marketplace intersection
started blinking at 9:00 p.m. and the holiday shopping rush had already started. However, she
noted that the new traffic signal at St. Joe and Broadbent was still working at 9:00 p.m.

Ms. Ross noted that traffic backups were currently experienced at the intersection and that she
had already witnessed three accidents this past week when the road conditions were slippery on
the I-96 overpass and she was rerouted through Walmart. Ms. Ross understood that the request
may be tabled this evening to the next Planning Commission meeting, but she would like to see
the request tabled until 2014 until all of the information was provided and an informed decision
could be made. She also asked that the residents in the surrounding neighborhoods be kept
informed about the status of the request.

Debra Fox, 225 Barrington Circle, said she wanted to address the proposed B-2 commercial area
and whether or not the Granger Group, the developers of Broadbent Condominiums, had been
advised of the proposed rezoning. Ms. Fox noted that the Broadbent Condos were not fully
developed and that development would take place around the one duplex that existed at the
southeast corner of the condo development. Ms. Fox asked that the Granger Group be notified of
the next meeting this item appeared on the agenda because it would affect the marketing of their
condominiums where the duplex was located. She pointed out that Broadbent Condos abutted a
forested area to the east, which would be rezoned to B2, commercial. She was concerned that a
parking lot may be developed which would remove the trees and would have an impact on
adjacent properties. Ms. Fox suggested that some type of sound barrier be installed along the
boundary between the condos and the proposed commercial area, as residents already
experienced noise from the existing commercial.

MOTION BY MCCONNELL, SECONDED BY GABRIEL, THAT THE PUBLIC
HEARING BE CLOSED. VOICE VOTE. CARRIED 9-0.

After checking the mailing list of property owners who received notice of the proposed rezoning
request, Mr. Graham stated that Mr. Granger was not notified of the public hearing and that he
would notify Mr. Granger tomorrow.



                                                                                                   37

Mr. Mudry said Ms. Cooper made mention of the speed limit on Marketplace Boulevard as being
35 mph and he wanted to let her know that at one time, he was told that since Marketplace
Boulevard had an unmarked speed limit, Marketplace was considered a County road and that the
speed limit was 55 mph. Mr. Mudry felt the 35 mph speed limit was much more favorable and
that a 55 mph speed limit was too high given the curves along Marketplace. Mr. Mudry assured
Ms. Fox that the Planning Commission would ensure that her concerns regarding a buffer
between Broadbent Condos and the proposed development would be highly considered during
site plan review. He indicated that he had received a letter from Gordon Harrier regarding the
strand of beautiful trees along Marketplace Boulevard north of the retention pond and that he
wanted to assure Mr. Harrier that he also felt those trees were very beautiful in the fall and that
he would be remiss if he didn't say that he would also miss those trees.

Mr. Graham said he wanted to state that Delta Township didn't have a tree preservation
ordinance and that the Township didn't have any way to make sure those trees were preserved.
He noted that the Commission could attempt to preserve the trees during site plan review.

MOTION BY LATHROP, SECONDED BY MACLAREN, THAT THE PLANNING
COMMISSION TABLE CASE NO. 10-13-18 IN ORDER IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE
APPLICANT TIME TO SUBMIT NEW INFORMATION REGARDING POSSIBLE
CHANGES IN THE ZONING REQUEST.

Mr. Graham felt the motion should table the request to a specific date. He didn't feel staff would
be able to come up with the scenarios the Commission was looking for in two weeks.

Mr. Clouse felt it was a matter of mathematical calculations which he felt they could provide
staff with in the next week to provide staff sufficient time before the next Planning Commission
meeting. He said that was the reason why they were agreeable to the idea of trying to work with
that zoning so that they kept this request moving. Mr. Clouse said they would like to keep their
request moving forward and that they have had this discussion since May and the idea of tabling
it and pushing into the next calendar year was not fair to the applicant. He said they would like
to keep it moving forward if possible.

A question was asked from the audience regarding the mathematical calculations Mr. Clouse had
referred to.

Mr. Clouse noted that the mathematical calculations would take into consideration discussion
that took place regarding the reconfiguration of the RD and RE zoning districts. Mr. Clouse felt
they could have amended legal descriptions provided to staff within seven days which would
allow staff to calculate the number of units per dwelling.

Mr. McConnell inquired about staff's timeline.



                                                                                                 38
SUMMARY RECORD OF PUBLIC HEARING

Mr. Graham felt staff would respond the best they could in two weeks. He said the other option
would be to table the request until the second meeting in December, but the Commission didn't
have a second meeting in December and that the request would have to be placed on the
Commission's November 25th agenda or the second Monday of December.

Mr. Lathrop amended his motion as follows:

MOTION BY LATHROP, SECONDED BY MACLAREN, THAT THE PLANNING
COMMISSION TABLE CASE NO. 10-13-18 UNTIL THE SECOND MONDAY OF
DECEMBER IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE APPLICANT TIME TO SUBMIT NEW
INFORMATION REGARDING POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE ZONING REQUEST.

Mr. McConnell questioned what type of information would be submitted as a result of the
tabling.

Mr. Graham said the applicant had indicated they would submit new information regarding
possible changes in the zoning request. He said staff would respond to what the applicant
submitted such as calculations of density and attempt to determine traffic counts on what would
be developed by acreage based on the ITE Manual. Mr. Graham said staff could not perform an
intersection analysis or determine the level of service.

Mr. McConnell wanted to make clear what the Commission would be looking at when this
request was back before them.

Mr. Graham felt the Commission would be looking at acreages, dwelling units, and very
preliminary traffic information on what could be generated on the property, but as far as the
impact on the intersections, staff would not be able to provide that information.

Ms. Laforet questioned if traffic patterns on Marketplace were only 3% utilized at the present
time and if that was the case, the increased traffic of 12,000 trips in a 24-hour period would be
based on the rezoning as submitted.

Mr. Gruba noted that the 12,000 trips a day would be the traffic count if the rezoning was
approved as submitted. He said the 3% that Ms. Laforet had referred to was contained in the
traffic assessment.

Mr. Sonnenberg said as part of the traffic assessment, they were asked to attempt to guesstimate
what the capacity of Marketplace was today compared to if the rezoning was approved. He said
the 3% was during the morning peak hour and it was 8% utilized during the evening peak hour.
Mr. Sonnenberg said if the rezoning was approved, the worst case scenario, Marketplace would



                                                                                                    39
SUMMARY RECORD OF PUBLIC HEARING
CASE NO. 10-13-18
NOVEMBER 11, 2013
PAGE 15

be at 13% capacity in the a.m. and 27% in the p.m. He said Marketplace was a four lane
roadway that still had more capacity.

Ms. Laforet asked if the percentages took into account the east-west collector road.

Mr. Sonnenberg said his figures did not take into consideration an east-west collector road due to
the fact that the traffic assessment was prepared for a rezoning request and was not a traffic study
prepared for a site plan. He said a traffic study would be done once they had a specific site plan
from the developer.

Ms. Laforet asked if part of the site plan review would include an east-west collector road to
Broadbent that would reduce the maximum traffic count on Marketplace Boulevard.

Ms. Sonnenberg said the traffic impact study would take into consideration an east-west collector
road if it was part of the site plan.

Ms. Laforet said since all the Planning Commission would be looking at was a reconfiguration of
what the developer had requested this evening, she questioned whether there was any reason to
prolong the request until the Commission's meeting in December. Ms. Laforet noted that the
Commission already was aware that the worst case scenario would be 12,000 trips generated a
day which wasn't going to change. She felt Ms. Ross could act as a representative for her
neighbors and keep them informed of the status of the rezoning request and let them know that
they were welcome to submit comments. Ms. Laforet didn't feel this needed to be delayed any
longer and that staff wouldn't be able to provide any more answers than what they already had
this evening due to the fact that staff wouldn't be able to conduct a traffic or intersection analysis.

Mr. Graham didn't feel the Commission should look at the 12,000 vehicles trips per day, but
rather they should focus on the a.m. and p.m. peak traffic volumes. He said typically the a.m.
and p.m. peak traffic hours are 10% of the total traffic during the day. Mr. Graham said the
Commission should also focus on the level of service at the intersections, but the Commission
had to have numbers.

Ms. Laforet asked if an amendment should be made to the motion for tabling because at the
present time, the Commission is just guessing.

Mr. Graham said if the Commission was going to analyze the intersections, they should be
analyzed tomorrow because in another week or two, the numbers would be skewed due to
holiday traffic.

Ms. Laforet asked if there were any missing pieces of the puzzle that the Commission would
need that the Commission wouldn't be receiving in a week's time that was needed to make an



                                                                                                     40

informed decision.

Mr. Graham didn't feel the Commission would be receiving levels of service at the intersection.

Mr. Sonnenberg said it would be a minimum of three weeks for his crews to conduct field counts
and complete a full traffic impact study.

Mr. Clouse said the problem he was having was that it was not a Township standard to have a
traffic impact study for rezonings, but rather it was a standard for special land use permit requests
or site plan reviews. He said to go through and spend significant time and money over something
that was completely guess work was a waste of the applicant's time and was something that the
Township had not done before. Mr. Clouse felt they had followed the Township's procedure
which was to go through the master plan amendment process, a rezoning, and then submit a site
plan at which time a full traffic impact study would be completed. He felt they had supplied the
information that was required under the Zoning Ordinance for rezoning requests. Mr. Clouse
noted that he didn't have a problem with tabling the request until December, but he didn't feel
delaying the request any further was appropriate.

Mr. Lathrop said he wasn't recommending tabling the request in order to delay it, but rather he
was proposing that the Commission take more time to make an informed decision.

Ms. Gabriel supported what Ms. Laforet had stated about the timing on this request and that she
didn't feel the Commission would be provided with any more valuable information in four weeks
versus two and she felt this request should be placed on the next available agenda. Ms. Gabriel
felt the Commission could analyze the information that was provided to them and at that point,
either support or deny the request. She didn't feel the Commission would be any smarter in four
weeks than they would be in two weeks.

Mr. Sonnenberg said the problem he had with the traffic study the Commission was asking for
was that it would be the same as the Commission had to approve a site plan based on a square
box being put on a piece of property without any detail. He said the amount of traffic was based
on square footage and that units per acre didn't take into consideration green space and parking
lots. Mr. Sonnenberg said until he had that information, he couldn't provide the kind of traffic
study the Commission was looking for.

Ms. Laforet said during her tenure on the Commission, she had never been asked to approve a
rezoning without something specific in mind and being able to look at the whole picture.
However, she appreciated the applicant's position.

    1. Case No. 10-13-18, Rezoning Request for 63.46 acres of land on the east
       side of Marketplace Boulevard, midway between Saginaw Highway and
       St. Joe Highway, Section 16, Applicant is Eyde Construction Company.
       (This case was tabled at the November 11, 2013 Planning Commission
       meeting).

       Assistant Planner Chris Gruba said this proposal was reviewed by the
       Planning Commission on November 11, 2013 which consisted of 63 acres on
       the west side of Marketplace Boulevard, between St. Joe and Saginaw
       Highway. He said at that time, the Commission tabled the request due to
       concerns that were raised by residents and the Planning Commission
       regarding the high densities allowed in the requested RE, High Density
       Residential, zoning district. Mr. Gruba said the request reviewed at the
       November 11th meeting involved rezoning RB, Low Density Residential and
       RC, Moderate Density Residential, to a B2, Community Commercial and RE,
       High Density Residential, zoning classification. He noted that there was very
       little discussion regarding the B2 rezoning other than concerns raised
       regarding buffering the proposed commercial area from the existing
       residential development to the west.

       Mr. Gruba noted that in response to the concerns expressed at the
       Commission's November 11th meeting, the applicant's Land Planner, Dick
       Cooley, submitted a revised rezoning proposal that rezoned the northwest 8.43
       acres to RD and the remaining 25.47 acres to RE. He noted that most of the
       retention pond area would be rezoned RE, but the area could not be counted
       towards density for the remainder of the property. Mr. Gruba noted that the
       revised plan would consist of rezoning 21.76 acres north of the retention pond
       to B2, Community Commercial. He indicated that staff prepared a table that
       provided an estimate of the maximum dwelling units that would be allowed
       per acre and projected traffic generation for four different rezoning scenarios.
       He noted that staff used the Institution of Transportation Engineers (ITE) 9th
       addition when estimating traffic generation data.

       Mr. Lathrop questioned if the number of dwelling units provided by staff were
       allowed "by-right".

       Mr. Gruba said staff's estimates were dwelling units allowed "by-right" and
       that the number of units could be higher if the applicant requested a PUD.
       Mr. Gruba reviewed the new supplemental information the Commission had
       been provided with and the fact that staff had received six letters in opposition
       to the rezoning request since the November 11th meeting. Mr. Gruba noted
       that the Township's Comprehensive Plan recommended an east-west
       connector between Marketplace Boulevard and Broadbent, but the connector
       road would be addressed in more detail by the Commission during site plan
       review. He noted that staff had recommended that the Commission make a



                                                                                           44
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF

       recommendation on the original proposal first to rezone property south of the
       retention pond to an RE zoning classification before moving on and taking
       action on the alternative zoning scenario.

       Mr. Mudry asked if the Commission would be acting on the B2 zoning request
       first.

       Mr. Gruba said that was correct.

       Mark Clouse, representing the Eyde Company, felt it was important to recall
       the staff report the Commission had received at their November 11th meeting
       and the fact that nothing had changed since that time other than the
       Commission now had additional material to consider. He said the staff report
       recommended approval of the requested rezoning which included B2 and RE
       zoning classifications. Mr. Clouse noted that staff had provided the
       Commission with zoning alternatives for their consideration in response to
       discussion that took place at the November 11th meeting. He noted that they
       had also presented an alternative that reduced the RE zoning portion of their
       request by approximately nine acres and proposed RD zoning instead. Mr.
       Clouse noted that by doing this, the RE portion of their request was kept along
       Marketplace Boulevard and the RD portion of their request would be near the
       proposed east-west connector road to Broadbent. Mr. Clouse noted that the
       Eyde Company was in favor of providing an east-west connector road, but he
       didn't feel it was appropriate to consider the road at this time. Mr. Clouse
       indicated that they had spoken to staff earlier today about providing an
       easement for the road, but it wouldn't make sense to do so at this time since
       they didn't know where the road should be located within the development.
       He noted that the location of the road would be based on visibility
       requirements and the pattern of the roads.

       Mr. Clouse felt it was important to note that what they were proposing this
       evening was what the Future Land Use Map recommended that was adopted
       in January of 2013. He stated that the staff report read that the
       Comprehensive Plan was adopted by the Planning Commission and that the
       Future Land Use Map included the land use changes as generally proposed by
       Consultant Dick Cooley. Therefore, the proposed rezoning of the subject
       parcels matched the future land use recommendations in the 2013
       Comprehensive Plan. Mr. Clouse said during the Township's review of the
       Comprehensive Plan, the Eyde Company met with Planning Consultants who
       assisted the Township with the review regarding the land use pattern and that
       the consultants had made a recommendation to staff who then made a
       recommendation to the Planning Commission for approval.

       Mr. Clouse said comments were made at the November 9th meeting that a site
       plan should have been submitted with the rezoning request, however, he



                                                                                         45
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF

       pointed out that a site plan was not required during the rezoning process. He
       noted that the Township had elected not to allow contract zoning, but to
       follow its master plan. He felt they had submitted a rezoning request that
       complied with the Township's master plan and once the rezoning was in
       place, they would prepare a site plan for the Commission's review, as well as
       a complete traffic impact analysis. Mr. Clouse pointed out that the requested
       RE zoning would allow them to build an apartment complex with amenities
       they would like to bring to the community and if the property was developed
       with a lower density, the community would end up with a less than desirable
       amenity package for the residents of the apartment complex.

       Ms. Gabriel said Mr. Clouse had referred to the recommendations of the
       Comprehensive Plan, but the Plan referred to multiple family development
       and that the Plan didn't recommend RE or RD zoning classifications.

       Mr. Clouse said the most recent proposal of ¼ RD and ¾ RE is intended for
       higher density residential development and the existing RB zoning would
       serve as a transition area to the existing single family residential to the west
       and south. Mr. Clouse noted that when the Comprehensive Plan was updated,
       it was suggested that the Township adopt a zoning district that would allow
       for uses in between the single family/duplex zoning districts and high density
       residential development.

       Ms. Gabriel questioned if the residential portion of the development would be
       a mixed use.

       Mr. Clouse said they had suggested a zoning that would allow five dwelling
       units per acre by-right. He agreed that the RD or RE zoning districts would
       allow multiple family developments, however, they had asked for RE zoning,
       but he felt both fit within the category.

       Ms. Gabriel said the point she wanted to make was that the Comprehensive
       Plan referred to multiple family and that the Plan didn't recommended RD or
       RE zoning classifications.

       Mr. Clouse said it was his intention to suggest that their rezoning request for
       RD or RE zoning followed the recommendations of the Township's master
       plan and that the RC zoning did not follow the Plan's recommendation
       because it didn't allow multiple family development.

       Mr. Gruba noted that the Commission had been provided with an alternative
       plan from resident Joan Cooper which presented a step down approach.

       Mr. Clouse said the RC zoning classification did not allow multiple family
       developments without a special land use permit and therefore, it did not



                                                                                          46
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF

       follow the master plan. He noted that the RC zoning was intended for single
       family and not multiple family development.

       Mr. Schweitzer asked if there was anyone who would like to speak on this
       request.

       Joan Cooper, 8240 W. St. Joe, northwest corner of the Marketplace/St. Joe
       Highway intersection, noted that at the November 11, 2013 Planning
       Commission meeting, she had spoken against the proposed rezoning on
       Marketplace that would allow RE, High Density Residential development on
       the west side of Marketplace Boulevard. Ms. Cooper said her argument for
       opposing an RE, High Density Residential, zoning classification for the area
       was based on two factors, the first being the incompatibility with existing
       residential construction to the south and the second reason was the lack of
       road capacity on Saginaw Highway to the north and St. Joe Highway to the
       south, to handle the peak vehicle trips that would be generated on the 34 acre
       subject parcel. Ms. Cooper said an RE zoning classification would allow 375
       to 512 dwelling units, as well as a big box retailer. She said significant road
       capacity factors, not considered by petitioning property owners, included
       traffic counts for peak hours at the Marketplace/Saginaw and Marketplace/St.
       Joe intersections.

       Ms. Cooper said after the November 11th meeting, she wrote a letter to the
       Planning Commission suggesting that they require the petitioning property
       owners to supply traffic count data. Ms. Cooper noted that she had called the
       Eaton County Road Commission and obtained copies of traffic counts for the
       Marketplace/St. Joe intersection at peak hours and that she didn't believe the
       Planning Commission had traffic counts for the Marketplace/Saginaw
       intersection. Ms. Cooper also reminded the Planning Commission of the large
       area located on the east side of Marketplace Boulevard currently designated
       for office development which didn't have access onto St. Joe or Saginaw
       Highway. Ms. Cooper said she also remarked on the limited capacity of St.
       Joe Highway to handle traffic exiting Marketplace due to the two lane
       overpass on St. Joe Highway. She said due to the traffic overload on the
       existing intersection, and due to the incompatibility of high density residential
       development, with low density residential development currently in place
       directly south of the 34 acre parcel proposed for high density residential, she
       strongly opposed both the RE and the RD zoning requests.

       Ms. Cooper said in staff's December 3rd staff report prepared for this request,
       an RD rezoning alternative had been submitted by staff to the Planning
       Commission. She said before the Planning Commission considered and voted
       on the RD alternative, she would like to speak to the Commission about the
       Delta Township legacy that had been in place for the 30+ years she had lived
       in the Township and which Mark Graham, and previous Planning



                                                                                           47
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF

       Commissions, Township Boards, and supervisor's, had established to buffer
       and protect Delta Township homeowners. Ms. Cooper said it had always been
       the policy of Delta to hold to a Comprehensive Plan that separated low density
       residential from commercial, industrial, and high density residential
       development. Ms. Cooper said for years, as rezoning requests had been
       submitted, we had been reminded of the step down development philosophy
       that protected low density residential from encroachment by high density
       residential, commercial, and industrial development. Ms. Cooper said she
       would maintain that the placement of RD zoning immediately adjacent to RB,
       Low Density Residential, was not compatible with the step down planning
       philosophy that had been in place in Delta Township for several years. She
       said as suggested by the Planning Department staff, the Commission voted to
       recommend RD zoning for the entire 34 acre parcel on the west side of
       Marketplace Boulevard, the following undesirable consequences could be
       predicted:

       1. The area to the south and west of the 34 acre subject parcel would be less
          desirable for single family home construction. For lack of demand for
          single family homes in areas now designated for RB, and RA zoning,
          these areas might eventually need to be rezoned for multiple family
          development.

       2. RD zoning resulted in a higher traffic density in an area not compatible
          with high traffic volumes.

       Ms. Cooper noted that because she regarded both RE and RD zoning as
       undesirable with possible strong negative impacts on the existing community,
       she suggested a compromise alternative, one that could protect the current
       residential neighborhoods. A compromise that would have a less serious
       impact on the roads and intersections, a compromise she believed was
       compatible with the long standing commitment that Delta Township had for a
       step down zoning plan that protected the current low density residential
       development and provided a true neighborhood feeling to any new
       development that came to the 74 acres in question. Ms. Cooper noted that she
       had proposed a neighborhood that transitioned from the current RA
       development along the north side of St. Joe Highway, to the current
       undeveloped area currently designated for RB, Low Density Residential,
       which was currently 400 feet south and north along Marketplace Boulevard
       and directly in back of her property, with a buffer 300 feet wide which she felt
       was a reasonable buffer between medium density residential development.

       Ms. Cooper noted that the entire southernmost edge of the 42 acres which had
       been proposed for reconsideration, and the entire westernmost edge of the 34
       acres, would be zoned RC. Ms. Cooper said the need for an east-west road
       connecting Marketplace Boulevard to Broadbent had already been



                                                                                          48
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF

       demonstrated and that the future road could be situated to provide a buffer
       between the low and high density residential. She felt it would also be
       possible, during site plan review, for the areas zoned RB and RC to designate
       principle road access into the RB and RC areas from that east-west road rather
       than directly onto Marketplace Boulevard which would direct more traffic to
       the Saginaw/Broadbent Road intersection instead of the Marketplace/St. Joe
       intersection which currently experienced traffic problems due to the two lane
       overpass on St. Joe Highway. Ms. Cooper also felt that an RC buffer would
       make the current RB area more desirable for a higher quality home in a
       protected interior neighborhood. Ms. Cooper strongly urged the Commission
       to deny a large area of RD or RE zoning directly next to an RB, Low Density
       Residential area. She felt a buffer of RC zoning, or condominium housing,
       would be consistent with the current Comprehensive Plan and that it would be
       consistent with the long standing step down zoning philosophy of Delta
       Township and protect current residents from the encroachment of undesirable
       and incompatible development.

       Tim Sport, representing Broadbent Condominiums and the Granger Group
       who was the developer of the Barrington Woods Condo Association located
       directly west of the subject parcel, felt the proposal for additional commercial
       development would have a significant negative impact on their ability to
       complete their development due to the damage it would cause to the existing
       property owner's property values and to future planned and approved units on
       their site. Mr. Sport said they would like to encourage the Planning
       Commission to deny the rezoning, but if the rezoning was approved, they
       would like to see restrictions put in place for greater setbacks and additional
       green space that would buffer the current condominium homeowners.

       MOTION BY MUDRY, SECONDED BY MCCONNELL, THAT THE
       PUBLIC HEARING BE CLOSED. VOICE VOTE. CARRIED 7-0.

       Mr. Lathrop said he understood Mr. Sport's concerns with the proposed
       rezoning request and he questioned if the Granger Group had any specific
       proposals they would like considered.

       Mr. Sport suggested that an easement be put in place that would provide
       Barrington Woods with additional buffering. He noted that they owned the
       unbuildable retention pond that was located in the northeast corner of the
       Barrington Woods development, which protected their development from the
       existing commercial, but they had significant concerns with future commercial
       development that could take place adjacent to their property. Mr. Sport felt
       increased setbacks and additional landscaping would help buffer the current
       homeowners in Barrington Woods.

       Mr. Lathrop inquired about the easement Mr. Sport had referred to.



                                                                                          49
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF
DECEMBER 9, 2013, PAGE 8


       Mr. Sport said at the present time, development could take place within 30
       feet of their property line which was why they wanted something put in place
       that would provide the current homeowners and future residents additional
       protection. Mr. Sport noted that based on the property they had purchased to
       the northeast that provided them with additional buffering, he suggested that a
       200 to 250 foot wide easement be put in place.

       Ms. Gabriel questioned what type of setback would be required between
       Barrington Woods and the proposed development.

       Mr. Bozek said safeguards were built into the Zoning Ordinance at the time of
       site plan review and that a 30 foot wide buffer strip was required between
       commercial and residentially zoned land. He noted that additional setbacks
       were also required and that no building could be located within 40 feet of the
       common property line. However, Mr. Bozek pointed out that the
       Commission, or the Township Board, did not have the ability to attach
       conditions to a rezoning.

       Ms. Gabriel asked if the setback would be approximately 70 feet from the
       common lot line.

       Mr. Bozek said there would be 30 feet of green space and an additional 10 feet
       where a building could be placed.

       Ms. Gabriel inquired about the unbuildable property the Granger Group had
       purchased.

       Mr. Sport noted that they owned the unbuildable property to the northeast. He
       said a portion of the property was used for storm water detention, as well as
       additional buffering. Mr. Sport said they were concerned with the prospect of
       commercial development taking place within 40 feet of planned and approved
       dwelling units which he felt would significantly impact their ability to
       complete Barrington Woods in a way that was favorable to current
       homeowners.

       Ms. Gabriel asked Mr. Sport if it was their intention to build condominium
       units west of the proposed B2 commercial parcel.

       Mr. Sport said units could be developed along either side of Barrington Drive,
       which consisted of 90 units. He reiterated the fact that they owned the
       property to the northeast that would protect the units on that side of the road.

       Ms. Gabriel felt the Commission should discuss whether or not to approve or
       deny the first proposal.




                                                                                          50

       Mr. Bozek said the Planning Commission could act on the commercial
       rezoning request first and then they could act on the residential rezoning
       request. He noted that depending on the Commission's actions, they had
       alternatives to consider for the residential rezoning request.

          a.      THE AREA IN QUESTION POSSESSES PHYSICAL
                  FEATURES COMPATIBLE WITH THE PROPOSED
                  ZONING DISTRICT DUE TO THE EXISTENCE OF A 7+
                  ACRE DETENTION POND ON THE NORTHERN

       2. THE PROPOSED RD ZONING DISTRICT WILL CONFORM TO
          THE GOALS & POLICIES IN THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
          AND SECTION 1.2.0, PURPOSE, OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE
          AS FOLLOWS:

          a. THE FUTURE LAND USE MAP IN THE DELTA TOWNSHIP
             COMPREHENSIVE PLAN RECOMMENDS MULTIPLE
             FAMILY RESIDENTIAL LAND USES ON THE SUBJECT
             PARCEL.

          b. THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE VICINITY OF THE
             SUBJECT PARCEL IS ADEQUATE TO SERVE THE
             MULTIPLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL USES PERMITTED IN
             THE RD ZONING DISTRICT AS FOLLOWS: 16" WATER
             MAIN AND A 12" SANITARY SEWER ARE LOCATED
             WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE BOULEVARD RIGHT OF
             WAY, THE LAZELL DRAIN SERVES THE PROPERTY,
             MARKETPLACE BOULEVARD HAS FIVE LANES
             ADJACENT TO THE SUBJECT PARCEL, THERE ARE
             TRAFFIC SIGNALS AT THE MARKETPLACE/WEST
             SAGINAW AND MARKETPLACE/ST. JOE INTERSECTIONS,
             THE M-43/I-96 INTERCHANGE IS LOCATED
             APPROXIMATELY A HALF MILE FROM THE PROPERTY,
             AND THERE ARE SIDEWALKS ALONG THE MAJORITY OF
             THE MARKETPLACE BOULEVARD FRONTAGE.

          c. THE LANDSCAPING AND BUILDING SETBACK
             REQUIREMENTS OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE, AS WELL
             AS SITE PLAN REVIEW BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION,
             CAN INSURE COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE FUTURE
             LOWER DENSITY RESIDENTIAL LAND USES TO THE
             SOUTH AND WEST AND THE COMMERCIAL LAND USES
             TO THE NORTH.

       Mr. Schweitzer questioned if the motion would limit the developer to a total
       of 272 dwelling units.



                                                                                      54
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF
DECEMBER 9, 2013, PAGE 13


       Mr. Bozek said the developer would be permitted 272 dwelling units by-right,
       but the developer could apply for a special land use permit that would allow
       11 dwelling units per acre and a PUD would allow a maximum of 15 dwelling
       units per acre.

       Mr. Lathrop said his preference would be to split the property between RD
       and RE. He asked if the makers of the motion would be amendable to him
       making a motion to that effect and if the motion was denied, then the
       Commission could move on to the motion on the floor.

       Ms. Gabriel said she was concerned about splitting the parcel due to traffic
       volumes. Ms. Gabriel noted that RD zoning versus RE zoning would be
       approximately 650 less cars per day. Ms. Gabriel noted that she traveled
       through the area that was being proposed this weekend and the traffic was
       terrible. She understand that the traffic volumes were not during peak traffic
       times, but she felt the 600 vehicle trips per day was significant which was why
       she was in favor of the RD zoning classification.

       Mr. Mudry agreed with Ms. Gabriel and that he had traveled the area last
       weekend and it was gridlocked. He understood that it was during the
       Holidays, but he also looked at the occupancy chart for Delta and what was
       available for development and it looked like the apartments in the Township
       were maxed out and that this type of housing needed to be available to
       residents and future residents of the Township. Mr. Mudry asked himself how
       he could be caught in gridlock and still need apartments available to our
       residents, but he felt the RD compromise was the way to go. Mr. Mudry
       realized some of the limitations of this decision and he hoped things worked
       out for the best, but that is why he came up with the RD compromise.

       Ms. Ruswinckel asked what time Mr. Mudry was in the area this past
       weekend.

       Mr. Mudry said he traveled the area on Sunday at noon.

       Ms. Gabriel asked Mr. Schweitzer to speak on the properties within the
       Township that were available for RE development.

       Mr. Schweitzer referred to the properties located in Section 15 and Section 18
       by noting that although there weren't any specific development proposals at
       this time, those properties would be much more commendable as far as traffic
       congestion was concerned than the subject parcel.

       ROLL CALL VOTE. MOTION FAILED 4-3 (CASCARILLA,
       LATHROP, SCHWEITZER) FOR LACK OF MAJORITY VOTE.




                                                                                         55
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF
DECEMBER 9, 2013, PAGE 14


       Mr. Bozek said the Planning Commission's By-Laws state that for a motion to
       pass, a majority of the total membership of the Commission was needed. He
       said if another motion wasn't made, the request would go before the
       Township Board without a specific recommendation.

       Mr. Lathrop noted that he was in favor of making a motion that would extend
       the RE zoning to the southern boundary of the subject parcel. It was noted
       that the western half of the 42 acre parcel would be zoned RD and the eastern
       half of the parcel along Marketplace Boulevard would be zoned RE.

       Mr. Gruba pointed out that with this type of split zoning, it was not to say that
       it would be less dense on the west than it would be on the east and that the
       density would be averaged across the entire property.

       Mr. Clouse felt this was assuming that they were developing a PUD. He said
       if they chose to develop the eastern portion of the property in the RE category,
       they would be permitted 11 dwelling units per acre and that the RD zoning
       would permit 8 dwelling units by-right. Mr. Clouse noted that if the property
       was developed by-right, there would be a difference in density between the
       two parcels. He said to assume that they would develop a PUD was an
       incorrect assumption, although if density was decreased, the lower density
       would be closest to Broadbent Road.

       MOTION BY LATHROP, SECONDED BY MCCONNELL, THAT THE
       DELTA TOWNSHIP PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMEND TO
       THE DELTA TOWNSHIP BOARD APPROVAL OF THE REQUEST
       TO REZONE AN AREA OF APPROXIMATELY THAT THE DELTA

       ROLL CALL VOTE. MOTION FAILED 4-3 (GABRIEL, MUDRY,
       SCHWEITZER) FOR LACK OF MAJORITY VOTE.



                                                              57
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF

       Ms. Gabriel said she would like the minutes to reflect that her major concern
       with the rezoning request was the number of dwelling units and the number of
       cars that would access out onto Marketplace Boulevard and the impact on the
       intersections. Ms. Gabriel noted that she wasn't against multiple family
       developments, but she was very concerned about the density of traffic that
       would be generated and the fact that public transportation wasn't available to
       serve the residents who may live in the area.

       Mr. Clouse said the fact that public transportation wasn't available was a
       concern of theirs as well and that he hoped the Township would be able to
       work with CATA in providing public transportation in the future. Mr. Clouse
       felt one of the positive things about the subject parcel was the fact that the
       residents who lived in the area would have the capability of walking to nearby
       shopping. Mr. Clouse said he appreciated the traffic concerns and that the
       numbers they had been working with assumed that they knew how the
       property would be developed. However, he noted that they didn't know how
       the property would be laid out until it was developed. He said when a site
       plan came before the Commission, a complete traffic study would be provided
       that would help the Commission make a decision. Mr. Clouse said he would
       like a recommendation forwarded to the Township Board to approve the split
       zoning knowing that it would come back before the Commission for further
       review during site plan review.

       Debra Fox, 225 Barrington Circle, said she was somewhat confused and she
       questioned whether the commercial portion of the request this evening had
       been approved.

       Mr. Schweitzer informed Ms. Fox that the commercial rezoning request had
       been recommended for approval.

       Mr. Bozek informed the Commission that they had the option of tabling the
       request this evening until a full membership of the Commission could be
       present to reconsider the motions that failed for lack of a majority vote this
       evening.

       Mr. Mudry said he would like to move this request forward, but he felt it was
       important to reconsider the request when a full body of the Commission could
       be present.

       Mr. Lathrop agreed with Mr. Mudry that the request should be tabled until a
       full membership of the Commission could be present.

       Ms. Ruswinckel questioned if the applicant was in agreement with tabling the
       request until the Commission's first meeting in January.




                                                                                        58

       Mr. Clouse agreed to table the request until a full membership of the
       Commission could be present so that a recommendation could be passed on to
       the Township Board. However, he noted that he wasn't sure of his
       availability at the Commission's January 13, 2014 meeting due to another
       meeting commitment.

       MOTION BY RUSWINCKEL, SECONDED BY LATHRUP, THAT
       CASE NO. 10-13-18 BE POSTPONED.

       Mr. Gruba asked if the Commission wanted to entertain the option of having
       the residential property be rezoned to ¼ RE and ¾ RD, as this seemed to be a
       compromise to the first two failed motions.

       Mr. Bozek said at first there was a large reduction from the RE and RD zoning
       in terms of density and then there was the alternative for a split of the RE and
       RD zoning and now if the Commission went ¾ split , they would increase the
       density between half and higher.

       Mr. Clouse felt the Commission had heard public comment on all RE or RD
       and had heard everybody's concerns, but if you were to change the current
       plan, the Commission would probably be putting them in a position where
       they would need to request a PUD to make it work because to try to develop
       the higher density in one quadrant probably would not be the most desirable
       thing to do. Mr. Clouse felt the other idea would be to estimate where the line
       would be and drawn along Marketplace Boulevard as Mr. Gruba had
       suggested. Mr. Clouse said he would like to move the request along with a
       recommendation, but it was the Commission's call as to whether there was
       enough support to do so. He was concerned delaying the request further into
       January and not knowing whether a full body of the Commission would be
       present.

       Mr. Schweitzer questioned if Mr. Gruba was requesting 8.43 acres as RE.

       Mr. Gruba stated that Mr. Schweitzer was correct, the RE area would be 8.43
       acres and the RD would be 25.74 acres.

       Mr. Clouse said as long as the 8.43 acres didn't include the pond, they could
       work with it.

       Ms. Gabriel said if the Commission were to come up with a suggestion other
       than the two or three that had been discussed, she questioned if the public
       hearing would have to be opened up for comment.

       Mr. Bozek said he was aware of the fact that the applicant would like to move
       forward, but he wanted to allow staff time to lay it out and prepare an analysis



                                                                                          59

          on density and present it to the Commission with a motion similar to what had
          been done with the other alternatives.

          The Commission was in favor of Mr. Bozek's recommendation.

XI     PLANNING DIRECTOR COMMENTS

       Community Development Director Mark Graham said he had attended the
       Township Board Committee of the Whole meeting this evening where discussion
       took place on several items such as the regulation of tents along the West Saginaw
       Highway corridor, possible regulation of blood plasma centers, and minor
       amendments to the Sign Ordinance. Mr. Graham provided the Commission with
       an update on the lawsuit filed by Kelly Johnson against the Township who had
       requested a dog grooming business in the Mar Moor subdivision that was denied
       by the Township Board. Mr. Graham wished the Commission "Happy Holidays".

VIII   OLD BUSINESS

       1. Case No. 10-13-18, Rezoning Request for 63.46 acres of land on the west
          side of Marketplace Boulevard, midway between Saginaw Highway and
          St. Joe Highway, Section 16, Applicant is Eyde Construction Company.
          (This case was tabled at the December 9, 2013 Planning Commission
          meeting).

          Assistant Planner Chris Gruba informed the Commission that the Eyde
          proposal was reviewed by the Planning Commission at their November 11th
          and their December 9, 2013 meetings. Mr. Gruba proceeded to provide the
          Commission with a brief overview of the changes that had been made to the
          rezoning request in regards to acreage and density.

          Mark Clouse, representing the Eyde Company, said they were hopeful that the
          Commission felt comfortable with the proposed changes and that a
          recommendation for approval could be forwarded to the Township Board.

          Joan Cooper, 8240 W. St. Joe, northwest corner of the Marketplace/St. Joe
          Highway intersection, said she spoke in opposition to the rezoning request in
          Case No. 10-13-18 which proposed a high density apartment complex on 41.7
          acres located on the west side of Marketplace Boulevard. She noted that at
          the November 11, 2013 meeting, and at the previous Planning Commission
          meeting, and in letters addressed to the Planning Commission, she argued
          against RE, High Density Residential development for the 41.7 acres based on
          restricted road access to the 41 acres which was a two-lane bridge on St. Joe
          Highway to the east, unknown traffic volumes at the Marketplace
          intersections of Saginaw and West St. Joe Highway, and the restricted access
          to the undeveloped land directly east to the proposed apartment complex
          across Marketplace Boulevard that was undeveloped land designated for
          office, but which was accessible only at the same location on Marketplace
          where the proposed apartment development would exit onto Marketplace.
          Ms. Cooper noted that RD and RE zoning at the proposed 41.7 acres on
          Marketplace Boulevard would generate traffic congestion at the Saginaw and
          St. Joe Highway intersections that would be hazardous and unavoidable. She
          said a further complication to the traffic congestion problem occurred this
          month after the ice storm power outage that occurred early Sunday morning,
          December 22nd thru late Saturday afternoon, December 28th. She noted that
          the St. Joe intersection had no street light, stop light, or stop sign. Ms. Cooper
          said in a week-long emergency, cars sped through the intersection without
          stopping and some cars missed the intersection in the dark. When she called
          the Road Commission and the Sheriff's Department to request a blinking




                                                                                               63

       safety barrel and a temporary stop sign, she was led to believe that nothing
       could be done to improve traffic safety.

       Ms. Cooper said it wasn't the Board of Water & Light's top priority to fix
       traffic signals at dangerous intersections and if the intersection hazards were
       ignored by the Sheriff's Department and Road Commission, what would
       happen if traffic from 375 to 512 apartment units was added to the hazardous
       situation. Ms. Cooper noted that we simply didn't have adequate roads at the
       Marketplace location to handle the thousands of extra vehicle trips that would
       be generated by RE and RD zoning on Marketplace Boulevard. Ms. Cooper
       reminded the Commission of other important factors that argued against the
       piecemeal approach that had so far been taken on the 41.7 acres west of
       Marketplace. She noted that several years ago, a proposal for a health
       complex, similar to the one located on Hagadorn in East Lansing, failed when
       the economy failed. Ms. Cooper noted that a child care center was also
       proposed on the west side of Marketplace Boulevard, but the Township Board
       moved to located the child care center within the office zoning located on the
       east side of Marketplace Boulevard. Ms. Cooper said no attention seemed to
       be given to a detailed comprehensive plan by the property owners for
       construction that was appropriate to adjacent construction that promoted
       compatibility with nearby usage that worked with community and government
       to promote a functional, attractive place to live and work. Ms. Cooper
       questioned how high density apartments could be built when there were no
       bus services available, where utility companies placed service at low priority,
       where road access was a problem, where placement of apartments next to
       areas now designated low density residential, may not appeal to future
       homebuilders and buyers.

       Ms. Cooper said there were two types of developers, one type had very
       specific goals for the type of community he or she wanted to create and how it
       would fit in with the bigger picture of the city or township it was part of. She
       said the property owners who wanted apartments on their 41.7 acres next to
       Marketplace Boulevard were not promoting such a vision. Ms. Cooper said
       the developer's in Case No. 10-13-18 didn't appear to be interested in long-
       term goals, or how their development would be appropriate for the rest of the
       community. She said they looked for a buyer, sold to that buyer, and moved
       on, thus becoming our responsibility as residents and the duty of the Planning
       Commission to ensure that any development of local land was appropriate and
       an asset to our community, not a detriment. Ms. Cooper said it was safe and
       easy to accommodate the demands of the developer/property owners, but if
       the wrong decision was made, everyone would endure the permanent
       consequences of unmanageable traffic in residential areas where people did
       not want to buy or build. Ms. Cooper said at the November 11th meeting, a
       passing reference was made by Mr. Schweitzer about a demand for apartments
       in Delta Township and to apartment developments that were currently in the



                                                                                          64

       Plan. She said that Planning Director Mark Graham noted that two large
       apartment communities had already been approved for construction in Delta
       Township being Phase II of the Townsend Apartment complex at the
       southwest corner of Nixon and Saginaw Highway which consisted of 280
       units, and an apartment development north of Champion Chrysler at the
       southwest corner of the Creyts/Saginaw Highway intersection which would
       consist of 320 units. She noted that these two communities would provide
       600 apartment units in the near future. Ms. Cooper noted that Mr. Graham
       had also indicated that there were a total of approximately 90 to 100
       additional units proposed as well. She noted that both of these sites were
       much more accessible and that other areas of vacant land could be used for
       apartments that would present fewer problems with traffic accessibility and
       congestion. Ms. Cooper said there wasn't a dire need at this time for a large
       number of apartment units.

       Ms. Cooper said she knew the Commission would be considering several
       rezoning options this evening, including a new proposal proposed by staff,
       and in her view, any rezoning except RC, or a combination of RC and RD
       zoning, represented development that would be a detriment to our community
       and should be rejected. Ms. Cooper said she was strongly opposed to any RE
       zoning for this area.

       MOTION BY MUDRY, SECONDED BY MCCONNELL, THAT THE
       PUBLIC HEARING BE CLOSED. VOICE VOTE. CARRIED 8-0.

       Mr. McConnell asked if there were three alternatives for the Commission's
       consideration this evening.

       Mr. Gruba said there were four alternatives for the Commission's
       consideration.

       Ms. Gabriel felt staff's alternative was a good compromise because she was
       very concerned about the number of dwelling units that could be developed in
       the RE zoning district. Ms. Gabriel noted that another one of her concerns
       was that the RD zoning was going to be located in close proximity to single
       family. Ms. Gabriel said she continued to worry about a future connector road
       between Marketplace and the fact that it could become a cut-thru. Ms.
       Gabriel noted that she would like the road patterns further discussed, but a
       connector road may generate the need for a traffic signal at the
       Broadbent/Saginaw Highway intersection.

       Ms. Cascarilla said it was her understanding that the residential density would
       be spread evenly between the RE and RD zones. In other words, the more
       intense RE zoning would not necessarily have a higher density than RD
       zoning.



                                                                                         65
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF

       Mr. Gruba stated that if the residential areas were developed as a planned unit
       development (PUD), which would require a special land use permit, then the
       residential densities could be averaged between the two zones.

       Ms. Cascarilla asked the applicant if it was their intent to apply for a PUD.

       Mr. Clause said they probably would apply for a PUD, but either way, a site
       plan would be required that would address the connector road between
       Marketplace and Broadbent, as well as the layout of the site.

       Ms. Cascarilla felt the applicant previously mentioned that they would request
       a PUD in order to average the density out.

       Mr. Clouse said that was correct and that during the process, they could also
       work on how the buildings were laid out because it was something the
       Planning Commission and the Township Board would have a great deal of
       input on. Mr. Clouse said they also understood the desire to keep the higher
       density closer to Marketplace Boulevard and further away from Broadbent.

       Mr. McConnell asked if a site plan would come before the Commission for
       review.

       Mr. Gruba said a site plan would come before the Commission for their
       review.

       Ms. Gabriel mentioned the strand of mature trees that were located near the
       existing retention pond and attempts being made during site plan review to
       preserve them.

       Ms. Laforet felt the Planning Commission wanted to encourage new
       development within the Township, but they also wanted to protect the current
       property owners as well. Ms. Laforet questioned whether rezoning half of the
       residential land to RD and the other half to RE would create an undue
       hardship for the applicant.

       Mr. Clouse said they appreciated the Planning Commission's recommendation
       for the commercial portion of their development, but the RD and RE zoning
       layout of their development had been studied and was something they were
       comfortable with. He said whereas they would have liked to have rezoned the
       entire parcel RE, they also appreciated the fact that there were additional
       concerns with density and traffic patterns. Mr. Clouse said they didn't want to
       present any hardships and that these concerns were something they would
       work closely with staff on and the Planning Commission in the future.




                                                                                         66

       MOTION BY CASCARILLA, SECONDED BY MCCONNELL, THAT
       THE DELTA TOWNSHIP PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMEND
       TO THE DELTA TOWNSHIP BOARD APPROVAL OF THE
       REQUEST TO REZONE AN AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 41.7
       ACRES AS DESCRIBED IN THE AMENDED LEGAL DESCRIPTION
       FOR CASE NO. 10-13-18 FROM RB, LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL,
       AND RC MODERATE DENSITY RESIDENTIAL, TO 15.29 ACRES
       RE, HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL, AND 26.41 ACRES RD,
       MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL, AS ILLUSTRATED IN FIGURE
       6, BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS:

       1. THE REZONING REQUEST MEETS THE CRITERIA IN
          SECTION 25.4.0 OF THE DELTA TOWNSHIP ZONING
          ORDINANCE AS FOLLOWS:

         a. THE AREA IN QUESTION POSSESSES PHYSICAL
            FEATURES COMPATIBLE WITH THE PROPOSED ZONING
            DISTRICT DUE TO THE EXISTENCE OF A 7+ ACRE
            DETENTION POND ON THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF
            THE SUBJECT PARCEL PROVIDES A PROPER
            TRANSITION TO THE COMMERCIAL USES
            RECOMMENDED TO THE NORTH ON THE FUTURE LAND
            USE MAP IN THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.

       2. THE PROPOSED RD ZONING DISTRICT WILL CONFORM TO
          THE GOALS & POLICIES IN THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
          AND SECTION 1.2.0, PURPOSE, OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE
          AS FOLLOWS:

         a. THE FUTURE LAND USE MAP IN THE DELTA TOWNSHIP
            COMPREHENSIVE PLAN RECOMMENDS MULTIPLE
            FAMILY RESIDENTIAL LAND USES ON THE SUBJECT
            PARCEL.

         b. THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE VICINITY OF THE
            SUBJECT PARCEL IS ADEQUATE TO SERVE THE
            MULTIPLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL USES PERMITTED IN
            THE RD ZONING DISTRICT AS FOLLOWS: 16" WATER
            MAIN AND A 12" SANITARY SEWER ARE LOCATED
            WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE BOULEVARD RIGHT OF
            WAY, THE LAZELL DRAIN SERVES THE PROPERTY,
            MARKETPLACE BOULEVARD HAS FIVE LANES
            ADJACENT TO THE SUBJECT PARCEL, THERE ARE
            TRAFFIC SIGNALS AT THE MARKETPLACE/WEST
            SAGINAW AND MARKETPLACE/ST. JOE INTERSECTIONS,



                                                                 67
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF

                THE M-43/I-96 INTERCHANGE IS LOCATED
                APPROXIMATELY A HALF MILE FROM THE PROPERTY,
                AND THERE ARE SIDEWALKS ALONG THE MAJORITY OF
                THE MARKETPLACE BOULEVARD FRONTAGE.

            c. THE LANDSCAPING AND BUILDING SETBACK
               REQUIREMENTS OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE, AS WELL
               AS SITE PLAN REVIEW BY THE PLANNING COMISSION,
               CAN INSURE COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE FUTURE
               LOWER DENSITY RESIDENTIAL LAND USES TO THE
               SOUTH AND WEST AND THE COMMERCIAL LAND USES
               TO THE NORTH.

        ROLL CALL VOTE. MOTION PASSED 8-0.

        Ms. Laforet said she appreciated Ms. Cooper attending the meetings and
        expressing her views and that of her neighbors. She hoped that the
        compromise made this evening was a balance of lower density residential and
        addressed some of her concerns.

        Ms. Cooper said the alternative that the Planning Commission recommended
        did somewhat promote a "step down" approach which would buffer the
        existing single family residential neighborhood from the proposed commercial
        and high-density residential zoning.

        Ms. Laforet indicated that a site plan would be reviewed by the Commission
        at which time traffic patterns would be taken into account.

XI   PLANNING DIRECTOR COMMENTS

     Community Development Director Mark Graham said when the Commission
     reviewed the subdivision plat for Phases 3 and 4 of the Pointe West subdivision,
     residents had expressed concerns with flooding in the area and subsequently, the
     Commission passed a resolution requesting that the Drain Commissioner hold a
     meeting with the residents. Mr. Graham noted that a meeting was scheduled for




                                                                                        68
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF
JANUARY 13, 2014, PAGE 8


    January 14th at 7:00 p.m. at the Township Hall and he noted that all residents in
    the Pointe West subdivision had been notified.

    Mr. McConnell wanted to acknowledge Mr. Graham for his efforts in soliciting
    the meeting.

    Mr. Graham said an informational meeting would be held on January 23rd for
    residents regarding the installation of sidewalks along two blocks of Arden Road.
    He noted that building permit values had doubled over the past three years. Mr.
    Graham indicated that a debriefing was held in regards to the Emergency Center
    Activation during the ice storm in December.

    Ms. Gabriel commented on how random the power outages were within the
    Township during the ice storm.

    Mr. Graham said years ago the boundary between Consumers Energy and the
    Board of Water & Light was Creyts Road, but when the Marketplace
    development was proposed several years ago, discussions took place at that time
    about what utility department would service the area. Mr. Graham indicated that
    the Board of Water & Light was owned by Lansing, but there wasn't any
    representation in Delta. He didn't know how the decision was made as to what
    utility company would serve a certain development and he noted that the decision
    was already made by the time he conducted his review of new development.

    Ms. Cascarilla said her neighborhood was without power for eight days, but her
    street lights continued to work. When she visited the Board of Water & Light,
    she was informed that the street lights were under Consumers Energy. Ms.
    Cascarilla said it was her understanding that the Board of Water Light would be
    holding a public session on Thursday, January 16th at 7:00 p.m. at the Township
    Hall. Ms. Cascarilla said it was her understanding that there a National
    restaurant/bar chain would be locating in the Lansing Mall in the same wing of
    the new movie theaters.

    Mr. Graham said staff was aware that the Lansing Mall would be making
    changes, but he had not been informed of what those changes would be.

    Ms. Laforet inquired about the vacant retail space next to Ollie's department
    store.

    Mr. Graham said it was his understanding that a Sears Outlet store would be
    located in that space.

    Mr. Mudry inquired whether the Township tracked the results of the free radon
    kits that would be available.




                                                                                        69
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF DELTA PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES OF
JANUARY 13, 2014, PAGE 9


       Mr. Graham felt any tracking would be done by the Health Department.

       Ms. Laforet said due to her experience as a Realtor, approximately 25% of the
       homes that were tested as part of a sale agreement texted positive.
       Mr. Mudry questioned if there was any requirements for Realtors to go through a
       system of containment if a house tested positive.

       Ms. Laforet said new legislation was currently before the State Legislators that
       would make containment mandatory. However, she noted that the Michigan
       Association of Realtors was opposing the legislation due to the fact that testing
       was so sensitive to a variety of conditions that test results could be skewed. Ms.
       Laforet noted that if people were concerned about radon, she informed them to
       put a fix order in for their home. She indicated that a home could test ok now but
       in six months, the house could test differently depending on the concentration of
       the radon levels in the air, or based on the air flow in the house. Ms. Laforet
       informed the Commission that the Association of Relators were anticipating a
       12% rise in new home starts nationally which she felt was encouraging.

       Mr. MacLaren inquired about the reference made this evening about an apartment
       development near the Champion car dealership.

       Mr. Graham said a reference was made by Ms. Cooper about existing properties
       within the Township that were already approved for high density residential. He
       noted that the Township had two Consent Judgments that were approved years
       ago for the property adjacent to the Champion car dealership and property located
       at the southwest corner of the Nixon/Saginaw Highway intersection.

Subject: Marketplace Alternative Residential Zoning

Mr. Graham:
The EYDE Company has settled on a proposed alternative
plan for the requested all RE zoning amendment.

Attached, please find a re-described survey plan showing
proposed RD Net area of approximately 8.43 acres, described as
running 566.73 on the half-section line to a line approximately
700 south of the half-section line for a gross area of 9.10 acres
less a portion of the detention easement of .67 acres.

The remaining RE area of approximately 32.60 acres less the
major portion of the detention easement yields a Net area of
approximately 25.74 acres.

The proposed 21.76 acres for B-2 remains the same.

Summary:

Detention Area outside the R.O.W.           7.53 acres
NET RE Area:                             25.74 acres
NET RD Area:                              8.43 acres
Total Residential Zoning Amendment:        41.70 acres

Please acknowledge receipt of this email and attachment.

Thanks,

DICK COOLEY

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this study is to determine the difference in the traffic being generated for
a proposed zoning district amendment request of a 63.46 acre parcel on Marketplace
Boulevard, Delta Charter Township, Eaton County, Michigan. The site is located on the
west side of Marketplace Boulevard, north of St. Joseph Highway, in Delta Charter
Township, Eaton County, Michigan.

The rezoning request is for two (2) separate land descriptions. The first is an existing
21.76 acre parcel currently zoned Moderate Density Residential (RC) and the proposal is
rezone this acreage to Community Commercial (B2) zoning. The second acreage is an
existing 41.70 acres which consists of an existing zoning of a combination of Low
Density Residential (RB) and Moderate Density Residential (RC), and the proposed
request is to rezone to High Density Residential (RE).

Within the 41.70 acres is 7.53 acres which has been designated for a drainage easement,
which was deducted out of the 41.70 acreage for trip generation purposes, resulting in a
developable acreage of 34.17 acres. The total acreage of both parcels that was used in
this study for trip generation purposes is 55.93 acres.

The future uses and site layout for the either parcel has not been determined; therefore,
the trip generation for future development was determined by the largest trip generator
use allowed under the zoning categories.

The traffic analysis consists of the following items:

   ·   Comparison of trips being generated with the existing zoning versus the requested
       new zoning.

   ·   Discussion of any potential sight distance issues.

This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines set forth in "Evaluating
Traffic Impact Studies, A Recommended Practice for Michigan Communities" sponsored
by the Tri-County Regional Planning Commission and the Michigan Department of
Transportation and the City of East Lansing Zoning Ordinance.

EXISTING CONDITIONS

Marketplace Boulevard is a five-lane paved roadway with concrete curb and gutter.
There is a concrete sidewalk along the entire frontage of the proposed site. Marketplace
Boulevard is under the jurisdiction of the Eaton County Road Commission. There is no
posted speed limit on Marketplace Boulevard.



LAND USE

The project site is vacant land. Surrounding land uses include mostly commercial/retail
to the north, with some residential and commercial office buildings to the east. The
property to the south is vacant up to St. Joseph Highway with single family residential
along the north side of St. Joseph Highway.




                                                                                      87

REZONING

The rezoning request includes overlapping of multiple parcels of property. The existing
zoning for the 55.93 acres of buildable property under consideration for rezoning is 34.41
acres of Moderate Density Residential (RC), and 21.52 acres of Low Density Residential
(RB). The proposed new zoning would change the 55.93 acres into a 21.76 acre parcel of
Community Commercial (B2) and a 34.17 acre parcel of High Density Residential (RE).

At the request of the Delta Charter Township Planning Department, this analysis includes
trip generation for uses permitted "by right" under the requested zoning categories and by
Special Land Use (SLU), which includes Planned Unit Developments (PUD's) for the
residential uses. The permitted by right and the Special Land Use categories were
analyzed for both existing and proposed zoning.

Based on the Delta Charter Township zoning categories, the following was determined:

   Existing Zoning      Acreage     Zoning        Size                   Use

The number of units for each of the residential uses was based on the township's rates for
dwelling units per acre by zoning category. The retail square footage was based on the
township's requirement that only 40% of the site is buildable. A 15% reduction was
taken out of that for parking, which resulted in a 25% footprint for the building area of
the available acreage.




                                                                                        88

TRAFFIC GENERATION
The trip generation rates were derived from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition.
For trip generation rates, fitted curve equations were used where available, and per ITE
standards where the correlation factor was greater than 0.75. If the calculated trip
generation rate was greater than the range of rates, the maximum rate in the range of rates
was utilized to determine the most conservative and accurate trip generation. If the
correlation factor was less than 0.75, per ITE standards, the average rate was used.

Single-Family Detached Housing (Land Use Code 210) was selected to represent the
maximum trip generation for the existing zoning categories allowed by right. The ITE
description of Single-Family Detached Housing is as follows:

Single-family detached housing includes all single-family detached homes on individual
lots. A typical site surveyed is a suburban subdivision.

Rental Townhouse (Land Use Code 224) was selected as representing the maximum trip
generation for the existing zoning categories allowed within a planned unit development.
The ITE description of Rental Townhouse is as follows:

Rental townhouses are townhouse developments with rented rather than owned units and
a minimum of two attached units per building structure. Units are not stacked on top of
one another.

Apartments (Land Use Code 220) was selected to represent the maximum trip generation
for the proposed zoning for multiple family dwellings, both by right and within a planned
unit development. The ITE description of Apartments is as follows:

Apartments are rental dwelling units located within the same building with at least three
other dwelling units, for example, quadraplexes and all types of apartment buildings.
The studies included in this land use did not identify whether the apartments were low-
rise, mid-rise, or high-rise.

Discount Club (Land Use Code 857) was selected as representing the maximum trip
generation for the proposed retail site. The ITE description of Discount Club is as
follows:

A discount club is a discount store or warehouse where shoppers pay a membership fee
in order to take advantage of discounted prices on a wide variety of items such as food,
clothing, tires and appliances; many items are sold in large quantities or bulk.

When comparing the trips being generated by the existing zoning to the trips being
generated by the proposed zoning there is a significant increase due to the possibility of a




                                                                                          89
                                                                                        7


discount club store under the proposed zoning. All of the existing zoning is residential
which will always generate fewer trips than a commercial shopping center or big box
retail. The square footage used in this study for commercial use was based on the
allowable 25% building footprint under Delta Township's standards; however, due to
physical and geometric conditions on the proposed rezoning acreage, it is anticipated that
a much smaller building footprint can conceivably be constructed.

The existing vehicle trip generation "by right" is 179 vehicle trips for the AM peak hour,
235 vehicle trips during the PM peak hour, and 2,361 daily trips. The proposed vehicle
trip generation "by right" is 303 vehicle trips during the AM peak hour, 1,215 vehicle
trips in the PM peak hour, and 12,301 daily trips. The increase in trip generation created
by the proposed zoning "by right" is 124 vehicle trips in the AM peak hour, 980 vehicle
trips during the PM peak hour, and 9,940 daily trips.

The existing vehicle trip generation with a planned unit development (PUD) is 182
vehicle trips in the AM peak hour and 188 vehicle trips during the PM peak hour. The
ITE Trip Generation Manual does not provide weekday trip generation information for
Rental Townhouse (Land Use Code 224). The proposed vehicle trip generation with a
PUD is 371 vehicle trips during the AM peak hour, 1,290 vehicle trips in the PM peak
hour, and 13,131 daily trips. The increase in traffic generation created by the proposed
zoning with a PUD is 189 vehicle trips in the AM peak hour and 1,102 vehicle trips
during the PM peak hour.

A comparison summary of all of the possible uses for both the existing zoning and the
proposed zoning are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.

DISCUSSION
Comparing the Delta Charter Township existing zoning for the 34.41 acres of
Moderate Density Residential (RC), and the 21.52 acres of Low Density Residential
(RB) to the requested new zoning of 34.17 acres of High Density Residential (RE)
and 21.76 acres of Community Commercial (B2), it was determined that there will be
an increase in traffic during both peak periods, as well as in the weekday total.

The Eaton County Road Commission (ECRC) provided 24-hour traffic volume data
on Marketplace Boulevard. The ECRC conducted weekday counts one-half mile
north of St. Joseph Highway in June, 2010. The northbound 24-hour total volume
was 2,813 vehicles, and the southbound total volume was 2,295 vehicles. The AM
peak hour two-way total was 202 vehicles and the PM peak hour two-way total was
517 vehicles per hour.

According to the Highway Capacity Manual (2010 Edition), "the capacity of a
multilane highway segment under base conditions for a 55 mph roadway it is 2,100
passenger vehicle cars per hour per lane; for a 50 mph roadway it is 2,000 passenger
vehicle cars per hour per lane, and for 45 mph roadway it is 1,900 passenger cars per
hour per lane." (pg 14-4) Marketplace Boulevard has an un-posted speed limit;
therefore, the prima fascia speed is 55 mph. Given the design of the roadway, the
location, and the surrounding land uses, it is not expected that motorists are driving an
average speed of 55 mph on Marketplace Boulevard. Not knowing the prevailing
speed of vehicles on Marketplace Boulevard, for the purposes of this study an
assumed speed of 35 mph was used.

Interpolating the HCM highway capacity for a roadway with a 35 mph speed limit
would produce an estimate of 1,700 passenger cars per hour per lane. For a four lane
roadway, excluding the two-way left turn lane along the corridor, Marketplace
Boulevard would have a capacity of 6,800 passenger vehicles per hour. The existing
traffic volumes only utilize approximately three percent (3%) of the roadway capacity
in the AM peak hour and approximately eight percent (8%) in the PM peak hour.

If the proposed requested zoning is approved and the proposed acreage is built out to
the capacity allowed by Delta Township, the proposed traffic volumes on
Marketplace Boulevard would utilize approximately thirteen percent (13%) of the
roadway capacity in the AM peak hour and approximately twenty seven percent
(27%) in the PM peak hour.




                                                                                            93
                                                                                    11




SITE ACCESS

Currently there are no site plans for the proposed requested rezoning acreage;
therefore, a sight distance analysis could not be completed as proposed driveway
locations are yet unknown. When a site plan is available, a sight distance evaluation
should be completed.



CONCLUSIONS

The findings of this study are that the total traffic volumes generated by the proposed
rezoning from the existing Delta Charter Township zoning for the 34.41 acres of
Moderate Density Residential (RC), and the 21.52 acres of Low Density Residential
(RB) to the proposed requested new zoning of 34.17 of High Density Residential
(RE) and 21.76 acres of Community Commercial (B2), will be greater.

Under future conditions assuming that the proposed rezoning acreage parcels are built
to capacity allowed under the requested zoning, the roadway capacity of Marketplace
Boulevard will only be at thirteen percent (13%) during the AM peak hours and
twenty seven percent (27%) during the PM peak hours.

Chris ­(Cc: Mark) See below that went out in our neighborhood communication.. Here was my
understanding of the township request below... If we are still able to send concerns via email, this is
what I would like to voice to our Elected Officials:

Per the updated map that I saw, the commercial (red) rezone request could be good driver for the
townships economy. Although I'm concerned that there is still vacant commercial property across the
street on Marketplace already. It's good that the Secretary of State found a home but its taken awhile
to fill it and its not `new' to the township, rather a `transfer from within'. It would be discouraging to
see more empty buildings rather the promise of something down the road. As a resident in Broadbent
Woods (St. Joe/Broadbent), I still have concerns not only regarding the traffic implications in regards to
proposed apartment zoning but also the loss of taxable revenue for the township if apartment zoning is
granted. Increased traffic not supported by proper road conditions/planning as well as potential
continued overcrowding in the schools. I understand that it is not the Township rather Eaton Co Road
Commission part in regards to roads however, all of this plays part in a not so attractive driver to pull in
homeowners in Delta Township. I know this is not an easy decision and I thank them for allowing us to
view our thoughts as they make an informed decision on the future of township and what is best for it.

Thank you.

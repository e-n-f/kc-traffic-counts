            Memorandum

             To:            Louise Pacheco, Sequoia Union High School District
             CC:            Christopher Dugan, TRA Environmental Sciences, Inc.
             From:          Gicela Del Rio
             Date:          February 14, 2012
             Subject: Carlmont High School Stadium Lighting Project Traffic Analysis




        Introduction
        This memorandum presents the results of the traffic and parking analysis conducted for the Carlmont
        High School Football Stadium Lighting Project. Carlmont High School (CHS) is located at 1400
        Alameda De Las Pulgas, in the City of Belmont, California. The school is part of the Sequoia Union
        High School District (SUHSD) and has a current enrollment of approximately 2,086 high school
        students from the adjacent communities. The school is situated in a mixed residential and commercial
        area. It is bounded on the north by Alameda de Las Pulgas, on the south by vegetated hillside open
        space, on the east by single-family residences along Cranfield Drive, and on the west by multi-family
        residences along Valerga Drive. The Tierra Linda Middle School (operated by the San Carlos School
        District), Crossing Community Church, and single family residences are also located across Alameda
        de Las Pulgas to the north. The Fale Hufanga Tongan United Methodist Church is located immediately
        to the northeast of the CHS campus, with its driveway located just east of Cranfield Drive. Access to the
        school's main parking lot is provided via three existing driveways (see Figure 1). Two of the driveways
        are located at the school's eastern and western boundary, at El Verano Way and Cranfield Avenue,
        respectively. These two driveways provide access to the school's parking areas, located mainly along
        the perimeter of the school site, and the student drop-off areas, located approximately 400 feet from the
        driveway. The third driveway, located on Alameda de Las Pulgas at Chula Vista Drive, provides access
        to a parking area located adjacent to Alameda de Las Pulgas and between the baseball fields and the
        tennis courts and football field.
        The SUHSD is proposing to install permanent field lights at Carlmont High School's existing football
        field, in addition to a permanent field public address (PA) system, and a new field bleacher seating
        system. The football stadium is centrally located within the school campus. The field lighting, in
        conjunction with the other proposed improvements, would be installed in anticipation of hosting night
        time sporting events, such as high school football games, and other events such as soccer and
        lacrosse games, varsity track and field meets, CHS graduation, community youth sports groups
        practices and games, and/or athletic practices. According to information obtained from the SUHSD,
        major sporting events would consist of approximately four to six junior varsity/varsity football games per
        year, which would be held on Friday evenings, although they may be rescheduled to Thursday on rare
        occasions, between 4:00 PM and 10:30 PM.
        According to CHS staff, the existing attendance at varsity football games is typically an average of 700
        attendants. However, attendance is normally highest against traditional "rival" schools, which in the
        case of CHS is Sequoia High School. The last football game against Sequoia High School held at CHS

        Carlmont High School Lighting Project                                                 February 14, 2012 

        took place on November 10, 2011 and was attended by approximately 1,300 spectators. Carlmont High
        School used temporary field lights and field PA system for this game.
        The purpose of this memorandum is to analyze the impacts of the anticipated events occurring as a
        direct result of the stadium lighting, in the context of the transportation system.

        Scope of Study
        Carlmont High School is located within the City of Belmont, in San Mateo County. Based on the
        City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG, the Congestion Management Agency for San Mateo
        County) CMP guidelines, a project's impacts should be analyzed during the weekday AM and PM peak
        periods if it would add more than 100 peak hour trips to the CMP roadway system. CMP facilities within
        the study area include US 101 and I-280. Implicit in this methodology is the assumption that the project
        traffic generation would be sustained over the course of a typical week. However, in the case of special
        events, there is no defined methodology for evaluating project specific impacts. Generally, it is not
        considered economical to design transportation infrastructure for the busiest hour of the year.
        According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
        publication A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets 2001, a "reasonable" design
        standard for streets is the 30th busiest hour of the year (Page 59). Thus, unless the proposed lighting
        project would contain at least 30 major peak hour events per year, it would not be "reasonable" to
        design transportation infrastructure to support the project. According to information obtained from CHS
        staff, the proposed stadium lights would be used for approximately four to six varsity football games per
        year. Thus, the typical standards for roadway design and level of service are not applicable to the
        proposed project.
        However, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) stresses that the potential impacts of a
        project must be disclosed to the public. While it appears that street widening or lane additions may not
        be justified based on the traffic generation from the proposed project, in the spirit of CEQA, it was
        determined by the project traffic consultant (Hexagon Transportation Consultants, Inc) that the
        disclosure of "worst-case" traffic conditions created by the proposed lighting project would be
        appropriate.

        The traffic analysis of a project is based on the associated change in traffic from existing conditions to
        the expected conditions with the project. As mentioned previously, the field lighting would be installed in
        anticipation of hosting night time sporting events, such as high school football games, and other
        sporting and non-sporting events. However, according to information obtained from the SUHSD, only
        football games would be scheduled to occur at a different time than their current schedule once the field
        lights are installed. All other events currently taking place at the school stadium would follow current
        schedules.

        With the proposed stadium lights in place, the home football games would be scheduled to occur at a
        later time than currently scheduled, with the main event (varsity football game) taking place from 7:00 to
        10:30 PM on Fridays. It is expected that evening football games would generate more traffic during the
        PM peak hour than the current day games. Therefore, in order to disclose the "worst-case" traffic
        conditions created by the proposed lighting project, nearby intersections were evaluated for level of
        service (LOS) with and without traffic from a proposed maximum capacity event (a varsity football
        game) on a typical Friday PM peak period.

        Though the field lights would be available for use by other non-football events, unlike football games,
        scheduling of other games/activities currently taking place at the school stadium during the week would
        not change. For non-football events, the intent of the field lights is to enable non-football games, such
        as soccer games which are currently stopped before the end of the game due to lack of lighting, to run
        for the entire length of the game with the proposed field lights in place. It is expected that traffic
        generated by non-football events would be the same without or with the stadium lights.

        Any potential new, non-football event traffic generated as a result of the stadium lights would be that
        associated with people accessing the stadium solely because of the lights (i.e. neighbors accessing the
        field to exercise at night.) However, it is expected that the potential "new" weekday PM peak hour
                                                                                                      Page 3

        project trips would be insignificant, in particular when compared to the traffic that would be generated
        by a sold-out football event, and would not cause any of the study intersections to deteriorate to
        unacceptable levels. Therefore, an analysis of the weekday PM peak hour of traffic (an hour between
        4:00 and 6:00 PM) was deemed unnecessary since the analysis of the Friday PM peak hour (with a
        sold-out football game) would represent the worst-case scenario.

        Study Intersections
        The following intersections were selected for evaluation:

                  1.   Alameda De Las Pulgas and Ralston Avenue
                  2.   Alameda De Las Pulgas and Carlmont Drive (unsignalized)
                  3.   Alameda De Las Pulgas and El Verano Way (unsignalized)
                  4.   Alameda De Las Pulgas and Chula Vista Drive (unsignalized)
                  5.   Alameda De Las Pulgas/San Carlos Avenue and Cranfield Avenue (unsignalized)
                  6.   Dartmouth Avenue/Club Drive and San Carlos Avenue (City of San Carlos)

        Five of the study intersections (four of which are unsignalized intersections) are located within the City
        of Belmont. The intersection of Dartmouth Avenue/Club Drive and San Carlos Avenue is located in the
        City of San Carlos (see Figure 2). The intersections were analyzed during the Friday PM peak period
        that coincides with the "pre-game peak hour" (6:00 to 7:00 PM). The operations of the key intersections
        were evaluated for the following conditions:


            Condition 1: Existing Conditions. Existing conditions were represented by existing Friday peak-
                                hour traffic volumes on the existing roadway network. Existing traffic volumes were
                                obtained from recent traffic counts.

            Condition 2: Existing plus Project Conditions. Existing plus project conditions (hereafter referred
                                to as Project Conditions) were estimated by adding to the existing Friday traffic
                                volumes the additional traffic generated by the project. Project conditions were
                                evaluated relative to existing conditions in order to determine potential project
                                impacts.

        CMP Compliance
        As the Congestion Management Agency (CMA) for San Mateo County, C/CAG is responsible for
        maintaining the performance and standards of the Congestion Management Program (CMP) roadway
        network. The CMP requires new development projected to add 100 or more peak hour trips to the CMP
        roadway network to implement Travel Demand Management (TDM) measures that would reduce
        project impacts. US 101 and I-280 are the only two CMP facilities in the vicinity of the project area. The
        proposed project would not add more than 100 peak hour trips to either of these CMP facilities.
        Therefore, an analysis based on the requirements of C/CAG is not necessary.

        Analysis Methodologies and Level of Service Standards
        Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of
        Service is a qualitative measure of traffic operations, ranging from LOS A (free-flow conditions with little
        or no delay) to LOS F (forced-flow conditions with excessive delays). The various analysis methods are
        described below.

        Signalized Intersections
        According to the City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG) of San Mateo County 2009
        Congestion Management Program (CMP) report, intersection levels of service are to be measured by
        methods described in one of the following documents: The Transportation Research Board's Circular
        212, the latest version of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), or a uniform methodology adopted by
        the CMA that is consistent with the HCM.
        Five out of the six study intersections are located within the City of Belmont (one is located within the
        City of San Carlos). According to City of Belmont staff, the City does not have an adopted level of
        service policy. Since the City of Belmont does not have an adopted level of service standard, these
        intersections were analyzed based on City of San Carlos level of service standards and impact criteria.
        The City of San Carlos adopted methodology for level of service analysis is the Critical Movement
        Analysis methodology (Circular 212). This is one of the methodologies recommended by C/CAG and it
        bases the evaluation of intersection operations on the turning movements that determine signal phasing
        and greentime (the "critical movements"). Thus, this method provides a good indication of the ability of
        an intersection to accommodate additional traffic. Capacities were adjusted to a maximum of 1800
        vehicles per hour for a two-phase signal. The level of service is based on the volume to capacity ratio
        (see Table 1).
        Based on the City of San Carlos level of service standard, the acceptable level of service for the study
        intersections is mid-level LOS D (V/C = 0.85) or better.

        Unsignalized Intersections
        The unsignalized study intersections are located in the City of Belmont. The unsignalized study
        intersections were analyzed using TRAFFIX software, which is based on the Highway Capacity Manual
        (HCM) 2000 method for unsignalized intersections. For two-way stop-controlled intersections, the HCM
        methodology separately evaluates opposing movements and assigns a level of service based on the
        average total delays of traffic on the minor approach waiting for a gap in opposing traffic flow. The two-
        way stop-controlled intersection level of service is not for the intersection as a whole, but rather, it
        describes the worst movement of the intersection, typically left-turning traffic from the minor street
        (controlled movement) onto the major street (uncontrolled movement.) For all-way stop-controlled
        intersections, the control delay is calculated as the average of the entire intersection (average delay of
        all controlled movements.) The average control delay can then be correlated to a level of service as
        shown in Table 2 for unsignalized intersections. The City of Belmont has not adopted an intersection
        level of service policy.

        Signal Warrants
        The level of service analysis at unsignalized intersections is supplemented with an assessment of the
        need for signalization of the intersection. The need for signalization of unsignalized intersections is
        assessed based on the Peak Hour Volume Warrant (Warrant 3) described in the California Manual on
        Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (CA MUTCD), Part 4, Highway Traffic
        Signals, 2010. This method makes no evaluation of intersection level of service, but simply provides an
        indication whether vehicular peak hour traffic volumes are, or would be, sufficient to justify installation of
        a traffic signal. Intersections that meet the peak hour warrant are subject to further analysis before
        determining that a traffic signal is necessary. Additional analysis may include unsignalized level of
        service analysis and/or operational analysis such as evaluating vehicle queuing and delay. Other
        options such as traffic control devices, signage, or geometric changes may be preferable based on
        existing field conditions. Additionally, engineering judgment is exercised on a case-by-case basis to
        evaluate the effect a traffic signal will have on certain types of accidents and traffic conditions at the
        subject intersection as well as at adjacent intersections.

        Intersection Operations Methodology
        The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand movements at intersections.
        Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the probability
        of "n" vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:

                  P (x=n) =           n e  ()
                                        n!
        Where:

                  P (x=n) = probability of "n" vehicles in queue per lane
                  n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
                   = average number of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hour per lane/signal cycles
                      per hour)

        The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the
        95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
        estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25
        feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned
        available storage capacity for the movement.

        Existing Conditions
        This section describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities in the vicinity of
        the Carlmont High School campus, including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and
        pedestrian facilities.

        Existing Transportation Setting
        Carlmont High School is located at 1400 Alameda de Las Pulgas, in the City of Belmont. Regional
        vehicle access to the project site is provided via Alameda de Las Pulgas and Ralston Avenue (see
        Figure 1). Direct access to the project site is provided via Alameda de Las Pulgas. These facilities are
        described below.

                 Alameda de Las Pulgas is mainly a northwest roadway that extends from Santa Cruz Avenue
                  in Menlo Park northward to San Mateo where it terminates at a T-intersection with Crystal
                  Springs Road. At its intersection with San Carlos Avenue, in San Carlos, Alameda de Las
                  Pulgas changes designation to San Carlos Avenue, and it changes back to Alameda de Las
                  Pulgas at Cranfield Avenue, in Belmont. Alameda de Las Pulgas transverses the Cities of
                  Menlo Park, Redwood City, San Carlos, Belmont, and San Mateo. It is mainly a two-lane
                  roadway with the exception of most of the segment within the City of San Mateo, which is a
                  four-lane segment. Alameda de Las Pulgas is also CHS's northern boundary, and it provides
                  direct access to the school's parking areas via driveways at El Verano Way, Chula Vista Drive,
                  and a driveway parallel to Cranfield Avenue. It should be noted that although the driveway
                  providing access to the school is not on Cranfield Avenue but next to it (west of it), for
                  simplicity, this driveway is referred to as the Cranfield driveway within this report. A second
                  driveway also is located parallel to the school driveway and Cranfield Avenue, east of Cranfield
                  Avenue. This second driveway provides access to the Fale Hufanga Tongan United Methodist
                  Church, located immediately to the northeast of the CHS campus.

                 Ralston Avenue is mainly a four-lane arterial that extends from SR 92 to US 101. West of SR
                  92, it becomes Polhemus Road while east of US 101 it becomes Marine Parkway. Ralston
                  Avenue provides access to the project site via its intersection with Alameda de Las Pulgas.

        Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
        Existing pedestrian access to the school site entrances on Alameda de Las Pulgas is provided by
        sidewalks on Alameda de Las Pulgas and adjacent residential streets. Sidewalks are found along one
        or both sides of most residential streets in the vicinity of the school, with crosswalks provided at all
        intersections on Alameda de Las Pulgas in the vicinity of the school. However, sidewalks are missing
        along the north side of Alameda de Las Pulgas, between Chula Vista Drive and Cranfield Avenue,
        along both sides on Cranfield Avenue, and along one or both sides of San Carlos Avenue, between
        Beverly Drive and Cordilleras Avenue.
        Bike lanes are provided along the following roadway segments in the vicinity of the project site:

                 Alameda de Las Pulgas, between Carlmont Drive and Cranfield Avenue, and between San
                  Carlos Avenue and Edgewood Road

                 San Carlos Avenue, between Beverly Drive and Elm Street

                 Ralston Avenue, between S Road (west of El Camino Real) and Alameda de Las Pulgas

        Parking
        According to CHS staff, the high school currently has 361 parking spaces on-site, including staff,
        student, handicapped, and visitor parking spaces. The parking spaces are provided within two parking
        areas: the first parking area located along the perimeter of the school (not including Alameda de Las
        Pulgas) and accessed via the driveways at El Verano Way and Cranfield Avenue, consists of
        approximately 236 parking spaces, while the second parking area, located along Alameda de Las


                                                                                                           Page 9

        Pulgas and accessed via the driveway at Chula Vista Drive, consists of approximately 125 parking
        spaces.
        Additionally, approximately 38 parking spaces are provided along the school frontage on Alameda de
        Las Pulgas, between Chula Vista Drive and Cranfield Avenue. These parking spaces are undesignated
        on-street parking spaces.

        Transit Service
        Existing transit service in the vicinity of the school site is provided by the San Mateo County Transit
        District (SamTrans). The closest bus stops are located at the intersections of Alameda de Las Pulgas
        and El Verano Way and Dartmouth Avenue/Club Drive and San Carlos Avenue. SamTrans provides
        bus service along the following two routes:
            Route 260 provides service between the San Carlos Caltrain Station and the College of San Mateo,
             with stops at the Carlmont Village Shopping Center, Downtown Belmont, Notre Dame de Namur University,
             Redwood Shores, and Chula Vista and Fernwood. The Chula Vista and Fernwood route is only served
             on weekdays for a limited time period in the morning and afternoon, to coincide with the beginning
             and end of the school day at CHS.
            Route 295 provides service between the Menlo Park and San Mateo Caltrain stations on 30 to 60-
             minute headways via Alameda de Las Pulgas in the vicinity of the project site. Route 295 also
             serves the Redwood City, San Carlos and Hillsdale Caltrain stations.

        Existing Intersection Levels of Service
        The existing lane configurations and signal timing and phasing (for the signalized intersections) were
        determined by observations in the field. Existing traffic volumes at the study intersections were obtained
        from new intersection turning movement counts (conducted in November, 2011). The existing
        intersection lane configurations and intersection turning movement volumes are shown graphically on
        Figure 3.
        The results of the level of service are summarized in Table 3. The operations of the study intersections
        were evaluated, using TRAFFIX software, for the Friday peak hour that coincides with the evening
        football event peak hour (6:00-7:00 PM.) The results show that the study signalized intersections
        currently operate at an acceptable LOS A during the Friday peak hour.
        The results also show that all of the unsignalized study intersections currently operate at LOS C or
        better during the Friday peak hour. The level of service calculation sheets are shown in the attached
        appendix.

        Existing Peak-Hour Signal Warrant
        The results of the peak-hour traffic signal warrant checks are summarized on Table 4. The results
        indicate that none of the unsignalized study intersections currently have peak-hour volumes that satisfy
        the peak-hour traffic signal warrant during the Friday peak-hour (6:00-7:00 PM.) The peak-hour signal
        warrant sheets are contained in the appendix.

        Project Conditions
        This section analyzes traffic conditions on the surrounding transportation network after completion of
        the proposed project. Included are descriptions of the significance criteria that define an impact,
        estimates of project-generated traffic, and identification of project impacts. Project conditions are
        represented by existing traffic with the addition of traffic generated by the project.

        Project Description
        The Sequoia Union High School District (SUHSD) is proposing to install stadium lighting at Carlmont
        High School's (CHS) existing athletic field. The football stadium is centrally located within the school
        campus. The field lighting, in conjunction with the other proposed improvements, would be installed in
        anticipation of hosting night time sporting events, such as high school football games, and soccer and
        lacrosse games, in addition to varsity track and field meets, CHS graduation, community youth sports
        groups practices and games, and/or athletic practices. According to information obtained from the
        SUHSD (based on the current 2011 sporting events schedule for CHS), major sporting events would
        consist of approximately four to six junior varsity/varsity football games per year, which would be held
        on Friday evenings, although they may be rescheduled to Thursday on rare occasions. Additionally,
        there would be approximately 12 soccer games, 8 lacrosse games, and 4 track meets per year, in
        addition to ongoing sport practices, community youth sports, and special events held at the football field
        after installation of the proposed stadium lights. Football games would take place on Fridays from 4:00
        PM to 10:30 PM (Jr. varsity football games would be from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM and varsity football
        games would be from 7:00 PM to 10:30 PM). Soccer and lacrosse games and sport practices would
        take place Monday through Friday, with these events ending by 9:00 PM.
        With the proposed stadium lights in place, the home football games would be scheduled to occur at a
        later time than currently scheduled, with the main event (varsity football game) taking place from 7:00 to
        10:30 PM on Fridays. Even though the field lights also would be available for use by other non-football
        events, unlike football games, scheduling of other games/activities currently taking place at the school
        stadium during the week would not change. For non-football events, the intent of the field lights is to
        enable non-football games, such as soccer games which are currently stopped before the end of the
        game due to lack of lighting, to run for the entire length of the game with the proposed field lights in
        place. It is expected that traffic generated by non-football events during the week would be the same
        without or with the stadium lights.
        According to CHS staff, the existing attendance at varsity football games is typically an average of 700
        spectators. However, attendance is normally highest against traditional "rival" schools, which in the
        case of CHS is Sequoia High School. CHS's inaugural evening game in 2009, which was against
        Sequoia High School, drew approximately 1,800 spectators. Two evening games held in 2010 against
        non-rival opponents drew 800 and 500 spectators. The last football game against Sequoia High School
        held at CHS took place on November 10, 2011 and was attended by approximately 1,300 spectators.
        Carlmont High School used temporary field lights and field public address system for this game. Other
        sporting non-football events taking place at the school stadium during the week, such as soccer and
        lacrosse, are typically attended by a relatively smaller audience (approximately 50 spectators,
        according to CHS staff.)
        In addition to the installation of the stadium lighting, the SUHSD is proposing to install a permanent field
        public address (PA) system, and a new field bleacher seating system. The football stadium currently
        provides bleacher seats for approximately 600 spectators. The proposed new bleachers would be
        located on the north side of the football field, parallel to existing tennis courts, and they would be
        designated as the visitor seating area. The new bleachers would have a seating capacity of 456. With
        new visitor bleachers plus the existing (home) bleachers, the football stadium would have a total
        seating capacity of approximately 1,056 spectators.

        Project Trip Generation and Assignment
        The amount of traffic generated by the proposed project was estimated by applying trip generation rates
        to the size of the project (the maximum number of spectators the CHS football stadium could attract as
        a result of the installation of the proposed stadium lights). The trip rates used for this analysis were
                                                                                                     Page 13

        obtained from other similar high school stadium lighting projects in the Bay Area. These high school
        stadium trip generation rates were developed by Fehr and Peers Associates and are based on surveys
        of high school football events at schools with stadium lighting (Santa Teresa High School Football
        Stadium Lighting Traffic and Parking Analysis, Memorandum, December 4, 2002). The project's trip
        generation estimates are presented in Table 5.

        The project trip generation was estimated for a sold-out varsity football event. Although the typical
        attendance at varsity football games at CHS ranges from 500-1,800 spectators, Hexagon determined
        that the analysis of the project should not be conducted based on the highest attendance (1,800
        spectators) since that was the very first evening game (with the use of temporary field lights) held at
        CHS against a rival school, and as such attendance is believed to be higher than what it would
        "normally" be after installation of the field lights. This in fact is reflected in the attendance to the last
        night game held at CHS against Sequoia High School. Thus, the analysis of the project was conducted
        based on the average of the two largest attendance evening games (1,800 and 1,300 spectators),
        approximately 1,550 spectators. A night game generating 1,550 spectators would represent a sold-out
        game. Although the stadium's seating capacity would be less than the number of spectators estimated
        for a sold-out game, it was assumed that some spectators would be standing, as it was observed at the
        last night game at CHS.
        The surveyed trip generation rates associated with the varsity football game and used for the analysis
        of the project include trips associated with a preceding junior varsity football game. This is reflected in
        the directional split of pre-varsity game traffic (in and outs)Thus, the estimated outbound trips include
        both spectators being dropped-off at the school site for the varsity football event as well as junior varsity
        game attendees leaving the site by driving or being picked-up.
        Based on the above information and assumptions, it was estimated that the stadium lighting project
        would generate 868 trips (608 inbound and 260 outbound trips) during the Friday PM peak hour for a
        sold-out football game.
        It should be noted that capacity events would only occur a maximum of four to six times a year,
        assuming all football games would sell out. Additionally, it was assumed that all traffic generated by a
        sold-out football game, and non-football game event, would be new traffic on the roadway network. This
        is not entirely true, since according to CHS staff, weekday football games take place during the day
        staring at 3:00 PM (2:45 PM after daylight savings time) and finishing at around 6:00 PM, generating
        traffic associated with the football event during the Friday PM peak hour. This traffic is project related
        traffic already on the roadway network. Nevertheless, this study included scenarios with total project
        traffic added to peak hour traffic in the interests of disclosing the potential "worst case" scenarios.

        Based on information obtained from CHS regarding the school's attendance area, field observations at
        the existing site, and existing turn-movement counts, the origins of vehicle traffic at CHS were
        estimated as follows:
                 35% from San Carlos Avenue
                 23% from Ralston Avenue, east of Alameda de Las Pulgas
                 15% from Ralston Avenue, west of Alameda de Las Pulgas
                 15% from Alameda de Las Pulgas, north of Ralston Avenue
                 2% from Carlmont Drive
                 2% from El Verano Way
                 2% from Chula Vista Drive
                 3% from Dartmouth Avenue
                 3% from Club Drive
        The trips generated by the proposed project were then assigned to the roadway network based on this
        directional distribution. Figure 4 shows the proposed project's trip distribution and assignment.

        Project Intersection Levels of Service
        Impact Criteria
        Although the City of Belmont does not have adopted impact criteria for intersection analysis, based on
        City of San Carlos level of service impact criteria, the project is said to create a significant adverse
        impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection if, for either peak hour, the level of service at the
        intersection degrades from an acceptable mid-level LOS D (V/C = 0.85) or better under existing
        conditions (or future conditions without the project) to an unacceptable high LOS D, LOS E or F under
        future conditions with the project. If an intersection is found to operate at an unacceptable high-end
        LOS D (V/C > 0.85) or worse under existing conditions (or future conditions without the project), the
        intersection would be impacted by the project if the addition of the project trips would cause the V/C
        ratio at the intersection to increase by 0.01 or more.
        Neither the City of San Carlos nor the City of Belmont have adopted impact criteria for unsignalized
        intersections. It is common for jurisdictions not to have an adopted impact criteria for unsignalized
        intersections. Nevertheless, unsignalized intersection level of service analysis is sometimes performed
        for informational purposes and to identify locations that might need improvements, such as the
        installation of a traffic signal. When that is the case, deficiencies identified at unsignalized intersections
        are typically not considered significant intersection impacts that must be identified and mitigated to
        satisfy CEQA guidelines. Instead, they are identified as intersection operational deficiencies.
        Intersection operational deficiencies are subject to the local jurisdiction's procedures and standards.
        Thus, the unsignalized intersection level of service analysis is provided for informational purposes only.
        Additionally, the level of service analysis at the unsignalized intersections is supplemented with an
        assessment of the need for signalization of the intersection. The need for signalization of unsignalized
        intersections is assessed based on the Peak Hour Volume Warrant (Warrant 3) described in the
        California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (CA MUTCD), Part 4,
        Highway Traffic Signals, 2010.

        Level of Service Results
        The project condition levels of service for the "worst-case" events are shown in Table 6. Under existing
        plus project conditions, the level of service analysis show that the study signalized intersections would
        continue to operate at an acceptable mid-level LOS D or better during the Friday PM peak hour.
        Therefore, the proposed project would not have a negative impact at the study signalized intersections.

        The analysis of the unsignalized intersections under existing plus project conditions show that three of
        the four study unsignalized intersections are projected to deteriorate to LOS E during the Friday PM
        peak hour.
        The level of service calculation sheets are shown in the attached appendix.

        Project Signal Warrants
        The results of the peak-hour traffic signal warrant checks are summarized in Table 7. The results
        indicate that the traffic generated by a Friday sold-out game would cause the traffic signal warrant to be
        met at three of the four study unsignalized intersections. The peak-hour signal warrant sheets are
        contained in the appendix.

        As with the unsignalized intersection analysis, this information is provided for informational purposes
        only. However, it should be noted that temporary measures to control traffic during the beginning and
        end of a sold-out event, such as the use of police officers to direct traffic, could be implemented to help
        improve operations at the unsignalized intersections providing access to the school. It is recommended
        that the SUHSD works with the City of Belmont in an effort to improve operating conditions at these
        intersections during sold-out events at the school's stadium.

        Intersection Operations Analysis
        The analysis of project intersection level of service was supplemented with an analysis of intersection
        operations for selected locations. The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand
        movements at intersections. Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution.
        The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the
        95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
        estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25
        feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned
        available storage capacity for the movement. This analysis thus provides a basis for estimating future
        storage requirements at the selected locations. The queue estimates and a tabulated summary of the
        findings for the weekday and Friday PM peak hours are provided in Table 8. The Poisson probability
        calculation sheets are provided in the appendix.

        It should be noted that deficiencies identified by the intersection operations analysis are typically not
        considered significant intersections impacts but instead are identified as intersection operational
        deficiencies. Intersection impacts, such as level of service impacts, must be identified and mitigated to
        satisfy CEQA guidelines. Intersection operational deficiencies, however, are subject to the local
        jurisdiction's procedures and standards.
        The operations analysis indicated that the estimated maximum vehicle queue for the westbound left
        turn movement on Ralston Avenue to southbound Alameda De Las Pulgas would exceed the existing
        vehicle storage capacity under existing plus project conditions during the Friday PM peak hour.
        However, the same turn movement is shown to be deficient under existing conditions. The maximum
        queue length for this movement is projected to be 11 vehicles (or 275 feet long) under existing
        conditions. The existing storage capacity for this movement is approximately 200 feet. Under existing
        plus project conditions, the project traffic would extend the vehicle queue length by as many as 6
        vehicles (or from 275 to 425 feet) during the Friday PM peak hour. It is not possible to extend this left-
        turn pocket due to the adjacent eastern intersection of Villa Avenue and Ralston Avenue.
        Due to the additional traffic that would be generated during the PM peak hour as a result of the stadium
        lighting, there will likely be periods of traffic congestion on the roadways before and after major events.
        This would occur since event traffic demand is typically not spread evenly throughout the peak hour, but
        it is not expected to last for long periods of time.
        To help deal with these periods during a sold-out event, the following measures are recommended:

            Traffic flaggers should be used at the school's existing driveways and onsite to help patrons locate
             parking spaces.
            To address the congestion at intersections providing direct access to the school, the SUHSD in
             conjunction with the City of Belmont may wish to employ the use officers/flaggers at these
             intersections to control and direct traffic as they enter and/or leave the school site.

        Parking Analysis
        According to CHS staff, the high school currently has 361 parking spaces on-site, including staff,
        student, handicapped, and visitor parking spaces. The parking spaces are provided within two parking
        areas: the first parking area located along the perimeter of the school (not including Alameda de Las
        Pulgas) and accessed via the driveways at El Verano Way and Cranfield Avenue, consists of
        approximately 236 parking spaces, while the second parking area, located along Alameda de Las
        Pulgas and accessed via the driveway at Chula Vista Drive, consists of approximately 125 parking
        spaces. Additionally, approximately 38 parking spaces are provided along the school frontage on
        Alameda de Las Pulgas, between Chula Vista Drive and Cranfield Avenue. These parking spaces are
        undesignated on-street parking spaces. All together, the total parking supply for the school is 399
        parking spaces.
        Although not specific to high school stadiums, the City of Belmont Schedule of Parking Requirements
        (Section 8.4 of the City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance) includes parking requirements for stadiums
        (section 8.4.6 Community Service Uses). Parking requirements for this land use, described as
        stadiums, arenas, auditoriums (other than college or school), convention halls, dance halls, exhibit
        halls, skating rinks, and other similar places of assembly, require provision of parking spaces equal to
        20 percent of capacity in persons. Applying the City of Belmont parking requirement to the estimated
        number of spectators at a sold-out varsity football game (instead of the number of seats since it was
        estimated that a sold-out varsity football game would generate more spectators than the future stadium
        seating capacity), it was estimated that a sold-out varsity football game would have a parking demand
        of 310 parking spaces (1550 spectators x 0.20= 310).
        Since the rates specified in the City of Belmont's parking requirements are not specific to high school
        stadiums, additional research on the parking requirements for stadiums in various Bay Area cities was
        done. Various cities' parking requirements list the required number of parking spaces for football
        stadiums, ranging from a low of one parking space for each 5 seats (0.20 parking spaces per seat) to
        one parking space for every 3 seats (0.33 parking spaces per seat), with an average of 0.27 parking
        spaces per seat (see Table 9). Please note that in addition to the required number of spaces based on

        the available number of seats, some jurisdictions also require additional parking for usable floor area
        and/or employees.
        Using a conservative assumption of one parking space for every 3 spectators, a sold-out varsity football
        game would require 517 parking spaces. Applying the calculated average of all the stadium parking
        requirements available (0.27 parking spaces per seat), a total of 419 parking spaces would need to be
        provided.
        As a check, the parking demand also was estimated based on the trip generation estimates. It was
        estimated that there would be 608 inbound peak hour trips generated by a sold-out varsity football
        game. Out of the 608 trips, 260 would be dropping off (or picking up) spectators, and the remaining 348
        (608-260=348) would be parking for the game. To this must be added cars already parked for the
        Junior Varsity game, which would be estimated to be at least 100 cars.
        Based on the parking demand estimates above, the parking supply at CHS (399 spaces including on-
        street spaces) would not be sufficient to serve the projected parking demand during a sold-out football
        game, which could potentially experience a parking shortage of up to 100 parking spaces.
        Carlmont High School has previously worked with the neighboring churches to be able to use their
        parking supply during high trip generating events at the high school. Additionally, the SUHSD is
        considering construction of a new parking area, north of the football stadium and adjacent to the
        existing tennis courts, that would provide an additional 50 to 75 parking spaces to serve the school. A
        new parking area, in conjunction with off-site parking agreements and the existing on-site parking
        supply, would result in adequate parking supply to serve the projected parking demand generated by a
        sold-out football event.
        Other parking management strategies that could be implemented to ensure that adequate parking
        spaces will be available at the school site during a sold-out football game include:
                 The school should not schedule other events on campus during the same evening as a sold-out
                  stadium event
                 A parking plan should be developed to fully utilize all available parking within the school parking
                  areas. This may require directing traffic flow in and out of the school parking areas and
                  directing drivers to available parking spaces.
                 Open space within the school campus could be used to provide temporary parking areas. This
                  could include parking on existing grass fields, basketball courts, or any other available open
                  space.
                 The school might want to consider procuring an off-site parking agreement with one of the
                  adjacent schools and/or churches in the case additional parking is needed.
                 The school should advise football fans to carpool to the games.
                 The school should advise event patrons not to park in the adjacent neighborhood.

        Conclusion
        The results of this analysis indicate that there generally would be adequate roadway capacity to
        accommodate the proposed Carlmont High School stadium lighting project under worst-case traffic
        conditions.
        The level of service analysis show that the study signalized intersections would continue to operate at
        an acceptable mid-level LOS D or better during the Friday PM peak hour. Therefore, the proposed
        project would not have a negative impact at the study signalized intersections.
        The analysis of the unsignalized intersections show that three of the study unsignalized intersections
        are projected to deteriorate to LOS E during the Friday PM peak hour.
        The results of the peak-hour traffic signal warrant checks indicate that the traffic generated by a Friday
        sold-out game would cause the traffic signal warrant to be met at three of the four study unsignalized
        intersections, including the Alameda De Las Pulgas/Carlmont Drive intersection which was shown to
        warrant a traffic signal under existing conditions.
        Both the unsignalized intersection analysis and the signal warrant checks are provided for informational
        purposes only. However, it should be noted that temporary measures to control traffic during the
        beginning and end of a sold-out event, such as the use of police officers to direct traffic, could be
        implemented to help improve operations at the unsignalized intersections providing access to the
        school. It is recommended that the SUHSD works with the City of Belmont in an effort to improve
        operating conditions at these intersections during sold-out events at the school's stadium.
        The operations analysis indicated that the estimated maximum vehicle queue for the westbound left
        turn movement on Ralston Avenue to southbound Alameda De Las Pulgas would exceed the existing
        vehicle storage capacity under existing plus project conditions during the Friday PM peak hour. The
        existing storage capacity for this movement is approximately 200 feet. Under existing plus project
        conditions, the project traffic would extend the vehicle queue length by as many as 6 vehicles (or from
        275 to 425 feet) during the Friday PM peak hour. It is not possible to extend this left-turn pocket due to
        the adjacent eastern intersection of Villa Avenue and Ralston Avenue.
        Based on the parking demand estimates above, the parking supply at CHS (399 spaces including on-
        street spaces) would not be sufficient to serve the projected parking demand during a sold-out football
        game, which could potentially experience a parking shortage of up to 100 parking spaces.
        Carlmont High School has previously worked with the neighboring churches to be able to use their
        parking supply during high trip generating events at the high school. Additionally, the SUHSD is
        considering construction of a new parking area, north of the football stadium and adjacent to the
        existing tennis courts, that would provide an additional 50 to 75 parking spaces to serve the school. A
        new parking area, in conjunction with off-site parking agreements and the existing on-site parking
        supply, would result in adequate parking supply to serve the projected parking demand generated by a
        sold-out football event.
        Other parking management strategies that could be implemented to ensure that adequate parking
        spaces will be available at the school site during a sold-out football game include:
                 To address the congestion at intersections providing direct access to the school, the SUHSD in
                  conjunction with the City of Belmont may wish to employ the use officers/flaggers at these
                  intersections to control and direct traffic as they enter and/or leave the school site.
                 The school should not schedule other events on campus during the same evening as a sold-out
                  stadium event
                 A parking plan should be developed to fully utilize all available parking within the school parking
                  areas. This may require directing traffic flow in and out of the school parking areas and
                  directing drivers to available parking spaces.
                 Open space within the school campus could be used to provide temporary parking areas. This
                  could include parking on existing grass fields, basketball courts, or any other available open
                  space.

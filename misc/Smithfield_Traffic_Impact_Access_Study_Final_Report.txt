Introduction
This transportation study provides an assessment of the potential traffic impacts, area circulation and
access plan associated with the proposed Putnam Pike Commercial Development in Smithfield, Rhode
Island. This study was completed under contract to the Town of Smithfield. The project location with
respect to the area roadway system is shown in Figure 1. The project is located off the Route 44 corridor
just east of I-295 and bounded on the east by Esmond Street. The general area in the vicinity of the
proposed project is currently developed with commercial/office uses on Route 44 and primarily residential
uses on/near Esmond Street between Route 44 and Dean Avenue. While the site is zoned for business,
there are concerns due to its location, the current roadway geometry and controls near the site and the
existing traffic flow conditions in the project area.

As currently proposed, the project is to consist of 79,100 square feet (sf) of retail use, 60,000 square feet
of office space and 10,600 sf of restaurant space. In addition, an existing 7,100 sf building that housed a
restaurant/pub in the past will be renovated and reused with similar use as part of the current
development plan as well. As proposed by the Applicant, the project is to be served by five (5)
access/egress points to either Route 44 (2) or Esmond Street (3).

This traffic study took into account the guidelines published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers
and well as guidelines for traffic studies used in the State. As the following sections of the report
document, the assessment included a review of the existing traffic environment, an estimate of future
traffic flow conditions and an assessment of the expected traffic operations with and without the project to
determine the level of impact. The proposed access plan was reviewed and a set of actions outlined for
consideration should the development move forward.

Project Summary

This transportation review and assessment was completed for the purpose of assessing potential traffic
impacts, area traffic circulation and access characteristics associated with the proposed Putnam Pike
Commercial Development (PPCD). The development is proposed to consist of a mix of office, retail and
restaurants located on Route 44 in Smithfield. It is currently planned to consist of approximately 149,700
total square footage (sf) that includes of 79,100 sf of retail use, 10,600 sf of restaurant use, and 60,000 sf
of office use. The existing 7,100 sf restaurant/pub buildingg located adjacent to Route 44 will be
renovaated as well. The review area focused on a set of roadways and intersections within a short
distance the site in Smithfield that would be impacted by the proposed project.

The immediate vicinity of the proposed project is currently developed with commercial/office, restaurants
and residential uses. Based on the transportation review and analyses, the intersections and roadway
sections within the study area were identified as currently experiencing some traffic flow constraints and
would be impacted by the proposed project. The proposed project is estimated to add a substantial
amount of new traffic to the abutting roadway system, particularly during the afternoon peak hours and on
Saturday. The currently noted issues become more pronounced as well as the study intersections begin
to operate at lower or poor levels of service as a result of the development. The key findings from the
analysis are as follows:

        The level of service analysis showed that the overall operating conditions of the two study
        intersections including the Route 44 intersection with Esmond Street were currently
        operating at generally acceptable peak hour levels. Although this specific section of
        Route 44 is less intensely developed than the west side of the highway and despite the
        overall LOS findings, there are issues that exist in the study section that affect the actual
        efficiency and safety of the traffic flow at this location. Most notably, the high volume
        movement between Route 44 and Esmond street, the inadequately designated exclusive
        turn lanes and the short distance between the I-295 NB off-ramp and the Esmond Street
        intersection.

        With the development project and no major improvements, the operating levels of the two
        study intersections reduce to LOS `E' or LOS `F' during the weekday afternoon or
        Saturday midday peak hours.

        The weaving that occurs between the highway off-ramp and intersection is high and
        results in a low level of service particularly during the afternoon peak hour with the
        project.

In relation to the proposed site plan including its layout and proposed drives, there were also a number of
issues or questions. Most notably were the 5 proposed drives to serve the development which is more
than needed to accommodate this size of project as well as the proximity of the drives to the Route
44/Esmond Street intersection. These and the other items should be addressed going forward.

A series of potential actions to address the project's impacts and access needs have been outlined at the
end of this report. Further evaluation is required to fully assess the feasibility of these potential actions
and make a determination of which ones, if any, should be implemented.

Existing Environment
The following section describes the existing transportation system in terms of physical and operational
characteristics. The study area focused on the Route 44 section in relatively close proximity to the
development site and Esmond Street. In developing an understanding of the existing conditions, site
visits were conducted, research completed and data collected.

A. EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK

The study area was defined by the Town at the outset of the study. Route 44 and Esmond Street abut the
development site. The study focused on the evaluation of a set of roadways and intersections in the
vicinity of the site that would be most impacted by the proposed project. The study area intersections
included in this analysis were:

                          ·   Route 44 a I-295 Northbound Ramps
                          ·   Route 44 at Esmond Street
                          ·   Esmond Street at Dean Avenue

General descriptions of these roadways are included in the following paragraphs:

1. Route 44

Route 44 is a major, U.S. highway that runs east-west
from Providence and points east to the west past the
project area towards Connecticut. Route 44 is a major
highway serving this section of Rhode Island. Route 44
comes under the jurisdiction of the Rhode Island
Department of Transportation (RIDOT) in the project area.
In the vicinity of the study area, it is generally a four lane
highway with partially controlled access to abutting
properties. Additional turn lanes currently exist at the
signalized intersection with Esmond Street. A 230-foot
left turn lane in the eastbound direction is provided.
                                                                 Route 44 looking south of Esmond Street

A separate left turn lane and a 130-foot right turn lane are
provided on the Esmond Street approach. There are
commercial properties in the immediate vicinity of the
intersection including a Hess fueling facility, and several
small commercial properties. None of the commercial
drives come under the signal control.

Within approximately 800 feet of Esmond Street, Route 44
intersects with the I-295 northbound on and off-ramps.
There is less than 500 feet from the I-295 NB off-ramp to
the beginning of the left turn taper on Route 44 at its signal
with Esmond Street. I-295 provides accessibility to I-95 in       Route 44 looking north of Esmond Street

Warwick to the south and to Attleboro, Massachusetts area


Proposed PPCD, Traffic Study, Smithfield, Rhode Island                                                Page 3
to the north/east. The section of Route 44 between I-295 and Esmond Street includes a 5 lane section
that accommodates two lanes per direction and a center two way left turn lane (TWLTL) prior to the
exclusive eastbound left turn lane.

The section of Route 44 generally has two lanes per direction for 2,000 feet east of Esmond Street
continuing through the interchange area until approximately 1,800 feet west of Cedar Swamp Road
(Route 5). West of I-295, Route 44 serves a highly commercial area with `The Crossing at Smithfield'
located immediately west of the I-295 southbound off-ramp. During the inventory period for the Putnam
Pike Commercial Development Study, it was generally observed that the traffic signal that provides
access in and out of `The Crossing' has a significant effect on traffic flow on Route 44 through the I-
295/Route 44 interchange. The I-295 interchange ramp intersections are unsignalized. Full north-south
movements are allowed at the interchange.




                                                 Route 44 between I-295 NB off-ramp and Esmond Street


2. Esmond Street

                                                     Esmond Street is a two lane street that provides north-
                                                     south access from its intersection with Route 44 to
                                                     Route 104 approximately 0.75 miles to the north. The
                                                     roadway has varying alignment characteristics
                                                     including a number of gentle horizontal curves along its
                                                     length.    Pavement surface conditions range from
                                                     average to good and generally, sidewalks to not exist
                                                     between Route 44 and Dean Avenue. The roadway
                                                     section between Route 44 and Dean Avenue ranges is
                                                     approximately 26-28 feet.




Proposed PPCD, Traffic Study, Smithfield, Rhode Island                                                Page 4
The intersection with Dean Avenue is currently a four way ALL WAY STOP controlled location. There are
single lanes on each approach (The west leg named Old County Road). The intersection is located
approximately 1,000 feet north of the proposed development site. The East Smithfield Public Library
exists in the northeast quadrant of the intersection as well as a number of residential homes in the area.

3. Dean Avenue

Dean Avenue is a two lane street under local jurisdiction. It
runs from its intersection with Esmond Street to its
intersection with Putnam Pike located 0.8 miles to the east
of I-295. It is level and straight in the vicinity of Esmond
Street. Sidewalks exist along both sides of the street. The
westerly leg of the intersection with Esmond Street
connects with Old County Road that intersects with Sebille
Road (becomes Mountaindale Road) provides for an
eventual connection to Walter Carey Road and Route 5 that
connects with Route 44 and Route 116 on the western edge
of the major retail area approximately 3,500 feet from I-295.

B.    TRAFFIC VOLUMES

In developing traffic analysis networks for this study, new traffic counts were conducted at the three study
intersections. The new data was collected in December 2011 through manual turning movement counts
(TMC) and during the weekday morning (7AM-9AM), weekday evening (4PM-6PM) and the Saturday
midday peak period (11AM-1PM) given this proposed development will contain a substantial amount of
retail use. Daily traffic data for several of the study area roadways were also obtained through collected
48 hour automatic traffic recorder (ATR) counts that were conducted on Route 44, Esmond Street and
Dean Avenue.

While individual intersections within a study network may experience peak traffic flow at different time
periods, review of the new TMC data at the individual intersections indicated that the weekday evening
peak hour occurred between either 4:30-5:30 PM or 4:45-5:45 PM and the Saturday midday peak hour
occurred between 11:15 AM-12:15 PM. The weekday morning peak hour were observed to occur
between either 7:30-8:30 AM or 7:45-8:45 AM. The TMC and ATR data collected as a part of this traffic
study are included in the Appendix.

Table 1 summarizes some of the traffic data that was identified as part of this study. As seen in Table 1,
Route 44 south of the project site carries approximately 24,050 vehicles per day (vpd) on a weekday.
Esmond Street north of the project site was observed to carry approximately 11,360 vehicles on the
weekday. Dean Avenue had an observed weekday volume of approximately 2,300 vehicles over the 24
hour weekday period. It needs to be noted that the traffic counts were collected during the Christmas
shopping season and given the concentration of retail on Route 44, particularly west of I-295, the
observed traffic volumes are likely to be above average levels, though may provide a conservative yet
reasonable base for analysis purposes.

        Note: Data has been rounded.
              Based on observed December 2011 ATR counts


Seasonal Adjustments

For this purpose, count adjustment factors developed by RIDOT for similar types of roadways found in the
project area were obtained and examined. Count adjustment factors developed by RIDOT indicated that
the December data tend to be slightly higher than the average volumes in general. In this particular study
area with the highway and the retail/commercial developments nearby, the December data collected
during the Christmas season will be above average but may also reflect a reasonable condition to
analyze as the volumes will be influenced by the retail and commercial uses for much of the year.
Consequently, the peak hour traffic volumes collected as part of this study were used as is and not further
adjusted.

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the existing weekday afternoon/evening peak hour and Saturday midday peak
hour traffic volumes at the study intersections.

C. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

The project area is currently served by public transportation via the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority
(RIPTA). The RIPTA Route No. 58 travels along Esmond Street between Route 44 and Route 104
connecting with Smithfield Crossings. The route and schedule information is included in the Appendix.
The route also connects with Centerdale, runs along Mineral Spring Road and eventually reaches or
starts at Kennedy Plaza. The service currently runs Monday through Friday with no Saturday or Sunday
service.

D. CRASH EXPERIENCE

The crash experience in the project area is being researched as part of this study. Data for the most
recently available three-year period (2009 to 2011) has been obtained from the Smithfield Police
Department and is in the process of being compiled. The data will be reviewed and summarized in terms
of # of crashes, types and severity of crashes and other characteristics. A supplemental report will be
provided to the Town when completed. Also as part of this study, the RIDOT High Hazard contract #3
Study that included examining the Route 44 intersection with Esmond Street was reviewed.

By 2006 when the RIDOT study was conducted, a left turn lane in the eastbound direction had been
installed as well as the center TWLTL between I-295 NB and the exclusive left turn lane at Esmond
Street. During the 2006 RIDOT review, it was noted that although the intersection computed to be
operating at reasonable peak hour levels of service, (i.e. LOS `C' or higher), the vehicle queuing that was
occurring on Route 44 was very long, particularly related to the eastbound left turn movement - generally
exceeding the defined storage lane capacity that is provided. Crash history at that time indicated
approximately 15 reported crashes per year with the majority of them being rear end type crashes with
20% of the reported crashes resulting in injuries. Short term recommendations from that RIDOT study
included lengthening the EB storage lane to at least 350' from the present 230' and modifying the signal
timing. Current inventories indicate that storage length has not been increased at this point. RIDOT did
recently (December 2011) complete a review of the signal timing and installed some minor changes
(note: these have been incorporated into this analysis).

Probable Impacts of the Project
In this section of the report, the impact of the proposed Putnam Pike development located off Route 44
and Esmond Street at I-295 in Smithfield on the roadway network within the defined study area is
described. For analysis purposes and to comply with typical traffic analyses guidelines for major projects
such as this, a future year build out condition was developed. Given the size of the proposed
development, it is presumed to take 1 to 2 years to permit, construct and occupy. It is typical in the New
England region that a 5 to 10 year future conditions analysis be completed when assessing the impact of
a new project. Presuming the project can advance though the permit and construction tasks over the
next two years, a future analysis year of 2018 was selected whereby the development would be fully built
and occupied by that time. This represents a 5 year future conditions analysis from the time occupancy
can actually begin.

Based this approach, a 2018 No-Build traffic volume network was developed by taking into account
existing traffic volumes, areawide background traffic volume growth, and traffic from other potential site
specific (background) developments. The No-Build alternative would not include any development on the
subject site other than the re-use of the former restaurant/pub that abuts Route 44. If appropriate, known
transportation related improvements in the study area that would be completed within the analysis
timeframe would also be assumed in the future conditions. The addition of site trips generated by the
proposed development to the 2018 No-Build traffic volume networks produces the estimated 2018 Build
traffic volume networks.

The impact of No-Build and Build traffic conditions during the weekday morning, weekday evening and
Saturday midday peak hours were then evaluated by examining increases in traffic volumes and the
operating conditions at the study intersections.

A. NO-BUILD TRAFFIC VOLUMES

In general, growth in traffic typically occurs over the years due to a combination of population and
economic activity. This issue needs to be considered although overall economic activity over the past 4
to 5 years has been sluggish at best in the larger region. In developing No-Build traffic projections, both
growth rate analysis and the identification of site specific developments were completed.

1. Background Traffic Growth

To establish a traffic growth rate for the study area, historical traffic count data collected in the study area
as part of past studies as well as data collected obtained by RIDOT. In addition, research was conducted
at the local level including examining socio-economic data. Population changes in the area communities
including but not limited to Smithfield, North Smithfield, North Providence and Johnston between 2000
and 2010 indicated a change of approximately 0.2% per year with communities experiencing small
increases or in the case of North Providence, a small decrease in population during this time period.

                                                                                 1,2,3
Historical data available for the corridor through previous studies                      were also reviewed that provided

insight related to changes in traffic volumes over the past 5 to 8 years. These data when compared to the
data collected as part of the study reveals comparable levels of volume (i.e. no major changes in volume
between 2003 and present day).

Taking all these factors into consideration, a background traffic growth rate of 0.5% per year was selected
for the next two years and a rate of 1% per year applied for the successive 5 year period to obtain future
(2018) base growth in traffic volumes.

2. Site Specific Developments

Also as part of developing the 2018 No-Build traffic conditions, information on additional approved or
planned projects that are anticipated within the analysis time frame in the vicinity of the proposed project
were also requested from the Smithfield Planning Department.

Based on these discussions, there were several projects in close proximity to the proposed development
identified and in some stage of the development process. One of these, a small commercial (5,400 sf)
project on the east side of the existing Hess station, was identified. This project has the approvals to build
but has not yet been initiated. In addition, a development (Walcott Village) is proposed for a site west of
I-295 off Route 44 on the west side of the `Crossings' site. That project consists of approximately 150,000
square feet of mixed office/retail uses but the Town denied the project without it creating a shared access
with abutting commercial sites. A recent court decision upheld the Town's decision which has put the
project in an unclear status.

In addition to the above, the reuse of the former restaurant/pub on Route 44 is anticipated to be part of
the development plan was incorporated into the No-Build condition. This presumes the re-use would
occur in the future regardless of the overall development progress.

Consequently, small commercial project proposed to be adjacent to Hess was included in this analysis.
Given the uncertainty of the Walcott project, it was not specifically included in this the analysis. Peak
hour trips were generated for the above noted site-specific development using data contained in the

included in the Appendix.

3. No-Build Traffic Volumes

Consequently, the 2018 No-Build traffic volumes were determined by adding the seven (7) year
background traffic growth rate as well as traffic from the above noted developments to the existing traffic
volumes. The 2018 No-Build traffic volumes projected for the weekday morning, weekday evening and
Saturday midday peak hours at the study intersections are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.

PROPOSED PROJECT

The proposed project represents a relatively large, mixed use development on a site that abuts Route 44,
Esmond Street and I-295 as well. It is located in the northwest quadrant of the Route 44/Esmond Street
intersection. In total and based on the Master Plan dated October 20, 2011, the development consists of
approximately 149,700 sf of new floor space as summarized by category in Table 3. As can be seen, the
project includes three components including retail, restaurant and office. In addition to the items listed in
Table 4, the existing restaurant/pub building that abuts Route 44 is expected to be renovated, re-tenanted
and share common driveways with the new development.

                   ·   - not included in the table is the 7,100 sf former restaurant/pub that will be renovated and occupied as part of the
                        new project.



The site in total consists of approximately 29 acres. The project layout generally stretches north-south
with the retail components planned on the northern portion of the site fronting Esmond Street. The office
building is located in the southwestern area of the site towards Route 44 with visibility from I-395. The two
major retail buildings are proposed to front Esmond Street along with the two new restaurants and smaller
retail building. As indicated previously, the former restaurant/pub abutting Route 44 will remain as part of
the development.

The Applicant has proposed five (5) access drives to serve the project. A primary site roadway will
intersect with Route 44 approximately 300 feet west of Esmond Street and curve through the site and
connect with Esmond Street approximately 500 feet north of Route 44. This roadway is proposed to be
between 24 and 36 feet in width with a sidewalk along at least one side from beginning to end. The retail
parking field and the office building parcel can be accessed from this primary roadway from Route 44.
The primary site roadway approaches to both Route 44 and Esmond Street are proposed to have
medians to separate directional flow for a certain distance into the site. Motorists would be able to enter
and exit the site from any direction as no movements are proposed to be restricted for this primary road.
The intersections created by the new road with both Route 44 and with Esmond Street are currently
proposed by the Applicant to be unsignalized. However, the Applicant is proposing that left turn lanes be
installed on the abutting public streets at both of these two new intersections.

In addition to the primary site access road, there are three additional driveways proposed: a right in-right
out on Route 44 west of the proposed main site road; a right turn out only drive on Esmond Street
approximately 320 feet north of Route 44 and an egress only drive on Esmond Street approximately 300
feet north of the main site road intersection.

A total of 829 parking spaces are proposed including 67 spaces designated around the existing
restaurant building. Of the total spaces, 273 spaces are located in the proximity of the office building and
58 spaces are planned for the restaurant uses on Lot 2. In total, the proposed supply exceeds by a small
amount (26) what would be required by the zoning bylaw according to the Applicant.

C. SITE GENERATED TRAFFIC VOLUMES

In this section, traffic estimated to be generated by the proposed Putnam Pike Commercial Development
was estimated and assigned to roadways/intersections within the study area and added to the No-Build
traffic volume network to form the Build traffic condition.

1. Trip Generation

In order to estimate the number of trips that will be generated by the proposed development, statistics
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in Trip Generation for similar land uses were
examined. ITE trip generation statistics represent compilation of data from studies/projects throughout
the United States related to trip generation characteristics for different types of land uses and
developments.

To estimate average daily and peak hour trips for the proposed development, the ITE trip generation data
for Shopping Center (Land Use Code 820), restaurant uses (Land Use Code 932) and General Office
Building use (Land Use Code 710) were used in this study. A summary of the total estimated trip
generation is shown in Table 4.

                  Based on ITE Trip Generation


As shown in Table 4, the proposed project is expected to generate 7,318 vehicle trips on a typical
weekday and will include 3,659 entering and 3,659 exiting trips over the 24 hour period. During the AM
peak hour, it is estimated that a total of 381 vehicle trips will be generated by the development with 256
entering trips and 125 exiting trips. The weekday evening peak hour is expected to generate 808 total
trips with 362 inbound and 446 outbound trips. For a Saturday, the proposed project is estimated to
generate 8,850 vehicle trips over a 24 hour period with 4,425 entering and 4,425 exiting trips. The
Saturday midday peak hour is expected to generate 909 total trips with 475 inbound and 434 outbound
trips. It should be noted that the potential trips from the renovated 7,100 sf restaurant are included in the
Build conditions as well as the future No-Build conditions.

           More detailed information on trips generated for each of the above components is presented in Table 5.
           Detailed trip generation calculations for each individual land use are included in the Appendix. As
           indicated in Table 5 shows that the retail portion of the development represents the most significant
           generator of traffic to and from the site as would be expected.

           · passby traffic/internal capture

           In general, not all the trips generated by retail and restaurant components of a project are typically new to
           the region's roadway system. The site traffic will tend to consist of three basic trip types. One major trip
           type will be new trips generated due solely to the project. In addition, a portion of site trips will already be
           on the roadway system adjacent to the project or in close proximity to the development site and would
           likely divert to the site. Passby traffic on the adjacent streets (i.e. Route 44) to the project may turn into
           the site on impulse as well as planned trips part of the primary trip (i.e. work to home). Diverted trips
           would be made by a motorist similar to the passby trip but the motorist diverts from their normal trip path
           (i.e. from Route I-295 or Route 104). It should be noted that any existing trips diverted from I-295 or
           Route 104 for example, would be new trips to the streets abutting the project but not new vehicle trips to
           the region as a whole.

           In addition, there is the potential for some level of what is referred to as internal trips generated within the
           immediate development zone given the mix of uses. This is now referred to as internal trip capture. Due
           to the relatively small size of the individual land use components proposed, the level of internal capture is
           expected to be small and not substantively affect the analysis results. Internal capture would already be
           accounted for among retail uses based on the shopping center land use code used in developing the
           forecasts of retail related traffic. For the purposes of this analysis, no internal trip capture has been
           assumed.

                                                  5
Based on information collected by the ITE , some insight on the passby, diverted as well as internal
capture is provided. Data collected provides low to high ranges of passby rates as well as averages for a
number of uses including retail centers and restaurants. In general, office related trips are considered
"new" trips to the roadway system. From the ITE, the passby rates for shopping centers range from as
low as 8% to more than 50% during the PM peak hours with an average rate of 34% during the PM peak
hour. It generally varies by size of the center and as the center size increases, the level of passby traffic
tends to decrease as the center gains a more significant regional influence. An average rate of 26% is
indicated for the Saturday midday peak hour according to ITE. Sit down (high turnover) restaurant uses
have been observed to have an average passby rate of approximately 44% during the PM peak hours
based on a limited amount of data. RIDOT does not have any specific guidelines for application of
passby rates. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts uses a maximum of 25% passby for retail and most
commercial uses. For the purposes of this study, passby rates of 25% for retail and 30% for the sit-down
restaurants were selected.

In relation to the passby trips, Table 6 summarizes the estimated site trips with the breakdown of `new'
versus `passby'. In assigning the passby/diverted trips, it was assumed that they would primarily come
from Route 44 and I-295 but Esmond Street as well. While the passby characteristic does not affect the
amount of driveway trips, passby traffic occurrence will reduce the effective increase in traffic volumes on
the abutting streets notwithstanding the site access points.

2. Trip Distribution/Assignment

Once the number of trips projected to be generated by the development has been determined, these trips
are assigned to the site driveways and study area roadways based on trip distribution patterns
determined for the site and its individual components. Directional distribution of generated trips to and
from the site is expected to follow existing traffic patterns which, in turn, are a function of regional
population densities, shopping opportunities, areas of employment, and recreational activities.

To accomplish this, traffic flow patterns within the study area as well as access conditions relative to the
site were reviewed. The trip distribution patterns were further explored considering population densities
for the area cities and towns from the 2010 census data. The various transportation routes connecting
with the project area were identified. Trip distribution patterns for the retail component of the proposed
development was developed using a gravity type trip distribution model based on the population of
surrounding cities and towns within an approximate 15 to 30 minute driving time from the proposed center

and approximate travel times to these locations. Trip distribution for the office component of the
development as well as the passby traffic was based largely on the existing traffic patterns that tend to
reflect existing socio-economic and population characteristics as well. Figure 6 graphically displays the
results of the trip distribution analysis.

Each major project component was analyzed separately relative to trip distribution and assignment to the
roadway system given the different potential patterns and locations within the site. As stated above, the
retail and restaurant uses had new and passby trips. Additional assumptions used in developing the trip
assignments were as follows:

    ·   All five proposed site drives proposed by the Applicant were used in the base projections.

    ·   Without knowing the proposed specific tenant types, the size of the retail uses suggest a
        community/neighborhood level center although its synergy could build off the large amount of
        retail west of I-295.

    ·   The use of particular site drives considered the overall orientation of the trip by type, the
        location of the use within the site, the proposed restrictions (i.e. right turn only) and the study
        area roadway network.

3. Build Traffic Volumes

Trips that were projected for the proposed development were assigned to the site driveways and study
area roadways using the distribution percentages developed in the analysis. Peak hour site traffic
volumes were then added to the No-Build traffic volumes shown in Figures 4 and 5 to establish the
estimated 2018 Build condition traffic volume network. Figures 7 to 9 present the Build traffic volume
network for the weekday morning and evening, and the Saturday midday peak hours, respectively.

D. ANALYSIS

This traffic and transportation study focused on the analysis of various roadways and intersections
identified previously within the study area. Previous sections of this report discussed the current
transportation system and the development of the 2018 No-Build and Build traffic volume networks.

Included in this section is an examination of the incremental increases in traffic expected on study area
roadways under Build conditions, and the capacity/Level of Service (LOS) analysis for the study
intersections under existing and future conditions.

1. Traffic Volume Increases

A comparison of the No-Build and Build network peak hour traffic volumes was initially completed as part
of the analysis. Table 7 summarizes these increases in traffic volumes for the study area roadways. The
comparison indicated that the proposed development will result in measurable traffic volume increases on
the area roadway system with the largest increases along Esmond Street between the Site and Route 44.

The comparison resulted in the following noted:

    ·   In general, the magnitude and relative effect of the traffic increases will be larger on Saturday
        as the project is expected to generate more trips on Saturday than on a typical weekday
        (particularly the AM peak period).

    ·   Esmond Street between the site drive and Route 44 will experience a large increase in
        volume due to the proposed access points and having the traffic signal at Route 44 to
        facilitate left turns (motorists returning) back to the east. The left turns from Esmond Street
        onto Route 44 are estimated to increase from 47 to 58 vehicles during the existing weekday
        peak hours to between 115 to 248 vehicles under Build conditions.

    ·   Route 44 east of Esmond Street is estimated to experience increases of between 11.5% and
        17.6% depending on the peak period. Increases will be greatest on Saturday with the peak
        generation occurs.

    ·   Assuming no diversion occurs due to additional congestion on Route 44, it is estimated that
        relatively small increases in traffic flow would occur on Dean Avenue and on Sibille Road.
        This presumes that site traffic can travel on and off Route 44 with manageable delays and
        levels of difficulty thereby not encouraging above anticipated use of these streets.

           2. Capacity/Level of Service (LOS) Analysis

           The key part of this analysis involved the study intersections being examined with regard to flow rates,
           capacity and delay characteristics to determine the Level of Service (LOS) provided under existing and
           future (No-Build and Build) traffic conditions. Level of Service is an indicator of operating conditions
           which occur on a given roadway feature while accommodating varying levels of traffic volumes. It is a
           qualitative measure that accounts for a number of operational factors including roadway geometry, speed,
           traffic composition, peak hour factors, travel delay, freedom to maneuver and driver expectation. When
           all of these measures are assessed and a Level of Service is assigned to a roadway or intersection, it is
           equivalent to presenting an "index" to the operational qualities of the section under study.

                                                                                                            6
           Level of Service is classified in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (2000 HCM) into six levels that are
           designated `A' through `F' based on the control delay ranges they fall under. These are presented in
           Table 8 for both unsignalized and signalized intersections. In practice, any given roadway/intersection
           may operate at a wide LOS range depending upon time of day, day of week or period of year. It should be
           noted that for unsignalized intersections, the Level of Service is not computed for the intersection as a
           whole. Instead the level of service is determined by the computed or measured control delay for each
           individual critical movement. Table 9 presents criteria related to the weave analysis that is based on
           vehicle density and speeds. It should be noted that available analysis methods for weaving are focused
           on freeway type segments and given that the section under study is a major arterial with lower than
           freeway speeds, the results must be tempered somewhat but nonetheless, the results provide some
           insight as to the condition and how it could change.

           The study intersection was evaluated as per techniques published in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual.

established in the HCM based on control delay, was used to analyze the study intersections. The HCS
software was used to gain insight related to the weaving between I-295 NB off-ramp and Esmond Street.
Using existing roadway features and intersection controls traffic operations at the study area intersections
were evaluated for existing as well as future conditions with and without the Putnam Pike Commercial
Development. Analysis results for the above are presented in Tables 10 - 12 for the study intersections.
The weave analysis results are summarized in Table 13.

The Level of Service analysis indicated that:

    ·   Without the development, the signalized intersection of Route 44 and Esmond Street is
        computed to operate at generally acceptable overall conditions (LOS'C' or higher) under each
        analysis period. However, during the afternoon peak period and Saturday as well, there is an
        issue with the eastbound left turn movement where the vehicle queue exceeds the capacity
        of the defined left turn lane. Vehicles tend to extend into the center TWLTL. In addition, the
        curb cut activity in relation to the Hess facility is not necessarily reflected in the analysis
        results.

    ·   The Esmond Street intersection with Dean Avenue operates under 4-way STOP control and
        during the afternoon peak period, the northbound approach exhibits a LOS `F' that affects the
        overall condition as well. This condition continues through the future No-Build and Build
        scenarios

      ·     In an overall sense, the two study intersections are estimated to operate at acceptable levels
            of service during the AM peak hour under existing and future No-Build conditions. However,
            the Esmond Street southbound right turn lane to Route 44 is a high volume movement and
            the vehicle queue exceeds the capacity of that lane. Under Build conditions, the similar
            characteristics are anticipated at the two intersections. While the majority of site traffic is
            entering the site during the AM peak hour, any motorist exiting the site and turning left onto
            Route 44 (Drive B) will experience very long delays (LOS `F').

      ·     During the weekday PM peak hour, the constraints in the network become more apparent. At
            the Route 44 signal with Esmond Street, the eastbound left turn operates at a LOS `F' with
            insufficient capacity and queue length storage. In the No-Build condition, the overall
            intersection congestion level is at 0.94 with the EB left turn queue length estimated at over
            530 feet where the designated turn lane storage is 230 feet. The spillover occurs in the center
            TWLTL rather than into the through movement lanes, however, this is not the intent of the
            center TWLTL and the queue can affect motorists exiting sites along the north side of the
            street. Also during the PM period, the ALL WAY STOP intersection of Esmond Street with
            Dean Avenue becomes more congested, particularly related to the northbound movement.


      ·     Under Build conditions during both the PM peak hour and the Saturday midday peak hour,
            the analysis has shown that without any major improvements to the abutting network, the
            Route 44/Esmond Street intersection will operate at very low or failing levels of service as will
            the Esmond Street/Dean Avenue intersection. In addition, the unsignalized site drive
            intersections where one would be allowed to exit and turn left, motorists will experience long
            delays and poor levels of service.

      ·     Under Build conditions, the analysis also showed the added traffic due to the development
            results in:




Proposed PPCD, Traffic Study, Smithfield, Rhode Island                                                                                                                                                         Page 30
           The Esmond Street southbound left turn at Route 44 becomes over capacity during
           the weekday PM Peak and Saturday midday peak hours with low levels of service
           and long vehicle queues.
           The Esmond Street southbound right turn lane vehicle queue continues to extend
           beyond the 130 foot turn lane.
           The eastbound left turn vehicle queue on Route 44 at the Esmond Street signal is
           estimated to exceed 620 feet during the afternoon peak period.
           Traffic exiting the site and trying to turn left onto Esmond Street during the weekday
           afternoon peak hour and the Saturday peak hour will experience long delays (LOS
           `E' or `F') although physical capacity exists on Esmond Street to accommodate the
           added volume. With the added volume as well as the site's primary road proposed
           to be located opposite Julien Street, it will become more difficult to exit and turn left
           onto Esmond Street from the existing residential street.
           While the weave analysis method is not an exact application for an arterial route, it
           does provide some indication of the impact the project will have. The analysis
           indicates that the weaving that takes place on Rotue 44 eastbound between the I-
           295 NB off-ramp and Esmond Street will worsen by a level of service ­ during the
           PM peak hour as a result of the project.

Based on the analysis results as well as a review of the Applicant's proposed access plan it becomes
apparent that improvements are required in order to provide efficient and safe access/egress for the
development while reducing its impact on the surrounding street system. A number of possible actions
were identified for consideration by the Town if the project is approved and these are discussed in the
final report section.

5. Traffic Signal Warrants Analysis

As part of the study scope developed by the Town, a signal warrant analysis was performed for the
Esmond Street/Dean Avenue intersection in accordance with the procedures and criteria described in the
manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Traffic signal warrants have been developed over
the years to guide the analyst in determining whether or not a traffic signal should be installed at a
particular location. The warrants relate to volumes, safety and other factors as defined in the MUTCD. It
should be noted that care and judgment needs to be taken in any decision related to installing new
signals and simply satisfying one or more of the warrant criteria does not mean that a traffic signal must
be installed. There are currently nine (9) warrants defined but the most relevant warrants for this study
are the first three volume warrants. These are briefly described below.

·   Warrant 1, Eight Hour Vehicular Volume

In order to meet the warrant, vehicle volume in each of any eight (8) hours of an average day, on the
major street in both directions and the high minor street approach should be the following:

A. No. of Approach Lanes                                 Volume
   Major street (1)/minor street (1)                     major street (500)/minor street (150)
   Major street (2 or more)/minor street (1)             major street (600)/minor street (150)
   Major street (2 or more)/minor street (2)             major street (600)/minor street (200)
   Major street (1)/minor street (2 or more)             major street (500)/minor street (200)


Proposed PPCD, Traffic Study, Smithfield, Rhode Island                                                 Page 31
B. No. of Approach Lanes                                 Volume
   Major street (1)/minor street (1)                     major street (750)/minor street (75)
   Major street (2 or more)/minor street (1)             major street (900)/minor street (75)
   Major street (2 or more)/minor street (2)             major street (900)/minor street (100)
   Major street (1)/minor street (2 or more)             major street (750)/minor street (100)

Criteria are generally reduced to 70% if travel speeds are above 40 miles per hour but this does not apply
in this specific situation.

·   Warrant 2, Four Hour Vehicular Volume

Vehicular volumes per hour each of any four (4) hours of an average day on major street in both
directions and minor street in one direction (with higher volume) are plotted on a standard graph provided
in MUTCD. If the intersecting point falls above the respective curve in terms of number of approach
lanes, the warrant is met.

·   Warrant 3, Peak Hour

Vehicular volumes one (1) hour of any average weekday on major street in both direction and minor
street in one direction (with higher volume) are plotted on a standard graph provided in MUTCD. If the
intersecting point falls above the respective curve in terms of number of approach lanes, the warrant is
met.

The result of analysis, which was based on current volumes, is summarized in Table 14. As shown, the
Warrant 1A criteria is not met for any hours and only 4 hours for Warrant 1B. It should be noted that the
volumes on the Dean Avenue westbound approach to the intersection exceed the 75 vehicle minimum
criteria for more than 8 hours. However, the major street flow remains below the minimum criteria for all
but 4 hours. As volumes increase along Esmond Street in the future, particularly if the development
project is built, there is an increasing chance that the minimum volumes under Warrant 1B for Esmond
Street would be satisfied.

The charts for Warrants 2 and 3 are included in the Appendix.

As the analysis has shown, that under current traffic volume conditions, traffic signals at the Esmond
Street intersection with Dean Avenue are not warranted as defined in the MUTCD.

In addition to the Esmond Street intersection with Dean Avenue, the site drive intersections were also
reviewed relative to the potential need and justification for traffic signals. Based on the proposed access
plan developed by the Applicant and the estimated peak hour traffic flows developed as part of this study,
it was concluded that the minimum volume warrant criteria would not be satisfied although motorists
exiting the site and turning left onto both Route 44 or Esmond Street during the peak times would
experience long delays. The potential application of traffic signals was revisited in the evaluation of
modifying the access plan for the proposed development and this is described in a later section.

6. Site Plan Access Review

The proposed site plan submitted by the Applicant as part of the Master Plan process was reviewed in
terms of traffic flow, access and general transportation planning guidelines. The review resulted in the
following being noted:

    ·   Proposed project has five (5) driveways shown with two on Route 44 and three along
        Esmond Street that is, in general, more drives than are necessary to meet the estiamted
        demands of the project.

    ·   In addition to providing more driveways than are required, the distances between the site
        drives range from less than 200 feet to approximately 300 feet.

    ·   Two of the driveways are located approximately 300 feet from the Route 44 intersection
        with Esmond Street, which given the existing operating conditions of the intersection,
        providing less than desirable separation.

    ·   The internal parking layout for half the parking lot in front of the retail buildings is not



Proposed PPCD, Traffic Study, Smithfield, Rhode Island                                                  Page 33
        oriented in a normal manner where the aisles typically are deigned 90 degrees to the
        building face.

    ·   While there is an internal sidewalk shown on the master plan, it ends approximately 20 to
        50 feet from Esmond Street and not proposed to connect with the abutting
        neighborhoods.

    ·   The mitigation/access plan proposed by the Applicant includes widening Route 44 and
        the southern portion of Esmond Street to allow for a double left turn lane in the eastbound
        direction approaching Esmond Street. A preliminary analysis of this action shows that
        providing the double left turn lane would improve the overall level of service from LOS `E'
        or LOS `F' to LOS `C' during the PM peak or Saturday midday peak hours. The left turn
        queue in the eastbound direction would be substantially reduced under this option with
        the Saturday midday peak hour 95th percential queue reduced to 230 feet.

        While this improves the level of service and reduces the left turn vehicle queuing, it
        requires widening on both Route 44 and Esmond Street. Not enough detail was provided
        by the Applicant to determine the feasibility of this action with respect to the layout and
        physical requirements and the effect on the access to existing commerical properties
        located at the intersection. The widening on Esmond Street as shown by the Applicant
        and would likely be required under this scenario to extend somewhat beyond the site's
        major drive on Esmond Street in order to accommodate the lane drop and vehicle
        merging.

Conclusions/Recommendations
The focus of this study has been to develop a more thorough understanding of the traffic impacts of the
proposed commercial development to be located off Route 44 at Esmond Street. The preceding sections
have described the data, methods, assumptions and results in detail. Existing issues in the project area
that affect traffic flow operations include the high eastbound left turn volume; the active driveways at the
intersection; the high volumes on Route 44; and the distance between the I-295 ramps and the signal at
Esmond Street.

The proposed project is estimated to add a substantial amount of new traffic to the abutting roadway
system, particularly during the weekday afternoon peak hours and on Saturday. The above noted issues
become more pronounced as well as the study intersections begin to operate at lower or poor levels (LOS
`E' or `F') of service as a result of the development and without mitigating actions. The key findings from
the analysis are as follows:

        The level of service analysis showed that the overall operating conditions of the two study
        intersections including the Route 44 intersection with Esmond Street were currently
        operating at generally acceptable peak hour levels. Although this specific section of
        Route 44 is less intensely developed than the west side of the highway and despite the
        overall LOS findings, there are issues that exist in the study section that affect the actual
        efficiency and safety of the traffic flow at this location. Most notable, these include the
        high volume movement between Route 44 and Esmond street, the inadequately
        designated exclusive turn lanes and the short distance between the I-295 NB off-ramp
        and the Esmond Street intersection.

        With the development project and no major improvements, the operating levels of the two
        study intersections reduce to LOS `E' or LOS `F' during the weekday afternoon or
        Saturday midday peak hours.

        The weaving that occurs between the highway off-ramp and intersection is high and
        results in a low level of service particularly during the afternoon peak hour worsening with
        the proposed project.

        In relation to the proposed site plan including its layout and proposed drives, there were a
        number of issues or questions noted in the previous report section. Most notably were the
        5 proposed drives to serve the development which is more than needed and the proximity
        of the drives to the Route 44/Esmond Street intersection. These and the other site design
        items should be addressed going forward.

Potential Mitigation/Access Actions

As indicated previously, the focus of this study was determining the potential effect of the development as
a whole on the abutting street system. The analysis has shown that improvements and/or modifications to
the project's access plan are required to accommodate safe access/egress and to reduce the impact on
traffic flow on Esmond Street and Route 44 in the project area. However, there are a number of different
actions that could be considered if development advances many of which relate to improved access

management. These include but should not be limited to the following:

The Applicant's engineers proposed in the preliminary traffic plan that a second left turn lane be added to
Route 44 eastbound at Esmond Street. This action requires widening on both Route 44 and Esmond
Street. Not enough detail was provided by the Applicant to determine the feasibility of this action with
respect to the layout and physical requirements. Operationally, the double left turn lane will result in
improve overall level of service during the PM peak hour to LOS `C' and the estimated maximum vehicle
queue would be reduced to approximately 230 feet.

Access Management

In considering transportation improvement alternatives, the overall concept of `access management' was
taken into account. Access management focuses on preserving the transportation resource in this case ­
Route 44 and to a lesser degree, Esmond Street. As defined by the Transportation Research Board
       7
(TRB), "the purpose of access management is to provide vehicular access to land development in a
manner that preserves the safety and efficiency of the transportation system ".

A major part of access management is locating and designing access to adjoining properties. Inadequate
corridor access management has potentially significant negative impacts particularly as the corridor
volumes increase, access to abutting properties becomes more intense and the ability to implement major
improvements become limited. Studies have indicated that as crash experience and congestion
increases on a roadway, in part due to poor access management, motorists are likely to divert to other
routes or avoid the particular section in question altogether. This in turn will tend to negatively impact
long term economics for the businesses located in the area while also potentially shifting traffic to other
less desirable routes. Typical characteristics that have led to poor operating conditions, higher potential
for incidents, and less than ideal accessibility include excessive number of driveways, too many drives
per land use and the lack of or over control within a section of road. Over the years, these characteristics
have become more prevalent along Route 44 between Route 5 and Dean Avenue in Smithfield.

Access management attempts to balance the movement of traffic with the access needs of the abutting
land uses. Access Management tools include policies, design guidelines and regulations and highway
design features. Some of the key principles of access management include the following:

              ·   limit direct access to the major roadway
              ·   locate signals to favor through movements
              ·   preserve the functional areas of intersections
              ·   limit the number of conflict points
              ·   remove turning vehicles from through traffic lanes
              ·   use non-traversable medians to control left turn movements
              ·   provide supporting street and circulation system

Implementing corridor access management systems can, however, become complicated and difficult
given the different types of land uses and areas that a street may exist within and the different functions
one roadway may need to serve and the level of development that is present. Retrofitting an existing

corridor will have different obstacles than a new roadway corridor or an existing corridor where land has
yet to be highly developed.

At this time, neither the Town of Smithfield nor RIDOT has a Corridor Access Management Plan in place
for specifically Route 44. The Town has developed access plans for several other corridors in the
community. As indicated previously, Route 44 is owned and controlled by RIDOT. Consequently, all new
access points and major changes to existing land uses require RIDOT approvals. However, that does not
preclude the Town from developing and implementing a strong access management plan for the corridor.
In this situation, the Town must work closely with RIDOT to achieve the results. A local access
management plan for Route 44 in relation to the proposed development could consist of the following
elements:

    ·   Reducing the number of driveways serving the project. An alternative would be one major
        drive on Route 44 and one major drive on Esmond Street.

    ·   The two driveways should be at least 500 feet away from the Route 44/Esmond Street
        intersection.


    ·   Unless the Site's main roadway on Route 44 is controlled by a signal, consideration
        should be given to providing a right in/right out only drive with a barrier placed on Route
        44 to prevent left turns being made in or out of the site. To reverse direction from EB to
        WB, u-turns could be made at the Esmond Street intersection.


    ·   With the above option, the EB left turn lane at the Esmond Street intersection could be
        lengthened to better accommodate the queue without affecting the EB through movement
        as well as now avoiding any conflict with traffic exiting the land uses along the north side
        of Route 44. However, this still results in an excessively long peak hour queue and poor
        operating conditions.


    ·   Given the right in/right out design of the Route 44 site drive, there will be a substantial
        amount of additional traffic on Esmond Street between the site and Route 44 creating a
        need to improve the capacity along the section of road. Widening Esmond Street
        between Route 44 and the site drive to 4 lanes in width is likely needed, however, the
        ability to do this within the layout and include shoulders and room for sidewalk has not
        been demonstrated.

                                                            rd
    ·   Another action to consider would be to create a 3 lane on Route 44 in the westbound
        direction between Esmond Street and the I-295 NB on-ramp and have it function as
        essentially a right turn auxiliary lane. This would potentially help with the
        deceleration/acceleration and weaving that exists with respect to motorists turning into
        and out of the driveways along the north side of Route 44 in this section.


    ·   Treatment at the intersection of the main site road and Esmond Street needs to be given
        more attention. The Applicant proposed a left turn lane on Esmond Street but remaining
        unsignalized. The left turns exiting the site and Julien Street (opposite site drive) would



Proposed PPCD, Traffic Study, Smithfield, Rhode Island                                                 Page 37
        experience long delays resulting in low/poor operating conditions. One option that could
        be examined would be a modern roundabout although the flow on the Julien Street
        approach is low. The roundabout option, however, would create all right turn movements
        and provide the ability to exit Julien Street with less delay. Traffic signal warrants do not
        appear to be satisfied with the project unless other changes are made to the network as
        noted below.


    ·   It may be possible and also desirable to design the site's main roadway to function more
        like a public way and provide an asset to the Town in terms of accessibility and mobility in
        this particular area. With this in mind, an alternative operational treatment would be to
        signalize the Route 44 driveway and allow all movements at this location. However, to
        potentially accomplish this, the drive would need to be at least 500 feet away from
        Esmond Street and the I-295 NB off-ramp to Route 44. The off-ramp intersection with
        Route 44 would need to be signalized also as part of this option (RIDOT would likely
        require it be relocated to the west as well in order to increase separation from the site
        drive). All of this would need to be examined in greater detail on plan as well as possibly
        computer simulation. Modifying the I-295 ramp would also require approval from Federal
        Highway. Under this plan, consideration should be given to designing the site's main road
        as a 4-lane boulevard type facility with a raised center median wide enough to support
        landscaping. Treatment at the site roadway intersection with Esmond Street/Julien Street
        would need to be developed as noted above. The three (3) signals from the ramp to
        Esmond Street would need to be coordinated. To "force" greater use of this new road,
        removing the southbound right turn lane on Esmond Street may be given consideration.
        A schematic of this concept is shown in Figure 10.

        A preliminary operations analysis of this access plan was completed for the PM peak
        hour to determine the relative merit or potential in this option providing access to the site
        and improving overall operations in this section while possibly addressing concerns along
        Esmond Street. In evaluating this option, assumptions as to the shift in turning volumes
        between Route 44 and Esmond Street via the new roadway were incorporated. Table 15
        summarizes the estimated PM peak hour levels of service for the intersections included
        in this option. The analysis showed that the overall operating conditions for the three
        signals would work at acceptable levels of service (LOS `C' or better) including the Route
        44 intersection with Esmond Street. The vehicle queuing would be reduced for the critical
        movements including the left turns from Route 44 to the north at Esmond Street. In
        addition, if the roundabout is installed at the Esmond Street intersection with the site
        roadway and Julien Street, the operting conditions would be improved with more
        balanced volumes on the approaches ­ again assuming some shifting in traffic
        movements with an emphasized new roadway through the site and connecting between
        Route 44 and Esmond Street.

  Other actions that are worth considering in relation to the traffic impact and estimated flow
  patterns/operations include:

      ·   Design internal road to accommodate transit and work with RIPTA to route bus service
          through the site along he new primary road.

      ·   Along Esmond Street, create a buffer ­ possibly with a berm ­ to reduce visual impact
          of commercial site development on nearby residential area. May also want to locate the
          small buildings along the development line rather than have parking in those locations.

      ·   Construct a sidewalk along Esmond Street from Dean Avenue to connecting into the
          site's sidewalk system and continuing to Route 44 intersection. Ideally, the sidewalk
          would be located with a substantial separation (i.e. 10 feet) to enhance safety and
          increase the attractiveness of the walk.

      ·   Monitor periodically the intersection of Esmond Street with Dean Avenue to ensure
          acceptable operating conditions and if traffic signals become warranted as well as
          desired at this location.

      ·   If the objective becomes encouraging a higher direct orientation between Route 44 and
          the site, the possibility of shifting retail related uses to the southern side of the site and
          having office development located in the northern area of the site may be available.

      Notes
      a. Weaving segments longer than 2500 ft. are treated as isolated merge and diverge areas using the procedures of Chapter 25, "Ramps and Ramp
      Junctions".
      b. Capacity constrained by basic freeway capacity.
      c. Capacity occurs under constrained operating conditions.
      d. Three-lane Type A segments do not operate well at volume ratios greater than 0.45. Poor operations and some local queuing are expected in
      such cases.
      e. Four-lane Type A segments do not operate well at volume ratios greater than 0.35. Poor operations and some local queuing are expected in
      such cases.
      f. Capacity constrained by maximum allowable weaving flow rate: 2,800 pc/h (Type A), 4,000 (Type B), 3,500 (Type C).
      g. Five-lane Type A segments do not operate well at volume ratios greater than 0.20. Poor operations and some local queuing are expected in such
      cases.
      h. Type B weaving segments do not operate well at volume ratios greater than 0.80. Poor operations and some local queuing are expected in such
      cases.
      i. Type C weaving segments do not operate well at volume ratios greater than 0.50. Poor operations and some local queuing are expected in such
      cases.

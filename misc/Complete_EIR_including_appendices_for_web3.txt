                             ES          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ES.1 INTRODUCTION

This Environmental Impact Report (EIR) has been prepared by the City of Claremont (City) to evaluate
potential environmental effects that may result from the proposed Base Line Road 45-Unit Affordable
Housing Project (proposed project). This EIR has been prepared in accordance with the California
Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (CEQA), as amended (Cal. Pub. Res. Code, § 21000 et seq.), and
implementing State CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., Title 14, § 15000 et seq.).

ES.2 PROJECT BACKGROUND

The City of Claremont's General Plan (adopted on November 14, 2006) designates the project site as
Residential 15, for residential use with a density of fifteen units per acre. This land use designation
allows for multi-family housing. With the new General Plan, the zoning on this property was changed to
RM 3,000 as part of the state mandated zoning conformity change. The amendment to the zoning map,
adopted on July 24, 2007 and effective on August 23, 2007, modified the zoning designations of
approximately 700 parcels in the City.

The State of California requires that every city plan for and develop programs for providing its share of
regional housing needs assessment (RHNA) and identify sites in their General Plan Housing Element.
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is mandated by the state to allocate a
portion of the regional housing needs to each local jurisdiction in Southern California. The proposed
project would assist the City in meeting its current RHNA.

The proposed site was originally identified as a housing site in the 1993 Housing Element, and the
subsequent update to the Housing Element in 2001 continued to list the site as a housing site. The City's
Redevelopment Agency acquired the 2.6-acre property in 2006 with the intention to facilitate the
construction of an affordable housing project. In January 2006, the Redevelopment Agency Board
approved the facilitation of an affordable housing project on the proposed site. Following interviews of
potential developers, in August 2006, the Redevelopment Agency Board selected Enhanced Affordable
Development to develop a housing project that targets affordability at 50% and 60% of the county median
income.

An Initial Study was prepared for this project in January 2007. The Initial Study concluded that there was
substantial evidence that the project may have a significant impact on the environment in the areas of
aesthetics, air quality, geology/soils, hazards/hazardous materials, noise, public services and recreation,
and transportation/traffic (see Appendix A). Based on the Initial Study, the City determined that an
Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") would be required for the project.

Executive Summary


ES.3 PROPOSED PROJECT LOCATION AND SETTING

The proposed project is located in eastern Los Angeles County, within the City of Claremont. The
proposed site is located on Base Line Road, approximately 1000 feet east of Towne Avenue. The 2.6-
acre project site is currently vacant land except for an abandoned, circular water reservoir that is
approximately 107 feet in diameter, a few trees and low lying vegetation on the eastern portion of the site,
and a Southern California Edison (SCE) overhead power line that borders the site to the south and bisects
the site east of the water reservoir. Site topography is flat with no obvious slope. The property was
previously disturbed from being used as a strawberry field, but is no longer in production.

The Foothill Freeway (I-210) is directly south of the project site, approximately 26 feet below the project
site grade; to the west of the site is vacant land currently being used as a strawberry field; a SCE
substation is located adjacent to the site to the east; and single-family homes are located east of the SCE
substation. Other surrounding land uses include single-family homes to the north, across Base Line Road,
in the City of Claremont and unincorporated Los Angeles County.

ES.4 PROPOSED PROJECT SUMMARY

The proposed project would provide 45 units of affordable townhouses with garages, guest parking, a
recreation area, pool, and an office and recreation room. The City anticipates the townhouses would be
leased as rental units. As stated in the Initial Study, the proposed project would ultimately house
approximately 138 new residents. A walkway would provide access around the project site and allow
access to the townhouses and recreation area. A seven-foot wall would be built along the southern
boundary with I-210 in accordance with the California Department of Transportation materials
requirements.

The goal of the proposed project is to provide affordable housing to meet the needs of the community.
The primary project objectives that have been identified in support of this goal include:

    1. Develop at least 45 units of low and very-low income housing units;

    2. Create a project that can be built quickly to meet the City's share of regional housing needs
       assessment;

    3. Construct an affordable housing project on land with a General Plan designation that allows for
       residential use, thereby preserving the City's limited commercial and industrial lands; and

    4. Encourage the development of affordable housing that is distributed throughout the City to create
       economically diverse neighborhoods, as stated in Housing Element Goal 8-3.

                                                                                                City of Claremont
                                                                                           Executive Summary


TOWNHOUSES

Up to 45 townhouses would be built in six buildings throughout the northern portion of the project site.
The buildings would include five to ten units each. There would be 18 two-bedroom units and 27 three-
bedroom units. All townhouses would include an attached two-car garage and a porch in the front of the
unit. Twelve guest parking spaces would be located on the southern portion of the site.

The buildings would primarily be two-story units. Four buildings would have one-story units on the end
of the buildings closest to the driveways, for a total of four one-story units. The height of the townhouses
would be approximately 25 feet at its maximum.

The circular water reservoir and few existing shrubs and trees would be removed in order to construct the
townhouses. New landscaping would be planted throughout the development, mainly bordering the
project site and planters, trees, and shrubs would be installed in the courtyard separating the new building
from the existing main house. A row of shrubs on the existing fence of the SCE substation would remain
in place to screen the new residences from the substation, but could require trimming to allow for
installation of the walkway.

OPEN SPACE/RECREATION AREA

An open space/recreation area would be located on the southern portion of the site adjacent to I-210 and
would include a tot lot, sport court, a pool, recreation room and office, and open space. This open
space/recreation area would be approximately 25,000 square feet. These recreation amenities would be
available to all residents and the recreation room would be available for both private and community
events. Benches, landscaping, and security lighting would be provided throughout this area. Access in
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) would be provided.

SITE ACCESS

The site would be served by two driveway locations on Base Line Road: one would be located opposite
Glen Way, and would serve the western portion of the project site; the other driveway would be located
on the eastern portion of the site. Both driveways would be located along Base Line Road. The City
would limit the easterly driveway to right turns in and out. This would eliminate the need to reconfigure
the raised median on Base Line Road and reduce the potential traffic conflicts in the area by not allowing
double left turning movements from the project site. The westerly driveway would be an unrestricted
driveway, with both left and right turns allowed to enter and exit the project site at this location.

Executive Summary


CONSTRUCTION SCENARIO

It is anticipated that construction activities would begin in September 2008 and occupancy is assumed to
be July 2009. Construction of the proposed affordable housing project would occur over a period of
approximately ten months, contingent on weather conditions suitable for construction.

The new construction would occur in one phase. Prior to any demolition, grading, or construction
activities, the construction area would be clearly defined with construction fencing and staking.
Construction staging would take place within the project site.

After the construction area is properly defined, demolition and grading operations would occur, including
demolition and removal of an abandoned, circular water reservoir that is approximately 107 feet in
diameter. First, the new driveway approach and a temporary gravel driveway in the location of the future
permanent driveway along the north side of the site would be constructed. After the demolition phase, the
temporary driveway would be used as access for the construction equipment. The construction of the
townhouses and the office and recreation room would occur prior to the open space/recreation area and
pool.

The proposed project would result in earthwork movement, which would be balanced on-site; therefore,
no import or export of fill material is anticipated. Standard diesel-powered grading equipment would be
used during earthwork and grading activities. All equipment would be maintained and operated in
compliance with applicable South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) standards.

Prior to construction, construction documents would be approved through the City of Claremont standard
permit process, including, but not limited to, review by the City's Planning, Building, Engineering, and
the Los Angeles County Fire Department. In addition, the developer would coordinate with SCE to
relocate the overhead power line to the perimeter of the project site prior to site preparation and grading
activities.

A public scoping meeting was held on February 6, 2007 for the proposed project. The scoping meeting
introduced the proposed project, outlined the environmental review process, and invited public comment
on the content of the environmental review. Approximately 20 citizens attended the meeting, and seven
people spoke at the meeting to express their concerns regarding the potential environmental effects of the
proposed project. Through this process, several key issues and areas of controversy were identified,
including:

·   Proximity of project site to a freeway could be harmful to the health of children potentially residing in
    the new complex;

·   Number of children anticipated to reside at the complex;

·   Water quality and hydrology impacts;

·   Impacts to the school district;

·   Increase in crime in the neighborhood due to the project;

·   Population density;

·   Alternate locations in the City; and

·   Review all applicable air quality studies and take into account future air quality regulations/changes.

In addition to the comments provided at the scoping meeting, several comments were received in
response to the Notice of Preparation (NOP)/Initial Study for this EIR. Copies of the comment letters are
provided in Appendix A.

ES.6 SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

An analysis of environmental impacts caused by the proposed project has been conducted and is
contained in this EIR. Seven issue areas were analyzed in detail in Chapter 3.0. Table ES-1 provides a
summary of the potential significant environmental impacts that would result during construction and
operation of the proposed project, mitigation measures that would lessen potential environmental impacts,
and the level of significance of the environmental impacts that would remain after implementation of the
proposed mitigation. The proposed project would result in significant unavoidable adverse impacts
related to Air Quality (pollutants associated with the freeway) and Noise (construction only). All other
issue areas would result in less than significant impacts, as discussed in Chapter 3.0

Executive Summary


ES.7 ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED PROJECT

The CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6 requires consideration and discussion of alternatives to the
proposed project which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid
or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project. Several alternatives, including
alternate project sites, were considered but rejected from consideration in this Draft EIR. Four
alternatives, including the No Project Alternative, are reviewed in Chapter 5 of this document. This
section summarizes alternatives to the project that were developed as well as the No Project Alternative as
required under CEQA. Table ES-2 provides a comparison of the impacts of the proposed project and the
impacts of the alternatives.

ALTERNATIVE 1 ­ NO PROJECT

Under the No Project Alternative, the proposed affordable housing development would not be constructed
and the proposed demolition activity would not occur. Because there are no other proposals that have
been submitted for the project site, no reasonably foreseeable development exists. Also, any other
proposed residential development that would be consistent with the General Plan and the Claremont Land
Use and Development Code (LUDC) would potentially have a similar proposed density of development.
Therefore, environmental characteristics would generally be the same as those described in the
environmental setting sections of Chapter 3.0.

ALTERNATIVE 2 ­ REDUCED DENSITY ALTERNATIVE (30 UNITS)

Alternative 2 would reduce the number of residential units proposed on-site from 45 (proposed project) to
30 (Alternative 2). As with the proposed project, the development would include affordable housing for
low- and very low-income residents at the project site. Alternative 2 assumes the same configuration of
buildings, driveways, internal access, sidewalks, and open space/recreation amenities as the proposed
project. This alternative would include additional guest parking spaces and open space or expand the
recreation amenities. This alternative assumes the overall footprint of the housing buildings would be
reduced and the two-story buildings would have a maximum height of 25 feet. The demolition and
removal of an abandoned, circular water reservoir would be necessary as with the proposed project.

Impacts associated with Alternative 2 would be similar to the proposed project for aesthetics, geology and
soils, hazards and hazardous materials, and noise. Alternative 2 would reduce impacts to air quality and,
public services and recreation, and transportation/traffic, but the overall significance determinations
would be the same as the proposed project in these areas. Due to the reduction in dwelling units impacts
associated with Alternative 2 would be environmentally superior to the proposed project.

ALTERNATIVE 3 ­ WEST ARROW HIGHWAY SITE

Alternative 3, 451 West Arrow Highway Site, is located in Claremont's Vista neighborhood in the
southern part of the Claremont on a 1.43-acre parcel (APN 8313-008-900) that is owned by the City's
redevelopment agency. The property is zoned CP (Commercial Professional) and has a General Plan
designation of Office Professional. A multi-family residential housing project would be permitted on this
site with a conditional use permit (CUP). Because the site is smaller than the proposed project, the
density of development would be greater than the proposed project in order to meet the project objective
of building 45 affordable housing units. The zoning density for this site is 14.5 units per acre. In order to
achieve the objective of 45 units, the City would need to grant a 117% density bonus (state law requires
that a minimum of 35% density bonus be granted) to allow the site to be developed at a density of 31.5
units per acre. The project would require the development of a minimum of three- or four-story
apartment building for low and very-low income residents. Limited recreation area could be
accommodated on property due to the limited size.

Impacts associated with Alternative 3 would be similar to the proposed project for aesthetics, geology and
soils, hazards and hazardous materials, noise, public services and recreation, and transportation/traffic.
Alternative 3 would reduce impacts to air quality because this site is not located next to a freeway and
significant unavoidable impacts associated with freeway pollutants would not occur at this alternate site.

ALTERNATIVE 4 ­ VISTA DRIVE/INDIAN HILL BOULEVARD SITE

Alternative 4, Vista Drive/Indian Hill Boulevard Site, is located in the Vista neighborhood in the southern
portion of Claremont on a 1.74-acre parcel (APN 8313-012-041). The property is zoned RM 4000 and
has a General Plan designation of Residential 15. A multi-family residential housing project would be
allowed on this site. Because the site is smaller than the proposed project, the density of development
would be greater than the proposed project in order to meet the project objective of 45 units. The zoning
density for this site is 15 units per acre. In order to achieve the objective of 45 units, the City would need
to grant an 80% density bonus (state law requires that a minimum of 35% density bonus be granted) to
allow the site to be developed at a density of 26 units per acre. The project would require the
development of a three-story apartment building for low- and very-low income residents and surface
parking. Limited recreation area could be accommodated on property due to the limited size.

Impacts associated with Alternative 4 would be similar to the proposed project for aesthetics, geology and
soils, hazards and hazardous materials, noise, public services and recreation, and transportation/traffic.
Alternative 4 would reduce impacts to air quality because this site is not located next to a freeway and
significant unavoidable impacts associated with freeway pollutants would not occur at this alternate site.

1.1      SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT

This Environmental Impact Report (EIR) has been prepared by the City of Claremont (City) to evaluate
potential environmental effects that may result from the proposed Base Line Road 45-Unit Affordable
Housing Project (proposed project). This EIR has been prepared in conformance with the California
Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (CEQA) statutes (Cal. Pub. Res. Code, § 21000 et. seq., as amended)
and implementing guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., Title 14, § 15000 et. seq., 1998).

The project site, an approximately 2.6-acre property, located approximately 1,000 feet east of Towne
Avenue, in the City of Claremont, is currently vacant with and abandoned water reservoir. The proposed
project would provide 45 affordable townhouse units and one office and recreation room building, guest
parking, and open space, consisting of recreation areas and a pool. The new townhouses would be
primarily two-story units, with four one-story units, located throughout the site in six buildings.

The project site is located on the south side of Base Line Road, on a block bound by Towne Avenue on
the west and Mountain Avenue on the east. This segment of the street is mainly characterized by single-
family residences. A Southern California Edison substation is located adjacent to the project site to the
east and the Foothill Freeway (I-210) is located along the southern boundary of the site.

1.2      THE CEQA ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS

As the lead agency under CEQA, the City has determined that an EIR is required for the proposed project.
CEQA requires the preparation of an EIR when there is substantial evidence supporting a fair argument
that a project may have a significant effect on the environment. The purpose of an EIR is to provide
decision makers, public agencies, and the general public with an objective and informational document
that fully discloses the potential environmental effects of the proposed project. The EIR process is
intended to facilitate the objective evaluation of the potentially significant direct, indirect, and cumulative
impacts of the proposed project, and to identify potentially feasible mitigation measures and alternatives
that would reduce or avoid the project's significant effects. In addition, CEQA specifically requires that
an EIR identify those adverse impacts determined to be significant after mitigation.

In accordance with the CEQA Guidelines, a Notice of Preparation (NOP) was distributed on January 29,
2007 to the Office of Planning and Research and each responsible federal and state agency, in addition to
public agencies and organizations and private organizations and individuals with a possible interest in the
project. The purpose of the NOP was to provide notification that the City planned to prepare an EIR and
to solicit input on the scope and content of the EIR. In response to the more than 400 copies of the NOP
that were distributed, 6 written comment letters were received from various agencies, organizations, and
individuals. These letters and the NOP are included in Appendix A of this EIR.

1.0 Introduction


A public scoping meeting was held on February 6, 2007 at the Claremont City Hall Council Chamber,
during a Planning Commission meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to seek input from public
agencies and the general public regarding the environmental issues and concerns that may potentially
result from the proposed project. Approximately 20 people attended the scoping meeting held on
February 6, 2007. One written comment was submitted at the meeting. A City recorder was present at
the scoping meeting to document the public comments. A transcript of the public comments and copies
of the written comment letters are included in Appendix A.

An Initial Study for the project was prepared in January 2007 and is included in Appendix A. This EIR
focuses on the environmental impacts identified as potentially significant during the Initial Study process,
including the comments received in response to the NOP and received at the public scoping meeting. The
issue areas analyzed in this EIR include aesthetics, air quality, geology/soils, hazards/hazardous materials,
noise, public services and recreation, and transportation/circulation. All issues not evaluated in detail in
Chapter 3.0 of this EIR are addressed as required by CEQA in Section 4.2, Effects Not Found to be
Significant.

This Draft EIR is being circulated for 45 days for public review and comment. The dates of the public
review period are identified in the Notice of Availability attached to this Draft EIR. During this period,
comments from the general public, organizations, and agencies regarding environmental issues raised in
the Draft EIR and the accuracy and completeness of the Draft EIR may be submitted to the lead agency at
the following address:

                         Katherine Laufenburger, Associate Planner
                         City of Claremont, Planning Division
                         P.O. Box 880
                         Claremont, CA 91711

General questions about the EIR process should also be directed to Katherine Laufenburger
(909) 399-5473 or klaufenburger@ci.claremont.ca.us. The City will prepare written responses to
comments received on the Draft EIR if they are (1) submitted in writing and postmarked to the address
above by 5:00 PM of the last day of the public review period identified in the Notice of Availability, or
(2) presented verbally at the public hearings on the Draft EIR that will be held during the public review
period. Upon completion of the public review period, a Final EIR will be prepared that will include the
comments on the Draft EIR received during the formal public review period and responses to
environmental issues raised.

Prior to considering whether to approve the proposed project, the City, as the lead agency and decision-
making entity, is required to certify that the Final EIR has been completed in compliance with CEQA,
that the proposed project has been reviewed and the information in the EIR has been considered, and that
the EIR reflects the independent judgment of the City. CEQA also requires the City to adopt "findings"
with respect to each significant environmental effect identified in the EIR (Pub. Res. Code §21081;

Cal. Code Regs., Title 14, §15091). For each significant effect, CEQA requires the approving agency to
make one or more of the following findings:

·   The project has been altered to avoid or substantially lessen significant impacts identified in the Final
    EIR.

·   The responsibility to carry out such changes or alterations is under the jurisdiction of another agency.

·   Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations, including provision of
    employment opportunities for highly trained workers, make infeasible the mitigation measures or
    project alternatives identified in the Final EIR.

If the City concludes that the proposed project would result in significant effects, which are identified in
this EIR, and that those effects would not be substantially lessened or avoided by feasible mitigation
measures and alternatives, then the City must adopt a "statement of overriding considerations" prior to
approval of the proposed project (Pub. Res. Code §21081[b]). Such statements are intended under CEQA
to provide a written means by which the lead agency balances in writing the benefits of the proposed
project and the significant and unavoidable environmental impacts. Where the lead agency concludes that
the economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits outweigh the unavoidable environmental
impacts, the lead agency may find such impacts "acceptable" and approve the project.

In addition, public agencies, when approving a project, must also adopt a mitigation monitoring and
reporting program (MMRP) describing the changes that were incorporated into the project or made a
condition of project approval in order to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment
(Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6). The MMRP is adopted at the time of project approval and is intended to
ensure compliance during project implementation. Upon approval of the proposed project, the City would
be responsible for the implementation of the proposed project's MMRP.

1.0 Introduction


Chapter 1 of this EIR provides a brief description and purpose of the proposed project. It includes an
overview of the CEQA environmental review process and a section describing the organization of the
EIR.

Chapter 2 of this EIR provides a detailed description of the proposed project. Project objectives are
identified, and information on the project characteristics, conceptual project design, and construction
scenario is provided. This section also includes a description of the intended uses of the EIR and public
agency actions.

Chapter 3 of this EIR describes the potential environmental effects of implementing the proposed
project. The discussion in Chapter 3 is organized by seven environmental issue areas, as follows:

·    Aesthetics                                           ·   Noise

·    Geology and Soils                                    ·   Transportation/Circulation

·    Hazards and Hazardous Materials

For each environmental issue in Chapter 3, the analysis and discussion is organized into five subsections
as described below:

·    Environmental Setting ­ This subsection describes, from a local and regional perspective, the physical
     environmental conditions in the vicinity of the proposed project at the time of publication of the NOP.
     The environmental setting establishes the baseline conditions by which the City will determine
     whether specific project-related impacts are significant.

·    Regulatory Setting ­ This subsection provides a summary of the federal, state, and local regulatory
     parameters pertinent to each topic area as established at the time of publication of the NOP.

·    Environmental Impact Analysis

     o     Significance Criteria ­ This subsection identifies a set of criteria for determining whether an
           impact would be considered significant.

     o     Impacts Discussion ­ This subsection provides detailed information on the environmental effects
           of the proposed project during construction and operational phases, and whether the impacts of
           the proposed project would meet or exceed the established significance criteria.

·    Mitigation Measures ­ This subsection identifies potentially feasible mitigation measures that would
     avoid or substantially reduce significant adverse project-related impacts.

·   Significance After Mitigation ­ This subsection identifies any residual significant and unavoidable
    adverse effects of the proposed project that would result even after the mitigation measures have been
    implemented.

Chapter 4 of this EIR presents the other mandatory CEQA sections, including the following:

·   Unavoidable Significant Adverse Impacts ­ This subsection identifies and summarizes the
    unavoidable significant impacts described in detail in Chapter 3.

·   Effects Not Found to Be Significant ­ This subsection identifies and summarizes the environmental
    impacts that were determined to have no adverse environmental effect or less than significant
    environmental effect, given the established significance criteria.

·   Cumulative Impacts ­ This subsection addresses the potentially significant cumulative impacts that
    may result from the proposed project when taking into account related or cumulative impacts
    resulting from other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects.

·   Irreversible Environmental Changes ­ This subsection addresses the extent to which the proposed
    project would result in the commitment of nonrenewable resources.

·   Growth-Inducing Impacts ­ This subsection describes the potential of the proposed project to induce
    economic or population growth or the construction of additional housing, either directly or indirectly,
    in the surrounding environment.

Chapter 5 of this EIR describes and evaluates the comparative merits of the three alternatives to the
proposed project that would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the proposed project and avoid
or substantially lessen potentially significant project-related impacts. The chapter also describes the
preliminary site constraints analysis and rationale for selecting the range of alternatives discussed in the
EIR and identifies the alternatives considered by the City that have been rejected from further evaluation.
Chapter 5 also includes a discussion of the environmental effects of the No Project Alternative and
identifies the environmentally superior alternative.

1.4        AREAS OF CONTROVERSY

A public scoping meeting was held on February 6, 2007 for the proposed project. The scoping meeting
introduced the proposed project, outlined the environmental review process, and invited public comment
on the content of the environmental review. Approximately 20 citizens attended the meeting, and seven
people spoke at the meeting to express their concerns regarding the potential environmental effects of the
proposed project. Through this process, several key issues and areas of controversy were identified,
including:

·    Proximity of project site to a freeway could be harmful to the health of children potentially residing in
     the new complex;

·    Impacts to public services;

·    Safety of children walking to school;

·    Inadequate parking;

·    Excessive noise;

·    Inclusion of environmental justice within the EIR;

·    Number of children anticipated to reside at the complex;

·    Water quality and hydrology impacts;

·    Impacts to the school district;

·    Increase in crime in the neighborhood due to the project;

·    Population density;

·    Alternate locations in the City; and

·    Review all applicable air quality studies and take into account future air quality regulations/changes.

In addition to the comments provided at the scoping meeting, several comments were received in
response to the NOP/Initial Study for this EIR. Copies of the comment letters are provided in Appendix

                               2         PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This chapter describes the project location and setting, the project background, the objectives of the
project, the project components and construction requirements, the intended uses of the EIR, project
approvals required, and a list of related projects. This information is provided pursuant to the CEQA
Guidelines, Section 15124.

2.1      PROJECT LOCATION AND SETTING

The proposed project is located in eastern Los Angeles County, within the City of Claremont (see Figure
2-1). As shown on Figure 2-2, the proposed site is located on Base Line Road, approximately 1000 feet
east of Towne Avenue. The 2.6-acre project site is currently vacant land except for an abandoned,
circular water reservoir that is approximately 107 feet in diameter, a few trees and low lying vegetation on
the eastern portion of the site, and a Southern California Edison (SCE) overhead power line that borders
the site to the south and bisects the site east of the water reservoir. Site topography is flat with no obvious
slope. The property was previously disturbed from being used as a strawberry field, but is no longer in
production.

The Foothill Freeway (I-210) is directly south of the project site, approximately 26 feet below the project
site grade, to the west of the site is vacant land currently being used as a strawberry field, a SCE
substation is located adjacent to the site to the east, and single-family homes are located east of the SCE
substation. Other surrounding land uses include single-family homes to the north, across Base Line Road,
in the City of Claremont and unincorporated Los Angeles County.

No schools are located within one-quarter mile of the project site. However, there are four schools located
less than one mile from the project site: Summer/Danbury Elementary School (1770 Summer Avenue),
located approximately 0.60 mile southwest of the site; Condit Elementary School (1750 Mountain
Avenue), located approximately 0.5 mile southeast of the site; Claremont High School (1601 North
Indian Hill Boulevard), located approximately 0.80 mile southeast of the site; and Webb School
(1175 West Baseline Road), located approximately 0.30 mile northwest of the site. All of the schools are
part of the Claremont Unified School District, except for the Webb Schools, which are private collegiate
preparatory high schools.

2.0 Project Description


2.2        PROJECT BACKGROUND

The City of Claremont's General Plan (adopted on November 14, 2006) designates the project site as
Residential 15, for residential use with a density of fifteen units per acre. This land use designation
allows for multi-family housing. With the new General Plan, the zoning on this property was changed to
RM 3,000 as part of the state mandated zoning conformity change. The amendment to the zoning map,
adopted on July 24, 2007 and effective on August 23, 2007, modified the zoning designations of
approximately 700 parcels in the City.

The State of California requires that every city plan for and develop programs for providing its share of
regional housing needs assessment (RHNA) and identify sites in their General Plan Housing Element.
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is mandated by the state to allocate a
portion of the regional housing needs to each local jurisdiction in Southern California. The proposed
project would assist the City in meeting its current RHNA.

The proposed site was originally identified as a housing site in the 1993 Housing Element, and the
subsequent update to the Housing Element in 2001 continued to list the site as a housing site. The City's
Redevelopment Agency acquired the 2.6 acre property in 2006 with the intention to facilitate the
construction of an affordable housing project. In January 2006, the Redevelopment Agency Board
approved the facilitation of an affordable housing project on the proposed site. Following interviews of
potential developers, in August 2006, the Redevelopment Agency Board selected Enhanced Affordable
Development to develop a housing project that targets affordability at 50% and 60% of the county median
income.

2.3        PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The goal of the proposed project is to provide affordable housing to meet the needs of the community.
The primary project objectives that have been identified in support of this goal include:

     1. Develop at least 45 units of low and very-low income housing units;

     2. Create a project that can be built quickly to meet the City's share of regional housing needs
        assessment;

     3. Construct an affordable housing project on land with a General Plan designation that allows for
        residential use, thereby preserving the City's limited commercial and industrial lands; and

     4. Encourage the development of affordable housing that is distributed throughout the City to create
        economically diverse neighborhoods, as stated in Housing Element Goal 8-3.

2.4      PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS

The proposed project would provide 45 units of affordable townhouses with garages, guest parking, a
recreation area, pool, and an office and recreation room. The City anticipates the townhouses would be
leased as rental units. As stated in the Initial Study, the proposed project would ultimately house
approximately 138 new residents.1,2 A walkway would provide access around the project site and allow
access to the townhouses and recreation area. A seven-foot, masonry wall would be built along the
southern boundary with I-210 in accordance with the California Department of Transportation materials
requirements. The primary components of the projects are described below and are illustrated on Figure
2-3, Site Plan.


2.4.1 TOWNHOUSES

Up to 45 townhouses would be built in six buildings throughout the northern portion of the project site.
The buildings would include five to ten units each. There would be 18 two-bedroom units and 27 three-
bedroom units. All townhouses would include an attached two-car garage and a porch in the front of the
unit. Twelve guest parking spaces would be located on the southern portion of the site.

Figure 2-4, Elevations, shows the proposed townhouses and their key exterior features. As shown on the
elevations, the structures would primarily be two-story units. Buildings 2, 3, 5, and 6 would have one-
story units on the end of the buildings closest to the driveways, for a total of four one-story units. The
height of the townhouses would be approximately 25 feet at its maximum.

The few existing shrubs and trees would be removed in order to construct the townhouses. New
landscaping would be planted throughout the development, mainly bordering the project site and planters,
trees, and shrubs would be installed in the courtyard separating the new building from the existing main
house. A row of shrubs on the existing fence of the SCE substation would remain in place to screen the
new residences from the substation, but could require trimming to allow for the installing of the walkway.


2.4.2 OPEN SPACE/RECREATION AREA

An open space/recreation area would be located on the southern portion of the site adjacent to I-210
includes a tot lot, sport court, a pool, recreation room and office, and open space (see Figure 2-3). This
open space/recreation area would be approximately 25,000 square feet. These recreation amenities would
be available to all residents and the recreation room would be available for both private and the proposed

  The project number of residents for the proposed project is comparable to the Vista Valle development in Claremont, which is a
similar development with 48 two- and three- bedroom units that are 100 percent affordable, and with income restrictions similar
to the proposed project. In August 2006, the Vista Valle development had a total of 138 residents.

project's community events. Benches, landscaping, and security lighting would be provided throughout
this area. Access in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) would be provided.

2.4.3 SITE ACCESS

The site would be served by two driveway locations on Base Line Road, one which would be located
opposite Glen Way, and would serve the western portion of the project site, and the other which would be
located on the eastern portion of the site (see Figure 2-3). Both driveways would be located along Base
Line Road. The City would limit the easterly driveway to right turns in and out. This would eliminate the
need to reconfigure the raised median on Base Line Road and reduce the potential traffic conflicts in the
area by not allowing double left turning movements from the project. The westerly driveway would be an
unrestricted driveway, with both left and right turns allowed to enter and exit the project site at this
location.

2.5        CONSTRUCTION SCENARIO

It is anticipated that construction activities would begin in September 2008 and occupancy is assumed to
be July 2009. Construction of the proposed affordable housing project would occur over a period of
approximately ten months, contingent on weather conditions suitable for construction.

The new construction would occur in one phase. Prior to any demolition, grading, or construction
activities, the construction area would be clearly defined with construction fencing and staking.
Construction staging would take place within the project site.

After the construction area is properly defined, demolition and grading operations would occur, including
demolition and removal of an abandoned, circular water reservoir that is approximately 107 feet in
diameter. First, the new driveway approach and a temporary gravel driveway in the location of the future
permanent driveway along the north side of the site would be constructed. After the demolition phase, the
temporary driveway would be used as access for the construction equipment. The construction of the
townhouses and the office and recreation room would occur prior to the open space/recreation area and
pool. Table 2-1 lists the equipment that would likely be used to build proposed affordable housing
project during construction.

The proposed project would result in earthwork movement, which would be balanced on-site; therefore,
no import or export of fill material would be anticipated. Standard diesel-powered grading equipment
would be used during earthwork and grading activities (see Table 2-1). All equipment would be
maintained and operated in compliance with applicable South Coast Air Quality Management District
(SCAQMD) standards.

Prior to construction, construction documents would be approved through the City of Claremont standard
permit process, including, but not limited to, review by the City's Planning, Building, Engineering, and
the Los Angeles County Fire Department. In addition, the developer would coordinate with SCE to
relocate the overhead power line to the perimeter of the project site prior to site preparation and grading
activities.

2.6      INTENDED USES OF THE EIR

An EIR is a public document used by a public agency to analyze the significant environmental effects of a
proposed project, to identify alternatives, and to disclose possible ways to reduce or avoid environmental
damage (Cal. Code Regs., Title 14, §15121). As an informational document, an EIR does not recommend
approval or denial of a project. The main purpose of an EIR is to inform governmental decision makers
and the public about potential environmental impacts of a proposed project.

This EIR will be used by the City of Claremont, as the lead agency under CEQA, in making a decision
with regard to the construction and operation of the proposed 45-Unit Affordable Housing Project. The
information in this EIR will also be used by responsible agencies and other agencies with jurisdiction, as
listed below, in deciding whether to grant permits or approvals to construct or operate the proposed
project.

 3.1      AESTHETICS
The purpose of this section is to identify and evaluate visual and aesthetic resources in the project area
and to determine the degree of visual and aesthetic impacts that would be attributable to the proposed
project. The analysis describes the potential aesthetic effects of the proposed project on the existing
landscape and built environment, focusing on the compatibility of the proposed project with existing
neighborhood character and its effects on visual resources.

As discussed in the Initial Study (Appendix A), the proposed project would have less than significant
impacts related to a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista or damaging scenic resources within a
state scenic highway. Accordingly, these impacts are not evaluated further in the EIR.

3.1.1 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
VISUAL SETTING

The project site is primarily vacant land, sparsely covered with shrubs, some trees, and other low lying
vegetation. The only existing improvements are an abandoned concrete stormwater reservoir and a fenced
storage yard. The project site is surrounded by one- and two-story houses to the north across Base Line
Road, vacant land currently being used as a strawberry field to the west, a SCE substation adjacent to the
east, and single-family homes east of the SCE substation. Overhead power lines are located on the
southern perimeter of the property and bisect the western portion of the property. Figures 3.1-1 and 3.1-2
show the project site from the north side of Base Line Road. Figure 3.1-1 shows the view looking
directly south. Trees, a sound wall, and rooftops of the single-family housing on the south of I-210 are
currently viewed in the distance. Similar views are seen in Figure 3.1-2, which is looking southwest
across Base Line Road.

LIGHT AND GLARE

Claremont is largely urbanized, with many existing sources of light and glare, such as street lights,
security lighting in parking lots and along walkways, lighted recreation facilities, car headlights, and light
emitted from the interiors of buildings. Surrounding light sources nearby the project site include general
nighttime outdoor lights from single-family houses, headlight on Base Line Road and I-210, and street
and freeway lights. Currently, the segment of Base Line that the project site is located does not have
municipal street lighting in the immediate vicinity of the site. The closest street light is located at the
intersection of Town Avenue and Base Line Road. Daytime glare in the area is generally limited as
adjacent residential uses do not use reflecting surfaces on their facades. Glare is produced from
windshield reflection on I-210 during certain hours of the daytime. Nighttime glare is generally limited to
headlights reflecting off of glass surfaces as vehicles travel on I-210 and Base Line Road.

3.1.2 REGULATORY SETTING
LOCAL POLICIES

The Land Use, Community Design, and Heritage Preservation Element, of the City's General Plan,
emphasizes maintaining existing residential densities in established neighborhoods. The goals and
policies that are applicable to aesthetics are provided below:

Goal 2-2         Preserve the City's distinctive residential character by maintaining land use patterns
                 that strengthen our neighborhoods.

Policy 2-2.2     Promote neighborhood identity and conservation of individual neighborhood character.

Policy 2-2.3     Pursue code enforcement actions to advance proper maintenance of homes, buildings,
                 yards, and neighborhoods in all areas of the City.

Policy 2-2.4     Protect neighborhoods from impacts from non-residential development.

Policy 2-2.5     Prohibit the creation of gated streets.

Goal 2-5          Maintain and enhance Claremont's unique character.

Policy 2-5.1      Insist on excellence in architectural design of new construction in City.

Policy 2-11.2 Strengthen neighborhood identity with new development that is architecturally compatible
              with surrounding structures.

Policy 2-11.3 Require that new construction, additions, renovations and infill developments be sensitive
              to the neighborhood context and building forms and scale.

3.1 Aesthetics




Policy 2-11.4 Prohibit new and large structures that compromise neighborhood quality, and work with
              the Architectural Commission to study and define design issues to safeguard
              neighborhoods.

LIGHT ORDINANCE

To limit excessive light and glare, the City has included specific requirements within the Land Use and
Development Code (LUDC). Specifically, Chapter 5, Part 3, Section 533 addresses light and glare. This
section discusses standards and requirements for lighting and glare within the City, including maximum
heights of lighting fixtures; design, installation, and maintenance of lighting fixtures; standards for new
development and remodeling; lighting for parking areas; and sign illumination. The ordinance is designed
to limit light and glare to the extent feasible while providing sufficient light to safety and practicality.
Development projects are required to adhere to these requirements and standards.

3.1.3 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
In determining the level of significance, the analysis assumes design and review of construction plans of
the proposed project would comply with relevant City General Plan policies and the LUDC. This
analysis evaluates potentially adverse environmental impacts of the proposed project against the
significance thresholds for aesthetics described below.

THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

The significance of visual effects is subjective and depends on the degree of alteration, the scenic quality
of the area disturbed, and the sensitivity and number of viewers. Sensitive viewers are those who utilize
the outdoor environment or value a scenic viewpoint to enhance their daily activity. Changes in the
existing viewscape where there are no identified scenic values or sensitive viewers are considered less
than significant. The project would have a significant effect on aesthetic resources if it would result in
one or more of the following:

·   Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its surroundings; or

·   Create a new source of substantial light or glare that would adversely affect day or nighttime views in
    the area.

IMPACT ANALYSIS

VIS-1: The proposed project would not substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of
       the site and its surroundings.

As shown on the site plan (see Figure 2-3), four buildings would be visible from Base Line Road and the
single-family houses to the north of the project site. Two buildings would face Base Line Road and the
Page 3.1-4                                                          Base Line Road 45-Unit Affordable Housing EIR
                                                                                                 City of Claremont
                                                                                                 3.1 Aesthetics




side of two buildings would be visible on the western and eastern portion of the project site. The
buildings would be set back from the property line and buffered with landscaping in front of a sidewalk.
While the most notable aesthetic effect that would impact the visual character of the project site is the
change from a vacant lot to a two-story development, the proposed project would be compatible with
existing residential development in the area. Articulation of building massing and building facades is
proposed to reduce the perceived scale of the development (see Figure 2-4, Elevations). Further, the
height of the buildings would be approximately 25 feet at its maximum and is consistent with two-story
houses in the area.

All aspects of the proposed project's visual and design character would be subject to Architectural
Commission review and approval, in accordance with existing design criteria set forth in the LUDC, prior
to the commencement of any development. The Architectural Commission would review the proposed
architectural design, exterior colors, materials and details, landscaping, signage, and other design features
for compatibility and consistency with the City's design review criteria. The proposed project would not
be approved unless the development plans meet the design review criteria. Compliance with the LUDC
would ensure a less than significant impact.

VIS-2: The proposed project would not result in substantial glare that would adversely affect day or
       nighttime views in the area

The proposed project would include lighting typical of residential uses. This includes security lighting at
the recreation area, office/recreation building, and throughout the project site. The residential units would
generate sources of light and glare (windows, security lighting, etc.) that are typical of the residential
structures near the project site. Therefore, night-time illumination on the project site with development of
the proposed project is expected to be similar to the light and glare sources that currently exist in the
surrounding area. Lighting from the behind the residential units that front Base Line Road from the guest
parking areas and the recreation area would be screened from the residences to the north by the buildings
and landscaping. Consistent with City lighting requirements, as written in Chapter 5, Part 3, Section 533
of the LUDC, outdoor lighting for the proposed project would be designed, installed and maintained so
that direct rays of light are directed downward into the interior of the lot. The developer does not propose
to use large reflective surfaces such as metal or glass that would generate daytime glare. Building
materials would be typical of residential construction and produce the same amount of reflection as the
adjacent residences. The masonry block wall that on the southern boundary of the project site would
block glare form I-210 such that on-site residents would not be affected during the daytime or nighttime.
Impacts related to light and glare would be less than significant.


3.1.4 MITIGATION MEASURES
No significant impacts to aesthetics or light and glare would occur as a result of the project; therefore, no
mitigation measures are required.

3.2      AIR QUALITY
This section of the EIR addresses the impacts of the proposed project on ambient air quality and the
exposure of people, especially sensitive individuals, to unhealthful pollutant concentrations. Air
pollutants of concern include ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5),
volatile organic compounds (VOC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and greenhouse gases (GHG). This
section also analyzes the type and quantity of emissions that would be generated by the construction and
operation of the proposed project. The information in this section is, for the most part, summarized from
the technical report Air Quality Analysis, 45-Unit Affordable Housing Project, Claremont, California; the
report is attached to this EIR as Appendix B.

As discussed in the Initial Study (Appendix A), the proposed project would result in less than significant
impacts related to conflicting with or obstructing implementation of the applicable air quality plan and
violating any air quality standard or contributing substantially to an existing or projected air quality
violation. Additionally, the proposed project would not result in any construction or operational activities
that would generate objectionable odors. Therefore, these impacts are not evaluated further in the EIR.

3.2.1 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
REGIONAL CLIMATE

Air quality is affected by both the rate and location of pollutant emissions and by meteorological
conditions which influence movement and dispersal of pollutants. Atmospheric conditions such as wind
speed, wind direction, and air temperature gradients, along with local topography, provide the link
between air pollutant emissions and air quality.

The City of Claremont (City) is within the South Coast Air Basin (Basin), which consists of four counties
­ San Bernardino, Riverside, Los Angeles, and Orange ­ all of Orange County, and the non-desert
portions of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. The distinctive climate of the Basin is
determined by its terrain and geographic location. The Basin is a coastal plain with connecting broad
valleys and low hills, bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the southwest and high mountains around the rest
of its perimeter. The general region lies in the semi-permanent high pressure zone of the eastern Pacific,
resulting in a mild climate tempered by cool sea breezes with light average wind speeds. The usually
mild climatological pattern is interrupted occasionally by periods of extremely hot weather, winter
storms, or Santa Ana winds.

Winds in the project area are usually driven by the dominant land/sea breeze circulation system. Regional
wind patterns are dominated by the daytime onshore sea breezes. At night, the wind generally slows and
reverses direction traveling toward the sea. Local canyons can also alter wind direction, with wind
tending to flow parallel to the canyons.

3.2 Air Quality


An inversion layer, which is a layer of warm air that lies over cooler, ocean-modified air, often acts as a
lid, preventing air pollutants from escaping upward. In the summer, these temperature inversions are
stronger than in winter and prevent ozone and other pollutants from escaping upward and dispersing. In
the winter, a ground-level or surface inversion commonly forms during the night and traps carbon
monoxide emitted by vehicles during the morning rush hours.

EXISTING AIR QUALITY

Ambient air pollutant concentrations in Los Angeles County are measured at 18 air quality monitoring
stations operated by SCAQMD. The nearest air quality monitoring station to the project site is in
Pomona, approximately 4.7 miles southwest of the project site. As this station only monitors CO, NOx
and O3, data from the next closest air monitoring station, the Azusa monitoring station, which is about 12
miles northwest of the project site, was also used to characterize existing air quality in the project area.
The closest monitoring station which monitors SO2 is the Fontana-Arrow Highway, located about 17.6
miles east of the project site. Table 3.2-1 presents a summary of the highest pollutant values recorded at
these stations and compliance with federal and state standards from 2002 to 2006.

Carbon Monoxide (CO)

CO is a colorless and odorless gas which, in the urban environment, is associated primarily with the
incomplete combustion of fossil fuels in motor vehicles. Relatively high concentrations are typically
found near crowded intersections and along heavily used roadways carrying slow-moving traffic. Even
under the most severe meteorological and traffic conditions, high concentrations of CO are limited to
locations within a relatively short distance (300 to 600 feet) of heavily traveled roadways. Overall CO
emissions are decreasing as a result of the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program, which has mandated
increasingly lower emission levels for vehicles manufactured since 1973. Concentrations of CO are
typically higher in winter. As a result, California has required the use of oxygenated gasoline in the
winter months to reduce CO emissions. CO interferes with the transfer of oxygen to the blood. It may
cause dizziness and fatigue and can impair central nervous system functions.

Ozone (O3)

The most pervasive air quality problem in the Basin is high ground level O3 concentrations. O3 is the
principal component of smog and is formed in the atmosphere through a complex series of photochemical
reactions involving VOC and NOX, which are commonly referred to as precursors of O3 and are both
considered critical in O3 formation. NOX includes various combinations of nitrogen and oxygen,
including NO, NO2, NO3, etc. Significant O3 production generally requires about 3 hours in a stable
atmosphere with strong sunlight. O3 is a regional air pollutant because it is transported and diffused by
wind concurrent with the photochemical reaction process. Motor vehicles are the major source of O3
precursors in the Basin. During late spring, summer, and early fall, light winds, low mixing heights, and
abundant sunshine combine to produce conditions favorable for maximum production of O3. O3 causes
eye and respiratory irritation, reduces resistance to lung infection, and may aggravate pulmonary

conditions in persons with lung disease. O3 is also damaging to vegetation and untreated rubber. Control
strategies for O3 have focused on reducing emissions from vehicles, industrial processes using solvents
and coatings, and consumer products.

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)

There are two oxides of nitrogen that are important in air pollution: nitric oxide (NO) and NO2. NO,
along with some NO2, is emitted from motor vehicle engines, power plants, refineries, industrial boilers,
ships, aircraft, and railroads. NO2 is primarily formed when NO reacts with atmospheric oxygen in the
presence of VOC and sunlight; the other product of this reaction is O3, as discussed above. NO2 is the
"whiskey brown"-colored gas, more commonly known as a component of smog, readily observed during
periods of heavy air pollution. NO2 increases damage from respiratory disease and irritation and may
reduce resistance to certain infections.

Particulate Matter (PM)

Inhalable Particulate Matter (PM10)

Inhalable particulates, which are particulate matter equal to or less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10)
consists of extremely small suspended particles or droplets that can lodge in the lungs, contributing to
respiratory problems. PM10 arises from such sources as road dust from paved and unpaved roads, diesel
soot, combustion products, tire and brake abrasion, construction operations, and fires. It is also formed in
the atmosphere from NO and SO2 reactions with ammonia. PM10 scatters light and significantly reduces
visibility. Control of PM10 is primarily achieved through the control of dust at construction and industrial
sites, the cleaning of paved roads, and the wetting or paving of frequently used unpaved roads.

Inhalable particulates pose a serious health hazard, alone or in combination with other pollutants. More
than half of the smallest particles inhaled will be deposited in the lungs and can cause permanent lung
damage. Inhalable particulates can also have a damaging effect on health by interfering with the body's
mechanism for clearing the respiratory tract or by acting as a carrier of an absorbed toxic substance.
Health studies have shown a significant association between exposure to PM and premature death. Other
important effects include aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, lung disease, decreased
lung function, asthma attacks, and certain cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and irregular
heartbeat.1 Individuals particularly sensitive to fine particle exposure include older adults, people with
heart and lung disease, and children.

Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5)

Fine particles, such as those found in smoke and haze, are 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller
(PM2.5). Sources of fine particles include all types of combustion activities (motor vehicles, power plants,

wood burning, etc.) and certain industrial processes. PM2.5 is the major cause of reduced visibility (haze)
in California. Control of PM2.5 is primarily achieved through the regulation of emission sources, such as
the USEPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule and Clean Air Visibility Rule for stationary sources; the 2004
Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Rule, the Tier 2 Vehicle Emission Standards, and Gasoline Sulfur Program; or
the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Goods Movement reduction plan.

Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)

SO2 is a corrosive gas which is a combustion product from power plants and heavy industry that use coal
or oil as fuel. SO2 is also a product of diesel engine combustion. The health effects of SO2 include lung
disease and breathing problems for asthmatics. SO2 in the atmosphere contributes to the formation of
acid rain. In the Basin, there is relatively little use of coal and oil, and SO2 is of lesser concern than in
many other parts of the country.

Lead (Pb)

Pb is a stable compound that persists and accumulates both in the environment and in animals. Pb used in
gasoline anti-knock additives represents a major source of Pb emissions to the atmosphere. However, Pb
emissions have significantly decreased due to the near elimination of the use of leaded gasoline.

The criteria pollutants that are most important for this air quality impact analysis are those that can be
traced principally to motor vehicles. Of these pollutants, CO, VOC, NOX, PM10, and PM2.5 are evaluated
on a regional or "mesoscale" basis. CO is often analyzed on a localized or "microscale" basis in cases of
congested traffic conditions. Although PM10 and PM2.5 may have localized effects, there is no USEPA-
approved methodology to evaluate microscale impacts of PM10 or PM2.5. Methods for assessing localized
impacts from PM10 and PM2.5 are anticipated in the next few years.

Greenhouse Gases

Various gases in the Earth's atmosphere, classified as atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHG), play a
critical role in determining the Earth's surface temperature. Solar radiation enters the Earth's atmosphere
from space, and a portion of the radiation is absorbed by the Earth's surface. The Earth emits this
radiation back to space, but the properties of the radiation have changed from high-frequency solar
radiation, to lower-frequency infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases, which were transparent to solar
radiation, are effective in absorbing infrared radiation. This radiation that would have otherwise escaped
back to space is now "trapped," resulting in a warming of the atmosphere. This phenomenon, known as
the Greenhouse Effect, is responsible for maintaining a habitable climate. Without the Greenhouse
Effect, Earth would not be able to support life, as we now know it.

Prominent GHG contributing to the Greenhouse Effect include CO2, methane (CH4), O3, water vapor,
nitrous oxide (N2O), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Human-caused emissions of these GHG in excess
of natural ambient concentrations are responsible for an enhancement of the Greenhouse Effect, which


Base Line Road 45-Unit Affordable Housing EIR                                                      Page 3.2-5

3.2 Air Quality


have led to a trend of unnatural warming of the Earth's climate, known as global warming or global
climate change.2 Emissions of GHG contributing to global climate change are attributable in large part to
human activities associated with industrial/manufacturing, utility, transportation, residential, and
agricultural sectors.3 Emissions of CO2 are byproducts of fossil fuel combustion. CH4, a highly potent
GHG, results from off-gassing associated with agricultural practices and landfills. Processes that absorb
CO2, often referred to as sinks, include uptake by vegetation and dissolution into the ocean.

Climate change is a global problem, and GHG are global pollutants, unlike criteria air pollutants and toxic
air contaminants (TACs), which are pollutants of regional and local concern, respectively. The strong
majority of the scientific community concurs that global warming will lead to adverse climate change
effects around the globe and that the phenomenon is anthropogenic, i.e., caused by humans.4

EXISTING AIR POLLUTION SOURCES

Air quality at the project site and in the City is affected by emissions from a variety of sources. These
sources include: regional motor vehicle emissions; local motor vehicle traffic on the I-210 freeway, the
Towne Avenue freeway on and off ramps, and Base Line Road. There are no nearby commercial or
institutional sources of substantial pollutant emissions. There is an electrical distribution substation
adjacent to the project site on the east. Electromagnetic emissions from the substation are discussed in
Section 3.4 of this EIR. There are no known industrial sources located within a one-mile radius of the
project site.

SENSITIVE RECEPTORS

Some people are especially sensitive to air pollution emissions and should be given special consideration
when evaluating air quality impacts from projects. These people include children, the elderly, persons
with preexisting respiratory or cardiovascular illness, and athletes and others who engage in frequent
exercise. Structures that house these persons or places where they gather to exercise are defined as
sensitive receptors.5

Residential areas are considered to be sensitive to air pollution because residents (including children and
the elderly) tend to be at home for extended periods of time, resulting in sustained exposure to any
pollutants present. Recreational land uses are considered moderately sensitive to air pollution. Although
exposure periods are generally short, exercise places a high demand on respiratory functions, which can
be impaired by air pollution. In addition, noticeable air pollution can detract from the enjoyment of

recreation. Industrial and commercial areas are considered the least sensitive to air pollution. Exposure
periods are relatively short and intermittent as the majority of the workers tend to stay indoors most of the
time. In addition, the working population is generally the healthiest segment of the public.

Existing sensitive receptors near the project site are the residences north of the site, across Base Line
Road. Future occupants of the proposed project would also be sensitive receptors.

3.2.2 REGULATORY SETTING
FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT

The federal Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 7401-7671q) (CAA) was first enacted in 1955 and has been
amended numerous times, most recently in 1990. The CAA established federal air quality standards,
known as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), for SO2, CO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5,
and lead (Pb) and specified future dates for achieving compliance with these standards. The CAA also
mandates that each state submit and implement a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for local areas not
meeting the NAAQS. SIPs must include pollution control measures that demonstrate how the NAAQS
will be met.

CALIFORNIA CLEAN AIR ACT

The California Clean Air Act (CCAA), signed into law in 1988, requires all areas of the state to achieve
and maintain the California Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) by the earliest practical date.
Standards for most of the criteria and other pollutants have been set by the State of California. The
CAAQS tend to be more restrictive than the NAAQS and are based on even greater health and welfare
concerns. California has also set CAAQS for sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride and visibility-
reducing particles. Federal and state standards are shown in Table 3.2-2.

Regional Authority

In the Basin, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is the agency responsible for
the administration of federal and state air quality laws, regulations, and policies. SCAQMD regulations
require that any equipment that emits or controls air contaminants, such as NOX and VOC, be permitted
prior to construction, installation, or operation (Permit to Construct and Permit to Operate). The
SCAQMD is responsible for review of applications and for the approval and issuance of these permits.

Included in the SCAQMD's tasks are monitoring of air pollution, preparation of the State Implementation
Plan (SIP) for the District area, and the promulgation of its Rules and Regulations. The SIP includes
strategies and tactics to be used to attain the federal O3 standard. The SIP elements are taken from the

Executive Summary

1. The Kent Place project is proposing to develop a mix of residential and commercial uses on
a currently vacant 11.4-acre parcel of land located at the northwest corner of the intersection of
Hampden Blvd. (US 285) and University Ave. The project is anticipated to add roughly 4,100
new trips per day to the adjacent roadway network with an additional 1,340 daily pass-by trips
that are already on the existing roadway network and will divert to the site's retail uses.

2. Although the Planned Unit Development (PUD) was approved with the previously submitted
Traffic Impact Study for this site (prepared by Felsburg, Holt & Ullevig in June 2004) and
subsequent addendums and analyses performed by Fox Higgins in 2006 and 2008, this new
study was performed given changes in the land use plan and the time that has passed. This
report is intended as a stand-alone document and supersedes all previous documents and
analyses.

3. In comparison to the previously analyzed site land use plan, the current site plan represents
a reduction of just over 20% in daily trips vs. what was previously approved for the PUD.

4. A comparison of existing traffic counts vs. older data indicates that peak hour volumes on
University have remained relatively constant in recent years but thru-traffic on Hampden has
increased in the peak hours (5-20%) since 2004 when the original traffic study for this parcel
was prepared.

5. The Hampden & University intersection is operating at near capacity in the AM and PM peak
hours, with both periods calculated at LOS E. Given these traffic conditions, it is anticipated
that most future traffic growth will occur outside the existing peak hours as the morning and
evening peak hours spread to longer periods. This is typical along major urbanized corridors.
The intersection is anticipated to operate at LOS F in the PM peak hour in the short and long-
term future, with or without this project.

6. Based on the project traffic estimates, the project would add roughly 2% to the AM peak hour
and 3% to the PM peak hour entering volumes at the Hampden & University intersection.

7. To help mitigate project traffic impacts, the project proposes to construct a continuous
southbound right-turn lane and westbound right-turn lane along the project frontage. The project
proposes to extend the existing southbound right-turn lane at the Hampden & University
intersection from 100' (existing) to 450' and will extend the existing southbound left-turn lane
from 160' to 275'. This will add capacity to the Hampden & University intersection and help to
mitigate the effect of site-added traffic in the peak hours. Due to the proximity of the
intersections, the project plans for a 2" fiber interconnect between the proposed new signal and
the existing signal at Hampden & University. This will allow for the intersections to be
coordinated and will help manage queues between the intersections.

8. To further reduce delays, with or without the project, we recommend that a second
eastbound-to-northbound left-turn lane be provided to add additional capacity.           This
improvement can be implemented with restriping and minor signal modifications and can be
incorporated into the project plans. Implementation of this improvement would result in post-
project Levels of Service similar to those projected without the project.

KENT PLACE PROJECT TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY



1.0       INTRODUCTION

This traffic impact study has been prepared by the Fox Higgins Transportation Group, LLC for
the Kent Place project located at the northwest corner of the Hampden Blvd. (US 285) &
University Avenue intersection in the City of Englewood. The purpose of this study is to identify
any potential traffic impacts and to recommend traffic mitigation measures that may be needed
with development of the site as proposed. This study addresses short-term and long-term (Year
2030) traffic conditions with and without the proposed site development. Weekday AM and PM
peak hour periods were considered for site specific impacts.




2.0       PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project site is located at the northwest corner of the Hampden Blvd. (US 285) & University
Avenue intersection on the site of the old Denver Seminary. The site vicinity map is shown on
Figure 1. The project is proposing to redevelop the site with residential (multifamily rental) and
commercial land uses. Access to the site is proposed as follows:

      x   Full-movement, signalized access along University Ave. roughly 575' north of Hampden
          Blvd.

      x   Right-in, right-out only access along Hampden Blvd. located roughly 400' west of
          University Ave.

The preliminary site and access plan is shown on Figure 2. The project vicinity includes
existing commercial development to the north and residential development to the east.




3.0       EXISTING AND FUTURE BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDTIONS

3.1       Existing Circulation Network
Descriptions of the existing roadways that serve the site are presented below.

Hampden Blvd. (US 285) is a six-lane major arterial categorized as an NR-A facility (Non-
Regional Arterial) by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT). US 285 provides
east-west access locally through the study area. The posted speed limit on US 285 on the
approaches to University Ave. is 40 miles per hour (mph).




Fox Higgins Transportation Group, LLC        Page 2                               February 23, 2011
University Ave is a two-lane arterial roadway that provides north-south access through the study
area, extending from the City of Denver into Highlands Ranch. The posted speed limit on
University Ave. is 35 mph within the study area. The intersection of University Ave. with
Hampden Blvd. is controlled with a traffic signal.


3.2     Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing daily roadway traffic volumes were collected for this project in August 2010. AM and
PM peak hour turning movement volumes were collected at the Hampden Blvd. & University
Ave. intersection in December 2010. The existing daily and AM / PM peak hour traffic volumes
and lane configurations are illustrated on Figure 3.


3.3     Existing Intersection Capacity Analysis
In determining the operational characteristics of an intersection, "Levels of Service" (LOS) A
through F are applied, with LOS A indicating very good operations and LOS F indicating
congested operations. Criteria contained in the Highway Capacity Manual1 (HCM) was applied
to study area intersections using Synchro© software in order to determine existing levels of
service during peak hour periods. Additional discussion of LOS methodology is contained in the
Appendix for reference.

Intersection capacity analyses were conducted with the existing peak hour traffic volumes and
lane geometry shown on Figure 3. The intersection LOS calculation worksheets are attached in
the Appendix. The intersections LOS are summarized for each location in Table 1.

The data in the level of service summary table illustrates that, with existing peak hour volumes
and lane geometry, the Hampden Blvd. & University Ave. intersection is currently operating at
LOS E in the AM and PM peak hours. The PM peak hour experiences the greatest delay, which
is calculated just below the average delay threshold for LOS F.


3.4     Future Transportation Improvements in the Study Area
Per discussions with the City of Englewood and CDOT, there are no major transportation
improvement projects planned within the study area. There is a project currently in design at
CDOT that will upgrade traffic signal equipment at the Hampden Blvd. & University Ave.
intersection (replacing the span wire signal with mast arm signals with some potential minor
improvements), but this will not involve new lanes or major capacity enhancements.

3.5     Background Traffic Growth Methodology
In order to estimate background traffic growth within the study, previous traffic studies, CDOT
historic growth rates, and Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) traffic projections
were reviewed.

Historic traffic growth rates published by CDOT for US 285 and SH 177 (University south of US
285) show an annual growth rate of 1.0% and 0.9%, respectively. DRCOG traffic projections,
based on potential land use growth, represent an annual growth rate of approximately 1.5%
along Hampden Blvd. Given that the Hampden Blvd. & University Ave. intersection is currently
operating at LOS E, it is anticipated that additional traffic volume increases will result in a
lengthening of the current peak period. Thus, although the daily roadway traffic volumes may
increase at 1% to 1.5% annually over the next twenty years, the peak hour volumes may
experience less growth with most traffic growth occurring outside the current peak hour. This is
experienced along major roadway corridors throughout the Denver metro area.

Given the CDOT and DRCOG traffic growth projects and the capacity of the existing
intersection, it is estimated that the peak hour traffic growth will grow by approximately 0.2%
annually. Using this estimate, weekday AM and PM peak hour intersection volumes were
estimated for the Year 2013 and Year 2030 background scenarios. These traffic volumes are
shown on Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively.


3.6     Year 2013 Background Intersection Capacity Analysis
Intersection capacity analyses were conducted with the Year 2013 background peak hour traffic
volumes and lane geometry shown on Figure 4 and using the capacity analysis methodology
previously discussed. The intersection LOS calculation worksheets are attached in the
Appendix. The intersections LOS are summarized for each location in Table 1.

The data in the level of service summary table illustrates that, with existing peak hour volumes
and lane geometry, the Hampden Blvd. & University Ave. intersection will continue to operate at
LOS E in the AM peak hour and will operate at LOS F in the PM peak hour.

In order to help mitigate future background traffic growth in the short-term planning horizon, it is
recommended that CDOT operate a second eastbound left-turn on Hampden Blvd. at University
Ave. This lane can be implemented with minor modifications (striping, signing, and signal
heads) and may be incorporated in the signal upgrade project that CDOT is currently working
on.    This improvement would provide some additional capacity for the eastbound left-turn
movement, thus reducing the amount of green time required for the left turn. This green time
may be allocated to the heavier east-west through movements improve the overall intersection
Level of Service.


3.7     Year 2030 Background Intersection Capacity Analysis
Intersection capacity analyses were conducted with the Year 2030 background peak hour traffic
volumes and lane geometry shown on Figure 5 and using the capacity analysis methodology




Fox Higgins Transportation Group, LLC         Page 4                                February 23, 2011
previously discussed. The intersection LOS calculation worksheets are attached in the
Appendix. The intersections LOS are summarized for each location in Table 1.

The data in the level of service summary table illustrates that, with existing peak hour volumes
and lane geometry, the Hampden Blvd. & University Ave. intersection will continue to operate at
LOS E in the AM peak hour and will operate at LOS F in the PM peak hour.

As discussed above, a minor improvement that could be implemented in the short-term with
minor effort is the addition of a second eastbound left-turn lane. There are also long-term,
capital improvements that could potentially be implemented to mitigate the effects of
background traffic growth, but would require significant planning and cost. These include:

1) Adding a second southbound left-turn on University at Hampden. Due to the north-south
   offset created by the existing University Ave alignment across the intersection, adding a
   second southbound left-turn lane would require widening along the east side of University
   Ave. north of Hampden Blvd. to provide the proper alignment for northbound and
   southbound dual left-turns to operate concurrently without left-turn overlap conflicts. The
   north leg of the intersection would need to be shifted approximately 25' to the east. This
   would require acquisition of considerable ROW and significant impact to existing residences
   at the northeast corner of the intersection. Due to these significant impacts, it is not
   expected that this is a feasible option for the City/County/CDOT to increase capacity at this
   intersection within the planning horizon of this project.

2) Adding additional through lanes on Hampden Blvd. and/or University Ave. CDOT currently
   does not have any long range plans to widen Hampden Blvd. to eight lanes and this would
   require long-term planning, right-of-way acquisition, and would have significant cost
   implications. Similarly, there are no plans to widen University to six lanes and such a project
   would have major impacts to residential property.

For the reasons above, it is anticipated that the intersection of Hampden Blvd. & University Ave.
will continue to operate with the current lane geometry with only minor improvements (such as a
second eastbound left-turn lane) and those improvements that can also be incorporated as part
of the proposed Kent Place project. Calculated intersection Levels of Service at LOS E and
LOS F in the peak hours is not uncommon at major intersections throughout the Denver metro
area and does not necessitate major improvements. What can be done to improve the
intersection without impacting nearby residences should be implemented. Given the various
physical constraints at this location, major improvements are not anticipated to occur within the
timeframe of this study.

4.0       FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS WITH PROJECT

4.1       Trip Generation
The Kent Place mixed-use project is proposing to develop new commercial/retail and multi-
family residential uses. The breakdown of potential uses is as follows:

      x   30,018 SF grocery/market
      x   8,960 SF retail/commercial pad site
      x   4,800 SF retail/commercial pad site
      x   3,800 SF drive-in bank
      x   300 multi-family rental residential dwelling

Based on discussions with the development team, the two retail/commercial pads (13,760 SF
total) are currently being analyzed with a 2,400 SF restaurant and the remaining 11,360 SF as
general retail use. This breakdown was assumed for the trip generation analysis.

To determine the traffic impacts associated with the development of the site, the amount of
traffic generated by the proposed land uses were estimated. Trip generation estimates for the
site uses were obtained from rates contained in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
trip generation manual2 for the following land use categories:

              Supermarket (ITE 850)
              High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant (ITE 932)
              Specialty Retail Center (ITE 814)
              Drive-In Bank (ITE 912)
              Apartment (ITE 220)

The proposed land use square footages were applied to the ITE trip rates to estimate the new
site traffic as shown in Table 2. Based on ITE methodology and the assumptions discussed in
this section, the project is anticipated to generate 5,471 daily trips with 296 trips occurring in the
AM peak hour and 558 trips occurring during the PM peak hour.

Due to the nature of the retail land uses proposed for the project, a percentage of the
automobile traffic entering and exiting the site will be "pass-by" and "diverted" traffic from the
adjacent roadway traffic flows. This traffic currently exists on the adjacent street network and
will therefore not be considered "new" traffic to the area. The proposed project is expected to
experience the four basic commercial trip types discussed below:

      Primary Trips. These trips are made specifically to visit the site and are considered "new"
      trips. Primary trips would not have been made if the proposed project did not exist.
      Therefore, this is the only trip type that increases the total number of trips made on a
      regional basis.

          Trip Generation, Institute of Transportation Engineers, 7th Edition, 2003.




Fox Higgins Transportation Group, LLC                   Page 6                         February 23, 2011
      Diverted Trips. Diverted trips are those trips that are attracted from the adjacent roadways
      within the vicinity of the site, but require a diversion from the roadway of travel to another
      roadway in order to access the site. These roadways usually include highways or streets
      adjacent to the project, but do not provide direct access to the site. For the purposes of this
      study, diverted trips were counted as primary trips due to the close proximity of study
      intersections to the site accesses.

      Pass-By Trips. These retail related trips already exist on the roadways directly adjacent to
      the project site. Pass-by trips do not create any increase in the traffic volumes within the
      primary impact area. In fact, the only impact of the pass-by trips occurs at the site
      driveways and adjacent intersections where through movements become turning
      movements into and out of the site. Therefore, pass-by trips have no additional impact on
      the road system beyond the site's driveways or immediately adjacent intersections.

      Multi-Use Trips. These internal trips occur from one land use or building to another within
      the site boundaries. For example, a person may patronize a retail use and restaurant in one
      visit. Multi-use or multi-purpose trips do not affect the exterior site access points, nor add
      any additional traffic volumes to the adjacent street network.

Given the ITE average rates, the size of the project, and adjacent roadway traffic volumes, the
following pass-by percentages were estimated and assumed for each retail use:

      x   Supermarket: 35% pass-by
      x   Specialty Retail: 25% pass-by
      x   High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant: 40% pass-by
      x   Drive-In Bank: 45% pass-by

A 15% reduction in retail trips was also applied to account for multi-use trips (trips where a retail
patron visits more than one retail use in one trip). A 15% non-auto use was also applied for
residential trips to account for residents of the apartments on site who walk to retail uses, drive
to retail uses, and/or stop at one or more site uses on their way into or out of the site (and do
not create a unique, external vehicle trip).

Applying these assumptions, the trip type breakdown is provided on Table 3. As shown, the
new site uses are anticipated to generate the following primary and pass-by trips:

      x   Primary Trips: 4,131 daily, 234 AM peak hour, 412 PM peak hour
      x   Pass-by Trips: 1,340 daily, 63 AM peak hour, 147 PM peak hour


4.2       Trip Distribution and Assignment
The estimated primary site trips presented in Table 3 were distributed onto the adjacent street
network based on existing and future land use and traffic patterns in the area. Assumed site
distribution percentages for the primary site trips are shown on Figure 6. Pass-by traffic
distribution at the site accesses was assumed based on existing and future traffic volumes and
directional distribution along Hampden Blvd. and University Ave. adjacent to the site.




Fox Higgins Transportation Group, LLC          Page 7                                February 23, 2011
The estimated site trips were assigned to the study area roadway network and intersections
according to the distribution assumptions. The site generated traffic volumes at build out are
shown on Figure 6.


4.3     Year 2013 + Site Intersection Capacity
The Kent Place project site traffic volumes were added to the Year 2013 background traffic
volumes to determine any impacts associated with the development of the project in the short-
term scenario.

The 2013 background-plus-site peak hour volumes are illustrated on Figure 8. The study area
intersection levels of service were calculated using the LOS methodology discussed previously
with the addition of site generated peak hour traffic volumes to the existing volumes. The
results are shown in Table 1. Intersection level of service worksheets are attached in the
Appendix.

As shown in the Table 1, the University Ave & Site Access Intersection is anticipated to operate
at LOS A in the AM and PM peak hours in the 2013 short-term build out scenario. The
Hampden Blvd. & University Ave intersection is projected to operate at LOS E and LOS F in the
AM and PM peak hours, respectively, similar to the Year 2013 background condition (without
the project). Table 1b, which assumes that the 2nd eastbound left-turn lane is added with
development of the project, shows that the intersection LOS in the 2013 scenario with the
project can be improved versus the background condition with no improvements made.


4.4     Year 2030 + Site Intersection Capacity Analysis
The site traffic volumes were added to the Year 2030 background traffic volumes to determine
any impacts associated with the development of the project in the long-term. The Year 2030
background-plus-site peak hour volumes are illustrated on Figure 9. The study area
intersection levels of service were calculated using the LOS methodology discussed previously
with the addition of site generated peak hour traffic volumes to the Year 2030 background
volumes. The results are shown in Table 1. Intersection level of service worksheets are
attached in the Appendix.

As shown in Table 1, the University Ave & Site Access Intersection is anticipated to operate at
LOS A in the AM and PM peak hours in the 2030 long-term build out scenario. The Hampden
Blvd. & University Ave intersection is projected to operate at LOS E and LOS F in the AM and
PM peak hours, respectively, similar to the Year 2030 background condition (without the
project). The effects of project traffic can be mitigated to just above background (without the
project) delays with the addition of the eastbound left-turn lane on Hampden approaching
University, as shown on Table 1b. Table 1c illustrates the additional delay improvement that
could be achieved if the second southbound left-turn lane can be added on University Ave.
approaching Hampden Blvd. However, as discussed previously in this report, the provision of
this lane would require widening on the east side of University Ave. north of Hampden and is
thus not assumed to occur due to the various impacts.




Fox Higgins Transportation Group, LLC       Page 8                              February 23, 2011
4.5      Site Access and Circulation
The site plan shown on Figure 2 was reviewed for access and circulation. The proposed access
plan will provide for adequate access to the site, with a high Level of Service right-in, right-out
access from Hampden Blvd. and a signalized access along University Ave.

Projected on-site traffic queues for the eastbound approach to University Ave. will be contained
in the 125' of storage provided prior to the first intersection during the AM peak hour and the
majority of PM peak hour cycles. The projected max queues can be contained in the
intersecting approaches prior to any parking to avoid and queue storage conflicts with parking
movements. Furthermore, the site design allows vehicles to proceed westbound through the
site if need be to further avoid potential queues back towards University. It is recommended
that this on-site intersection (immediately west of the proposed University Ave. signal) function
as a two-way stop so that traffic entering off of University into the site can free flow into the site.

Continuous six-foot wide attached sidewalks are proposed along University Ave. and Hampden
Blvd. to connect to existing pedestrian facilities. Attached and detached sidewalks are
proposed throughout the site to provide pedestrian access to all retail and residential uses.

Delivery vehicle/truck access is planned to occur at the University Ave. access and during off-
peak times. Turning movements are being designed at this location to accommodate the
expected largest delivery vehicle (WB-67).


4.6      Auxiliary Lanes
Based on the preliminary site plan, the following auxiliary lanes are proposed:

Hampden Blvd. & University Ave. Intersection:
  x Southbound Left-Turn: The project proposes to extend the existing 160' lane to 275'.
  x Southbound Right-Turn: The project proposes to extend the existing 100' lane to 475'.
     This lane will function as an overlapping right-turn acceleration lane exiting the site
     access along University Ave.

University Ave. & Site Access (Signalized):
   x Southbound Right-Turn: The project proposes to construct a 205' lane plus 60' taper
       extending north to the property line.
   x Northbound Left-Turn: The project proposes to construct a 125' lane plus 110' taper.

Hampden Blvd. & Site Access (right-in, right-out):
  x Westbound Right-Turn:         The project proposes to construct a 315' overlapping
     acceleration/deceleration lane extending from University Ave. west to this access.

Per the State Highway Access Code, CDOT will require two variance requests to be submitted
with the access permit application:

      1. Variance for the overlapping acceleration/deceleration distance on Hampden Blvd.
         between University Ave. and the right-in, right-out access.

      2. Variance for the non-inclusion of an acceleration lane on Hampden Blvd. extending west
         from the right-in, right-out access. The proximity of the western site property line
         (roughly 210' west of the site access) and existing wall on the adjacent residential
         property preclude the provision of an adequate acceleration at this location. Per initial
         discussions with CDOT, it is preferred to not provide an acceleration lane rather than
         provide a substandard lane.

Per the Synchro and SimTraffic queue models, the proposed auxiliary lanes and intersection
spacing can accommodate the estimated hour traffic queues in the AM peak hour and during
most of the PM peak hour in the Year 2013 and Year 2030 scenarios. During the heaviest PM
peak hour cycles, southbound traffic queues on University Ave. from Hampden Blvd. may
extend north past the site access, as they do today. Thus, it is important that the signal timing
between the Hampden & University and University & Site Access signals be coordinated to
allow both University and site access traffic to clear through the intersection each cycle. In
similar situations, signing and/or striping has also been shown to be effective in encouraging
drivers to not block the intersection. Northbound queues on University Ave. at the proposed
signalized site access are not projected to extend south to Hampden Blvd., but similarly
coordination of these signals is necessary to ensure that traffic queues are managed given the
proximity of these signals. The project plans include a 2" conduit between these intersection to
allow for a fiber interconnect.


4.7      Additional Off-Site Traffic Impacts
Per the capacity analyses conducted for this study, traffic operations at the nearby intersections
and along adjacent roadways will remain relatively unaffected during the AM peak hour. The
proposed signal will create new gaps in traffic north of the site towards Floyd Ave during both
the AM and PM peak hours, which will provide additional opportunity for residents of the areas
to turn onto or from University Ave. During the PM peak hour, which is currently the most
congested period, traffic queues along University Ave. will extend further north than existing
conditions as a result of the new signal proposed at the University access.

5.0       CONCLUSIONS

The Kent Place project is proposing to develop a mix of residential and commercial uses on a
currently vacant 11.4-acre parcel of land located at the northwest corner of the intersection of
Hampden Blvd. (US 285) and University Ave. The project is anticipated to add roughly 4,100
new trips per day to the adjacent roadway network with an additional 1,340 daily pass-by trips
that are already on the existing roadway network and will divert to the site's retail uses. In
comparison to the previously analyzed site land use plan, the current site plan represents a
reduction of just over 20% in daily trips vs. what was previously approved for the PUD.

Access to the site is proposed along University Ave. roughly 575' north of Hampden Blvd. and at
a right-in, right-out only access along Hampden Blvd. located roughly 400' west of University
Ave. This traffic impact study reviewed short-term (Year 2013) and long-term (Year 2030) traffic
conditions in the vicinity of the site both with and without the project.

Based on the project traffic estimates, the project would add roughly 2% to the AM peak hour
and 3% to the PM peak hour entering volumes at the Hampden & University intersection. It
was determined that the existing and future roadway and intersection network can serve the site
added traffic volumes in the short and long-term scenarios with the proposed improvements in
place. The improvements include:

      x   Construction of a continuous southbound right-turn lane and westbound right-turn lane
          along the project frontage. The project proposes to extend the existing southbound right-
          turn lane at the Hampden & University intersection from 100' (existing) to 450' and will
          extend the existing southbound left-turn lane from 160' to 275'. This will add capacity to
          the Hampden & University intersection and help to mitigate the effect of site-added traffic
          in the peak hours. Due to the proximity of the intersections, the project plans for a 2"
          fiber interconnect between the proposed new signal and the existing signal at Hampden
          & University. This will allow for the intersections to be coordinated and will help manage
          queues between the intersections.

      x   Add a second eastbound-to-northbound left-turn lane at the Hampden & University
          intersection to add additional capacity. This improvement can be implemented with
          restriping and minor signal modifications. Implementation of these improvements would
          result in post-project Levels of Service similar to those projected without the project.

                                      LEVEL OF SERVICE DEFINITIONS


In rating roadway and intersection operating conditions with existing or future traffic volumes, "Levels
of Service" (LOS) A through F are used, with LOS A indicating very good operation and LOS F
indicating poor operation. Levels of service at signalized and unsignalized intersections are closely
associated with vehicle delays experienced in seconds per vehicle. More complete level of service
definitions and delay data for signal and stop sign controlled intersections are contained in the
following table for reference.



     Level      Delay in seconds per vehicle (a)
   of Service
     Rating     Signalized      Unsignalized                                         Definition

                                                   Low vehicular traffic volumes; primarily free flow operations. Density is low
      A         0.0 to 10.0       0.0 to 10.0      and vehicles can freely maneuver within the traffic stream. Drivers are able
                                                   to maintain their desired speeds with little or no delay.

                                                   Stable vehicular traffic volume flow with potential for some restriction of
                                                   operating speeds due to traffic conditions. Vehicle maneuvering is only
      B         10.1 to 20.0     10.1 to 15.0
                                                   slightly restricted. The stopped delays are not bothersome and drivers are
                                                   not subject to appreciable tension.

                                                   Stable traffic operations, however the ability for vehicles to maneuver is more
                                                   restricted by the increase in traffic volumes. Relatively satisfactory operating
      C         20.1 to 35.0     15.1 to 25.0
                                                   speeds prevail, but adverse signal coordination or longer vehicle queues
                                                   cause delays along the corridor.

                                                   Approaching unstable vehicular traffic flow where small increases in volume
                                                   could cause substantial delays. Most drivers are restricted in ability to
      D         35.1 to 55.0     25.1 to 35.0
                                                   maneuver and selection of travel speeds due to congestion. Driver comfort
                                                   and convenience are low, but tolerable.

                                                   Traffic operations characterized by significant approach delays and average
                                                   travel speeds of one-half to one-third the free flow speed. Vehicular flow is
      E         55.1 to 80.0     35.1 to 50.0      unstable and there is potential for stoppages of brief duration. High signal
                                                   density, extensive vehicle queuing, or corridor signal progression/timing are
                                                   the typical causes of vehicle delays at signalized corridors.

                                                   Forced vehicular traffic flow and operations with high approach delays at
                                                   critical intersections. Vehicle speeds are reduced substantially and
       F          > 80.0            > 50.0
                                                   stoppages may occur for short or long periods of time because of
                                                   downstream congestion.

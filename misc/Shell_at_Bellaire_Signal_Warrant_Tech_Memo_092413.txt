A site visit was conducted to determine existing traffic controls, posted speed limits, lane widths, lane
assignments, approach grades, sight distances, pedestrian facilities, major trip generators, and nearby
railroad crossings. The TMUTCD states that:

         ...engineering judgment and rationale should be applied to a street approach with one
         through/left-turn lane plus a right-turn lane. In this case, the degree of conflict of minor-street
         right-turn traffic with traffic on the major street should be considered. Thus, right-turn traffic should
         not be included in the minor-street volume if the movement enters the major street with minimal
         conflict. The approach should be evaluated as a one-lane approach with only the traffic volume in
         the through/left-turn lane considered.

Study Procedure

The Texas Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (Texas MUTCD, 2011 Edition) defines nine (9)
warrants, or justifying set of conditions, at least one of which should be fully satisfied before signalization
is considered as an option for traffic control. Factors included in the evaluation of these warrants include
vehicle and pedestrian traffic volumes, the number of traffic lanes, the prevailing traffic speeds, traffic
crash history, and measured delay for minor street traffic. The individual warrants are listed below,
followed by a short description of each.

Warrant 1, Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume
Warrant 2, Four-Hour Vehicular Volume

Warrant 3, Peak Hour Vehicular Volume
Warrant 4, Pedestrian Volume
Warrant 5, School Crossing
Warrant 6, Coordinated Signal System
Warrant 7, Crash Experience
Warrant 8, Roadway Network
Warrant 9, Intersection Near a Grade Crossing

Warrant 1, Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume ­ as the title implies, this criteria is applied to the eight highest
demand hours of the day for the major and minor street. Two criteria are checked. Condition A is based
on minimum vehicular volumes. Condition B is based on interruption of continuous traffic. For both
conditions, there are a number of reduction factors that may be taken. If the 85th percentile speed on the
major street is greater than 40 mph, or if the intersection lies within the built-up area of an isolated
community having a population less than 10,000, the criteria can be reduced by 70%. If traffic counts are
high enough, an 80% reduction factor is applied. Finally, if both conditions are met, both are applied,
resulting in a 56% reduction.

Warrant 2, Four-Hour Vehicular Volume ­ This warrant is similar to the eight hour warrant and is based
on traffic volumes during the highest four hours of the day. Traffic volumes are plotted on a graph to
determine if they fall above the warrant curves. The reduction criteria are similar. If one of the two
conditions applies, then a second graph with lower curves is used.

Warrant 3, Peak Hour Volume ­ This warrant is intended for use at a location where traffic conditions
create undue delay to the side street for one or more hours during the day. Total stopped time delay for
the side street must be documented in order to use this warrant. Reduction criteria and graphs similar to
those in Warrant 2 are applied. If this is the only warrant that is met, it is generally recommended that it
operate in flashing mode during other times of the day and be vehicle actuated when in operation.

Warrant 4, Pedestrian Volume ­ This warrant is intended when traffic on the major street is so heavy,
pedestrians experience excessive delay in crossing the street. This warrant is not intended to be used
whenever the intersection less than 300 feet from another signal or 100 feet from a Stop controlled
intersection. Pedestrian detection is required.

Warrant 5, School Crossing ­ This warrant is used where the fact that school children cross the major
street is the principal reason to consider installing a signal. A minimum of 20 school children (elementary
through high school) must cross during the highest hour and a study must show that the number of
adequate gaps in the vehicle stream does not exist. Before installing a signal under this warrant, other
remedial measures must be considered (i.e. warning signs and flashers, school speed zones, crossing
guards, grade separation, etc.).

Warrant 6, Coordinated Signal System ­ If vehicle platoons in a coordinated system tend to "spread out"
and need to be regrouped, this warrant can be used. Adjacent signals should be at least 1,000 feet apart.

Warrant 7, Crash Experience ­ Requires that five or more reported crashes, correctible by a traffic signal,
to have occurred in the last 12 months. It is important to note that certain types of accidents, such as rear

ends, are not reduced when a signal is installed. There are minimum volume requirements for vehicles or
pedestrians as well.

Warrant 8, Roadway Network ­ This warrant is used to encourage concentration and organization of
traffic flow on a roadway network. It must be used on a principal through street and meet minimum
volume requirements. Certain criteria must also be met for a roadway to be considered a major route.

Warrant 9, Intersection Near A Grade Crossing ­ If an intersection is less than 140 feet from an at grade
railroad crossing, and certain minimum traffic volumes are present, a signal with track preemption is
required, only after other alternatives have been considered.

Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis

An existing conditions analysis was completed to determine whether or not the current conditions warrant
a traffic signal. The results are listed below:

Warrant 1, Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume ­Warrant Met
Warrant 2, Four-Hour Vehicular Volume ­Warrant Met
Warrant 3, Peak Hour ­ Met for 1 hour ­ Warrant Met
Warrant 4, Pedestrian Volume ­ Only 1 pedestrian during peak 4 hours ­ Warrant Not Met
Warrant 5, School Crossing ­ Not Applicable
Warrant 6, Coordinated Signal System ­ Not Applicable
Warrant 7, Crash Experience ­ 0 accidents from 2009 to 2012 ­ Warrant Not Met
Warrant 8, Roadway Network ­ Not Applicable
Warrant 9, Intersection Near a Grade Crossing ­ Not Applicable

The warrant analysis worksheet for Warrants 1, 2, and 3 is included in the Appendix.

Conclusion and Recommendations

The 2011 Edition of the TMUTCD contains nine warrants for traffic signals. This intersection currently
meets three of the five applicable warrants (Eight Hour, Four Hour, and Peak Hour). Based on the criteria,
a traffic signal is warranted at this time for the intersection of Shell Road and Westbury Lane/Bellaire
Drive.

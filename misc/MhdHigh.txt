                                    1.0. INTRODUCTION

Traffic circulation and pedestrian safety issues near Moorhead Senior High School have been
evident for several years. The safety of Moorhead Senior High School students and Moorhead
Sports Center attendees has been the main concern of high school and City of Moorhead
administrators and staff. To deal with these issues, several studies have been performed to
evaluate traffic operations and safety and provided recommendations for improvement.

In the fall of 1989, the 21st St. underpass on the south side of US Highway 10 was completed. The
completion of the underpass posed some potential safety issues for traffic entering the High
School. Therefore, the Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Council of Governments (Metro COG)
completed a report in 1991 entitled Moorhead 21st Street Corridor Report that evaluated the
traffic circulation entering the high school from 21st St.

In 1995, the Metro COG completed the Moorhead Senior High School Parking/Traffic Study. At
that time, the Moorhead Sports Center had been completed, adding to the vehicular and pedestrian
traffic on 24th St. The primary issues reviewed by the study were parking, traffic circulation,
pedestrian safety, and safety of southbound left-turn movements from 21st St. onto 2nd Ave. S.
Since the completion of 1995 study, increased traffic congestion has once again caused concern for
pedestrian safety in the area surrounding the Moorhead Senior High School and the Moorhead
Sports Center.

In 2000, Moorhead Senior High School staff contacted the City of Moorhead Public Works
Department because of pedestrian safety concerns and traffic flow around the high school and the
sports center. The Public Works Department requested the Metro COG to complete an analysis of
the pedestrian mid-block crossing on 24th St. before school started in the fall. The analysis
resulted in a technical memorandum recommending short- and long-term improvements at that
location.

The study outlined in this report is the latest to address additional traffic circulation and pedestrian
safety issues. A formal request was made to the Moorhead City Council by the City of Moorhead
Public Works Department for Metro COG to complete an analysis in the year 2001. The
Moorhead City Council passed a resolution on December 11, 2000 requesting technical assistance
from Metro COG to conduct a study on traffic and pedestrian flow and safety in the area delineated
by 21st St., 24th St., 2nd Ave. S., and 4th Ave. S. Since Metro COG staff time had already been
allocated for 2001, Metro COG suggested completing the study with 2001 funding apportionment
set aside for technical assistance from the Advanced Traffic Analysis Center (ATAC).


                                       2.0. OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of this study are to assess traffic circulation and safety in the Moorhead
Senior High School and Moorhead Sports Center vicinity and to develop and evaluate effective
alternatives addressing any deficiencies (note Figure 1). The ATAC worked closely with
Metro COG, Moorhead Senior High School, City of Moorhead Public Works Department,

Moorhead Parks and Recreations, Moorhead Police, and other relevant entities to identify all
issues and develop a comprehensive set of alternative solutions. The recommendations from this
study generally fall into one of the following two categories:

Short-Term:    High impact, low-cost measures that can be implemented before the beginning of
               the fall 2001-2002 school year to improve traffic circulation and pedestrian safety
               (such as traffic control devices, traffic circulation plans, etc.)

Long-Term:     More significant transportation improvements (high-costs) that would be planned
               for future implementation and would require incorporation into future planned
               roadway improvements and other relevant developments (such as the 4th Ave. S.,
               21st St. grade separation and road re-alignment efforts)


                                    3.0. INPUT PROCESS
Input from all related and interested parties is important for a concise and thorough evaluation.
The needs and concerns were expressed from public officials, high school students, and the
general public. Preliminary meetings were held with staff from the Moorhead Independent School
District, Moorhead Senior High School, and Metro COG. These meetings discussed the concerns
of the pedestrian safety and traffic circulation around the high school area and ATAC staff
developed a scope of work to perform the study.

A committee was established to identify the critical issues surrounding the study area, including
representatives from a variety of agencies, including Moorhead Independent School District,
Moorhead Senior High School, Moorhead Public Works Department, Moorhead Parks
Department, Moorhead Police, and Moorhead Fire Department (Appendix A). The first committee
meeting was held on March 7, 2001 and the committee members identified several concerns and
issues, as well as proposed solutions for the study.

Solicitation for comments was also needed from students, parents, high school staff, and the
general public. ATAC staff met with the Parent/Teacher Advisory Council (PTAC), surveyed high
school students and staff, and held a public input meeting on April 19, 2001. The meetings and
surveys were intended to obtain information about safety concerns and suggestions for
improvement within the study area. A preliminary report was presented to the committee and
general public to discuss the alternatives for the short-term and long-term improvements to the
study area.

                                         3.1. Input Surveys

Two questionnaires were developed to capture the feelings and attitudes towards pedestrian safety
and traffic circulation around the high school area. One survey was developed for high school
students while the other targeted high school staff, parents, and the general public. The next
sections will discuss the results obtained from the surveys.

3.1.1 Moorhead Senior High Student Survey
The student surveys were given to two English classes per grade level; therefore, the results will
not be slanted to one grade level or age group. Survey responses were obtained by 203 students
and accounted for approximately 12 percent of the total student body. A copy of the survey is
shown in Appendix B and the results of the survey are shown in Appendix C. The following few
paragraphs describe some key results of the survey.

According to the survey results, 46 percent of the students drive to school, 28 percent receive a
ride from a sibling or friend, and 21 percent ride the bus. Based on the student responses, 68
percent of them drive or ride along 24th St. The results showed that 85 percent of the students
stated that they walk across 24th St., having 62 percent cross for physical education classes and 53
percent cross for sporting activities (note: students could select multiple options). Of the 173
students that responded that they walk across 24th St., 35 percent of them do not feel safe while
crossing. The two main reasons for not feeling safe were related to speeding vehicles and student
drivers that were not paying attention or were performing exhibition driving. The times of day that
created the most safety concerns were the lunch periods and the afternoon period during school
dismissal.

The survey also asked a few questions related to accidents and near misses. These questions
provide additional insight since not all accidents are reportable and near misses are very difficult
to document. An accident can be defined as an incident that involves contact with one or more
vehicles resulting in property damage and/or personal injury. According to the survey results, 13
percent or 27 of the students stated that they have been involved in or witnessed an accident on
24th St. Six of the students stated that they were involved in vehicle/vehicle accidents along 24th
St. and one student stated he/she was in an accident involving a vehicle striking a pedestrian.
Several students were also involved in or witnessed near misses, including four near misses
involving vehicle/pedestrian collisions.

A few questions on the survey were related to speeding. When asked about speeding along 24th
St., 43 percent of the students responded that speeding was an issue and 44 percent stated that
speeding is an issue elsewhere on campus. Of the 90 students that stated speeding was an issue at
other locations, 67 percent stated 2nd Ave. S. was one of the locations. In addition, of the 27
respondents who stated other pedestrian or traffic safety issues were evident on campus, 59
percent specified 2nd Ave. S.

When asked about potential solutions to the safety problems along 24th St., 56 percent of the
students stated that a pedestrian skywalk/tunnel would be the best option, followed by reducing
speed (10 percent), and stopping vehicle traffic (7 percent). It should be noted that 31 percent of
the surveyed students felt that safety was not a problem.

3.1.2 Public Input Meeting Survey
A survey was also developed for parents, high school and sports center staff, and the general
public and was very similar to the one given to the students. The survey was given to attendees of
the April PTAC meeting, the first public input meeting, and Moorhead Senior High School staff for
a total of 135 responses (125 from staff, 8 from PTAC, and 2 from the input meeting). Appendices
D and E show the survey and results of the survey. Similar to the high school survey, this section
will focus on some of the critical questions.

The respondents of this survey were primarily high school staff and 25 percent were parents of
students attending the high school. In terms of pedestrian safety along 24th St., 48 percent of the
respondents stated the issue was extremely important and 38 percent stated it was somewhat
important.

Thirty percent of the respondents stated they or their child have been involved in or witnessed an
accident or near miss. Eleven respondents were involved in near misses: seven consisted of
vehicle/pedestrian conflicts and four consisted of vehicle/vehicle conflicts. Seven respondents
have witnessed vehicle/vehicle accidents along 24th St. and eleven have witnessed
vehicle/pedestrian near misses.

Many of the respondents stated that speeding was an issue along 24th St. (80 percent) and along
other streets within the area (87 percent). Of the 118 people who stated speeding occurred
elsewhere around campus, 78 percent stated that it occurred along 2nd Ave. S.

The survey also asked about other pedestrian safety issues besides 24th St. The two highest ranked
locations were 2nd Ave. S. and 21st St. with 80 percent and 41 percent of the responses,
respectively. The respondents had many comments related to safety issues and most were related
to irresponsible driving and speeding in the parking lot.

Similar to the student responses, a pedestrian tunnel/skywalk was selected to be the best option to
solve the pedestrian issue along 24th St. with 32 percent of the respondents. Reduce speed and
stop vehicle traffic were 28 percent and 21 percent, respectively.


                        4.0. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY AREA
The study area primarily consists of the Moorhead Senior High School and the Moorhead Sports
Center vicinity. Moorhead Senior High School is the only high school in the City of Moorhead for
students in the grade levels of 9-12. As of February 2001, 1,813 students were enrolled at the
high school. Similar to other school districts around the Fargo-Moorhead area, the high school is
projecting future enrollments to decrease. Based on projections for 2006, enrollment will
decrease to 1,650 students and stabilize for the following 10 years. Typical hours of operation for
the high school are 8:30 AM - 2:55 PM. The high school incorporates two lunch periods for the
students: 11:30 - 12:00 PM and 12:30 - 1:00 PM.

The Moorhead Sport Center was constructed in 1974 and was expanded in 1991. The facility was
primarily built to serve the activities of the Moorhead Parks and Recreation Department. The
building's ground level contains two sheets of ice, as well as offices for the Moorhead Parks and
Recreation Department staff and the Clay County Outreach Program. The Clay County Outreach
Program provides day treatment to mentally and emotionally ill children in grade 7 to 12. The
program can accommodate 16 children. The second floor primarily consists of a weight/exercise
room and art room which is used by high school students and the general public.

Several school activities and sporting events are held at the sports center. Throughout the day
physical education and art classes are held at the sports center. Also, during the high school's two
lunch periods, many students eat lunch at the sports center's concession stand.

                                   4.1. Roadway Characteristics

The study area, as shown on the Figure 1, includes the area surrounding the Moorhead Senior High
School and Moorhead Sports Center, as delineated by 21st St., Euclid St., 24th St., 2nd Ave. S., and
4th Ave. S. Twenty-first Street is a four-lane minor arterial with a shared left-turn lane (2nd Ave.
S. - 4th Ave. S.) which borders the west side of the school property. Running along the south side
of the school property, 4th Ave. S. is a two-lane collector road. In addition, a loading zone is
located in front of the school on 4th Ave. S. Second Avenue South provides direct access to the
school parking lot from 21st St. Euclid St. also provides west side access to the parking lot.
Running between the high school and sports center, 24th St. serves as a local road, providing
access to the north school parking lot. The streets within the study area are owned and maintained
by the City of Moorhead. Therefore, maintenance activities, such as road repairs, pavement
markings, and road signs are performed by the city on a periodic basis.

A raised crosswalk was constructed in 1995 at the mid-block crossing of 24th St. The raised
crosswalk was intended to provide a safe location for pedestrians to cross, as well as deter
motorists from speeding through the crossing area. However, the crosswalk has sunk over the
years and may not be as effective in reducing speeds as was intended.

                          4.2. Traffic Control and Pavement Markings

Stop signs are the primary form of traffic control in and around the high school area, as shown is
Figure 2. The intersection of 4th Ave. S. and 21st St. is the only signalized intersection within the
study area and operates as an actuated-uncoordinated signal.

Pavement markings for roadway lanes and pedestrian crossings are maintained by the City of
Moorhead and are performed annually. During the ATAC's field observations, the pavement
markings within the study area were faded and sometimes nonexistent.

                                   4.3. Parking Characteristics

Parking for the Moorhead Senior High School and Moorhead Sports Center is primarily located to
the north of the high school, as illustrated in Figure 3. The parking lot has a capacity of 705
vehicles and is owned and maintained by the Moorhead Independent School District. During a
typical school day, the parking lot is near capacity. Since the capacity of the parking is limited,
problems with parking arise when sports center events occur during school hours. Approximately
six sports center special events overlap with school hours. Thirty-five parking spaces are also
available for staff and students on the west side of the building along Euclid St. Moorhead Parks
and Recreation staff parking is located along the north and east sides of the sports center. Short-
term parking is available north of the high school and sports center. Some on-street parking is also
available along 4th Ave. S. east of 24th St.

Handicapped parking is available along 24th St. between the high school and sports center in two
locations: 1) along the west side of 24th St. north of the mid-block crosswalk and 2) along the east
side of 24th St. south of the sports center. The main parking lot also provides 10 parking spaces
for the physically disabled.

A fire lane runs along the east side of 24th St. in front of the sports center and is identified by
NO PARKING FIRE LANE signs along that side. The area south of the crosswalk is used for bus
loading. This area is marked with NO PARKING BUS LOADING AND UNLOADING and
TOW-AWAY ZONE signs.


                                      4.4. Current Land Use

The high school and the sports center are the primary areas of interest, however, several other
activity areas are located adjacent to these facilities. An outdoor sports complex is located east of
the high school consisting of football fields (one for games and three for practice), a soccer field,
and three baseball/softball fields.

Several railroad tracks act as the northern boundary of the high school area and limit access to
both the Moorhead Senior High School and the Moorhead Sports Center. The property line of the
high school is located just north of main parking lot and a private business is located to the west of
the main parking lot. Therefore, access for motorists along the north and west sides of the high
school is limited.

Advanced Traffic Analysis Center
                                      4.5. Pedestrian Activity

Depending on the time of day, several locations experience heavy pedestrian movements by high
school students. Figure 4 illustrates the five marked crosswalks within the study area. The
crosswalk on 4th Ave. S. at Euclid St. has high volumes of students crossing during the lunch hours.
Second Avenue South between the parking lot and the high school experiences high volumes of
students and high school staff during the morning and afternoon periods. Most of the pedestrians
crossing 2nd Ave. S. are evenly distributed along the street.

Twenty-fourth Street between Moorhead Senior High School and the Sports Center has been
identified as the study's critical area for pedestrian and vehicle traffic. High volumes of vehicle
and pedestrian traffic along 24th St. primarily occur during lunch hour and afternoon periods. A
mid-block pedestrian crossing is located on 24th St. to serve as the main pedestrian crossing point.

High school students use the mid-block crossing on 24th St. for several reasons. There are 14
crossing periods between the two buildings during a typical school day: 6 for class periods, 4 for
lunch hour, and 4 for adaptive physical education. Students participate in several activities at the
sports center during school hours, such as physical education class, ice skating, hockey, and
archery. It is estimated that approximately 200 students leave campus for lunch. Therefore, safety
concerns are evident during the lunch periods due to the high vehicle and pedestrian conflicts at the
mid-block crosswalk of 24th St.


                          5.0. TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS
Several types of information on traffic characteristics and other data are needed for the study. The
data will be used to evaluate the current conditions of the study area, as well as guide the
proposed solutions. This section discusses the traffic data and how it relates to safety for the high
school area.

                                      5.1. Traffic Circulation

Most of the roadways within the study area are two-way streets. However, Euclid St. consists of
two one-ways that are separated by a boulevard with a small parking area along the southbound
one-way. The access road along the north and east side of the sports center operates as a one-way
traveling east and south to 4th Ave. S. The access road also consists of three speed bumps for
traffic calming.

Traffic circulation for the high school and sports center during the morning, midday, and afternoon
peak periods is not ideal for several reasons. First of all, most of the drivers are young and
inexperienced. Second, the geometric layout of the 2nd Ave. S. and Euclid St. intersection creates
a confusing situation for some motorists. Third, inadequate pavement markings within the study
area do not show pedestrian crosswalks and lane delineation.




Moorhead Senior High School and Sports Center Traffic Circulation and Pedestrian Safety Study      10
Advanced Traffic Analysis Center
Up to 25 buses can be at the high school at one time. Buses load students along the north, west,
and east sides of the high school. Buses park in such a manner that students do not have to cross
the street to load the bus, thus limiting vehicle/pedestrian conflicts.

Motorists may enter the parking lot for the high school and sports center by using three access
points: 2nd Ave. S. and 21st St., 4th Ave. S. and Euclid St., and 4th Ave. S. and 24th St. The access
road around the north and east side of the sports center is a one-way street towards 4th Ave. S.;
therefore, motorists have another option to depart from the parking lot.

During the morning periods while school is in session, more vehicles enter the parking lot using
2nd Ave. S. and 21st St. than the other intersections. In fact, the southbound left-turn movement at
2nd Ave. S. and 21st St. provides the most vehicles traveling to the high school than any other
movement. This fact is interesting because the southbound left-turn movement is not a legal
movement at the intersection.

During the two lunch periods, traffic patterns are not very well defined. Although vehicle volumes
during the midday are not significant, the large pedestrian volumes crossing the mid-block
crosswalk on 24th St. create significant vehicle/pedestrian conflicts.

Traffic primarily departs the high school in the afternoon peak using 24th St. and 2nd Ave. S. Three
intersections are congested during this peak period: 2nd Ave. S. and Euclid St., 2nd Ave. S. and
access road, and 4th Ave. S. and 24th St. The intersection of 2nd Ave. S. and Euclid St. has some
alignment issues that possibly create driver confusion related to the proper stop location. The
safety issue at the intersection of 2nd Ave. S. and access road is a result of traffic congestion at 4th
Ave. S. and 24th St. Southbound traffic leaving the parking lot queues near the access road. When
this congestion occurs, some motorists make hasty decisions of whether to remain on 24th St. or
turn off and use the access road. These motorists may not notice the pedestrian traffic crossing the
access road along the east side of 24th St.

                                     5.2. Accident Information

Accident or crash data are useful to determine whether a safety issue is evident in a certain
location. A high number of accidents may be a result of several factors, including inadequate
roadway geometry, street lighting, pavement markings, etc. Intersections with high volumes of
vehicle and pedestrian traffic typically have higher accident rates since they are exposed to more
vehicle/pedestrian interactions. Accident data for the past 10 years were obtained from the
Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT). Over the past 10 years, a total of 85
accidents were reported within the study area (Table 1). Appendix F contains tables that
illustrates several crash attributes, such as the number and type of crash, for the intersections
within the study area, while Appendix G graphically illustrates the crashes over the last five years
1996-2000). Of the 85 accidents, 69 consisted of property damage, 16 consisted of personal
injury, and 3 included vehicle/pedestrian collisions. The intersections of 2nd Ave. S. and 21st St.
and 4th Ave. S. and 21st St. had the highest number of accidents reporting 19 and 48 accidents,
respectively, representing 79 percent of the total number of accidents.

                                          5.3. Traffic Volumes

Average annual daily traffic (AADT) and turning- movement counts were collected for the study
area. The 2000 AADT along 4th Ave. S. ranged from 2,700 to as high as 4,800 in front of the high
school. The AADT along 21st St. near the High School was approximately 14,500. Based on the
2020 projections, the 21st St. could experience daily volumes of 19,000. This increase in traffic
poses an increased concern for this area.

Turning-movement counts were performed in April 2001 at the intersections within the study area
(Appendix H). The counts were conducted during the morning, midday, and afternoon peak
periods. It should be noted that the peak periods were very short in duration, typically less than 15
minutes. The counts were performed to determine the traffic circulation patterns during the various
peak periods and support the traffic analysis.

Based on the counts, it was determined that more vehicles arrive at the high school using 2nd Ave.
S. and 21st St. than any other intersection. In fact, the southbound left-turn movement at this
intersection supplied more vehicles than any other movement in the morning (142 vehicles during
the peak hour). The movement has been illegal since 1991 due to concerns that traffic may spill
back to 1st Ave. S. resulting in additional traffic congestion at that intersection as well. The next
highest movements of traffic to the high school were the northbound right-turn movement at 2nd
Ave. S. and 21st St. and the northbound through movement at 4th Ave. S. and 24th St., which
supplied 135 and 111 vehicles, respectively.

Traffic volumes during the lunch periods were significantly less than the morning or afternoon
peak periods. This is mainly attributed to students walking to the sports center or adjacent stores
for lunch. During the lunch periods, the intersection of 2nd Ave. S. and 21st St. provided the most
traffic entering and exiting the high school area.

The afternoon dismissal of school creates an extremely large surge of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic in a very short period of time. Most of the afternoon traffic exits the north parking lot using
two intersections: 2nd Ave. S. and 21st St. and 4th Ave. S. and 24th St. Based on field
observations, traffic queues north of the mid-block crosswalk of 24th St. for approximately a 10-

Moorhead Senior High School and Sports Center Traffic Circulation and Pedestrian Safety Study           13

minute period. As traffic queues at this location, motorists leaving the parking lot in the
southbound direction from the east side will use the access road around the sports center. This
maneuver can create safety issues if the motorists are not watching for pedestrians that are crossing
the access road on the east side of 24th St.

                                      5.4. Vehicle Speed Data

Spot speed studies were performed at the mid-block crosswalk on 24th St. during the morning and
afternoon periods using JAMAR TDC-8 devices. Sample speeds were recorded for every third
vehicle traveling northbound and southbound and the speeds were taken over the crosswalk
location.

Table 2. Speed Data for 24th St. at the Mid-block Crosswalk.

   Southbound/AM                 46                 18                  18                 39
   Northbound/PM                 29                 17                  7                  24
   Southbound/PM                 68                 15                  11                 16

Although a raised crosswalk was constructed in 1995 to slow down vehicles along 24th St.,
speeding is still prevalent. The percentage of speeding vehicles ranged from 16 to 42 percent. It
should be noted that the "Southbound/PM" could have been higher, however, congestion from the
intersection of 4th Ave. S. and 24th St. caused vehicles to slow down through the crosswalk area.

                                      5.5. Pedestrian Volumes

Pedestrian data were obtained in conjunction with the vehicle counts at all of the intersections
within the study area during the peak periods. However, additional pedestrian data were gathered
throughout the day at two critical locations: the mid-block crosswalk on 24th St. and 2nd Ave. S.
crosswalk. The mid-block crosswalk is the most heavily used crossing within the study area.
Students use the crossing for classes, sporting activities, as well as for lunch-hour concessions.
Appendix I provides detailed information related to the mid-block crosswalk while Table 3
provides a summary of the pedestrian counts. According to the pedestrian counts, 1,770 crossings
were observed during the hours of 7:45 AM - 4:45 PM. A crossing consists of a one-way
movement and they were annotated as proper or improper crossings. A proper crossing consisted
of pedestrians using the crosswalk whereas improper crossings were those made without using the
crosswalk or only using a portion of the crosswalk. Improper crossings primarily consisted of
pedestrians that crossed near the crosswalk or those who made diagonal movements to and from
the sports center. The lunch periods and the dismissal of school provided the highest pedestrian
volumes. It also should be noted that over 27 percent of the total crossings were classified as
improper.

During the lunch-hour periods a number of students use the crosswalk on 4th Ave. S. at Euclid St.
to travel to the Holiday Gas Station for lunch while others congregated at an empty lot to socialize.
Pedestrian crossings for this crosswalk totaled 96 during the two lunch periods.

                                       5.6. Vehicle Gap Data

Vehicle gaps were also recorded at the mid-block crosswalk of 24th St. for the morning, midday
and afternoon peak periods to determine if the crossing warranted a pedestrian traffic signal.
These data were needed to determine whether the pedestrians had adequate gaps between traffic to
cross 24th St. Warrant 4 of the 2000 Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) states
that the number of adequate gaps must be greater than the number of minutes being evaluated1. The
length of the study is based on when the crossing is being used. The required gap time was
calculated and includes the following:

      Equation 1. Adequate Gap Time for School Crossings
            G = 1 + W / 35
                         . + 2N
        Where: G = adequate gap time, seconds
              W = width of the street, feet
              N = the number of rows of pedestrians crossing in the 85th percentile group

The values for the variables N and W were determined to be 1 and 46, respectively. Therefore,
16.2 seconds was required for a vehicle gap. The gap analysis was performed during the peak 30
minutes of the morning and afternoon periods. Table 4 shows the number of gaps and duration of
the study. Since the number of gaps is greater than the number of minutes for two peak periods, a
pedestrian traffic signal is not warranted according to the MUTCD.

                                  5.7. Vehicle/Pedestrian Conflicts

Vehicle/pedestrian interactions were observed from 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM along 24th St. and 2nd
Ave. S. The crossing locations along the two streets were video taped and analyzed afterwards.
A vehicle/pedestrian conflict was annotated when vehicles stopped or swerved to avoid
pedestrians or when pedestrians yield to vehicular traffic (Table 5). Most of the conflicts
consisted of vehicles yielding to pedestrians that were crossing the street. Based on the analysis,
24th St. and 2nd Ave. S. recorded vehicle/pedestrian conflicts of 37 and 23, respectively. The
analysis also showed that most of the conflicts occurred during the lunch hours.

                            6.0. ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS

To effectively develop alternative solutions for the study, several types of information were
gathered, including meetings with the committee members, PTAC members, and the initial public
input meeting; surveying the high school students and staff, as well as the general public; and
collecting data related to the current land use and traffic conditions of the area. Based on the
various forms of input and data collection, several short-term and long-term solutions were

Moorhead Senior High School and Sports Center Traffic Circulation and Pedestrian Safety Study       16
Advanced Traffic Analysis Center
developed for improving pedestrian safety and traffic circulation and are discussed in the
following sections. Since the proposed solutions are related to engineering improvements, another
section will discuss additional improvements that will assist in safety and traffic circulation.

                                    6.1. Short-Term Solutions

Short-term solutions consist of low-cost measures that can be implemented in the fall of 2001.
Several potential solutions were analyzed and presented at the June 14, 2001 committee meeting.
After the presentation, several committee members provided comments and feedback on the
proposed solutions. The committee expressed interest in several of the proposed short-term
improvements, which were documented in a July 6, 2001 memorandum and include the following:

·      Establish school speed zones - lower the existing 30 mph speed limit to 20 mph
·      Construct a mid-block crosswalk at 2nd Ave. S.
·      Construct pedestrian refuges at the mid-block crosswalks of 2nd Ave. S. and 24th St.
·      Construct speed bumps/humps near the mid-block crosswalks of 2nd Ave. S. and 24th St.
·      Implement one-way circulation of the main parking lot

The committee meeting also brought up other relevant concerns/suggestions for the project. The
discussion items included the following:

·      Implement a two-way left turn lane along 21st St. between 1st Ave. S. and 4th Ave. S.
·      Construct an additional parking lot northeast of the sports center
·      Construct a bus shelter near the intersection of 4th Ave. S. and 24th St.

On July, 19, 2001, the committee reconvened to reach a consensus on the short-term items outlined
in the July 6, 2001 memorandum. The committee finalized a plan of action for the short-term
solutions, which was documented in the July 26, 2001 memorandum. The items of discussion
included the following:

1.     Establish school speed zones of 20 mph on 24th St., Euclid St., 2nd Ave. S., and the
       access road
2.     Construct a mid-block crosswalk at 2nd Ave. S. with speed humps
3.     Construct speed bumps near the mid-block crosswalk at 24th St.
4.     Implement a two-way left turn lane along 21st St. between 1st Ave. S. and 4th Ave. S.
5.     Modify the north parking lot to one-way traffic circulation
6.     Construct an additional parking lot northeast of the sports center

Each of the proposed short-term improvements will be discussed in detail and are extracted from
the July 26, 2001 memorandum. Items 1-4 can be implemented with relatively low funds and in a
short time frame. Items 5 and 6 can be implemented in late 2001 or summer of 2002.

6.1.1. Establish School Speed Zones Along 24th St., Euclid St., 2nd Ave. S., and Access
Road
Reducing speed limits along roadways adjacent to schools can be an effective method of
improving pedestrian safety since vehicles would have more time to react to pedestrians.

Moorhead Senior High School and Sports Center Traffic Circulation and Pedestrian Safety Study    17
Advanced Traffic Analysis Center
However, reduced speed limits only work if they are properly enforced. To establish a speed zone
in a school zone, the Minnesota Statues 2000, 169.14 must be followed.
Minnesota Statues 2000, 169.14, reads in part:
        Subdivision 5a. Speed zoning in School Zone; surcharge.
              (a) Local authorities may establish a school speed limit within a school
              zone of a public or nonpublic school upon the basis of an engineering
              and traffic investigation as prescribed by the commissioner of
              transportation. The establishment of a school speed limit on any trunk
              highwayshall be with the consent of the commissioner of transportation.
              Such school speed limits shall be in effect when children are present,
              going to or leaving school during opening or closing hours or during
              school recess periods. The school speed limit shall notbe lower than 15
              miles per hour and shall not be more than 20 miles per hour below the
              established speed limit on an affected street or highway if the
              established speed limit is 40 miles per hour or greater.
              (c) For the purpose of this subdivision, "school zone" means that section
              of a street or highway which abuts the grounds of a school where
              children have access to the street or highway from the school property
              or where an established school crossing is located provided the school
              advance sign prescribed bythe manual onuniformtraffic control devices
              adopted by the commissioner of transportationpursuant to section169.06
              is in place. All signs erected by local authorities to designate speed
              limits in school zones shall conform to the manual on uniform traffic
              control devices.

According to the statute, the Moorhead City Council has the authority to establish special speed
zones in school areas. Prior to implementing a speed zone, an engineering study must be
performed, consisting of two parts: 1) preparing a school route plan, and 2) conducting a school
zone hazard evaluation. A school route plan for the high school is intended to minimize the number
of streets to cross and maximize the safety of the crossing locations (shown in Figure 5). The
school hazard evaluation determines the routes that can be made the safest in the most cost efficient
manner and are most likely to be used by the students. Based on the current MHS and sports center
study, crossings at the mid-blocks of 24th St. and 2nd Ave. S. pose the greatest concerns.

The Metro COG performed a study in 1996 entitled Moorhead Speed Zone Study, which analyzed
speed zones at six elementary schools. The study established traffic control signs and devices to
improve pedestrian safety within the school zone, including school advance signs, school crossing
signs, school speed limit signs, and flashing beacons. A 20 mph speed zone was recommended for
the elementary schools during periods of school pedestrian activity.

Recommendation
A 20 mph speed limit shall be implemented along 24th St., Euclid St., 2nd Ave. S., and the access
road. Signs should be located at each entrance and exit to the campus, as shown in Figure 6, and
comply to the Minnesota MUTCD.

6.1.2. Construct a Mid-Block Crosswalk at 2nd Ave. S. with Speed Humps
A crosswalk at 2nd Ave. S. would provide students, staff, and the general public with a safe
crossing between the high school and parking lot (Figure 7). The survey results indicated that
safety and speed concerns are high along 2nd Ave. S. As stated earlier, when asked about speeding
concerns at other locations besides 24th St., 67 percent of the student respondents and 87 percent of
the non-student respondents indicated 2nd Ave. S. was one of the locations that concerned them.
Another question was asked about other locations that pedestrian and traffic safety issues were
evident. According to the responses, 59 percent of the students and 78 percent of the non-student
respondents stated 2nd Ave. S. was a concern.

To incorporate the crosswalk, a few modifications must be made to the sidewalk and the on-street
parking. On the south side of 2nd Ave S., curb ramps must be constructed to provide access
between the sidewalk and crosswalk, as prescribed by ADA guidelines. On the north side of 2nd
Ave. S., one or two parking spaces will have to be removed, depending on the alignment of the
parking spaces. Since the dislocated spaces are pedestrians spaces, some of the short-term
parking spaces will have to be removed. School advance signs and school crossing signs must
also be incorporated into the crosswalk.

Speed bumps are an abrupt rise in pavement installed to slow down motorists primarily in parking
lots and driveways. Typically, speed bumps have a length of 3 feet and a height of 5-6 inches.
Speed humps are a gradual rise in pavement to reduce traffic speeds and volumes on residential
streets. Speed humps vary in length depending upon the desired speed, typically ranging from 12-
22 feet, and have height of 3-4 inches. Figures 8 and 9 illustrate typical cross-sections and layout
for speed humps and speed bumps, respectively.

Recommendation
Construct a crosswalk adhering to ADA guidelines for sidewalk curb ramps and markings.
Construct speed humps in both directions and install signs as illustrated in Figure 7.

6.1.3. Construct Speed Bumps Near Mid-Block Crosswalk at 24th St.
A raised pedestrian crosswalk was constructed in 1995 at the mid-block of 24th St. to reduce
vehicle speeds at the crossing. The crosswalk has sunk over the years, thus losing the intent of the
structure. Several committee members stated the raised crosswalk was not very effective and
motorists only slowed down as they traveled over the hump. The committee felt measures should
be implemented/constructed to significantly reduce vehicle speeds through the crossing locations.
Since motorists may not obey stop signs at the crossing locations, the committee thought speed
bumps near the crossing locations would be beneficial.

Recommendation
Construct speed bumps in both directions isolating the crosswalk between Moorhead High School
and the Moorhead Sports Center and install signs as illustrated in Figures 7 and 9. Repaint the
crosswalk or investigate other longer lasting pavement markings to raise visual awareness of
crosswalk.

6.1.4. Two-Way Left Turn Lane Along 21st St. S. Between 1st Ave. S. and 4th Ave. S.
The southbound left-turn movement has been prohibited since 1989, however, it continues to be
used by motorists entering the high school. In fact, the left-turn movement provides more vehicles
to the high school during the morning peak period than any other movement. Field observations
showed that traffic used the center lane, which is prohibitively marked for the southbound left-turn
movement. Minor queues developed for the left-turn movement, typically no more than four
vehicles. However, on one occasion, a queue developed that spilled back to the intersection of 1st
Ave. S., which was the main reason for making the left-turn movement illegal. If the left-turn
movement is to remain illegal, a raised median would be needed to ensure compliance.

Ten years of accident data were obtained to evaluate the accident occurrences within the high
school area. Based on this data, none of the 19 accidents at the intersection of 2nd Ave. S. and 21st
St. involved the southbound left-turn movement.

Since the pavement markings and the traffic sign have not been effective in prohibiting the illegal
left turn and accident data illustrates a low accident rate, the movement could be allowed using a
two-way left turn lane (TWLTL). Two-way left turn lanes are usually the center lane of a five-
lane roadway and function well on arterials with moderate traffic levels (10,000 to 28,000
vehicles per day), high turning percentages, and low to moderate commercial driveways.
Therefore, a TWLTL would be well suited on 21st St. S. between 1st Ave. S. and 4th Ave. S. After
implementing a TWLTL, field studies must be performed to examine traffic operations and ensure
traffic queues do not block 1st Ave. S. (Figure 10).

Recommendation
Remove the NO LEFT TURN sign along 21st St. S. and repaint the section from 1st Ave. S. to 4th
Ave. S. as illustrated in Figure 10 and per Minnesota MUTCD guidelines.

6.1.5. Modify the North Parking Lot to One-Way Traffic Circulation
The parking lot creates numerous vehicle/pedestrian conflicts during the high school's start and
dismissal times. Currently, the main parking lot for the high school and sports center provides
two-way circulation. Some vehicles are not properly parked, thereby limiting the amount of space
to maneuver through the aisles. Converting the parking lot to one-way circulation would reduce
the vehicle/pedestrian conflicts and provide adequate aisle spacing, resulting in improved safety
(Figure 11).

Recommendation
Upon completion of the parking lot overlay, reconfigure the pavement markings as illustrated in
Figure 11.

Advanced Traffic Analysis Center
6.1.6. Construct an Additional Parking Lot
Since parking is a critical issue for the high school and sports center, an additional parking lot
could be constructed. A few committee members recommended constructing a parking lot
northeast of the sports center between the fence of the football field and the soccer field. A
preliminary design of a parking lot was performed, providing an additional 74 parking spaces,
including 4 handicapped spaces (Figure 12).

Recommendation
Pursue design and funding for parking lot illustrated in Figure 12.

                                6.2. Short-Term Solution Approval

The short-term solutions, which were supported by the study committee, were presented to the
Moorhead City Council Committee of the Whole Meeting on August 13, 2001. A consensus of the
council members was reached on the first four solutions while waiting to implement the remaining
two solutions at a later time. At the August 20, 2001 Moorhead City Council Meeting, four of the
solutions were adopted by unanimous vote and are being implemented. The fifth solution, which
would change the parking lot circulation to one-way, could be implemented next year after the
parking lot resurfacing is completed. The construction of the additional parking lot will be
implemented at a later date when funds are available. The four approved short-term solutions are
as follows:

·      Establish school speed zones of 20 mph on 24th St., Euclid St., 2nd Ave. S., and the access
       road
·      Construct a mid-block crosswalk at 2nd Ave. S. with speed humps
·      Construct speed bumps near the mid-block crosswalk at 24th St.
·      Implement a two-way left turn lane along 21st St. between 1st Ave. S. and 4th Ave. S.

                                     6.3. Long-Term Solutions

Long-term solutions consist of higher-cost modifications that would be planned for future
implementation. The long-term solutions make modifications to roadway geometry and traffic
circulation. Geometric changes consist of modifying current road alignment, constructing
pedestrian facilities, and creating additional parking. Modification to circulation affect how
traffic flows through the area and includes limited access to selective vehicles, changing the streets
direction of flow, and creating new access to the study area. The following sections will discuss
several of these alternatives.

6.3.1. Redesign 2nd Ave. S. at 21st St. and Euclid St.
This solution was originally proposed in the 1995 Metro COG study. The realignment of 2nd Ave.
S. and Euclid St. would increase traffic flow and decrease motorist confusion (Figure 13). The
west approach of 2nd Ave. S. would be moved to the north, as well as extending the south
approach's west side and median. The combination of these changes would create a typical
intersection.

Advanced Traffic Analysis Center
The intersection of 2nd Ave. S. and 21st St. could also be moved to the south to allow more
distance between 1st Ave. S. and 2nd Ave. S. Throughout the years, the southbound left-turning
movement at 2nd Ave. S. has provided the most vehicles to the high school during the morning and
lunch periods. The proposed design would move the intersection approximately 100 feet to the
south and would provide adequate storage space for a southbound left-turn movement, as well as
allowing for more storage space for the northbound left-turning movement onto 1st Ave. S.

A significant drawback for moving the intersection to the south would be related to the proximity
to the 4th Ave. S. intersection. Section 11-5-7K of the Moorhead City Code states "Access of
local streets onto arterial and collector streets will be discouraged at intervals of less than five
hundred feet (500')." Along 21st St., 1st Ave. S. and 2nd Ave. S. are approximately 300 feet apart
while 2nd Ave. S. and 4th Ave. S. are 500 feet apart. Moving 2nd Ave. S. south 100 feet would not
comply with the city code recommendation, however, it would make the intersection spacing
between the three intersections equal.

6.3.2. Move Parking Lot Entrance to the North
A second alternative regarding the access to 21st St. consists of moving the parking lot entrance to
the north and aligning it with 1st Ave. S. Several modifications would be incorporated for this
alternative, including closing the 2nd Ave. S. access, constructing an access road north west of the
parking lot, and expanding parking to the west side of the school (shown in Figure 14). This
alternative would reduce traffic along 2nd Ave. and 24th St. since motorist could funnel out of the
parking lot using the proposed access road. Additional parking would also be available on the
west side of the high school. This alternative would require the purchase of private property
directly northwest of the high school.

6.3.3. Redesign 2nd Ave. S. and 1st Ave. S. at 21st St.
A third alternative regarding 21st St. access consists of realigning the intersection of 1st Ave. S.
and 2nd Ave. S. at 21st St. (shown in Figure 15). The realignment would result in eliminating one
of the intersections along 21st St. and would also allow for the reconfiguration of 2nd Ave. S. and
Euclid St. The realignment would provide a more beneficial intersection grade compared to the
current location of 1st Ave. S., which would increase safety by improving the motorist's sight
distance. This alternative would also comply with Moorhead's code regarding access
management.

This alternative would require the purchase of private properties on both sides of 21st St. On the
east side of 21st St., land would have to be acquired directly northwest of the high school. Land
would also have to be acquired west of 21st St., which is currently a parking lot of an abandoned
business.
6.3.4. Construct Pedestrian Tunnel/Skywalk Between MHS and Sports Center
According to the two surveys conducted in this study, more respondents selected the pedestrian
tunnel/skywalk to solve the pedestrian safety issues along 24th St. than any other solutions. The
structure would provide the safest method to cross between the high school and sports center;
however, it is unclear whether people would use the structure if is not easily accessible,
especially during warm weather.

6.3.5. Southeast Main Ave./20th/21st St. Railroad Underpass Safety Project
The 2000 study recommended constructing an underpass at the intersection of Main Ave. and
20th/21st St. to increase safety of roadway traffic. Based on the proposed design, a portion of 4th
Ave. S. would have to be reconstructed and lowered for the underpass construction. The
underpass project could provide an excellent opportunity to improve access/circulation within the
high school area.

6.3.6. Limit 24th St. to Service Vehicles
This alternative would limit the traffic on 24th St. to pedestrians, buses, and delivery vehicles.
Although this strategy would enhance pedestrian safety, it would greatly reduce roadway capacity.
Therefore, if this alternative was implemented, the access road would have to be converted to a
two-way facility.

6.3.7. Redesign Access Road to a Two-Way Street
The high school and sports center has limited access to the north and west due to railroad tracks
and private property. The only viable alternative for different traffic circulation is enhancing the
access road around the sports center to accommodate two-way traffic (Figure 16). This
alternative would be feasible if 24th St. was changed to a one-way street or closed to general
traffic. Currently, an irrigation control box, a light pole for the football field, and a fence are
located to the north of the access road. The fence is the closest obstacle to the roadway and is
located about nine feet away. To minimize cost, it was decided by high school and sports center
staff to limit the possible road expansion to the fence line. The access road is approximately 19
feet wide along the north side of the sports center, which does not include curb and gutter. A
typical lane width for an urban street is 10-12 feet, equating to a 20-24 foot roadway. Therefore,
the roadway could be widened to 24 feet without disturbing any existing structures. The east side
of the sports center is approximately 28 feet wide, therefore, it does not need to be to be widened
for two-way traffic.

If the access road was modified for two-way traffic, the on-street parking along the roadway
would have to be eliminated. The preferable width of a parallel parking lane is 10 feet resulting
in a 30-34 foot roadway, which cannot be easily constructed on the north side of the sports center.
The displaced parking, which is about 26 vehicles, could be accommodated in the proposed
parking lot discussed in Section 6.1.6.

                                     6.4. Additional Strategies

Designing and implementing solutions using engineering principles and practices are important
steps for improving pedestrian safety and traffic circulation; however, additional support must be
provided to ensure success. Examples of supportive means includes maintenance, law
enforcement, and student education, which are discussed in the following sections.

6.4.1. Maintenance Issues
Adequate maintenance is necessary for safety and motorist compliance. Pavement markings and
roadway signs are essential to providing guidance for both motorists and pedestrians. Lane,
parking, and crosswalk markings should be maintained throughout the high school area to increase
compliance from both motorists and pedestrians. Pavement markings are difficult to view during

the winter season and they are not very durable; therefore, they must be maintained on a periodic
basis and may require supplemental regulatory and warning signs.

6.4.2. Law Enforcement
Law enforcement is an important component to traffic safety. The high school needs enforcement
primarily during the lunch peaks and the afternoon peak; therefore, it is suggested to have patrol
units at the high school during these peak periods. Enforcement would deter possible problems,
such as speeding through the campus, running stop signs, and failing to yield to pedestrians.

6.4.3. Student Education
Educating students about pedestrian and motor vehicle safety is also important and should also be
conducted at the high school. Students could be shown examples of proper and improper
pedestrian crossings and driver behavior using video of the 24th St. mid-block crossing.


                         7.0. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Pedestrian safety and traffic circulation issues have been a concern for several years around the
Moorhead Senior High School and Moorhead Sports Center. These issues have been evaluated
several times and incremental improvements have been made based on the studies. This report
evaluated the existing conditions and provided short-term and long-term solutions to enhance both
pedestrian safety and traffic circulation. It should be noted that pedestrian safety was identified to
be the more important issue due to the large amount of pedestrian traffic and inexperienced
drivers. The proposed short-term solutions are as follows:

1.     Establish school speed zones of 20 mph on 24th St., Euclid St., 2nd Ave. S., and the access
       road
2.     Construct a mid-block crosswalk at 2nd Ave. S. with speed humps
3.     Construct speed bumps near the mid-block crosswalk at 24th St.
4.     Implement a two-way left turn lane along 21st St. between 1st Ave. S. and 4th Ave. S.
5.     Modify the north parking lot to one-way traffic circulation
6.     Construct an additional parking lot northeast of the sports center

The first four solutions were adopted by the Moorhead City Council and are currently being
implemented. The remaining two solutions will be implemented within the next few years.

Several long-term solutions were identified. Most of these solutions involve geometric changes
along with modifying traffic circulation with a goal of improving pedestrian safety and/or traffic
circulation for the study area and include the following:

·      Redesign 2nd Ave. S. at 21st St. and Euclid St.
·      Move Parking Lot Entrance to the North
·      Redesign 2nd Ave. S. and 1st Ave. S. at 21st St.
·      Construct Pedestrian Tunnel/Skywalk Between MHS and Sports Center
·      Southeast Main Ave./20th/21st St. Railroad Underpass Safety Project
·      Limit 24th St. to Service Vehicles
·      Redesign Access Road to a Two-Way Street

The long-term solutions should be discussed and approved by the committee in the near future and
included into long range transportation plans in order to get appropriate funding. As discussed
earlier, engineering solutions will improve safety and operations of the high school and sports
center are. However, to achieve maximum benefits, law enforcement and student education must
supplement the improvements.

SECTION 1               INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

This Initial Study of environmental impacts is being prepared to conform to the requirements of the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the CEQA Guidelines (California Code of
Regulations 15000 et.seq.) and the regulations and policies of the City of Morgan Hill.

This Initial Study evaluates the environmental impacts that might reasonably be anticipated to result
from implementation of the proposed Hale-Signature project. The project proposes a General Plan
amendment to change the land use designation on the 30-acre site from Public Facilities to Single
Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre). For the purposes of this Initial Study, development at
the upper range of the proposed General Plan designation, or up to 150 residential units, is assumed
on the site.

The applicant has stated an objective to accommodate about 120 dwelling units on the site. Under
Morgan Hill's current general plan designations and zoning regulations, density is calculated based
on gross site area, and therefore the Single Family Medium designation and R1-7,000 zoning would
be the most appropriate categories to accommodate the applicant's project objectives.

The City of Morgan Hill has held public hearings and is preparing to adopt a new "Single Family
High" (5-10 units/acre) general plan land use designation and zoning, along with changes to its
definition of lot area to shift from "gross" to "net" as the basis of calculating density. The new
district would allow for lot sizes of less than 7,000 square feet, such as 5,000 and 6,000 square foot
lots with detached single family units. The Hale-Signature project site will need to accommodate the
Madrone Parkway extension and project roads, Fisher Creek and appropriate creek setbacks, on-site
stormwater detention area, and possible buffers from the UPRR and/or possible park area. Therefore,
the net developable area of the 30 gross acre site may be about 22 net acres, and 120 units on 22
acres would be more than 5 units per acre. It is possible that changes to the definitions of the lot
sizes will be made to the zoning code in the near future and the Hale-Signature project could decide
that the preferred method of achieving the project objectives under the City's new regulations would
be to instead apply the new Single Family High designation and zoning if it is adopted and available
as an option. Currently it is envisioned that the Single Family High designation would have a
minimum lot size of 4,500 square feet.

This Initial Study has assumed a 150-unit project on the site. If a substantially higher number of
dwelling units were to be proposed in the future, then subsequent or supplemental CEQA review will
likely be required to ensure that there are no new or substantially more severe impacts than disclosed
by this Initial Study.

Throughout this Initial Study and in the Transportation Impact Analysis, the description will continue
to reflect the Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre) zoning district, but this will also be
interpreted to include designation as "Single Family High" if that option becomes available and the
applicant modifies the proposed project to that new designation as the preferred method of achieving
the assumed project housing type (about 5 units per gross acre or about 7 units per net acre) that is
analyzed by this Initial Study.

The City of Morgan Hill is the Lead Agency under CEQA and has prepared this Initial Study to
address the impacts of implementing the currently proposed project.

SECTION 3               PROJECT DESCRIPTION

3.1            LOCATION

The approximately 30-acre project site is located between Hale Avenue and Monterey Road one-half
mile south of the intersection of Tilton Avenue and Hale Avenue in Morgan Hill, (refer to Figures 1-
3). The site is surrounded by residential development to the north and south, commercial and
industrial development to the east, and unincorporated rural open space to the west. Union Pacific
Railroad (UPRR) tracks run along the eastern border of the site. Fisher Creek is located between
Hale Avenue and the western border of the site.

3.2             BACKGROUND

The project site was annexed by the City of Morgan Hill in 2002. The site was then prezoned Public
Facilities and a General Plan amendment changed the land use designation from Single Family
Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre) to Public Facilities to facilitate the development of a proposed
private high school. The General Plan amendment also approved an extension of Madrone Parkway
southwest to Hale Avenue from its current terminus at Monterey Road. The Madrone Parkway
extension would be a four-lane divided arterial roadway that would include an at-grade crossing over
the UPRR tracks on the eastern edge of the site. The Morgan Hill Catholic High School Final
Environmental Impact Report (MHCHS FEIR), which analyzed these actions, was certified in 2002.
The application to develop the high school has since been withdrawn. The site is currently vacant
and undeveloped, and the Madrone Parkway extension has not been built.

3.3             PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project proponent proposes a General Plan amendment to change the land use designation on the
site from Public Facilities to Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre), as shown on
Figure 4. This will allow 90 to 150 single-family units on the site. This designation allows as many
as five dwelling units per acre consisting of detached residences with minimum lot areas of 7,000
square feet. The Morgan Hill General Plan describes Single Family Medium land use areas as often
providing a transition from non-residential areas to lower-density neighborhoods. For the purposes
of this Initial Study, development at the upper range of the proposed General Plan designation, or up
to 150 residential units, is assumed on the site.

The applicant has stated an objective to accommodate about 120 dwelling units on the site. Under
Morgan Hill's current general plan designations and zoning regulations, density is calculated based
on gross site area, and therefore the Single Family Medium designation and R1-7,000 zoning would
be the most appropriate categories to accommodate the applicant's project objectives.

The planned Madrone Parkway extension identified in the city's Circulation Element will remain
unchanged by the Hale-Signature project application, but it should be recognized that the City of
Morgan Hill is currently studying a General Plan Circulation Element Amendment to modify the
existing planned 4 lane arterial at-grade crossing of the site, to be a 2 lane arterial grade separated
crossing. The General Plan Land Use Amendment and rezoning of the site can accommodate either
circulation network decision, i.e. to keep the General Plan as it currently exists or to amend it with
regard to the planned Madrone Parkway extension improvement.

3.3.1           Possible Changes to City of Morgan Hill General Plan Designations and Zoning
                Districts

The City of Morgan Hill has held public hearings and is preparing to adopt a new "Single Family
High (5-10 units/acre)" general plan land use designation and zoning, along with changes to its
definition of lot area to shift from "gross" to "net" as the basis of calculating density. The new
district would allow for lot sizes of less than 7,000 square feet, such as 5,000 and 6,000 square foot
lots with detached single family units. The Hale-Signature project site will need to accommodate the
Madrone Parkway extension and project roads, Fisher Creek and appropriate creek setbacks, on-site
stormwater detention area, and possible buffers from the UPRR and/or possible park area. Therefore,
the net developable area of the 30 gross acre site may be about 22 net acres or even less, and 120
units on 22 acres would be more than 5 units per acre. It is possible that changes to the definitions of
the lot sizes will be made to the zoning code in the near future and the Hale-Signature project could
decide that the preferred method of achieving the project objectives under the City's new regulations
would be to instead apply the new Single Family High designation and zoning if it is adopted and
available as an option. Currently it is envisioned that the Single-Family High Density zoning district
would have a minimum lot size of 4,500 square feet.

This Initial Study has assumed a 150-unit project on the site. If a substantially higher number of
dwelling units were to be proposed in the future, then subsequent or supplemental CEQA review will
likely be required to ensure that there are no new or substantially more severe impacts than disclosed
by this Initial Study.

Throughout this Initial Study and in the Transportation Impact Analysis, the description will continue
to reflect the Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre) land use designation and zoning
district, but this will also be interpreted to include designation as "Single Family High" if that option
becomes available and the applicant modifies the proposed project to that new designation as the
preferred method of achieving the assumed project housing type (about 5 units per gross acre or
about 7 units per net acre) that is analyzed by this Initial Study. A comparison of the proposed

SECTION 4                 ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST AND DISCUSSION
                          OF IMPACTS

This section describes the existing environmental conditions on and near the project area, as well as
environmental impacts associated with the proposed project. The environmental checklist, as
recommended in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines, identifies
environmental impacts that could occur if the proposed project is implemented.

The right-hand column in the checklist lists the source(s) for the answer to each question. The
sources cited are identified at the end of this section. Mitigation measures are identified for all
significant project impacts. Measures that are standard and required by the City or law are
categorized as "Standard Measures." Measures that are required to reduce significant impacts to a
less than significant level are categorized as "Mitigation Measures."

4.1             AESTHETICS

4.1.1           Setting

The project site is located in northwest Morgan Hill and consists of flat agricultural land at the base
of the Santa Cruz Mountain range foothills. There are no structures on the site and the site has never
been developed. Although the project site itself is undeveloped, it is surrounded by urban
development on three sides. Views of the project site are limited to the immediate vicinity of the
project site. The most noticeable attribute of the project site is the five large oak trees located in the
northern portion of the site which are of a size that is subject to the Significant Tree provisions of the
Morgan Hill Municipal Code. Views of the project site taken from the western boundary, looking
east towards the City of Morgan Hill, are shown in Photos 1 and 2.

4.1.2.1           Discussion of Impacts

The project proponent proposes a General Plan amendment to change the land use designation on the
site from Public Facilities to Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre). This will allow
the future development of up to 150 single family units on the site. While future development would
change the visual character of the site by allowing for the future development of residential
buildings, these structures would be similar in scale to existing residential development in the project
area, to the north and south. New buildings would modify views of foothill areas from both Hale
Avenue and Monterey Road, but are not anticipated to have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic
vista or scenic resources.

Future residences would incrementally increase light and glare due to the new building surfaces,
vehicles traveling to and from the development, and lighted buildings and streets. These new sources
of light and glare are not considered substantial and would be consistent with the light and glare
currently created by residential buildings, street lights, and automobiles in residential areas to the
north and south. In addition, future development would be reviewed during the City's design permit
process for consistency with the City's design guidelines including the appropriate use of lighting
and avoidance of glare. Implementation of the General Plan amendment, therefore, would not result
in significant, adverse visual or aesthetic impacts.

4.1.2.2           Program Mitigation and Avoidance Measures

                                    City of Morgan Hill General Plan

Various policies in the City's General Plan were adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating
impacts to visual resources resulting from planned development within the City. All future
development is subject to General Plan policies, including the following, which would reduce or
avoid aesthetics impacts:

         Built Environment Policy 12a - Avoid monotony in the appearance of residential
          development.

         Built Environment Policy 12e - Minimize the use of sound walls.

         Neighborhoods Policy 8c - Encourage future residential development projects where local streets
          are safe, convenient and aesthetically pleasing; and where elementary schools and parks are
          centrally located to serve the immediate residential area.

         Water Quality Policy 6h - Preserve and protect mature, healthy trees whenever feasible,
          particularly native trees and other trees which are of significant size or of significant aesthetic
          value to immediate vicinity or to the community as a whole.

4.1.3             Conclusion

The proposed General Plan amendment would not result in significant, adverse visual or aesthetic
impacts. (Less Than Significant Impact)

4.2             AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

4.2.1           Setting

According to the Santa Clara County Important Farmland 2006 Map, the project site is designated
Farmland of Local Importance. Farmland of Local Importance is defined as small orchards and
vineyards primarily in the foothill areas, and also land cultivated as dry cropland for grains and hay.
The site was used for agricultural purposes since at least the 1950's, and has been used for dry
farming of hay in recent years. The site, however, has been fallow for a number of years. The site is
not subject to a Williamson Act contract.

The project site is bordered by commercial and industrial land uses beyond the railroad tracks and
Monterey Highway to the east, single family residences to the north and south, and rural open space
across Hale Avenue to the west. There are no agricultural uses located adjacent to the project site.

4.2.2.1         Impacts from the Proposed Project

The project site is currently designated as Farmland of Local Importance, but is not zoned for
agricultural use. The site, which is bordered by residential, commercial, and industrial development
to the north, south, and east, has been dry farmed for hay as recently as 2001. The proposed General
Plan amendment to change the land use designation on the site from Public Facilities to Single
Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre) would allow for the development of up to150
residential units. Although the project would result in the conversion of farmland to a non-
agricultural use, the current land use designation on the site of Public Facilities also allows for
development that would convert farmland to a non-agricultural use. Furthermore, the existing Public
Facilities designation on the site does not allow for agricultural uses as permitted uses and
agriculture is not specifically listed as a conditional use. The Planning Commission could adopt a
conditional use for "any other use which the Planning Commission finds to be of similar nature to the

permitted or conditional uses specified in this chapter for the PF zoning district" (Morgan Hill
Municipal Code, Chapter 18.19), but the project site is located within the city limits and has long
been planned for urban uses. The project would not convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or
Farmland of Statewide Importance to a non-agricultural use, and would not conflict with existing
zoning for agricultural use or a Williamson Act contract. The site not adjacent to other farmland and
future development would not interfere with other agricultural operations or facilitate the conversion
of farmland elsewhere in the Morgan Hill area to non-agricultural uses. For these reasons, the
project would not result in a significant impact to agricultural resources.

4.2.3           Conclusion

The proposed project would not result in a significant impact to agricultural resources. (Less Than
Significant Impact)

4.3             AIR QUALITY

4.3.1           Setting

4.3.1.1         Local and Regional Air Quality

Air quality and the amount of a given pollutant in the atmosphere are determined by the amount of
pollutant released and the atmosphere's ability to transport and dilute the pollutant. The major
determination of transport and dilution are wind, atmospheric stability, terrain, and for photochemical
pollutants, sun light.

The project site is within the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin. The Bay Area Air Quality
Management District (BAAQMD) is the regional government agency that monitors and regulates air
pollution within the air basin.

Three pollutants are known at times to exceed the state and federal standards in the project area:
ozone, particulates (PM10), and carbon monoxide. Both ozone and PM10 are considered regional
pollutants because their concentrations are not determined by proximity to individual sources, but
show a relative uniformity over a region. Carbon monoxide is considered a local pollutant because
elevated concentrations are usually only found near the source (e.g., congested intersections).

4.3.2.1          Long-Term Air Quality Impacts

According to the CEQA Guidelines prepared and adopted by the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District (BAAQMD), the following criteria must be satisfied for a local general plan to be
determined to be consistent with the most current Clean Air Plan (CAP) and to not, therefore, have a
significant air quality impact:

         The local plan should be consistent with the CAP population and Vehicle Miles Traveled
          (VMT) assumptions. This is demonstrated if the population growth over the planning period
          will not exceed the values included in the current CAP; and

         The local plan demonstrates reasonable efforts to implement the Transportation Control
          Measures (TCMs) included in the CAP that identifies cities as implementing agencies.

The proposed General Plan amendment would allow residential development on the parcel. A
maximum of 150 dwelling units could be constructed on the project site under the proposed land use.
While the General Plan amendment would facilitate residential growth in Morgan Hill, residential
growth in Morgan Hill is ultimately controlled by the Residential Development Control System
(RDCS). By approving Measure C in 2004, Morgan Hill voters extended the City's RDCS to 2020.
The General Plan assumes that some form of residential growth control and the current allowed rate
of about 250 new units per year will continue until 2020, with the end result being a city population
of 48,000, which is slightly below ABAG Projections 2003 and what is assumed in the 2005 CAP.
The General Plan also includes policies to implement identified TCMs. For these reasons,
population growth over the planning period will be consistent with the CAP population and VMT
assumptions and, therefore, would not result in a significant long-term regional air quality impact.

4.3.2.2          Short-Term Air Quality Impacts

Construction-related air quality impacts associated with activities generating dust such as excavation
and grading operations could occur with the future development of residences on the site. The City
of Morgan Hill requires implementation of standard dust control measures (below).

4.3.2.3          Program Mitigation and Avoidance Measures

                               City of Morgan Hill Standard Measure

In accordance with the City of Morgan Hill Standard Conditions of approval, prior to issuance of a
building permit, the owner shall submit to the Planning Division for approval, a management plan
detailing strategies for control of dust during construction of the project. The intent of this condition
is to minimize construction related disturbance of residents of the nearby or adjacent properties.

4.3.2.4          Measures to be Considered at the Time of Future Development

The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) has prepared a list of feasible
construction dust control measures that can reduce construction impacts to a level that is less than
significant. These measures are listed in the BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines. At the time any future
development is considered, these measures, or equivalent measures, should be required as conditions
of approval to reduce the generation of construction dust. Short-term air quality impacts associated
with construction could be reduced to less than significant levels with the implementation of standard
construction measures and mitigation measures identified in the BAAQMD Guidelines.

4.3.3           Conclusion

The proposed project would not result in significant long-term regional or local air quality impacts.
(Less Than Significant Impact)

While possible future uses could result in temporary air quality impacts during construction, it is
assumed that General Plan policies (and mitigation measures recommended in the BAAQMD CEQA
Guidelines) would reduce impacts to a less than significant level. (Less Than Significant Impact)

4.4             BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

The following discussion is based upon a Biological Resources Report prepared in August 2001 by
H.T. Harvey & Associates for the MHCHS FEIR.

4.4.1           Setting

4.4.1.1         On-Site Habitats

Four biotic habitats, as well as developed habitat, were identified on the site. The biotic habitats are
agricultural, ruderal, seasonal drainage, and perennial wetlands. These habitats are described below
and their locations can be seen on Figure 5.

                                              Agricultural

Vegetation

Most of the 30-acre project site was formerly utilized for agricultural purposes, including hay
production. Dominant grasses in the hay field are wheat and wild oats. Other species identified
within the agricultural field include annual ryegrass, meadow barley, California burclover, redstem
filaree, black mustard, bristly ox-tongue, yellow star thistle, English plantain, field bindweed, and
American vetch. In addition, five large oak trees were identified within the agricultural field.

Wildlife

Many wildlife species will use this type of habitat when the vegetation is tall. Once it has been cut,
however, cover and forage are reduced. Bird species such as the red-winged blackbird and song
sparrow will nest in the fields when the vegetation is tall, and will use the field for foraging all year.
The ruderal vegetation around the perimeter of the site increases wildlife use, because it provides
cover for species that may forage there or in open fields, including mourning dove, European
starling, and northern mockingbird. Norway rats and black rats will forage in agricultural fields.
Many of the species listed below under ruderal habitat also use agricultural fields for foraging.

                                                 Ruderal

Vegetation

Two patches of ruderal habitat exist along the inside of the western fence line of the project site.
Pieces of scrap iron have been placed in these small patches and, as a result, these areas are not used
for hay production. Ruderal habitat also exists along the eastern edge of Hale Avenue, and on both
sides of a 150-foot long segment of the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, as shown on Figure 5.
Ruderal habitat includes Italian thistle, fiddleneck, ryegrass, meadow barley, California burclover,
wild oat, black mustard, and bristly ox-tongue.

Wildlife

Mammals using this habitat include black-tailed hares, western harvest mouse, California voles, and
house mice. California ground squirrels and Botta's pocket gophers burrow within the ruderal
habitat, where they are protected from agricultural activities. Gopher snakes and western fence
lizards will make use of these mammal burrows for shelter and reproduction. Bird species include

                                          Seasonal Drainage

Vegetation

A seasonal drainage (Fisher Creek) is located along the entire length of the western boundary of the
project site. The total area of this habitat type within the project site is approximately 0.52 acres.
Although the drainage was dry at the time of the field survey, there is evidence of past high flows,
including debris within the vegetation and water-stained vegetation. The majority of species
identified within the seasonal drainage are more commonly associated with upland non-native
grassland habitat. These species include wild oat, bristly ox-tongue, field bindweed, and American
vetch. The channel bed does contain sparse cover of several wetland species associated with more
water related habitats, including nutsedge, rush, willow herb, spikerush, and curly dock. In addition,
several shrub species were identified along the banks of the drainage including Himalayan
blackberry, silver wattle, and coyote brush.

Wildlife

Much of the vegetation in the drainage channel offers similar habitat for wildlife species as the
ruderal vegetation does, however, the presence of shrub species increases habitat value through
increased forage, shelter, and nesting opportunities. Species such as bushtits, Anna's hummingbirds,
and house finches will nest in these types of shrubs. Pacific tree frogs will use the shrubs and other
vegetation all year for shelter, but will also use the drainage during the wet season for breeding sites.

                                          Perennial Wetland

Vegetation

The project site supports 0.03 acres of perennial wetland habitat. It is located in the southernmost
extent of the seasonal drainage, in the southwest corner of the project site (as shown on Figure 5).
Dominant species identified within the wetland habitat include narrow-leaved cattail, willow-herb,
curly dock, American sloughgrass, ditch beard grass, nutsedge, rush, and canary grass.

Wildlife

Although this wetland area is small, it offers habitat to a wide variety of wildlife species. Red-
winged blackbirds, marsh wrens, and song sparrows may be found here during the winter migration,
and may even nest in this habitat. While flooded, this habitat provides wintering habitat for
American pipits as well as many other wintering and migrating songbirds. Western meadowlarks,
barn swallows, and great egrets will forage in this habitat. When flooded, many species of ducks and
herons, such as great-blue herons could forage in these wetlands.

4.4.1.2         Special-Status Plants and Animals

Special-status plant and animal species include federal and State of California listed threatened and
endangered species, federal and state proposed, candidate, threatened or endangered species, State of
California fully protected species, and species that may be considered endangered or rare under
Section 15380(d) of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Several special-status plant
and animal species have been identified as historically or currently occurring in the vicinity of the

project site, according to the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) inventory and the California
Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB). Expanded descriptions are included below only for those
species for which potential breeding habitat occurs on the project site, for which specific surveys
have been completed, or for which the resource agencies have expressed particular concern.

                                     Special Status Plant Species

Most of the special status plant species that occur in the vicinity of the project site are found in
habitat types that are not present on the project site. There is only one special status plant species
that may occur on the site, Congdon's tarplant.

Congdon's tarplant

Congdon's tarplant generally occurs on alkaline soils within valley and foothill grassland habitat.
The California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) Rarefind Database shows no occurrences of
this species within the project vicinity. The blooming period of this annual herb is from June through
November. This species was not detected during reconnaissance level surveys completed within the
blooming period in 2001, however, further surveys for this species are warranted during August and
September.

                                    Special Status Animal Species

Reconnaissance level field surveys were completed on the site in early June 2001 for any special
status wildlife species, or habitats capable of supporting such species. There are several special
status animal species known to occur in habitats that are present on the site or that may forage in the
project area, but are not expected to breed on site and therefore, will not be significantly impacted by
site development. These special status species include sharp-shinned hawk, cooper's hawk, golden
eagle, merlin, California yellow warbler, long-eared owl, California horned lark, and the pallid bat.

Several special status animal species are known to occur in the area, but are thought to be absent
from the project site due to a lack of habitat, or are thought or known to occur only rarely as stray
migrants or transients. Therefore, the project is not expected to result in significant impacts to these
species. These include the American peregrine falcon, Townsend's big-eared bat, California tiger
salamander, and the California red-legged frog.

Expanded descriptions are included below for those species for which potentially suitable breeding
habitat occurs on the project site. Marginally suitable habitat for nesting raptors and loggerhead
shrike is located on and adjacent to the project site in ruderal habitat and in the large oak trees, as
described below.

Northern Harrier

The northern harrier is commonly found in open grasslands, agricultural areas, and marshes. Nests
are built on the ground in areas where long grasses provide cover and protection. Harriers hunt for a
variety of prey, including rodents, birds, frogs, reptiles, and insects, by flying low and slow in a
traversing manner utilizing both sight and sound to detect prey. Northern harriers have been
observed in the project vicinity and potential nesting habitat for this species occurs in the tall
herbaceous vegetation adjacent to the site or within ruderal habitat on the site.

White-tailed Kite

White-tailed kites prefer habitats with low ground cover and variable tree growth. Kite nests are
built near the tops of oaks, willows, or other dense broad-leafed deciduous trees in partially cleared
or cultivated fields, grassy foothills, marsh, riparian, woodland, and savannah. Kites prey primarily
on small rodents (especially California vole), but also feed on birds, insects, reptiles, and amphibians.
When prey is abundant, these birds may rear two broods in a single breeding season. Once
considered endangered in the State, the fully protected kite is now fairly common. White-tailed kites
have been observed in the project vicinity, and suitable breeding habitat exists in the taller trees on
the site.

Saltmarsh Common Yellowthroat

The saltmarsh common yellowthroat is currently a California Species of Special Concern. This
species inhabits emergent vegetation and breeds in freshwater and brackish marshes and associated
upland areas in the San Francisco Bay Area. This species often produces two clutches per year with
breeding populations recorded in marshes in San Mateo, San Francisco, Napa, Sonoma, Solano,
Marin, and Santa Clara Counties. The saltmarsh common yellowthroat breeds in bayside marshes
and nearby associated riparian and scrubby vegetation. The extent that this species occurs upstream
before being replaced by a more widespread subspecies in the South Bay is unclear. It is not possible
to identify this species in the field without collecting them, however, there is marginal breeding and
foraging habitat on the site. Therefore, this species could be present on the site.

Burrowing Owl

The burrowing owl is a small, terrestrial owl of open country. Burrowing owls favor flat, open
grassland or gentle slopes and sparse shrubland ecosystems. These owls prefer annual and perennial
grasslands, typically with sparse, or nonexistent, tree or shrub canopies. In California, burrowing
owls are found in close association with California ground squirrels. Owls use ground squirrel
burrows for shelter and nesting. In the absence of ground squirrel populations, habitats soon become
unsuitable for occupancy by owls. The nesting season burrowing owl, as recognized by the CDFG,
runs from February 1 through August 31.

As habitats become surrounded by human development, they become increasingly inhospitable to
burrowing owls. Burrowing owl populations are thought to be declining throughout much of their
range in the United States and Canada. Loss of habitat and campaigns against ground squirrels are
suspected causes of this decline. In California, the burrowing owl has been designated as a Species
of Special Concern, due to diminishing habitats and concurrent population declines.

Reconnaissance-level surveys were completed on the site for burrowing owls. While no owls or
evidence of use of the site by owls were found, owls are known to be located within the project area.
The site characteristics are consistent with nesting and/or foraging habitat for burrowing owls.

Loggerhead Shrike

The loggerhead shrike is a predatory bird that forages in grasslands or ruderal habitats for small
reptiles, mammals, birds, and insects and nests in small trees and shrubs. In approximately the last
20 years, populations of loggerhead shrike in eastern North America have declined significantly.
Although loggerhead shrikes are still considered a fairly common species in much of California, the
piecemeal loss of grasslands has caused local declines in many areas, and the species as a whole is
declining in the state.

City of Morgan Hill                                                                          Initial Study
Hale-Signature                                     22                                        August 2009
Loggerhead shrikes have been observed on and adjacent to the project site. Suitable nesting and
foraging habitat for this species, which includes trees and shrubs with an understory of herbaceous
vegetation, is present on the site.

4.4.1.3         Waters of the United States

A reconnaissance-level survey of the site was completed in August 2001 for areas that meet the
regulatory definition of Waters of the United States (jurisdictional waters). Potential wetlands were
identified at the southernmost end of the seasonal drainage (Fisher Creek) located in the southwest
corner of the project site, as shown on Figure 5. These potential wetlands are dominated by plants
that either prefer or require water. The total surface area of these wetlands is 0.03 acres. Tributary
waters, as defined by the ordinary high water (OHW) mark on opposing channel banks of the
seasonal drainage channel totaled 0.56 acres.

4.4.1.4         California Department of Fish and Game Jurisdiction

The project site was examined for those areas within the bed, bank, and channel of the seasonal
drainages that are under the regulatory jurisdiction of the CDFG. These areas generally include
rivers, streams, creeks, or lakes. In addition, canals, aqueducts, irrigation ditches, and other means of
water conveyance can also be considered streams if they support aquatic life, riparian vegetation, or
stream-dependent terrestrial wildlife.

Based on the physical characteristics of the site, the criteria used to identify CDFG jurisdiction was
the top-of-bank or opposing channel banks of Fisher Creek. Approximately 1.19 acres of potential
CDFG jurisdictional habitat was identified along the seasonal drainage, including 0.03 acres of
wetland habitat, as shown on Figure 5.

4.4.1.5         Significant Trees

The City of Morgan Hill Restrictions on Removal of Significant Trees defines a significant tree as
non-native trees equal to or greater than 40 inches in circumference and native trees equal to or
greater than 18 inches in circumference. All trees are to be measured at 4.5 feet above the ground or
immediately below the lowest branch, whichever is lowest. A tree removal permit from the City of
Morgan Hill, or approval to remove trees as part of an approved development plan, is required for the
removal of significant trees.

A tree survey completed on the site identified a total of five oak trees. All of these trees are
considered significant trees, as defined by the City of Morgan Hill, and are protected by the City's
Tree Ordinance. The location of these trees is shown on Figure 6 on the following page and Table
4.4-1 provides a description of the trees. The numbers on Figure 6 correspond to the numbers in
Table 4.4-1.

4.4.1.6             Santa Clara Valley Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural Community Conservation
                    Plan (HCP/NCCP)

A HCP/NCCP is currently being prepared for the Santa Clara Valley. The Santa Clara Valley
HCP/NCCP is a regional partnership between six local partners (the County of Santa Clara, Santa
Clara Valley Transportation Authority, Santa Clara Valley Water District, and the Cities of San Jose,
Gilroy and Morgan Hill) and three wildlife agencies (the California Department of Fish and Game,
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS-NOAA
Fisheries). The HCP/NCCP process is anticipated to be completed in 2010.

The HCP/NCCP will address listed species and species that are likely to become listed during the
plan's 50-year permit term. The species of concern include, but are not limited to, the California tiger
salamander, California red-legged frog, western burrowing owl, Bay checkerspot butterfly, and a
number of species endemic to serpentine grassland and scrub. An administrative draft version of the
HCP/NCCP is currently available for review. 1 Of the 30 species currently being considered in the
Habitat Plan, several species may be present in the project vicinity. These include, but are not
limited to, burrowing owl, big-scale balsamroot, golden eagle, and Townsend's western big-eared
bat.

4.4.2.1         Impacts from the Proposed Project

                                     Impacts to Existing Habitat

Agricultural

Future construction of residential units on the project site would result in the conversion of
approximately 30 acres of agricultural habitat into developed land. The flora associated with this
habitat is common and regionally abundant. The loss of dry-farmed agricultural habitat is not likely
to adversely affect any wildlife species, as the site has been actively cultivated and/or disturbed by
vegetation removal for weed abatement and fire management purposes on a regular basis. The loss
of agricultural habitat would, therefore, be a less than significant impact. The loss of this habitat
would, however, result in the loss of burrowing owl habitat, as discussed below.

Ruderal Habitat

Ruderal habitat identified within the project site is well represented in the project area. The flora
associated with this habitat is common throughout the region. In addition, most wildlife species
associated with ruderal habitats are common throughout the region, with the exception of burrowing
owls and loggerhead shrike. Impacts to these species are considered separately, below. Therefore,
the loss of this habitat is considered a less than significant impact.

                                   Impacts to Special-Status Plants

Most of the special-status plants that occur in regional habitats similar to those found on site were
dismissed as potentially occurring, due to the absence of characteristic habitat and/or microhabitat
requirements. The only species regarded as potentially occurring on-site is Congdon's tarplant,
however, protocol-level surveys have not yet been completed to confirm its presence or absence.
Future development on the site could result in significant impacts to Congdon's tarplant.

Impact BIO-1: Future residential development on the site could result in significant impacts to
Congdon's tarplant. (Significant Impact)

                              Impacts to Special Status Animal Species

The project site is outside the known distribution of several of the special status animal species, as
described previously. Species which could breed on the project site include the northern harrier,
saltmarsh common yellowthroat, white-tailed kite, burrowing owl, and loggerhead shrike as
described below.

Nesting Raptors and Loggerhead Shrike

Raptors (northern harrier and white-tailed kite) and loggerhead shrike, and their nests are protected
under both federal and state laws and regulations. Marginally suitable breeding sites for nesting
raptors are located on and adjacent to the site in ruderal habitat and in the large oak trees. Future
construction activities on the site could result in the destruction of nests and/or disturbance of nesting
raptors and/or loggerhead shrike.




City of Morgan Hill                                                                           Initial Study
Hale-Signature                                      27                                        August 2009
Impact BIO-2: Construction activities associated with future residential development on the site
could result in the destruction of nests and/or disturbance of nesting raptors and/or loggerhead shrike.
(Significant Impact)

Burrowing Owls

Reconnaissance-level surveys were completed in 2001 that determined there are no burrowing owls
on the site. The site characteristics are, however, consistent with burrowing owl nesting and foraging
habitat, and owls are known to occur in the project area. Therefore, disturbances associated with
future construction on the site during the breeding season could result in the incidental loss of fertile
eggs or nestlings or otherwise lead to nest abandonment. The destruction of occupied burrowing owl
burrows could also result in the destruction of individual birds. Any loss of burrowing owls or fertile
eggs, any activities resulting in nest abandonment, or the destruction of occupied burrowing owl
burrows would constitute a significant impact. Future development on the project site would also
result in the loss of burrowing owl nesting and foraging habitat within the project area and the City of
Morgan Hill, in general.

Impact BIO-3: Construction activities associated with future residential development on the site
could result in significant impacts to burrowing owls. (Significant Impact)

Impact BIO-4: Future residential development on the site would result in the loss of burrowing owl
nesting and foraging habitat. (Significant Impact)

Saltmarsh Common Yellowthroat

Saltmarsh common yellowthroats are fairly common in wetland vegetation, such as that found on the
project site. The loss of wetland areas, earth-moving, or other activities that physically alter
vegetation used for nesting could result in direct impacts to nests of this species and construction
work in proximity to active nests could potentially disturb adults to the point of nest abandonment.
Destruction or abandonment of nests of this species would constitute a significant impact.

Impact BIO-5: Future residential development on the site, and related construction activities, could
result in the destruction or abandonment of saltmarsh common yellowthroat nests. (Significant
Impact)

                                    Loss of Ordinance Size Trees

Future development on the site may result in the loss of up to five native ordinance-size oak trees, as
previously described. The loss of these trees would be considered a significant impact.

Impact BIO-6: The removal of ordinance size trees by future residential development on the site
would result in a significant impact. (Significant Impact)

4.2.2.3         Program Mitigation and Avoidance Measures

                                 City of Morgan Hill General Plan

Various policies in the City's General Plan were adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating
impacts to biological resources resulting from planned development within the City. All future

development is subject to General Plan policies, including the following, which would reduce or
avoid impacts to biological resources:

       Plants and Wildlife Policy 6a  Preserve all fish and wildlife habitats in their natural state
        whenever possible. Consider development impacts upon wildlife and utilize actions to
        mitigate those environmental impacts.

       Plants and Wildlife Policy 6c - Preserve outstanding natural features, such as the skyline of a
        prominent hill, rock outcroppings, and native and/or historically significant trees.

       Plants and Wildlife Policy 6e - Identify and protect wildlife, rare and endangered plants and
        animals and heritage resources from loss and destruction.

       Plants and Wildlife Policy 6g - Encourage use of native plants, especially drought-resistant
        species in landscaping to the extent possible.

       Water Quality Policy 6f  Require the protection and/or replacement of essential habitat for
        rare, threatened, or endangered species and species of special concern as required by state
        and federal law.

       Water Quality Policy 6g  Encourage the protection, restoration, and enhancement of
        remaining native grasslands, oak woodlands, marshlands, and riparian habitat.

       Water Quality Policy 6h  Preserve and protect mature, healthy trees whenever feasible,
        particularly native trees and other trees which are of significant size or of significant aesthetic
        value to immediate vicinity or to the community as a whole.

                      City of Morgan Hill Burrowing Owl Habitat Mitigation Plan

In conformance with the City's Burrowing Owl Habitat Mitigation Plan, future development on the
project site will be required to implement the following measures to avoid direct impacts to
burrowing owls and to offset impacts to non-native grassland habitat. Implementation of this
standard measure would avoid or reduce significant impacts to burrowing owls and their habitat.

       Complete pre-construction surveys to determine if burrowing owls are present within the
        footprint of the proposed grading area, no more than 30 days prior to initiation of any
        construction-related activities.

       Should burrowing owls be found on the site during breeding season (February 1 through
        August 31), exclusion zones with a 250-foot radius from occupied burrows, shall be
        established. All project-related activities shall occur outside the exclusion area until the
        young have fledged.

       If preconstruction surveys are completed during the non-breeding season and burrowing owls
        are observed on the site, the owls may be relocated upon approval of the California
        Department of Fish and Game once mitigation has been provided.

       A final report on burrowing owls, including any protection measures, shall be submitted to
        the Director of Community Development prior to grading.



City of Morgan Hill                                                                           Initial Study
Hale-Signature                                      29                                        August 2009
                                 City of Morgan Hill Municipal Code

       Prior to the removal of any tree protected under the City of Morgan Hill Tree Removal
        Controls, a tree removal permit would be required from the Community Development
        Director which would include a description of the tree replacement program and identify any
        conditions imposed by the City. Tree removal may also occur without a permit if the
        removal will take place in accordance with an approved landscape plan. [Morgan Hill
        Municipal Code 12.32.030, 12.32.040, 12.32.060]

       Native trees shall be planted to replace native trees removed unless practical reasons preclude
        this option, as determined by the Community Development Director. [Morgan Hill
        Municipal Code 12.32.080(A)]

       No building shall be constructed within 50 feet of a perennial or intermittent stream [Morgan
        Hill Municipal Code 18.12.080(E)]. The draft Santa Clara Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP)
        proposes to modify this standard to a 35-foot setback from the top of the bank or outer edge
        of riparian vegetation. If this provision is adopted, the Municipal Code will likely be
        amended to be consistent with the HCP.

                                Morgan Hill City Council Policy 05-02

In July 2005, the Morgan Hill City Council adopted an interim City Council policy that applies to
new development adjacent to streams and waterways:

       City Council Policy 05-02 - New development adjacent to streams and waterways shall be
        designed to preserve and integrate the waterways and associated habitats. New development
        should respect the water resource as an asset to the development, and shall not wall off the
        stream or waterway. New development shall incorporate open space buffers adjacent to
        waterways, in order to protect the stream and the existing/potential natural resources and
        habitats contained therein. Trails, pedestrian pathways and/or bikeways should be included
        within the open space buffer, either as reflected in the City's Park and Bikeways Master Plan
        or when reasonable and appropriate. Conditions of approval may be imposed to require
        restoration of riparian habitat, as feasible.

        This policy shall apply to land adjacent to streams and waterways which have value as
        natural and/or recreational resources, including Llagas, West Little Llagas, Edmundson,
        Fisher, Tennant, Corralitos and Coyote Creeks, as well as the Madrone and Butterfield
        Channels.

            Federal and State Laws and Regulations Protecting Wetlands and Creeks

Section 401 and 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act

At the federal level, the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344) is the primary law regulating impacts to
wetlands and waters. The Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into
waters of the United States, including wetlands. Waters of the United States include navigable
waters, interstate waters, territorial seas, and other waters that may be used in the interstate or foreign
commerce. The Section 404 permit program is run by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE)
with oversight from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Future impacts to regulated
wetlands or waters due to construction will require conformance with an ACOE permit and
mitigation requirements to offset impacts. Prior to any construction activities, including filling or

City of Morgan Hill                                                                            Initial Study
Hale-Signature                                      30                                         August 2009
excavation within waters of the United States, a Section 404 permit will be obtained from the ACOE
and a Water Quality Certification would be obtained from the Regional Water Quality Control Board
(RWQCB). The RWQCBs were established under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act to oversee
water quality in the State of California and the RWQCB issues water quality certification in
compliance with Section 401 of the Clean Water Act where impacts to wetlands are proposed.
Potential Waters of the United States on the project site include perennial wetland associated with
Fisher Creek located in southwestern portion of the site.

California Fish and Game Code

The California Fish and Game Code includes regulations governing the use of or impacts to many of
the state's fish, wildlife, and sensitive habitats. The California Department of Fish and Game
(CDFG) exerts jurisdiction over the bed and banks of rivers, lakes, and streams according to
provisions of Section 1601 through 1603 of the Fish and Game Code. The Fish and Game Code
requires a Streambed Alteration Agreement for the fill or removal of material within the bed and
banks of a watercourse or water body and for the removal of riparian vegetation. Future
development on the site will be required to conform to the requirements of Fish and Game Code and
replacement habitat will be required where there are impacts to riparian vegetation.

          Federal and State Laws and Regulations Protecting Migratory and Nesting Birds

The federal Migratory Bird Treaty (MBTA; 16 U.SC., Section 703, Supplement I, 1989) prohibits the
killing, possessing, or trading of migratory birds except in accordance with regulations prescribed by
the Secretary of the Interior. The trustee agency that addresses issues related to the MBTA is the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Migratory birds protected under this law include all native
birds and certain game birds (e.g., turkeys and pheasants). This act encompasses whole birds, parts
of birds, and bird nests and eggs. The MBTA protects active nests (i.e., contains eggs or fledglings)
from destruction and all nests of species protected by the MBTA. All native bird species occurring
in the City of Morgan Hill are protected by the MBTA.

California Fish and Game Code

All native bird species that occur on the project site are protected by the Fish and Game Code. The
California Fish and Game Code protects native birds, including their nests and eggs, from all forms
of take, which includes disturbance that causes nest abandonment and/or loss of the reproductive
effort. Raptors (i.e., eagles, hawks, falcons, and owls) and their nests are specifically protected in
California under Fish and Game Code section 3503.5. Section 3503.5 states that it is "unlawful to
take, possess, or destroy any birds in the order of Falconiformes or Stringiformes (birds of prey) or to
take, possess, or destroy the nest or eggs of any such bird except as otherwise provided in this code
or regulation adopted pursuant thereto." Future development on the project site may be required to
include measures to avoid impacts to nesting birds.

4.2.2.4          Measures to be Considered at the Time of Future Development

                         Measures to Avoid Impacts to Congdon's Tarplant

Implementation of the following mitigation measures at the time of future development could reduce
impacts to Congdon's tarplant to a less than significant level:

         Protocol-level surveys during the blooming period of June through November should be
          completed to determine if Congdon's tarplant exists on the project site. If Congdon's tarplant

City of Morgan Hill                                                                         Initial Study
Hale-Signature                                      31                                      August 2009
        is found within or directly adjacent to the proposed work area, a species specific
        determination of potential significance should be completed by a qualified plant ecologist. If
        the determination, as completed by a qualified plant ecologist with familiarity of Congdon's
        tarplant populations, results in a less than significant conclusion, none of the following
        mitigation measures need to be implemented for project-related impacts.

       If project-related impacts are found to be significant, implementation of the following
        mitigation measures would reduce project-related impacts to Congdon's tarplant to a less than
        significant level:

               The project would be designed, constructed, and operated in such a way as to avoid
                direct and indirect impacts to Congdon's tarplant. This would be done after
                consultation with a plant ecologist.

               In order to reduce indirect impacts to this species (if found on or adjacent to the site),
                a buffer zone would be created during and after construction which is large enough to
                eliminate potential disturbance to the plants from human activity and any other
                potential sources. Temporary fences would be constructed between the development
                and any populations of tarplant.

               If the project cannot be designed to avoid significant impacts to a plant population,
                then a Site Restoration Plan would be developed for the impacted population. The
                objective of this Plan would be to replace the plants and habitat lost during project
                implementation.

               If the implementation of a Site Restoration Plan is not possible, an off site area or
                areas, which already supports a native population of Congdon's tarplant would be
                purchased and set aside in perpetuity. This preservation can be in the form of
                acquisition, deed restriction, or conservation easement that effectively prevents future
                disturbance of off site populations.

             Measures to Avoid Impacts to Nesting Raptors and Loggerhead Shrike

Implementation of the following mitigation measures at the time of future development could reduce
impacts to nesting raptors and loggerhead shrike to a less than significant level:

       Construction should be scheduled to avoid the nesting season to the extent feasible. The
        nesting season for most raptors in the South San Francisco Bay area extends from January
        through August. Therefore, if construction can be scheduled to occur between September
        and December, the nesting season would be avoided, and no impacts would be expected. If it
        is not possible to schedule construction outside of the breeding season, then the following
        mitigation measure should be implemented.

       Pre-construction surveys for nesting raptors and shrikes should be completed by a qualified
        ornithologist or wildlife biologist to ensure that no nests would be disturbed during project
        construction. This survey should be completed no more than 14 days prior to the initiation of
        construction activities during the early part of the breeding season (January through April)
        and no more than 30 days prior to the initiation of these activities during the late part of the
        breeding season (May through August). During this survey, a qualified biologist should
        inspect all trees on and immediately adjacent to the impact areas for nests. If an active nest is

        found close enough to the construction area to be disturbed by these activities (250 feet), the
        ornithologist, in consultation with CDFG, should determine the extent of a construction-free
        buffer zone to be established around the nest.

       Trees on the project site should be removed during the non-nesting season after pre-
        construction surveys are completed to ensure that nesting raptors and/or their nests would not
        be adversely affected as a result of the project.

                Measures to Avoid Impacts to Saltmarsh Common Yellowthroats

Implementation of the following mitigation measures at the time of future development could reduce
impacts to breeding yellowthroats to a less than significant level:

       Saltmarsh common yellowthroats nest from early March to mid-August. If construction in
        proximity to potential nesting habitat can be scheduled to occur between mid-August through
        February, the nesting season would be avoided, and no impacts to nesting yellowthroats
        would occur. Further, it is recommended that all vegetation be cleared during the non-
        breeding season if construction is to occur between early March and mid-August. The site
        should be maintained during the construction period so no vegetation is present for nesting
        yellowthroats. If vegetation is removed, no impacts to nesting yellowthroats would be
        expected.

       If construction does commence between February through mid-August near potential nesting
        habitat, preconstruction surveys for nesting saltmarsh common yellowthroats would be
        conducted by a qualified ornithologist in order to ensure that no nests or colonies are
        disturbed. The surveys for saltmarsh common yellowthroats would occur no more than 15
        days prior to the initiation of construction. If common yellowthroat nests are found to be
        present within or near the construction impact areas, a construction-free buffer around any
        active nest would be established, the width of this buffer being determined by an experienced
        ornithologist in consultation with the CDFG. This buffer would be respected until nesting
        has been completed.

4.4.3           Conclusion

Implementation of the General Plan policies and program mitigation measures above would avoid or
mitigate substantial impacts to biological resources at the time of possible future development. (Less
Than Significant Impact With Mitigation Incorporated)

4.5                CULTURAL RESOURCES

The following discussion is based upon an archaeological literature review and field inspection of the
project site by completed in July 2001 by Holman & Associates, Archaeological Consultants for the
MHCHS FEIR.

4.5.1              Setting

According to the City of Morgan Hill Archaeological Sensitivity Map dated April 2000, the project
site is located within an identified archaeologically sensitive area. 2 An archaeological literature
review was completed in 2001 by Holman & Associates, Archaeological Consultants at the
Northwest Information Center, located at the Sonoma State University campus. The literature review
was completed to determine if any historic or prehistoric sites have been recorded on the project site
or in the project vicinity. The maps of the project area revealed no recorded historic or prehistoric
sites on the project site. There is one historic archaeological site recorded just to the north of the
project site. In addition, one other archaeological survey was completed in the immediate project
vicinity, and found no evidence of resources.

A field inspection of the project site was completed by walking over the entire site to inspect it for
surficial evidence of prehistoric cultural resources. Special attention was paid to the western
boundary of the site along Fisher Creek. There was no evidence of either historic or prehistoric
archaeological resources found on the project site. The historic site located just north of the project
site does not visibly extend into the project area.

4.5.2.1           Impacts from the Proposed Project

Based upon the results of the literature review of archaeological resources and the field inspection,
there is a low potential for the project to impact subsurface prehistoric and/or cultural resources on
the site. It is possible, however, that earthmoving activities associated with future residential
development on the site could uncover some evidence of prehistoric occupation.

4.5.2.2           Program Mitigation and Avoidance Measures

                                  City of Morgan Hill Municipal Code

In accordance with the City of Morgan Hill Municipal Code Chapter 18.75, proposals for the
development of a site identified as archaeologically sensitive by the City's adopted archaeological
sensitivity map shall be subject to the following review process and standard conditions of project
approval:

         The City will consult with the Northwest Information Center for information about whether
          proposed development is located within or adjacent to a known archaeological site, and if it is
          determined that it is so located, then a historical alteration permit is required for the project,
          and subsequent CEQA review of the project shall consider potentially significant impacts on
          archaeological resources and identify appropriate mitigation measures to be imposed as
          conditions of approval in addition to the standard conditions identified below.

         If the project is not located within or adjacent to a known archaeological site, but is located
          within the mapped archaeologically sensitive area as adopted by the City, then the project
          applicant has the option to either have an archaeological survey be completed for the site to
          determine what, if any, conditions of approval will be required as mitigation measures; or
          agree to comply with the following standard conditions of approval, which shall be
          conclusively deemed to reduce potentially significant impacts on archaeological resources to
          a less than significant level (no archaeological resources report is required as part of any
          CEQA review of the project as long as the applicant accepts these conditions and
          incorporates them into the project):

                 An archaeologist shall be present on-site to monitor all ground-disturbing activities.
                  Where historical or archaeological artifacts are found, work in areas where remains or
                  artifacts are found will be restricted or stopped until proper protocols are met, as
                  described below:

                          Work at the location of the find will halt immediately within thirty feet of the
                          find. If an archaeologist is not present at the time of the discovery, the
                          applicant shall contact an archaeologist for evaluation of the find to determine
                          whether it qualifies as a unique archaeological resource as defined by this
                          chapter;
                          If the find is determined not to be a Unique Archaeological Resource,
                          construction can continue. The archaeologist will prepare a brief informal
                          memo/letter that describes and assesses the significance of the resource,
                          including a discussion of the methods used to determine significance for the
                          find;
                          If the find appears significant and to qualify as a unique archaeological
                          resource, the archaeologist will determine if the resource can be avoided and
                          will detail avoidance procedures in a formal memo/letter; and

                        If the resource cannot be avoided, the archaeologist shall develop within
                        forty-eight hours an action plan to avoid or minimize impacts. The field crew
                        shall not proceed until the action plan is approved by the community
                        development director. The action plan shall be in conformance with
                        California Public Resources Code 21083.2.

       All development projects located within an archaeological sensitivity area and/or containing
        known archaeological resources on-site shall also be subject to the following measures as
        standard conditions of project approval:

               This project may adversely impact undocumented human remains or unintentionally
                discover significant historic or archaeological materials. The following policies and
                procedures for treatment and disposition of inadvertently discovered human remains
                or archaeological materials shall apply. If human remains are discovered, it is
                probable they are the remains of Native Americans.

                        If human remains are encountered they shall be treated with dignity and
                        respect as due to them. Discovery of Native American remains is a very
                        sensitive issue and serious concern. Information about such a discovery shall
                        be held in confidence by all project personnel on a need to know basis. The
                        rights of Native Americans to practice ceremonial observances on sites, in
                        labs and around artifacts shall be upheld.
                        Remains should not be held by human hands. Surgical gloves should be worn
                        if remains need to be handled.
                        Surgical mask should also be worn to prevent exposure to pathogens that may
                        be associated with the remains.

               In the event that known or suspected Native American remains are encountered or
                significant historic or archaeological materials are discovered, ground-disturbing
                activities shall be immediately stopped. Examples of significant historic or
                archaeological materials include, but are not limited to, concentrations of historic
                artifacts (e.g., bottles, ceramics) or prehistoric artifacts (chipped chert or obsidian,
                arrow points, groundstone mortars and pestles), culturally altered ash-stained midden
                soils associated with pre-contact Native American habitation sites, concentrations of
                fire-altered rock and/or burned or charred organic materials, and historic structure
                remains such as stone-lined building foundations, wells or privy pits. Ground-
                disturbing project activities may continue in other areas that are outside the exclusion
                zone as defined below.

               An "exclusion zone" where unauthorized equipment and personnel are not permitted
                shall be established (e.g., taped off) around the discovery area plus a reasonable
                buffer zone by the Contractor Foreman or authorized representative, or party who
                made the discovery and initiated these protocols, or if on-site at the time or discovery,
                by the Monitoring Archaeologist (typically 25-50ft for single burial or archaeological
                find).
               The exclusion zone shall be secured (e.g., 24 hour surveillance) as directed by the
                City or County if considered prudent to avoid further disturbances.

               The Contractor Foreman or authorized representative, or party who made the
                discovery and initiated these protocols shall be responsible for immediately

                contacting by telephone the parties listed below to report the find and initiate the
                consultation process for treatment and disposition:

                        The City of Morgan Hill Community Development Director
                        The Contractor's Point(s) of Contact
                        The Coroner of the County of Santa Clara (if human remains found)
                        The Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) in Sacramento
                        The Amah Mutsun Tribal Band

               The Coroner has two working days to examine the remains after being notified of the
                discovery. If the remains are Native American the Coroner has 24 hours to notify the
                NAHC.

               The NAHC is responsible for identifying and immediately notifying the Most Likely
                Descendant (MLD) from the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band. (Note: NAHC policy holds
                that the Native American Monitor will not be designated the MLD.)

               Within 24 hours of their notification by the NAHC, the MLD will be granted
                permission to inspect the discovery site if they so choose.

               Within 24 hours of their notification by the NAHC, the MLD may recommend to the
                City's community development director the recommended means for treating or
                disposing, with appropriate dignity, the human remains and any associated grave
                goods. The recommendation may include the scientific removal and non-destructive
                or destructive analysis of human remains and items associated with Native American
                burials. Only those osteological analyses or DNA analyses recommended by the
                Amah Mutsun Tribal Band may be considered and carried out.

               If the MLD recommendation is rejected by the City of Morgan Hill the parties will
                attempt to mediate the disagreement with the NAHC. If mediation fails then the
                remains and all associated grave offerings shall be reburied with appropriate dignity
                on the property in a location not subject to further subsurface disturbance.

Implementation of these standard measures would ensure that development allowed under the
proposed General Plan amendment would not result in significant impacts to archaeological
resources.

4.5.3           Conclusion

Implementation of the standard measures and laws and regulations listed above, including the
Morgan Hill Municipal Code, would avoid possible impacts to buried archaeological resources from
future development on the site. (Less Than Significant Impact)

4.6              GEOLOGY AND SOILS

4.6.1            Setting

4.6.1.1          Soils

According to the City of Morgan Hill's Geology, Geologic, and Geological Hazards Study, soils on
the majority of the project site consist of unconsolidated colluvium, valley floor alluvium, or terrace
deposits on flat or nearly flat ground. Soils of this type may be subject to settlement under seismic or
aseismic conditions. Small portions of the northwestern and southern corners of the site contain soils
consisting of moderately to highly expansive alluvial or colluvial soil on flat or nearly flat ground.
Soils of this type may be subject to seasonal shrinking and swelling, soil creep, and settlement. Soils
on the western boundary of the site in the immediate vicinity of Fisher Creek are classified as
naturally infilled stream channels and fill placed without geotechnical control that occupy flat or
nearly flat ground. Soils of this type may be subject to vertical settlement. The entire site is
classified as valley floor terrain where ground water has been measured at least once, since about
1950, to be within 15 feet of the ground surface.

Most of soils on the site are described in Soils of Santa Clara County (1968) as Pleasanton loam.
Pleasanton loam has a moderate potential for expansion. Soils on the western boundary of the site, in
the immediate vicinity of Fisher Creek, are described as Los Osos clay loam (LoF). Los Osos clay
loam has a high potential for expansion. Expansive soils shrink and swell as a result of moisture
changes. These changes can cause heaving and cracking of slabs-on-grade, pavements and structures
found on shallow foundations. Because the site topography is flat, there is no erosion or landslide
hazard.

4.6.1.2          Seismicity

The San Francisco Bay Area is one of the most seismically active regions in the United States. An
earthquake of moderate to high magnitude generated within the San Francisco Bay region could
cause considerable ground shaking at the project site. The degree of shaking is dependent on the
magnitude of the event, the distance to its zone of rupture and local geologic conditions.

The three major faults in the region are the San Andreas Fault, the Calaveras Fault, and the Hayward
Fault. The San Andreas Fault runs north/south and parallel to the Hayward Fault and the Calaveras
Fault. The San Andreas Fault is approximately 10 miles west of the site, the Calaveras Fault is
approximately four miles east of the site, and the Hayward Fault is approximately 10 miles northeast
of the site. The project site is not located within a fault rupture zone. 3

                                                    Liquefaction

Soil liquefaction is a condition where saturated granular soils near the ground surface undergo a
substantial loss of strength during seismic events. Loose, water-saturated soils are transformed from
a solid to a liquid state during ground shaking. Liquefaction can result in significant deformations.
Soils most susceptible to liquefaction are loose, uniformly graded, saturated, fine-grained sands that
lie close to the ground surface. According to the City of Morgan Hill's Geology, Geologic, and
Geological Hazards Study, the entire site is classified as valley floor terrain where ground water has
been measured at least once, since about 1950, to be within 15 feet of the ground surface. Areas of
potential shallow groundwater are also areas of potential soil liquefaction. 4

4.6.2.1            Impacts from the Proposed Project

The project proponent proposes a General Plan amendment to change the land use designation on the
site from Public Facilities to Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre). This will allow
the future development of up to150 single-family units on the site. The project site is located in a
seismically active region and in an area with a potential for soil liquefaction. Soils with moderate to
high potential for expansion are also present on the site. Impacts to future development on the site
from geology soil conditions can be minimized through the use of standard engineering and seismic
safety design techniques. Future building design and construction would be completed in
conformance with a project-specific soil survey and geotechnical report, if warranted, and reviewed
by the City of Morgan Hill Building Division as a standard condition of development. The buildings
will be required to meet the requirements of appropriate Building and Fire Codes, as adopted by the
City of Morgan Hill.

Future development on the site will be required to prepare an Erosion Control Plan as a standard
condition prior to issuance of a building and/or site development permit, subject to review and
approval of the Public Works Department. Conformance with the measures in the erosion control
plan would reduce soil erosion during future construction.

4.6.2.2            Program Mitigation and Avoidance Measures

                                     City of Morgan Hill General Plan

Many of the policies in the City's General Plan were adopted for the purpose of avoiding or
mitigating environmental effects that could result from development planned within the City. All
future development is subject to General Plan policies, including the following, which will reduce or
avoid geologic and seismic impacts:

         Environmental Hazards Policy 1a  Limit uses on lands with geologic hazards.

         Environmental Hazards Policy 1c  Direct site preparation in hazardous areas at long-term
          geologic stability.

         Environmental Hazards Policy 1d  Known or potential geologic, fire, and flood hazards
          should be reported as part of every real estate transaction, as well as recordation on
          documents to be reported for building permits, subdivisions and land development reports.
          Mitigation of hazards should be noted in the same manner.

       Environmental Hazards Policy 1g  New development should avoid hazardous and sensitive
        areas, and should occur only where it can be built without risking health and safety. New
        habitable structures should not be allowed in areas of highest hazard such as floodways,
        active landslides, active fault traces, and airport safety zones. In areas of less risk,
        development should be limited and designed to reduce risks to an acceptable level. (SCJAP
        15.00)

       Environmental Hazards Policy 1k  Regulate development in hazardous areas in such a way
        that it minimizes disruption of the environment and does not trigger or accelerate the
        hazardous processes which exist in South County (SCJAP 15.02b)

       Environmental Hazards Policy 1n  Cluster development in hazardous areas with dwellings
        grouped on the least hazardous portion of the property. (SCJAP 15.02e)

       Environmental Hazards Actions 1.1  Continue to require geologic studies for development
        in hillside areas and geotechnical studies for critical facilities in areas with liquefiable soils.

       Environmental Hazards Action 2.7  Require geotechnical investigations on all projects in
        unstable areas, including areas of expansive soils, prior to construction to insure that the
        potential hazards are identified and can be properly mitigated. (SCJAP 15.13)

       Environmental Hazards Action 2.10 Contract with a consulting geologist for the review of
        development projects in potentially hazardous areas with costs covered by a fee to the
        developer (SCJAP 15.13b)

                               City of Morgan Hill Standard Measures

       Future building design and construction would be completed in conformance with a project-
        specific soil survey and geotechnical report, if warranted, and reviewed by the City of
        Morgan Hill Building Division as a standard condition of development. The buildings will
        be required to meet the requirements of appropriate Building and Fire codes, as adopted by
        the City of Morgan Hill.

       Future development on the site will be required to prepare an Erosion Control Plan as a
        standard condition prior to issuance of a building and/or site development permit, subject to
        review and approval of the Public Works Department. Conformance with the measures in
        the erosion control plan would reduce soil erosion during future construction.

4.6.3           Conclusion

Implementation of the General Plan policies and standard measures discussed above would avoid
geology and soil impacts at the time of future development on the site. (Less Than Significant
Impact)

4.7       HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

The following discussion is based upon a Phase I Site Assessment and a Soil Sampling and Analysis
Report prepared for the project site by E2C, Inc. in September 2000 and July 2001, respectively.

4.7.1           Setting

A review of available historical aerial photographs revealed that the site has been in agricultural
production since before at least 1950, and it has never been developed. This was confirmed in
conversations with the property owner who has personal knowledge of uses on the site for the 20
years prior to completion of the Phase I Site Assessment.

During the site reconnaissance, no evidence of existing underground or aboveground storage tanks
was observed on the site or on the accessible areas of the adjacent properties. The vegetation on the
site shows no obvious signs of abnormal biological stress, which can be an indicator of subsurface
contamination. No pits, ponds, or lagoons were observed on the site, nor were there any pools of
suspect liquids on the site. No discernible odors were noticed at the site. At the time of the site visit,
no Asbestos-Containing Building Materials (ACBMs) were observed on the site, including those that
might have been dumped there.

On the adjacent parcel to the north, a PG&E-owned pole-mounted transformer was observed
approximately 1,400 feet from the project site. On this same parcel, a large, abandoned, empty
metal container was observed. The soil and plants surrounding this container did not appear to be
stained, disturbed, or stressed. Union Pacific Railroad lines are located approximately 15 to 20 feet
east of the project site.

4.7.1.1         Field Investigation Results

Because the project site was in agricultural production before the use of DDT and certain other toxic
chemicals was banned in 1972, 15 areas of the site were sampled for hazardous materials. Samples
were collected from near surface sample locations. All samples were collected in glass jars and
transported to a state-certified laboratory to be analyzed for organochlorine and organohalide
pesticides (including DDD, DDT, and DDE), lead, and arsenic.

No pesticides or arsenic were detected in any of the samples collected on the project site. Only low
concentrations of lead, below the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandated Preliminary
Remediation Goals (PRGs), were detected.

4.7.1.2         Review of Agency Files

As part of the Phase I Site Assessment, a search of applicable regulatory databases was completed to
identify properties with documented environmental releases and/or those that use, store, or dispose of
regulated chemicals. The identification of contaminated or hazardous materials sites is important to
avoid potential land use compatibility and public safety impacts. The project site is not listed on any
of the databases searched as part of the Phase I report. One leaking underground storage tank was
documented on a site within one-half mile north of the project site. This site is a gas station located
at 19490 Monterey Road. A waste oil tank and surrounding soil was removed from that site and the
case has been closed. While the report describes that the aquifer was affected, the site is located
downgradient of the groundwater flow in the project area. Therefore, it is unlikely that this leak has
impacted the project site.

The "Geotracker" database, maintained by the State Water Resources Control Board, lists sites with
leaking underground tanks, underground tank wells, as well as some landfills. This database includes
approximately 115 sites in Morgan Hill, many of which are located in the downtown area along the
Monterey Road corridor. As of July 2009, the project site was not listed on local or state databases
[i.e., State Water Resources Control Board (Geotracker) or the Santa Clara County leaking
underground tank program] as a hazardous materials site where there is known contamination.

The project proponent proposes a General Plan amendment to change the land use designation on the
site from Public Facilities to Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre). This will allow
the future development of up to 150 single-family units on the site. As previously described, there is
no indication of past use of hazardous materials on the project site. Only low levels of lead were
found during sub-surface testing, which were well below the EPA mandated PRG values. Therefore,
excavation of soil on the site related to future residential development is not expected to result in
health risks to construction workers and/or the public.

The project site is located within one-half mile of a recorded hazardous materials site. While the
aquifer was affected by a leaking waste oil tank, the recorded site is located down-gradient from the
project site and the case has been closed. Therefore, it is not expected that the project site would be
affected by the waste oil leak.

Many of the policies in the City's General Plan were adopted for the purpose of avoiding or
mitigating environmental effects that could result from development planned within the City. All
future development is subject to General Plan policies, including the following, which will reduce or
avoid risk from exposure to soil contamination:

         Hazardous Materials Policy 3t  Provide mitigation to remedy the effects of new or
          expanding development over areas with environmental contamination of any and all
          unauthorized discharges.

4.8              HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

Portions of the following discussion are based in part upon a hydrology report completed for the
MHCHS FEIR in June 2001, by Schaaf & Wheeler, Consulting Civil Engineers, a memo dated
September 14, 2001 from Schaaf & Wheeler, Consulting Civil Engineers, and a drainage report
completed for the MHCHS FEIR in September 2001, by MH Engineering.

4.8.1            Setting

4.8.1.1          Drainage and Flooding

The project site is located in the Fisher Creek watershed. Runoff from the project site currently
drains into Fisher Creek, which runs along the western boundary of the project site, adjacent to Hale
Avenue. The site is relatively flat and slopes gently downward towards the creek and Hale Avenue.
In the vicinity of the project site Fisher Creek is a roadside drainage, ranging between five and eight
feet in width at the base and is about five feet deep. The project site is undeveloped, and, as a result,
the runoff rates from the site during storm events are low.

According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) 5, the flood designation for the majority of the project site is shown as Zone D, "areas of
undetermined, but possible, flood hazards". A portion of the property near the southern end of the
site is shown as Zone B, "areas between limits of the 100-year flood and 500-year flood; or certain
areas subject to 100-year flooding with average depths less than one (1) foot or where the
contributing drainage area is less than one square mile". 6

During a 100-year flood event, Fisher Creek receives floodwaters from four contributing areas, as
follows:

                overflows from West Little Llagas Creek,
                outflow from the Morgan Hill Business Park detention basin,
                outflow from the Sutter Business Park detention basin, and
                runoff from the upstream portion of the Fisher Creek watershed.

The existing creek does not have sufficient capacity to carry the 100-year peak discharge. During a
100-year flood event, both banks of the creek would be overtopped and the floodplain for the creek
would extend onto Hale Avenue to the west and onto the project site to the east.




5
  An updated FIRM for the project area went into effect on May 18, 2009 (Federal Emergency Management
Agency, Flood Insurance Rate Map, Community Panel Number 06085C 0443H). This FIRM does not include flood
zone designations on the project site, but does show designations in the immediate vicinity to the north, south, and
east. The area surrounding the site is designated as Zone X, which is defined as "Areas of 0.2% annual chance of
flood; areas of 1% annual chance of flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with drainage areas less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from 1% annual chance flood." It is likely that much of the project site
would be designated Zone X if the FIRM is updated to include the site. South of the site, the updated FIRM
designates areas in and around Hale Avenue as Zone AH, which is a 100-year flood zone with "Flood depths of 1 to
3 feet (usually areas of ponding); Base Flood Elevations determined." It is possible that this designation would
continue to the western border of the project site. Flood zone designations related to the portion of Fisher Creek
located adjacent to the project site are also not shown on this FIRM.

4.8.1.2          Dam Failure and Seiche

Dams located near Morgan Hill include Anderson Dam and Chesbro Dam. According to the
Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), almost all of the Valley Floor terrain in Morgan Hill
is within the area that would be inundated if these dams were to fail with reservoirs at full capacity. 7
The "worst case" flood of the entire valley is very unlikely, given that it would require both failure
and full capacity conditions to occur at the same time. The project site is located in the dam failure
inundation area of Anderson Dam. 8
A seiche is defined as a wave generated by rapid displacement of water within a reservoir or lake,
due to an earthquake that triggers land movement within the water body or landsliding into or
beneath the water body. The project site is not located near a water body that is susceptible to seiche
hazard.

4.8.1.3          Groundwater

The site is located within an area in the City of Morgan Hill with recorded groundwater levels of 15
feet or less. 9

4.8.1.4          Water Quality

The site is unpaved and undeveloped. The primary non-point source pollutants from the site would
be sediment and plant debris. Storm water runoff from the project site and surrounding area is
released into Fisher Creek. Fisher Creek is a tributary of Coyote Creek, which flows north and
eventually drains to the San Francisco Bay.

The water quality of ponds, creeks, streams, and other surface water-bodies can be greatly affected
by pollution carried in contaminated surface runoff. Pollutants from unidentified sources, known as
"non-point" source pollutants, are washed from streets, construction sites, parking lots, and other
exposed surfaces into storm drains. Stormwater runoff often contains contaminants such as oil and
grease, plant and animal debris (e.g., leaves, dust, animal feces, etc.) pesticides, litter, and heavy
metals. In sufficient concentration, these pollutants have been found to adversely affect the aquatic
habitats to which they drain.

                                           Regulatory Overview

The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) is responsible for implementation of the
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Program. The Central Coast RWQCB
issues and enforces NPDES permits for discharges to water-bodies in the portion of Santa Clara
County that drains to the Monterey Bay. Projects disturbing more than one acre of land during
construction are required to file a Notice of Intent (NOI) to be covered under the State NPDES
General Construction Permit for discharges of storm water associated with construction activities.

The State NPDES General Construction Permit requires development and implementation of a Storm
Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) and uses storm water Best Management Practices (BMPs)
to control runoff, erosion, and sedimentation from the site both during and after construction. The
7
  ABAG compiled the dam failure inundation hazard maps submitted to the State Office of Emergency Services by
dam owners throughout the Bay Area.

SWPPP has two major objectives: 1) to help identify the sources of sediments and other pollutants
that affect the quality of storm water discharges; and 2) to describe and ensure the implementation of
practices to reduce sediment and other pollutants in storm water discharges.

4.8.2.1         Impacts from the Proposed Project

The project proponent proposes a General Plan amendment to change the land use designation on the
site from Public Facilities to Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre). This will allow
the future development of up to150 single-family units on the site.

                                     Drainage and Flooding Impacts

Future development would add impervious surfaces to the currently undeveloped site, and thereby
increase stormwater runoff from the site. The existing creek channel does not have capacity to
convey the 100-year storm event. Future development on the site would exceed the existing drainage
capacity and increase the potential for flood-related property loss from a 100-year flood.

Impact HYD-1: Future development on the site would exceed the existing drainage capacity and
increase the potential for flood-related property loss from a 100-year flood. (Significant Impact)

                                            Water Quality Impacts

Future construction activities could increase the amount of pollution carried in runoff from the site.
Future development projects on the site will be required to prepare an Erosion Control Plan as a
standard condition prior to issuance of building and/or site development permit, subject to review and
approval of the Public Works Department. Conformance with the measures in the erosion control
plan would reduce the potential for substantial adverse impacts to water quality during construction.

In accordance with the City of Morgan Hill Standard Conditions of Approval and the General
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water Permit for Construction Activities,
future development projects would prepare a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) and
an Erosion Control Plan (ECP). The plans would be submitted to the Director of Public Works and
Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board for review and approval, prior to issuance of a
building permit. The ECP and SWPPP would demonstrate how the project would eliminate or
reduce non-stormwater discharges into the stormwater system, how discharges into the stormwater
system would be monitored, and what Best Management Practices (BMPs) would be implemented by

4.8.2.2           Program Mitigation and Avoidance Measures

                                   City of Morgan Hill General Plan

Many of the policies in the City's General Plan were adopted for the purpose of avoiding or
mitigating environmental effects that could result from development planned within the City. All
future development is subject to General Plan policies, including the following, which will reduce or
avoid hydrology and water quality impacts:

         Flood Control Policy 4a  Prepare for impacts associated with potential failure of Anderson
          Dam.

         Flood Control Policy 4b  Prohibit development in floodways and regulate in floodplains to
          minimize flood damage and be consistent with the federal flood insurance program and Santa
          Clara Valley Water District regulations. (SCJAP 15.05)

         Flood Control Policy 4e  Natural streamside and riparian areas should be left in their natural
          state in order to preserve their value as percolation and recharge areas, natural habitat, scenic
          resources, recreation corridors and for bank stabilization. (SCJAP 15.08)

         Flood Control Policy 4f  Minimize disruption of natural riparian areas by flood control
          projects needed to protect presently existing development by maintaining slow flow and
          stable banks through design and other appropriate mitigation measures. (SCJAP 15.08)

         Flood Control Policy 4h  Areas which are developed or planned for development should be
          protected by the construction of flood control facilities. Development should be managed
          through advanced planning and design standards to minimize off-site flooding and drainage
          problems. (SCJAP 12.00)

         Flood Control Policy 4k  Require developers whose proposed projects would induce
          downstream flooding to provide mitigation to eliminate the flood-inducing impacts of their
          projects. (SCJAP 12.03)

         Flood Control Policy 4l  If development is to be allowed in flood-prone areas, provide flood
          control facilities or appropriate flood-proofing prior to or in conjunction with development at
          developers' expense. (SCJAP 12.05)

         Flood Control Policy 4m  Where other mitigation measures do not solve the flooding
          problem, permit raising individual foundations (padding up structures) in appropriate
          situations; however, its use must be restricted in order to minimize the cumulative effects on
          adjacent areas. (SCJAP 12.06)

         Flood Control Policy 4n  Require mitigation of any storm water runoff produced by
          development that occurs beyond that described in the General Plans of the City and County
          as of 1982. (SCJAP 12.07)

       Flood Control Policy 4o  Require all local development to provide appropriate mitigation of
        off-site flooding impacts, including limiting runoff to pre-development levels and/or
        complete solutions to flooding and local drainage problems in the vicinity of the
        development, using such methods as detention or retention. (SCJAP 12.08)

       Flood Control Policy 4p  Require careful consideration of the cumulative effects of
        development which would drain into the upper reaches of Llagas Creek and other creeks, in
        order to avoid the need for channelization and consequent destruction of its riparian
        vegetation and natural habitat. (SCJAP 12.09)

       Water Quality Policy 5a  Protect water quality from contamination, and monitor it to assure
        the present policies and regulations are adequate. Prohibit such uses as waste facilities, septic
        systems, and industries using toxic chemicals where polluting substances may come in
        contact with groundwater, floodwaters, and creeks, or reservoir waters. (SCJAP 8.00)

       Water Quality Policy 6g  Encourage the protection, restoration, and enhancement of
        remaining native grasslands, oak woodlands, marshlands and riparian habitat.

                                City of Morgan Hill Municipal Code

In accordance with Morgan Hill Municipal Code Chapter 18.42, future construction on the site will
be required to comply with the City of Morgan Hill Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, including
elevation of habitable spaces above anticipated flood levels.

4.8.3           Conclusion

Implementation of the General Plan policies and standard measures discussed above would reduce or
avoid drainage and water quality impacts at the time of possible future development to a less than
significant level. (Less Than Significant Impact With Mitigation Incorporated)

4.9             LAND USE

4.9.1           Setting

The project site is currently used for agricultural purposes, and has been dry farmed as recently as
2001, although it has not been farmed in recent years. There are no structures on the project site.
Land uses surrounding the project site include residential, commercial, industrial, and open space.
Land uses east of the project site, beyond the railroad tracks and Monterey Highway, include
commercial land uses and industrial land uses. The areas north and south of the project site are
developed with single family residences. Rural land uses are located west of the project site, across
Hale Avenue. An aerial photograph of the project site with surrounding land uses is shown on Figure
3.

4.9.1.1         General Plan and Zoning

According to the City of Morgan Hill's General Plan Land Use Diagram, the General Plan land use
designation for the project site is Public Facilities. The project site is currently zoned Public
Facilities.

4.9.2.1         Impacts from the Proposed Project

The project proponent proposes a General Plan amendment to change the land use designation on the
site from Public Facilities to Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre). This will allow
the future development of up to 150 single-family units on the site.

The applicant has stated an objective to accommodate about 120 dwelling units on the site. Under
Morgan Hill's current general plan designations and zoning regulations, density is calculated based
on gross site area, and therefore the Single Family Medium designation and R1-7,000 zoning would
be the most appropriate categories to accommodate the applicant's project objectives.

                             Possible Changes to City of Morgan Hill
                          General Plan Designations and Zoning Districts

As previously discussed, the City of Morgan Hill has held public hearings and is preparing to adopt a
new "Single Family High (5-10 units/acre)" general plan land use designation and zoning, along with
changes to its definition of lot area to shift from "gross" to "net" as the basis of calculating density.
The new district would allow for lot sizes of less than 7,000 square feet, such as 5,000 and 6,000
square foot lots with detached single family units.

The Hale-Signature project site will need to accommodate the Madrone Parkway extension and
project roads, Fisher Creek and appropriate creek setbacks, on-site stormwater detention area, and
possible buffers from the UPRR and/or possible park area. It is possible changes to the definitions of
the lot sizes will be made to the zoning code in the near future and that the Hale-Signature project
could decide that the preferred method of achieving the project objectives under the City's new
regulations would be to instead apply the new Single Family High designation and zoning if it is
adopted and available as an option.

Throughout this Initial Study and in the Transportation Impact Analysis, the description will continue
to reflect the Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre) zoning district, but this will also be
interpreted to include designation as "Single Family High" if that option becomes available and the
applicant modifies the proposed project to that new designation as the preferred method of achieving
the assumed project housing type (about 5 units per gross acre or about 7 units per net acre) that is
analyzed by this Initial Study.

A comparison of the development standards under the existing Single-Family Medium Density (R1-
7000) zoning and the currently proposed Single-Family High Density (R1-4500) zoning is provided
in Table 4.9-1. The following discussion notes where development with smaller lots sizes envisioned
under Single Family High zoning could differ in land use characteristics or result in land use
conflicts.

                                            Land Use Conflicts

Land use conflicts can arise from two basic causes: 1) a new development or land use may cause
impacts to persons or the physical environment in the vicinity of the project site or elsewhere; or 2)
conditions on or near the project site may have impacts on persons or development introduced onto
the site by the project. Both of these circumstances are aspects of land use compatibility. Potential
incompatibility may arise from placing a particular development or land use at an inappropriate
location, or from some aspect of the project's design or scope. Depending on the nature of the


City of Morgan Hill                                                                              Initial Study
Hale-Signature                                        53                                         August 2009
impact and its severity, land use compatibility conflicts can range from minor irritations and nuisance
to potentially significant effects on human health and safety.

The proposed land use designation of Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per gross acre) is
compatible with the surrounding residential, rural, commercial, and industrial land uses. Residential
development on the site may, however, result in increased noise levels in the project area, and future
construction would also result in temporary noise impacts. Temporary air quality impacts may also
result during the construction of the project. Residential land uses are considered sensitive receptors.
Sections 4.11 Noise and 4.3 Air Quality, of this Initial Study, discuss these impacts in greater detail
and provide measures to reduce these impacts to a less than significant level.

Future residential development on the site would not physically divide an established community,
nor would it conflict with any applicable plans, policies, or regulations.

                 Possible Change to Single-Family High Designation and Zoning

While the Single-Family High Density zoning being considered by the City of Morgan Hill as a
separate project would allow smaller lot sizes, slightly smaller setbacks and taller maximum heights,
development under these standards would not result in substantially greater visual intrusion or other
land use compatibility impacts than development under the proposed Single-Family Medium Density
zoning (refer to Table 4.9-1). The proposed use (single family residential) would be compatible with
surrounding residential, rural, commercial, and industrial land uses whether at medium or high
density.

4.9.2.2         Impacts to the Proposed Project

Single family residences are considered sensitive receptors. The project site is located adjacent to
two major roadways (Hale Avenue and Monterey Road) and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks. The
existing Morgan Hill General Plan Circulation Element includes a future Madrone Parkway
extension improvement, which would be a four-lane arterial roadway that would include an at-grade
crossing over the UPRR tracks on the eastern edge of the site. The planned Madrone Parkway
extension identified in the city's Circulation Element will remain unchanged by the Hale-Signature
project application, but it should be recognized that the City of Morgan Hill is currently studying a
General Plan Circulation Element Amendment to modify the existing planned 4 lane arterial at-grade
crossing of the site, to be a 2 lane arterial grade-separated crossing. The General Plan Land Use
Amendment and rezoning of the site can accommodate either circulation network decision, i.e. to
keep the General Plan as it currently exists or to amend it with regard to the planned Madrone
Parkway extension improvement.

As a result of either version of the Madrone Parkway extension, noise levels at the project site can be
expected to be high. Section 4.11 Noise, of this Initial Study, discusses the noise impacts of the
roadways and railroad tracks in greater detail and provides measures to reduce these impacts to a less
than significant level.

4.9.2.3          Program Mitigation and Avoidance Measures

                                       Morgan Hill General Plan

Many of the policies in the City's General Plan were adopted for the purpose of avoiding or
mitigating environmental effects that could result from development planned within the City. All
future development is subject to General Plan policies, including the following, which will reduce or
avoid impacts:

         Incompatible Uses Policy 6a  Avoid development in areas of natural hazards such as
          landslide and flood prone areas.

         Incompatible Uses Policy 6b  Encourage the clustering of residential units to provide open
          space and recreation areas, and to provide buffer areas between different land uses (e.g.,
          industrial and residential).

         Incompatible Uses Policy 6c  Evaluate potential impacts of development projects on
          adjacent uses in initial environmental assessments and EIRs.

         Neighborhoods Policy 8a  Maintain distinct boundaries between commercial uses and
          residential neighborhood. (This does not preclude residential uses within commercial areas
          as part of mixed-use projects, or in designated mixed use areas.)

         Neighborhoods Policy 8e  Design residential neighborhoods so they are distinct and
          separated from conflicting non-residential uses.

         Edges Policy 15d  Feathering from higher urban densities to lower rural densities should
          occur within the city limits. Feathering should begin as development nears the Urban Limit
          Line.

                                Morgan Hill City Council Policy 05-02

In July 2005, the Morgan Hill City Council adopted an interim City Council policy that applies to
new development adjacent to streams and waterways:

         City Council Policy 05-02 - New development adjacent to streams and waterways shall be
          designed to preserve and integrate the waterways and associated habitats. New development
          should respect the water resource as an asset to the development, and shall not wall off the
          stream or waterway. New development shall incorporate open space buffers adjacent to
          waterways, in order to protect the stream and the existing/potential natural resources and
          habitats contained therein. Trails, pedestrian pathways and/or bikeways should be included
          within the open space buffer, either as reflected in the City's Park and Bikeways Master Plan
          or when reasonable and appropriate. Conditions of approval may be imposed to require
          restoration of riparian habitat, as feasible.

          This policy shall apply to land adjacent to streams and waterways which have value as
          natural and/or recreational resources, including Llagas, West Little Llagas, Edmundson,
          Fisher, Tennant, Corralitos and Coyote Creeks, as well as the Madrone and Butterfield
          Channels.

4.11            NOISE

The following discussion of noise is based in part upon a noise analysis conducted by Illingworth &
Rodkin Inc., in August, 2001 for the MHCHS FEIR, as well as an environmental noise assessment
prepared by Illingworth & Rodkin Inc., in February, 2008 for the East Central-Urban Housing Initial
Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (ECUH IS/MND).

4.11.1          Setting

4.11.1.1        Noise Background

Noise is defined as unwanted sound. Noise can be disturbing or annoying because of its pitch or
loudness. Pitch refers to relative frequency of vibrations, higher pitch signals sound louder to people.

A decibel (dB) is measured based on the relative amplitude of a sound. Ten on the decibel scale
marks the lowest sound level that a healthy, unimpaired human ear can detect. Sound levels in
decibels are calculated on a logarithmic basis such that each 10 decibel increase is perceived as a
doubling of loudness. The California A-weighted sound level, or dBA, gives greater weight to
sounds to which the human ear is most sensitive.

Sensitivity to noise increases during the evening and at night because excessive noise interferes with
the ability to sleep. Twenty-four hour descriptors have been developed that emphasize quiet-time
noise events. The Day/Night Average Sound Level, Ldn, is a measure of the cumulative noise
exposure in a community. It includes a 10 dB addition to noise levels from 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM to
account for human sensitivity to night noise.

4.11.1.2        Applicable Noise Standards

The City of Morgan Hill General Plan Acceptable Noise Levels standards state that the normally
acceptable interior noise level for residential uses is 45 dBA Ldn. General Plan Policy 7a states that
noise levels in new residential development exposed to an exterior Ldn of 60 dBA or greater should
be limited to maximum instantaneous noise levels (e.g., trucks on busy streets, train warning
whistles) in bedrooms of 50 dBA. Maximum instantaneous noise levels in all other habitable rooms
should not exceed 55 dBA. The maximum outdoor noise level for new residences near the railroad
shall be 70 dBA Ldn, recognizing that train noise is characterized by relatively few loud events. The
City's standards for acceptable exterior noise levels are 60 dBA Ldn in single-family residential use
areas and 70 dBA Ldn for playgrounds, neighborhood parks, agriculture and several types of outdoor
recreation. General Plan Policy 7a also states that where the City determines that providing an Ldn of
60 dBA or lower cannot be achieved after the application of reasonable and feasible mitigation, an
Ldn of 65 dBA may be permitted. In some cases, noise levels up to 75 dBA Ldn may be acceptable for
agriculture and outdoor recreation (such as golf courses and riding stables).

4.11.1.3        Existing Noise Environment

The project site is located at the urban edge of the City of Morgan Hill. The noise environment on
the site results primarily from vehicular traffic along Hale Avenue and Monterey Road, and railroad
activity on the tracks located on the eastern edge of the site. Based upon the future noise contour
map in the Morgan Hill General Plan, noise levels on most of the site in 2025 will be 70 dBA Ldn. A
small area in the northern portion of the site will be 65 dBA Ldn.



City of Morgan Hill                                                                         Initial Study
Hale-Signature                                    58                                        August 2009
Noise levels on the site were measured in 2001 for the MHCHS FEIR. Noise levels were monitored
over a 24-hour period at one location (LT-1) and in a 10-minute interval at another location (ST-1).
Refer to Figure 7 on the following page for the long- and short-term the noise measurement
locations.

The long-term measurement (LT-1) was taken approximately 309 feet from the center of Hale
Avenue and 510 feet from the center of Monterey Road, at the rear property line of residences on
Campoli Drive. The measured Ldn was 63 dBA. The predominant source of noise at this location
was vehicular traffic on both Hale Avenue and Monterey Road. This site was selected to quantify
the existing hourly distribution of noise levels at the property line of several residences south of the
project site. Noise generated by railroad activity also contributed to the measured noise levels.
Maximum noise levels ranged from 56 to 84 dBA. Hourly average noise levels (Leq) ranged from
about 43 to 63 dBA.

The short-term measurement (ST-1) was taken approximately 100 feet from the centerline of Hale
Avenue. The midday noise levels measured at this site was 55 dBA Leq.

Noise levels from railroad train operations were measured by Illingworth & Rodkin, Inc. in 1997
during preparation of the Lands of Madrone Ranch Noise Study for an adjacent development. Noise
levels were measured over a three-day period just south of Tilton Avenue at a distance of 75 feet
from the tracks. The daily average Ldn ranged from 72 dBA to 76 dBA over the three-day period.
The maximum noise levels generated by individual train passbys typically ranged from about 85 to
95 dBA. Occasionally, when trains sounded their warning horn immediately adjacent to the noise
monitoring station, the highest measured noise levels were 100 to 107 dBA. Trains typically sound
their warning horns within approximately one-quarter mile of at-grade railroad crossings. The
measured data described above are, therefore, applicable to the project site and represent what are
expected to be typical daily average and maximum noise levels resulting from railroad train activity.
The noise from the railroad trains would diminish at the rate of about six dBA with each doubling of
distance from the noise source, so a maximum noise level of 100 dBA measured at a distance of 75
feet from the railroad tracks would be reduced to about 80 dBA at a distance of 750 feet from the
railroad tracks.

In February 2008, an environmental noise assessment was prepared for the E. Central-Urban Housing
Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (ECUH IS/MND), which analyzed noise conditions on
a site located roughly 1.25 miles southeast of the project site. The ECUH IS/MND site is located
adjacent to the same UPRR tracks that border the eastern edge of the project site. Noise
measurements were taken at a location approximately 80 feet from the UPRR tracks at the terminus
of East Central Avenue. The estimated day-night average noise level at this location was measured
at 71 dBA Ldn, with maximum noise levels ranging from 85 to 95 dBA from train warning whistles.
On three occasions maximum noise levels ranged from 99 to 105 dBA. The relatively high
maximum noise levels were likely the result of a train sounding its whistle as it passed the site.
These noise levels correspond with those measured in 1997 at a similar distance from the UPRR
tracks.

4.11.1.4          Vibration Background

Ground vibration from passing trains consists of rapidly fluctuating motions or waves, which are also
measured in decibels. 10 The abbreviation "VdB" is used in this document for vibration decibels to

reduce confusion with sound decibels. Construction activities, train operations, and street traffic are
some of the most common external sources of vibration that can be perceptible inside residences.
Typical background vibration levels in residential areas are usually 50 VdB or lower, well below the
approximate 65 VdB threshold of perception for most people.

                                            Vibration Guidelines

Transit systems, including light and heavy rail, are potential sources of substantial ground vibration
depending on distance, the type and speed of trains, and the type of track. The Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) of the U.S Department of Transportation has developed vibration impact
assessment criteria for evaluating vibration impacts associated with transit projects.

According to the noise assessment prepared for the ECUH IS/MND, approximately 20 trains pass the
site on a daily basis. It is anticipated that rail traffic along the line will increase to 30 trains or more
per day with the planned Caltrain expansion project and other growth in rail service, but would not
exceed 70 trains per day. Train activity would be considered "occasional" with respect to the FTA
vibration impact criteria. For residences and buildings that experience "occasional events",
groundborne vibration of 75 VdB or less is acceptable.

4.11.1.5         Existing Vibration Environment

Railroad trains are a source of ground-borne vibration that could affect the project site. Vibration
measurements were made on February 5, 2008 for the ECUH IS/MND at two setback locations from
the UPRR tracks. The first measurements were taken approximately 80 feet from the railroad track
(V-1), and the second measurements were taken approximately 120 feet from the railroad track (V-
2). Vibration measurements were taken from each of the survey locations with two Caltrain trains
passing at approximately 30-35 mph. Location V-1 measured the passing trains at 76 VdB and 79
VdB, and Location V-2 measured the trains at 58 VdB and 61 VdB.

4.11.1.6         High-Speed Train

On November 4, 2008, California voters approved Proposition 1A, the "Safe, Reliable High-Speed
Passenger Train Bond Act", which will establish a high-speed train service linking Southern
California, the Sacramento San Joaquin Valley, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Among the
alignments being considered by the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA) for future high-
speed train routes is the existing UPRR alignment located adjacent to the project site. According to
the Draft Bay Area to Central Valley High-Speed Train (HST) Program EIR/EIS, 11 the proposed
high-speed train would use electrical power and operate in an exclusive right-of-way with no at-
grade crossings which would avoid the need to sound train horns during passbys near the project site.

According to the HST Program EIR/EIS, high-speed trains would travel at speeds of 125 miles per
hour or higher in the project area. The HST Program EIR/EIS indicates that noise levels from high-
speed trains traveling under 100 miles per hour would be comparable to the sounds of conventional
trains. At speeds above 150 miles per hour, high-speed train noise would increase over conventional
trains due to aerodynamic effects. Noise events from high-speed train passbys, however, would be
shorter in duration than noise events from conventional train passbys. Passbys of high-speed trains
would last a few seconds compared to 10-20 seconds for conventional passenger trains and over one
minute for freight trains. Groundborne vibration levels associated with high-speed train passbys are

relatively lower than conventional trains due to advanced track technology, smooth track and wheel
surfaces, and high maintenance standards required for high-speed operation. The HST Program
EIR/EIS concluded that the utilization of the existing UPRR alignment adjacent to the site for the
high-speed train route would result in "Medium" noise and vibration impacts.

4.11.2.1        Impacts to the Proposed Project

The project proponent proposes a General Plan amendment to change the land use designation on the
site from Public Facilities to Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre). This will allow
the future development of up to 150 single-family units on the site.

                                             Interior Noise

The State of California Building Code and the City of Morgan Hill require that interior noise levels
within new residential units not exceed 45 dBA Ldn. The necessary attenuation required for future
residential development to meet the 45 dBA Ldn interior noise standard would require the practical
application of best available noise control methods such as stucco sided, staggered stud walls, high
performance windows, and individual heating and cooling systems so that windows may be kept
closed to control noise. Large windows and doors also should be oriented away from the railroad
where possible.

                                        Exterior Noise Levels

General Plan Policy 7a allows a maximum outdoor noise level for new residences near the railroad of
70 dBA Ldn.. Based on noise levels measured by Illingworth & Rodkin, Inc. for the Lands of
Madrone Ranch Noise Study and the ECUH IS/MND, portions of the project site closest to the
railroad tracks will be exposed to noise levels above 70 dBA Ldn..

Impact NOI-1: Future development of single family residences on portions of the site closest to the
railroad tracks would expose future residents to noise levels in excess of the guidelines established
for residential use in the City of Morgan Hill's General Plan. (Significant Impact)

                                       Groundborne Vibration

Vibration measurements made for the ECUH IS/MND at two setback locations from the UPRR
tracks measured passing trains at 76 VdB and 79 VdB at a distance of 80 feet and 58 VdB and 61
VdB at a distance of 120 feet. Any future residences located within 80 feet of the UPRR tracks
would be exposed to groundborne vibration in excess of the FTA's acceptable level of 75 Vdb for
"occasional events".

Impact NOI-2: Future development of single family residences within 80 feet of the UPRR tracks
would expose future residents to excessive groundborne vibration. (Significant Impact)

4.11.2.2        Impacts from the Proposed Project

                                            Project Traffic

The proposed General Plan amendment to allow up to 150 single-family residences on the site would
generate a maximum of approximately 1,510 daily trips, with 115 trips during the AM peak hour and
151 trips during the PM peak hour. Based on the traffic volumes of roadways surrounding the site
and the expected distribution of project trips (refer to Appendix A), this level of additional traffic
would increase day/night average noise levels in the vicinity of the site by less than 1 dBA. This
level of increase would not be measurable or perceptible. The increased number of vehicle trips to
and from the project site would not result in a significant increase in noise levels in the project area.

                        Possible Future Short-Term Construction Impacts

Construction activities generate considerable amounts of noise. Future construction of single family
residences could result in short term noise impacts. Construction-related noise levels are normally
highest during the site preparation phase and during the construction of infrastructure. Typical
hourly average construction generated noise levels are about 81 dBA to 88 dBA measured at a
distance of 50 feet during busy construction periods (e.g., earth moving equipment etc.).

Construction-related noise levels are normally less during building erection, finishing, and
landscaping phases.

Impact NOI-3: Future construction of single family residences could result in short term noise
impacts. (Significant Impact)

4.11.2.3                Program Mitigation and Avoidance Measures

                                      Morgan Hill General Plan

Many of the policies in the City's General Plan were adopted for the purpose of avoiding or
mitigating environmental effects that could result from development planned within the City. All
future development is subject to General Plan policies, including the following, which will reduce or
avoid noise impacts:

       Noise Policy 7a  New development projects shall be designed and constructed to meet
        acceptable exterior noise level standards, as follows:

               The maximum exterior noise level of 60 dBA Ldn shall be applied in residential areas
                where outdoor use is a major consideration (e.g., backyards in single family housing
                developments and recreation areas in multi-family housing projects). Where the City
                determines that providing an Ldn of 60 dBA or lower cannot be achieved after the
                application of reasonable and feasible mitigation, an Ldn of 65 dBA may be
                permitted.
               Indoor noise levels should not exceed an Ldn of 45 dBA in new residential housing
                units.
               Noise levels in new residential development exposed to an exterior Ldn 60 dBA or
                greater should be limited to a maximum instantaneous noise level (e.g., trucks on
                busy streets, train warning whistles) in bedrooms of 50 dBA. Maximum
                instantaneous noise levels in all other habitable rooms should not exceed 55 dBA.
                The maximum outdoor noise level for new residences near the railroad shall be 70
                dBA Ldn, recognizing that train noise is characterized by relatively few loud events.

       Noise Policy 7b  The impact of a proposed development project on existing land uses should
        be evaluated in terms of the potential for adverse community response based on significant
        increase in existing noise levels, regardless of compatibility guidelines.

       Noise Policy 7e  Noise level increases resulting from traffic associated with new projects
        shall be considered significant if: a) the noise level increase is 5 dBA Ldn or greater, with a
        future noise level of less than 60 dBA Ldn, or b) the noise level increase is 3 dBA Ldn or
        greater, with a future noise level of 60 dBA Ldn or greater.

       Noise Policy 7g  Noise levels produced by other noise sources (such as ballfields) shall be
        considered significant if an acoustical study demonstrates they would substantially exceed
        ambient noise levels.

       Noise Policy 8a  Roadway design, traffic signalization and other traffic planning techniques
        (such as limiting truck traffic in residential areas) shall be used to reduce noise caused by
        speed or acceleration of vehicles.

        Noise Policy 8b  If noise barriers are deemed the only effective mitigation for development
         along major transportation corridors, an acoustical analysis shall be conducted to determine
         necessary dimensions.

4.11.2.4        Measures to be Considered at the Time of Future Development

The following standard measures applied to development projects in the City of Morgan Hill could
be employed at the time of future development:

                                             Interior Noise

        Prior to the issuance of building permits, a detailed acoustical analysis, in conformance with
         California Noise Insulation Standards in Title 24, Part 2 of the California Code of regulations
         (California Building Code), will be required for final design of the proposed single-family
         residential uses. The project will incorporate sound control treatments to meet an interior Ldn
         of 45 dBA (or 50 dBA as applicable) or less (with the windows closed) to the satisfaction of
         the City Building Official.

        Prior to the issuance of building permits, a detailed vibration analysis, in conformance with
         the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) vibration criteria and to the satisfaction of the City
         Building Official, could be required for final design of the proposed single-family residential
         uses. The project will not construct housing in areas that would be exposed to groundborne
         vibration in excess of FTA's acceptable level of 75 Vdb for "occasional events".

                                             Exterior Noise

        Prior to the issuance of building permits, a detailed acoustical analysis, will be required for
         final design of the proposed single-family residential development. The exterior open space
         areas shall be designed to meet an exterior Ldn 70 dBA or less, such mitigation measures may
         include: using the residential buildings to provide shielding for outdoor use areas including
         courtyards, rear yards, side yards, etc; constructing sound walls; and/or increased setback
         distances from the railroad. The final details for these measures will be determined during
         development of the final site plan, prior to issuance of building permits.

                                          Construction Noise

        Under the Morgan Hill Municipal Code, allowed hours of construction are limited to avoid
         substantial impacts to sensitive receptors, such as nearby residents, as follows:

               Construction activities shall be limited to the hours between 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM on
                weekdays and 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Saturdays. There shall be no construction
                activities on Sundays or federal holidays (Municipal Code Chapter 8.28.040)

4.11.3          Conclusion

Implementation of the General Plan policies, standard measures, and measures to be considered at
the time of future development discussed above would reduce or avoid noise impacts at the time of
possible future development to a less than significant level. (Less Than Significant Impact With
Mitigation Incoporated)

4.12               POPULATION AND HOUSING

4.12.1             Setting

According to California Department of Finance estimates, Morgan Hill's population for 2008 was
39,301 with 3.103 persons per households. 12 The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG)
projects the population for Morgan Hill to be 51,700 in 2030.13

As part of the General Plan, residential development within the City of Morgan Hill is controlled by
the Residential Development Control System (RDCS). By approving Measure C in 2004 and
Measure F in 2006, Morgan Hill voters extended the City's RDCS to 2020. RDCS establishes a
population ceiling for the City of 48,000 as of January 1, 2020.

Morgan Hill currently has a significant portion of its workforce traveling outside the City for
employment. Increasing jobs in the City would help to alleviate peak hour traffic by eliminating the
need for workers to commute from Morgan Hill to employment centers in northern Santa Clara
County.

The City's General Plan policies include maintaining a jobs housing balance (Jobs and Housing
Policy 2d). In 2005, the City had approximately 16,860 employed residents and 14,040 jobs or 0.83
jobs per employed resident.

4.12.2.1        Impacts from the Project

The project proponent proposes a General Plan amendment to change the land use designation on the
site from Public Facilities to Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre). This will allow
the future development of up to 150 single-family units on the site.

The proposed General Plan amendment would allow residential development on the parcel. A
maximum of 150 dwelling units could be constructed on the project site under the proposed land use.
While the General Plan amendment would facilitate residential growth in Morgan Hill, residential
growth in Morgan Hill is ultimately controlled by the Residential Development Control System
(RDCS). By approving Measure C in 2004, Morgan Hill voters extended the City's RDCS to 2020.
The General Plan assumes that some form of residential growth control and the current allowed rate
of 250 new units per year will continue until 2020, with the end result being a city population of
48,000. For this reason, population growth over the planning period will be consistent with the
assumptions in the City of Morgan Hill General Plan.

Subdivision to allow the construction of residences is not currently proposed by the project. A future
subdivision would be subject to the City's RDCS process.

4.12.3          Conclusion

Possible future residential development of up to 150 residences would not foster a substantial
increase in population in the City of Morgan Hill above projected population levels. (Less Than
Significant Impact)

4.13             PUBLIC SERVICES

4.13.1           Setting

4.13.1.1         Fire Service

The City of Morgan Hill contracts for fire and emergency medical services with the Santa Clara
County Fire Department. The City is served by the following two County fire stations: 1) El Toro
Fire Station, located at 18300 Old Monterey Road (approximately one mile southeast of the project
site), and 2) Dunne Hill Fire Station, located at 2100 East Dunne Avenue (approximately 4.5 miles
southeast of the project site). It is the Fire Department's goal to respond to calls within five and one-
half minutes. The City is also served under a mutual aid agreement by the California Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF). The CDF Station is located at 15670 South Monterey Road
(approximately three miles southeast of the project site).

4.13.1.2         Police Service

Police service is provided to the site by the City of Morgan Hill Police Department. The Morgan Hill
Police Facility is located at 16200 Vineyard Boulevard, just north of Tennant Avenue. The Police
Department's goal is to respond to Priority One calls within five minutes and Priority Two calls
within 10 minutes.

4.13.1.3         Schools

The project site is located within the Morgan Hill Unified School District. The District has nine
elementary schools, two middle schools, two comprehensive high schools, one continuation high
school, and a community adult school, as well as a home schooling program. The nearest schools to
the project site are Burnett Elementary (located approximately one mile northwest of the site),
Britton Middle School (located approximately 1.5 miles southeast of the site), and Sobrato High
School (located approximately one mile north of the site).

4.13.1.4         Parks

The City of Morgan Hill currently owns approximately 150 acres of parks and recreational facilities
including two community parks, two neighborhood parks, two neighborhood/school parks, and 14
mini-parks.

In addition to parks, the City owns special use recreational facilities. These facilities include the
Morgan Hill Aquatics Center, Centennial Recreation Center, Community and Cultural Center, and
Outdoor Sports Center. School facilities are also available for use after school hours and on
weekends.

Based on the current Draft Capital Improvements Program (CIP), the City will purchase 40 acres of
parkland in summer 2009 and the City will own a total of approximately 213 acres of parkland by the
end of 2011 to serve an estimated population of 41,391. 14 This exceeds the City's goal of five acres
of parkland per 1,000 capita.

Morgan Hill residents also utilize county and state parks. The closest facilities to the City are the
Anderson Reservoir to the east, the Coyote Creek park chain to the north, and Henry Coe State Park
to the east.

The City is also in the process of developing a Trails Master Plan, which is currently undergoing
CEQA environmental review. The Master Plan is intended to provide long-term direction for
guiding future trail development given the projected continued growth of Morgan Hill and the region.
The Master Plan is intended to be a flexible, comprehensive, and long-range planning document for
the acquisition of properties for a future citywide trails system. It is also intended to build upon the
Morgan Hill Bicycle Plan by identifying additional linkages, pathways, and commute routes for both
pedestrian and bicyclists, while acknowledging the surrounding natural environment. The Master
Plan proposes open space trails for the undeveloped hillsides in and around Morgan Hill, providing
access to open grassy ridges with panoramic views. These open space trails will also provide access
from Morgan Hill to nearby parks and existing trail connections.

4.13.2.1        Fire and Police Service

Future residences would be constructed in conformance with current building and fire codes,
including features that would reduce potential fire hazards. Future project designs would be
reviewed by both the Santa Clara County Fire Department and the Morgan Hill Police Department to
ensure that it incorporates appropriate safety features to reduce fire hazards and criminal activity.

Future residential development on the site would be unlikely to substantially increase the demand for
fire and police protection, or require construction or expansion of fire or police facilities.



City of Morgan Hill                                                                                          Initial Study

4.13.2.2        Schools

Future residential development on the site would increase the population of the project area and,
therefore, would increase demand on local schools. Using the Morgan Hill Unified School District's
student generation rate of 0.72 students per new housing unit, the future development could generate
up to approximately 108 new students at full buildout. Prior to future development, the Morgan Hill
School District would review the proposed projects during the RDCS process and, at that time,
determine if existing school facilities are adequate to serve the proposed projects.

State Law (Government Code Section 65996) specifies an acceptable method of offsetting a project's
effect on the adequacy of school facilities is payment of a school impact fee prior to issuance of a
building permit. The school impact fees implementation of measures specified in Government Code
65996 would be used to offset project-related increase in student enrollment. Future development
projects would be required to comply with the school impact fee requirements of the Morgan Hill
Unified School District.

4.13.2.3        Parks

The proposed General Plan amendment would generate additional residents in the City of Morgan
Hill. In providing a private park/open space for future residents, a future development could lessen
the project's impact on public park facilities. However, the development of private parkland, does
not satisfy the City's goal of providing public parkland.

The City of Morgan Hill has adopted a parkland dedication/park land in-lieu fee ordinance
(Municipal Code Chapter 17.28) that requires parkland dedication or in-lieu fees for residential
developments. This ordinance requires residential developers to dedicate public parkland or pay in-
lieu fees, or both, to offset the demand for neighborhood parkland created by their housing
developments. The acreage of parkland or amount of the in-lieu fee required is based upon criteria
outlined in Chapter 17.28 of the City's Municipal Code. Future projects will be required to comply
with the City's parkland dedication or in-lieu fees for residential developments, which will avoid
significant impacts to the City's park facilities.

4.13.2.4                Program Mitigation and Avoidance Measures

                                     Morgan Hill General Plan

Many of the policies in the City's General Plan were adopted for the purpose of avoiding or
mitigating environmental effects that could result from development planned within the City. All
future development is subject to General Plan policies, including the following, which will reduce or
avoid public services impacts:

       Services Policy 16a  Maintain high standards of siting and design in the development of
        City facilities (e.g., parks, City offices, fire stations).

       Services Policy 16c  Identify public facility and service needs, and coordinate their
        development to minimize costs and support achievement of community goals. (SCJAP 5.00)

       Public Safety Policy 17a  Ensure police and fire staffing and facilities as necessary to
        provide adequate public safety protection.

        Public Safety Policy 17b  Promote police and fire security considerations in all structures by
         ensuring that crime and fire prevention concepts are considered in development and design.

        Parks and Recreation Policy 18a  Recreational facilities and programs shall meet the needs
         of all Morgan Hill residents, including seniors, youth, and citizens with disabilities.

        Parks and Recreation Policy 18h  Parks and recreational facilities shall be designed to
         primarily meet community needs. Regional need may be a consideration in the planning and
         design of recreation facilities if there are long-term operations and maintenance benefits
         (such as facilities where regional tournaments may help off-set long-term operations costs)
         and/or meet other General Plan goals (such as economic development). Facilities that may
         meet regional needs shall be located and designed in such a way to minimize impact on
         residential neighborhoods.

        Parks and Recreation Policy 18i  Incorporate emergency services (fire and police) into the
         design review process for new parks, recreation facilities, and trails.

                            Standard Measures (Laws and Regulations)

Future residences would be constructed in conformance with current building and fire codes,
including features that would reduce potential fire hazards. Future project designs would be
reviewed by both the Santa Clara County Fire Department and the Morgan Hill Police Department to
ensure that it incorporates appropriate safety features to reduce fire hazards and criminal activity.

State Law (Government Code Section 65996) specifies an acceptable method of offsetting a project's

projects would be required to comply with the school impact fee requirements of the Morgan Hill
Unified School District.

The City of Morgan Hill has adopted a parkland dedication/park land in-lieu fee ordinance
(Municipal Code Chapter 17.28) that requires parkland dedication or in-lieu fees for residential
developments. This ordinance requires residential developers to dedicate public parkland or pay in-
lieu fees, or both, to offset the demand for neighborhood parkland created by their housing
developments. The acreage of parkland or amount of the in-lieu fee required is based upon criteria
outlined in Chapter 17.28 of the City's Municipal Code. Future projects will be required to comply
with the City's parkland dedication or in-lieu fees for residential developments, which will avoid
significant impacts to the City's park facilities.

4.13.3          Conclusion

Implementation of the General Plan policies and standard measures discussed above would reduce or
avoid public services impacts at the time of possible future development to a less than significant
level. (Less Than Significant Impact)

4.14                RECREATION

4.14.1              Setting

The City's General Plan has a parks and recreation goal to provide useful, accessible and high-
quality park, recreation and trail facilities and programs. Morgan Hill's General Plan goal for
parkland is five acres per 1,000 residents; however, in accordance with State laws regarding the level
of impact fees and maximum requirements for subdivisions, the Municipal Code requires three acres
of parkland per 1,000 residents. Efforts to achieve greater than 3.0 acres per 1,000 residents are
made through other means such as voluntary commitments, state grants, school parks, etc.

The City of Morgan Hill currently owns approximately 150 acres of public parkland, including
various park facilities (e.g., community parks, neighborhood parks, mini-parks, shared-school fields,
creek trail, and demonstration garden) and recreational facilities (e.g., Aquatics Center, Centennial
Recreation Center, and Outdoor Sports Center). Not included in this total are school facilities solely
owned by the School District. These facilities are typically available after hours and on weekends
and include 12 baseball/softball fields, nine soccer fields, two football fields, two tracks, and four
swimming pools.

Based on the current Draft Capital Improvements Program (CIP), the City will purchase 40 acres of
parkland in summer 2009 and the City will own a total of approximately 213 acres of parkland by the
end of 2011 to serve an estimated population of 41,391. 15 This exceeds the City's goal of five acres
of parkland per 1,000 capita.

4.14.2.1        Impacts from the Project

The project proponent proposes a General Plan amendment to change the land use designation on the
site from Public Facilities to Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre). This will allow
the future development of up to 150 single-family units on the site.

Based on the average number of three persons per household, future residential development on the
site could generate up to 450 residents. Using the City's parkland goal of five acres per 1,000
residents, the future residential development projects would need to provide 2.25 acres of public
parkland.

The City of Morgan Hill has adopted a parkland dedication/park land in-lieu fee ordinance
(Municipal Code Chapter 17.28) that requires parkland dedication or payment of in-lieu fees to
reduce the impact of residential developments on the City's public park system. The acreage of
parkland or amount of the in-lieu fee required is outlined in Chapter 17.28 of the City's Municipal
Code. Future residential development projects would be required to comply with the City's parkland
dedication/park land in-lieu fee ordinance. For this reason, the proposed project General Plan
amendment would not significantly impact parks or recreational facilities in the project area.

4.14.2.2        Program Mitigation and Avoidance Measures

                                    Morgan Hill General Plan

Many of the policies in the City's General Plan were adopted for the purpose of avoiding or
mitigating environmental effects that could result from development planned within the City. All
future development is subject to General Plan policies, including the following, which will reduce or
avoid recreation impacts:

       Services Policy 16a  Maintain high standards of siting and design in the development of
        City facilities (e.g., parks, City offices, fire stations).

       Services Policy 16c  Identify public facility and service needs, and coordinate their
        development to minimize costs and support achievement of community goals. (SCJAP 5.00)

       Parks and Recreation Policy 18a  Recreational facilities and programs shall meet the needs
        of all Morgan Hill residents, including seniors, youth, and citizens with disabilities.

       Parks and Recreation Policy 18h  Parks and recreational facilities shall be designed to
        primarily meet community needs. Regional need may be a consideration in the planning and
        design of recreation facilities if there are long-term operations and maintenance benefits
        (such as facilities where regional tournaments may help off-set long-term operations costs)
        and/or meet other General Plan goals (such as economic development). Facilities that may
        meet regional needs shall be located and designed in such a way to minimize impact on
        residential neighborhoods.

       Parks and Recreation Policy 18i  Incorporate emergency services (fire and police) into the
        design review process for new parks, recreation facilities, and trails.

                           Standard Measures (Laws and Regulations)

The City of Morgan Hill has adopted a parkland dedication/park land in-lieu fee ordinance
(Municipal Code Chapter 17.28) that requires parkland dedication or in-lieu fees for residential
developments. This ordinance requires residential developers to dedicate public parkland or pay in-
lieu fees, or both, to offset the demand for neighborhood parkland created by their housing
developments. The acreage of parkland or amount of the in-lieu fee required is based upon criteria
outlined in Chapter 17.28 of the City's Municipal Code. Future projects will be required to comply
with the City's parkland dedication or in-lieu fees for residential developments, which will avoid
significant impacts to the City's park facilities.

4.15            TRANSPORTATION

The following discussion is based upon a Transportation Impact Analysis prepared by Fehr and Peers
in June 2009. A copy of the analysis is provided in Appendix A of this Initial Study.

4.15.1          Setting

4.15.1.1        Regional and Local Roadway Access

The regional and local roadway network providing access to the site is described below and shown in
Figure 8. The eight study intersection locations are also shown on Figure 8 and discussed in Section
4.15.1.6.

US 101 is a north-south freeway that serves as the primary connection between Morgan Hill and all
other areas of Santa Clara County. US 101 extends north to San Francisco and south to Los Angeles.
The freeway has six lanes (three mixed-flow lanes in each direction) within Morgan Hill. North of
Cochrane Road, US 101 widens to eight lanes including three mixed-flow lanes and one high
occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction. HOV lanes, also known as diamond or carpool
lanes, restrict use to vehicles with two or more persons (carpool, vanpool, and buses) or motorcycles
during the morning (5:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and evening (3:00 PM to 7:00 PM) commute periods.
The Cochrane Road interchange provides primary access to the project site.

Monterey Road, through Morgan Hill, is generally a four-lane arterial roadway with separate left-turn
lanes at intersections and on-street parking in some areas. Monterey Road extends from San Jose
through the downtown area of Morgan Hill to the City of Gilroy. The speed limit on Monterey Road
varies from 45 miles per hour (mph) north of Cochrane Road to 25 mph between Main Avenue and
East Dunne Avenue in downtown. Several sets of speed lumps slow traffic through the downtown
area.

Cochrane Road is an arterial roadway that extends from Monterey Road east to Anderson Lake.
Cochrane Road is a two to six-lane facility that provides an interchange with US 101 at the north end
of the city. The posted speed limit is 45 mph.

Madrone Parkway is a two-lane undivided collector that extends eastward from its intersection with
Monterey Road and connects with Cochrane Road. The roadway is posted at 35 mph. Per the City's
July 2001 General Plan, Madrone Parkway will be extended westward to provide a connection
between Monterey Road and Hale Avenue. This extension is assumed in the 2030 roadway network.

Hale Avenue is generally a two-lane arterial extending north from its terminus at Main Avenue
towards San Jos, where it becomes Santa Teresa Boulevard. Near the project site, Hale Avenue
serves as a north-south commute corridor.

Llagas Road is a collector that extends eastward from the City's western city limits to Old Monterey
Road. The posted speed limit is 25 mph. Between Old Monterey Road and Llagas Creek Drive, the
roadway is a two-lane road that provides left-turn lanes into the intersecting local streets. West of
Llagas Creek Drive, Llagas Road is a two-lane facility.

Tilton Avenue is two-lane collector road that provides a connection between Hale Avenue and
Monterey Road. The posted speed limit is 35 mph.

4.15.1.2        Existing Transit Service

Bus service in Santa Clara County is operated by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA). Commuter rail service (Caltrain) is provided from San Francisco to Gilroy by the Peninsula
Joint Powers Authority Board. Existing bus routes and Caltrain service are described below and
shown graphically on Figure 9.

                                           VTA Bus Routes

Route 16, a local community bus, provides service between the Morgan Hill Civic Center and
Burnett Avenue. Service operates every 60 minutes from 6:30 AM to 6:00 PM on weekdays only.

Route 68, a regional bus route, provides service between the City of Gilroy Caltrain/Greyhound
Station and the San Jose Diridon Caltrain Station. Service operates on weekdays every 30 minutes
from 4:15 AM to 1:20 AM and on weekends every 30 minutes from 5:45 AM to 1:20 AM.

                                           Caltrain Service

Caltrain provides frequent daily train service between San Jose and San Francisco. Service extends
south to Gilroy through Morgan Hill during commute periods, with three northbound trips during the
AM peak period and three southbound trips during the PM peak period stopping at the Morgan Hill
Caltrain Station. The Morgan Hill Caltrain Station is located east of Depot Street between First and
Second Streets, approximately two miles southeast of the project site.

4.15.1.3        Existing Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities

Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian signals, and off-street paths that are
meant to provide safe and convenient routes for pedestrians to access destinations such as
institutions, businesses, public transportation, and recreation facilities. Crosswalks are not provided
on Tilton Avenue/Hale Avenue and Monterey Road/Tilton Avenue. Other study intersections
provide limited crosswalks in each direction to bring continuity with adjacent sidewalks. Sidewalk
facilities are provided on the following roadway segments within the vicinity of the project.

       Eastside of Hale Avenue between Tilton Avenue and northern end of the project site;
       Llagas Road between Hale Avenue and Old Monterey Avenue;
       Westside of Old Monterey Avenue between Llagas Road and Monterey Road;
       Eastside of Monterey Road between Cochrane Road and Old Monterey Road;
       Discontinuous segments along Monterey Road between Tilton Avenue and Cochrane Road.

Bicycle facilities comprise paths (Class I), lanes (Class II), and routes (Class III). Bicycle paths are
paved trails that are separate from roadways. Bicycle lanes are lanes on roadways designated for
bicycle use by striping, pavement legends, and signs. Bicycle routes are roadways designated for
bicycle use by signs only.

No Class I bike paths exist in the project vicinity. Class II bike lanes are located along the following
roadways in the study area:

       Monterey Road north of Cochrane Road;
       Monterey Road south of Old Monterey Road;
       Cochrane Road between Monterey Road and Sutter Boulevard;

4.15.1.4           Intersection Level of Service Methodology

The operations of roadway facilities are described in terms of level of service (LOS). LOS is a
qualitative description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom
to maneuver. Six levels are defined from LOS A, with the best operating conditions, to LOS F, with
the worst operating conditions. LOS E represents "at-capacity" operations. Operations are
designated as LOS F when volumes exceed capacity, resulting in stop-and-go conditions.

The level of service method for signalized intersections approved by the City of Morgan Hill and
VTA analyzes intersection operations based on average control vehicular delay, as described in
Chapter 16 of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) by the Transportation Research Board,
with adjusted saturation flow rates to reflect conditions in Santa Clara County. Control delay
includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay.
The average control delay for signalized intersections is calculated using TRAFFIX analysis software
and is correlated to a LOS designation as shown in Table 4.15-1.

                                             Table 4.15-1:

Operations of the unsignalized study intersections are evaluated using the method contained in
Chapter 17 of the 2000 HCM and calculated using TRAFFIX analysis software. LOS ratings for
stop-sign controlled intersections are based on the average control delay expressed in seconds per
vehicle. At two-way or side-street-stop controlled intersections, control delay is calculated for each
movement, not for the intersection as a whole. For approaches composed of a single lane, delay is
computed as the average of all movements in that lane. For all-way stop-controlled locations, a
weighted average delay for the entire intersection is presented. Table 4.15-2 summarizes the
relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections.

The City of Morgan Hill has established a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D+ for
signalized intersections and LOS D for unsignalized intersections. Per the City of Morgan Hill
General Plan, the Madrone Parkway/Monterey Road study intersection is one of three signalized
intersections in the City that are allowed to operate at LOS D.

4.15.1.5        Freeway Segment Level of Service Methodology

Freeway segments are evaluated using VTA's analysis procedure, which is based on the density of
the traffic flow using methods described in the 2000 HCM. Density is expressed in passenger cars
per mile per lane. The Congestion Management Program range of densities for freeway segment
level of service is shown in Table 4.15-3. The LOS standard for the freeway segments is LOS E.

4.15.2.1           Thresholds of Significance

                                               Signalized Intersections

For the purposes of this analysis, a significant traffic impact at a signalized intersection would occur
if the addition of project traffic causes:

          Intersection operations to deteriorate from an acceptable level (LOS D+ or better for most
           intersections and LOS D or better for the Madrone Parkway/Monterey Road intersection)
           under the Existing Conditions to an unacceptable level ( LOS D or worse for most
           intersections and LOS D- or worse for the Madrone Parkway/Monterey Road intersection);
           or,
          Exacerbation of unacceptable operations under Existing Conditions by increasing the average
           critical delay by more than 4 seconds and increasing the critical volume-to-capacity (V/C)
           ratio by 0.01 or more at an intersection operating at LOS E or LOS F under 2030 General
           Plan Baseline with Project Conditions.
None of the intersections analyzed for this report are designated Congestion Management Program
(CMP) intersections.

                                           Unsignalized Intersections

Level of service analysis at unsignalized intersections is generally used to determine the need for
modification in type of intersection control (i.e. all-way stop or signalization). As part of this
evaluation traffic volumes, delay, and traffic signal warrants are evaluated to determine if the
existing intersection control is appropriate.

The City has generally used a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D for unsignalized
intersections. In accordance with the City's adopted thresholds of significance (in its May 2008
Guidelines for Preparing Transportation Impact Reports), significant impacts are defined to occur
when the addition of project traffic causes the worst movement/approach to degrade to LOS E or
LOS F and the intersection satisfies the peak hour signal warrants from the MUTCD.

                                         Freeway Segments

According to VTA's Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines, a freeway segment analysis should
be included if the project meets one of the following requirements:

       The proposed development project is expected to add traffic equal to at least one percent of a
        freeway segment's capacity.

       The proposed development project is adjacent to one of the freeway segment's access or
        egress points

       Based on engineering judgment, Lead Agency staff determines that the freeway segment
        should be included in the analysis.

According to CMP guidelines, freeway segments with project traffic equal to or greater than one
percent of the freeway segment's capacity must be evaluated. For mixed-flow lanes, freeway
segment capacities are defined as 2,200 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for four-lane freeway
segments and 2,300 vphpl for six-lane freeway segments. HOV lane capacities are defined between
1,800 to 1,900 vphpl.

If a project meets the criteria outlined above, then the implementation of the proposed project could
result in a significant impact if the addition of project traffic on a freeway segment exceeded one of
the following thresholds:

       The addition of project traffic causes the operating level of a freeway segment to deteriorate
        from LOS E or better under Existing Conditions to LOS F; or

       The number of new trips added by a proposed project to a segment already operating at LOS
        F under Existing Conditions is more than one percent of the freeway segment capacity.

4.15.2.2        2030 General Plan Conditions

This discussion describes the expected traffic operations under 2030 General Plan Conditions with
and without the proposed GPA. The City of Morgan Hill travel demand forecasting model was used
to estimate 2030 traffic volumes. 2030 land use and network assumptions are briefly discussed
below and followed by a more detailed discussion of intersection operations.

                       Land Use and Transportation Network Assumptions

The City's travel demand forecasting model was used to develop 2030 General Plan traffic volume
estimates. 2030 land use estimates were based on input from City staff and regionally approved data
from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). Under 2030 General Plan Baseline
Conditions the model includes agricultural land uses for the project site. To present a more
conservative approach, project trips associated with the GPA were added to the 2030 General Plan
Baseline volumes and no trip credits were taken for the agricultural uses modeled for the site.
Included in the model is the planned roadway network based on the 2001 General Plan Circulation
Element. Planned roadway network improvements relevant to the project include:

       Construction of the Madrone Parkway as a four lane roadway extension between Monterey
        Road and Hale Avenue bisecting the project property;

         Construction of the Llagas Creek Drive as a two lane collector between Hale Avenue and
          Monterey Road;
         Widening of Hale Avenue from two to four lanes from Tilton Avenue to Main Street;
         Widening of Monterey Road from four to six lanes north of Cochrane Road;
         Widening of Monterey Road from two to four lanes south of Cochrane Road; and
         Widening of Cochrane Road from four to six lanes east of Monterey Road.

                  2030 General Plan Baseline with Project Traffic Volume Estimates

The amount of traffic associated with the project was estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip
generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip assignment. In the first step, the amount of traffic
entering and exiting the project area was estimated on a daily and peak-hour basis. In the second
step, the direction vehicles use to approach and depart the site was estimated. The trips were
assigned to specific street segments and intersection turning movements in the third step and added to
the 2030 General Plan Baseline traffic volumes to develop 2030 General Plan Baseline with Project
traffic volumes. The results of the process for this analysis are described in the following sections.

Trip Generation

The proposed GPA allows for the development of up to 150 single family homes on the 30-acre
project site. Trip generation was calculated using rates from the Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE) Trip Generation (8th Edition). The peak-hour trip generation trip estimates for each phase are
presented in Table 4.15-6. A 150 single family home development is estimated to generate 1,510
daily trips, 115 AM peak-hour trips (29 inbound and 86 outbound), and 151 PM peak-hour trips (95
inbound and 56 outbound).

Trip Distribution

Project trip distribution was primarily based on a select zone analysis using the City's travel demand
forecasting model. Location of supporting land uses in the vicinity of the project area, information
from previous traffic studies in the area, and input from City staff was used to refine the trip
distribution. Approximately 40 percent of trips are expected to travel north of the City of Morgan
Hill and 25 percent to destinations south of the City. The remaining trips are spread to destinations
within the City of Morgan Hill.

     Trip Assignment

     Trips generated by the proposed project were assigned to the roadway system based on the directions
     of approach and departure described above. Project-generated trips were added to the 2030 General
     Plan Baseline volumes to estimate volumes under 2030 General Plan Baseline with Project
     Conditions.

                                   2030 General Plan Intersection Level of Service

     Existing intersection configurations were modified to accommodate the proposed Madrone Parkway
     extension crossing between Monterey Road and Hale Avenue and widened roadways (e.g. Monterey
     Road widened from two to four lanes south of Cochrane Road and Hale Avenue widened from two to
     four lanes between Tilton Avenue and Main Street).

     2030 General Plan roadway intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak-hour turning
     movement volumes were used as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of the LOS analysis
     for 2030 General Plan with Project Conditions are presented in Table 4.15-7, below. Measured
     against the City's current LOS D+ standard for signalized intersections (LOS D is acceptable for the
     Madrone Parkway/Monterey Road intersection) and LOS D standard for unsignalized intersections,
     all of the study intersection would operate at acceptable levels.

                                  2030 General Plan Signal Warrant Analysis

     The unsignalized Hilton Avenue/Tilton Avenue intersection is projected to operate at acceptable
     levels in 2030, and no signal warrant analysis was performed.

                                2030 General Plan Freeway Segment Analysis

     According to CMP guidelines, freeway segments to which a proposed development is projected to
     add trips equal to or greater than one percent of the freeway segment's capacity must be evaluated.
     The freeway segments immediately north and south of Cochrane Road were reviewed to determine if
     a significant amount of project traffic would be added to these freeway segments. Capacities of
     2,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for freeway segments with three or more lanes and
     capacities of 2,200 vphpl for freeway segments with two lanes were used in the freeway analysis. To
     be conservative, no project trips were assigned to HOV lanes.

     Table 4.15-8, below, outlines the estimated number of net new trips added to the freeway segments
     under 2030 General Plan with Project Conditions. The proposed project would not add new trips
     greater than one percent of the freeway segment capacity to any of the study freeway segments.
     Therefore, no additional freeway segment analysis is required for the proposed project and the
     project would not result in a significant impact to freeways.

                                    Pedestrian, Bicycle, and Transit Impacts

     The City's Guidelines for Preparation of Transportation Impact Reports does not specify impact
     criteria for pedestrian, bicycle, and transit impacts. However, these impacts are generally evaluated
     based on whether a proposed project would: 1) conflict with existing or planned pedestrian, bicycle,
     or transit facilities, or 2) create walking, bicycling, or transit use demand without providing adequate
     and appropriate facilities for non-motorized mobility.

The proposed project is not expected to increase the biking, or transit demand to a level where it
could not be accommodated by existing or planned facilities. To accommodate pedestrian travel,
development of the project site should include the construction of sidewalks on Hale Avenue along
the project frontage. On the east side of the project site, the existing rail road tracks provide a barrier
to Monterey Road. Under a porposed General Plan Circulation Element Amendment now under
study by the City of Morgan Hill, the construction of the Madrone Parkway extension would change
to a two-lane roadway and include an underpass at Monterey Road and the railroad tracks. This grade
separation project should provide adequate pedestrian and bicycle access to facilitate connectivity
between the proposed and existing residential developments west of Monterey Road and the land
uses to the east. With the provision of sidewalks on Hale Avenue along the project frontage at the
time of future development, the proposed implementation of the General Plan amendment would
have a less than significant impact on pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities and services.

4.15.2.3          2030 General Plan Cumulative Conditions

This discussion describes the expected traffic operations under 2030 Conditions with all of the
proposed General Plan amendments in place. This scenario includes model-recommended roadway
traffic volumes plus vehicle trips generated by pending General Plan amendment land uses (including
the proposed project), as well as changes in travel patterns caused by City-proposed General Plan
amendment roadway network changes. The City`s travel demand forecasting model was used to
estimate 2030 General Plan Cumulative Condition traffic volumes. The proposed General Plan
amendment land use and network assumptions are briefly discussed and followed by a more detailed
discussion of the resulting intersection operations.

                 Land Use and Transportation Network General Plan Amendments

The City's travel demand forecasting model was used to develop 2030 General Plan Cumulative
traffic volume estimates. The 2030 General Plan Cumulative model includes all information from
2030 General Plan Baseline Conditions, plus changes in the land uses and roadway network based on
information from the eight pending General Plan amendments. In addition to the Hale-Signature

property General Plan amendment analyzed for the report, the following General Plan amendments
are included in the 2030 General Plan Cumulative Conditions' model:

       DeWitt-West Hills Community Church: Add parcels totaling 8.7 acres into the Urban Service
        Area and replace approximately 11,600 s.f. of church and school space with approximately
        20,000 s.f. of the same land use.

       Peet  Trumpp: Add 6 acres of single family residences on the west side of Peet Road and
        north of Half Road into the Urban Service Area.

       Monterey-Morgan Hill Bible Church: Add parcels totaling 8.7 acres into the Urban Service
        Area and replace approximately 11,600 s.f. of church and school space with approximately
        20,000 s.f. of the same land use.

       Watsonville-Royal Oaks Enterprises: Change one parcel from Single Family Medium (3-5
        du/ac) to Light Commercial/Residential on 8.19 acres at the southwest corner of Watsonville
        Road and Monterey Road, and change a second parcel from Single Family Medium to Multi-
        Family Medium (14-21 du/ac) on 7.5 acres on the Watsonville Road, west of Monterey Road.

       Walnut Grove Extension Realignment/Simonsen  DeRose Applications: Amend General
        Plan Land Use Designation from Multi-Family Low and Commercial to 100 percent
        Commercial. The anticipated square footage for the development will be approximately
        113,500 s.f.

       Butterfield-Berg & Berg: The proposed General Plan amendment will amend approximately
        56 acres of Industrial to a combination of Commercial and Multi-Family Low, Multi-Family
        Medium, and the new Single Family High (5-10 du/acre) land use designation the City is
        creating in conjunction with its 2009 Housing Element Update. The proposed land uses
        include approximately 446 small-lot single family residential units (which may be "senior
        housing" but which are analyzed as standard housing units), about 60 apartment units, and
        about 25,000 square feet of retail commercial uses. This project is generally bounded by the
        Union Pacific Railroad tracks to the west, Jarvis Drive to the north, Sutter Boulevard to the
        south, Butterfield Boulevard to the east.

       Downtown Specific Plan: This amendment also includes Downtown Redevelopment, Dunne
        Avenue/Depot Street. This application proposes to redevelop the Downtown area with
        approximately 1,204 residential units and approximately 186,000 s.f. of retail space relative
        to existing uses. The Downtown area is generally bounded by Depot Street on the east,
        Dunne Avenue on the south, Del Monte Street on the west and Main Avenue on the north.

In addition to the network changes based on the pending General Plan amendments, the 2030
General Plan Cumulative roadway network includes the "Model-Recommended Roadway Capacity
General Plan Amendments" and City-initiated roadway network amendments. Compared to the
network assumption under 2030 General Plan Baseline Conditions, the following roadway network
differences are relevant to the proposed project and study locations:

       Hale Avenue will be maintained as a two lane road and will not be widened to four lanes

       Madrone Parkway extension will be constructed as a two lane road instead of four lanes

                Cumulative General Plan Amendment Intersection Levels of Service

2030 General Plan Cumulative intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak-hour
turning movement volumes were used as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of the LOS
analysis for 2030 General Plan Cumulative Conditions are presented in Table 4.15-9. Measured
against the 2001 General Plan Circulation Element LOS standards, the following study intersection
will operate unacceptably under this scenario:

        Hale Avenue/Tilton Avenue  This all-way stop controlled intersection will operate at LOS E
         with an average delay of 42.2 seconds during the AM peak period. The northbound approach
         would operate at LOS F and the southbound and westbound approaches would operate at
         LOS B or better.

The signalized Monterey Road/Madrone Parkway intersection would operate at LOS D with 41.7
second of average intersection delay during the morning peak period. This intersection is one of
three signalized intersections that the City's LOS standards allows to operate at LOS D (up to 55
seconds of delay); therefore this intersection would operate acceptably. The remaining six study
intersections are projected to operate at acceptable LOS D+ or better.

                 Cumulative General Plan Amendment Signal Warrant Analysis

The peak-hour signal warrant from the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) was
evaluated for the unsignalized intersection that is projected to operate unacceptably under 2030
General Plan Cumulative Conditions to determine if a traffic signal is warranted. Under this
scenario, the Hale Avenue/Tilton Avenue intersection would operate at unacceptable LOS E with
42.2 seconds of delay during the morning peak hour and at acceptable LOS C during the evening
peak hour. The result of the peak-hour warrant analysis indicates that the intersection does not
satisfy the peak hour warrant analysis (refer to Appendix A).

            Cumulative General Plan Amendment Intersection Operations Summary

Based on the City of Morgan Hill's LOS standards and adopted thresholds of significance, none of
the study intersections are projected to be significantly impacted by the proposed project. Thus, no
intersection mitigation measures are required.

The unsignalized Hale Avenue/Tilton Avenue intersection is expected to operate at unacceptable
levels during the AM peak hour. However, this intersection would not meet the Peak Hour Warrant
for traffic signal installation during either peak period. Based on the City's adopted thresholds of
significance for impact criteria, this intersection would not be considered to have a significant
cumulative impact and signalization would not be required.

4.15.3          Conclusion

The proposed implementation of the General Plan Amendment would not result in significant
impacts to the transportation system. (Less Than Significant Impact)

4.16            UTILITIES AND SERVICE SYSTEMS

4.16.1          Setting

4.16.1.1        Water Service

The City of Morgan Hill provides potable water service to its residential, commercial, industrial, and
institutional customers within the City limits. The City's water system facilities include 14
groundwater wells, 10 potable water storage tanks, 10 booster stations, and over 160 miles of
pressured pipes ranging from two to 14 inches in diameter. There is an existing 10-inch or greater
water main in Monterey Road. 16

4.16.1.2        Sanitary Sewer Service

The City of Morgan Hill sewer collection system consists of approximately 135 miles of six-inch
through 30-inch diameter sewers, and includes 15 sewage lift stations and associated force mains.
The system also consists of trunk sewers, which are generally 12 inches in diameter and larger, that
convey the collected wastewater flows through an outfall that continues south to the Wastewater
Treatment Facility (WWTF) in Gilroy. The WWTF is jointly owned by the cities of Gilroy and
Morgan Hill. The City's existing sewer collection system meets the needs of existing customers.
The City has planned and constructed sewer facilities in conjunction with new street construction in
anticipation of future growth and sewage needs. There is an existing 15-inch sewer line in Monterey
Road. 17

4.16.1.3        Storm Drainage

The City of Morgan Hill's storm drainage system consists of a combination of curb and gutter
facilities, curb inlets, underground pipelines, and bubblers that drain into detention basins or to the
nearest creek. Creeks within the City of Morgan Hill flow to either Monterey Bay or San Francisco
Bay. Storm water runoff from the project site and surrounding area is released into Fisher Creek,
which drains to the San Francisco Bay. 18 An existing storm drainage pipeline is located on the
southeastern border of the site.

4.16.1.4        Other Services

South Valley Disposal & Recycling, Inc. (SVDR) provides solid waste and recycling services to the
businesses and residents of the cities of Morgan Hill and Gilroy and the surrounding Unincorporated
Southern Santa Clara County. South Valley Disposal and Recycling, Inc. has contracted through
2017 with the Salinas Valley Solid Waste Authority to dispose of municipal solid waste at Crazy
Horse Sanitary Landfill and Johnson Canyon Sanitary Landfill. Crazy Horse Sanitary Landfill is
anticipated to reach capacity in 2009 and Johnson Canyon Sanitary Landfill is anticipated to reach
capacity in 2043. 19

Pacific Gas and Electric provide electricity and natural gas to the project area.

4.16.2.1        Impacts from the Proposed Project

The project proponent proposes a General Plan amendment to change the land use designation on the
site from Public Facilities to Single Family Medium (3-5 dwelling units per acre). This will allow
the future development of up to 150 single-family units on the site.




City of Morgan Hill                                                                                          Initial Study

The potential addition of up to 150 residences on the project site would result in an increase in water
usage, sanitary sewer, waste generation, electricity, and gas usage from the site. Residential
development would be subject to the City's Residential Development Control System (RDCS). The
RDCS process would ensure consistency with the growth rate in the General Plan and, therefore,
would not exceed the City's planned water, wastewater treatment, or solid waste demand.

The proposed project, however, would increase the amount of impervious surfaces on the site,
therefore, increasing the amount of runoff generated by the proposed project.

4.16.2.1        Program Mitigation and Avoidance Measures

Many of the policies in the City's General Plan were adopted for the purpose of avoiding or
mitigating potential environmental effects that could result from planned development within the
City. All future development would be subject to General Plan policies, including the following,
conformance with which will reduce utilities and service system impacts to a less than significant
level:

                                       Morgan Hill General Plan

       Sewer Capacity, Water Supply and Storm Drainage Policy 20a - Expansion of the joint
        Gilroy/Morgan Hill Wastewater Treatment Facility should proceed, since additional sewer
        capacity is a prerequisite for further urban development and urban development is most
        appropriately served by sanitary sewer systems. (SCJAP 6.00)

       Sewer Capacity, Water Supply and Storm Drainage Policy 20c - Ensure that the total
        capacity for the Gilroy/Morgan Hill Wastewater Treatment Facility, its timing for
        completion, and configuration are consistent with SCJAP policies for the overall growth of
        Morgan Hill and Gilroy.

       Sewer Capacity, Water Supply and Storm Drainage Policy 21a - Manage the supply and use
        of water more efficiently through appropriate means, such as watershed protection,
        percolation, conservation and reclamation. (SCJAP 7.00)

       Sewer Capacity, Water Supply and Storm Drainage Policy 21b - Ensure that new
        development does not exceed the water supply. (SCJAP 7.08)

       Sewer Capacity, Water Supply and Storm Drainage Policy 22a - Address issues related to
        flooding throughout the city.

       Sewer Capacity, Water Supply and Storm Drainage Policy 22b - Ensure that those residents
        who benefit from, as well as those who contribute to the need for, local drainage facilities pay
        for them. (SCJAP 13.02)

       Water Quality Policy 6d - Work jointly with Gilroy and Santa Clara County to achieve a
        balance between potential negative impacts and the benefits associated with the location of
        solid waste disposal sites and transfer stations. (SCJAP 8.10)

Discussion: With the implementation of mitigation measures described in this report, the proposed
General Plan amendment, alone or considered in combination with other General Plan amendments,
would not result in significant environmental impacts. Future development on the site is subject to
applicable policies of the General Plan and existing laws and regulations as described in this Initial
Study.

4.17.1           Cumulative Global Climate Change Effects

Global climate change is the alteration of the Earth's weather including its temperature, precipitation,
and wind patterns. Global temperatures are affected by naturally occurring and anthropogenic-
generated atmospheric gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases allow
sunlight into the Earth's atmosphere, but prevent radiative heat from escaping into outer space, which
is known as the "greenhouse" effect. The world's leading climate scientists have reached consensus
that global climate change is underway and is very likely caused by humans. 20

Agencies at the international, national, state, and local levels are considering strategies to control
emissions of gases that contribute to global warming. There is no comprehensive strategy that is
being implemented on a global scale that addresses climate change; however, in California steps are
being taken to address climate change. A multi-agency "Climate Action Team" was set up to
implement Executive Order S-3-05 (signed by the Governor of California in 2005), under which the
state plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.

California Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), signed into law in 2006, requires achievement of a statewide
greenhouse gas emissions limit by 2020 equivalent to 1990 emissions. On December 11, 2008, the
California Air Resources Board (ARB) approved a key requirement of AB 32, the Climate Change
Scoping Plan. 21 The Scoping Plan proposes a comprehensive set of actions designed to reduce
overall carbon emissions in California, improve our environment, reduce our dependence on oil,
diversify our energy sources, save energy, and enhance public health while creating new jobs and
enhancing the growth in California's economy. The ARB is currently working on additional
regulations to implement the Scoping Plan. AB 32 requires the adoption of rules and regulations to
achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective greenhouse gas emissions
reductions by January 1, 2011.

4.17.1.1        Project Impacts

Currently there is no established guidance, from the state or in published CEQA case law, for the
determination of what constitutes a significant global climate change impact or what measures are
necessary to off-set new greenhouse gas emissions. The Governor's Office of Planning and Research
(OPR) is currently developing amendments to the CEQA Guidelines that will provide regulatory
guidance on the analysis and mitigation for Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) in CEQA documents.
Under Senate Bill 97, these amendments are to be adopted on or before January 1, 2010. In the
interim, OPR has prepared a technical guidance document regarding the steps lead agencies should
take to address climate change in their CEQA documents. 22 The guidance document recommends
that the Lead Agency identify individual or cumulative impacts of a project and mitigation measures
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation, electricity generation and use, and
other sources.

The proposed General Plan amendment would allow the future development of up to 150 single
family residences on the site. Projects such as the proposed future development would generate
greenhouse gases primarily through electricity use and generation of vehicle trips. It is estimated that
future development of 150 single family residences on the site would increase the emission of carbon
dioxide by approximately 2,684 tons (or 2,435 metric tons) per year, according to the
URBEMIS2007 model (refer to Appendix B). Construction of 150 single family residences would
result in the emission of approximately 415 tons (or 376 metric tons) of carbon dioxide.

In an effort to make a good faith effort at disclosing environmental impacts and to conform with the
CEQA Guidelines [16064(b)], it is the City's position that, based on the City's Residential
Development Control System (RDCS) ordinance which limits the level of residential growth in the
City to 48,000 persons by the year 2020, and the nature and size of the proposed future development,
the proposed project would not impede the state's ability to reach the emission reduction
limits/standards set forth by the State of California by Executive Order S-3-05 and AB 32. For these

change associated with greenhouse gas emissions.

Conclusion: The proposed project would not result in significant unavoidable impacts or substantial
new cumulative impacts associated with greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) conducted for the proposed
modification in land use designation of the Hale Signature Property in the City of Morgan Hill, California. The
proposed general plan amendment (GPA) will convert 30 vacant acres of Public Facilities to Single Family
Residential Medium (3 to 5 dwelling units per acre) use. The project site is bounded by the Union Pacific Railroad
tracks to the east, residential uses to the south (Campoli Drive) and north (Tarragon Avenue), and Hale Avenue to
the west. To present a more conservative analysis, this report analyzes the project's potential transportation
impacts based on the maximum density (5 units per acre) allowed for the Single Family Residential Medium use.
Therefore, the proposed GPA was assumed to include the development of 150 single family homes.

The purpose of the TIA is to identify any potential significant adverse impacts of the proposed GPA on the
surrounding transportation system and to recommend mitigation measures, if needed. Impacts were evaluated
following the guidelines of the City of Morgan Hill and the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), the congestion
management agency for Santa Clara County.

PROJECT TRIPS
The proposed GPA allows for the development of up to 150 single family homes on the 30-acre project site based
on the proposed modification in land use designate to Single Family Residential Medium (3 to 5 dwelling units per
acre). Trip generation rates for the GPA were estimated based on rates published for Single-Family Detached
Housing (ITE 210) land use in the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation 8th Edition. The
proposed GPA is estimated to generate 1,510 daily trips, 115 AM peak-hour trips and 151 PM peak-hour trips.

2030 GENERAL PLAN CONDITIONS INTERSECTION IMPACTS
Based on impact criteria defined by the City of Morgan Hill the proposed GPA is expected to have less-than-
significant impacts at all of the study intersections. Thus, no measures are necessary to mitigate project impacts.
The results of the level of service (LOS) calculations for all scenarios analyzed for this TIA are summarized in
Table ES-1.

FREEWAY SEGMENT IMPACTS
Based on the VTA's Congestion Management Program guidelines for freeway analyses, the project is not
expected to have a significant impact on the freeway study segments located on US 101.

2030 GENERAL PLAN CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
Based on the City of Morgan Hill's LOS standards, all intersections are projected to operate at acceptable service
levels with the exception of the unsignalized intersection of Hale Avenue/Tilton Avenue. This intersection is
projected to operate at unacceptable LOS E during the morning peak hour. However, the peak hour volume
warrant is not met, and the project would not result in a significant impact at this intersection based on the City's
impact criteria. The results of the level of service (LOS) calculations for all scenarios analyzed for this TIA are
summarized in Table ES-1.

1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) conducted for the proposed
modification in land use designation of the Hale Signature Property in the City of Morgan Hill, California. The
proposed general plan amendment (GPA) will convert 30 vacant acres of Public Facilities to Single Family
Residential Medium (3 to 5 dwelling units per acre) use. The project site is bounded by the Union Pacific Railroad
tracks to the east, residential uses to the south (Campoli Drive) and north (Tarragon Avenue), and Hale Avenue to
the west. The project site location is shown on the map on Figure 1. Since the proposed project is a GPA and
does not include a specific development proposal, no site plan is currently available for the project. To present a
more conservative analysis this report analyzes the project's potential transportation impacts based on the
maximum density (5 units per acre) allowed for the Single Family Residential Medium use. Therefore, the
proposed GPA was assumed to include the development of 150 single family homes.

The purpose of the TIA is to identify potential significant adverse impacts of the proposed GPA on the surrounding
transportation system and to recommend mitigation measures, if needed. Impacts were evaluated following the
guidelines of the City of Morgan Hill and the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), the congestion management
agency for Santa Clara County.

This analysis evaluated the operations of eight (8) study intersections, which were selected in consultation with
City staff and based on VTA's guidelines for selecting study intersections:

    1. Hale Avenue and Tilton Avenue                             5. Monterey Road and Burnett Avenue

    2. Hale Avenue and Madrone Parkway (future                   6. Monterey Road and Madrone Parkway
       intersection)
                                                                 7. Monterey Road and Cochrane Road
    3. Hale Avenue and Llagas Road
                                                                 8. Monterey Road and Old Monterey Road
    4. Monterey Road and Tilton Avenue
All intersections are under the jurisdiction of the City of Morgan Hill. Per the City's July 2001 General Plan, the
Madrone Parkway extension crossing between Monterey Road and Hale Avenue is assumed in the 2030 roadway
network. This roadway bisects the 30 acre Hale Signature property.

This study also included evaluation the following US 101 freeway segments (northbound and southbound):

       US 101 between Cochrane Road and Coyote Creek Road

       US 101 between Cochrane Road and Dunne Avenue

Peak traffic conditions generally occur during weekday mornings between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and between
4:00p.m. and 6:00 p.m. in the evenings. The operations of the study intersections were evaluated during the
weekday morning (AM) and evening (PM) peak hours for the following four (4) scenarios:

        Scenario 1:      Existing Conditions  Existing volumes obtained from counts, representing peak one-hour
                         traffic conditions during the morning and evening commute periods .

        Scenario 2:      2030 General Plan Baseline Conditions  2030 cumulative traffic volumes based on City
                         provided land use that includes approved and pending development projects, plus
                         roadway improvements from the July 2001 General Plan Circulation Element, which
                         includes the Madrone Parkway extension between Monterey Road and Hale Avenue.



                                                                                                         1

        Scenario 3:      2030 General Plan with Project Conditions  Traffic projections from Scenario 3 plus
                         traffic estimates from the proposed GPA.

        Scenario 4:      2030 General Plan Cumulative with Conditions  Traffic generated by the 2030 General
                         Plan land uses (Scenario 2) plus trips from the proposed project plus traffic from other
                         pending GPAs.

Intersection impacts of the proposed GPA were evaluated by comparing operations with the 2030 General Plan
with Project Conditions (Scenario 3) to Existing Conditions (Scenario 1) and 2030 General Plan Baseline
Conditions (Scenario 2). Intersection operations under 2030 General Plan Cumulative Conditions are presented
for information purposes to the cumulative impacts of all proposed GPAs in the City of Morgan Hill. The City's
travel demand forecasting model was used to estimate traffic volumes for the 2030 scenarios under scenarios 2
and 4. Freeway impacts of the proposed GPA were evaluated following VTA guidelines and were assessed by
adding project trips to freeway volumes established under Existing Conditions (Scenario 1). Project impacts on
bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities and services were also addressed.

The remainder of this report is divided into three chapters.

       Chapter 2  Existing Conditions

       Chapter 3  2030 General Plan Conditions

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the existing conditions of the roadway facilities, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, transit
service, traffic volumes, and intersection operations. A discussion of the method used to calculate intersection
levels of service (LOS) and the corresponding results is also presented in this chapter.

EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK
This section describes the existing roadway network, which is illustrated on Figure 1. Regional access to the site
is provided via US 101 and local access is provided via Monterey Road, Cochrane Road, Madrone Parkway,
Llagas Road, and Tilton Avenue. Each of these roadways is described below:

U.S. Highway 101 (US 101) is a north-south freeway that serves as the primary roadway connection between
Morgan Hill and all other areas of Santa Clara County. US 101 extends north to San Francisco and south to Los
Angeles. The freeway includes six lanes (three mixed-flow lanes in each direction) within most of Morgan Hill.
North of Cochrane Road, US 101 widens to eight lanes including three mixed-flow lanes and one high occupancy
vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction. HOV lanes, also known as diamond or carpool lanes, restrict use to vehicles
with two or more persons (carpool, vanpool, and buses) or motorcycles during the morning (5:00 AM to 9:00 AM)
and evening (3:00 PM to 7:00 PM) commute periods. The Cochrane Road interchange provides primary access
to the project site.

Monterey Road, through Morgan Hill, is generally a four-lane arterial roadway with separate left-turn lanes at
intersections and on-street parking in some areas. Monterey Road extends from San Jose through the downtown
area of Morgan Hill to the City of Gilroy. The speed limit on Monterey Road varies from 45 miles per hour (mph)
north of Cochrane Road to 25 mph between Main Avenue and East Dunne Avenue in downtown. Several sets of
speed lumps slow traffic through the downtown area.

Cochrane Road is an arterial that extends from Monterey Road east to Anderson Lake. Cochrane Road is a two-
to six-lane facility that provides an interchange with US 101 at the north end of the city. The posted speed limit is
45 mph.

Madrone Parkway is a two-lane undivided collector that extends eastward from its intersection with Monterey
Road and connects with Cochrane Road. The roadway is posted at 35 mph. Per the City's July 2001 General
Plan, Madrone Parkway will be extended westward to provide a connection between Monterey Road and Hale
Avenue. This extension is assumed in the 2030 roadway network.

Llagas Road is a collector that extends eastward from the City's western city limits to Old Monterey Road. The
posted speed limit is 25 mph. Between Old Monterey Road and Llagas Creek Drive, the roadway is a two-lane
road that provides left-turn lanes into the intersecting local streets. West of Llagas Creek Drive, Llagas Road is a
two-lane facility.

Tilton Avenue is two-lane collector road that provides a connection between Hale Avenue and Monterey Road.
The posted speed limit is 35 mph.

EXISTING PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE FACILITIES
The mild climate, relatively flat terrain, and proximity of many recreational and non-recreational destinations
provide an ideal environment for walking and bicycling in the City of Morgan Hill. This section describes the
existing pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure.




                                                                                                           4

Pedestrian Facilities

Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian signals, and off-street paths that are meant to
provide safe and convenient routes for pedestrians to access destinations such as institutions, businesses, public
transportation, and recreation facilities.

Crosswalks are not provided on Tilton Avenue/Hale Avenue and Monterey Road/Tilton Avenue. Other study
intersections provide limited crosswalks in each direction to bring continuity with adjacent sidewalks. Sidewalk
facilities are provided in the following roadway segments within the vicinity of the project.

       Eastside of Hale Avenue between Tilton Avenue and northern end of the project parcel;

       Llagas Road between Hale Avenue and Old Monterey Avenue;

       Westside of Old Monterey Avenue between Llagas Road and Monterey Road;

       Eastside of Monterey Road between Cochrane Road and Old Monterey Road;

       Discontinuous segments alone Monterey Road between Tilton Avenue and Cochrane Road.

Bicycle Facilities

Bikeway planning and design in California typically relies on the guidelines and design standards established by
                                                                                             th
Caltrans in the Highway Design Manual (Chapter 1000: Bikeway Planning and Design, 5 Edition, California
Department of Transportation, January 2001). Chapter 1000 follows standards developed by the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA), and identifies specific design standards for various conditions and bikeway-to-roadway relationships.
Under California Law, bicyclists are allowed to use all roadways in California unless posted closed. Therefore,
even for the roadways that have no designated (or planned) bikeways identified, a majority are open for cycling.

Caltrans standards provide for three (3) distinct types of bikeway facilities, as generally described below and
shown on the accompanying figures.

       Class I Bikeway (Bike Path) provides a completely separate right-of-way and is designated for the
        exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians with vehicle and pedestrian cross-flow minimized. In general,
        bike paths serve corridors not served by streets and highways or where sufficient right-of-way exists to
        allow such facilities to be constructed away from the influence of parallel streets and numerous vehicle
        conflicts.




                                                                                                        5

       Class II Bikeways (Bike Lanes) are lanes for bicyclists adjacent to the outer vehicle travel lanes. These
        lanes have special lane markings, pavement legends, and signage. Bicycle lanes are generally five (5)
        feet wide. Adjacent vehicle parking and vehicle/pedestrian cross-flow are permitted.




       Class III Bikeway (Bike Route) are designated by signs or pavement markings for shared use with
        pedestrians or motor vehicles, but have no separated bike right-of-way or lane striping. Bike routes serve
        either to: a) provide continuity to other bicycle facilities, or b) designate preferred routes through high
        demand corridors.




Figure 2 shows the existing bicycle facilities in and near the project site. No Class I bike paths exist in the project
vicinity. Class II bike are located along the following roadways in the study area:

       Monterey Road north of Cochrane Road;

       Monterey Road south of Old Monterey Road;

       Cochrane Road between Monterey Road and Sutter Boulevard;

       Hale Avenue; and

       Llagas Road west of Monterey Road.

Class III bike routes are provided on Monterey Road between Cochrane Road and Old Monterey Road.

EXISTING TRANSIT SERVICE
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) operates fixed route, commuter, and paratransit bus
service and light rail service (LRT) in Santa Clara County. VTA provides two bus routes (one local and one
regional) that serve the project area. The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board operates Caltrain commuter rail

service between San Francisco and San Jose, with weekday commute-hour service to Morgan Hill and Gilroy.
Existing transit service near the project is illustrated on Figure 3 and is discussed in more detail below.

Route 16, a local community bus, provides service between the Morgan Hill Civic Center and Burnett Avenue.
Service operates on weekdays only, every 60 minutes from 6:30 AM to 6:00 PM.

Route 68, a regional bus route, provides service between the City of Gilroy Caltrain/Greyhound Station and the
San Jose Diridon Caltrain Station. Service operates on weekdays every 30 minutes from 4:15 AM to 1:20 AM and
on weekends every 30 minutes from 5:45 AM to 1:20 AM.

Caltrain provides frequent daily train service between San Jose and San Francisco. Service extends south to
Gilroy through Morgan Hill during commute periods, with three northbound trips during the AM peak period and
three southbound trips during the PM peak period stopping at the Morgan Hill Caltrain Station located on
Monterey Road south of Main Street.

EXISTING VOLUMES AND LANE CONFIGURATIONS
The operations of the study intersections were evaluated during the weekday AM and PM peak hours.
Intersection operations were evaluated for the highest one-hour volume counted between each of the 7:00 and
9:00 AM and the 4:00 and 6:00 PM peak periods. Intersection turning movement counts were conducted in May
2008. The traffic counts are included in Appendix A.

Figure 4 presents the existing AM and PM peak-hour turning movement volumes, the existing intersection lane
configurations, and traffic control devices for the eight study intersections.

EXISTING LEVEL OF SERVICE METHODS AND POLICIES
The operations of roadway facilities are described with the term level of service (LOS). LOS is a qualitative
description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six levels
are defined from LOS A, with the least congested operating conditions, to LOS F, with the most congested
operating conditions. LOS E represents "at-capacity" operations. Operations are designated as LOS F when
volumes exceed capacity, resulting in stop-and-go conditions.

Signalized Intersections

The LOS method for signalized intersections approved by the City of Morgan Hill and VTA analyzes intersection
operations based on average control vehicular delay, as described in Chapter 16 of the 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM) published by the Transportation Research Board, with adjusted saturation flow rates to reflect
conditions in Santa Clara County. Control delay includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped
delay, and final acceleration delay. The average control delay for signalized intersections is calculated using
TRAFFIX analysis software and is correlated to a LOS designation as shown in Table 1.

Unsignalized Intersections

Operations of the unsignalized study intersections are evaluated using the method contained in Chapter 17 of the
2000 HCM and calculated using TRAFFIX analysis software. LOS ratings for stop-sign controlled intersections
are based on the average control delay expressed in seconds per vehicle. At two-way or side-street-stop
controlled intersections, control delay is calculated for each movement, not for the intersection as a whole. For

way stop-controlled locations, a weighted average delay for the entire intersection is presented. Table 2
summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections.

General Plan Circulation Element LOS Policy

The City of Morgan Hill currently maintains a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D+ (i.e., less than 39.0
seconds of delay) for local signalized intersections and LOS E at freeway ramp intersections. Per the City of
Morgan Hill General Plan (July 2001), the Madrone Parkway/Monterey Road study intersection is one of three
signalized intersections that are allowed to operate at LOS D (up to 55 seconds of delay), where achieving LOS
D+ would require extraordinary development expenditure and right-of-way acquisition.

The City has generally used a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D for unsignalized intersections and
peak hour signal warrant analysis to identify significant traffic impacts.

Freeway Segments

Freeway segments are evaluated using VTA's analysis procedure, which is based on the density of the traffic flow
using methods described in the 2000 HCM. Density is expressed in passenger cars per mile per lane. The
Congestion Management Program range of densities for freeway segment level of service is shown in Table 3.
The LOS standard for the freeway segments is LOS E.

EXISTING INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Existing intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak-hour turning movement volumes as illustrated
on Figure 4 were used as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for Existing Conditions
are presented in Table 4. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation sheets. Measured against the City
of Morgan Hill LOS standard, all study intersections currently operate at acceptable LOS D+ or better during both
peak periods.

FIELD OBSERVATIONS
Field observations of the study intersections were conducted in April 2008 to verify their operations. In general,
observations indicated that all of the study intersections are operating at or near the calculated levels of service.
Queuing was observed at Monterey Road/Burnett Avenue, Cochrane Avenue/Monterey Road, and Old Monterey
Road/Monterey Road. However, most of the vehicle queues typically cleared these intersections within one cycle.
The unsignalized intersection of Hale Avenue/Tilton Avenue was observed to operate acceptably with no
significant queuing.

Field observations at the intersection of Tilton Avenue/Monterey Road verified a preemption phase due to the
passing of trains on the nearby railroad tracks. While the presence of a train temporarily causes queuing that
substantially exceeds typical operations, regular operations and cycle lengths were observed to resume within
two signal cycles or less than five (5) minutes after a train departed the area.

3. 2030 GENERAL PLAN CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the expected traffic operations under 2030 General Plan Conditions with and without the
proposed GPA. The City of Morgan Hill travel demand forecasting model was used to estimate 2030 traffic
volumes. 2030 land use and network assumptions are briefly discussed below and followed by a more detailed
discussion of intersection operations.

LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION NETWORK ASSUMPTIONS
The City's travel demand forecasting model was used to develop 2030 General Plan traffic volume estimates.
2030 land use estimates were based on input from City staff and regionally approved data from the Association of
Bay Area Governments (ABAG). Under 2030 General Plan Baseline Conditions the model includes agricultural
land uses for the project site. To present a more conservative approach, project trips associated with the GPA
were added to the 2030 General Plan Baseline volumes and no trip credits were taken for the agricultural uses
modeled for the site. Included in the model is the planned roadway network based on the 2001 General Plan
Circulation Element. Planned roadway network improvements relevant to the project include:

     1. Construction of the Madrone Parkway as a 4 lane roadway extension between Monterey Road and Hale
        Avenue bisecting the project property and including an underpass at Monterey Road;
     2. Construction of the Llagas Creek Drive as a 2 lane collector between Hale Avenue and Monterey Road;
     3. Widening of Hale Avenue from 2 to 4 lanes from Tilton Avenue to Main Street;
     4. Widening of Monterey Road from 4 to six lanes north of Cochrane Road;
     5. Widening of Monterey Road from 2 to 4 lanes south of Cochrane Road; and
     6. Widening of Cochrane Road from 4 to six lanes east of Monterey Road.

2030 GENERAL PLAN BASELINE INTERSECTION TRAFFIC VOLUME ESTIMATES
Using the base year and future year model forecasts, we developed weekday peak-hour forecasts for
intersection turning movements at the eight (8) key intersections within the study area for 2030 General Plan
Baseline Conditions.

For this study, we applied the guidelines published in National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP)
Report 255 1 to refine the raw model forecasts. This method is based on the difference between counts and model
volumes and helps to provide more reasonable forecasts.

Figure 5 illustrates the AM and PM peak hour intersection turning movement forecasts volumes, intersection lane
configurations, and traffic control devices for the study intersections under 2030 General Plan Baseline
Conditions.

2030 GENERAL PLAN BASELINE WITH PRJOECT TRAFFIC VOLUME ESTIMATES
The amount of traffic associated with the project was estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2)
trip distribution, and (3) trip assignment. In the first step, the amount of traffic entering and exiting the project area
was estimated on a daily and peak-hour basis. In the second step, the direction vehicles use to approach and
depart the site was estimated. The trips were assigned to specific street segments and intersection turning
movements in the third step and added to the 2030 General Plan Baseline traffic volumes to develop 2030
General Plan Baseline with Project traffic volumes. The results of the process for this analysis are described in
the following sections.

Trip Generation

The proposed GPA allows for the development of up to 150 single family homes on the 30 acres project site. Trip
generation was calculated using rates from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation (8th
Edition). The peak-hour trip generation trip estimates for each phase are presented in Table 6. A 150 single
family home development is estimated to generate 1,510 daily trips, 115 AM peak-hour trips (29 inbound and 86
outbound), and 151 PM peak-hour trips (95 inbound and 56 outbound).

Trip Distribution

Project trip distribution was primarily based on a select zone analysis using the City's travel demand forecasting
model. Location of supporting land uses in the vicinity of the project area, information from previous traffic studies
in the area, and input from City staff was used to refine the trip distribution. Figure 6 shows the proposed trip
distribution for the project. Approximately 40 percent of trips are expected to travel north of the City of Morgan Hill
and 25 percent to destinations south of the City. The remaining trips are spread to destinations within the City of
Morgan Hill.

Trip Assignment

Trips generated by the proposed project were assigned to the roadway system based on the directions of
approach and departure described above. Peak hour project trips are shown on Figure 6. Project-generated trips
were added to the 2030 General Plan Baseline volumes to estimate volumes under 2030 General Plan Baseline
with Project Conditions, which are shown on Figure 7.

2030 GENERAL PLAN INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE
Existing intersection configurations were modified to accommodate the proposed Madrone Parkway extension
crossing between Monterey Road and Hale Avenue and widened roadways (e.g. Monterey Road widened from 2
to 4 lanes south of Cochrane Road and Hale Avenue widened from 2 to 4 lanes between Tilton Avenue and Main
Street). The lane geometries and signal controls for 2030 General Plan Baseline with Project Conditions are
illustrated on Figure 7.

2030 General Plan roadway intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak-hour turning movement
volumes were used as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for 2030 General Plan with
Project Conditions are presented in Table 7. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation sheets.
Measured against the City's current LOS D+ standard for signalized intersections (LOS D is acceptable for the
Madrone Parkway/Monterey Road intersection) all of the study intersection would operate at acceptable levels.

2030 GENERAL PLAN SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS
The peak-hour signal warrant from the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) was evaluated for
the unsignalized intersection that operates unacceptably under 2030 General Plan Conditions to determine if a
traffic signal is warranted. The unsignalized Hilton Avenue/Tilton Avenue intersection is projected to operate at
acceptable levels in 2030, and no signal warrant analysis was performed.

2030 GENERAL PLAN FREEWAY ANALYSIS
According to CMP guidelines, freeway segments to which a proposed development is projected to add trips equal
to or greater than one percent of the freeway segment's capacity must be evaluated. The freeway segments
immediately north and south of Cochrane Road were reviewed to determine if a significant amount of project
traffic would be added to these freeway segments. Capacities of 2,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for
freeway segments with three or more lanes and capacities of 2,200 vphpl for freeway segments with two lanes
were used in the freeway analysis. To be conservative, no project trips were assigned to HOV lanes.

Table 8 outlines the estimated number of net new trips added to the freeway segments under 2030 General Plan
with Project Conditions. The proposed project would not add new trips greater than one percent of the freeway
segment capacity to any of the study freeway segments. Therefore, no additional freeway segment analysis is
required for the proposed project.

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT CRITERIA
The results of the level of service calculations for Existing Conditions were compared to the results for 2030
General Plan Baseline with Project Conditions to identify significant impacts. The following standards of
significance apply to the transportation impacts discussed in this study. These standards are consistent with the
Guidelines for Preparation of Transportation Impact Reports (City of Morgan Hill, May 2008).

Signalized Intersection Impact Criteria

The City's LOS standard for City intersections is LOS D+ (i.e. less than 39.0 seconds of delay). Per the General
Plan (July 2001), the Madrone Parkway/Monterey Road study intersection is one of three signalized intersections
that are allowed to operate at LOS D (up to 55 seconds of delay), where achieving LOS D+ would require
extraordinary development expenditure and right-of-way acquisition.

The City of Morgan Hill has adopted the signalized intersection impact criteria as defined by the VTA, the
Congestion Management Agency for Santa Clara County. Therefore, traffic impacts at City of Morgan Hill
intersections would occur when the addition of traffic associated with implementation of the Project causes:

      1. Intersection operations to deteriorate from an acceptable level (LOS D+ or better for most intersections
         and LOS D or better for the Madrone Parkway/Monterey Road intersection) under the Existing
         Conditions to an unacceptable level ( LOS D or worse for most intersections and LOS D- or worse for
         the Madrone Parkway/Monterey Road intersection); or,
      2. Exacerbation of unacceptable operations under Existing Conditions by increasing the average
         critical delay by more than 4 seconds and increasing the critical volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio by




                                                                                                                 22
Hale Signature Properties 
Draft Report

          0.01 or more at an intersection operating at LOS E or LOS F under 2030 General Plan Baseline with
          Project Conditions.
None of the intersections analyzed for this report are designated Congestion Management Program (CMP)
intersections.

Unsignalized Intersection Impact Criteria

Levels of service analysis at unsignalized intersections are generally used to determine the need for modification
in type of intersection control (i.e. all-way stop or signalization). As part of this evaluation traffic volumes, delay,
and traffic signal warrants are evaluated to determine if the existing intersection control is appropriate.

The City has generally used a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D for unsignalized intersections.
Significant impacts are defined to occur when the addition of Project traffic the worst movement/approach to
degrade to LOS E or LOS F and the intersection satisfies the peak hour signal warrants from the MUTCD.

Freeway Impact Criteria

According to VTA's Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines (VTA, 1998) a freeway segment analysis should
be included if the project meets one of the following requirements:

    1.   The proposed development project is expected to add traffic equal to at least one percent of a freeway
         segment's capacity.
    2.   The proposed development project is adjacent to one of the freeway segment's access or egress points
    3.   Based on engineering judgment, Lead Agency staff determines that the freeway segment should be
         included in the analysis.
According to CMP guidelines, freeway segments with project traffic equal to or greater than one percent of the
freeway segment's capacity must be evaluated. For mixed-flow lanes, freeway segment capacities are defined as
2,200 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for four-lane freeway segments and 2,300 vphpl for six-lane freeway
segments. HOV lane capacities are defined between 1,800 to 1,900 vphpl.

If a project meets the criteria outlined above, then the implementation of the proposed project could result in a
significant impact if the addition of project traffic on a freeway segment exceeded one of the following thresholds:

    1. The addition of project traffic causes the operating level of a freeway segment to deteriorate from LOS E
       or better under Existing Conditions to LOS F; or
    2. The number of new trips added by a proposed project to a segment already operating at LOS F under
       Existing Conditions is more than one percent of the freeway segment capacity.

INTERSECTION IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The impacts of the proposed project were evaluated by comparing intersection operations with the 2030 General
Plan Baseline with Project to the 2030 General Plan Baseline Conditions using the 2001 General Plan Circulation
Element LOS policies and the significance criteria described above. Based on the analysis presented above the
proposed GPA would have a less-than-significant impact on the study intersections.

FREEWAY IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The freeway impacts of the proposed GPA were evaluated based on VTA's guidelines. As shown in Table 8, the
project is not projected to add new trips greater than one percent of the freeway segment capacity to any of the
study freeway segments. Therefore, no additional freeway segment analysis is required for the proposed project
and the GPA would have a less-than-significant impact on the study freeway segments.

PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE, AND TRANSIT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The City's Guidelines for Preparation of Transportation Impact Reports does not specify impact criteria for
pedestrian, bicycle, and transit impacts. However, these impacts are generally evaluated based on whether a
proposed project would: 1) conflict with existing or planned pedestrian, bicycle, or transit facilities, or 2) create
walking, bicycling, or transit use demand without providing adequate and appropriate facilities for non-motorized
mobility.

The proposed GPA is not expected to increase the biking, or transit demand to a level where it could not be
accommodated by existing or planned facilities. To accommodate pedestrian travel, development of the project
site should include the construction of sidewalks on Hale Avenue along the project frontage. On the east side of
the project site, the existing rail road tracks provide a barrier to Monterey Road. The construction of the Madrone
Parkway extension includes an underpass at Monterey Road and the railroad tracks. This project should provide
adequate pedestrian and bicycle access to facilitate connectivity between the proposed and existing residential
developments west of Monterey Road and the land uses to the east. With the provision of sidewalks on Hale
Avenue along the project frontage, the proposed GPA would have a less-than-significant impact on pedestrian,
bicycle, and transit facilities and services.

4. 2030 GENERAL PLAN CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the expected traffic operations under 2030 Conditions with all of the proposed GPAs in
place. This scenario includes model-recommended roadway traffic volumes plus vehicle trips generated by
pending GPA land uses (including the proposed GPA), as well as changes in travel patterns caused by City-
proposed GPA roadway network changes. The City`s travel demand forecasting model was used to estimate
2030 General Plan Cumulative Condition traffic volumes. The proposed GPA land use and network assumptions
are briefly discussed and followed by a more detailed discussion of the resulting intersection operations.

LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION NETWORK GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS
The City's travel demand forecasting model was used to develop 2030 General Plan Cumulative traffic volume
estimates. The 2030 General Plan Cumulative model includes all information from 2030 General Plan Baseline
Conditions, plus changes in the land uses and roadway network based on information from the eight pending
GPAs. In addition to the Hale Signature property GPA analyzed for the report, the following GPAs are included in
the 2030 General Plan Cumulative Conditions' model:

       West Hills Community Church USA: Add parcels totaling 8.7 acres into the Urban Service Area and
        replace approximately 11,600 s.f. of church and school space with approximately 20,000 s.f. of the same
        land use.

       Peet  Trumpp USA: Add 6 acres of single family residences on the west side of Peet Road and north of
        Half Road into the Urban Service Area.

       Monterey  Morgan Hill Bible Church GPA and USA: Add parcels totaling 8.7 acres into the Urban
        Service Area and replace approximately 11,600 s.f. of church and school space with approximately
        20,000 s.f. of the same land use.

       Watsonville  Royal Oaks GPA and USA: Change one parcel from Single Family Medium (3-5 du/ac) to
        Light Commercial/Residential on 8.19 acres at the southwest corner of Watsonville Road and Monterey
        Road, and change a second parcel from Single Family Medium to Multi-Family Medium (14-21 du/ac) on
        7.5 acres on the Watsonville Road, west of Monterey Road.

       Walnut Grove Extension Realignment/Simonsen  DeRose Applications (GPA): Amend General Plan
        Land Use Designation from Multi-Family Low and Commercial to 100 percent Commercial. The
        anticipated square footage for the development will be approximately 113,500 s.f.

       Berg & Berg GPA: The proposed GPA will amend approximately 56 acres of Industrial to a combination of
        Commercial and Multi-Family Low, Multi-Family Medium, and the new Single Family High (5-11 du/acre)
        land use designation the City is creating in conjunction with its 2009 Housing Element Update. The
        proposed land uses include approximately 446 small-lot single family residential units (which may be
        "senior housing" but which are analyzed as standard housing units), about 60 apartment units, and about
        25,000 square feet of retail commercial uses. This project is generally bounded by the Union Pacific
        Railroad tracks to the west, Jarvis Drive to the north, Sutter Boulevard to the south, Butterfield Boulevard
        to the east.

       Downtown Specific Plan: This amendment also includes Downtown Redevelopment, Dunne
        Avenue/Depot Street: This application proposes to redevelop the Downtown area with approximately
        1,204 residential units and approximately 186,000 s.f. of retail space relative to existing uses. The




                                                                                                         25

           Downtown area is generally bounded by Depot Street on the east, Dunne Avenue on the south, Del
           Monte Street on the west and Main Avenue on the north. The list of eight pending GPA includes the
           proposed GPA for the Hale-Signature Properties project.

In addition to the network changes bases on the pending GPAs, the 2030 General Plan Cumulative roadway
network includes the "Model-Recommended Roadway Capacity General Plan Amendments" and City-initiated
roadway network amendments. Compared to the network assumption under 2030 General Plan Baseline
Conditions, the following roadway network differences are relevant to the proposed GPA and study locations:

       1. Hale Avenue will be maintained as a 2 lane road and will not be widened to 4 lanes
       2. Madrone Parkway extension will be constructed as a 2 lane road instead of 4 lanes

All other network assumptions from the 2030 General Plan Baseline Conditions that are directly applicable to the
study intersection remain in effect.

GENERAL PLAN CUMULATIVE TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND LANE CONFIGURATIONS
The same forecast method discussed in Chapter 3 was used for the intersection study locations under 2030
General Plan Cumulative Conditions. Figure 8 shows the AM and PM peak hour intersection turning movement
forecasts volumes, intersection lane configurations, and traffic control devices for eight study intersections under
2030 General Plan Cumulative Conditions.

GENERAL PLAN CUMULATIVE INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
2030 General Plan Cumulative intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak-hour turning movement
volumes were used as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for 2030 General Plan
Cumulative Conditions are presented in Table 10. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation sheets.
Measured against the 2001 General Plan Circulation Element LOS standards, the following study intersection will
operate unacceptably under this scenario:

    Int. # 1.   Hale Avenue/Tilton Avenue  This all-way stop controlled intersection will operate at LOS E with an
                average delay of 42.2 seconds during the AM peak period. The northbound approach would operate
                at LOS F and the southbound and westbound approaches would operate at LOS B or better.

The Monterey Road/Madrone Parkway would operate at LOS D with 41.7 second of average intersection delay
during the morning peak period. This intersection is one three signalized intersections that the City's LOS
standards allows to operate at LOS D (up to 55 seconds of delay); therefore this intersection would operate
acceptably. The remaining six study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable LOS D+ or better.

GENERAL PLAN CUMULATIVE SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS
The peak-hour signal warrant from the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) was evaluated for
the unsignalized intersection that is projected to operate unacceptably under 2030 General Plan Cumulative
Conditions to determine if a traffic signal is warranted. 2 Under this scenario, the Hale Avenue/Tilton Avenue

    This analysis is intended to examine the general correlation between the planned level of future development and the need
    to install new traffic signals. It estimates future development-generated traffic compared against a sub-set of the standard
    traffic signal warrants recommended in the Federal Highway Administration Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and



                                                                                                                     26

intersection would operate at unacceptable LOS E with 42.2 seconds of delay during the morning peak hour and
at acceptable LOS C during the evening peak hour. The result of the peak-hour warrant analysis indicates that the
intersection does not satisfy the peak hour warrant analysis (see Appendix C).

 associated California MUTCD guidelines. This analysis should not serve as the only basis for deciding whether and when to
 install a signal. To reach such a decision, the full set of warrants should be investigated based on field-measured, rather
 than forecast, traffic data and a thorough study of traffic and roadway conditions by an experienced engineer. Furthermore,
 the decision to install a signal should not be based solely upon the warrants, since the installation of signals can lead to
 certain types of collisions. The City of Morgan Hill should undertake regular monitoring of actual traffic conditions and
 accident data, and timely re-evaluation of the full set of warrants in order to prioritize and program intersections for
 signalization.

GENERAL PLAN CUMULATIVE INTERSECTION OPERATIONS SUMMARY
Based on the City of Morgan Hill's LOS standards, none of the study intersections are projected to be significantly
impacted by the proposed GPA. Thus, no intersection mitigation measures are required.

The unsignalized intersection Hale Avenue/Tilton Avenue intersection is expected to operate at unacceptable
levels during the AM peak hour. However, this intersection would not meet the Peak Hour Warrant for traffic
signal installation during either peak period. Based on the City's impact criteria this intersection would not be
considered to have a significant impact and signalization would not be required. However, the City of Morgan Hill
should continue to monitor this location and conduct an engineering study to evaluate the need for signals and/or
turn movement restrictions as appropriate to maintain acceptable intersection operations.

    Warrant 3B: Peak Hour Volume
    The peak hour volume warrant is satisfied when the plotted point representing the vehicles per hour
    on the major street (total of both approaches) and the corresponding vehicles per hour of the higher
    volume minor street approach (one direction only) for one hour (any four consecutive 15-minute
    periods) of an average day falls above the curve in Figure 4-5 for the existing combination of

EXECUTIVESUMMARY
CHA conducted a study to evaluate the accident history and identify measures to improve safety at the
Bay Street and Sanford Street intersection, located in Glens Falls, New York. The tasks performed for
this traffic study included the following:

    1. Review of accident data for a 5-year period to determine the most frequent types of accidents
       and common contributing factors in those accidents.
    2. Collection of traffic data by means of field visit including manual turning movement counts,
       geometric measurements and signal timing and phasing.
    3. Analysis of collected traffic data.
    4. Development of measures to improve traffic and safety conditions at this intersection.

Bay Street and Sanford Street intersect at a four-way intersection operating under traffic signal control.
Each approach consists of a shared left/ through/right turn lane with parking permitted on both sides of
all approaches. Bay Street and Sanford Street are essentially straight and level. Pedestrians are
accommodated through a sidewalk on the both sides of Bay Street and Sanford Street with a utility strip
separating the concrete curb from the sidewalk. Pedestrian signals exist to accommodate crossings on
all approaches. There are no separate bicyclist accommodations. Bus stops exist on both the Bay Street
north and south approaches. There is street lighting and overhead utilities that run along the south side
of Sanford Street and the west side of Bay Street. The posted speed limits of Bay Street and Sanford
Street are 30 mph. Approximately 145 ft. south of this intersection, Hunter Street intersects Bay Street
at an unsignalized "T" intersection.

The accident analysis was performed for the Bay Street and Sanford Street intersection using accident
data provided by the City of Glens Falls Police Department. The analysis includes crashes for a five year
period that occurred from April 24, 2008 through April 24, 2013. Detailed accident summary sheet,
collision diagram, and detailed accident history are included in Appendix A.

There were 25 accidents at the Bay Street and Sanford Street intersection over the last five years. Based
on the data, 16 of these accidents occurred within the last three year period. There were 9 (36%)
injury, 13 (52%) property damage only, and 3 (12%) non-reportable or unknown accidents. There were
no fatalities. There were 5 accidents (20%) that occurred at the Bay Street and Hunter Street
intersection. The two predominate types of accidents were angle vehicle crashes and rear-end crashes,
although there was no identifiable pattern associated with the rear-end accidents. See Section 2.0C for
a complete discussion of the accident history.

A capacity analysis was performed for the PM peak period which shows that the intersection is
operating at an overall LOS B with all approaches operating at LOS A or B. See Sections 2.0D and 2.0E
for a complete discussion of the traffic volumes and capacity analysis.

Based upon a site visit and a review of the existing geometrics, operations and accident history, several
observations and potential contributing factors were identified and are discussed in Section 2.0B.
Among the observations are limited visibility of the traffic signals for the Sanford Street approaches and
close spacing and limited visibility for Hunter Street. Although the accident data did not indicate a
safety issue associated with pedestrians, some of the pedestrian signals were not functioning according



               Bay and Sanford Street, Glens Falls, NY: Safety Study                               Page 1
to the intended operation and the pedestrian signal at the northwest corner of the intersection was
missing at the time of this study due to an accident that occurred in April 2013.
Improvements have been identified for the City of Glens Falls' consideration to improve safety at this
intersection. Detailed descriptions of the recommended improvements are provided in Section 3.0 of
this report. These improvements include removing vegetation, modifying the pedestrian signals,
modifying the vehicular signals, removing or delineating the parking spaces and providing access
management.

A brief description of these improvements is as follows:

Vegetation
Trees, bushes and overgrown vegetation limit visibility at the northeast corner of the Bay Street and
Hunter Street intersection and along Sanford Street on the north side of the westbound approach. Lines
of sight should be maintained by trimming and removing as necessary, the trees, bushes and overgrown
vegetation.
PedestrianSignals
While the accident data did not indicate a safety issue, the pedestrian signals at the southwest and
southeast corners are not functioning according to the intended operation. The pushbuttons at the
southwest corner operate the opposite approach than designated by placement and signage (e.g.
button to cross Bay Street south leg operates Sanford Street west leg and the button to cross the
Sanford Street west leg operates the Bay Street south leg) and there is no accommodation to cross the
Bay Street south leg from the southeast corner, since the pedestrian button at the southeast corner
controls the Sanford Street west leg crossing. In addition, the pedestrian signal at the northwest corner
of the intersection is missing due to an accident that occurred in April 2013. The pushbuttons, signs and
pedestrian signals at the southeast and southwest corners should be corrected and the signal at the
northwest corner installed to accommodate pedestrian crossings through the intersection.

VehicularSignals
Sections 2.0B and 3.0 provide a detailed discussion of the placement, layout and visibility of the
vehicular traffic signals. Given the longitudinal positioning and the mounting height over the pavement,
the visibility of the signals may be a contributing factor in the accidents at this intersection.
    AdjustSignalHeadPosition
    The signals controlling the westbound approach should be lowered at least 2.5 to 3 feet. The signals
    controlling the eastbound approach should be lowered at least 1.5 to 2 feet. Determination of the
    need for lowering the mast arm, installing new or providing signal brackets to effectively lower the
    signals should be assessed. A detailed evaluation of the signals and the structural capacity of the
    supports will be necessary prior to implementing this measure. This evaluation could be
    approached by having a structural engineer review and evaluate the design shop drawings of the
    mast arm poles that were installed and/or work with the pole manufacturer to determine the ability
    of the poles to accept loading revisions based on their design load.

    Installbackplates 

    Backplates with retroreflective borders is a low cost safety treatment that can be added to the
    existing traffic signal indication. A signal head equipped with a backplate with a retroreflective
    border enhances the visibility of the illuminated signal faces, in both daytime and nighttime
    conditions, which has the potential to reduce unintentional red-light running crashes. Prior to
    implementing this measure, the structural capacity of the supports will need to be evaluated. An
    average estimated cost for a backplate with yellow retroreflective border is $120 to $150 per
    backplate.

AccessManagement
Five of the 25 accidents over the 5 year period occurred at the Bay Street and Hunter Street
intersection. Long term, evaluation of permitting only right turns in and right turns out of Hunter Street
and restricting left turn movements could be considered. This evaluation would need to consider the
impact the diverted left turn movements would have to the adjacent intersections.

1.0     INTRODUCTION
CHA conducted a study to evaluate and recommend measures to improve safety at the Bay Street and
Sanford Street intersection located in Glens Falls, New York. The study was initiated by a request from
the Glens Falls Police Department to the Adirondack/ Glens Falls Transportation Council (AGFTC) to
evaluate safety concerns at this intersection, which has been the location of several accidents over the
last few years. To address the concerns, AGFTC retained CHA to perform an analysis of existing traffic
and safety conditions at this intersection and to develop engineering solutions that will result in
improvements of the safety for all users, while minimizing impacts to the local community. Tasks
performed for this traffic study included the following:

    1. Review of accident data for a 5-year period to determine the most frequent types of accidents
       and common contributing factors in those accidents.
    2. Collection of traffic data by means of site visit including manual turning movement counts,
       geometric measurements and signal timing and phasing.
    3. Analysis of collected traffic data.
    4. Development of alternatives to improve traffic and safety conditions at this intersection.



2.0     EXISTINGCONDITIONS
    A. SITEAREA

Bay Street [CR 7] and Sanford Street are classified as Urban Minor Arterials. Bay Street is a north-south
roadway that intersects at Glen Street (US Route 9) at its southern end and extends northerly beyond
Douglas Street where it becomes Bay Road. It is generally a two-lane roadway that widens at various
intersections to accommodate turn lanes.

Sanford Street is an east-west roadway that intersects with Quaker Road (State Route (SR) 254) at its
easterly end and at Glen Street (US Route 9) at its westerly end. It is generally a two-lane roadway that
widens at select intersections to accommodate turn lanes. Sanford Street provides access to the old
Sanford Street School, now occupied by BOCES, which is located at the corner of Sanford Street and Ash
Avenue, west of the Sanford Street and Bay Street intersection. Sanford Street is a well-traveled
pedestrian route through the City to the Glens Falls High School, Glens Falls Middle School, and Jackson
Heights Elementary Schools.

The Bay Street and Sanford Street intersection is located in a highly urbanized setting. Land use of the
area within the intersection includes commercial establishments consisting of Bay Optical of Glens Falls
on the northwest corner, a strip building on the southwest corner consisting of multiple uses including
Bellaggio Pizza and Bellissima Salon, Global Tech & Media, Inc. on the north east corner and Main Moon
Chinese Restaurant on the southeast corner. Beyond the intersection along Bay Street, both to the
north and south, the land use is commercial and along Sanford Street, to the east and west the land use
is residential. The intersection is shown in the following Google aerial image below.

                                                                            Chinese

Bay Street and Sanford Street are essentially straight and level. The two streets are nearly
perpendicular but there is a slight horizontal curve on Sanford Street just west of the intersection.

Bay Street and Sanford Street intersect at a four-way intersection operating under traffic signal control.
Each approach consists of a shared left/ through/right turn lane with parking permitted on both sides of
all approaches. Parking areas on Bay Street are highlighted with a single white edge line but individual
spaces are not designated within these areas. On street parking is also permitted on both sides of
Sanford Street although no parking areas are defined with pavement markings. Pedestrians are
accommodated through a sidewalk on the both sides of Bay Street and Sanford Street with a utility strip
separating the concrete curb from the sidewalk. There are no separate bicyclist accommodations.

Each approach is controlled by a pair of standard 3-section vehicular signal heads vertically mounted on
mast arms. The mast arm poles are located on the northeast and southwest corners of the intersection
and are angled diagonally through the intersection. The existing operation of the signals consists of two
phases (Bay Street north/south and Sanford Street east/west). The north/south phase was observed to
be approximately 35 seconds with the east/west phase observed to be approximately 18 seconds for a
total cycle length of 65 seconds. Each phase included approximately 4 seconds yellow and 2 seconds all
red. The signal is not part of a coordinated system. No Turn on Red signs are mounted on the mast
arms for each of the approaches to the intersection. See Photo 1.

              Photo 1: On Bay Street looking south at Sanford Street




The height of the signals, from the top of pavement to the bottom of the signal head housing was
measured in the field. The signals that control the northbound and westbound approaches were at 20.5
ft. and 20.9 ft. The signals that control the southbound and eastbound approaches were approximately
19.5 ft. and 20 ft.

Pedestrian signals exist on each of the corners, consisting of one-section pedestrian signal heads with
the upraised hand and walking person symbol overlaid Photo 2: Pedestal pole on southeast corner
upon each other. No countdown timers exist at this
intersection. The pedestrian signal heads, buttons and
signs are mounted on the mast arm at the northeast and
southwest corners. At the southeast corner, the pedestrian
signals, pushbuttons and signs for crossing the south leg of
Bay Street and the east leg of Sanford Street are both
mounted on the same pedestal pole. At the time of this
study, the pedestrian signal at the northwest corner, which
would have consisted of the pedestrian signals,
pushbuttons and signs for crossing the north leg of Bay
Street and the west leg of Sanford Street, both mounted on
the same pedestal pole, was missing due to a recent accident that occurred which demolished the Bay
Optical sign and the pedestrian signals.




               Bay and Sanford Street, Glens Falls, NY: Safety Study                             Page 6
In addition, some of the existing pedestrian push buttons were not operating the intended approach as
noted below:

    Southwest corner pedestrian signal
    · Pushbutton to cross the Bay Street south leg operates the Sanford Street west leg crossing.
    · Pushbutton to cross the Sanford Street west leg operates the Bay Street south leg crossing.

    Southeast corner pedestrian signal
    · Pushbutton to cross the Bay Street south leg operates the Sanford Street west leg crossing.
       Hence, there is no accommodation for pedestrians to cross the Bay Street south leg from the
       southeast corner of the intersection.

Double yellow centerline and white lane line pavement markings along with the stop bars and crosswalk
markings exist on Bay Street. A double yellow centerline pavement marking exists for a minimal
distance along Sanford Street on both the east and west legs of the intersection with no other pavement
markings beyond that, aside from the stop bar and crosswalk lines.

A bus stop exists on both the Bay Street north and south approaches. There is street lighting and
overhead utilities that run along the south side of Sanford Street and the west side of Bay Street. The
posted speed limits of Bay Street and Sanford Street are 30 mph.

Hunter Street intersects Bay Street approximately 145 feet south of the Bay Street and Sanford Street
intersection. See Photo 3. Hunter Street is a two-lane east-west roadway that is Stop controlled and
intersects Bay Street forming an unsignalized "T" intersection. See Photo 4. The Hunter Street
westbound approach consists of a shared left/ right turn lane. Pedestrians are accommodated through
a sidewalk on both sides of Hunter Street with a grassed utility strip separating the concrete curb from
the sidewalk. There are no separate bicyclist accommodations. There are no pavement markings on
Hunter Street. Overgrown brush and vegetation on the northeast corner of the intersection limit the
intersection sight distance.

    B. SITEOBSERVATIONS/POTENTIALFACTORS

The following is a summary of some observations from the field visits:

    ·   Pedestrian pushbuttons are not operating as intended. The pedestrian signal at the northwest
        corner is missing, the pushbuttons at the southwest corner operate the opposite approach than
        designated by placement and signage (e.g. button to cross Bay Street south leg operates Sanford
        Street west leg), and there is no accommodation to cross the Bay Street south leg from the
        southeast corner, since the pedestrian button at the southeast corner controls the Sanford
        Street west leg crossing. See Section 2.0A.
    ·   Visibility of the signals and signage for Photo 5: On Sanford Street at stop line looking westbound
        vehicles at the Sanford Street eastbound and
        westbound approach stop lines is limited due
        to the height and longitudinal placement of
        the signals.

    ·   Visibility of the signal and overhead signage is
        impeded for Sanford Street westbound
        vehicles due to the tree canopy overhanging
        the Sanford Street westbound approach. See
        Photo 7.
    ·   Visibility of southbound vehicles, pedestrians
        and bicyclists on Bay Street is impeded for the
        Hunter Street vehicles due to the northbound
        queue at Sanford Street, on-street parking
        and overgrown bushes at the northwest corner of the Hunter Street and Bay Street intersection.
        See Photos 2 and 6.
    ·   Vehicles use the parking lanes on the Bay Street north and south approaches to overtake the
        leading vehicles waiting to turn left at the intersection.
    ·   The unmarked eastbound and westbound approach lanes are wide enough to allow vehicles to
        overtake other vehicles stopped and turning left on these approaches. As a result, drivers may
        overtake the leading vehicles waiting to travel through or turn left at the intersection. See
        Photo 1 above.

    ·   Bicyclists ride both on the sidewalk and on the roadway.
    ·   Parking within the immediate vicinity of the intersection was not observed during the field visits.
        However, on-street parking provided close to the intersection would impede sight distance. The
        parallel parking maneuvers increases potential for collisions between vehicles parking and those
        following who might need to suddenly stop as well as for those parked vehicles entering traffic
        which may force vehicles to stop abruptly.
    ·   The close spacing of Hunter Street to the Bay Street and Sanford Street intersection and the
        volumes southbound on Bay Street has the potential to increase accidents due to the turning
        maneuvers into and out of this Hunter Street intersection. 


    C. ACCIDENTHISTORY

An accident analysis was performed for the Bay Street and Sanford Street intersection using accident
data provided by the City of Glens Falls Police Department. The analysis includes crashes for a five year
period that occurred from April 24, 2008 through April 24, 2013. Table 1 summarizes the accident
history at the study area intersection. In addition, a detailed accident summary sheet and a collision
diagram are included in Appendix A.

There were 25 accidents at the Bay Street and Sanford Street intersection over the last five years. Based
on the data, 16 of these accidents occurred within the last three year period. There were 9 (36%)
injury, 13 (52%) property damage only, and 3 (12%) non-reportable or unknown accidents. There were
no fatalities.

          Table 1: Types of Collisions
           Type of Collision                        Number                  Percentage
           Rear-End                                   8                        32%
           Right Angle                                9                        36%
           Left Turn                                  2                        8%
           Sideswipe                                  3                        12%
           Overtaking                                 1                         4%
           Pedestrian/Bicyclist                       2                         8%
           Total                                       25                      100%

The data also shows the following:
    · Eighty percent (80%) of the accidents occurred in daylight which suggests that night-time
       visibility is not the primary contributing factor of the crash history.
    · Seventeen accidents (68%) occurred with dry pavement conditions, with the remaining 8
       accidents (32%) occurring with wet (5), snow/ice (2), slush (1) conditions.
    · Five accidents (20%) occurred at the Hunter Street intersection.
    · There was no distinct pattern of the rear-end accidents as 5 occurred at the Bay and Sanford
       Street intersection (2 on each of the northbound and southbound approaches and 1 on the
       westbound approach) and 3 occurred at the Bay Street and Hunter Street intersection (2 on the
       Bay Street southbound and 1 on the northbound approaches).
    · The two bicyclist accidents involved a westbound vehicle from Sanford Street and Hunter Street
       and a southbound bicyclist traveling against traffic.
    · One of the right angle accidents involved alcohol.

                Bay and Sanford Street, Glens Falls, NY: Safety Study                               Page 9
    ·       The predominate type of angle accidents involved eastbound vehicles with either the north- or
            southbound Bay Street vehicles.

The intersection accident rate was calculated and compared to the statewide average for intersections
on state roads with similar geometry and traffic control. The accident rate for the subject intersection
(not including the 5 Hunter Street accidents) is approximately 0.80 accidents per million entering
vehicles (acc/MEV) as compared to the statewide average of 0.34 acc/MEV. It is noted that the
statewide average is calculated for state roadways only and that since the Bay Street and Sanford Street
are county and local roads, respectively, the characteristics may be slightly different. In addition,
accident rates are typically reported for a 3-year rather than a 5-year period.


    D. TRAFFICVOLUMES

The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) Traffic Volume Data Viewer was used to
obtain the Average Annual Daily Traffic Volume (AADT) data for Bay Street and Sanford Street. Table 2
below summarizes the 2010 AADT. Figure 2 below shows hourly volumes approaching the intersection.
See Appendix B for the Traffic Hourly Data Report.

        northbound (NB) and southbound (SB) directions for Bay Street and eastbound (EB) and westbound (WB) directions for Sanford Street.

The Traffic Volume Report provided vehicle classification and speed data for Bay Street for the roadway
segment of Sanford Street to the City Line. NYSDOT used an automatic traffic recorder (ATR) device,
placed just north of Hope Avenue to collect the data.           Vehicle classification data showed that
approximately 4% of the daily traffic on this segment of Bay Street was heavy vehicles, comprised as 3%
traveling north and 5% traveling south. The speed data showed that the 85th percentile speed was 35.9
mph in the north direction and 36.8 mph in the south direction with a 50th percentile speed of
approximately 31.5 mph for each of the directions.

Three signalized intersections exist on Bay Street between Washington Street and Sanford Street (at
Washington Street, Grand Street, Sanford Street). No signalized intersections exist on Bay Street north
of Sanford Street to the City line. North of the City line, there is one midblock crossing, to accommodate
the Warren County Bikeway, and a signalized intersection at NYS Route 254. The data indicates that
motorists travel at a slightly higher 85th percentile speed in the southbound direction than the
northbound direction. This suggests that the motorists are traveling at a slightly higher speed in the
roadway segment where there is uninterrupted flow and a slightly lower speed in the roadway segment
where there is interrupted flow due to the signals. Bay Street is posted 30 mph so the results of the
speed study are consistent with expected 50th and 85th percentile speeds for this posted speed limit and
the character of this area of Bay Street.

Intersection turning movement traffic counts were conducted at the Bay Street and Sanford Street and
Hunter Street intersections on July 30, 2013 during the weekday PM peak period from 4:00 pm to 6:00
pm. Traffic counts were recorded at 15-minute increments. Pedestrian counts were also recorded at
the intersections concurrently with the vehicle counts. The PM peak hour occurred from 4:30 pm to
5:30 pm. See Figure 3 below for the PM peak period volumes. The traffic volumes are included in
Appendix B.

    E. LEVELOFSERVICEANDCAPACITYANALYSIS

Intersection capacity analyses were conducted for the intersection using methodology outlined in the
Highway Capacity Manual 2000 (HCM 2000) published by the Transportation Research Board. Level of
service (LOS) criteria are measured in average delay per vehicle (seconds), and range from LOS A to LOS
F. LOS range from A to F with LOS A considered excellent with very little vehicle delay while level of
service F generally represents conditions with long vehicle delays. Table 3 identifies the levels of service
and associated delay ranges for each type of traffic control.

Capacity analyses were performed for the 2013 Existing PM peak period conditions. Summaries of these
analyses are shown in Table 4. See Appendix B for the LOS analyses. The analyses show that the
intersection operates at overall LOS B with each approach operating at LOS A or B. No geometric
improvements are necessary to accommodate the operations at this intersection.

3.0      IMPROVEMENTINITIATIVES
Based on a review of the existing traffic conditions and accident analysis, several improvements have
been identified as discussed below.

Vegetation
While most of the intersection and surrounding area is open (Photo 1), there are a few locations where
trees and vegetation have become overgrown impairing visibility. At the northeast corner of the Bay
Street and Hunter Street intersection, there is a bush and some overgrown vegetation that limits
visibility (Photo 6) to pedestrians and bicyclists riding on the sidewalk.
Likewise, the trees along the north side of the Sanford Street westbound approach have canopies that
are overhanging the roadway and impacting the view of the traffic signal. The overhead No Right Turn
on Red sign is not visible due to the canopy from these trees (Photo 7). Trees and brush should be
trimmed and removed as necessary to maintain adequate lines of sight.

PedestrianSignals
While the accident data did not indicate a pedestrian/bicycle safety issue, the pedestrian signals are not
functioning according to the intended operation. In addition, the pedestrian signal at the northwest
corner of the intersection is missing due to an accident that occurred in April 2013. As discussed in
Section 2.0B, the pedestrian signals at the southwest and the southeast are not functioning correctly.
The pushbuttons, signs and pedestrian signals at the northeast corner (Photo 8) are functioning
correctly.
Photo 8: Signal Pole at northeast corner




The pushbuttons, signs and pedestrian signals at the southeast and southwest corners should be
corrected so that the buttons activate the correct signals, and the damaged/missing signals at the
northwest corner should be re-installed to accommodate pedestrian crossings through the intersection.
VehicularTrafficSignals
The traffic signals that control the Sanford Street eastbound and westbound approaches exceed the
maximum standard for mounting heights of signal faces, as noted in Section 4D.15 of the MUTCD and
NYS Supplement. In accordance with these documents, vehicular signal faces located over any portion


                  Bay and Sanford Street, Glens Falls, NY: Safety Study                           Page 14
of a highway that can be used by motor vehicles shall be at least 15 feet above the pavement and not
more than 19 feet. All of the existing vehicular signal faces exceed this maximum mounting height with
the signals ranging in height from 19.5 feet to 20.9 feet (from top of pavement to bottom of signal
housing). Since all of the signals exceed the maximum height to the bottom of the signal housing,
several of the signals also exceed the maximum top of signal head mounting height.
Visibility of the signals, given the longitudinal positioning and the mounting height over the pavement,
may be a contributing factor in the accidents at this intersection.
    AdjustSignalHeadPositions
    The signals controlling the westbound approach should be lowered at least 2.5 to 3 feet. The signals
    controlling the eastbound approach should be lowered at least 1.5 to 2 feet. Determination of the
    appropriate method to lower the signal heads, including the use of new signal brackets, lowering the
    mast arm, or installing new signals should be assessed. A detailed engineering evaluation, including
    an assessment of the structural capacity of the supports, impact on utilities, and visibility of the
    signal heads will be necessary prior to implementing this measure. This evaluation could be
    approached by having a structural engineer review and evaluate the design shop drawings of the
    mast arm poles that were installed and/or work with the pole manufacturer to determine the ability
    of the poles to accept loading revisions based on their design load.
                                                                                     Figure 4: Backplate with
    Installbackplates                                                                Retroreflective Border

    Backplates with retroreflective borders is a low cost safety treatment that
    can be added to the existing traffic signal indication. A signal head equipped
    with a backplate with a retroreflective border enhances the visibility of the
    illuminated face of the signals, in both daytime and nighttime conditions,
    which has the potential to reduce unintentional red-light running crashes.
    Prior to implementing this measure, the structural capacity of the supports
    will need to be evaluated.

AccessManagement
Five of the 25 accidents over the 5 year period occurred at the Bay Street and Hunter Street
intersection. Long term, evaluation of permitting only right turns in and right turns out of Hunter Street
and restricting left turn movements could be considered. This evaluation would need to consider the
impact the diverted left turn movements would have to the adjacent intersections.

4.0     CONCLUSION
This report summarizes the results of an accident analysis for the Bay Street and Sanford Street
intersection and identifies several improvements that can be implemented to improve safety and bring
existing vehicular and pedestrian signal in compliance with the MUTCD and NYS Supplement.

Tasks performed for this traffic study included the following:
    1. Review of accident data for a 5-year period to determine the most frequent types of accidents
        and common contributing factors in those accidents.
    2. Collection of traffic data by means of site visit including manual turning movement counts,
        geometric measurements and signal timing and phasing.
    3. Analysis of collected traffic data.
    4. Development of alternatives to improve traffic and safety conditions at this intersection.

An accident analysis was performed for the Bay Street and Sanford Street intersection using accident
data provided by the City of Glens Falls Police Department. The analysis includes crashes over a five
year period that occurred from April 24, 2008 through April 24, 2013. Detailed accident summary sheets
and a collision diagram are included in Appendix A. A summary of the data showed that there were 20
accidents at the Bay Street and Sanford Street intersection and 5 accidents at the Bay Street and Hunter
Street intersection over the last five years. Based on the data, 16 of these accidents occurred within the
last three year period. There were 9 (36%) injury, 13 (52%) property damage only, and 3 (12%) non-
reportable or unknown accidents. There were no fatalities.

Based on the accident analysis, the intersection crash rate is more than two times higher than the
statewide average for similar intersections. The analysis shows that the two primary accident patterns
at the intersection were rear end accidents and angle accidents between the eastbound approach and
either the north- or southbound approaches. Although 32% of the accidents were rear- end accidents,
there was no pattern associated with these types of accidents.

While the accident data did not indicate a pedestrian/bicycle safety issue, the pedestrian signals at the
southwest and southeast corners are not functioning according to the intended operation and the
pedestrian signal at the northwest corner of the intersection is missing due to an accident that occurred
in April 2013. The pushbuttons, signs and pedestrian signals at the southeast and southwest corners
should be corrected and the signal at the northwest corner installed to accommodate pedestrian
crossings through the intersection.
Average Annual Daily Traffic Volume (AADT) data were obtained from the New York State Department
of Transportation (NYSDOT) Traffic Volume Data Viewer and turning movement counts were performed
for the PM peak period (4 pm to 6 pm) on July 30, 2013. Based upon the existing traffic volumes and
capacity analysis, there is sufficient capacity and acceptable operations at this intersection such that no
geometric improvements are necessary. The capacity analyses performed for the 2013 Existing PM peak
period conditions show that the intersection operates at overall LOS B with each approach operating at
LOS A or B. The traffic volume data is included in Appendix B.

Several measures have been identified for the City of Glens Falls' consideration to improve safety at this
intersection including:
    · Removing vegetation along the east side of Bay Street between Hunter Street and Sanford
        Street and trim the trees along the north side of the Sanford Street eastbound approach
        between Stoddard Avenue and Bay Street.
    · Modifying the pedestrian signals at the southwest and southeast corners and install the
        pedestrian signal at the northwest corner.
    · Lower the signal heads to comply with MUTCD standards.
    · Install signal backplates (subject to confirmation of design loads).
    · Providing access management.

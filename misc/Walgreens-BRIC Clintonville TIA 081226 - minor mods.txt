           CHAPTER I ­ INTRODUCTION & EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

PART A ­ PURPOSE OF REPORT AND STUDY OBJECTIVES
MRED-Cummings Commercial Development Corporation is proposing a commercial
development to be located along the east side of Main Street between Madison Street and 3rd
Street in the City of Clintonville, Waupaca County, Wisconsin. This traffic impact analysis
(TIA) has been conducted by Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc. based on a Wisconsin Department
of Transportation (WisDOT) identified scope to determine the expected weekday morning and
weekday evening peak hour operating conditions at the study area intersections.
This report documents the procedures, findings and conclusions of the traffic impact analysis.
The analysis identifies recommended improvements based on existing intersection geometrics,
background traffic volumes, and additional traffic expected to be generated by the on-site
commercial development and identified off-site developments.

PART B ­ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The executive summary includes a description of the study area, description of the development
and conclusions based on the findings of the TIA.

B1. Location of Study Site with Respect to Area Roadway Network
The proposed Walgreen's ­ BRIC development site is situated along the east side of Main Street
on a parcel of land located between Madison Street to the north and 3rd Street to the south. The
conceptual site plan for the development is shown in Exhibit 1-1 at the end of this chapter. As
identified by WisDOT, the study area includes the following intersections:
            Main Street intersection with 5th Street (two-way stop control)
            Main Street intersection with Madison Street (traffic signal control)
            Main Street intersection with 3rd Street (two-way stop control).
The development access locations are discussed in further detail later in this chapter under B5.
Access to Walgreen's ­ BRIC Development.

B2. On-Site Development Description
The proposed development is to consist of a 13,650 square foot (sf) pharmacy with drive-thru
and a 4,500-sf shopping center. The development is planned to be constructed in one phase in
the Year 2009. Note that, other than Year 2009 traffic analyses, no other future year traffic
analysis was conducted since the trip generation of the proposed Walgreen's ­ BRIC
development is relatively low and requires only an abbreviated TIA (i.e. no Year 2019 analysis).

B3. Off-Site Development Description
Madison Street currently intersects Main Street from the west, but the east leg terminates as a
cul-de-sac. The plan is to eliminate the cul-de-sac such that the Main Street intersection with
Madison Street becomes a four-leg intersection. Eliminating the cul-de-sac of Madison Street
will provide a new route for traffic to/from Torborgs Lumber, Klein Auto and residents east on
5th Street to access Main Street. Note that the access along the east side of Main Street between
Madison Street and 5th Street was assumed to be closed and new access provided along Madison
Street.



Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc.                                                                    1
Walgreen's ­ BRIC Development                                             Updated: December 26, 2008


Klein Auto recently eliminated its building immediately west of the Main Street intersection with
5th Street. The current plan is to use the former building area for additional outdoor auto
display/storage.

B4. Site Generated Traffic
Traffic to/from the on-site and off-site developments was estimated utilizing the Institute of
Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, 2003.

On-Site Development
The on-site commercial development is expected to generate approximately 30 new trips (20
entering/10 exiting) during the weekday morning peak hour and 115 trips (55 entering/60
exiting) during the weekday evening peak hour. On a typical weekday (24-hour period), the
commercial development is anticipated to generate approximately 1,150 new trips (575
entering/575 exiting).

Off-Site Development
Outdoor auto display/storage generates little traffic. The additional Klein Auto outdoor auto
display/storage area was assumed to generate 10 trips in and 10 trips out during both the
weekday morning and evening peak hours. Note that, in reality, the additional outdoor auto area
will generate closer to 1 to 2 trips per peak hour. The assumption of 10 trips in and 10 trips out
is an aggressive estimate.

B5. Access to Walgreen's ­ BRIC Development
Three access points are proposed to accommodate the commercial development.
            The "North Access" is proposed as a full access along Madison Street, approximately
            245 feet east of Main Street.
            The "Center Access" is proposed as a right-in/right-out access along Main Street,
            approximately 285 feet south of Madison Street and 205 feet north of 3rd Street.
            The "South Access" is proposed as a full access along 3rd Street, approximately 180
            feet east of Main Street.
The proposal includes eliminating the cul-de-sac and realigning the east leg of Madison Street so
as to intersect it with the existing Main Street T-intersection with Madison Street.
Sidewalks exist along both sides of Madison Street west of Main Street, but not along Madison
Street east of Main Street. Sidewalks also exist along both sides of 3rd Street west of Main
Street, along the north side of 3rd Street east of Main Street, and along both sides of 5th Street east
of Main Street.
A "Bike Route Crossing" sign exists in the median of the south leg of the Main Street
intersection with Madison Street, though documentation could not be found to determine the
bicycle route to which this sign pertains.

B6. Year 2009 Total Traffic Recommended Improvements
The study area intersections were analyzed based on the procedures set forth in the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). Intersection operation is defined by "level of service".
Level of Service (LOS) is a quantitative measure that refers to the overall quality of flow at an
intersection ranging from very good, represented by LOS `A', to very poor, represented by LOS


Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc.                                                                      2
Walgreen's ­ BRIC Development                                             Updated: December 26, 2008


`F'. For the purpose of this study, LOS C was used to define acceptable peak hour operating
conditions. Descriptions of the various levels of service are as follows:
        LOS A is the highest level of service that can be achieved. Under this condition,
        intersection approaches appear quite open, turning movements are easily made, and
        nearly all drivers find freedom of operation.
        LOS B represents stable operation.
        LOS C still represents stable operation, but periodic backups of a few vehicles may
        develop behind turning vehicles. Most drivers begin to feel restricted, but not
        objectionably so.
        LOS D represents increasing traffic restrictions as the intersection approaches instability.
        Delays to approaching vehicles may be substantial during short peaks within the peak
        period, but periodic clearance of long lines occurs, thus preventing excessive backups.
        LOS E represents the capacity of the intersection.
        LOS F represents jammed conditions where the intersection is over capacity and
        acceptable gaps for unsignalized intersections in the mainline traffic flow are minimal.
To accommodate the Year 2009 total traffic volumes, which include the full build completion of
the proposed Walgreen's ­ BRIC development, the following improvements are recommended.
The improvements are illustrated in Exhibit 1-2. Improvements are for WisDOT and City
consideration. WisDOT reserves the right to determine alternative improvements.
        Main Street intersection with 5th Street
                No improvements are recommended.
        Main Street intersection with Madison Street
                Open and align the east leg of Madison Street to Main Street, resulting in a four-
                leg intersection. Provide an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared through/right-
                turn lane on the new Madison Street westbound approach to the intersection.
                Revise the pavement marking and signing on the Madison Street eastbound
                approach to include an exclusive left-turn lane, a through lane, and an exclusive
                right-turn lane. Stripe off the existing outside right-turn lane, as the intersection
                will operate more efficiently with a single right-turn lane than dual right-turn
                lanes. The reason for this increase in efficiency is dual right-turn lanes would
                only be given a green arrow during a northbound left-turn phase then have a red
                ball whereas a single right-turn lane will be given a longer lasting green ball.
                Provide an exclusive left-turn lane on the Main Street southbound approach.
                The analysis assumes the Main Street northbound approach will continue to have
                an exclusive left-turn lane and two through lanes, with the outside through lane
                shared with right-turn traffic. That is, a dedicated right-turn lane need not be
                provided on the Main Street northbound approach.
                Maintain traffic signal control at the intersection. Revise the sequence of
                operations to accommodate a new pedestrian crossing of the east leg to the
                intersection. With the Madison Street eastbound right-turn movement converted
                to a single right-turn lane, the existing right-turn traffic signals should be removed
                or replaced with permitted-overlap right-turn traffic signals.

        Main Street intersection with Center Access (proposed)
                Restrict the center access to right-in/right-out only.
                Install a stop sign on the center access approach to Main Street.
        Main Street intersection with 3rd Street
                No improvements are recommended.
        Madison Street intersection with North Access (proposed)
                Shared lanes can be provided on all approaches to the intersection.
                It is anticipated that access to the east side of Main Street between Madison Street
                and 5th Street will be closed, and access provided to Madison Street.
                Consideration should be given to aligning Torborgs Lumber/Klein Auto access to
                the Walgreen's ­ BRIC development north access.
                Install stop signs to control access approaches to Madison Street.
        3rd Street intersection with South Access (proposed)
                Shared lanes can be provided on all approaches to the intersection.
                Install a stop sign to control the south access approach to 3rd Street.
        Other Considerations
                The pedestrian environment along Main Street was observed to be well utilized
                during the data collection portion of the TIA. It is recommended to provide
                pedestrian facilities on Madison Street along the Walgreen's ­ BRIC development
                north boundary, as well as to provide pedestrian connections from the street
                system to the development buildings.

B7. Conclusion
All movements at the study area intersections are expected to operate at LOS C or better
conditions with the proposed Walgreen's ­ BRIC development and the recommended
improvements.

                     CHAPTER II ­ PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

PART A ­ ON-SITE DEVELOPMENT
A1. Development Description and Site Location
 The proposed Walgreen's ­ BRIC development site is situated along the east side of Main Street
on a parcel of land located between Madison Street to the north and 3rd Street to the south.
Exhibit 2-1 shows the approximate site location for the proposed development in relation to the
surrounding roadway network.

A2. Land Use and Intensity
The proposed development is to consist of a 13,650 square foot (sf) pharmacy with drive-thru
and a 4,500-sf shopping center. The development is planned to be constructed in one phase in
the Year 2009. A copy of the conceptual site plan is shown in Exhibit 2-2.

A3. Site Plan
Three access points are proposed to accommodate the commercial development.
            The "North Access" is proposed as a full access along Madison Street, approximately
            245 feet east of Main Street.
            The "Center Access" is proposed as a right-in/right-out access along Main Street,
            approximately 285 feet south of Madison Street and 205 feet north of 3rd Street.
            The "South Access" is proposed as a full access along 3rd Street, approximately 180
            feet east of Main Street.
The proposal includes eliminating the cul-de-sac and realigning the east leg of Madison Street so
as to intersect it with the existing Main Street T-intersection with Madison Street.

A4. Development Phasing and Timing
The commercial development is to be constructed under one phase in the Year 2009.
PART B ­ STUDY AREA

B1. Influence Area
The proposed development is expected to draw trips locally rather than regionally. The areas of
significant influence include the City of Clintonville and its bordering communities.

B2. Area of Significant Traffic Impact
As identified by WisDOT, the study area includes the following intersections:
            Main Street intersection with 5th Street (two-way stop control)
            Main Street intersection with Madison Street (traffic signal control)
            Main Street intersection with 3rd Street (two-way stop control).

PART C ­ OFF-SITE LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT
Madison Street currently intersects Main Street from the west, but the east leg terminates as a
cul-de-sac. The plan is to eliminate the cul-de-sac such that the Main Street intersection with
Madison Street becomes a four-leg intersection. Eliminating the cul-de-sac of Madison Street

will provide a new route for traffic to/from Torborgs Lumber, Klein Auto and residents east on
5th Street to access Main Street. Note that the access along the east side of Main Street between
Madison Street and 5th Street was assumed to be closed and new access provided along Madison
Street.
Klein Auto recently eliminated its building immediately west of the Main Street intersection with
5th Street. The current plan is to use the former building area for additional outdoor auto
display/storage.

PART D ­ SITE ACCESSIBILITY
D1. Study Area Roadways
Main Street is a two-lane undivided north/south urban arterial highway with on-street parking
north of 5th Street, a four-lane divided north/south roadway from 5th Avenue to just north of 3rd
Street, and a four-lane undivided north/south roadway south of 3rd Street. The posted speed limit
along Main Street is 25 miles per hour (mph). According to WisDOT, the Year 2003 annual
average daily traffic (AADT) volumes on Main Street were 21,000 vehicles per day (vpd) north
of Madison Street and 12,900-vpd south of 3rd Street. Main Street is also designated as State
Trunk Highway (STH) 22 north of Madison Street and United States Highway (USH) 45/STH 22
south of Madison Street.
Madison Street is a four-lane divided east/west arterial highway with a posted speed limit of 35
mph west of Main Street, and a two-lane undivided east/west local roadway without a posted
speed limit east of Main Street. The assumed speed limit along Madison Street east of Main
Street is 25-mph due to the nature of the roadway design and local land use. The east leg of
Madison Street terminates as a cul-de-sac just prior to Main Street. According to WisDOT, the
Year 2006 AADT volume on Madison Street was approximately 4,900 vpd west of Main Street.
Madison Street is also designated as USH 45 west of Main Street.
3rd Street is a two-lane undivided east/west roadway without a posted speed limit. The assumed
speed limit along 3rd Street is 25-mph due to the nature of the roadway design and local land use.
AADT volumes are not currently documented by WisDOT for 3rd Street.
5th Street is a two-lane undivided east/west roadway without a posted speed limit. The assumed
speed limit along 5th Street is 25-mph due to the nature of the roadway design and local land
use. AADT volumes are not currently documented by WisDOT for 5th Street.

D2. Existing Alternative Modes of Transportation
Sidewalks exist along both sides of Madison Street west of Main Street, but not along Madison
Street east of Main Street. Sidewalks also exist along both sides of 3rd Street west of Main
Street, along the north side of 3rd Street east of Main Street, and along both sides of 5th Street east
of Main Street.
A "Bike Route Crossing" sign exists in the median of the south leg of the Main Street
intersection with Madison Street, though documentation could not be found to determine the
bicycle route to which this sign pertains.

            CHAPTER III ­ ANALYSIS OF EXISTING CONDITIONS

PART A ­ PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Exhibit 3-1a shows the existing transportation detail for the study area intersections and
roadways. Exhibit 3-1b graphically illustrates existing intersection geometrics, posted speed
limits, and the approximate turn-bay lengths at intersections within the study area.

PART B ­ TRAFFIC VOLUMES
Weekday morning and weekday evening peak hour turning movement counts were conducted by
Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc. in April 2008 at the Main Street intersection with Madison Street
and the Main Street intersection with 3rd Street, and were conducted in September 2008 at the
Main Street intersection with 5th Street. Based on the turning movement counts, the weekday
morning and weekday evening peak hours were identified as being 7:30 to 8:30 and 3:15 to 4:15,
respectively. The traffic counts used to determine peak hour factors and truck percents have
been included in Appendix A of this study.
Traffic forecasts were estimated by Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc. based on a 2-percent annual
growth rate over the Year 2008 existing traffic volumes. The Year 2009 background traffic (no
development) is shown in Exhibit 3-2 at the end of this chapter.

PART C ­ CAPACITY LEVEL OF SERVICE
C1. Level of Service Definitions
The study area intersections were analyzed based on the procedures set forth in the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). Intersection operation is defined by "level of service".
Level of service (LOS) is a quantitative measure that refers to the overall quality of flow at an
intersection ranging from very good, represented by LOS `A', to very poor, represented by LOS
`F'. For the purpose of this study, LOS C was used to define acceptable peak hour operating
conditions. Descriptions of the various levels of service are as follows:
        LOS A is the highest level of service that can be achieved. Under this condition,
        intersection approaches appear quite open, turning movements are easily made, and
        nearly all drivers find freedom of operation. At signalized and unsignalized intersections,
        average delays are less than 10 seconds.
        LOS B represents stable operation. At signalized intersections, average vehicle delays
        are 10 to 20 seconds. At unsignalized intersections, average delays are 10 to 15 seconds.
        LOS C still represents stable operation, but periodic backups of a few vehicles may
        develop behind turning vehicles. Most drivers begin to feel restricted, but not
        objectionably so. At signalized intersections, average vehicle delays are 20 to 35
        seconds. At unsignalized intersections, average delays are 15 to 25 seconds.
        LOS D represents increasing traffic restrictions as the intersection approaches instability.
        Delays to approaching vehicles may be substantial during short peaks within the peak
        period, but periodic clearance of long lines occurs, thus preventing excessive backups.
        At signalized intersections, average vehicle delays are 35 to 55 seconds. At unsignalized
        intersections, average delays are 25 to 35 seconds.
        LOS E represents the capacity of the intersection. At signalized intersections, average
        vehicle delays are 55 to 80 seconds. At unsignalized intersections, average delays are 35
        to 50 seconds.

Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc.                                                                     7
Walgreen's ­ BRIC Development                                          Updated: December 26, 2008


        LOS F represents jammed conditions where the intersection is over capacity and
        acceptable gaps for unsignalized intersections in the mainline traffic flow are minimal.
        At signalized intersections, average vehicle delays exceed 80 seconds. At unsignalized
        intersections, average delays exceed 50 seconds.

C2. Year 2009 Background Traffic Operating Conditions ­ No Improvements
Exhibit 3-3 shows the Year 2009 background traffic (no development) peak hour operating
conditions at the study area intersections. The existing geometrics, shown in Exhibit 3-1b, were
used in the analysis.
As shown in Exhibit 3-3, all movements at the study area intersections are anticipated to operate
acceptably at LOS C or better conditions under Year 2009 background traffic volumes (no
development).

Walgreen's ­ BRIC Development                                          Updated: December 26, 2008


                         CHAPTER IV ­ PROJECTED TRAFFIC

PART A ­ BACKGROUND TRAFFIC FORECASTING
As mentioned in Chapter III ­ Analysis of Existing Conditions, traffic forecasts were estimated
by Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc. based on a 2-percent annual growth rate over the Year 2008
existing traffic volumes. The Year 2009 background traffic (no development) is shown in
Exhibit 3-2 at the end of the previous chapter.
No other future year background traffic analysis was conducted, as the trip generation of the
proposed Walgreen's ­ BRIC development is relatively low and requires only an abbreviated
TIA (i.e. no Year 2019 analysis). Exhibit 4-1, typically reserved to illustrate Year 2019
background traffic, was intentionally omitted from this study.

PART B ­ DEVELOPMENT TRAFFIC FORECASTING
B1. Trip Generation
To address any potential future traffic impacts along study area roadways and at the intersections
adjacent to the development, it is necessary to identify the hourly and daily volume of traffic
generated by the proposed development. The traffic volumes expected to be generated by the
development are based on the size and type of proposed land uses, and on trip rates as published
in the Institute of Transportation Engineer's (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, 2003.

On-Site Development
As shown in Exhibit 4-2, the on-site commercial development is expected to generate
approximately 30 new trips (20 entering/10 exiting) during the weekday morning peak hour and
115 trips (55 entering/60 exiting) during the weekday evening peak hour. On a typical weekday
(24-hour period), the commercial development is anticipated to generate approximately 1,150
new trips (575 entering/575 exiting).
Off-Site Development
Outdoor auto display/storage generates little traffic. The additional Klein Auto outdoor auto
display/storage area was assumed to generate 10 trips in and 10 trips out during both the
weekday morning and evening peak hours. Note that, in reality, the additional outdoor auto area
will generate closer to 1 to 2 trips per peak hour. The assumption of 10 trips in and 10 trips out
is an aggressive estimate.

B2. Mode Split
All trips to/from the commercial development and off-site development were assumed to be via
motor vehicle, though trips may occur via pedestrian and bicycle modes.

B3. Determination of Pass-by and Linked Trip Traffic
Pass-by trips occur when motorists currently on a highway stop off at a development site prior to
continuing on are their intended route (e.g. a motorist northbound on Main Street stops at the
pharmacy prior to continuing northbound on Main Street). Pass-by trips for the Walgreen's ­
BRIC development, which are expected to constitute 20-percent of the total trips, are shown in
Exhibit 4-3.
Linked trips occur when motorists visit more than one land use within a site without leaving the
site (i.e. a pharmacy patron visits the shopping center to its south without reentering the roadway


Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc.                                                                   9

network). Negligible linked trips are assumed to occur and, therefore, Exhibit 4-4 has been
intentionally omitted from this study.

B4. Trip Distribution
The trip distribution for the on-site and off-site developments was determined based on existing
traffic patterns (Analogy Method) and the location of regionally populated areas both inside and
outside the City of Clintonville (Gravity Model Method). The trip distribution is summarized
below and shown in Exhibit 4-5a.
     40 percent to/from the north on Main Street
     40 percent to/from the south on Main Street
     20 percent to/from the west on Madison Street.
B5. Trip Assignment
To determine additional turning movement traffic at the study area intersections, trips generated
by the commercial development and the off-site development were assigned to the adjacent
roadway system based on the directional distributions shown in Exhibit 4-5a.
        The Walgreen's ­ BRIC new trips (Exhibit 4-5b) were added to the development pass-by
        trips (Exhibit 4-3) to identify the Walgreen's ­ BRIC driveway trips shown in Exhibit 4-
        5c.
        The trip diversion due to the Madison Street connection is shown in Exhibit 4-5d.
        The additional Klein Auto development new trips are shown in Exhibit 4-5e.

PART C ­ TOTAL TRAFFIC
The Year 2009 total traffic turning movement volumes were determined by adding the Year
2009 background traffic volumes (Exhibit 3-2) to the commercial development driveway trips
(Exhibit 4-5c), the trip diversion traffic (Exhibit 4-5d), and the additional Klein Auto

Walgreen's ­ BRIC Development                                             Updated: December 26, 2008


           CHAPTER V ­ TRAFFIC AND IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS

PART A ­ SITE ACCESS
As mentioned previously in this TIA, three access points are proposed to accommodate the
commercial development.
            The "North Access" is proposed as a full access along Madison Street, approximately
            245 feet east of Main Street.
            The "Center Access" is proposed as a right-in/right-out access along Main Street,
            approximately 285 feet south of Madison Street and 205 feet north of 3rd Street.
            The "South Access" is proposed as a full access along 3rd Street, approximately 180
            feet east of Main Street.
Madison Street currently intersects Main Street from the west, but the east leg terminates as a
cul-de-sac. The plan is to eliminate the cul-de-sac such that the Main Street intersection with
Madison Street becomes a four-leg intersection. Eliminating the cul-de-sac of Madison Street
will provide a new route for traffic to/from Torborgs Lumber, Klein Auto and residents east on
5th Street to access Main Street. Note that the access along the east side of Main Street between
Madison Street and 5th Street was assumed to be closed and new access provided along Madison
Street.
Sidewalks exist along both sides of Madison Street west of Main Street, but not along Madison
Street east of Main Street. Sidewalks also exist along both sides of 3rd Street west of Main
Street, along the north side of 3rd Street east of Main Street, and along both sides of 5th Street east
of Main Street.
A "Bike Route Crossing" sign exists in the median of the south leg of the Main Street
intersection with Madison Street, though documentation could not be found to determine the
bicycle route to which this sign pertains.

PART B ­ CAPACITY / LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
B1. Year 2019 Background Traffic Operating Conditions ­ No Improvements
A Year 2019 background traffic was not analyzed for this study. Therefore, the Year 2019
background traffic operating conditions typically shown in Exhibit 5-1 have been intentionally
omitted from this study.

B2. Year 2009 Build Traffic ­ No Improvements
The Year 2009 build traffic was not analyzed for this study. Therefore, the Year 2009 build
traffic operating conditions typically shown in Exhibit 5-2 have been intentionally omitted from
this study.

B3. Year 2019 Build Traffic ­ No Improvements
The Year 2019 build traffic was not analyzed for this study. Therefore, the Year 2019 build
traffic operating conditions typically shown in Exhibit 5-3 have been intentionally omitted from
this study.

B4. Year 2009 Total Traffic ­ No Improvements
The Year 2009 total traffic volumes include full build-out of the commercial development, the
Madison Street east connection and the inclusion of the off-site developments. As shown in
Exhibit 5-4, all movements at the study area intersections are anticipated to operate acceptably at
LOS C or better conditions with anticipated improvements. Reference Chapter VI ­
Recommendations & Conclusion for an outline of the improvements assumed in the analysis.

B5. Year 2019 Total Traffic ­ No Improvements
Year 2019 total traffic was not analyzed for this study. Therefore, the Year 2019 total traffic
operating conditions typically shown in Exhibit 5-5 have been intentionally omitted from this
study.

B6. Year 2009 & Year 2019 Traffic ­ With Improvements
No additional improvements are anticipated to be necessary at the study area intersections other
than the improvements assumed in the Year 2009 total traffic "no improvements" analysis.
Exhibits 5-6 through 5-11, reserved to illustrate operations with additional improvements to
obtain LOS C or better conditions, have been intentionally omitted from this study. Reference
Chapter VI ­ Recommendations & Conclusion for an outline of the improvements assumed in the
Year 2009 total traffic analysis.

PART C ­ QUEUEING ANALYSIS
To estimate storage length requirements for turn bays at the study area intersections, a queuing
analysis has been conducted. Note that the 95th percentile probable queue lengths were used for
the design of turn bays at traffic signal and stop sign controlled intersections. These queues were
obtained from SYNCHRO computer software output. The following is a list of where the results
of the queuing analysis can be found.

            Year 2009 total traffic ­ Exhibit 5-13

PART D ­ PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE AND MULTI-USE TRAIL CONSIDERATIONS
The pedestrian environment along Main Street was observed to be well utilized during the data
collection portion of the TIA. It is recommended to provide pedestrian facilities on Madison
Street along the Walgreen's ­ BRIC development north boundary, as well as to provide
pedestrian connections from the street system to the development buildings.

         CHAPTER VI ­ RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION

PART A ­ RECOMMENDATIONS
To accommodate the Year 2009 total traffic volumes, which include the full build completion of
the proposed Walgreen's ­ BRIC development, the following improvements are recommended.
Improvements are for WisDOT and City consideration. WisDOT reserves the right to determine
alternative improvements.
        Main Street intersection with 5th Street
                No improvements are recommended.
        Main Street intersection with Madison Street
                Open and align the east leg of Madison Street to Main Street, resulting in a four-
                leg intersection. Provide an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared through/right-
                turn lane on the new Madison Street westbound approach to the intersection.
                Revise the pavement marking and signing on the Madison Street eastbound
                approach to include an exclusive left-turn lane, a through lane, and an exclusive
                right-turn lane. Stripe off the existing outside right-turn lane, as the intersection
                will operate more efficiently with a single right-turn lane than dual right-turn
                lanes. The reason for this increase in efficiency is dual right-turn lanes would
                only be given a green arrow during a northbound left-turn phase then have a red
                ball whereas a single right-turn lane will be given a longer lasting green ball.
                Provide an exclusive left-turn lane on the Main Street southbound approach.
                The analysis assumes the Main Street northbound approach will continue to have
                an exclusive left-turn lane and two through lanes, with the outside through lane
                shared with right-turn traffic. That is, a dedicated right-turn lane need not be
                provided on the Main Street northbound approach.
                Maintain traffic signal control at the intersection. Revise the sequence of
                operations to accommodate a new pedestrian crossing of the east leg to the
                intersection. With the Madison Street eastbound right-turn movement converted
                to a single right-turn lane, the existing right-turn traffic signals should be removed
                or replaced with permitted-overlap right-turn traffic signals.
        Main Street intersection with Center Access (proposed)
                Restrict the center access to right-in/right-out only.
                Install a stop sign on the center access approach to Main Street.
        Main Street intersection with 3rd Street
                No improvements are recommended.
        Madison Street intersection with North Access (proposed)
                Shared lanes can be provided on all approaches to the intersection.
                It is anticipated that access to the east side of Main Street between Madison Street
                and 5th Street will be closed, and access provided to Madison Street.

Walgreen's ­ BRIC Development                                             Updated: December 26, 2008


                Consideration should be given to aligning Torborgs Lumber/Klein Auto access to
                the Walgreen's ­ BRIC development north access.
                Install stop signs to control access approaches to Madison Street.
        3rd Street intersection with South Access (proposed)
                Shared lanes can be provided on all approaches to the intersection.
                Install a stop sign to control the south access approach to 3rd Street.
        Other Considerations
                The pedestrian environment along Main Street was observed to be well utilized
                during the data collection portion of the TIA. It is recommended to provide
                pedestrian facilities on Madison Street along the Walgreen's ­ BRIC development
                north boundary, as well as to provide pedestrian connections from the street
                system to the development buildings.

PART B ­ CONCLUSION
All movements at the study area intersections are expected to operate at LOS C or better
conditions with the proposed Walgreen's ­ BRIC development and the recommended
improvements.

  Subject: CSAH 11 Traffic Technical Memorandum




Background & Overview

         The objective of this technical memorandum is to document and summarize the traffic analysis
         that was completed for the CSAH 11 Corridor Study. This technical memorandum documents
         the site review, data collection, crash analysis, existing traffic, future traffic volumes, and need
         for signalization. As the study progresses, this information will be used to assist the development
         of recommendations and next steps.

Eagle View Elementary School Site Review

         A key site served by the CSAH 11 corridor is the Eagle View Elementary School located midway
         between Pequot Lakes and Breezy Point on the south side of the roadway. The School was
         constructed seven years ago and has had site circulation issues ever since the School opened.
         Some minor improvements have been made onsite but further improvements are needed to better
         manage the traffic.

         There are currently three access points to the School. The eastern access currently serves bus
         traffic both before and after school. The center primary access accommodates both entering and
         exiting vehicles and can operate efficiently during heavily traveled peak periods due to the use
         and availability of both left and thru-right turn lanes. The western access provides access to only
         vehicles entering the elementary school site, primarily eastbound traffic. During peak school
         hours (7:30 ­ 8:30 AM and 2:45 ­ 3:45 PM) vehicles line up from the entrance doors of the
         School, through the aisles of the parking lot, and sometimes into the turn lanes on CSAH 11.
         While westbound left turns are not currently promoted at the intersection, police would like to see
         restrictions placed on this movement.

         The School recently started construction to expand the current School to include an early
         childhood center as well as to improve site circulation. The addition to the School is on the east
         end of the current building and will therefore promote visitors to utilize the east-most CSAH 11
         access. To better accommodate the additional traffic generated by the new center, a parking lot
         will be constructed to provide parking for standard vehicles in addition to bus traffic utilizing the
         access.

          The Evergreen Business Park is located on the north side of CSAH 11 and aligns its access with
          the primary access to Eagle View Elementary School. The business park is a fairly new edition to
          the CSAH 11 corridor and currently presents an opportunity for future growth.

Data Collection
In order to determine how traffic is currently operating in the study area, a traffic operations analysis was
completed for existing conditions at several key intersections and roadway segments within the study
area. Turning movement volumes, Annual Daily Traffic volumes (ADT), and Annual Average Daily
Traffic volumes (AADT) were collected from field studies, prior transportation studies, and information
from the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT).
Traffic data collection efforts occurred between the dates of September 15, 2011 and September 21, 2011
for AM (7:30- 8:30 a.m.), Afternoon (2:45- 3:45 p.m.) and PM (4:00 ­ 5:00 p.m.) peak periods at the
following key intersections:
      1. CSAH 11 at Eagle View Elementary School
      2. CSAH 11 at Ranchette Drive
      3. CSAH 11 / Breezy Point Access at CSAH 11 / CSAH 4
The raw peak hour turning movement counts can be found in Figure 1.
In conjunction with the turning movement counts listed above, ADT counts were performed at four
locations near Eagle View Elementary School. These locations were chosen to gain a deeper
understanding of the average traffic volumes utilizing the School accesses and CSAH 11 on a daily basis.
An Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) Report developed Short Elliott Hendrickson (SEH) Inc. in
October 2008 documents the existing and future traffic volumes present at various intersections along TH
371. For the purpose of this document, the information provided on the intersection of TH 371 and
CSAH 11was used as a point of reference for both the existing volumes at the current intersection as well
as the proposed intersection that will be created with the State Highway 371 Bypass Alignment.

Crash Analysis
This crash analysis included an evaluation of the Minnesota Department of Transportation's (Mn/DOT)1
crash data for the years 2006 through 2010. This data is used to document crash locations, patterns, and
trends by evaluating the number, type, and severity of crashes that occurred at key intersections and
roadway segments within the study area.
The overall CSAH 11 corridor presents a moderately safe driving environment with a limited amount of
crashes, 34, over a five year period for a segment of roadway approaching five miles in length. See Table
2 & 3 in Appendix A. In order to gain a better understanding of the safety of the corridor, it is often
beneficial to break down the corridor and isolate specific areas of interest within the project area.
Conditions at various intersections and segments are described in detail below:
TH 371 at CSAH 11 has a crash rate of 0.29 crashes per million entering vehicles (MEV) which is lower
than the District 3 average crash rate of 0.7 and statewide average crash rate of 0.4 crashes per MEV for
signalized intersections. The severity of crashes occurring at this intersection including six resulting in

property damage, only two possible injury, and one non-incapacitating injury. See Table 2 & 3 in
Appendix A for more details.
CSAH 11 at Eagle View Elementary School accesses have not experienced a crash during the study years
of 2006 ­ 2010. While deer collisions have occurred during this time period at locations near the School,
none occurred at or can be attributed to any of the three School accesses. See Table 2 & 3 in Appendix A
for more details.
CSAH 11 East of Ski Chalet Drive contains a small segment of roadway on a large horizontal curve that
has produced four crashes in the past five years. Of the four crashes, one involved property damage, one
involved a possible injury, and two resulted in non-incapacitating injuries. See Table 2 & 3 in Appendix
A for more details.
CSAH 11 at Ranchette Drive has a crash rate of 0.16 which is near the average rate of 0.20 present at two-
way stop control intersection in the District 3 and is well below the statewide average of 0.5. The two
crashes that occurred at the intersection between 2006 - 2010 were minor in severity with one resulting in
a possible injury and the other resulting in property damage. See Table 2 & 3 in Appendix A for more
details.
CSAH 11 at CSAH 4/ CSAH 11 has a crash rate of 0.28 which is near the average rate of 0.30 present at
all-way stop control intersection in District 3 and is well below the statewide average of 0.4. The two
crashes that occurred at the intersection between 2006 - 2010 were minor in severity with both crashes
resulting in property damage only to the involved parties. See Table 2 & 3 in Appendix A for more
details.

Existing Traffic Volumes

The existing traffic volumes presented within this document are a collaboration of collected field data and
information available by the Minnesota Department of Transportation. While AM and PM peak hour
counts were completed at multiple intersections throughout the CSAH 11 corridor, the main form of
analysis will be performed with the collected average daily traffic (ADT) and the attained annual average
daily traffic (AADT) counts. To estimate CSAH 11 cross streets ADT volumes, it was necessary to
calculate the percentage of traffic occupying the peak hour compared to the daily traffic. In calculating
this value, the k-factor, it was determined that 9.6% of daily traffic utilizes the roadways during the peak
hour. This percentage was then used to estimate the daily cross street volumes by dividing peak hour
volumes by 0.096 to attain an estimate of the daily traffic.

The values were then modified using Table 3: Month and Day Adjustment Factors from the 2003
Highway 371 North Improvement Project report to attain the seasonal adjustment 1.02 for the field counts
performed in September 2011. The seasonal adjustment factor is recommended for use on the existing
CSAH 11 mainline volumes to ensure each data point utilized within the trend line has been collected or
developed in the same manner. The purpose of these corrections is to ensure that final values are
independent of elevated seasonal traffic volumes and provide an accurate assessment of future conditions
on the CSAH 11 corridor.

Future Traffic Volumes

The initial step in developing 2030 study area traffic volumes requires the determination of background
growth of existing traffic on the CSAH 11 corridor. To develop accurate values, both historic ADT
volumes and Crow Wing County growth rates were analyzed. ADT volumes for CSAH 11 were attained
to develop a trend line used to estimate 2030 traffic volumes. Table 4, shown below, displays the ADT
volumes developed using each of the described methods. After analyzing the values generated by both

methods, the chosen value was based upon the developed historic trend line excluding the outlier AADT
in the year 2005. CSAH 4 AADT volumes were developed using similar methodology and attaining a
trend line to predict 2030 traffic volumes.

While main line traffic volumes were developed through the use of historic AADT volumes and verified
with county growth rates, intersecting roadway volumes were developed using trip generation estimates
from the Eighth Edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual. For the purpose of this document, the
generated daily traffic volumes were isolated to the crossing minor streets and were not distributed
throughout the CSAH 11 network. CSAH 11 2030 traffic volumes were grown based off growth factors
described in previous paragraphs and therefore do not require the distribution of generated cross street
volumes. The methodology assumed within the ITE Trip Generation Manual estimates traffic volumes
from the number of housing units, business square footages, and a variety of other factors investigated
and deemed viable in prior research by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The trip generation
volumes for the Pine River State Bank and future convenience store with gas pumps were modified to
account for diverted link trips. These modifications can be seen in Appendix A where a percentage of the
total volume is removed from the identified land uses due to commuters stopping by the establishments
on their way to or from their homes or other described businesses.

Due to the large parcel size, land coverage by business was reviewed. It was determined from current
parcel development that 6% of developed parcels are occupied by a business footprint. This value was
then translated to estimate building square footage of the remaining available parcels in the Evergreen
Business Park. Table 5 displays the daily traffic volumes generated by current and future land uses. The
daily volumes and land uses are organized by study intersection and proximity to CSAH 11.

Information was also referenced from a 2008 Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) developed by SEH.
The report accounts for the planned construction of the TH 371 bypass and the implications on traffic that
occurs. The 2030 ADT volumes produced by SEH, Inc. were developed using sound engineering
methodology and will therefore be utilized within this document. As described in Appendix A of the ICE
report, 2010 and 2030 daily traffic volumes were developed in the following way:

      Estimate turning movement volumes for intersections along TH 371.
      Determine forecast year annual growth rates for study intersections.
      Apply annual growth rates to existing turning movement counts.
      Convert weekday forecast year turning movement volumes for study intersections into 24-hour
      traffic volumes based on existing 2002 24-hour traffic volumes.
      Convert weekday forecast year turning movement volumes for study intersections into forecast
      year ADTs.
      Traffic forecasts were then evaluated for reasonableness.


To ensure that attained traffic volumes are representative of the current and future conditions found on the
CSAH 11 corridor, it is necessary to apply a seasonal adjustment factor that will better estimate the yearly
traffic volumes as a whole. Table 3 from SEH Traffic Report ­ Draft EIS Phase, Highway 371 North
Improvement Project produces seasonal adjustment factors based off Automatic Traffic Recorders (ATR)

H:\CWCO\T42103934\docs\Traffic Memo\Traffic Memo (11-8-11).doc

volumes located on US 10 in Benton County and TH 371 in Cass County. This table is shown in Table 6
below:

Table 6: Seasonal Adjustment Factors




Traffic Report ­ Draft EIS Phase, Highway 371 North Improvement Project (SEH)

The initial adjustment factors utilized within the estimation of future traffic volumes was done so to adjust
2030 traffic volumes generated for the month of June by SEH in the Draft EIS Phase document. A June
weekday adjustment factor of 1.10 was used to reduce 2030 traffic projections at the intersection of TH
371 and CSAH 11 to represent average daily traffic volumes unaffected by seasonal traffic fluctuations.
A seasonal adjustment factor of 1.02 was also used to reduce traffic volumes of field data collected during
weekdays in September. The final 2030 traffic volumes can be found in windows positioned near the top
of the map area in Figure 2.

TH 371 Bypass

In 2008, the city of Breezy Point counted traffic on Buschmann Road. The average annual daily traffic
(AADT) was estimated to be approximately 800 vehicles at that time. The city worked with the County
to determine an upgraded roadway in the future (2030) that should be expected to carry 1,500 vehicles per
day. The ADTs projected on CSAH 11with the proposed TH 371 bypass are expected to be in the range
of 8,600 to 12,400 vehicles per day. Based on methodology from the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM),
the daily capacity of a rural 2-lane 55 mph roadway is approximately 12,000 vehicles per day. If the
volume threshold of 12,000 is breached on CSAH 11, it would be in the best interest of the stakeholders
to analyze both Buschmann Road and CSAH 11 when looking to increase capacity on the east-west
roadways. If the improvements described within the Subarea Study ­ Ackerson Road / Buschmann Road
Corridor are performed, the ability of the roadway to handle more vehicles may provide the additional
capacity needed to alleviate future issues involving vehicle delay and driver safety. Both roadways
should be monitored going forward to ensure the capabilities of each are best utilized when establishing a
plan of action should CSAH 11 exceed its existing capacity.

Signal Warrants

Major intersections identified along the CSAH 11 corridor were analyzed at a planning level to determine
which, if any, may require future traffic control mitigation. While these estimates do not directly indicate
whether a signal will be necessary, it identifies those intersections that should be monitored. As a means
to proactively address potential future intersection safety issues, forecasted vehicles per day (vpd)
entering intersections currently controlled by a thru-stop or all-way stop condition were reviewed.

            Page 7


Intersections with forecasted intersecting daily volumes that met or exceeded the following thresholds
were identified.
     6,000 vpd on the major approach and 3,000 vpd on the minor approach or
     9,000 vpd on the major approach and 1,500 vpd on the minor approach

Existing and 2030 traffic volumes produced through the use of existing and historic traffic volumes,
background growth, trip generation, and seasonal adjustment factors can now be analyzed using the
previously described methodology to determine whether further traffic control may be needed at the
following study intersections :

TH 371 at CSAH 11 (Bypass Alignment):
The need for signalization at the intersection of TH 371 at CSAH 11 with the bypass alignment was
investigated within the Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) Phase I Report developed by SEH. As
displayed within Table 1 and Table 2 of that document, the intersection meets multiple signal warrants for
projected 2010 and 2030 traffic volumes.

CSAH 11 at School / Evergreen Business Park Accesses:
Existing traffic volumes displayed in Figure 2 indicate that current intersection geometries and traffic
control are acceptable at each access point. Both the eastern and western elementary school/ business
park accesses were included in the 2030 analysis utilizing the proposed design geometry. As shown in
Table 7, the western elementary school / business park access narrowly exceeds the traffic signal
threshold. This indicates that while the eastern access is far below threshold traffic volumes, the western
access should be monitored for future safety concerns.

CSAH 11 at Ranchette Drive:

The substantial growth occurring in the north leg of Ranchette Drive is due to the combination of the
background growth of existing trips, redistribution of current trips to and from the ice arena, and the
future development of a hotel, convenience store, and ice arena expansion. Table 5 indicates that with the
increase in CSAH 11 mainline and Ranchette Drive traffic volumes, it will be necessary to monitor the
efficiency and safety of the intersection with the projected growth.

CSAH 11 at CSAH 4:
The intersection of CSAH 11 at CSAH 4 operates efficiently as an all-way stop in current conditions and
has no immediate need for traffic control mitigation. With the presence of Breezy Point Resort and
increasing future traffic volumes on CSAH 11 and CSAH 4, the intersection should be monitored for
safety and delay to determine if or when a signal would benefit the county. The guidelines put forth in

CSAH 11 Corridor Study, Crow Wing County

Executive Summary
Crow Wing County, MN is proposing improvements at the intersections of CSAH 11 and
Edgewater Farms Drive and CSAH 11 and Ranchette Drive. The intersections are both located
on CSAH 11in the City of Breezy Point.

CSAH 11 at Edgewater Farms Drive/ Eagle View Elementary School currently operates as a thru-
stop intersection with turn lanes on CSAH 11 approaches. The future condition utilizes the same
intersection geometry, but moves the intersection to the west, making the north leg Hunt Blvd.
This change in intersection location would also be accompanied by the closure of various
accesses along CSAH 11 to reduce the number of conflict points along the corridor. A signal
warrant analysis was performed at the intersection under existing conditions, and it was
discovered that zero warrants were met. The intersection currently operates at a level of service
(LOS) F during the AM and PM Peak hours, but this is primarily due to the influx of traffic
movements attributed to the beginning and conclusion of a regular school day. Even with the
implementation of a traffic signal, the LOS is either unacceptable or approaching an unacceptable
state.

The intersection of CSAH 11 at Ranchette Drive currently operates as a thru-stop intersection
with thru lanes on the CSAH 11 approaches. The future condition utilizes the same intersection
location and geometry as present day. The main modifications to the environment surrounding
this intersection is the addition of a variety of commercial buildings. The Breezy Point Ice Arena,
located on the northwest corner of the intersection, may be planning an expansion project that
will generate additional traffic and a hotel is also proposed to the north of the current intersection.
Accompanying the future development is the closure of the current ice arena access to CSAH 11.
To the south of the intersection, a gas station/ convenience store has been considered to the west
of Ranchette Drive.

A signal warrant analysis was performed for the estimated traffic volumes currently occupying
the intersection of CSAH 11 at Ranchette Drive. The analysis indicated that a signal is not
warranted for the intersection and LOS and delay values attained from the intersection are all
within the acceptable range for existing and proposed conditions. Various forms of traffic control
were evaluated and while each produced an acceptable driving environment, the existing
condition of a thru-stop should be acceptable today and in the future.

The best intersection control option provides minimal delay to traffic with a low crash rate
potential at a low cost and fits with the nature of the roadway and community. While the thru-
stop, traffic signal, and roundabout options are acceptable in terms of capacity, delay, and safety,
a thru-stop traffic control is preferable for both study intersections. Maintaining the intersections
as a thru-stop induces no additional cost to the community and ideally would produce a below
average crash rate going forward.

The traffic volumes utilized within this study are based upon estimated AM peak hour volumes at
Ranchette Drive and estimated 12 hour approach volumes at both study intersections. The results
and conclusions drawn from this report should be considered preliminary and revisited in the

                      Intersection Control Evaluation
   I.     Location

          The intersections of County State Aid Highway 11 (CSAH 11) at Edgewater Farms
          Drive/ Eagle View Elementary School and CSAH 11 at Ranchette Drive are located
          east of the City of Pequot Lakes, approximately 2.3 and 3.3 miles, respectively, east
          of the intersection of Trunk Highway 371 (TH 371) at CSAH 11 in Breezy Point.
          Breezy Point is a free-standing city in Crow Wing County and is located
          approximately 20 miles north of the City of Brainerd. A location map is included in
          Figure 1 of Appendix A. Breezy Point's population was 947 in the year 2000 census
          and 2,162 in the 2010 census.

   II.    Existing (2011) Conditions

          The intersection of CSAH 11 at Edgewater Farms Drive/ Eagle View Elementary
          School access is a four-legged intersection with eastbound and westbound left and
          right turn lanes and a northbound thru-right and left turn lane. The posted speed limit
          of CSAH 11 is 55 mph through the intersection. In addition to Mn/DOT traffic
          counts performed in 2007, field counts were completed at the study intersections in
          September of 2011. The 2011 Average Daily Traffic Volume (ADT) is 5,600 for the
          east and west legs of CSAH 11, 850 for Edgewater Farms Drive, and 1,000 for the
          Eagle View Elementary School Access. Detailed turning movement data was
          collected for the AM peak hour at CSAH 11 and Edgewater Farms Drive /Eagle
          View Elementary School access and the PM peak hour at both study locations. The
          intersection geometry and 2011 traffic volumes can be seen in Figure 2 in Appendix
          A of this document.

          The intersection of CSAH 11 at Ranchette Drive is a four-legged intersection with
          eastbound and westbound left and right turn lanes and northbound and southbound
          right turn lanes. The posted speed limit of CSAH 11 is 55 mph through the
          intersection. The 2011 Average Daily Traffic Volume (ADT) is 5,600 to the west of
          Ranchette Drive and 5,500 to the East of Ranchette Drive. Ranchette Drive is a two-
          lane roadway with a thru-left and right turn lane at the intersection with CSAH 11.
          The posted speed limit is 55 mph. The 2011 ADT to the south of CSAH 11 was
          estimated to be 900 and the north leg of the intersection was estimated to be 1,400.
          With data collection limited to peak hour counts, ADT volumes were estimated by
          applying the k-factor, percent of total daily traffic present during peak hours, to the
          PM peak hour volumes. The total PM peak hour volumes were divided by the k-
          factor of 0.0967 to attain an estimated ADT volume. The intersection geometry and
          2011 traffic volumes can be seen in Figure 3 in Appendix A of this document.

          In addition to the peak hour turning movement count data, heavy truck data was
          collected to ensure the calculated intersection delay and level of service provide an
          accurate representation of current and future conditions. Turning movement and tube
          count data can be found in Appendix B of this document.

   III.   Future Conditions

          Crow Wing County has taken a proactive approach to managing the performance and
          safety of the CSAH 11 corridor within the cities of Pequot Lakes and Breezy Point
          with the proposed 2012 improvements. Details of intersection geometry and
          estimated traffic volumes can be found in Appendix A of this document.

          2030 traffic volumes were estimated for the study intersections by utilizing historic
          ADT volumes, turning movement counts, and engineering judgment. The baseline
          growth of the corridor was established by developing a trend line from CSAH 11
          ADT volumes attained from historic traffic data attained from MNDOT. This rate
          along with the county growth rate was then applied to the study intersections in order
          to estimate 2030 traffic volumes. The additional traffic developed with the proposed
          construction was estimated by methodology available in the ITE Trip Generation
          Manual: 8th Edition. The trips generated by proposed businesses were then added to
          the 2030 baseline traffic volumes to attain future turning movement and ADT values.

          The intersection of CSAH 11 at Edgewater Farms Drive maintains the same
          geometry, but is moved to the west where the north leg of the intersection becomes
          Hunt Blvd. This is based upon the assumption of a vision of future supporting
          roadway network. Traffic conditions for the intersection are measured and analyzed
          in the following paragraphs for thru/stop, traffic signal, and roundabout control.
          Future traffic volumes were developed based upon the redistribution of existing
          turning movements and the additional traffic created by future development and
          changes in land use. The estimated 2030 traffic volumes and geometry can be seen
          in Figure 4 of Appendix A.

          The intersection of CSAH 11 at Ranchette Drive maintains the same geometry as
          existing conditions but changes in the roadway network are assumed that are
          consistent with the vision. The intersection was analyzed with three control
          possibilities. Measures of effectiveness of the intersection are evaluated at the
          intersection for a thru/stop, traffic signal, and roundabout control. Future
          development of the properties surrounding the intersection of CSAH 11 at Ranchette
          Drive will also play a role in the operation of the future intersection. The
          enhancements to the area may include:

          North of CSAH 11
             · Future Ice Arena Expansion
             · Future Hotel

          South of CSAH 11
             · Gas Station and Convenience Store

          The estimated 2030 traffic volumes and geometry can be seen in Figure 5 of
          Appendix A.

   IV.    Operational and Safety Analysis of Alternatives

          Analysis was completed for the traffic volume scenarios; 2011 and 2030, for the
          A.M. and P.M. peak hours. The existing geometry remains intact for future
          conditions of both intersections but the intersection traffic control will be evaluated at
          each to determine the most effective form. A thru/stop, traffic signal, and roundabout
          will be analyzed and discussed for each of the study intersections. The delay, level of
          service, and volume to capacity ratio are analyzed for all existing and proposed
          scenarios. The analysis was performed using the methodology of the 2000 Highway
          Capacity Manual through Synchro, a traffic analysis software program by
          Trafficware. The level of service, delay, volume/capacity, and queue lengths found
          in Table 2 through Table 7 were attained using Sychro Analysis. The details and
          summary of each condition can be found in Appendix C of this document.

          A multi-way stop was not considered as a viable traffic control alternative due to the
          minimal cross-street and high CSAH 11 traffic volumes. This form of traffic control
          is only used at the far ends of the corridor to manage intersections with a more even
          distribution of traffic volumes for both intersecting roadways, where this type of
          control is best utilized.

          Results of the analysis are displayed as measures of effectiveness.

          A. Measures of Effectiveness

          Measures of effectiveness display quantitative information about the performance of
          an intersection or network of intersections. The primary measures that are used in this
          study are level of service and delay.

          Level of Service

          The operational analysis results are described as a Level of Service (LOS) ranging
          from A to F. These letters serve to describe a range of operating conditions for
          different types of facilities. Levels of Service are calculated based on the 2000
          Highway Capacity Manual, which defines the level of service, based on control
          delay. Control delay is the delay experienced by vehicles slowing down as they are
          approaching the intersection, the wait time at the intersection, and the time for the
          vehicle to speed up through the intersection and enter into the traffic stream. The
          average intersection control delay is a volume weighted average of delay experienced
          by all motorists entering the intersection on all intersection approaches for signalized
          and roundabout intersections. Level of Service D is commonly taken as an acceptable
          design year LOS. The level of service and its associated intersection delay for a
          signalized and unsignalized intersection is presented below. The delay threshold for
          unsignalized intersections is lower for each LOS compared to signalized
          intersections, which accounts for the fact that people expect a higher level of service
          when at a stop-controlled intersection.




                                                                                                  3

          Volume to Capacity Ratios

          Volume to capacity ratio is the proportion of the actual traffic utilizing the facility to
          the facility's physical ability to carry a specific maximum volume. This is calculated
          by dividing the total traffic using the facility by the capacity of the facility. This can
          then determine if a facility is sufficient to handle the traffic that is expected to be
          traveling on it. A ratio greater than 1.00 predicts that the facility will be unable to
          discharge all of the demand arriving on it. Such a situation would result in long
          queues and extensive delays, or diversion to alternate routes.

          B. Operational Analysis

          Unsignalized Control

          The intersections currently operate under thru-stop control with CSAH 11 having the
          eastbound and westbound as free movements. Current lane geometry is analyzed to
          ascertain how the existing intersection operates with existing traffic. The future
          conditions are analyzed to ascertain how the intersections will operate with the
          anticipated increase in traffic volumes for the year 2030. CSAH 11 currently has one
          thru lane, one left turn lane, and one right turn lane in the eastbound/westbound
          directions. There is also a southbound right turn lane and a northbound right turn
          lane with a stop condition that intersect CSAH 11. The proposed improvements at the
          intersection would not affect the geometry.

          Unacceptable delay is anticipated with thru-stop control during the AM and PM peak
          hours on the CSAH 11 at Edgewater Farms Drive/Eagle View Elementary School
          access approaches with 2030 traffic conditions present. The measures of
          effectiveness appear to be failing due to the nature of traffic at the intersection of
          CSAH 11 at Edgewater Farms Drive/Eagle View Elementary due to the significant
          influx of vehicles that revolve around the beginning and end of a the school day. The

                                                                                                       4

          number of vehicles present during the 30 minute to one hour period in the AM and
          PM cause the maximum delay of an isolated movement to increase and hinder the
          overall performance of the intersection.

          The number of vehicles passing through the intersection to pick up and drop off
          children at the elementary school causes the intersection to fail during two distinct
          periods of the day. Altering the traffic control would help to maintain acceptable
          operations based on the forecasted traffic growth from 2011 to 2030 at the
          intersection. The change in traffic control would reduce delay for the minor
          approaches.

          Table 3 indicates that the intersection of CSAH 11 at Ranchette Drive operates at an
          acceptable level of service during existing conditions. The additional traffic
          occupying the intersection increases the delay and level of service of the intersection
          causing it to approach an unacceptable during the 2030 PM peak hour.

          Signalized Control

          The operational analysis at CSAH 11 and Edgewater Farms Drive/ Hunt Blvd/ Eagle
          View Elementary School Access was analyzed with the proposed intersection layout
          and the addition of a traffic signal. The left turns at the intersection, in all signalized
          scenarios, were assumed to be permitted turning movements on CSAH 11. The left
          turns on Edgewater Farms Drive and the Eagle View Elementary School approach
          were also assumed to be permitted turning movements to maximize vehicle
          movement within the chosen cycle length.

          A signal at CSAH 11 at Edgewater Farms Drive/ Hunt Blvd/ Eagle View Elementary
          is anticipated to maintain acceptable operation in existing and 2030 conditions. The
          existing geometries established at CSAH 11 at Edgewater Farms Drive/ Eagle View
          Elementary and CSAH 11 at Ranchette Drive would be sufficient for the 2011 and
          2030 traffic scenarios. The primary form of mitigation analyzed within this study
          revolves around the traffic control of the intersection, and does not focus on altering
          the intersection lane configurations. The results of the signal warrant analysis can be
          seen in Appendix D of this document and delay and level of service values are shown
          in Table 4 and Table 5, below.

          The signal analysis included the evaluation of vehicle queue lengths that are likely to
          appear with the proposed traffic. These queue lengths determine how long the turn
          lanes need to be and also provide a look into how the intersection would appear to be
          operating to the traveling public.

          Based on the queue lengths in Table 6, it is anticipated that queuing associated with
          the installation of a signal will not be a concern. The maximum queues for both the
          2011 and 2030 traffic scenarios, on all approaches, are shorter than the lengths of the
          turn lanes. With the turn lane lengths being longer than the queues, this will allow
          traffic to enter the turn lanes without being blocked and keep turning traffic from
          blocking thru traffic.

          The introduction of a traffic control signal at an intersection must include an
          engineering study to determine whether the installation of a signal is justified at a
          particular location. This includes an investigation into the need for the traffic control
          signal through a traffic signal warrant analysis as outlined in the December 2011
          Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MMUTCD). Traffic from
          the 2011 field counts were evaluated with respect to the traffic signal warrants
          outlined in Chapter 4C. Analysis indicates that the intersections fail to meet warrants
          for signalization. Right turns were removed from the minor street approach volumes
          in accordance with MMUTCD procedures. This analysis is included in Appendix D.

          While the LOS and intersection delay indicate a positive impact is made with the
          implementation of a traffic signal, it does not draw the conclusion that a signal is
          warranted. Table 3 and Table 4 display the amount of congestion present at the
          intersection during two one-hour periods and do not describe the overall operation for
          an entire day. The signal warrant analysis evaluates existing traffic volumes for peak
          hours, four-hour time periods, and 8-hour time periods. Therefore, it is able to
          provide a more comprehensive analysis then looking solely at the two highest hourly
          periods of the day.

          Roundabout Control

          With a change of traffic control to a roundabout, the reconstruction of the intersection
          would be necessary. A concept of a roundabout at the CSAH 11 and Edgewater
          Farms Drive/Eagle View Elementary School intersection would include a single-lane
          roundabout with single-lane entrances for all four approaches. The geometric layout
          was analyzed for the 2011 and 2030 traffic volumes using RODEL Roundabout
          Analysis. The raw output from RODEL can be seen for each condition in Appendix E
          of this document.

          Similar procedures were also utilized for the evaluation of CSAH 11 at Ranchette
          Drive. The results are as follows:

          The measures of effectiveness of the study intersections indicate that both operate at
          a level of service A in 2011 and 2030. While the results shown in Table 7 and Table
          8 indicate that a roundabout is a viable option for the study intersections, the traffic
          conditions may lead to a different conclusion. The short queue lengths shown in
          Table 9 and Table 10 fortify the assumption that a roundabout would be able to
          support the existing and proposed traffic volumes on the CSAH 11 corridor. The
          analysis indicates that while a roundabout would adequately provide movement to
          vehicles passing through the intersections, it is not necessarily the best solution for
          either of the study intersections.

          The primary movements on the corridor stem from CSAH 11 and do not see much
          contention from side street movements. The implementation of a roundabout without
          significant cross-street traffic would create a situation similar to the present day
          traffic control of a thru-stop. While it may operate similar to a thru-stop, a
          roundabout is a potential safety concern in the event a CSAH 11 motorist discounts
          the possibility of a conflicting movement and crashes into adjoining roadway traffic.
          Therefore, a roundabout is not considered a viable traffic control alternative due to
          the minimal number of conflicting traffic intersecting CSAH 11.

          While the LOS, delay, and queue lengths indicate that a positive impact is made with
          the implementation of a roundabout, it does not draw the conclusion that a
          roundabout is warranted. The values produced in Table 3 and Table 4 display the
          amount of congestion present at the intersection during two one-hour periods and do
          not take into account the overall operation for an entire day. The reduced delay and
          LOS shown in Table 7 and Table 8 make it undeniable that a roundabout may benefit
          both intersections during the heavily traveled AM and PM peak hours, but this a
          small portion of the entire day and therefore does not directly warrant a roundabout
          be installed.

          C. Safety Analysis

          Safety is an important consideration when evaluating the traffic control at an
          intersection. Both a signal and roundabout will change the look and character of the
          intersection, altering how a driver, biker, or pedestrian will react to potential conflict.
          A change in intersection traffic control will also change the type of crashes and the
          expected number of crashes at an intersection.

          The Traffic Safety Fundamentals Handbook by the Minnesota Department of
          Transportation - Office of Traffic Engineering (published in August 2008),
          Roundabouts: An Informational Guide by FHWA (Pub. No. FHWA-RD-00-067),
          and Crash Reductions Following Installation of Roundabouts in the United States by
          the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (March 2000) provide average crash rates
          for different traffic control options. These rates are determined using state-wide (stop
          and signal control) and nation-wide (roundabout control) average crash rates for
          intersections with the same type of traffic control and apply to an average volume of
          traffic expected at the intersection.




                                                                                                    9

CSAH 11 Corridor Study, Crow Wing County

          While these rates provide a safety comparison of the different traffic control options,
          changes in traffic volume, delay, or capacity from the average can alter how the
          intersection operates. This can result in a situation where the average crash rates no
          longer apply. Crash frequency at intersections is measured based upon the crash rate,
          which is shown as crashes per million entering vehicles (MEV).

          There have been 0 reported crashes from 2006 to 2010 at the intersection of CSAH
          11 and Edgewater Farms Drive/ Eagle View Elementary School. The crash rate for
          the intersection over these five years is 0 per million entering vehicles (MEV). A
          crash rate of 0 is below the statewide average of 0.3 MEV for rural thru-stop
          intersections. The average crash rate for a similar type signalized intersection is 0.6
          per MEV. The crash rate is anticipated to remain the same if a thru-stop control is
          maintained, but may escalate if a traffic signal was added to the intersection.

          There have been 3 reported crashes from 2006 to 2010 at the intersection of CSAH
          11 and Ranchette Drive. The crash rate for the intersection over these five years is
          0.24 per million entering vehicles (MEV). A crash rate of 0.24 is below the statewide
          average of 0.3 MEV for rural thru-stop intersections. The average crash rate for a
          similar type signalized intersection is 0.6 per MEV. There was a total of one rear end,
          one right angle, and one left turn crash reported. Additional crash details and a crash
          diagram can be found in Appendix F of this document. The crash rate is anticipated
          to remain the same if a thru-stop control is maintained, but may escalate if a traffic
          signal was added to the intersection.

   V.     Additional Considerations

          Other items typically considered in this type of evaluation may include pedestrian
          and/or bicycle issues. Currently there is very little pedestrian activity at the study
          intersections. This is due to the proximity of the intersections to the cities of Pequot
          Lakes and Breezy Point.

          While the elementary school is located on the south side of CSAH 11 at the
          intersection of CSAH 11 at Edgewater Farms Drive/ Eagle View Elementary School
          Access, there is little to no pedestrian traffic at the study intersection. This can be
          attributed to the minimal number of students located within walking distance of the
          school and the fact that the entire school campus, including athletic fields, is located
          to the south of CSAH 11.

          The addition of a gas station and convenience store on the south side of CSAH 11 at
          Ranchette Drive, shown in Figure 5, could increase pedestrian traffic traveling to and
          from the ice arena and the proposed hotel. Increased volumes of pedestrian traffic
          crossing CSAH 11 may become an issue going forward and therefore should be
          reevaluated following the construction of the proposed commercial growth at CSAH
          11 at Ranchette Drive.

   VI.    Conclusion/Remarks/Engineering Recommendations

          CSAH 11 at Edgewater Farms Dr./ Hunt Blvd./ Eagle View Elementary Access

          Both a traffic signal and a roundabout would provide adequate capacity and
          acceptable delay for current traffic levels and traffic levels in the future. With an
          increase in traffic at the intersection of CSAH 11 at Hunt Blvd/ Eagle View
          Elementary School Access, the current thru-stop traffic control should be capable of
          accommodating elevated traffic volumes and maintain an adequate level of safety to
          motorists. With zero crashes present at the intersection in the past five years, a
          change in traffic control could lead to crashes due to driver unfamiliarity to the
          changed intersection conditions.

          The best intersection control option provides minimal delay to traffic with a low
          crash rate potential at a low cost and fits with the nature of the roadway and
          community. While the thru-stop, traffic signal, and roundabout options are
          acceptable in terms of capacity, delay, and safety, a thru-stop traffic control is
          preferable for the intersection. Maintaining the intersection as a thru-stop induces no
          additional cost to the community and ideally would produce a negligible crash rate,
          as in the past, going forward.

          Both a traffic signal and a roundabout would provide adequate capacity and
          acceptable delay for current traffic levels and traffic levels in the future. With an
          increase in traffic at the intersection of CSAH 11 at Ranchette Drive, the current thru-
          stop traffic control should be capable of accommodating elevated traffic volumes and
          maintain an adequate level of safety to motorists. With three crashes present at the
          intersection in the past five years, a change in traffic control could lead to additional
          crashes due to driver unfamiliarity to the changed intersection conditions.

          The best intersection control option provides minimal delay to traffic with a low
          crash rate potential at a low cost and fits with the nature of the roadway and
          community. While the thru-stop, traffic signal, and roundabout options are
          acceptable in terms of capacity, delay, and safety, a thru-stop traffic control is
          preferable for the intersection. Maintaining the intersection as a thru-stop induces no
          additional cost to the community and ideally would produce a below average crash
          rates, as in the past, going forward.

          The traffic volumes utilized within this study are based upon estimated AM peak
          hour volumes at Ranchette Drive and estimated 12 hour approach volumes at both
          study intersections. The results and conclusions drawn from this report should be
          considered preliminary and revisited in the future. The intersections of CSAH 11 at
          Edgewater Farms Drive/ Eagle View Elementary and CSAH 11 at Ranchette Drive
          should also be revisited if and when the proposed commercial properties are in full
          operation.

SUBAREA STUDY TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM 


 
                                               MEMORANDUM


      Date: November 8, 2011
        To: Crow Wing County Highway Department
    From: Eric Johnson, P.E.
               Phillip Martin, P.E.
  Subject: Subarea Study - Akerson Road / Buschmann Road Corridor Improvements




Background & Overview
Due to the proposed access changes with the TH 371
bypass alternative and the widely discussed issues
associated with Buschmann Road in Breezy Point,
consideration has been given to the development of a
second route, parallel to CSAH 11, which would
address existing traffic issues and future traffic
generated with the bypass alternative.

The proposed TH 371 bypass alignment will create a
new intersection at the west end of Akerson Road near
its current junction of CR 112 as shown in the graphic
to the right. The creation of this TH 371 connection on
the west end of Akerson Road has created a renewed
interest by the County to evaluate a combined
improvement of Akerson Road and Buschmann Road
as a parallel corridor to CSAH 11 north of Pequot
Lakes and Breezy Point.

This Memorandum documents the preliminary
assessment of the two roadways and the challenges
related to their width, current vertical/horizontal
alignments, and the extensive presence of wetlands.

This preliminary assessment includes identification of
potential challenges that would have to be overcome or
preclude it from being utilized as a future parallel route
to the CSAH 11 Corridor. Available GIS mapping has
been utilized in conjunction with a site visit to
document challenges. These include technical,
regulatory agency, and community issues and concerns.
A planning-level cost estimate required to achieve County State Aid Standards has been prepared.

Existing Conditions
Ackerson Road and Buschmann Road are City streets that run east-west between CSAH 112 in Pequot
Lakes and CSAH 11 in Breezy Point. Akerson Road is the western 2 miles of the corridor and
Buschmann Road is the eastern 2.4 miles of the 4.4 mile corridor. The alignment of the roadway
conforms to the existing topography with substandard vertical and horizontal geometrics which limit sight
distance. The posted speed of the corridor is 40 mph, but the design fails to meet this speed in numerous
locations. The "goat trail," as it has been apparently referred to in the past, was graded and widened with
aggregate many years ago, and eventually paved in 1996.




The existing right-of-way varies from 66 feet to essentially prescriptive easements for the occupied width.
There are no City utilities in these areas of the communities. The sizes of the parcels abutting the road are
large enough to not require City sanitary sewer according to City policy. Two overhead power lines exist
on the south side of the road that conflict with roadway widening.

Akerson Road and Buschmann Road are used by residents living adjacent to the corridor and by multiple
commercial aggregate operations located along and north of the corridor. Motorists have also found the
route attractive as a short cut between County Highway 11 and County Highway 16. Beyond the west end
of Buschmann Road, it is an additional two miles to County Highway 16, via one mile north on Nelson
Road and one mile west on Wild Acres Road. This route abuts the jurisdictions of Pequot Lakes, Ideal
Township, and Jenkins Township. An alternate route is one mile west on Akerson Road and one mile
north on Evenson Road.

           Crow Wing County, Minnesota

Akerson Road and Buschmann Road are located in an area of the communities that are not extensively
developed. There are some residential lots with septic systems and wells along the corridor. Both the City
of Pequot Lakes and Breezy Point Comprehensive plans do not anticipate substantial change in the land
use vision along the corridor. The area adjacent to the corridor is mostly wooded with wetlands dispersed
throughout. In many places, the wooded areas extend to the edge of the road. Improvements to the
horizontal and vertical alignment will likely impact adjacent property, including woods and wetlands. The
extent of those impacts will be dependent on the long-term jurisdiction and corresponding corridor design
standards.

In 2008, the City of Breezy Point counted traffic on Buschmann Road as part of a preliminary engineering
study. The average annual daily traffic (AADT) was estimated to be approximately 800 vehicles at that
time. Heavy commercial traffic accounts for approximately 10 to 15 percent of the traffic. The heavy
commercial vehicle traffic varies on the mining operations. The City worked with the County to
determine that an upgraded roadway in the future (2030) should be expected to carry 1,500 vehicles per
day.

According to the Mn/DOT Crash Mapping Analysis Tool database, there have been no reported crashes
within the five year period from 2005 to 2010 on the corridor. However, there have been numerous local
reports of traffic incidents on the corridor. Limited sight distances, numerous access points, and
increasing truck traffic could contribute to actual or perceived safety risks.

As part of the 2008 preliminary engineering study, topography was obtained and roadway alignments
were evaluated. Multiple alignment alternatives were developed for the intersections at Ranchette Drive
and Nelson Road. In 2008, the City conducted a number of public meetings on the project directed toward
the residents who live along the corridor. The City has also conducted meetings with representatives from
Crow Wing County and the neighboring jurisdictions.

An issues map has been prepared and attached to this document that summarizes the existing conditions
along the corridor.

Improvements Needed to Upgrade to County Standards
If the corridor were upgraded to County standards, the roadway should have:
      12' lanes and 6' shoulders
      30' clear zone should be provided to minimize conflicts with roadside hazards
      Pavement design to 10-ton design standards to carry truck traffic
      Design speed should be 50 mph or greater
      The horizontal and vertical site distance will need to be improved to allow for proper sight
         distance
      A maximum of a 1:4 inslope
      Utility relocation (Utility poles)
      A larger right-of-way corridor (estimated at 100') is needed to accommodate this standard
      Geometric improvements at the intersection of Akerson Road, Buschmann Road, and Nelson
         Road
      Geometric improvements at the intersection of Buschmann Road and Ranchette Drive
      Geometric improvements may be needed at CSAH 11 and Buschmann Road

The 2008 Breezy Point study just looked at Buschmann Road, but found these improvements detailed
above were needed to upgrade the roadway. The preliminary alignment options developed at that time are

             attached to this document. Similar improvements will be needed along Akerson Road as the same issues
             and constraints are along that roadway.

             Estimated Costs
             Planning level cost estimates have been prepared for the corridor improvements. These estimates are very
             high-level and need to be revisited as improvements are further developed in the future. These estimates
             reflect costs in 2011 dollars.

             Construction costs for roadway improvements are estimated at $1,000,000 per mile. Utility relocation is
             estimated at $125,000 per mile on Buschmann Road and Akerson Road. The existing right-of-way
             (ROW) width varies to 66'. To achieve the desired 100' corridor width, it was estimated an additional 40'
             will need to be acquired along Akerson Road and Buschmann Road. It was assumed a new 66' corridor of
             ROW will need to be acquired for the improvements to Ranchette Drive. ROW acquisition was estimated
             to cost $40,000 per acre.

             Project development and delivery costs were estimated at 20% of all costs. This estimate should cover
             preliminary and final design, ROW acquisition services, as well as construction inspection services.

             Below is a summary of the cost estimates completed.

             Conclusions
             The connections Buschmann Road and Akerson Road provide are valuable connections to the region. The
             corridor is substandard and a safety concern if increased traffic would utilize it in the current state. If the
             corridor were upgraded to the appropriate County standards, the roadway could become a County
             roadway. Improvements to upgrade the roadway are cost prohibitive at this point. Currently funding
             programs are very limited to assist this project to be constructed. The local governments cannot afford to
             upgrade this corridor at this time. The project stakeholders should continue to monitor the traffic volumes
             and crash history on the roadways, especially as traffic patterns adjust to the TH 371 bypass in 2018. This
             roadway could have a larger role in the overall roadway network with the connection to TH 371. If
             demands on the corridor increase, this study and recommendations should be revisited to determine if
             upgrades should be completed at a later date and if the jurisdiction of the roadway should be transferred to
             the County.

CSAH 11 CORRIOR STUDY REPORT 

 




APPENDIX F ­ PEQUOT LAKES VISION 
 
Memorandum

Date:   February 22, 2012

To:     Crow Wing County Highway Department

From: Charles Marohn, Pequot Lakes City Planner

Re:     County State Aid Highway 11

At their February 16 meeting, the City of Pequot Lakes Planning Commission reviewed the County's
proposal for improvements to CSAH 11. Various questions from the County Highway Department were
also reviewed. The following is preliminary feedback on the proposed project and questions from the
County Highway Department. The Planning Commission will continue to review the project at the
March 14, 2012 meeting. A representative from the County is welcome to attend the meeting to
answer any questions the Planning Commission may have.



Function: The primary function of this segment of CSAH 11 is to provide a framework for capturing value
from the local land use pattern. The primary function is not moving traffic at speed. East of the future
TH 371 alignment, the primary function becomes moving traffic at speed ­ it is important that this
corridor remain a safe and efficient highway for high-speed automobile travel -- but west of the future
intersection, the movement of traffic at high speeds is counterproductive.

Capturing Value: The City of Pequot Lakes has made some enormous investments in ­ and has some
very large obligations for long-term maintenance of ­ infrastructure within its core downtown. In order
to make sufficient use of these investments, the transportation system within the core downtown needs
to provide a platform for capturing value.

Street segments, including CSAH 11, must provide for a complex, town environment. We must
accommodate the movement of traffic as well as the sudden stopping and turning of cars, the parking of
cars, safe interaction with pedestrians and bikers as well as a community ambiance that has a
recreational destination feel. For this level of complexity, automobile traffic must be slow and must
share priority with other modes of travel within the public realm.
It is only with this type of design that downtown Pequot Lakes can attract and retain the level of private
sector investment necessary to sustain prior investments. There needs to be natural, market demand for
filling in the gaps between existing structures and, over time, making incremental improvements to
increase the intensity of use of existing structures. This will only happen if (1) people can get to Pequot
Lakes quickly and easily and (2) once in town, can be accommodated in a comfortable, town setting.

Concept #1: The concept put forward by the County labeled "Concept 1" is the closest representation of
what a future CSAH 11 corridor within downtown Pequot Lakes needs to look like. To that concept, as
presented, we suggest the following modifications:

    1. In general, the median should be removed and the automobile travel lanes reduced to 10 feet.
       Correspondingly, the sidewalks should be widened by 5 to 6 feet on each side of the street. The
       cost difference of moving the concrete from the center of the street ­ where it has little value ­
       to the edge of the street where it creates immense value for the adjacent property owners,
       should be negligible. Narrowing the lanes will further slow traffic through this section and allow
       for a more complex environment to emerge.

    2. The space available at County Road 112 provides an opportunity to offset reduced design
       speeds by providing for a continuous flow intersection. A properly-designed round-a-bout
       (meaning designed to a neighborhood context, not a highway context) would improve flow and
       reduce stacking in this area.

    3. The intersections at Government Drive and N. Washington Ave. should be designed to
       emphasize shared space. The intersections should be designed to provide for automobile and
       pedestrian traffic in a free flow (not priority) design. Traffic will be going slow enough through
       this section where such a design should be attainable.

    4. Ultimately, the intersection with TH 371 needs to be reconfigured to provide for continuous
       flow with a complex town environment. For the time being, the design as presented is
       adequate.

    5. It is highly questionable what the value of a "future collector roadway" would be as presented. If
       said roadway is to be a frontage road along the highway, the improvement would need to be
       development driven. If the desire is to provide for industrial traffic, the design for TH 371
       provides for such traffic at the southern junction with the current TH 371 alignment. Extending
       E. Woodman St. would be quite costly and it is not clear what benefit it would provide in terms
       of adding to the value captured within the downtown, particularly since it would require the
       condemnation and removal of at least one home.

        As such, it is premature and likely unwarranted to plan CSAH 11 to accommodate such an
        improvement. What is planned for areas to the west would also give mixed signals to drivers
        leaving the highway, confusing them that they are passing through a high-speed environment,
         and thus be likely cause unsafe conditions. If a street were put in to the south at this point, it
         would follow the grid pattern set up in the downtown and thus not function as a "collector" as
         shown.

         The turn lanes should be removed and the same section that begins at Government Drive should
         be extended to the west.

      6. The City would desire to coordinate with the improvements to have the existing overhead
         electrical and telephone wires buried, existing street lighting removed and pedestrian-scaled
         lighting installed as part of the improvement.

Concept 2 is a variation on Concept 1 with greater emphasis on improving traffic speed. Concept 3
employs the "third lane" concept for the same reason. Neither of these alternatives meets the
objectives and priorities of the City of Pequot Lakes.

+++

In response to your specific questions, we offer the following:

      1. Does/can the City support the CSAH 11 Corridor Study that is underway?

Yes, the City of Pequot Lakes supports efforts to plan for the future of CSAH 11.

      2. Does the City support turnback of CSAH 11 to the City?

The City of Pequot Lakes is not categorically opposed to the turnback and may ultimately be in support
of it. The main issues in determining the mood of the City on this matter will be the long-term cost of
the corridor, the ability of the corridor to create and capture value for the taxpayers of Pequot Lakes
and the extent and ramifications of any other turnback commitments the City will make as part of the
project. As this point, it is too early to speak definitively on this.

      3. Does the City view CSAH 11 as a gateway to the community once the bypass is in place?

Yes. Absolutely.

      4. What is the City's vision for CSAH 11 between existing and proposed TH 371?

In a big picture sense, the area between the existing and proposed TH 371 must be about creating and
capturing value within the City. The first half of this memo details the City's vision for how to accomplish
that.

      5. If the City does want changes along CSAH 11, then what do you envision for:
              a. Roadway improvements?
              b. Pedestrian accommodations?
              c. Parking?
              d. Access?
              e. Land Use?
            f.   Other?

Again, see the first half of this memo.

    6. How is the City going to prevent land use changes around the interchange as council members
       and planning commission staff changes?

This question seems to be based on a number of incorrect assumptions. First, the City is not in the
business of "preventing" land use changes. To state otherwise is a misnomer.

Second, there is an underlying assumption in the question that somehow the City's approach to this
corridor will not withstand future scrutiny, that a future Council will take a different course of action.
This seems to be based on the belief that strip highway development, complete with frontage roads and
the extension of sewer and water utilities, is somehow the natural order of municipal development.

The study group should be clear on what the City of Pequot Lakes has done. The City has analyzed the
cost of running utilities to the alternate alignment. Just that expense alone ­ not even including the cost
for frontage roads and further extension of utilities ­ cannot be justified by any cost/benefit analysis
performed. The City's cost for this style of development far exceeds anything the taxpayers of Pequot
Lakes can hope to receive back in terms of additional tax revenue.

Based on that finding, the City opted not to pay the millions of dollars to extend the utilities to the new
alignment and has elected not to proactively "up-zone" properties for more intensive use.
To be clear; there is nothing in the City's approach that prohibits development along the new TH 371.
The only thing that makes Pequot Lakes different from the other communities along the corridor is that
we have chosen not to pass large tax increases onto our residents and business owners ­ either today or
in the future ­ to subsidize development along the highway.

    7. Should the City be planning for growth around the new interchange?

The City has planned for growth around the new interchange. The development pattern is an extension
of the downtown pattern, which is a mere block away.

Again, there appears to be an assumption that the City should be planning for highway-oriented
development such as a gas station or a fast food stop. Even if the City did not already have existing
convenience stores and restaurants that we value, there is little to be gained financially in an approach
that would have the City subsidize that style of development in that location.

    8. What other plans does the City have for accommodating the bypass?

We're not sure what is being asked with this question.

    9. If not now, when does the City feel is the appropriate time to plan for these improvements?

The City of Pequot Lakes has planned extensively for the rerouting of TH 371. Again, the question seems
to be assuming that the City should be planning for a specific style of development. We have studied
what other communities along the corridor have done and found it to be financially unproductive for
Pequot Lakes. We are not going to repeat that approach, so the assumption that there will be strip
highway "improvements" is uninformed.

Charles Marohn would be happy to meet with the study group to discuss this memo and the planning
efforts of the City in regards to the realignment of TH 371.

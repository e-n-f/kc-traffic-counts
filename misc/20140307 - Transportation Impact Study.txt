EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of this study is to examine the potential traffic impact associated with the proposed
Boyertown Area Senior High School Expansion on the roadway network in Colebrookdale
Township and Boyertown Borough, Berks County, PA. Based on this evaluation, the following
conclusions were reached:
1.   The project scope and the extent of the study area were confirmed with representatives of
     PennDOT, Colebrookdale Township and Boyertown Borough. The study area
     intersections included in this TIS are as follows:
           Montgomery Avenue and Reading Avenue/Henry Avenue;
           Montgomery Avenue and North Reading Avenue (southwest of Rt. 100 interchange);
           Montgomery Avenue and county Line Road/ E. 8th Street;
           Reading Avenue and 7th Street;
           Monroe Street and 5th Street/School Driveway;
           Kehl Street and Western High School Driveway;
           Kehl Street and Eastern High School Driveway;
           4th Street and Washington Street;
           4th Street and Monroe Street;
           4th Street and Madison Street;
           Philadelphia Avenue and Washington Street;
           Philadelphia Avenue and Monroe Street;
           Philadelphia Avenue and Madison Street;
           Philadelphia Avenue and Jefferson Street.
2.   This report has been prepared in accordance with PennDOT's policies. The project scope
     and the extent of the study area were confirmed with representatives of PennDOT,
     Colebrookdale Township and Boyertown Borough at a meeting on January 16, 2014.
3.   The Boyertown Area High School is located in both Colebrookdale Township and
     Boyertown Borough. The project site is bound by Montgomery Avenue to the north, 4 th
     Street to the south, Monroe Street to east and Berks Street to the west. It is TPD's
     understanding that the High School currently serves a total of 1737 students in 10th-12th
     grades. With the proposed expansion, 9th grade students (up to 600 students) will be added.
     In addition, existing space within the School will be reconfigured to accommodate a
     potential 200 additional students within any grade.
4.   The School is currently served by three (3) existing driveways; one to Monroe Street, and
     two to Kehl Street. One new access to Montgomery Avenue (S.R. 2069) is proposed in
     conjunction with the proposed school expansion. In addition, the existing access to
     Monroe Street, opposite 5th Street, will be modified to provide one-way inbound flow only.
     Vehicles currently exiting the school at this location will now use Monroe Street to exit the
     School.
5.   With the reprofiling of the on-site embankment the site distances for the proposed access to
     Montgomery Avenue will satisfy the applicable PennDOT criteria.

6.   Upon full build-out, the proposed development is expected to generate 344 new vehicle-
     trips during the weekday A.M. peak hour and 232 new vehicle-trips during the afternoon
     peak hour.
7.   Colebrookdale Township's Roadway Sufficiency Analysis and Transportation Capital
     Improvements Plan, dated August 2005, identifies improvements at the following study
     area intersections:
         North Reading Avenue and Montgomery Avenue;
         Montgomery Avenue and Reading Avenue/Henry Avenue.
8.   Under projected conditions with the new Montgomery Avenue access and the additional
     students, all levels of service at the study area intersection comply with the requirement
     outlined in PennDOT's TIS Guidelines.
9.   Traffic Planning and Design Inc. (TPD) recommends the following roadway improvements
     as outlined at the study area intersections:
         Construct a westbound Montgomery Avenue left turn lane at the proposed site access;
         Provide a separate left and right turn lane exiting the proposed site access to Montgomery
         Avenue;
         Design the proposed site access to Montgomery Avenue in accordance with PennDOT's
         criteria;
         Contribute to Colebrookdale Township's transportation impact fee.
10. Levels of Service (LOS) for the study area intersections have been summarized in matrix
    form. Tables I and II details the overall intersection LOS for each study area intersection.

INTRODUCTION

Traffic Planning and Design, Inc. (TPD) has completed a Transportation Impact Study (TIS) for
the proposed Boyertown Area High School Expansion in Colebrookdale Township and
Boyertown Borough, Berks County, Pennsylvania. As shown in Figure 1, the project site is
bound by Montgomery Avenue to the north, 4th Street to the south, Monroe Street to east and
Berks Street to the west. It is TPD's understanding that the High School currently serves a total
of 1737 students in 10th-12th grades. With the proposed expansion, 9th grade students (up to 600
students) will be added. In addition, existing space within the School will be reconfigured to
accommodate a potential 200 additional students within any grade. The site plan is shown in
Figure 2.

This report has been prepared in accordance with PennDOT's Policies and Procedures for
Transportation Impact Studies, dated January 28, 2009 and Appendix G per PennDOT Strike-
Off Letter 494-13-13, dated December 2, 2013. The project scope and the extent of the study
area were confirmed with representatives of PennDOT, Colebrookdale Township and Boyertown
Borough at a meeting on January 16, 2014. All relevant correspondence pertaining to this
project has been included in Appendix A.

Site Access Locations
The School is currently served by three (3) existing driveways; one to Monroe Street, and two to
Kehl Street. One new access to Montgomery Avenue (S.R. 2069) is proposed in conjunction
with the proposed school expansion. In addition, the existing access to Monroe Street, opposite
5th Street, will be modified to provide one-way inbound flow only. Vehicles currently exiting the
school at this location will now use Monroe Street to exit the School.

EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK

A field review of the existing roadway system in the study area was conducted. The existing
roadway characteristics within the study area are summarized in Table 1. Photographs of the
study area intersections are included in Appendix B.

Land Use Context
In Chapter 4 of the Smart Transportation Guidebook, dated March 2008, there is guidance
pertaining to defining the land use context(s) for a given area. Based upon review of this
information, the land uses surrounding the proposed site best fits the designations as described
below given that it falls in both the Borough and the Township:
   Town/Village Neighborhood, "Predominantly residential neighborhoods, sometimes mixed
   with retail, restaurants and offices. In urban place, residential buildings tend to be close to
   the street. . . .Block sizes are regular and often small in comparison to suburban
   neighborhood blocks. Even where streets are narrow, on-street parking is common and
   typically well used. The large majority of neighborhoods have sidewalks."



                                                -2-
BOYERTOWN AREA HIGH SCHOOL EXPANSION TRANSPORTATION IMPACT STUDY




   Town/Village Center, "a mixed-use, high density area with building adjacent to the
   sidewalk, typically two to four stories tall with commercial operations on the ground floor
   and offices or residences above. Parallel parking usually occupies both sides of the street
   with parking lots behind the buildings. Important public buildings, such as the town hall or
   library, are provided special prominence."

Roadway Type
In Chapter 5 of the Smart Transportation Guidebook, there is guidance pertaining to defining the
transportation context(s) for a given area. Comparing the existing condition roadway characteristics
to the various options presented in Table 5.1 of the Smart Transportation Guidebook, the PennDOT
study area roadways best fit the following categories, as described below:
   Community Arterial, traffic volumes of 5,000 to 25,000 vehicles per day, intersection spacing
   of 300 to 1,320 feet, a desired operating speed of 25-55 mph, and a description as follows:
   "often classified as Minor Arterial in traditional classification but may include road segments
   classified as Principal Arterial."
    Philadelphia Avenue (S.R. 0073)
   Community Collector, traffic volumes of 5,000 to 15,000 vehicles per day, intersection spacing
   of 300 to 660 feet, a desired operating speed of 25-55 mph, and a description as follows: "often
   similar in appearance to a community arterial. Typically classified as Major Collector."
    Reading Avenue (S.R. 2067)
   Neighborhood Collector, traffic volumes of <6,000 vehicles per day, intersection spacing of
   300 to 660 feet, a desired operating speed of 25-35 mph, and a description as follows: "similar
   in appearance to local roadways. Typically classified as Minor Collector."
    Montgomery Avenue (S.R. 2069)

Pedestrian Facilities
Based on observations during field visits, sidewalks currently accommodate pedestrian traffic in
the vicinity of the proposed development within the Borough. There is no sidewalk along
Montgomery Avenue in the vicinity of the proposed access within Colebrookdale Township.


EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

Manual Turning Movement Counts
Manual traffic counts were conducted on 15-minute intervals during the weekday morning (6:30 to
8:30 A.M.), and weekday afternoon (2:15 to 6:00 P.M.) peak periods. Data pertaining to heavy
vehicles, pedestrians and transit vehicles were observed during the manual counts. Peak hours and
count dates for the study area intersections are identified in Table 2.

Existing condition traffic volumes for the weekday A.M. and weekday afternoon peak hours are
illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. Manual traffic count data sheets are provided in
Appendix C.

Speed Study
TPD conducted a speed study using a Decatur Radar Gun on Montgomery Avenue, in the
vicinity of the proposed site driveway location. The travel speed, as defined by PennDOT, is
established by determining the 85th percentile speed, which is the speed which 85% of the drivers
travel at or below. Based on the speed study, the 85th percentile speed on Montgomery Avenue
in the vicinity of the proposed site driveway location was found to be 39 m.p.h. in both the
eastbound and westbound directions. The speed study worksheets are included in Appendix C.

BASE (NO-BUILD) CONDITIONS

Annual Background Growth
A background growth factor for the roadways in the study area was developed based on growth
factors for September 2012 to July 2013 obtained from the PennDOT Bureau of Planning and
Research (BPR). The PennDOT BPR suggests using a background growth trend factor of 0.71%
per year in Berks County for urban non-interstate roadways. As such, the background growth factor
was applied annually to yield overall growth percentages of 2.15% (0.71% per year, compounded
over 3 years) for the 2017 opening year and 5.82% (0.71% per year, compounded over 8 years) for
the 2022 design year.

The additional traffic volumes due to background growth and background developments were
added to the existing traffic data to produce 2017 and 2022 base (no-build) condition traffic
volumes. Base condition volumes for the weekday A.M. and afternoon peak hours are illustrated in
Figures 5 and 6 for the 2017 opening year conditions, and Figures 7 and 8 for the 2022 design
year conditions.

A sight distance analysis was prepared for the proposed site driveway to Montgomery Avenue. In
general, recommended safe sight distances depend upon the posted speed limit and roadway grades.
The existing sight distances at the proposed driveways were measured in accordance with PennDOT
Publication 282 Highway Occupancy Permit Guidelines and compared to PennDOT's desirable
sight distance standard, which is identified in 67 PA Code Chapter 441.8(h), "Access to and
Occupancy of Highways by Driveways and Local Roads." In addition, measured sight distances at
the proposed driveways were compared to PennDOT's safe stopping sight distance standard, which
is calculated by the following equation:
                                  SSSD = 1.47VT + V2/[30(fg)]
                      SSSD = safe stopping sight distance (acceptable sight distance)
                      V = Vehicle Speed
                      T = Perception Reaction Time of Driver (2.5 seconds)
                      f = Coefficient of Friction for Wet Pavements
                      g = Percent of Roadway Grade Divided by 100

Table 3 shows the desirable and acceptable (SSSD) sight distances at the site driveway for
passenger cars entering and exiting the site, and compares the requirements to the available sight
distance.

addition, based on the sight line profile included in Appendix D, adequate sight distance will
also be provided for a bus.

TRIP GENERATION

The trip generation rates for the High School were obtained from the manual Trip Generation,
Ninth Edition, 2012, an Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Informational Report. The
statistics in Trip Generation are empirical data based on more than 4,800 trip generation studies.

For the proposed Boyertown Area High School expansion, Land Use Code 530 (High School), from
Trip Generation was used to calculate the number of vehicular trips the development will generate
during the following time periods: (1) average weekday; (2) weekday A.M. peak hour; and (3)
weekday Afternoon peak hour. Table 4 shows the rates/equations and directional percentages for
the analyzed time periods.

In addition, based ITE trip generation data during the weekday P.M. peak hour (one hour between
4:00-6:00 P.M.), the additional 800 students will generate 104 trips.

TRIP DISTRIBUTION

New Trips
The distribution and assignment of new trips generated by the high school expansion was based
upon an analysis of the following: (1) existing traffic patterns and distributions within the study
area; (2) available routes for travel; and (3) the existing and proposed site driveway locations. A
gravity model analysis was performed using 2010 U.S. Census data to determine the orientation
of traffic to/from the high school. The origins of commuters traveling to the high school located
in Boyertown Borough were determined from the Census data. Travel routes were then
determined to/from each of the surrounding municipalities. Distribution percentages were
calculated for each of the travel routes by determining the percentage of vehicles using each
route to/from the surrounding municipalities. The gravity model information is included in
Appendix E. The new trips for the proposed development were distributed to the local roadway
network based on the percentages shown in Table 6 and the travel patterns at given intersections.

The distribution of the additional site-generated trips are shown in Figures 9 and 10 for the
weekday A.M. and afternoon peak hours.

PROJECTED (BUILD) CONDITION TRAFFIC VOLUMES

The existing site traffic was redistributed to account for the proposed access to Montgomery
Avenue. The site-generated trips for the proposed development and the redistribution due to the
proposed Montgomery Avenue access were added to the 2017 and 2022 base (no-build) condition
traffic volumes to calculate 2017 and 2022 projected (build) condition traffic volumes. Projected
condition traffic volumes are shown in Figures 11 and 12 for the 2017 opening and are shown in
Figures 13 and 14 for the 2022 design years for the weekday A.M., and afternoon peak hours.

Traffic volume development worksheets and schematic figures showing the assignment of site trips
to the study area intersections as percentages of the total trips are contained in Appendix E.

DRIVEWAY CLASSIFICATION

Driveways intersecting state roads are classified in the Pennsylvania Code, Title 67, Chapter 441.
Low volume driveways are used by 25 to 750 vehicles per day. A medium volume driveway is
used by 750 to 1500 vehicles per day. High volume driveways are used by more than 1500
vehicles per day. Based on the anticipated site trip generation and the assignment of site traffic,
the classifications of the site driveways intersecting Montgomery Avenue, the driveway is
anticipated to be classified as low volume (542 vehicles).

LEVELS OF SERVICE FOR AN INTERSECTION

For analysis of intersections, level of service is defined in terms of delay, which is a measure of
driver discomfort and frustration, fuel consumption, and lost travel time. LOS criteria is stated in
terms of control delay per vehicle for a one-hour analysis period. Control delay includes initial


                                                -9-
BOYERTOWN AREA HIGH SCHOOL EXPANSION TRANSPORTATION IMPACT STUDY




deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. The criteria
are shown in Table 7. Delay, as it relates to level of service, is a complex measure and is dependent
upon a number of variables. For signalized intersections, these variables include the quality of
vehicle progression, the cycle length, the green time ratio, and the volume/capacity ratio for the lane
group in question. For unsignalized intersections, delay is related to the availability of gaps in the
flow of traffic on the major street and the driver's discretion in selecting an appropriate gap for a
particular movement from the minor street (straight across, left or right turn).

CAPACITY ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

Capacity analyses were conducted for the weekday A.M. and afternoon peak hours at the study
area intersections. These analyses were conducted according to the methodologies contained in
the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) using Synchro 8 software, a Trafficware product.
The following conditions were analyzed, as applicable:
            Existing conditions;
            2017 Base conditions (Build-out year without development);
            2017 Projected conditions (Build-out year with development);
            2022 Base conditions (Design year without development);
            2022 Projected conditions (Design year with development).

It should be noted that based on methodologies contained in Chapter 10 of PennDOT's
Publication 46, TPD adjusted the following 2010 HCM default values in the Synchro 8 capacity
analysis. These adjustments were made at the signalized intersections within the study area for
all time periods based on the study area location being classified as Suburban:
           Base saturation flow rates for signalized intersections. The saturation flow rate was
           changed from the default value based on Exhibit 10-9.
           Start-up lost time and extension of effective green time for signalized intersections. The
           startup lost time was changed from the default value based on Exhibit 10-10.

In addition, capacity analyses were conducted at the proposed site driveway intersection under the
2017 and 2022 projected conditions. The capacity analysis worksheets are included in Appendix F.
The PennDOT-approved signal plans are included in Appendix G.

PennDOT's Transportation Impact Study Guidelines outlined in Strike-Off Letter 470-09-4,
dated February 12, 2009 contain the following criteria regarding levels of service:
       Page 29 of the Guidelines state that if evaluation of the With Development Horizon Year
       Scenario to the Without Development Horizon Year Scenario indicates that the overall
       intersection level of service has dropped, the applicant will be required to mitigate the
       level of service if the increase in overall intersection delay is greater than 10-seconds. If
       the overall intersection delay increase is less than or equal to 10-seconds, mitigation of
       the intersection will not be required.
       Page 29 of the Guidelines state that for mitigation scenarios, applicants are expected to
       mitigate the overall intersection LOS to the original Without Development LOS; the 10-
       second delay variance is not applied to mitigation scenarios. Applicants may be required
       to address available storage and queue lengths at critical movements or approaches even
       if the overall LOS requirements are met.
       Page 31 of the Guidelines state that if signalization is the preferred alternative for
       mitigation, overall intersection LOS C in rural areas and LOS D in urban areas is
       acceptable.
       Page 31 of the Guidelines states new signalized or unsignalized intersection established
       to serve as access to the development shall be designed to operate at minimum LOS C for
       rural areas, and minimum LOS D for urban areas.

LEVELS OF SERVICE IN THE STUDY AREA

Level of service (LOS) matrices for the study area intersections are shown in Tables 8 and 9 for
the weekday A.M. and afternoon peak hours. Per PennDOT standards, the signal timings at the
signalized study area intersections have been optimized under base conditions and projected
conditions.

As shown in Tables 8 and 9, under projected conditions with the new Montgomery Avenue
access and the additional students, all levels of service at the study area intersection comply with
the requirement outlined in PennDOT's TIS Guidelines. Please note, although the LOS complies
with PennDOT's standards, there are deficient movements at the Reading Avenue intersections
with Montgomery Avenue in Colebrookdale Township. As discussed previously, improvements
are identified at these intersections as part of the Township's Capital Improvement Plan. This
application will be subject to the Township's transportation impact fee and the Township could
apply those funds towards improvements at the intersections.

95TH PERCENTILE QUEUE ANALYSIS

Queue analyses were conducted at the study area intersections using Synchro 8 software for the
2022 design year conditions. For this analysis, the 95th percentile queue is defined as the queue
length that is exceeded in 5% of the signal cycles. As an example, for a signal with a 90-second
cycle, this means that the 95th percentile queue length will be exceeded during 2 of the 40 signal

cycles that occur during the peak hour. The queue analysis results are summarized in Table 10 for
the analyzed peak hours.

AUXILIARY TURN LANE ANALYSIS

Methodology
TPD evaluated auxiliary turn lane warrants at the proposed driveway intersection with
Montgomery Avenue. The warrant analysis was conducted according to the methodologies
contained in Chapter 11 of PennDOT's Publication 46 and Strike-Off Letter 470-08-07.

Findings
Table 11 summarizes the results of the auxiliary turn lane analysis at the site access
intersections.

The calculations for the auxiliary turn lane warrants are included in Appendix H.

RECOMMENDATIONS

TPD has made the following recommendations in relation to the proposed Boyertown Area High
School expansion:
   Construct a westbound Montgomery Avenue left turn lane at the proposed site access;
   Provide a separate left and right turn lane exiting the proposed site access to Montgomery
   Avenue;
   Design the proposed site access to Montgomery Avenue in accordance with PennDOT's
   criteria;
   Contribute to Colebrookdale Township's transportation impact fee.

CONCLUSIONS

Based on the results of the transportation impact study, TPD offers the following conclusions:
   This report has been prepared in accordance with PennDOT's policies. The project scope
   and the extent of the study area were confirmed with representatives of PennDOT,
   Colebrookdale Township and Boyertown Borough at a meeting on January 16, 2014.
   The Boyertown Area High School is located in both Colebrookdale Township and
   Boyertown Borough. The project site is bound by Montgomery Avenue to the north, 4th
   Street to the south, Monroe Street to east and Berks Street to the west. It is TPD's
   understanding that the High School currently serves a total of 1737 students in 10th-12th

   grades. With the proposed expansion, 9th grade students (up to 600 students) will be added.
   In addition, existing space within the School will be reconfigured to accommodate a potential
   200 additional students within any grade.
   The School is currently served by three (3) existing driveways; one to Monroe Street, and
   two to Kehl Street. One new access to Montgomery Avenue (S.R. 2069) is proposed in
   conjunction with the proposed school expansion. In addition, the existing access to Monroe
   Street, opposite 5th Street, will be modified to provide one-way inbound flow only. Vehicles
   currently exiting the school at this location will now use Monroe Street to exit the School.
   With the reprofiling of the on-site embankment the site distances for the proposed access to
   Montgomery Avenue will satisfy the applicable PennDOT criteria.
   Upon full build-out, the proposed development is expected to generate 344 new vehicle-trips
   during the weekday A.M. peak hour and 232 new vehicle-trips during the afternoon peak
   hour.
   Colebrookdale Township's Roadway Sufficiency Analysis and Transportation Capital
   Improvements Plan, dated August 2005, identifies improvements at the following study area
   intersections:
   o North Reading Avenue and Montgomery Avenue;
   o Montgomery Avenue and Reading Avenue/Henry Avenue.
   Under projected conditions with the new Montgomery Avenue access and the additional
   students, all levels of service at the study area intersection comply with the requirement
   outlined in PennDOT's TIS Guidelines.

       transit accommodations): None
3. DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE AND STAGING:
    Anticipated Opening Date: 2016
    Full Build-out Date: 2021
    Proposed Development/Staging: None
4. TRIP GENERATION:
      Trip generation for the proposed development will be based on:
                 ITE Trip Generation Manual.
                Other independent surveys.

For the weekday A.M. Peak Hour, weekday P.M. Peak Hour and daily weekday total trip generation
calculations, ITE land use code #530, pertaining to High School was used. Table 1 shows the
rates/equations and directional percentages for the analyzed time periods.

13. TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT:
   In order to determine the orientation of traffic to/from the High School, TPD evaluated the
   municipalities which are served by the School District, which include the Borough's and
   Township's listed in Table 4 below.

                                  TABLE 4
               MUNICIPALITIES SERVED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
                    Berks County                        Montgomery County
                   Bally Borough                        Douglass Township
                Bechtelsville Borough                  New Hanover Township
                 Boyertown Borough                    Upper Frederick Township
               Colebrookdale Township                             -
                 Douglass Township                                -
                   Earl Township                                  -
                Washington Township                               -

   Based on a review of the 2010 populations of each of the above municipalities, the following
   trip distribution percentages were determined (Table 5).
                                     TABLE 5
                       NEW TRIP DISTRIBUTION PERCENTAGES
             Direction                           Via                     Percentage
             Northwest                   Reading Avenue                     13%
             Northeast                Montgomery Avenue                     12%
                              5th Street, 4th Street, Franklin Street,
             Southwest                                                      25%
                              Jefferson Street, Monroe Street, etc.
                              5th Street, 4th Street, Franklin Street,
             Southeast                                                      50%
                              Jefferson Street, Monroe Street, etc.

   It is anticipated that the majority of the traffic oriented to/from the north will utilize the
   proposed access to Montgomery Avenue and will no longer travel through many of the
   Borough intersections.

   In addition, existing site traffic will be redistributed to account for the new access to
   Montgomery Avenue.

14. APPROVAL OF DATA COLLECTION ELEMENTS AND METHODOLOGIES:
    Manual traffic counts at the study area intersections for the weekday morning (6:30-9:00
    A.M.) and the weekday evening (2:00-6:00 P.M.) peak periods.

15. CAPACITY/LOS ANALYSIS:
    The analyses will be conducted according to the methodologies contained in the 2010 Highway
    Capacity Manual (HCM) using Synchro 8 software.

16. ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS/MODIFICATIONS BY OTHERS TO BE INCLUDED:
    To be confirmed with the Colebrookdale Township and Boyertown Borough.

17. OTHER NEEDED ANALYSES:
    a. Sight Distance Analysis: A sight distance analysis will be performed for the proposed
       Montgomery Avenue site driveway location in accordance with PennDOT Publication
       282 Highway Occupancy Permit Guidelines and compared to PennDOT's desirable sight
       distance standard, which is identified in 67 PA Code Chapter 441.8(h), "Access to and
       Occupancy of Highways by Driveways and Local Roads." In addition, measured sight
       distances at the proposed driveways will be compared to PennDOT's safe stopping sight
       distance standard.
   b. Signal Warrant Analysis: Where applicable, a signal warrant analysis will be prepared
      for any unsignalized intersections that operate at poor levels of service
   c. Required Signal Phasing/Timing Modifications: TBD
   d. Traffic Signal Corridor/Network Analysis: N/A
   e. Analysis of the Need for Turning Lanes: The TIS will include auxiliary turn lane warrant
      analysis at the proposed site driveway. The warrant analysis methodology contained
      within Chapter 11 of PennDOT's Publication 46 and Strike-Off Letter 470-08-07 will be
      utilized for this analysis.
       A preliminary left turn lane warrant analysis has been prepared utilizing traffic volumes
       collected along Montgomery Avenue and methodologies outlined in this scoping
       application. Based on the preliminary analysis, warrants for a left turn lane are not
       satisfied. The preliminary volumes and left turn lane warrant analysis are attached.
   f. Turning Lane Lengths: The analysis methodology contained within Chapter 11 of
      PennDOT's Publication 46 and Strike-Off Letter 470-08-07 will be utilized for this
      analysis.
    g. Left Turn Signal Phasing Analysis: TPD will analyze left turn signal phasing only where
       signal phasing changes are proposed (please see 17.c. ­ Required Signal Phasing/Timing
       Modifications for more information).
    h. Queuing Analysis: TPD will analyze the 95th percentile queue lengths for all approaches
       of the study area signalized intersections and proposed driveways during the Base and
       Projected conditions. This analysis will be completed using Synchro 8 software which is
       based on the methodologies contained in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM).

      j. Crash Analysis: TPD will conduct and submit a crash analysis under separate cover that
         will contain an analysis of reportable crashes along Montgomery Avenue in vicinity of
         the proposed site access. A reportable crash shall be defined as a crash where fatality
         occurs and/or a vehicle is towed from the scene of the crash.
      k. Weaving Analysis: None
      l. Other Required Studies: None

Subject:                          RE: Boyertown High School


Good Afternoon Glenn,

       As a follow-up to my voice mail, we have reviewed the scoping application for Boyertown High School Expansion
(PRE51193) and offer the following comments:

    1. The TIS scoping meeting should be scheduled to coincide with the beginning or end of the school day so that
       patterns in drop-off/pick-up, student vehicles, and bus routes can be observed.
    2. The turning movement counts should be conducted on days when school is in session.
    3. The weekday PM peak count period should be clarified. It is listed as 2:00-6:00 in section 10 and 2:30-6:00 in
       section 14.
    4. More details of the process used to determine the distribution in section 13 should be provided along with
       diagrams showing the existing and proposed traffic distributions, and descriptions of existing and proposed bus
       traffic patterns. This must be provided prior to the TIS scoping field view.
    5. The left turn warrant should be performed in greater detail with actual volumes and heavy vehicle percentages,
       including adjustment for proposed buses.
    6. In Section 17.j the definition of a reportable crash should be corrected to read injury instead of fatality.
    7. The Department will discuss concerns with the proposed improvements at the Scoping Meeting in accordance
       with Strike-Off Letter 470-09-04. Please note that it is the applicant's responsibility to invite the appropriate
       parties (including municipal representatives, as well as other agencies such as local transit authorities, MPOs or
       RPOs if required). The applicant is responsible for developing meeting minutes and distributing them to
       attendees within 7 business days of the meeting.

        With regards to #1 and my voicemail, we can tentatively plan for Thursday Jan. 16th at 1:30/2:00pm, I am
waiting on confirmation regarding another meeting that morning in Union Township. Due to our schedules this would
be the preferred date. If this date does not work please let me know and we can look for an alternative day. Thanks.

Hi Brian,

I think the scoping application you requested was submitted to you by Guy DiMartino last week. Just wondering if we
can schedule a date for a field meeting yet?

Brian,

Attached is an aerial of Boyertown High School and a concept plan of the Monroe Street extension to Montgomery that
we propose. The pdf version is a 21 mb file so I just made this jpg. If you would like a pdf I can send a link file you can
download. I have advised Guy DiMartino of our conversation this morning. Please copy him with any correspondence
to me.

Thanks,

Discussion:

   1.   Brian Boyer explained the purpose of the meeting, for PennDOT to see the circumstances of
        the driveway and stakeholders to have opportunity to meet and discuss.
   2.   Glenn Harris discussed the proposed layout, an extension of existing Monroe Street, re-
        configuring existing parking areas and providing a controlled, gated entrance/exit onto
        Montgomery Ave. The driveway would be utilized by cars and busses during school opening
        and closing time and for certain event functions like baseball games at the discretion of
        BASD.

                                          develop the future.

3.    Thomas Walter stated that any gate controls would have to be set back for large vehicles to
      have room to enter the site and stop if the gate were not open.
4.    A primary concern of PennDOT at the actual location proposed is whether a left turn lane on
      Montgomery into the driveway is warranted. Guy DiMartino indicated that preliminary
      figures indicate it is not warranted.
5.    PennDOT officials stated that an 8' shoulder would be needed for a minimum of 100' each
      side of the driveway if a turn lane was not provided. Guy noted there would be
      complications of gore striping relative to neighbor's driveways if a left turn lane were used.
6.    The driveway would be used by approximately 25 busses in and out plus cars, primarily
      student access to their designated parking area. Guy has forwarded figures of preliminary
      trip distribution percentages to PennDOT for their review.
7.    Utility poles existing on Montgomery were noted as needing to be moved for the shoulder
      requirement.
8.    Sight distance had been approximated by RDG prior to the meeting. 365' was visible to the
      right (southeast) and more than the recommended 675' to the left (northwest). The speed is
      posted at 35mph. Other PennDOT tables may be employed to required sight distance. The
      sight distance to the right is influenced by a hump in the road in combination with a curve
      and side slope embankment. Evaluations of the sight distance will be required. PennDOT
      officials requested the entrance location be staked and they will return next week to measure
      with their staff.
9.    Questions were asked regarding requirements for a 15 mph zone. The only requirement
      PennDOT has is there must be at least one walker utilizing the road. Sidewalks do not exist in
      this region of the township so the school will not allow or encourage walkers from this area.
      So a limited speed zone will not apply.
10.   PennDOT may require pork chop island to separate the exiting left and right turn lanes on the
      driveway approach to Montgomery Avenue. A preliminary design must be submitted for
      further evaluation.
11.   RDG intends to start the land development process with a submission to both municipalities
      next week. That submission will include and initial design for the review and comment from
      both municipal engineers. Submission of HOP permit application to PennDOT will follow
      when initial design comments have been addressed and a traffic study is completed by TPD.
12.   Traffic counts by TPD will be conducted in the near future for the intersections identified in
      the scoping application. Dan Coghlan provided a list of potential additional intersections
      Boyertown Borough was interested in. Guy will discuss with Dan.
13.   Amy requested the traffic counts capture approximately ½ hour before the start times for
      school. School begins at 7:30 and releases at 2:45.
14.   PennDOT, TPD and Gilmore agreed that the traffic counts be performed from 6:30-8:30 AM,
      and 2:15-6:00 PM. While the traffic counts will include the 4-6 PM period, all parties agreed
      that a "system peak" will be evaluated in the afternoon. This "system peak" will be
      determined by calculating the peak hour of the existing High School based on counts at the

       driveways. The "system peak" hour is anticipated to occur sometime between 2:15-4:00 PM.
       No peak hour evaluation for the 4-6 PM period will be completed in the TIS.
   15. A discussion was held about the meaning of Colebrookdale Township's Act 209 study as it
       relates to off site improvements. Guy explained that certain improvements are identified for
       various intersections in the Act 209 study. A formula is applied to a developer's possible
       contribution of cost of these improvements based on traffic trips generated by the project.
   16. PennDOT was asked to comment on the use of Act 209 funds to improvements. They
       responded that when an intersection is degraded by traffic generated by the project they
       generally look to have improvements performed rather than go into a fund for future
       improvement.
   17. Anticipated time frame for traffic study preparation was discussed following the meeting.
       Since a February 20 Planning Commission meeting is anticipated, TPD will seek to have the
       traffic study completed in advance of that date so that discussion can include certain facts
       from the traffic study.

Subject: Boyertown HS TIS intersections

Hello Guy ­

After reviewing the area around the HS we would like the following intersections included in your TIS:

4th and Madison
4th and Monroe
4th and Washington
7th and Reading
Philadelphia and Madison
Philadelphia and Monroe
Philadelphia and Jefferson
Philadelphia and Washington

This represents more locations than I originally thought we would end up with, but given the tight grid configuration out
there, these intersections all look to have significant school traffic and we would like to see how they are operating.

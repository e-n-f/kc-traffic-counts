Executive Summary
This Traffic Impact & Access Study has been prepared to evaluate the potential impacts
associated with the proposed senior residential housing at 215 High Street in Westwood,
Massachusetts. The proposed facility calls for the construction of an 82 residential units. These
units will be restricted to residents aged 55 and older. The proposed senior residential housing
will replace the existing land uses currently on the project site, which include a horse stable and
a rare tree nursery and landscaping business. A new driveway will be constructed to serve the
residences, in approximately the same location as the existing driveway at 215 High Street.
This study includes a review of the existing traffic and roadway conditions in the vicinity of the
project site, as well as a review of the accident history at each study intersection. This study
identifies background growth for the local roadway network, estimates the additional vehicular
traffic generated the proposed development project, and evaluates the expected future
roadway and intersection operations, both with and without the proposed development project
in place.

Summary of Results
        Based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) methodology, the proposed
        development project is expected to generate 16 vehicles-trips during the weekday
        morning peak hour (5 entering, 11 exiting), and 21 vehicle-trips during the weekday
        afternoon peak hour (11 entering, and 10 exiting). Over the course of a typical
        weekday, the proposed facility is expected to generate approximately 282 vehicle-trips.
        During the Saturday midday peak hour, the proposed facility is expected to generate 25
        vehicle-trips, and on a typical Saturday, a total of approximately 214 vehicle-trips are
        expected.
        The existing crash rate at each study intersection is below the MassDOT District 6 and
        statewide averages.
        Drivers exiting the proposed site drive onto High Street are expected to have sufficient
        sight distance for safe vehicle operations.
        There are sufficient gaps in the traffic flow on High Street to allow vehicles to safely exit
        the proposed driveway.
        The intersection capacity analyses conducted at each study intersection indicate that
        the project-generated traffic is not expected to have any significant impacts on the
        intersection and roadway operations.
This study indicates that the existing roadway network can accommodate the additional
vehicular traffic generated by the proposed development project, with minimal impacts on
traffic operations.

1. Introduction
Design Consultants, Inc. (DCI) has prepared this traffic impact and access study to evaluate the
potential impacts on the local transportation network associated with the proposed
development project at 215 High Street in Westwood. CRP Development, LLC is proposing to
construct 82 units of senior residential housing. The proposed development project will replace
the existing uses of the project site, which include a horse stable and a rare tree nursery and
landscaping business. This study closely follows the requirements of the Town of Westwood
Planning Board's Rules and Regulations for Senior Residential Development (adopted February
21, 2006), and includes a review of the existing traffic and roadway conditions in the vicinity of
the project site, identifies background traffic growth for the study area, estimates additional
traffic generated by the proposed development project, and evaluates the future traffic
operations at the proposed site driveway and at nearby study intersections.


2. Existing Conditions

Project Site
The project site is served by a single curb cut on the north side of High Street (Route 109). The
existing driveway is approximately 1,000 feet east of the High Street / Summer Street
intersection and approximately 750 feet west of the High Street / Lowder Brook Drive
intersection.

Study Area
A field inventory of the adjacent roadway system was conducted in May and June of 2013. This
inventory included a collection of existing roadway geometry, traffic control, and traffic volumes
for the roadways and intersections in the vicinity of the project site.
The following study intersections are included in this report:
        High Street (Route 109) / Summer Street
        High Street (Route 109) / 215 High Street Driveway
        High Street (Route 109) / Lowder Brook Drive
Figure 1 shows the project site in relation to the larger transportation network.

High Street (Route 109)
High Street (Route 109) generally runs in a northeast-southwest direction through the Town of
Westwood, from the Walpole town line its western end to the Dedham town line at its eastern
end. Route 109 provides regional access to Route 128 / I-95 near the Westwood / Dedham
town line. High Street generally provides a single travel lane in each direction, with dedicated
turning lanes at larger intersections. In the area of the project, 5-foot cement concrete sidewalk
is provided along the northern side of High Street. The posted speed limit on High Street is 30
MPH in both directions in the vicinity of the project site. The existing land use on High Street is
primarily residential in nature.




             High Street (Route 109), in the vicinity of the project site, looking west


High Street (Route 109) / Summer Street
The High Street (Route 109) / Summer Street intersection, also known as "Irving A. Peavey
Square", is a three-legged T-intersection controlled by a traffic signal. The High Street
northeast-bound approach provides two travel lanes: a shared through/left-turn lane and a
second through lane. The two travel lanes are provided for a distance of approximately 125
feet. The High Street southwest-bound approach provides two travel lanes, a single through
lane and an exclusive right-turn lane. This right turn-lane is striped for a distance of
approximately 90 feet. The Summer Street southeast-bound approach provides an exclusive
left-turn lane and an exclusive right-turn lane. The Summer Street approach is striped as these
two travel lanes for a distance of approximately 55 feet. All traffic movements are controlled


                                                                                     October 2013

with a traffic signal, and a left-turn arrow is provided for the High Street northeast-bound left-
turning movement. There are pedestrian crosswalks across Summer Street, and across the
southwest leg of High Street. However, it is noted that the sidewalk on the southeast side of
High Street is only provided for a very short distance, and does not continue in either direction
beyond the intersection. Conversely, the sidewalk on the northwest side of High Street is
continues in both directions beyond the immediate area of the intersection. An exclusive
pedestrian phase allows pedestrians to safely cross either crosswalk without any vehicular
conflicts.
High Street (Route 109) / Lowder Brook Drive
Lowder Brook Drive intersects High Street to form a three-legged T-intersection. The High
Street eastbound approach provides two through travel lanes and a channelized exclusive right-
turn lane. The exclusive right-turn lane is provided for a distance of approximately 200 feet,
while the two through lanes are provided for approximately 240 feet. The High Street
eastbound channelized right-turn lane is under YIELD control. The High Street westbound
approach provides two through travel lanes, and an exclusive left-turn lane. The exclusive left-
turn lane is provided for approximately 370 feet. The Lowder Brook Drive northbound approach
provides an exclusive left-turn lane and a channelized right-turn lane. The Lowder Brook Drive
northbound channelized right-turn lane is a free movement, with its own receiving lane (which
then merges back into the two eastbound travel lanes on High Street approximately 130 feet
downstream of the intersection. A sidewalk is provided along the north side of High Street but
there are no crosswalks at this intersection, nor are there any pedestrian signal indications.


3. Traffic Volumes
Manual turning movement counts (TMC's) were collected at all study intersections during the
weekday morning peak period (7-9am), the weekday afternoon peak period (4-6pm), and during
the Saturday midday peak period (11am-1pm). The TMC data included all vehicular traffic,
bicycles, and pedestrians, and were collected on Saturday, May 18, 2013 and on Tuesday, May
21, 2013.
In addition to the manual TMC's that were collected at each study intersection, an automatic
traffic recorder (ATR) collected traffic data on High Street in the vicinity of the project site
driveway. The ATR collected traffic volume data, vehicular speed data, vehicle classification
data, and the length of gaps in between vehicles. These data were collected over a 48-hour
period on Tuesday, May 21 and Wednesday May 22, 2013.
The most recent weekday seasonal adjustment factors from MassDOT were consulted, but no
seasonal adjustments were required. The MassDOT seasonal adjustment data indicate that
traffic volumes collected in the month of May are generally above average.
The ATR data collected on High Street are summarized on Table 1.

As indicated on Table 1, the average weekday daily traffic on High Street is approximately
23,000 vehicles. The 85th percentile speed, defined as the speed at or below which 85% of the
vehicles are travelling, ranges from 39 MPH to 46 MPH, depending on time of day and direction
travelled. Throughout an average weekday, the 85th percentile speed is 41 MPH and 44 MPH in
the eastbound and westbound directions, respectively.
The existing weekday morning and afternoon peak hour TMC traffic volumes are displayed on
Figures 2 and 3, respectively. The existing Saturday midday peak hour traffic volumes are
displayed on Figure 4. The complete traffic count data are provided in Appendix A.

4. Safety Analysis
To identify vehicle crash trends at the study intersections, accident data was obtained from
MassDOT for the three latest years on record, 2008 ­ 2010. Crash rates for intersections are
calculated based upon the number of crashes at an intersection and the volume of traffic
travelling through an intersection on a daily basis. The MassDOT average crash rates are based
upon the average number of crashes occurring per million vehicles entering signalized and
unsignalized intersections. The average crash rates for MassDOT District 6 (which includes the
Town of Westwood) are 0.76 and 0.58 for signalized and unsignalized intersections, respectively.
The MassDOT statewide average crash rates are 0.80 and 0.60 for signalized and unsignalized
intersections, respectively. The crash data for all study intersections are summarized in Table 2.

5. Future Conditions

Future Traffic Volumes
Future traffic volume projections have been made for two future years: the anticipated year of
opening (2015), and five years beyond the anticipated year of opening (2020). Future traffic
volume projections typically consist of the application of a general background growth rate, and
the addition of trips generated by specific planned development projects. Discussions with
Westwood Town Planner indicated that while there are some planned development projects
along High Street, none are in the immediate vicinity of the project site at 215 High Street, and
there are no available previous traffic studies that have been completely recently that include
this report's study intersections.
The May 2013 traffic volume data on High Street were compared with previous data to
understand the growth that has been experience on High Street. This comparison can help
determine an appropriate background growth rate for the future traffic volume comparison.
The historical traffic data that was used for these comparisons include daily traffic volumes on
High Street from MassDOT (2007) and peak hour intersection volumes from the Route 109
Corridor Planning Study, published by the Central Transportation Planning Staff (CTPS) in March
2003. Table 3 summarizes the results of these comparisons.

As indicated in Table 3 above, the average daily traffic volumes have decreased by over 1% per
year for the past six years. The peak hour traffic volumes have, on average, decreased between
0.65 and 1.15% over the past 11 years.
However, in order to conform to Town of Westwood Planning Board's Rules and Regulations for
Senior Residential Development (adopted February 21, 2006), a 4% annual background growth
rate was used to develop the future traffic volume projections. This 4% annual background

                                                                                               October 2013

growth rate is significantly higher than the actual growth that the roadways and intersections
have experienced recently, and is significantly higher than the background growth rates used in
other recent traffic studies for the Town of Westwood (for example, the Traffic Impact
Assessment ­ Colburn School Reuse ­ Westwood, Massachusetts, prepared by Vanasse &
Associates, Inc. on January 30, 2012 used a 1% annual background growth rate). As the 4%
annual background growth rate is unlikely to be realized, the future traffic volume projections
presented in this report are very conservative and represent a "worst case" scenario. The
resultant year 2015 Future No-Build peak hour traffic volumes are displayed in Figures 5-7. The
year 2020 Future No-Build peak hour traffic volumes are displayed in Figures 8-10.

Project-Generated Vehicle-Trips
To estimate the trip generation characteristics of the proposed development project, the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (9th edition, 2012) was used.
This manual provides vehicle-trip generation projections for various land-uses, based on
research and data conducted by public agencies, developers, consulting firms, and professional
associations. The trips generated by the proposed project were estimated through the use of
the trip generation rates for ITE Land Use 252 ­ Senior Adult Housing (Attached).
Table 4 summarizes the proposed trip generation for this development project. Complete trip
generation calculations are provided in Appendix C.

As indicated in Table 4, the proposed development project is expected to generate a total of 16
vehicle-trips during the weekday morning peak hour, 21 vehicle-trips during the weekday
afternoon peak hour, and 282 vehicle-trips over the course of a typical weekday. During the
Saturday midday peak hour, approximately 25 vehicle-trips are expected to be generated, with
approximately 214 vehicle-trips throughout a typical Saturday.
The project-generated vehicle trips, shown in Table 4, were then distributed onto the roadway
network, using existing travel patterns. The trip distribution patterns used to apply the new
vehicle-trips to the roadway network is displayed in Figures 11 and 12. The new site-generated
vehicle trips are displayed in Figures 13-15, and the 2015 and 2020 Future Build Peak Hour
traffic volumes are shown in Figure 16-21.

Site Access
A new two-way 24-foot wide site driveway is proposed on High Street, in approximately the
same location as the existing driveway at 215 High Street. At its intersection with High Street, a
wide median is proposed to separate the entering and exiting traffic. In the area of this median,
the driveway will consist of a single 14-foot wide travel lane in each direction. For reference,
the proposed site plan prepared by DeCelle-Burke & Associates, is shown in the figure below.




                                       Proposed Site Plan



Sight Distance
The sight distance was measured at the proposed driveway on High Street in order to determine
whether exiting vehicles would have adequate sight distance to safely enter High Street. The
required sight distance is a function of perception/reaction time of the approaching motorist
and the required braking distance, which is based on vehicular speed. The available sight
distance at the proposed driveway was recorded in conformance with the procedures
established in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (6th ed., 2011). The available sight
distance was then compared to the minimum requirements for two sight distance criteria:
Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) and Intersection Sight Distance (ISD).
SSD is the distance required for vehicles on the major road to stop in time to avoid a collision
with a stationary object. The SSD was recorded from the edge of the travel way on High Street.

                                                                                  October 2013

This is the point at which an object becomes an obstruction to a moving vehicle. ISD is the
distance needed for a vehicle to enter the major roadway from the minor roadway without
interfering with traffic operations on the major roadway. ISD is often desirable to improve
traffic operations and to provide convenience for vehicles exiting the minor roadway, but it is
not required. In accordance with the procedure stated in the AASHTO A Policy on Geometric
Design of Highways and Streets, the ISD was recorded 15 feet back from the edge of the travel
way on High Street. This point forms one vertex of the "clear sight triangle". The sight triangle
is the area that must be clear from obstructions to provide sufficient ISD for a stopped driver on
a minor road approach to depart from the intersection and enter the major roadway.
While the posted speed limit on High Street is 30 MPH in both directions, the 85th percentile
speed of vehicles traveling on High Street was used to evaluate the sight distance at the
driveway. The recorded 85th percentile speeds on High Street are 41 MPH and 44 MPH in the
eastbound and westbound directions, respectively. Table 5 compares the available sight
distance at the proposed site driveway location, as recorded in the field, to the minimum
requirements for SSD and ISD.

 Stopping Sight Distance                                   Measured            Minimum Required

 Vehicles on High Street traveling westbound                630 ft                  350 ft (2)

 (1)   Values based on AASHTO requirements for 41 MPH
 (2)   Values based on AASHTO requirements for 44 MPH



As shown in Table 5, the minimum sight distance requirements for SSD are exceeded in both
directions. The desirable distances for ISD are also exceeded in both directions. Based on this
analysis, there are no anticipated sight distance issues at the proposed driveway location.



Gap Acceptance Analysis
As mentioned previously, the ATR on High Street also recorded the length of time between
vehicles, in addition to recording the vehicular volumes and speeds. Typical values for "time gap
acceptance" for vehicles departing a minor roadway and entering a major roadway are given in
the AASHTO A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. In the case of vehicles
turning left from a minor road, a typical acceptable gap for a passenger vehicle is 7.5 seconds.
For a vehicle turning right from a minor road, a typical acceptable gap for a passenger vehicle is
6.5 seconds. These values for acceptable gap times are consistent with the ISD calculations in
the previous section, and would allow for most major road drivers to not reduce their travel
speed to less than 70% of their initial speed. For vehicles wishing to turn left from the site
driveway, the number of "combined gaps" were evaluated (i.e. the number and length of gaps in


                                                                                   October 2013

the traffic flow that occur in both directions simultaneously). For vehicles wishing to turn right
from the site drive, only the number/length of gaps in the westbound traffic on High Street were
evaluated. Table 6 summarizes the results of this gap acceptance analysis for vehicles exiting
the project site.

As indicated in Table 6, there are more than sufficient number of gaps in the flow of traffic on
High Street during the weekday peak periods to safely allow vehicles to exit the site driveway
onto High Street. The complete gap data reports are included with the traffic count data in
Appendix A.

Intersection Capacity Analysis
To assess quality of traffic flow, intersection capacity analyses were conducted for the study
intersections for the following five scenarios:
           2013 Existing Conditions
           2015 (anticipated year of opening) No-Build Conditions
           2020 (5 years beyond anticipated year of opening) No-Build Conditions
           2015 (anticipated year of opening) Build Conditions
           2020 (5 years beyond anticipated year of opening) Build Conditions
Within each scenario, analyses were conducted for the weekday morning peak hour, the
weekday afternoon peak hour, and the Saturday midday peak hour. The intersection capacity
analyses determines vehicular delays, vehicular queuing, and intersection capacity based on the
intersection geometry, traffic signal timing and phasing, and vehicular volumes.
"Level of Service" is used to denote the different operating conditions for roadways and
intersections under various traffic volume loads. LOS designations range from "A" at best with
little or no delays to "F" at worst with long delays and forced flow conditions. LOS ratings for an
intersection are based upon the average delay per approaching vehicle.
Definitions of Levels of Service at signalized and unsignalized intersections are defined in the
2010 Highway Capacity Manual. The following tables summarize the relationship between Level
of Service, delay, and qualitative traffic flow. It is noted that the delay thresholds in the table
below correspond with a volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio of less than 1.0. For any v/c ratio of
greater than 1.0, a LOS F is assigned, regardless of the vehicular delay.

The delay thresholds that define LOS at unsignalized intersections differ from those at signalized
intersections, primarily due to different driver expectations. At unsignalized intersections, the
LOS is not defined for the intersection as a whole, as a high volume of vehicles on the major
roadway typically experience no delay, and would heavily skew any weighted average of delays.
Similar to the thresholds for signalized intersections, the delay thresholds in the table below
correspond with a volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio of less than 1.0. For any v/c ratio of greater
than 1.0, a LOS F is assigned, regardless of the vehicular delay.

As indicated in Tables 9-14, the addition of the project-generated vehicle-trips to the roadway
network results in an overall incremental delay of 0.5 seconds or less at either signalized
intersection, under either the 2015 or 2020 future years, and during any of the three peak hours
that were analyzed. For any specific lane group at either signalized intersection, the incremental
increase in delay is 1.0 seconds or less under either the 2015 or 2020 future years, and during
any of the three peak hours that were analyzed. The incremental increase in the 95th percentile
vehicular queuing for any movement at either signalized intersection is 8 feet or less (i.e. less
than half a car length) under either the 2015 or 2020 future years, and during any of the three
peak hours that were analyzed.
The results of these intersection capacity analysis indicate that the proposed project will have a
negligible impact on traffic operations at the surrounding intersections.

6. Conclusion
The various traffic operation and safety analyses that have been included in this report all
indicate that the proposed 82 units of senior residential housing at 215 High Street will have
minimal impacts to the surrounding roadways and intersections.
Each of the study intersections experience a crash rate below the MassDOT District 6 average,
and the proposed project is not expected to exacerbate any existing safety conditions.
The location of the proposed driveway on High Street will have sufficient sight distance for
vehicles to safely exit the project site, and there are more than sufficient gaps in the traffic flow
on High Street to accommodate the proposed project.
Lastly, the intersection capacity analyses indicates that the additional vehicle-trips that are
expected to be generated by the project site can easily be accommodated by the existing
transportation infrastructure, with minimal impacts on traffic operations. This finding is
consistent for each analysis period, including the weekday morning peak hour, the weekday
afternoon peak hour, and the Saturday midday peak hour.

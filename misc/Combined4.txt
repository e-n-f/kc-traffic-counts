Executive Summary

This Traffic Impact and Access Study (TIAS) has been performed for a proposed hotel and
restaurant at 369-371 Beacon Street in Somerville, Massachusetts, a site currently occupied by a
gas station and auto repair shop. The study was conducted to evaluate the impact of the
redevelopment on the surrounding roadway network. The study provides detailed information,
including study methodology, field observations, and findings.

In summary, existing traffic volumes were recorded in December of 2008. However, the traffic
volumes collected were lower than data collected in 1998; possibly due to Somerville Avenue
construction. Therefore, the 1998 data was grown for ten years to establish the existing 2008
traffic volumes. The volumes were projected five years into the future in conformance with the
traffic study guidelines Executive Office of Transportation & Public Works (EOTPW) and
Executive Office of Environmental & Energy Affairs (EOEEA). Traffic analyses were
performed and comparisons were made between existing conditions, no-build conditions (existing
conditions projected to design year) and the build conditions (no-build conditions with the
addition of site trips) for the following intersections:

·   Somerville Avenue at Beacon Street/ Mossland Street/ Adelaide Road (signalized);
·   Beacon Street at Oxford Street (unsignalized);
·   Beacon Street at Roseland Street (unsignalized); and
·   Beacon Street at Site Drive (unsignalized)

The number of trips generated by the new use is a nominal amount as compared to the trips
associated with the existing permitted use, a gas station. Using industry accepted trip generation
values for this type of development, it is clear that the impact on surrounding streets is negligible
during the peak hours. The proposed project is expected to attract only 11 net new vehicles
during the morning peak hour and 12 net new vehicles in the evening peak hour; approximately
one new vehicle every five minutes.

Using a conservative approach, the signalized and the unsignalized intersections will operate at
the same LOS with or without the project. According to the crash history, safety has not been an
issue at the study area intersections. Based on these findings, the proposed project will have a
negligible impact, if any, on the transportation network surrounding the project during the peak
hours.

Finally, the proposed driveway is situated at the southern end of the site, which provides the
greatest distance between the driveway and the intersection of Somerville Avenue at Beacon
Street. This is the ideal driveway location to minimize the impact of the development on the
roadway network.

1.0 Introduction

The subject property is an approximately 9,670 square feet lot located at 369-371 Beacon Street
in Somerville, Massachusetts (Figure 1). Although no longer in operation, occupying the lot is a
gas station with a small ancillary single-story building that houses an office/retail storefront and a
mechanic's bay. It is the applicant's intention to demolish and remove the existing building and
service pumps and in their place construct a new hotel building with 35 guestrooms and a 60 seat
restaurant. An underground parking structure on the lot would provide 28 parking spaces.

Currently, vehicular access to the site is provided from Beacon Street, an urban arterial with one
travel lane in each direction. Vehicles entering or exiting the site do so via existing curb cuts on
Beacon Street. Vehicular access to the proposed underground parking at the hotel would also be
from Beacon Street, where a driveway ramp capable of accommodating two-way traffic would be
located.

2.0     Scope

Traffic Solutions, LLC has compiled and analyzed traffic data to evaluate the potential effect of
the project on the surrounding roadway network. This Traffic Impact and Access Study (TIAS)
includes a substantive evaluation of the overall operations, safety as well and potential traffic
impacts of the project.

Traffic Solutions, LLC, has analyzed the existing intersection capacity at locations that were
identified through conversations with the City Traffic Engineer. The capacity analyses include
the level of service, volume-to-capacity ratio, 50th percentile queue (i.e., average), and 95th
percentile queue for all time periods. Data were collected and analyzed to ensure that the project
will not have significant negative impacts on area intersections, or on the surrounding roadway
network.

2.1     Methodology and LOS Criteria

This TIAS presents the traffic related data collected, analysis methods, and results for the
proposed hotel project.        The methodology comports with standard approaches and
recommendations as identified by the traffic study guidelines published by the Executive Office
of Transportation & Public Works (EOTPW) and Executive Office of Environmental & Energy
Affairs (EOEEA), and the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) recommended practices.
Once all of the data were collected and processed, a capacity analysis was performed on all of the
study area intersections, and a level of service (LOS) was calculated for each intersection
identified by the City Engineer.

LOS is a term used to describe the quality of the traffic flow on a roadway facility at a particular
point in time. It is an aggregate measure of travel delay, travel speed, congestion, driver
discomfort, convenience, and safety based on a comparison of roadway system capacity to
roadway system travel demand. Operating levels of service are reported on a scale from A to F,
with A representing the best operating conditions and F representing the worst operating
conditions (TABLE 1). Depending on the type of facility being analyzed, LOS A represents free-
flow or uncongested conditions with little or no delay to motorists, while LOS F represents a
forced-flow condition with long delays and traffic demands exceeding roadway capacity.

LOS D is often cited as the design standard for suburban roadways. However, when trying to
establish minimum "acceptable" LOS thresholds for existing roadways a number of factors must
be considered. These include existing operating levels of service on other similar and nearby
facilities, the duration of the peak traffic periods, the feasibility and cost of providing traffic
mitigation, and applicable state and local regulations.

2.2      Study Area

The scope for this TIAS was established by the City Traffic Engineer and includes one traffic
signal (including two intersections) and three unsignalized intersections (Figure 2), one of which
is the proposed site drive to the underground parking area at the hotel. The three intersections
studied are:

·     Somerville Avenue at Beacon Street/Adelaide Road and Somerville Avenue at Mossland
      Street (signalized);
·     Beacon Street at Oxford Street (unsignalized);
·     Beacon Street at Roseland Street (unsignalized); and
·     Beacon Street at Site Drive (unsignalized)

3.0     Existing Conditions Inventory


3.1     Description of Roadways

Five streets are located within the scope of this TIAS and are all in the immediate vicinity of the
proposed hotel. Data were recorded for each of these five roadways.

Somerville Avenue

Originating at the Somerville/Cambridge City Line in the Porter Square neighborhood of
Cambridge, Somerville Avenue has one travel lane in each direction and runs roughly in an east
west direction for 1.3 miles before terminating in the heart of Somerville's Union Square. One of
Somerville's urban principal arterials, the Avenue is presently undergoing a major roadway
reconstruction project that is scheduled for completion in 2010. Sidewalks are located on each of
Somerville Avenue throughout its entire length, while the Avenue is bordered primarily by a mix
of residential and retail uses.

Somerville Avenue runs just north of the project site and intersects with Beacon Street
approximately 100 feet from the proposed hotel. A fully-actuated traffic signal will control both
Somerville Avenue at Beacon Street and the nearby intersection of Somerville Avenue and
Mossland Street. Both intersections have been controlled by the same controller prior to and
during construction. Somerville Avenue has a speed limit of 30 mph where it intersects with
Beacon Street. On-street parking is permitted on both sides of Somerville Avenue at various
locations.

Beacon Street

Originating about 100 feet north of the project site at its intersection with Somerville Avenue,
Beacon Street has one travel lane in each direction and runs roughly North to South for 1.1 miles
to the Cambridge City Line, where it becomes Hampshire Street. A heavily travelled urban
principal arterial, Beacon Street is also scheduled for major reconstruction throughout its length,
with work anticipated to commence sometime in 2011. Sidewalks are located on each of Beacon
Street throughout its entire length, while the Street is bordered primarily by a mix of residential
and retail uses.

With direct frontage on Beacon Street, two existing curb cuts provide for vehicular access to the
project site. The proposal would eliminate one of these existing cub cuts and realign the other,
moving it as far from the intersection with Somerville Avenue as possible. On-street parking is
permitted on both sides of Beacon Street at various locations, though not immediately in front of
the subject property. Beacon Street has a speed limit of 30 mph.

Mossland Street

Mossland Street in Somerville is a short one-way street that connects Elm Street through to
Somerville Avenue. It is essentially an extension of Cedar Street. A fully-actuated signal at its
intersection with Somerville Avenue will exist once the State's Somerville Avenue roadway
reconstruction is complete. As stated above, the signal controls both Somerville Avenue at
Mossland Street and Somerville Avenue at Beacon Street. Mossland Street has sidewalks on both
sides and is bordered exclusively by one-, two-, and multi-family homes. On-street parking is
permitted on both sides of the Street except near the intersection of Somerville Avenue where

                                              Traffic Impact and Access Study, Beacon Street Hotel, Somerville, MA



parking is restricted to provide two storage lanes. There is no posted speed limit on Mossland
Street.

Adelaide Road

Adelaide Road is one leg of a four-legged signalized intersection, with Beacon Street and
Somerville Avenue (two legs) being the others. A short, dead-end private way, Adelaide Road
services solely as an access drive to and from four multi-family apartment buildings. There are
no sidewalks on Adelaide Road and the road is not formally laid out, with an absence of
pavement markings and an informal surface parking arrangement present on both sides of the
street. Adelaide Road has no posted speed limit.

Oxford Street

Oxford Street, which is almost entirely in the city of Cambridge, has sidewalks on both sides and
is bordered almost exclusively by residential properties. On-street parking is permitted on both
sides of Oxford Street and the street has a speed limit of 25 mph. Oxford Street, which has one
travel lane in each direction, runs north-south parallel to Massachusetts Avenue connecting
Kirkland Street in the Harvard University campus to Beacon Street in Somerville. The
Cambridge-Somerville City Line runs almost through the unsignalized intersection of Oxford
Street and Beacon Street, which is located directly opposite the southern end of the subject
property.

Roseland Street

Roseland Street, a one way-street which is almost entirely in the city of Cambridge, has sidewalks
on both sides and is bordered almost exclusively by residential properties. On-street parking is
permitted on both sides of Roseland Street and the street is assumed to have a speed limit of 30
mph since it is not posted. Roseland Street, which has one travel lane in the westbound direction,
runs exclusively east to west connecting Beacon Street in Somerville to Massachusetts Avenue in
Cambridge. The Cambridge-Somerville City Line on Roseland Street is just west of Beacon
Street. Roseland Street is located directly opposite the northern end of the subject property.


3.2     Description of Intersections

Each of the intersections identified by the City Traffic Engineer in the scoping of this TIAS has
been inventoried, with the geometric and operational characteristics of each intersection recorded.

Somerville Avenue at Beacon Street/Adelaide Road and
Somerville Avenue at Mossland Street

The intersection of Somerville Avenue at Beacon Street and Adelaide Road is controlled by the
same controller as the nearby intersection of Somerville Avenue with Mossland Street, which is
approximately 200 feet to the west.

The overall signalized intersection is essentially a five-legged intersection, with Somerville
Avenue at the west end, in the middle, and at the east end. Mossland Street is the northern leg
and Beacon Street is the southern leg. Adelaide Road is also located on the northern leg directly
opposite Beacon Street (versus Mossland Street which is offset to the west by approximately 200
feet).

                                                Traffic Impact and Access Study, Beacon Street Hotel, Somerville, MA



Mossland Street, the southbound approach has two lanes at its approach to Somerville Avenue; an
exclusive "left turn only" lane and an exclusive "right turn only" lane. Mossland Street has no
receiving lanes due to the fact it is a one-way street.

Somerville Avenue, the eastbound approach has two through lanes at its approach to Mossland
Street and one through lane and an exclusive "right turn only" lane at its approach to Beacon
Street. Somerville Avenue has two receiving lanes that eventually taper to one lane. Somerville
Avenue, the westbound approach has one through lane and an exclusive "left turn only" lane at its
approach to Beacon Street and two through lanes its approach to Mossland Street. Somerville
Avenue has two receiving lanes that eventually taper to one lane.

Beacon Street, the northbound approach has one through lane and an exclusive "left turn only"
lane at its approach to Somerville Avenue. Beacon Street has one wide receiving lane. Adelaide
Road, another southbound approach has one all purpose lane at its approach to Somerville
Avenue. Adelaide Road has one narrow receiving lane.

The signal is fully actuated with five phases based on the signal plans provided by the City as part
of the Somerville Avenue Reconstruction Project. The preferential phase sequence is as follows:

    1. A westbound protected left (Phase 1) runs with the westbound through movement (Phase
       6).
    2. The eastbound through movement (Phase 2) runs with the westbound through movement,
       with a permissive westbound left.
    3. An exclusive pedestrian phase (only when actuated).
    4. Beacon Street northbound moves along with the Adelaide Road southbound move, both
       with permissive left turns.
    5. Mossland Street southbound left and right turns.

Land use in the vicinity of this intersection is exclusively residential. On-street parking is not
permitted on Somerville Avenue between these two intersections, but is permitted a couple of
hundred feet prior to the Somerville Avenue approaches to the intersections.

Beacon Street at Oxford Street

Beacon Street at Oxford Street is a three-legged intersection. With a travel lane in each direction,
Oxford Street intersects with Beacon Street at an obtuse angle, which allows for a relatively free
movement for those vehicles travelling southbound on Beacon Street and turning southbound
onto Oxford Street. A ladder type crosswalk exists at the intersection on Oxford Street, and the
Oxford Street northbound lane is the only travel lane at the intersection which is under STOP
control.

Land use at this intersection is primarily residential, though a small retail storefront also exists at
the intersection. On-street parking is also permitted on both Oxford Street and Beacon Street in
the immediate vicinity of the intersection.

Beacon Street at Roseland Street

Beacon Street at Roseland Street is a three-legged intersection. With one travel lane in the
westbound direction, Roseland Street intersects with Beacon Street approximately 100 feet south
of Somerville Avenue. A ladder crosswalk exists at the intersection on Roseland Street, and none
of the travel lanes at the intersection is under any type of control.

                                                  -9-
                                                Traffic Impact and Access Study, Beacon Street Hotel, Somerville, MA




Land use at this intersection is primarily residential, though a small retail storefront also exists at
the intersection. On-street parking is also permitted on Roseland Street and partially on Beacon
Street in the immediate vicinity of the intersection.

Beacon Street at Site Drive

This intersection would be three-legged, with the site drive being the northeastern leg and Beacon
Street continuing to the north and south. The site drive, which leads directly to a ramp, would
have one lane entering and one lane exiting and would be used for access to the below grade
parking structure as well as a loading area and trash storage area. The site drive would be under
STOP control similar to any other signed or unsigned private driveway entering onto a City
Street.

The proposed driveway is situated at the southern end of the site, which provides the greatest
distance between the driveway and the intersection of Somerville Avenue at Beacon Street. This
is the ideal driveway location to minimize the impact of the development on the roadway
network.

Land use at this intersection is primarily residential, though a few small retail storefronts, as
mentioned above, are also in close proximity.


3.3       Description Multi-Modal Infrastructure/Services

Transit

The Porter Square area is served by multiple MBTA bus routes including route numbers 77, 83,
87, 88, 90 and 96. Porter Square is also the location of a MBTA subway (Red Line) and
commuter rail station (Fitchburg-North Station). This MBTA station is located within 1000 feet
of the proposed project site. The close proximity of these transit services means in all likelihood
a significant number of hotel and restaurant patrons will use these services. Being a location that
is conducive to the use of transit, credits have been taken for this mode of transportation, as will
be explained in more detail in Section 6.

Pedestrian Access

Beacon Street, Somerville Avenue, Mossland Street, and Oxford Street all have sidewalks on
both sides of the street. It is likely that pedestrians (non-hotel guests) will visit the proposed
restaurant from the surrounding residential neighborhoods, and similarly, for hotel guests to walk
to the nearby neighborhoods of Porter Square, Davis Square, and Harvard Square. Being a
location that is conducive to pedestrian activity, credits have been taken for this mode of
transportation, as will be explained in more detail in Section 6.


3.4       Traffic Volumes

Manual TMCs were conducted at intersections throughout the study area during the AM and PM
peak hours. However, historical traffic count data were used instead since the traffic volumes
collected were deemed to be lower than expected due to the construction activity on Somerville
Avenue over the past year (per the City Traffic Engineer). The traffic count data collected as part


                                                 -10-
                                               Traffic Impact and Access Study, Beacon Street Hotel, Somerville, MA



of the Functional Design Report (FDR) for the reconstruction of Somerville Avenue were used.
Although historical data suggests that traffic growth has not increased over the past decade and in
some cases has decreased, the 1998 data was grown to establish a conservative estimate of 2008
traffic volumes. This data (from 1998) was grown ten years to 2008 using a 0.25% per year
growth factor to produce 2008 existing conditions traffic volume.

The sole exception to the use of 1998 data is the count data for Beacon Street at Oxford Street.
The December 2008 traffic count data were used. The traffic data between the intersection of
Somerville Avenue and Beacon Street were balanced with the traffic volumes from Beacon Street
at Oxford Street to produce traffic data at Beacon Street and the site drive as well as Beacon
Street at Roseland Street.

Peak Hour Traffic Volumes

The traffic counts from the Somerville Avenue FDR were assumed to be collected for each
intersection during the two hour morning peak period (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM), two hour evening
peak period (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM). Traffic counts were collected for each intersection during the
three hour morning peak period (6:30 AM to 9:30 AM) and three hour evening peak period (4:00
PM to 7:00 PM) in December of 2008 but as described previously, they were not used except for
Beacon Street at Oxford Street. The FDR for the Somerville Avenue Reconstruction Project did
not include count data for the intersection of Beacon Street at Oxford Street.

The peak hours were then identified. This hour represents the highest traffic volume entering the
intersection as a total of all approaches during the four highest consecutive 15 minute intervals.
The morning peak one period and the evening peak one hour period were used in the analyses.

The peak hour traffic volumes used at the study area intersections are illustrated in a figure at the
end of this section (Figure 3). The turning movement count data as well as the researched
historical data are provided in the Appendix.

Seasonal Adjustment

Roadway volumes vary throughout the year. Since traffic volume data are collected during a
finite period of time, they must be adjusted to reflect an average workday. Adjusting the
collected data requires a comparison to annual trends. It has been assumed that the traffic count
data from the Functional Design Report for the Somerville Avenue Reconstruction Project
included an adjustment to average month conditions.

3.5     Safety

To identify trends as well as locations where certain types of crashes are over represented, crash
data were gathered for all of the study area intersections from the Mass Highway crash database
for the three most recent available years. City crash data is typically used to provide for more
recent data (up to the present day); however, slightly older Mass Highway data were used due to
the construction activity present on Somerville Avenue over the last year or so. The construction
activity impacted the accuracy of the traffic volume in the area and may have had the same
impacts on the crash history.

Crash data were obtained from MassHighway for the latest available three year period (Table 2).
These data were evaluated for specific trends to determine whether or not the studied locations
were considered "high-crash" locations and warrant further analysis.

        Table 2 MHD CRASH DATA BY YEAR AND LOCATION (2005 ­ 2007)
                              SOMERVILLE/CAMBRIDGE

      Somerville Avenue & Mossland Street   1    1    1       3


The total number of crashes for the analysis period was examined even further, conforming to
MassHighway's guidelines (Appendix). Their analysis is based on the average number of crashes
per year and the intersection volume. Crash rates are calculated by dividing the average number
of crashes per year by the number of annual vehicles entering an intersection (measured as
"million entering vehicles", or MEV). Turning movement counts for this study and average daily
traffic counts published by MassHighway were used to estimate MEV values. The average
annual rates were divided by MEV values for each location to calculate crash rates for study area
intersections (Table 3).

                 Beacon Street & Oxford Street                      4           1.33         0.22
                 Somerville Avenue & Beacon Street                  1           0.33         0.04
                 Somerville Avenue & Mossland Street                3           1.00         0.15


Each year, MassHighway adds intersection crash rates to their database to establish standardized
baseline rates for both signalized and unsignalized intersections throughout the Commonwealth.
These official rates can be used as an effective tool to measure safety hazards at specific
locations. MassHighway reported that the annual crash rate for District 4 was 0.88 per MEV for
signalized intersections and 0.63 for unsignalized intersections. Crash rates at all study area
intersections fall well below these values.

4.0     Existing (2008) Conditions Analysis


4.1     Analysis

Capacity analyses for the existing conditions were performed for both the signalized and
unsignalized intersections in the study area. This section reports the LOS, volume-to-capacity
ratio, and the queue length by approach and turning movement for each study area intersection
under these conditions (1st Column of Tables 4 and 5). These metrics are commonly used to
determine whether or not a transportation facility provides adequate services for the demand.

The existing building located on site is currently vacant. However, as previously mentioned, the
existing conditions analyses include the gas station/service station because the count data used
was taken while the uses were occupied.


4.2     Signalized Intersections

The intersection of Somerville Avenue with Mossland Street operates at a LOS D in both the
morning and evening peak hours. The intersection of Somerville Avenue at Beacon Street and
Adelaide Road operates at a LOS F in both the morning and evening peak hours. This is
primarily due to the morning commuter traffic that travels southbound on Mossland Street, taking
a left turn onto Somerville Avenue, and then a right turn onto Beacon Street. Therefore, drivers
at this intersection typically experience delays over a minute long during the peak hours; even
under existing conditions.


4.3     Unsignalized Intersections

Unlike signalized intersections, unsignalized intersections do not have an "overall" LOS. The
westbound left turn from Beacon Street to Oxford Street operates at a LOS A in both the morning
and evening peak hours. However, the northbound left turn and right turn from Oxford Street to
Beacon Street operates at a LOS F in both the morning and evening peak hours. This is due to
the one lane stop controlled approach to Beacon Street. Therefore, drivers travelling on Oxford
Street typically experience delays a few minutes long during the peak hours under existing
conditions.

The westbound left turn from Beacon Street to Roseland Street operates at a LOS A in both the
morning and evening peak hours. The southbound move from the Site Drive onto Beacon Street
operates at a LOS D in the morning peak hour and a LOS E in evening peak hour. This is typical
of a private driveway approaching an urban minor arterial.

The Appendix contains the entire capacity analyses output, including delays and levels of services
associated with each individual movement.

5.0     No-Build Conditions Analysis (2013)


5.1   Background Growth

Background traffic growth generally occurs as a result of population increases within and around
the study area, demographic changes, and future unspecified development. In accordance with
MassHighway and MEPA requirements, a 5-year planning horizon (2013) was used to evaluate
future traffic operations with and without the proposed action.

As previously mentioned, the historical traffic data suggests that traffic has been shrinking. A
quarter percent (0.25%) growth rate was used to grow the 1998 data to 2008 for conservative
purposes. A more conservative growth rate of half a percent (0.5%) per year was used to account
for the normal background growth in traffic resulting from changes in local economic activity and
other proposed developments that may be in place by the year 2013. With the assumption that the
economy will improve over the next five years, the 0.5% per year growth rate was used to predict
the future no-build conditions (versus the 0.25% growth rate).

The peak hour traffic volumes used for the future no-build conditions at the study area
intersections are illustrated after Section 5.2 (Figure 4).

5.2   Analysis

Capacity analyses for future conditions were performed for both the signalized and unsignalized
intersections in the study area for the year 2013. As with the previous sections, this section
reports the LOS, volume-to-capacity ratio, and the queue length by approach and turning
movement for each study area intersection under these conditions.

Capacity analyses were conducted at study area intersections for the no-build conditions, 2013
(2nd Column of Table 4). The key findings of these analyses are presented in the following
section.

The existing building located on site is currently vacant in the year 2008. However, the site was
tenanted and the use was active when the 1998 count data was collected. Therefore, both the
existing (2008) and future no-build (2013) conditions include traffic related to the allowed uses
within the existing building. If there is degradation in the LOS, when the no-build 2013
conditions are compared to the existing conditions, it is due to the growth factor accounting for
increased population, economic activity, and other unforeseen projects.

According to the proponent, the most recent use occupied the existing building for many years.
The site was used as a gas station with four fueling stations, one to two service bays, and an area
for used car sales. Land Use Code (LUC) 944 ­ Gas Station is the relevant Land Use Code (for
traffic generation purposes) provided in the Institute of Transportation Engineers: Land Use
Report. ITE Land Use Code titles do not necessarily match land use titles within a zoning
ordinance. Therefore, traffic engineers choose the most appropriate available use that describes
the traffic generation associated with that use. LUC 944 does include both gas pump service and
repair service. Again, trips associated with this use are accounted for in the existing and future
no-build networks.

5.3     Signalized Intersections

The overall LOS values remain unchanged from 1998 conditions to 2013 no-build conditions;
however the delays do increase due to the addition of the background growth. Therefore, drivers
at this intersection will continue to experience delays over a minute long during the peak hours;
even under future no-build conditions.

The intersection of Somerville Avenue with Mossland Street operates at a LOS D in both the
morning and evening peak hours. The intersection of Somerville Avenue at Beacon Street and
Adelaide Road operates at a LOS F in both the morning and evening peak hours. This is
primarily due to the morning commuter traffic that travels SB on Mossland Street, taking a left
turn onto Somerville Avenue, and then a right turn onto Beacon Street.


5.4     Unsignalized Intersections

The LOS values remain unchanged from 1998 conditions to 2013 no-build conditions; however
the delays do increase due to the addition of the background growth. Therefore, drivers travelling
on Oxford Street will continue to experience delays a few minutes long during the peak hours
under future no-build conditions.

The westbound left turn from Beacon Street to Oxford Street operates at a LOS A in both the
morning and evening peak hours. However, the northbound left turn and right turn from Oxford
Street to Beacon Street operates at a LOS F in both the morning and evening peak hours. This is
due to the one lane stop controlled approach to Beacon Street.

The westbound left turn from Beacon Street to Roseland Street operates at a LOS A in both the
morning and evening peak hours. The SB move from the Site Drive onto Beacon Street operates
at a LOS D in the morning peak hour and a LOS E in evening peak hour. This is typical of a
private driveway approaching an urban minor arterial.

The Appendix contains the entire capacity analyses output, including delays and levels of services
associated with each individual movement.

6.0     Future Build Analysis (2013)


6.1     Development Program

The subject property is an approximately 9,670 square feet lot located at 369-371 Beacon Street
in Somerville, Massachusetts (Figure 1). Although no longer in operation, occupying the lot is a
gas station with a small ancillary single-story building that houses an office/retail storefront and a
mechanic's bay. It is the applicant's intention to demolish and remove the existing building and
service pumps and in their place construct a new hotel building with 35 guestrooms and a 60 seat
restaurant. An underground parking structure on the lot would provide 28 parking spaces.

Currently, vehicular access to the site is provided from Beacon Street, an urban arterial with one
travel lane in each direction. Vehicles entering or exiting the site do so via existing curb cuts on
Beacon Street. Vehicular access to the proposed underground parking at the hotel would also be
from Beacon Street, where a driveway ramp capable of accommodating two-way traffic would be
located.


6.2     Trip Generation

The proposed program is anticipated to generate additional traffic which is distributed, and
assigned to the roadway network. The trips were generated using ITE's Trip Generation Manual,
7th Edition. After the trips were generated, they were distributed, based on a gravity model,
which relied on existing traffic distributions in the study area. Once the distribution was
identified, trips were assigned to the roadway network.


6.3     Trip Rates

Trip generation estimates have been prepared in accordance with the traffic study guidelines
established by the Executive Office of Transportation & Public Works (EOTPW) and Executive
Office of Environmental & Energy Affairs (EOEEA) using the methodology provided in the most
recent edition of the Trip Generation Handbook (TGH) published by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers and the trip generation rates contained in the 7th Edition of Trip
Generation Manual (TGM), also published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers.

The first step in the trip generation process is to calculate the "gross" trips for the existing and
proposed uses based on the trip generation rates provided in the above referenced documents.
The next step in the trip generation process is to determine if appropriate reductions should be
applied to the gross trips. If applicable, the reductions are applied to the existing and proposed
site generated trips. Once the reduction factors have been applied, the existing site generated
trips are subtracted from the proposed site generated trips to produce the net new site generated
trips.

6.3.1     Gross Trip Generation

Land Use Code (LUC) 944 Gas Station from ITE'S TGM was used for the existing site generated
trips. The number of fueling positions was used to determine the traffic volume that would be
generated for the existing site trips. LUC 312 Business Hotel and LUC 931 Quality Restaurant
from ITE'S TGM were used for proposed site generated trips. The number of employees of the
hotel and the number of seats for the restaurant were used to determine the traffic volume that
would be generated in conjunction with ITE's Trip Generation Manual.

ITE Land Use Code titles do not necessarily match land use titles within a zoning ordinance.
Therefore, traffic engineers choose the most appropriate available use that describes the traffic
generation associated with that use. LUC 944 includes both gas pump service and repair services.
The "gross" site trips associated with the existing and proposed uses are represented in the table
below (Table 6).

6.4       Trip Credits

6.4.1     Pass-by

For a conservative approach, the trips associated with the gas station were reduced using industry
accepted practices, specifically pass-by trips. The ITE Handbook suggests that approximately
80% of the trips associated with a gas station use already exist on the nearby roadway system.

The State of Massachusetts has historically only allowed a maximum of a 25% as a pass-by
reduction factor for proposed uses. We have used the empirical data (from ITE) to arrive at a
more conservative approach; it is conservative because the trips are subtracted from the network
before adding the hotel & restaurant trips. With a greater the reduction factor, fewer trips are
subtracted from the future no-build roadway network. If the 25% reduction factor were applied to
the existing site trips, the proposed uses would actually result in a reduction to the number of trips
on the street network.

6.4.2   Mode Split

Traditional site development includes applying a number of trip credits to the gross trip
generation numbers. Based on the geographical proximity of the site to public transit, as well as
the density of housing in the area, a large percentage of patrons will take the subway, a taxi, walk,
or ride a bike. As a result, the automobile trips can be reduced by a certain percentage. This
"mode-split" is unique to regions, uses, and neighborhoods. Considering the proposed use and
location, a mode-split can be applied to the trip generation values. Further reductions to the site
trips generate by the proposed uses, including pass-by and diverted-linked credits may also be
applicable, however, were not considered in this study.

Traffic Solutions knew of a very comparable site already constructed in Cambridge, MA. The
ITE TGM assumes all trips drive to and from a site. ITE further suggests that in urban areas, it is
acceptable, even recommended to apply applicable reduction factors. ITE recommends using
local data wherever possible. Therefore, Traffic Solutions collected mode split data at a similar
site, specifically the Kendall Hotel located at 350 Main Street in Kendall Square (Figure 5). The
Hotel has similar characteristics including the number of hotel rooms (as compared to a large
chain suggest as the Marriot Hotel), an on-site restaurant, and the proximity to a rapid transit
station (within 100 feet).

6.4.2   Mode Split (Continued)

A data collection effort was identified that would allow for mode split determination. Two
primary, traditional data collection methods were used. Vehicle manual turning movement
counts were collected at the Kendall Hotel's garage during the daily peak hours. Additionally, a
user survey was performed at the hotel's pedestrian entrance. People entering and exiting the
Hotel were asked what mode of transportation they used to get to/or what mode of transportation
they are using leaving the site.

The results of the data collection effort indicate that a high number of trips arrive/depart using
other (non-vehicular) transportation modes (Table 7). Trains, buses, and other modes of public
transportation are not considered vehicular modes of transportation since they will not be added
to the street network and site driveway, and thus a new trip is not added.

In the morning peak hour, 46 % of the trips used a vehicle (personal vehicle or taxi) and the
remaining 54 % used some other mode of transportation (e.g., bus, train, bicycle, walked). In the
evening peak hour, 32 % of the trips used a personal vehicle or taxi and the remaining 68 % used
some other mode of transportation.

The resulting mode split percentages (from Section 6.4) were applied to the trip generation rates
estimated for the proposed uses during the morning peak hour and evening peak hour,
respectively. If the proposed project does not move forward, the site can be re-tenanted with
allowed uses including the most recent use, a gas station. The trips associated with this re-
tenanting were included in the future no-build condition but are removed during the future build
condition to allow the new use to occupy the space.

6.5     Project Traffic ­ Net Trip Generation

The total trips estimated using ITE's methodology results in potentially 11 new vehicle trips on
the roadway network in the morning peak hour and 12 new vehicle trips on the roadway network
in the evening peak hour. This estimate includes reductions to existing site generated trips due to
pass-by credits and reductions to proposed site generated trips due to mode split credits, as
discussed in the previous section. The number of trips that may be on the roadway varies
throughout the day. These trips were distributed to the AM and PM peak hours using ITE
average rates. The "net" number of trips that will potentially be added to the roadway by the
project is simply the difference between the new uses and the existing use (Table 8).

6.6     Trip Distribution

The objective of trip distribution is to distribute the site generated trips by percentages throughout
the roadway network that will be used to access the site. The total trip distribution percentages
were determined for trips travelling to the site (in) and from the site (out).

An analysis of existing travel patterns were used to distribute the project generated trips onto the
roadway network (Figure 6). This traffic pattern was used for the next step in the traffic impact
process, trip assignment.

6.7     Trip Assignment

This step assigns each of the project trips to a specific turning movement for each of the study
peak hours. Trip assignment is accomplished by combining the trip generation, with the trip
distribution patterns. The reduced existing site generated trips were assigned to study area
intersections (Figure 7). The reduced proposed site generated trips were assigned to study area
intersections (Figure 8). The reduced proposed site generated trips were then added to the future
no-build trips (after subtracting the reduced gas station trips) to produce the full build conditions
(Figure 9).

6.8     Analysis

Using the project volumes, intersection capacity analyses have been conducted for each study
area for both future conditions; without mitigation and with mitigation (3rd and 4th Columns of
Table 4). The future build without mitigation condition represents the results of building the
project without changing the infrastructure (traffic signal, signs, and markings). As with the
previous analyses, this section reports the LOS, volume-to-capacity ratio, and the queue length by
approach and turning movement for each study area intersection under these conditions.

6.9     Future Build without Recommended Improvements (2013)

The future build without recommended improvements condition represents the results of building
the project without changing the infrastructure (3rd Column of Table 4).

6.9.1   Signalized Intersections

The overall LOS values remain unchanged 2013 no-build conditions to the 2013 build conditions.
Even the delays essentially remain the same. Therefore, drivers at this intersection will continue
to experience delays over a minute long during the peak hours. However, this is not due to the
project because the intersection already operates at these levels of service under future no-build
conditions.

The intersection of Somerville Avenue with Mossland Street operates at a LOS D in both the
morning and evening peak hours. The intersection of Somerville Avenue at Beacon Street and
Adelaide Road operates at a LOS F in both the morning and evening peak hours.

6.9.2   Unsignalized Intersections

The LOS values remain unchanged 2013 no-build conditions to the 2013 build conditions.
Therefore, drivers travelling on Oxford Street will continue to experience delays a few minutes
long during the peak hours under future no-build conditions. However, this is not due to the
project because the intersection already operates at these levels of service under future no-build
conditions.

The westbound left turn from Beacon Street to Oxford Street operates at a LOS A in both the
morning and evening peak hours. However, the northbound left turn and right turn from Oxford
Street to Beacon Street operates at a LOS F in both the morning and evening peak hours.

The westbound left turn from Beacon Street to Roseland Street operates at a LOS A in both the
morning and evening peak hours. The southbound move from the Site Drive onto Beacon Street
operates at a LOS D in the morning peak hour and a LOS E in evening peak hour. Again, this is
typical of a private driveway approaching an urban minor arterial.

The Appendix contains the entire capacity analyses output, including delays and levels of services
associated with each individual movement.

6.10    Future Build with Recommended Improvements (2013)

The future build with recommended improvements condition represents the results of building the
project with changing the infrastructure (traffic signal, signs, and markings). Specifically, Traffic
Solutions included the following improvements to determine if they resulted in improved levels
of service (4th Column of Table 4).

·   Change the lane assignment for the Mossland Street SB approach, using pavement markings
    and signs, to allow a double left turn onto Somerville Avenue;

·   Change the bridge cross section on the Beacon Street approach to Somerville Avenue, using
    pavement markings only, to allow for two receiving lanes versus one; so that a double right
    turn is allowed from Somerville Avenue to Beacon Street;

·   Change the lane assignment for the Beacon Street NB approach, using pavement markings
    and signs, to allow for two lanes around the corner back to Oxford Street;

·   Change the lane assignment for the Oxford Street NB approach, using pavement markings
    and signs and restricting parking, to allow for two lanes approach lanes to Beacon Street; and

·   Optimize traffic signal timing without changing the phasing


6.10.1 Signalized Intersections

The signals were "optimized" during the analysis, which improves the LOS at the signalized
intersections. The overall LOS values essentially remains unchanged from the 2013 no-build
conditions to the 2013 build conditions. However, the delays (in seconds) improve. For instance,
the average delay for Somerville Avenue at Beacon Street improves from approximately 150
seconds in both peak periods to approximately 130 seconds in the AM peak hour and
approximately 90 seconds in the PM peak hour. Therefore, drivers at this intersection will
continue to experience delays over a minute long during the peak hours. However, this is not due
to the project because the intersection already operates at these levels of service under future no-
build conditions.

The intersection of Somerville Avenue with Mossland Street operates at a LOS D in both the
morning and evening peak hours. The intersection of Somerville Avenue at Beacon Street and
Adelaide Road operates at a LOS F in both the morning and evening peak hours.


6.10.2 Unsignalized Intersections

The LOS values essentially remains unchanged from the 2013 no-build conditions to the 2013
build conditions during the PM peak hour period. However, the delays (in seconds) improve.
Also, in the AM peak hour, the estimated overall intersection LOS does improve. Therefore,
drivers travelling on Oxford Street will continue to experience delays during the peak hours under
future no-build conditions. However, this is not due to the project because the intersection
already operates at these levels of service under future no-build conditions. In fact, the right
turning vehicles from Oxford Street would experience fewer delays.

6.10.2 Unsignalized Intersections (Continued)

The westbound left turn from Beacon Street to Oxford Street operates at a LOS A in both the
morning and evening peak hours. However, the northbound left turn will operate a LOS F while
the right turn from Oxford Street to Beacon Street will improve and operate at a LOS C in both
the morning and evening peak hours.

The westbound left turn from Beacon Street to Roseland Street operates at a LOS A in both the
morning and evening peak hours. The southbound move from the Site Drive onto Beacon Street
operates at a LOS D in the morning peak hour and a LOS E in evening peak hour. Again, this is
typical of a private driveway approaching an urban minor arterial.

7.0     Conclusions

This report analyzed the effect of the proposed hotel and restaurant in Somerville, MA. The
number of trips generated by the new use is a nominal amount as compared to the trips associated
with the existing permitted use, a gas station. Using industry accepted trip generation values for
this type of development, it is clear that the impact on surrounding streets is negligible during the
peak hours. The proposed project is expected to attract only 11 net new vehicles during the
morning peak hour and 12 net new vehicles in the evening peak hour; approximately one new
vehicle every five minutes.

As stated in Section 6.3, a conservative approach was taken during the trip generation process. If
the 25% reduction factor were applied to the existing site trips (versus the ~80%), the proposed
uses would actually result in a net reduction to the site generated trips. This means that the
proposed uses (Hotel & Restaurant) would produce fewer vehicle trips than the existing site (Gas
Station).

Using the conservative approach, the signalized and unsignalized intersections will operate at the
same LOS with or without the project. The study area intersections experience delays but the
delays are not associated with the construction of the proposed project. Although the study area
intersections experience delays, according to the crash history, safety does not appear to be an
issue. Based on these findings, the proposed project will have a negligible impact to safety and
delay, if any, on the transportation network surrounding the project.

In addition, Traffic Solutions investigated a few possible improvements to improve levels of
service even though the project is not adding a significant amount of trips. These low cost
measures included changing lane assignments by use of pavement markings, signs, and parking
restrictions (only where applicable). The possible improvements also consisted of optimizing the
traffic signal timing at the signalized intersection. These improvements would not result in
significant improvements to LOS but would result in slightly fewer delays.

Most of these improvements may be able to be implemented as part of the Somerville Avenue
Reconstruction Project since the construction is on-going. The signal equipment has yet to be
installed and the pavement markings and signs are typically some of the last items to be installed
as part of a reconstruction project.

Finally, the proposed driveway is situated at the southern end of the site, which provides the
greatest distance between the driveway and the intersection of Somerville Avenue at Beacon
Street. This is the ideal driveway location to minimize the impact of the development on the
roadway network.

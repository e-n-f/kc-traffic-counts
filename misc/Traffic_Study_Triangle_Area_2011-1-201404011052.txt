I.     INTRODUCTION
The Arvada Triangle redevelopment area generally encompasses the area from Kipling
Parkway on the west, Garrison Street on the east, 57th Avenue on the south, and the Ralston
Creek on the north in Arvada, Colorado. The site's location relative to major roadways in the
area can be seen on Figure 1.

The proposed Arvada Triangle property would redevelop the majority of existing development
with a mix of residential, office and retail land uses. The exact intensity of development will be
determined over time, as a function of future market conditions. As part of the planning
process, several development scenarios have been formulated, each with a different mix of
uses and building types. Although an exact site plan has yet to be developed, a potential
layout of the uses is shown graphically in Figure 2.

The purpose of this study is to assess the traffic impacts on the adjacent roadways /
intersections related to the most likely intensity of the proposed development and to identify
roadway improvements needed to accommodate vehicle-trips generated by the proposed
land uses. This report includes information on existing traffic conditions, vehicle-trips
associated with the planned development, and total traffic volume projections. The year
2020 was analyzed as the mid-point horizon, while the year 2035 represents the long-term
traffic implications of the proposed development.

II.       EXISTING CONDITIONS
A.        Existing Site

The proposed development generally parallels the Ralston Road alignment to the north and
south from Kipling Parkway on the west to Garrison Street on the east. The majority of land
within the project site is built out with various commercial uses, and includes the Arvada Square
and Arvada Plaza shopping centers. A King Soopers and Big K shopping center are located
near the Kipling Parkway corridor along the north side of Ralston Road. Farther east within the
study area, retail uses consist of strip malls with neighborhood commercial uses (dry cleaners,
auto parts stores, etc) and various fast food / sit-down restaurants.

The area surrounding the project site contains various residential developments, as well as
parks and open space.

B.        Existing Roadway Network

The roadway network surrounding the site consists of the following facilities:

      ·   Ralston Road ­ Ralston Road is an east-west arterial roadway adjacent to the site. The
          corridor consists of a four-lane paved urban roadway with curb / gutter and sidewalks,
          and either a raised or painted center median. Several curb cuts are provided along
          Ralston Road, providing direct access to / from the various retail developments along the
          corridor. The posted speed limit near the project site is 35 mph.
      ·   Kipling Parkway ­ Kipling Parkway is a north-south roadway which becomes the 64th
          Avenue corridor to the north of the project site. In the vicinity of the development, the
          cross section of Kipling Parkway consists of a four-lane median divided cross section
          with sidewalks on either side of the roadway. The posted speed limit near the project
          site is 35 mph.
      ·   Independence Street ­ Independence Street is a north-south roadway within the study
          area. The corridor provides for direct access to / from the various commercial land uses
          in within the redevelopment area. North of Ralston Road, the corridor consists of a four-
          lane paved urban roadway with curb / gutter. The posted speed on Independence Street
          is 35 mph.
      ·   Garrison Street ­ Garrison Street is a north-south local roadway which provides for
          direct access to / from various residences along the corridor. The corridor consists of a
          three-lane paved urban roadway with curb / gutter, which transitions north of the Arvada
          Triangle to a two-lane cross section with on-street parking along both sides of the
          roadway. The posted speed on Garrison Street is 25 mph.




                                                                                               Page 4
Arvada Triangle Redevelopment                                            Traffic Impact Analysis



C.     Traffic Volumes

Evening peak hour traffic volumes were derived from the Ralston Road Traffic Primer, Felsburg
Holt & Ullevig, February 2010. Traffic volumes from the Ralston Road report were recorded
during the month of November 2009 at the Kipling Parkway, Independence Street, Garrison
Street and Holland Street intersections with Ralston Road. The peak hour traffic counts were
collected in 15-minute intervals on a typical day during the hours of 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The
existing traffic volumes in the vicinity of the site are presented on Figure 3 and the raw traffic
count data can be found in Appendix A.

The existing counts show that traffic flows along in the area are primarily to the eastbound and
northbound directions in the afternoon.

D.     Traffic Operations

Traffic operations within the study area were evaluated according to techniques documented in
the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2000) using the existing traffic
volumes and intersection geometry. Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative measure of traffic
operational conditions, based on roadway capacity and vehicle delay. LOS is described by a
letter designation ranging from A to F, with LOS A representing almost free-flow travel, while
LOS F represents congested conditions. At signalized intersections, an overall LOS is reported
for the intersection, while LOS at unsignalized intersections are calculated for movements which
must yield right-of-way to other traffic movements.

The results of the analysis show that each of the study area signalized intersection operates at
LOS C or better, an acceptable condition, during the PM peak hour.

The results of the capacity analyses are shown on Figure 3, and Appendix B contains the
existing traffic operational analysis worksheets.

III.   PROPOSED PROJECT
A.     Project Description

As stated previously, the Arvada Triangle redevelopment area generally encompasses the area
from Kipling Parkway on the west, Garrison Street on the east, 57th Avenue on the south, and
the Ralston Creek on the north. The majority of land within the project site is built out with
various commercial uses, and includes the Arvada Square and Arvada Plaza shopping centers.
A King Soopers and Big K shopping center are located near the Kipling Parkway corridor along
the north side of Ralston Road. Farther east within the study area, retail uses consist of strip
malls with neighborhood commercial uses (dry cleaners, auto parts stores, etc) and various fast
food / sit-down restaurants.

The proposed project would redevelop the majority of existing space with a mix of residential,
office and retail land uses. The type and intensity of development would vary based on the
development plan. As part of this study, it was assumed that the most aggressive development
plan would be implemented to determine the project's "worst case" impact on the adjacent
transportation network. Figure 4 shows the proposed development organized into individual
parcels and Table 1 contains a breakdown by parcel of the proposed land uses.

Of note, the proposed development intensities shown in Table 1 are in addition to existing uses
that will remain on site. Portions of the existing retail development within Parcel 5, Parcel 6,
Parcel 7 and Parcel 11 will remain. When calculating the proposed development intensities per
parcel, the total square footage of existing development was subtracted from the overall total.
For instance, in Parcel 11 it was assumed that a total of 255,000 SF of retail development would
be constructed once redevelopment is completed. However, the two big box users (King
Soopers and Big K) in Parcel 11 totaling 195,000 SF will remain, so the projected intensity in
Table 1 would only be 60,000 SF of new retail. This method was used to avoid double counting
traffic volumes generated by the overall development.

B.     Site Trip Generation

The number of vehicle-trips generated by the proposed development was forecast based on
equations and procedures documented in Trip Generation, Institute of Transportation
Engineers, Eighth Edition, 2008. The trip rates, contained in the manual, are developed
primarily through field observations of similar land uses throughout the nation. The data
contained in the trip generation manual is nationally recognized and is used by the vast majority
of municipalities in Colorado to determine the impact future developments may have on the
surrounding transportation infrastructure.

Table 2 shows the trip generation for the proposed development overall, and by parcel.

The proposed development would generate approximately 22,600 vehicle trips per day (vpd),
733 vehicle trips per hour (vph) during the AM peak and 2,192 vph during the PM peak hour
when fully built-out.

To remain conservative (high estimate) while maintaining flexible with development intensities,
an internal reduction (trips between uses that stay on-site) and pass-by trip assignment was not
applied to the trip generation estimates.

C.        Trip Distribution and Traffic Assignment

Trip distribution percentages in the report were based on previous reports completed in the area
including the Ralston Road Traffic Primer, the Ralston Fields Urban Renewal Plan, September
2003 and the Ridge Home Property Urban Renewal Plan, August 1999. Each report based site
distribution on estimates contained in the current DRCOG travel demand model. Using the
distribution estimates from each of those reports, distribution percentages were further refined
based on the development's location relative to the major surrounding roadways and the types of
proposed land uses on individual parcels.

Two different distribution percentages were used in the study, and are as follows:

Retail / Office Uses
   · 15 percent to/from the west on Ralston Road
      ·   15 percent to/from the east on Ralston Road
      ·   5 percent to/from the north on Garrison Street
      ·   4 percent to/from the south on Garrison Street




                                                                                           Page 10

   ·   25 percent to/from the south on Kipling Parkway
   ·   20 percent to/from the south on Independence Street
   ·   16 percent to/from the north of the Independence Street / Kipling Parkway merge


Residential
   · 10 percent to/from the west on Ralston Road
   ·   30 percent to/from the east on Ralston Road
   ·   1 percent to/from the north on Garrison Street
   ·   1 percent to/from the south on Garrison Street
   ·   32 percent to/from the south on Kipling Parkway
   ·   20 percent to/from the south on Independence Street
   ·   6 percent to/from the north of the Independence Street / Kipling Parkway merge


When assigning traffic to each parcel, it was assumed that additional access points between the
four study intersections would be provided, similar to current conditions. In most locations, it
was assumed that these access points would be limited to right-in / right-out only. The only
exception would be Parcel 11, where it was assumed that one ¾ movement (allowing an
eastbound left-turn movement into the site) access would be provided on Ralston Road
between Kipling Parkway and Independence Street. In that stretch of roadway, there are
currently four full movement access points that serve Parcel 11. Eliminating all full movements
would add a significant amount of eastbound left-turning traffic at the Independence Street /
Ralston Road intersection, potential causing capacity related issues.


The site trip distribution assumptions and site traffic assignment are shown on Figure 5.

Arvada Triangle Redevelopment                                          Traffic Impact Analysis



IV.    BACKGROUND (WITHOUT SITE) TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
A.     Roadway Network

Per the Ralston Road Traffic Primer report and on-going discussions, the Ralston Road corridor is
planned to remain as a four-lane arterial throughout the study area. However, portions of the
roadway will be improved to include a raised center median.

B.     Traffic Volumes

The mid- and long-term background traffic volumes were based on information contained in the
Ralston Road Traffic Primer report.

Per the Ralston Road report, traffic volumes in the study area are projected to grow 30% between
now and year 2035. The growth rate was established by a review of growth in population and
employment numbers in the DRCOG travel demand model. It should be noted that the 30%
growth rate accounted for the potential redevelopment of the Arvada Triangle.

Using previous recommendations, peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections were
adjusted by the base 30% (15% for the mid-year horizon) growth factor. Reductions to the base
30% factor were then applied at each intersection to account for lower growth along roadway
corridors that are surrounded by built out land uses (Garrison Street north, Independence Street),
and to avoid double counting redevelopment within the Arvada Triangle. Small shifts in
background traffic were also assumed for the extension of Garrison Street south to 57th Avenue.

The mid- and long-term background traffic volumes are shown on Figure 6 and Figure 7
respectively.

C.     Traffic Operations

Mid-Point Horizon

Level of Service analyses were conducted, using the same procedures described previously, to
determine the operational characteristics of the study intersections.

The results of the capacity analysis shows that the Kipling Parkway / Ralston Road intersection
would operate at LOS C during the PM peak hour. While the intersection would operate with an
acceptable LOS, several movements would be nearing capacity including most left-turning
movements as well as the northbound through movement.

The Independence Street and Garrison Street intersections would operate at LOS C during the
PM peak hour.

The Holland Street / Ralston Road intersection would operate at LOS A during the PM peak
hour. Due to the redevelopment to the area north (complete redevelopment) of Ralston Road,
the southbound approach would be removed. The results of the capacity analysis are shown on
Figure 6 and Appendix C contains the background traffic operational analysis worksheets.

Arvada Triangle Redevelopment                                        Traffic Impact Analysis



Long-Term Horizon

Level of Service analyses were conducted, using the same procedures described previously, to
determine the operational characteristics of the study intersections.

The results of the capacity analysis shows that the Kipling Parkway / Ralston Road intersection
would operate at LOS D during the PM peak hour, and would near the capacity threshold.
Several movements would operate at or over capacity. It should be noted that the Ralston Road
Primer Study concluded that the Ralston Road and corridor would operate at or near the capacity
threshold by year 2035.

The Independence Street / Ralston Road and Garrison Street / Ralston Road intersections would
operate at LOS C during the PM peak hour. The Holland Street intersection would operate at
LOS B during the PM peak hour in year 2035.

The results of the capacity analyses are shown on Figure 7 and Appendix C contains the
background traffic operational analysis worksheets.




                                                                                      Page 16

V.     TOTAL (WITH SITE) FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
A.     Traffic Volumes

The site generated traffic volumes were added to the background traffic volumes for each future
year to determine total traffic volumes for each scenario. The addition of site traffic volumes
would increase two-way Ralston Road PM peak hour volumes by as much as 1075 vehicles per
hour (vph), which would account for approximately 33% of traffic along the corridor. The
projected short-term and long-term total traffic volumes are shown on Figure 8 and Figure 9,
respectively.

B.     Traffic Operations

Mid-Term Horizon

Level of Service analyses was conducted to determine the traffic impact of the redevelopment
on the mid-term conditions.

The results of the analysis shows that the Kipling Parkway / Ralston Road intersection would
operate at LOS D, an acceptable condition, during the PM peak hour. To maintain acceptable
operations at the intersection, the northbound left-turn approach would need to be re-striped to
include two left-turn lanes. With this improvement, the City may investigate the use of north /
south protected only left-turn control (currently protected / permitted). Also, due to the increase
in traffic to the westbound approach of the intersection, in particular the westbound left-turn, the
east / west left-turning movements should continue to operate under protected / permitted
control to increase the capacity of the left-turn movement.

The Independence Street / Ralston Road intersection would operate at LOS D during the PM
peak hour. To ensure acceptable operation of the intersection, it is critical that at least one
eastbound left-turn movement be provided into Parcel 11 between Kipling Parkway and
Independence Street to reduce the left-turning demand at the intersection.

The Holland Street / Ralston Road intersection would operate at LOS C during the PM peak
hour, and the Garrison Street intersection would continue to operate with similar LOS with the
redevelopment of the Arvada Triangle. The results of the capacity analyses are shown on
Figure 8, and Appendix D contains the total traffic operational analysis worksheets.

Long-Term Horizon

The results of the long-term (Year 2035) total traffic analyses show that the Kipling Parkway /
Ralston Road intersection would operate at capacity (LOS E) during the PM peak hour. The
eastbound and northbound approaches would operate at or above the capacity threshold. Per
the HCM thresholds, an intersection would operate at LOS E when the intersection delay
exceeds 55 seconds. The Ralston Road / Kipling Parkway intersection would operate with 56.7
seconds of delay.

Each of the remaining study intersections would continue to operate with similar LOS as
compared to the 2020 total traffic scenario during the PM peak hour.

The results of the capacity analyses are shown on Figure 9, and Appendix D contains the total
traffic operational analysis worksheets.

C.     Site Access

As stated previously, it was assumed that additional access points between the four study
intersections would be provided. In most locations, it was assumed that these access points
would be limited to right-in / right-out only. The only exception would be Parcel 11, where it was
assumed that one ¾ movement (allowing an eastbound left-turn movement into the site) access
would be provided on Ralston Road between Kipling Parkway and Independence Street.


Overall, the number of access points should be limited to improve operations along the Ralston
Road corridor. However, providing access to individual parcels should remain sensitive to the
proposed land uses, and the need to provide adequate internal site circulation. When
redevelopment of individual parcels occurs, access plans are recommended to be reviewed by
the City to ensure that each access would operate in a safe and efficient manner.

VII.   SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Arvada Triangle redevelopment area generally encompasses the area from Kipling
Parkway on the west, Garrison Street on the east, 57th Avenue on the north, and the Ralston
Creek on the north. The majority of land within the project site is built out with various
commercial uses, and includes the Arvada Square and Arvada Plaza shopping centers.

The proposed project would redevelop the majority of existing space with a mix of residential,
office and retail land uses. The type and intensity of development would vary based on the
development plan. As part of this study, it was assumed that the most aggressive development
plan would be implemented to determine the projects "worst case" impact on the adjacent
transportation network.

At build out, the proposed redevelopment would generate approximately 22,600 vehicle trips per
day (vpd), 733 vehicle trips per hour (vph) during the AM peak and 2,192 vph during the PM
peak hour when fully built-out. It should be noted, the site traffic generation provides a
conservative (high) estimate as an internal reduction (trips between uses that say on-site) and
pass-by trip assignment were not applied to the estimate.

The following is a summary of the findings and recommendations related to the traffic impacts of
the proposed development:

   ·   When volumes warrant, restripe the northbound approach of the Kipling Parkway /
       Ralston Road intersection to provide dual left-turn lanes and investigate the need for
       protected only north and southbound left-turn phasing.

   ·   Maintain a four-lane divided Ralston Road corridor through the study area.

   ·   Allow direct access from individual parcels to / from the Ralston Road corridor, while
       restricting access as needed to right-in / right-out. Access plans for individual Parcels
       are recommended to be reviewed by the City to ensure safe and efficient operations.

   ·   Provide for a mid-block eastbound left-turn movement on Ralston Road between Kipling
       Parkway and Independence Street into Parcel 11.

No other improvements appear necessary.

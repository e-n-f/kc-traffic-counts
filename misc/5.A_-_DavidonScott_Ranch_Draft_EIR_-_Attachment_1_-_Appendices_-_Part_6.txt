Flooding
The site is above the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) 100-year and 500-year
flood zones for the Petaluma River (FEMA, 1989). The site is not susceptible to tsunamis or
seiches. However, if the small stock pond embankment were to fail while retaining water, that
water would be released onto the downslope property. Berlogar recommended the north slope of
the stock pond embankment be reinforced with a keyed earth buttress with a slope inclination not
to exceed 2:1 (horizontal:vertical). Subsurface drainage should also be installed during the
construction of the earth buttress.

T&R concurs with Berlogar's recommendation to buttress the existing stock pond embankment
to reduce the potential for future flooding. Also, T&R recommends properly maintaining the
earthen ditch system that directs overflow water toward the east to the existing swale. The
periodic inspection and maintenance of this system should become the responsibility of the
homeowner's association or similar entity.

Expansive Soil
Expansive soils shrink or swell with changes in moisture content. Clay mineralogy, clay content,
and porosity of the soil influence the change in volume. The shrinking and swelling caused by
expansive clay-rich soil can result in damage to overlying structures. Site soils encountered by
Berlogar were found to be moderately expansive. The Berlogar report indicates that 5- to 35-
foot-thick layers of compacted fill may swell between 3/4 and 1-1/2 inches, respectively. The
actual swell will depend on the total thickness of fill, material in the fill, and in-place moisture
content and density. The Berlogar report indicates mitigation alternatives for expansive soils
include moisture conditioning and recompaction of expansive soil, use of non-expansive fill, or
designing foundations to resist or tolerate differential movement of expansive soil.

Based on T&R's experience, the soil within the zone of seasonal soil fluctuation or within areas
susceptible to flooding may experience differential movement associated with expansive soil.
Typically, the depth of severe seasonal moisture change is limited to about 2 to 3 feet below the
ground surface. Therefore, in T&R's opinion, Berlogar's swell estimates for a properly
moisture-conditioned and compacted fill with a thickness greater than about three feet, does not
seem to be consistent with the behavior of moderately expansive soil. Although, T&R concurs
with Berlogar regarding the proposed mitigation alternatives that include moisture-conditioning
and recompacting the soil, using non-expansive fill, or designing foundations to resist or tolerate
differential movement. In addition, T&R suggests that site grades be designed to slope away
from the proposed structures and water from roof drains be directed to suitable outlets.

GEOTECHNICAL AND FOUNDATION ISSUES

The Berlogar report concludes the site can be developed as proposed, provided the conclusions
and recommendations presented in the report are incorporated into the project design and
construction. According to Berlogar, the primary geotechnical considerations are landslide
remediation, treatment of existing fill, fill slope construction, stability of proposed cut slopes,
and the potential for expansion and settlement of on-site earth materials.

The primary conclusions and recommendations presented by Berlogar and our associated
comments are summarized in the following sections.

Foundations and Settlement

Berlogar concluded proposed residential structures may be supported on either structural
mat/slab foundations or drilled, cast-in-place concrete piers and grade beams.

Berlogar recommended structural mat/slab foundations should consist of either conventional
reinforced or post-tensioned concrete slab foundations. The mat/slab foundation should be
designed to accommodate two inches of total soil movement and one inch in 25 horizontal feet of
differential soil movement. The mat/slab foundation may be designed for an allowable bearing
pressure of 1,500 pounds per square feet (psf) for static loads; this pressure may be increased by
1/3 for seismic and wind loads. The upper 12 inches of subgrade soil should be presaturated to
at least five percent above optimum moisture content. The presaturated pad should not be
allowed to dry out to less than five percent above optimum moisture content prior to placement
of concrete or moisture break.

Berlogar recommended that drilled piers be designed using a skin friction value of 450 psf; skin
friction derived from the upper foot of soil below adjacent grade should be neglected.

Proposed new residences may be constructed on cut and/or fill slopes. Berlogar estimated that
on-site soil and bedrock material used as fill will settle during and after mass grading. The
Berlogar report indicates fills with a thickness between 5 and 35 feet may experience total
settlement of between 1/4 and 4-1/2 inches, respectively. Berlogar estimates that about 70
percent of the estimated total settlement should occur during mass grading; therefore, maximum
post-grading settlement will be less that about 1-1/2 inches.
Mr. Geoffrey A. Reilly

The Berlogar report also indicates that up to about 32 feet of fill is planned at locations underlain
with colluvium and alluvium that extends to depths of about 25 feet below the ground surface.
Berlogar describes the colluvial and alluvial soil at stiff to very stiff, silty to sandy clay and
clayey sand. Berlogar estimates the settlement of these deposits will be less than about two
inches.

Because fill and bedrock at the site will have different expansion and settlement potentials,
Berlogar indicates that structures and foundations constructed across the transition line between
cut and fill could experience significant differential expansion and/or settlement. To mitigate the
potential for differential movement at cut/fill transition lots, Berlogar recommended
overexcavating the cut portion of the cut/fill transition lots to a depth of about three feet below
rough pad grade and backfilling the overexcavated areas with engineered fill.

T&R generally concurs with Berlogar's recommendations; however, there are several issues that
require technical comments:

Total and Differential Settlement of Fill
To reduce the potential for total and differential settlement of engineering fills, T&R suggests
moisture conditioning new fills that are more than 20 feet below the ground surface to above the
optimum moisture content and to at least 95 percent relative compaction. Subsequently, the
settlement behavior of the new fill should be monitored to confirm that total and differential
settlements are within tolerable limits for the new buildings and site improvements. In addition,
T&R suggests estimating the seismic compression of new fills at the site. Seismic compression
can result in sudden and abrupt ground settlement that can damage new structures and site
improvements.

Split-Level Residences
In T&R's opinion, Berlogar should provide settlement estimates for the upper and lower levels
of the proposed residences. Structural strengthening or stiffening may be required if the
differential settlement between the two levels is too large. Also, below-grade walls will be
needed in the design of the split-level residences. Berlogar should indicate whether a lateral
seismic increment and surcharge load should be included in the design of the below-grade walls
of the new residences.

Mat and Drilled Pier Foundations
Berlogar's mat foundation design recommendations did not provide a minimum depth of mat
embedment. In T&R's opinion, the minimum embedment depth and a requirement for the site
grades to slope away from the proposed buildings will help to reduce the potential for surface
Mr. Geoffrey A. Reilly

water to enter beneath the new buildings, resulting in potential surface water and moisture
intrusion problems. Also, as previously discussed for split-level residences, Berlogar should
indicate whether the proposed mat can achieve bearing support on the soil immediately adjacent
to the below-grade wall.

For the drilled pier and grade beam foundation system, T&R suggests that Berlogar provide
recommendations for the floor slab. Typical floor slab systems consist of either structured floors
that gain support on the pier and grade beam foundation or slab-on-grade floors that bear directly
on the soil subgrade. Additional slab reinforcement may be required if slabs are placed adjacent
to below-grade walls.

Bridge Foundations
The Berlogar report indicates that new bridges should be supported on drilled piers designed in
accordance with Caltrans seismic design criteria. Berlogar recommended drilled piers be
designed with allowable skin friction values of 600 psf for compression and 300 psf for uplift;
these skin frictions may be increased by 1/3 for seismic and wind loads. The upper five feet of
pier embedment should be neglected for skin friction resistance. The drilled piers should be
founded at least 15 feet below lowest adjacent grade.

T&R recommends that Berlogar indicate whether creek scour will have an adverse impact on the
proposed bridge foundations. Also, if the bridges are to be designed in accordance with Caltrans
seismic design criteria, Berlogar should provide recommendations for the 5% damped elastic
acceleration response spectrum (ARS).

Site Grading and Fill Placement
The Berlogar report indicates that onsite soil/rock are suitable for re-use as engineered fill
provided it does not contain rock fragments greater than 12 inches and is free of deleterious
material. Imported fill should have plasticity index less than 12 and approved by the soil
engineer. Fill should be placed in 6- to 8- inch lifts, moisture conditioned to at least three
percent above optimum moisture content, and compacted to at least 90 percent relative
compaction.

Berlogar recommended that fill placed on a slope with inclinations steeper than 7:1 should be
benched into firm materials as determined in the field by the geotechnical engineer. Fill slopes
should be constructed at gradients no steeper than 2:1. Where fill slopes over 30 feet in height,
intermediate surface drainage benches should be spaced no more than 25 feet vertically on the
Mr. Geoffrey A. Reilly

slope. The benches should be a minimum of eight feet wide and include a concrete-lined V ditch
to intercept surface water runoff. Fill slopes should be over built and cut back to expose a firm
compacted surface. Fill slopes should be constructed with a six feet deep (minimum) keyway
with a width equal to 1/2 the slope height or 20 feet, which ever is greater, and constructed with
proper subdrainage.

In general, T&R concurs with the Berlogar recommendations, with the exceptions that T&R
suggests: 1) limiting the maximum size of rocks or lumps in fill to no greater than six inches in
greatest dimension so that loose soil adjacent to large rocks and lumps can be adequately
compacted, and 2) using a higher compaction standard and a lower moisture condition for fill
placed at depths greater than 20 feet below finish grade.

Seismic Design Criteria
Berlogar concluded residential structures be designed in accordance with the 2001 California
Building Code (CBC). Berlogar recommended using the following seismic design criteria:

      seismic zone (Z) of 4
      soil profile type of SD
      seismic source type A
      closest distance to known seismic source (Rodgers Creek fault) of 10 km.


Berlogar concluded bridges should be designed in accordance with the Caltrans seismic design
criteria. Berlogar recommended using the following Caltrans seismic design parameters:
      closest distance to known seismic source (Rodgers Creek fault) of 7 km
      maximum credible earthquake magnitude (Mw) of 7.0
      soil profile type of SD
      peak ground acceleration of 0.5 times gravity.

There is a discrepancy with the closest distance to Rodgers Creek fault. T&R estimates the
closest distance to Rodgers Creek fault is about 8.5 km. Berlogar should re-evaluate the closest
distance to known seismic source and modify the design criteria in accordance with the CBC and
Caltrans methodology, if appropriate.

Surface and Subsurface Drainage
The Berlogar report states that surface drainage benches should be spaced no more than 25 feet
vertically on the slope. The benches should be a minimum of eight feet wide and include a
concrete-lined V ditch to intercept surface water runoff. Berlogar did not address surface
drainage to collect and/or redirect surface water away from the building foundations.

T&R recommends roof downspouts should be connected to tightlines consisting of rigid, PVC
pipe that will convey water to suitable discharge areas. Concrete-lined V ditches should also be
placed at strategic locations to protect slopes. Storm water should not be allowed to pond or
flow in concentrated streams or channels on the site. The homeowner's association or similar
entity should be responsible for inspecting and maintaining the drains for the project.

Berlogar indicated that subsurface drains should be constructed behind retaining walls, on the
uphill side of all keyways and proposed fill, at all spring and seepage areas, at the toes of major
cut slopes, at geologic contacts known to transmit water, and other areas where seepage is
observed during and after grading or as determined in the field by the geotechnical engineer.

T&R believes the design of surface and subsurface systems are important to the success of the
proposed project. Of particular concern is the high susceptibility to erosion of site soils and the
likely presence of weak Franciscan melange adjacent to the sandstone bedrock at or near the site
perimeter (including neighboring properties). Therefore, T&R believes that Berlogar (or other
geologic consultant with experience in surface and groundwater controls) should provide
technical input and review of the surface and subsurface drainage systems for the purpose of
reducing the potential for adverse impacts, such as surface erosion and shallow landslides, on
and adjacent to site. Common design issues that may require technical input from Berlogar
include: 1) the location of surface and subsurface drainage alignments, especially within filled
slopes, 2) selection of water discharge locations, 3) separation of surface and subsurface water
collection pipes, 4) location of pipe cleanouts, and 5) recommendations for controlling
groundwater flow through trench backfill.

Retaining Walls
Berlogar recommended that all retaining walls be designed to resist the active pressure
corresponding to an equivalent fluid weight of 50 pounds per cubic feet (pcf) and 65 pcf for level
and sloped backfill, respectively; and the at-rest pressure corresponding to an equivalent fluid
Mr. Geoffrey A. Reilly
Christopher A. Joseph & Associates
23 November 2004
Page 21


weight of 75 pcf. Berlogar also recommended adequate subdrainage be constructed behind
retaining walls.

Berlogar recommended retaining walls may be designed for an allowable bearing pressure of
2,500 psf for static loads; this pressure may be increased by 1/3 for seismic and wind loads.
Piers used for support of headwalls of the Kelly Creek tributary should be designed per the
parameters presented for bridge foundations.

Due to the relatively close proximity of the Rodgers Creek fault to the site and the potential for
strong ground shaking, T&R suggests that Berlogar consider applying a uniform seismic
increment to the design of new retaining walls at the site. Also, if retaining walls are constructed
adjacent to roadways and/or buildings, appropriate surcharge loads from the adjacent
improvements should also be incorporated in the wall design.

CONCLUSIONS

T&R concludes the proposed project is feasible, but potentially constrained by: 1) strong ground
shaking, 2) slope instabilities associated with existing landslides, potential debris flows, and new
and existing cuts and fills, 3) localized settlement of compacted fill, and 4) impact of scour on
bridge foundations adjacent to existing creek and tributaries. Based on the review of
geotechnical/geological studies presented for this project, T&R concludes the consultants have
performed an adequate geotechnical/geological characterization of the site conditions and
provided suitable geotechnical/geological recommendations for many of the site issues.
However, T&R believes there are several issues that need further evaluation.

Based on the geological/geotechnical third party review, T&R has the following comments that
should be addressed or commented upon by the project applicant. These comments were
previously discussed in this letter and are summarized as follows.

T&R Comment No. 1
The current grading plan shows a concrete headwall, which will create a catchment area for
potential debris flows. T&R recommends that Berlogar evaluate if the headwall is adequate for
resisting the impact forces associated with debris flows and if the catchment area is large enough
to contain the potential debris flow material without adversely impacting the downslope
properties.
Mr. Geoffrey A. Reilly

Page 22


T&R Comment No. 2
T&R suggests that Berlogar evaluate the use of engineered fill that contains Franciscan rock
fragments with dimensions of up to 12 inches, and indicate how adequate soil compaction will be
achieved in areas adjacent to large rock pieces. Also, T&R suggests that Berlogar evaluate the
compaction criteria for deep fills. Specifically, whether 90 percent relative compaction for fills
that are up to about 32 feet high is adequate.

T&R Comment No. 3
T&R suggests that Berlogar evaluate the seismic performance of proposed fill slopes within
areas to receive new buildings and/or site improvements. Subsequently, Berlogar should select a
foundation system(s) that is compatible with the estimated movement or settlement of the fill
slope (if any), and capable of safely supporting the new residences.

T&R Comment No. 4
T&R suggests that Berlogar evaluate the potential for differential settlement between upper and
lower levels of the proposed residences. Berlogar should also indicate whether seismic and
surcharge lateral loads should be incorporated into the design of proposed below-grade walls.

T&R Comment No. 5
T&R suggests that Berlogar provide recommendations for mat foundation embedment or
alternate mitigation to reduce the potential for surface water and moisture intrusion beneath the
new structures.

T&R Comment No. 6
T&R suggests that Berlogar provide recommendations for a ground floor system to be used in
conjunction with a pier and grade beam foundation.

T&R Comment No. 7
T&R suggests that Berlogar evaluate the potential for adverse impacts associated with scour on
bridge and headwall foundations, and if necessary, provide mitigating recommendations.

T&R Comment No. 8
Berlogar should clarify the closest distance to the nearest fault (Rodgers Creek fault) and modify
seismic design parameters (2001 CBC and Caltrans), if appropriate. Also, Berlogar should
provide recommendations for the appropriate ARS curves for use in designing the vehicular
bridge in accordance with Caltrans criteria.
Mr. Geoffrey A. Reilly

T&R Comment No. 9
T&R recommends that a qualified engineering geologist and/or geotechnical engineer should be
retained by the site developer to observe all landslide remediation activities, and check that all
landslide debris within designated excavation areas has been properly removed and engineering
fill, keyways, subdrains, and MSE retaining walls have been properly constructed.

T&R Comment No. 10
The surface and subsurface drainage systems need to be functioning properly in order to reduce
the potential for slope movement, debris flows, and surface erosion. T&R recommends that
Berlogar provide technical input during design and construction of surface and subsurface
drainage systems, including temporary and permanent erosion control systems. Also, the
homeowner's association or similar entity should be responsible for the periodic inspection and
maintenance of surface and subsurface drainage systems for the proposed development.

In conclusion, T&R recommends the project applicant and/or Berlogar provide a response to the
comments presented above. The City of Petaluma should be given an opportunity to review the
responses, and comment on whether any outstanding issues still remain. T&R and GGI
appreciates the opportunity to assist you with the evaluation of geological and geotechnical
issues for this project. If you have any questions or require additional information, please call.

Dear Mr. Reilly:

We are pleased to present this update letter at your request. We have performed
the following tasks based on our 22 June 2012 proposal:

       Review the existing reports and EIR;
       Review aerial photography dated 12/31/05; 8/5/06; 6/30/07; 6/6/09;
        8/25/09; 9/16/10; 5/7/12, more recent than previously reported; and,
       Perform a site reconnaissance to observe present site conditions.

We visited the site on 29 October 2012 to review site conditions that were
originally mapped by our staff geologist on 12 August 2004. We reviewed
Google Earth photography archives for images of the site since 2004 because the
most recent vertical stereo-paired photography available from Pacific Aerial
Surveys is 2005.

We found no significant changes in the state of the site slope stability or level of
erosion. We concur with the findings regarding the site geology presented in the
Draft EIR and concur with the recommended mitigations. If you have any further
questions or require clarification, please call.

Sincerely,

Project Applicant: Marin Community College District

Notice: Notice is hereby given that the Marin Community College District (District), acting as Lead Agency
under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), will receive public comment and recommendations on
a Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) prepared for the New Academic Center at College of Marin,
Kentfield Campus. The review period extends for 45 days beginning December 18, 2012 and ends at 5:00 pm on
January 31, 2013. All comments regarding the Draft EIR must be received by this ending date/time.

Project Location: The project site is located on the central campus of the Kentfield Campus, near the corner of
College Avenue and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.

Project Description: The proposed New Academic Center (NAC) would have a gross floor area of
44,257 square feet excluding the atrium. The building would be three levels with a final building height of two
stories (28 feet) on the College Avenue frontage and also two stories (26 feet) on the main campus level. The
first floor level of the new building would include space for 8 classrooms, including 2 computer labs and an
English as a Second Language (ESL) lab, and a study room, ESL office and workroom mechanical, electrical
and IT rooms. The second level on the main campus level would include 12 classrooms, including a large
120-seat capacity lecture classroom, 15 offices (including offices for the President and Vice-President of the
College), 2 large conference rooms and 2 small conference rooms, reception area, an adjunct office suite that
could be used for part-time faculty, ancillary rooms such as break room, storage room, and file rooms. The upper
level of the building would include 27 offices for faculty and administrative assistants, the Dean's office, and a
large conference room, workroom and copy room. Restroom facilities, IT closets and custodial closets would be
provided on each floor. The NAC would replace four existing older buildings on the same site as follows: Harlan
Center, Business Management Center, Onley Hall and the Administrative Center. The project would also remove
the Taqueria restaurant on the corner of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and College Avenue. The Austin Science
Center, which was originally proposed to be demolished, would be potentially retained. This building is not on or
near the NAC site, but its retention is evaluated as part of the cumulative impact analysis.

Potential Environmental Impacts: No significant, unavoidable impacts have been identified. Some potentially
significant impacts were identified related to aesthetics, air quality, noise, transportation, and public
services/utilities. Each of these impacts would be mitigated to a less than significant level if the identified
mitigation measures are implemented. The District has agreed to implementation of the mitigation measures;
therefore, impacts will be less than significant.

Public Review Period: The public review period for the Draft EIR extends from December 18, 2012 through
January 31, 2013.

Location Where Document Can Be Reviewed: The District has prepared a Draft EIR for the subject project
pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act. This document is available for review at the Swinerton
Management and Consulting on-site offices at 700 College Ave, Bldg PE-8, Kentfield, CA 94904 94607. The
Draft EIR and other associated documents, including the project site plans can also be viewed on the College's
website: http://www.marin.edu.

Comments on the Draft EIR must be received, in writing, by the end of the review period, January 31,
2013, at 5:00 p.m.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction

Environmental Review and Project Overview
The proposed New Academic Center (NAC) would have a gross floor area of 44,257 square feet
excluding the atrium. The building would be three levels with a final building height of two
stories (28 feet) on the College Avenue frontage and also two stories (26 feet) on the main
campus level. The first floor level of the new building would include space for 8 classrooms,
including 2 computer labs and an English as a Second Language (ESL) lab, and a study room,
ESL office and workroom mechanical, electrical and IT rooms. The second level on the main
campus level would include 12 classrooms, including a large 120-seat capacity lecture classroom,
15 offices (including offices for the President and Vice-President of the College), 2 large
conference rooms and 2 small conference rooms, reception area, an adjunct office suite that could
be used for part-time faculty, ancillary rooms such as break room, storage room, and file rooms.
The upper level of the building would include 27 offices for faculty and administrative assistants,
the Dean's office, and a large conference room, workroom and copy room. Restroom facilities, IT
closets and custodial closets would be provided on each floor.

The NAC would replace four existing older buildings on the same site as follows: Harlan Center,
Business Management Center, Onley Hall and the Administrative Center. The project would also
remove the Taqueria restaurant on the corner of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and College
Avenue. The Austin Science Center, which was originally proposed to be demolished, would be
potentially retained. This building is not on or near the NAC site, but its retention is evaluated as
part of the cumulative impact analysis.

The new building would be located in a high elevation portion of the campus at the intersection of
Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and College Avenue. The new project would connect via piping to
the existing geothermal field and Central Plant which is housed in the new Math Science Central
Plant project (under construction) for the project's heating and cooling needs.

The Marin Community College District, as lead agency, determined that preparation of an
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was necessary for the project because there was "substantial
evidence that the proposed project may have a significant effect on the environment" for specific
topic areas. An Initial Study Checklist was prepared and circulated from August 31, 2012 to
October 1, 2012. The Checklist identified the issues that would be the focus of the EIR (see
Appendix C). The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that, before a project
with potentially significant environmental effects may be approved, an EIR must be prepared
that fully describes the environmental effects of the project, identifies mitigation measures to

lessen or eliminate adverse impacts, and examines feasible alternatives to the project. The
information contained in the EIR is to be reviewed and considered by the lead agency prior to
the ultimate decision to approve, disapprove, or modify the proposed project.

This Draft EIR is available for public review for the period indicated on the Public Notice of
Availability of this document. During the public review period, written comments on the
adequacy of the Draft EIR may be submitted to:

         Lesley Lowe, AICP CTP
         Environmental Science Associates
         350 Frank Ogawa Plaza, Suite 300
         Oakland, CA 94612

Written comments may also be submitted via email to llowe@esassoc.com with "COM NAC
DEIR" noted in the subject line.

Responses to all substantive comments received on the adequacy of the Draft EIR and submitted
within the specified review period will be prepared and included in the Responses to
Comments/Final EIR. Prior to approval of the project, the Marin Community College District
Board of Trustees must certify the Final EIR and adopt a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting
Program (MMRP) for mitigation measures identified in the EIR, in accordance with the
requirements of California Public Resources Code (PRC) § 21001.

EIR Guidance
This EIR has been prepared by the Marin Community College District, as lead agency, in
conformance with CEQA. This EIR is intended to provide the information and environmental
analyses necessary to assist the public's understanding of the project and its likely
environmental consequences, and to assist public agency decision-makers in considering the
approvals necessary to implement the proposed project. The proposed project is described to a
sufficient level of detail in Chapter 3 of this document to identify and evaluate any associated
environmental impacts.

The following provisions of the guidelines for implementing CEQA (known as the "CEQA
Guidelines") help define the role of this EIR:

         CEQA Guidelines §15121(a): Informational Document. An EIR is an
         informational document which will inform public agency decision-makers and the
         public generally of the significant environmental effect(s) of a project, identify
         possible ways to minimize the significant effects, and describe reasonable
         alternatives to the project. The public agency shall consider the information in the
         EIR along with other information, which may be presented to the agency.

         CEQA Guidelines §15151: Standards for Adequacy of an EIR. An EIR should
         be prepared with a sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision-makers with
         information which enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes
         account of environmental consequences. An evaluation of the environmental

Draft Environmental Impact Report                                                          December 2012
                                                                                           1. Introduction




         effects of a proposed project need not be exhaustive, but the sufficiency of an
         EIR is to be reviewed in the light of what is reasonably feasible. Disagreement
         among experts does not make an EIR inadequate, but the EIR should summarize the
         main points of disagreement among the experts. The courts have looked not for
         perfection but for adequacy, completeness, and a good faith effort at full
         disclosure.

Further, CEQA states that the lead agency should not "approve projects as proposed if there are
feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the
significant environmental effects of such projects..." (PRC § 21002). If the lead agency
approves the project despite residual significant adverse impacts that cannot be mitigated to less-
than-significant levels, the agency must adopt a "Statement of Overriding Considerations" stating
the reasons for its action in writing.

CEQA Guidelines § 15382 defines a significant effect on the environment as "a substantial, or
potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by
the project..." Therefore, in identifying the significant impacts of the project, this EIR
concentrates on the project's substantial physical effects and on mitigation measures to avoid,
reduce, or otherwise alleviate those effects.

Alternatives to the Project
CEQA requires that an EIR discuss a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed project. This
EIR describes and analyzes a reasonable range of alternatives, including a "No Project" alternative
as required under CEQA (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6[e]). Chapter 5 of this document
discusses the environmental effects of each alternative, compares the environmental effects of
each alternative with the environmental setting and with the effects of the project and each other
alternative, and addresses the relationship of each alternative to the project objectives. The
determinations of the lead agency concerning the feasibility, acceptance, or rejection of each and
all alternatives considered in this EIR will be addressed and resolved in the District's findings,
when the Marin Community College District considers approval of the project, as required by
CEQA.

Environmental Baseline
Under CEQA, the environmental baseline for a proposed project analyzed in an EIR is typically
the physical environmental conditions that exist in the vicinity of the project at the time the
Notice of Preparation (NOP) is published (see Appendix A). The NOP for this project was
published on August 31, 2012, and this is the date assumed for the "baseline" conditions against
which the environmental impacts of the proposed project will be analyzed.

Organization of this EIR
This EIR is organized as follows:

1. Introduction




·        Chapter 1, Introduction, introduces the project, the relevant CEQA requirements, and the
         intended use of the EIR.

·        Chapter 2, Summary, contains an overview of the document and allows the reader to easily
         reference the analysis of potentially significant effects, proposed mitigation measures,
         residual environmental impacts after mitigation, if any, and alternatives to the project that
         reduce or avoid significant effects on the environment. Table 2-1, Summary of Impacts and
         Mitigation Measures, is provided at the end of Chapter 2.

·        Chapter 3, Project Description, identifies the project location and includes a description of
         the project, the objectives of the project, the anticipated phasing of the project, the required
         project approvals, and the other agencies that must consider aspects of the project.

·        Chapter 4, Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures, contains a
         discussion of the setting (existing conditions and regulatory framework), the environmental
         impacts (including cumulative impacts) that could result from the project, and the
         mitigation measures that would reduce or eliminate the identified adverse impacts. As
         appropriate and relevant, the project has been assessed for potential impacts during both
         construction and operation, and mitigation measures are identified accordingly. The
         criteria used to assess the significance of adverse environmental effects are identified,
         and the significance of the impact both before and after mitigation is reported. Further,
         beyond the mitigation measures identified in this EIR, mitigation measures applicable to
         the proposed project as identified in the 2007 Program EIR are shown in Appendix H.

·        Chapter 5, Alternatives to the Project, evaluates a reasonable range of alternatives to the
         proposed project. This chapter provides a discussion of the environmental impacts
         associated with each alternative, compares the relative impacts of each alternative to those
         of the project and the other alternatives, and discusses the relationship of the alternatives
         to the project sponsor's objectives.

·        Chapter 6, Other Statutory Sections, discusses the project's potential for inducing growth
         and summarizes cumulative impacts, unavoidable significant impacts, and effects found not
         to be significant.

·        Chapter 7, Report Preparers, identifies the EIR preparers, including the lead agency staff
         and consultants. Persons and documents consulted during preparation of the EIR are listed
         in the Reference section at the end of each analysis section in Chapter 4.

All reference documents listed at the end of each analysis section in Chapter 4 are available for
public review at the offices of Swinerton Management and Consulting located in Trailer PV 8 at
Parking Lot No. 12 of the Kentfield Campus of the College of Marin.

The Appendices include the Notice of Preparation (NOP), comments received on the NOP,

Notice of Preparation
A Notice of Preparation (NOP) was prepared by Marin Community College District to obtain
comments from agencies and the public regarding issues to be addressed in the EIR. The Notice
of Preparation is included as Appendix A to the EIR.

On August 31, 2012, the District sent the NOP to governmental agencies and organizations and
persons interested in the proposed project to solicit input and to identify any concerns or issues
that should be included in the EIR. The NOP was circulated for 30 days, with the review period
closing on October 1, 2012. Copies of the comments received in responses to the NOP are
included in Appendix B.

This EIR was prepared based on the comments received on the Notice of Preparation and the
project information provided. Environmental factors marked with an "X" below are addressed in
this EIR. It was determined that the environmental factors not designated with an "X" below
would not warrant further discussion in the EIR because they would not involve a potentially
significant impact:

      Aesthetics                                Agricultural Resources                        Air Quality / GHG
      Biological Resources                      Cultural Resources 1                          Geology / Soils

      Utilities / Service Systems               Mandatory Findings of Significance



Intended Uses of the EIR
This EIR provides the environmental information and evaluation necessary for the planning,
construction, and operation of the proposed project. This EIR also provides the CEQA
compliance documentation upon which the District's consideration of, and action on, all
applicable approvals (collectively, "approvals") may be based. These include all approvals set
forth in this EIR, as well as any additional approvals that may be necessary or useful to such
activities such as planning, construction, operation, and maintenance.




1   The historic features of the Administrative Center were addressed in the 2007 Program EIR completed for the Bond
    Spending Implementation Plan for the Kentfield campus, and mitigation measures were identified and adopted for
    the impacts due to proposed demolition (Marin Community College District, 2007).

CHAPTER 2
Summary

Project Under Review
The proposed NAC would have a gross floor area of 44,257 square feet excluding the atrium. The
building would be three levels with a final building height of two stories (28 feet) on the College
Avenue frontage and also two stories (26 feet) on the main campus level. The first floor level of
the new building would include space for 8 classrooms, including 2 computer labs and an English
as a Second Language (ESL) lab, and a study room, ESL office and workroom mechanical,
electrical and IT rooms. The second level on the main campus level would include 12 classrooms,
including a large 120-seat capacity lecture classroom, 15 offices (including offices for the
President and Vice-President of the College), 2 large conference rooms and 2 small conference
rooms, reception area, an adjunct office suite that could be used for part-time faculty, ancillary
rooms such as break room, storage room, and file rooms. The upper level of the building would
include 27 offices for faculty and administrative assistants, the Dean's office, and a large
conference room, workroom and copy room. Restroom facilities, IT closets and custodial closets
would be provided on each floor.

Demolition
The existing Administrative Center, Business Management Center, Olney Hall and Harlan Center
would be demolished because the cost of repairing these buildings and bringing them up to
current building standards would be far greater than replacing the buildings altogether. The
timing of demolition is dependent upon the construction schedule, but would occur prior to the
beginning of any construction associated with the NAC. It is estimated that demolition may begin
late spring of 2013. The demolition of campus buildings was addressed in the 2007 Program EIR
prepared for the Bond Spending Implementation Plan for the Kentfield campus that was certified
in November 2007 and therefore is not addressed herein (Marin Community College District,
2007). At that time it was proposed that the Austin Science Center be demolished. This EIR
evaluates the possible retention of the Austin Science Center as related to potential cumulative
impacts, as the District is now considering retaining this campus building. Detailed assessments
were done by a team of engineers, architects, and specialists in hazards, ventilation, and other
specialties during 2006 (Marin Community College District, 2006c). Full copies of these
assessments can be viewed at the offices of Swinerton Management & Consulting located on the
Kentfield campus, Trailer PV 8 at Parking Lot No. 12, and on the College's website.

2. Summary




Project Objectives
The Marin Community College District is committed to upgrading the College's facilities in
compliance with the Measure C Bond Program. The following objectives have been identified for
the overall Implementation Plan and also apply to the specific currently proposed projects:

1.       Provide functional instructional and administrative space to meet program requirements;
2.       Provide upgrades to the existing Kentfield campus to serve the population in this area;
3.       Provide job training and academic programs to assist the unemployed and underemployed
         in obtaining employment and advancement;
4.       Provide lower division college classes for transfer students to 4-year university programs;
5.       Participate in a collaborative partnership with other educational providers, the business
         community, and local government to better serve the community;
6.       Improve campus facilities to accommodate a total campus population of approximately
         6,400 students at completion of the Bond Spending Implementation Plan;
7.       Focus development within the existing central area of the Kentfield campus;
8.       Meet LEED criteria (even if formal certification is not obtained);
9.       Modernize classrooms, laboratories, and libraries to meet contemporary standards of
         education;
10.      Implement modern computer technology for the campus;
11.      Replace outmoded teaching equipment;
12.      Upgrade buildings for fire safety, energy conservation, seismic safety, and campus security;
13.      Improve disabled access;
14.      Enhance job training;
15.      Implement "green building" practices in all capital improvement projects; and

16.      Locate the New Academic Center in such a way that valuable campus open space is not
         compromised and the "Central Green" is maintained.

Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures
The EIR addresses the potential for environmental impacts of constructing and operating the
proposed project based on the adopted CEQA Guidelines significance criteria. Each topic (e.g.,
aesthetics, noise, air quality, etc.) is addressed in detail in Chapter 4 of this EIR. The less than
significant impacts do not require mitigation measures and thus are not addressed in Table 2-1
which summarizes all the potentially significant impacts and the recommended mitigation
measures. Potentially significant impacts were identified for the following topics:

·        Transportation and Traffic                   ·     Aesthetics

·        Air Quality                                ·      Public Services, Utilities, and Energy
·        Noise                                      ·      Greenhouse Gases

Significant Unavoidable Impacts
The EIR analyses identified no significant unavoidable impacts.

Alternatives
Alternatives to the proposed project are addressed in detail in Chapter 5 of the EIR and are
summarized as follows:

         No Project Alternative: Under this alternative, the construction of the NAC would not
         occur. The Administrative Center, Business Management Center, Olney Hall and Harlan
         Center would be retained. However, as discussed in the 2007 Program EIR, the cost of
         repairing these buildings and bringing them up to current building standards would be far
         greater than replacing the buildings altogether. Thus, retention of these buildings could
         create a public safety risk due to the buildings' condition and the result would not meet
         program needs for the project. The Taqueria restaurant and associated parking would
         remain at the corner of College Avenue and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and the Austin
         Science Center would be retained under this alternative.

         Smaller Footprint Alternative: This alternative assumes a smaller footprint for the NAC
         to mitigate potential visual impacts along College Avenue. The removal of the four onsite
         buildings would still occur. The design of the building, other than along College Avenue,
         would remain unchanged. Along College Avenue, a portion of the first and second floor
         would be removed to "visually divide" this frontage and to reduce the long façade along
         College Avenue. Otherwise, the basic footprint would remain unchanged. The Austin
         Science Center would be retained under this alternative.

Other alternatives were considered for evaluation but were rejected for reasons that are addressed
in Chapter 5.

Areas of Controversy
A Notice of Preparation (NOP) regarding the preparation of this EIR was published on
August 31, 2012 and distributed for public and agency review. Comments received on the NOP
are included in Appendix B of this EIR. The NOP identified the potential for significant impacts
on the environment related to the following topics that are addressed in Chapter 4 of the EIR:

·        Transportation and Traffic                 ·      Aesthetics
·        Air Quality                                ·      Public Services, Utilities, and Energy
·        Noise                                      ·      Greenhouse Gases

Project Description

Introduction
The Marin Community College District Board of Trustees, hereinafter referred to as the Trustees,
will serve as the lead agency for the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) document for
the proposed New Academic Center (referred to herein as "NAC") proposed on the Kentfield
campus of the College of Marin.

The NAC was addressed in the Program Environmental Impact Report (Program EIR) completed
for the Bond Spending Implementation Plan (hereinafter also referred to as the Implementation
Plan) for the Kentfield campus that was certified on November 7, 2007 (Marin Community
College District, 2007). The Implementation Plan is the outcome of and the guiding document for
the Measure C Bond Program that was passed by the Marin County voters in 2004. This bond
program provided $249.5 million to be used for modernization and new construction at the
District's campuses ­ the Kentfield campus and the Indian Valley campus.

A Program EIR was prepared to address overall changes on the Kentfield campus because
specific details about some of the proposed buildings were not yet available at the time of the
Program EIR, including details about the NAC. It was understood that further environmental
review might be necessary when such details were known. Now, floor plans and detailed plans
have been developed for the NAC addressed herein. The Trustees will be responsible for adopting
a Focused EIR certifying that the proposed project meets all the requirements of the CEQA. After
the certification of the Final EIR for the NAC, the new project can be approved. Construction
would also require the prior approval of the Division of the State Architect (DSA).

Detailed floor plans and other drawings can be reviewed at the Swinerton Management &
Consulting Offices, Trailer PV8, Parking Lot No. 12 of the Kentfield campus. The 2007 Program
EIR and other associated documents can be viewed on the College's website
(http://www.marin.edu/MeasureC/public_notices/index.htm). The 2007 Program EIR on the
Bond Spending Implementation Plan for College of Marin: Kentfield Campus (2007-2013) is
incorporated herein by reference.

Project Location and Site Characteristics
The Kentfield campus is located in central Marin County in the unincorporated community of
Kentfield. The main access to the 87-acre campus is provided via Sir Francis Drake Boulevard




College of Marin New Academic Center          3-1                                      ESA / 210307

and College Avenue. Other roads abutting the campus include Laurel Avenue and Kent Avenue.
A regional and project location map is provided in Figure 3-1.

Major highway access to the project site is available from U.S. Highway 101, about 2 miles east
of the campus. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard is a main exit from this highway for those coming
from the north, south, and east. For those coming from west Marin County, the main access to the
campus is from Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, which provides access to San Anselmo, Fairfax,
Point Reyes, Inverness, and other communities to the west.

The Kentfield campus (see Figure 3-1) includes about 13 acres which are developed as the
"main" campus where most of the academic buildings are concentrated and where the proposed
NAC would be located. Corte Madera Creek has been channelized in a concrete channel and
forms the southern boundary of the main campus (see Figure 3-1). Two bridges currently provide
both pedestrian and emergency vehicle access across the creek to the main campus.

The NAC would replace four existing older buildings on the same site as follows: Harlan Center,
Business Management Center, Onley Hall and the Administrative Center. The project would also
remove the Taquiera restaurant on the corner of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and College
Avenue. A site plan for the NAC is shown in Figure 3-2. The proposed NAC would be a new
building located near the intersection of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and College Avenue.
Elevation in this area of the campus ranges from about 14 feet above mean sea level (msl) to
32 feet above msl. The topographic variation for the project site is approximately 15 feet. The
estimated area of disturbance for the project is approximately three acres. New piping would
connect to the existing geothermal field and Central Plant which is housed in the new Math
Science Central Plant project (under construction) for the NAC's heating and cooling needs.

Project Need
The District has undertaken a number of studies to evaluate the existing condition of buildings at
the Kentfield campus. The first study was the "Facility Condition Assessment Report" undertaken
in 2003 by 3D/I (3D/I, 2003). This report formed the basis of the requested improvements for the
Measure C Bond Program that was approved by the County's voters in 2004. Many of the
Kentfield campus buildings are in a state of disrepair and two are seismically unsafe. The
proposed project responds to the seismic and other conditions related to existing buildings.

The Austin Science Center (51,236 square feet) in the vicinity of Parking Lot 6 was originally
planned for removal as part of the Implementation Plan. This Center is now proposed to be
potentially retained and to be used for general education classrooms. The Austin Science Center
includes 18 lecture classrooms (648-person capacity), 1 large lecture class (108-person capacity),
2 computer labs (125-person capacity), offices, conference rooms, a storage and maintenance
rooms. The total person capacity of the Austin Science Center is approximately 975 persons.

The student population is not expected to change as a result of retaining Austin Science Center.
The building would be retained due to the educational functionality of its teaching spaces, not for
growth purposes. The building is located within the 100-year floodplain. Garage parking forms
the ground level of the building and classrooms are elevated. The location of the Austin Science
Center in the 100-year floodplain is an existing condition and thus no new impacts would be
created as related to hydrological conditions. This CEQA evaluation will address both the NAC
and the retention of the Austin Science Center.

Bond Spending Implementation Provisions
At completion of the entire Implementation Plan (estimated to be 2016), the campus is expected
to have an enrollment of about 6,400 students, which is about a four percent increase (one percent
per year) over the 2011-2012 enrollment (6,184 students). The retention of the Austin Science
Center is not expected to alter this estimated enrollment which is unchanged from what was
assumed in the Program EIR. As such, the proposed NAC and retention of the Austin Science
Center would have no growth-inducing impacts for the campus. The Implementation Plan would
now provide for a net addition in building square footage of 8,000 to 11,000 gross square feet
(gsf) on the Kentfield campus. The Implementation Plan originally estimated a reduction of
square footage of 40,000 to 45,000 gsf, as Austin Science Center was assumed to be removed.

Project Characteristics
The proposed NAC would have a gross floor area of 44,257 square feet excluding the atrium. The
2007 Program EIR assumed a similar square footage (48,000 gsf) and a building height of two
stories. 1 The building would be three levels with a final building height of two stories (28 feet) on
the College Avenue frontage and also two stories (26 feet) on the main campus level. The first
floor level of the new building would include space for 8 classrooms, including 2 computer labs
and an English as a Second Language (ESL) lab, and a study room, ESL office and workroom
mechanical, electrical and IT rooms. The second level on the main campus level would include
12 classrooms, including a large 120-seat capacity lecture classroom, 15 offices (including offices
for the President and Vice-President of the College), 2 large conference rooms and 2 small
conference rooms, reception area, an adjunct office suite that could be used for part-time faculty,
ancillary rooms such as break room, storage room, and file rooms. The upper level of the building
would include 27 offices for faculty and administrative assistants, the Dean's office, and a large
conference room, workroom and copy room. Restroom facilities, IT closets and custodial closets
would be provided on each floor. Figures 3-3 through 3-6 provide a bird's eye view of the project
and an artist's rendering of the proposed project.




1   The 48,000 square foot NAC was addressed as Alternative 4 in the Program EIR for the Implementation Plan and
    this alternative was selected by the Marin Community College Board of Trustees.

3. Project Description




Demolition
The existing Administrative Center, Business Management Center, Olney Hall and Harlan Center
would be demolished because the cost of repairing these buildings and bringing them up to
current building standards would be far greater than replacing the buildings altogether. The
Taqueria restaurant would also be demolished. The timing of demolition is dependent upon the
construction schedule, but would occur prior to the beginning of any construction associated with
the NAC. It is estimated that demolition may begin late spring of 2013. The demolition of campus
buildings was addressed in the 2007 Program EIR and therefore is not addressed herein. Detailed
assessments were done by a team of engineers, architects, and specialists in hazards, ventilation,
and other specialties during 2006 (Marin Community College District, 2006c). Full copies of
these assessments can be viewed at the offices of Swinerton Management & Consulting located
on the Kentfield campus, Trailer PV 8 at Parking Lot No. 12, and on the College's website.

Site Improvements: Landscaping, Utilities, and Site Access
In addition, the project would include overall site improvements such as new landscaping, new
pathways, and new utility lines (water, wastewater, gas, electricity, and telecommunications).
These site improvements were adequately evaluated in the Program EIR and thus are not
addressed in detail herein.

Landscaping
The main areas proposed for new landscape improvements include a new courtyard area, the area
between the new Fine Arts Building and the proposed project as well as the corner of Sir Francis
Drake Boulevard and College Avenue. Figure 3-7 illustrates the proposed landscaping for the
NAC.

No redwood trees would be removed for the project; however, up to 47 other types of trees would
be removed for the new construction. Of these, five would have trunks larger than 23 inches
(measured at diameter breast height), 18 would have trunks between 12 and 23 inches, and 24
would have trunks between 6 and 12 inches. Of the large trees to be removed, one would be a
Valley oak, one would be a Coast live oak, and one would be a Cork oak. Two of the identified
large oak trees (i.e., Coast live oak and Valley oak) have tree hazard reports from a qualified
independent arborist and have been recommended for removal. As mitigation for the removal of
oak trees, the District proposes to replant new oak trees in the Ecological Reserve Area of the
campus on the east side of Corte Madera Creek. Up to four new Valley oaks are proposed for
replanting in this area, to be accompanied by removal of certain invasive, non-native species such
as acacia. The replanting would occur prior to completion of the proposed project. In the vicinity
of the project, 21 new trees (including three Heritage river birches, five Katsura trees, four
Eastern redbuds, one Valley oak, four Coast redwoods, and 2 Japanese Stewartias) would be
planted.

3. Project Description




The Design Guidelines for the Kentfield campus address the goal of new plantings that are native,
drought-tolerant, and low maintenance. It should also be noted that campus landscaping would
continue to be irrigated by the District's well. These same guidelines address paving materials,
irrigation, seatwalls and stairs, lighting, site furnishings, and a number of other elements in the
design of the new improvements that would be considered in the overall design of the NAC
(Marin Community College District, 2006a).

Outdoor lighting would be designed to maximize public safety and security while minimizing
visual intrusion to adjacent residential areas. Outdoor light fixtures would include shrouds and
other shielding as appropriate. Lighting along pedestrian corridors would be low-level lights. To
the extent practicable, area lighting and security lighting would be controlled by the use of an
energy management system (EMS) and/or motion detector activation to reduce energy
consumption.

Utility Lines
A number of utility improvements would be made on the Kentfield campus for water, natural gas,
wastewater, telecommunications (phone, fiber optics, and other signal systems), and storm
drainage. Some of these would be done for the NAC. These utility improvements were addressed
in the Program EIR.

Existing domestic water supply to the campus is from the Marin Municipal Water District. As
practicable and as required by code, pipes and fire hydrants would be replaced and/or added
during construction. Sanitary sewer service is provided by Ross Valley Sanitary District. Some
existing on-site sewer lines would be replaced and some would be relocated.

All telecommunication services for this project would be supplied from the Central Plant and
routed in a joint trench to the new building. This trench would also include other services
required in the project, including fiber optics, and chilled water. Electrical service would be
supplied from the existing service on the central campus.

Site Access
Access to the NAC would primarily be from pedestrian pathways connecting the NAC site to
interior portions of the main campus. Some paths would connect to Circle Drive located north of
the site, and to College Avenue located at the eastern edge of the site. Vehicular drop-offs could
occur on College Avenue and Circle Drive. Circle Drive provides the only parking in the
immediate vicinity of the NAC. Additional parking would be available on one of the many
campus parking lots. The nearest lots to the NAC would be Lot 3 (Circle Drive); Lot No. 2
located on the north side of Sir Francis Drake Blvd., north of the NAC site; Parking Lot No. 5
located south of the NAC; or Parking Lot No. 6 located south of the NAC site on the south side of
Corte Madera Creek.

Building Occupancy
The NAC would be occupied by a maximum of 1,021 people at any one time. The classrooms
would hold up to 854 students, and offices would provide space for 79 persons. If the conference

rooms were also used at the same time, up to 88 individuals could use the provided conference
rooms.

Construction Timing
Construction of the NAC is expected to begin in 2013 and to be completed by 2015. As related to
the overall Implementation Plan, this project would be the last major new building to be
constructed on the campus. As of 2012, the Science/Math/Central Plant and the Performing Arts
Building were under construction. The new Child Study Center (CSC) construction, located at the
Larkspur Annex of the Kentfield campus was begun in 2012. The existing CSC located in the
Administrative Center, proposed to be demolished, would require relocation to allow construction
of the NAC.

Site Grading and Construction Staging
Site development would require moderate grading in the areas of demolished buildings and to
prepare the site for the new building. Demolition of existing buildings was addressed in the 2007
Program EIR and thus is not addressed herein. The project would require approximately
7,500 cubic yards (cy) of cut and 2,300 cy of fill, for a net off-haul of 5,200 cy of dirt.

Construction trailers and parking are proposed to be located at the site of the existing Taqueria
restaurant on the corner of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and College Avenue. The NAC would
have construction supplies and equipment stored on site. Access to the site for construction
vehicles would be from Circle Drive via Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and Laurel Avenue.
Construction worker vehicle parking would occur on the site.

Energy-Efficient Design
The NAC would be designed with efficient heating and cooling systems beginning with the
orientation of the buildings on the site and the placement of the windows on the buildings to
maximize natural winter heat gain and minimize summer heat gain. Furthermore, the project
would be constructed of building systems that provide appropriate levels of thermal protection.
Skylights and clearstory windows would assist in providing required lighting. A geothermal
system is under construction to reduce energy consumption for campus buildings. All proposed
project heating and cooling requirements would be supplied by the existing geothermal system
from the central plant pumps.

Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Compliance
The District is committed to meeting certain criteria established by the Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) certification program, which allots points for various energy-
saving and environmentally preferable features. All design and engineering firms hired by the
District to work on the Bond projects have LEED-certified professionals on their staff assigned to
the District projects. In addition, the District is using a LEED-certified commissioning agent for
enhanced commissioning of all systems on new projects. The District's goal is to meet the criteria
of LEED even if certification is not formally obtained. Also, "green building" design principles
are addressed at length in the Design Goals, Principles, Guidelines (Volume IB) document of the
Bond Spending Implementation Plan.

·        Use of high recycled content materials for interior design

Hours of Operation and Construction
Hours of operation at the Kentfield campus are typically 8:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M., Monday
through Friday. Many classes are offered on weekends.

During the construction period, construction would typically occur between 7:00 A.M. and
5:00 P.M., Monday through Friday and between 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. on Saturdays as per the
mitigation measures of the Program EIR.

Project Objectives
The Marin Community College District is committed to upgrading the College's facilities in
compliance with the Measure C Bond Program. The following objectives have been identified for
the overall Implementation Plan and are modified to also apply to the specific currently proposed
project:

1.       Provide functional instructional and administrative space to meet program requirements;
2.       Provide upgrades to the existing Kentfield campus to serve the population in this area;

         education;
10.      Implement modern computer technology for the campus;
11.      Replace outmoded teaching equipment;
12.      Upgrade buildings for fire safety, energy conservation, seismic safety, and campus security;
13.      Improve disabled access;
14.      Enhance job training;
15.      Implement "green building" practices in all capital improvement projects; and

16.      Locate the New Academic Center in such a way that valuable campus open space is not
         compromised and the "Central Green" is maintained.

Project Approval and Funding Process
The Marin Community College District is the principal authority for the proposed project. The
Board of Trustees for the District would be responsible for adopting the Focused EIR for the
proposed project. The following additional agencies would be involved in discretionary approvals
and permits required for various project components:

·        The Department of the State Architect (DSA) reviews community college project designs
         to determine compliance with the California Building Code, CAL Green Code, including
         fire/life safety, structural integrity, and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
         requirements.
·        The State Fire Marshal's Office has delegated fire code regulatory responsibilities for
         community college facilities to DSA.
·        The Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) oversees the permitting for projects
         that could affect water quality. The project would be covered under the State National
         Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Construction Permit, which is
         accomplished by filing a Notice of Intent (NOI) with the RWQCB. A Storm Water
         Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) will be required for the project.

CHAPTER 4
Environmental Setting, Impacts, and
Mitigation Measures

This Draft EIR has been prepared in accordance with CEQA, as amended (Public Resources
Code § 21000, et seq.), and the CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations § 15000
through 15378).

This chapter contains the analysis of the potential effects on the environment considered under
CEQA, from development of the proposed New Academic Center (NAC) on the Kentfield
campus of the College of Marin. This chapter describes the existing setting for each topic, the
potential impacts that could result from the construction and operation of the NAC, and relevant
plans and policies that would minimize or avoid potential adverse environmental impacts that
could result. Finally, this chapter identifies mitigation measures necessary to reduce the potential
impacts resulting from the proposed project.

The following provides an overview of the scope of the analysis included in this chapter,
organization of the sections and, the methods for determining significant impacts.

Environmental Topics
The following sections in this chapter analyze the environmental topics as listed below and
presented in the Table of Contents at the front of this document:

4.A Aesthetics                                     4.D Transportation and Circulation
4.B Air Quality                                    4.E Public Services, Utilities, and Energy
4.C Noise                                          4.F Greenhouse Gases

The remaining topics outlined in Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines were determined to have a
less than significant impact on the environment in the Initial Study, and are not further discussed
in this EIR. The Initial Study is presented in Appendix C of this EIR.

Format of Environmental Topic Sections, Impact
  Statements and Mitigation Measures
Each environmental topic section generally includes two main subsections:




College of Marin New Academic Center             4-1                                        ESA / 210307
Draft Environmental Impact Report                                                          December 2012
4. Environmental Setting, Impacts, Standard Conditions of Approval and Mitigation Measures




·        Existing Setting - includes baseline conditions, regulatory setting, Thresholds/Criteria of
         Significance; and

·        Impacts and Mitigation Measures - identifies and discusses the potential impacts and
         mitigation measures that would, to the extent possible, reduce or eliminate adverse impacts
         identified in this chapter.

This EIR identifies all impacts with an alpha designation that corresponds to the environmental
topic addressed in each section (e.g., "NOISE" for Section 4.D, Noise). The topic designator is
followed by a number that indicates the sequence in which the impact statement occurs within the
section. For example, "Impact NOISE-1" is the first (i.e., "1") noise impact identified in the EIR.
All impact statements are presented in bold text.

The Impact Classification of the project's effects prior to implementation of mitigation measures
is stated in parentheses immediately following the impact statement.

Similarly, each mitigation measure is numbered to correspond with the impact that it addresses.
Where multiple mitigation measures address a single impact, each mitigation measure is
numbered sequentially. For example "Mitigation Measure NOISE-1" is the first mitigation
identified to address the first noise impact (i.e., "NOISE-1").

Beyond the mitigation measures identified in this EIR, mitigation measures applicable to the
proposed project as identified in the 2007 Program EIR are shown in Appendix H.

Thresholds/Criteria of Significance
The CEQA Guidelines § 15382 defines a significant effect on the environment as "a substantial,
or potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area
affected by the project, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and
objects of historic or aesthetic significance. An economic or social change by itself shall not be
considered a significant effect on the environment. A social or economic change related to a
physical change may be considered in determining whether the physical change is significant."
Determinations of significance vary with the physical conditions affected and the setting in which
the change occurs. The significance criteria used in this EIR are the thresholds for determining
significance of potential impacts and are based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines.

Impact Classifications
The following level of significance classifications are used throughout the impact analysis in this EIR:

·        Less than Significant (LS) ­ The impacts of the proposed project do not reach or exceed
         the defined Threshold/Criteria of Significance. Generally, no mitigation measure is
         required for a LS impact.

·        Significant (S) ­ The impact of the proposed project is expected to reach or exceed the
         defined Threshold/Criteria of Significance. Feasible mitigation measures are identified to
         reduce the significant impact to a less than significant level.

                                       4. Environmental Setting, Impacts, Standard Conditions of Approval and Mitigation Measures




·        Significant Unavoidable (SU) ­ The impact of the proposed project reaches or exceeds the
         defined Threshold/Criteria of Significance. No feasible mitigation measure is available to
         reduce the S impact to LS. In these cases, feasible mitigation measures are identified to
         reduce the S impact to the maximum feasible extent, and the significant impact is
         considered SU. Impacts are also classified as SU if a feasible mitigation measure is identified
         that would reduce the impact to LS, but the approval and/or implementation of the
         mitigation measure is not within the District's sole control, in which case the analysis cannot
         presume implementation of the mitigation measure and the resulting LS impact. It is
         important to clarify that SU is an impact classification that only applies after consideration
         of possible mitigation measures.

·        No Impact (N) ­ No noticeable adverse effect on the environment would occur.

Environmental Baseline
Overall, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines §15125(a), this EIR measures the physical impacts of the
proposed project (i.e., the development and operation of the NAC) against a "baseline" of
physical environmental conditions at and in the vicinity of the project site. The environmental
"baseline" is the combined circumstances existing around the time the Notice of Preparation of
the EIR was published, which is August 31, 2012. In most cases, the baseline condition relevant
to the environmental topic being analyzed is described within each environmental topic section in
this chapter. In some cases (such as Section 4.A, Aesthetics), discussion of the baseline condition
is detailed or restated in the Impacts Analysis to provide the impact analysis in the most reader-
friendly format and organization.

Cumulative Analysis
Approach to the Cumulative Analysis
CEQA defines cumulative as "two or more individual effects which, when considered together,
are considerable, or which can compound or increase the other environmental impacts." CEQA
Guidelines § 15130 requires that an EIR evaluate potential environmental impacts when the
project's incremental effect is cumulatively considerable. "Cumulatively considerable" means
that the incremental effects of an individual project are significant when viewed in connection
with the effects of past, present, existing, approved, pending and reasonably foreseeable future
projects. These impacts can result from a combination of the proposed project together with other
projects causing related impacts. "The cumulative impact from several projects is the change in the
environment which results from the incremental impact of the project when added to other closely
related past, present, and reasonable foreseeable probable future projects." The analysis approach
for this EIR included "past, present, existing, approved, pending and reasonably foreseeable
future projects."

Cumulative Context
The context used for assessing cumulative impacts typically varies depending on the specific
topic being analyzed to reflect the different geographic scope of different impact areas. For

example, considerations for the cumulative air quality analysis are different from those used for
the cumulative analysis of aesthetics. In assessing aesthetic impacts, only development within the
vicinity of the project would contribute to a cumulative visual effect. In assessing air quality
impacts, on the other hand, all development within the air basin contributes to regional emissions
of criteria pollutants, and basin-wide projections of emissions is the best tool for determining the
cumulative effect. Accordingly, the geographic setting and other parameters of each cumulative
analysis discussion can vary.

The cumulative analysis for water demand, wastewater generation, solid waste generation, and
energy usage (i.e., topics influenced by physical construction activity, direct population and or
user demand) was based on evaluating the project and the cumulative development in the context
of the overall campus development, including the potential retention of the Austin Science
Center.

The cumulative analysis for traffic and the related air quality, GHG/climate change, and noise
were based on existing counts (reflecting past and present projects) and growth reflected in the
Transportation Authority of Marin (TAM) travel demand model projections, which reflects traffic
from projects countywide and that were applied to develop 2018 and 2035 traffic growth
projections for project study roadways (as described in Section 4.D, Transportation and
Circulation, and in Appendix G to this Draft EIR). Past and present cumulative projects are
primarily reflected in the existing or near-term conditions reported for certain environmental
topics. All the cumulative projects considered for this analysis are presented in Chapter 6, under
Cumulative Impacts. The main cumulative projects in the project vicinity that would contribute to
the cumulative setting are:

·        The Marin General Hospital Master Plan. The proposed Master Plan consists of the phased
         development of the Marin General Hospital to include a 300,000 square-foot Hospital
         Replacement Building, a 100,000 square-foot Ambulatory Services Building, a 401-space
         Hillside Parking Structure, a 501-space Bon Air Road Parking Structure, and an elevated
         pedestrian access bridge from the Bon Air Road Parking Structure to the Hospital
         Replacement Building and the Ambulatory Services Building. In addition, the project
         would renovate existing wings of the existing hospital. Site work to relocate existing
         utilities and to develop new utilities that would service the proposed new buildings would
         occur, as well as overall site improvements and amenities, such as landscaping. The
         hospital is located northeast of the project site at 250 Bon Air Road, Greenbrae,
         approximately half a mile to the northeast.

·        The Buildout of the Kentfield Campus Implementation Plan which includes the
         construction of five new buildings in the central campus area and the demolition of
         15 existing buildings, for a total loss in square footage. 1 This includes the Child Study
         Center that is currently under construction on the Larkspur Annex.

Generally, this list of projects, was used to identify past, present, existing, approved, pending and
reasonably foreseeable future projects in the vicinity of the proposed project. It should be noted,

1   This overall campus development was addressed in the 2007 Draft and Final EIR for the Kentfield Campus Bond
    Spending Implementation Plan (Marin Community College District, 2007). The possible retention of Austin
    Science Center would now result in an overall increase of square footage on the main campus.

however, that the list approach is not intended as an inclusive list of cumulative projects
considered in this EIR. As discussed above, cumulative projects considered in the cumulative
context can vary by environmental topic; therefore, some of those listed above may not be
directly relevant to the cumulative context, depending on the environmental topic.

In some cases, the cumulative context may include more development than the specific known
projects. A primary example is the transportation analyses (and transportation-related traffic and
air quality), which uses a growth rate to account for background traffic from projects Countywide
and the broader regional context. Alternatively, as mentioned above, the aesthetics analysis would
primarily consider projects within the viewsheds of the project site, which may not, for example,
include projects on the list that are located in distant areas.

The cumulative discussions in each topical section throughout this chapter describe the
cumulative geographic context considered for each topic at a level appropriate to the program-
level analysis presented in this EIR. Cumulative impacts from the proposed project, per CEQA
Guidelines §15130, are further address in Chapter 6 of this EIR, under B. Cumulative Impacts.

A. Aesthetics
Introduction
This section discusses the existing visual conditions at the project site and vicinity, and considers
the potential visual effects of the proposed project with respect to visual character, scenic and public
views, and light and glare. This visual impact analysis is based on field observations at the project
site and vicinity, and a review of the project's architectural plans and visual simulations
completed for the project.

Environmental Setting
Regional Setting
The project site and College of Marin main campus is set within the larger context of central
Marin County, a suburban area dominated by low- to medium-density residential development,
shopping centers, and smaller commercial districts housing retail and/or office development.
Parks and open space areas are scattered throughout the area, with the most dominant ones in the
nearby vicinity being the larger Mount Tamalpais State Park about 3.5 miles to the southwest of
the main campus and the Hal Brown Park at Creekside, a local park of 26 acres east of the project
site. The terrain is variable with large expanses of level topography interspersed with many low-
lying hillsides. Views from roadways that can be constrained by hillsides in one area open up to
long-distance vistas when the terrain becomes more level. Mount Tamalpais (elevation of
2,574 feet above mean sea level) forms the dominant visual feature from many locations in this
portion of Marin County as well as from many campus locations.

Visual Character
The NAC project site is located at the northeastern corner of the College of Marin Kentfield
campus immediately adjacent to College Avenue. The project site is bounded by College Avenue
to the east, Sir Francis Drake Boulevard to the north, the campus Learning Resources Center to
the south, and the "Central Green" to the west. As shown in Figure 4.A-1a, the site as viewed
along College Avenue is a combination of existing buildings and native and non-native mature
trees that screen Olney Hall and the Administrative Center from view. The main built element
visible for northbound motorists at this location on College Avenue is the arched entry over the
Olney Hall entrance. The mature trees include a mixture of deciduous and evergreen trees with
trunk diameters ranging from 8 inches to 24 inches (as measured at breast height) (RHAA, 2012).
The existing trees along the College Avenue frontage of the project site include the following:
four Pinus canariensis, one Pinus radiata, one Quercus agrifolia, one Fraxinus ornus, two
Leptospermum laevigatum (multi-trunked), one Magnolia denudata, one Fraxinus holotricha, and
one Juniperus chinensis `Torulosa'. From farther south on College Avenue, additional street trees
provide even more screening of the project site (see Figure 4.A-1b) as street trees are located
close to the Corte Madera Creek crossing. In both images, the Kentfield Fire Department building
is visible in the background (right side of image).

The other main portion of the site where significant tree cover is visible from locations off the site
includes the corner of College Avenue and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. Currently, this corner is
occupied by the Taqueria restaurant and about 17 parking spaces that serve the restaurant. Four
large redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) ranging in trunk diameter from 12 inches to 24 inches are
planted at the edge of the sidewalk in this location (see Figure 4.A-2a).

A grove of about 13 redwood trees is located to the west and northwest of the Taqueria restaurant,
north of Harlan Center (see Figure 4.A-2b). The existing tree canopy forms the major visual
element of this corner of the site as seen by passing motorists on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.
Within the more central portions of the site and surrounding the Business Center, mature trees
include a mixture of oaks, Japanese maples, magnolias, liquidambars, and maytens.

The project site is currently occupied by Olney Hall, the Administrative Center, the Business Center,
Harlan Center, and the Taqueria Restaurant. All of these buildings would be removed to allow
construction of the proposed project. These existing buildings are separated by small landscaped areas
which include pathways, stairs, turf areas, and mature trees. The architectural style of many of the
existing buildings on the project site is "Mission revival" style, with distinguishing features being
the red tile roofs, cement plaster siding, exterior arcades, exposed rafters, and operable windows.
The Administrative Center also includes historically-significant architectural features such as
arcade columns with concrete cast ornamentation.1 Harlan Center is a two-story building that is
most visible from interior portions of the campus and that does not include the Mission revival
style elements found in many of the other onsite buildings. This building includes brick siding
and shingle roofing as shown in Figure 4.A-3a and 4.A-3b. A large beech tree located northwest
of Harlan Center screens much of the building from view as seen from Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard (see Figure 4.A-4). 2 From Maple Avenue, which intersects Sir Francis Drake
Boulvard, Harlan Center is not screened by the beech tree.

The site varies in topography with the lower portions of the site along College Avenue and
adjacent to Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, and the upper portions of the site farther to the west
adjacent to the "Central Green". A series of stairways provides pedestrian access to the upper
portions of the site. No parking is provided on the site and the nearest parking is adjacent to
College Avenue at the southeast corner of the Learning Resources Center.




1   The historic features of the Administrative Center were addressed in the 2007 Program EIR completed for the Bond
    Spending Implementation Plan for the Kentfield campus, and mitigation measures were identified and adopted for
    the impacts due to proposed demolition (Marin Community College District, 2007).
2   The large beech tree is outside the limit of work and would be retained.

Scenic Vistas/Public Views
Primary public views of the site occur from College Avenue and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, from
the adjacent commercial uses on the east sides of College Avenue, from a few residences on Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard, and from nearby uphill residential areas. Views of the project site vary
depending on the vantage point and the distance from the site. In general, views from College
Avenue are primarily of the frontage tree cover along the perimeter of the site (see Figure 4.A-1a
and 4.A-1b). Mt. Tamalpais is visible in the background of some of the views along College
Avenue but is partially screened by the large existing trees along College Avenue. From Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard, much of the site is screened by existing mature trees such as the grove
of redwoods and the large beech tree near Harlan Center (see Figures 4.A-2, 3 and 4). Views of
Mt. Tamalpais are most prominent near the northwestern portion of the site, where one can look
from Sir Francis Drake Boulevard towards the mountain, with the existing Harlan Center at the
left of this image and the lawn by Circle Drive in the foreground (see Figure 4.A-4).
Mt. Tamalpais is also visible above the rooftops of the onsite buildings for southbound motorists
and pedestrians on College Avenue, but this view is partially screened by intervening trees and
buildings.

Light and Glare
Due to the adjacent commercial, institutional, and residential development in the project vicinity,
the sources of light and glare near the project site are primarily vehicles on public roadways,
lighting in parking lots and along public streets, and building and parking security lighting. Vehicle
headlights on public roadways, on adjacent properties, and on the project site emit temporary
lighting in their direction of travel. Existing buildings on the project site and adjacent paths include
lighting visible during nighttime hours.

Regulatory Framework
Federal and State
No federal regulations related to visual quality would pertain to the project. The State of
California has a formal program related to scenic highways. The California Scenic Highway
Program, established in 1963, identifies and designates certain highways along which adjoining
land uses and features require special conservation treatment. The responsibility for the
management of a program is left to local cities and counties. Highways shown as "eligible" for
listing are believed to have outstanding scenic values. Once a highway is shown in "Streets and
Highways Code Section 263", it may be nominated for official designation by the local governing
body with jurisdiction over the lands adjacent to the proposed scenic highway. A visual
assessment is required and a number of other steps must be followed. No highways in the vicinity
of the project site are included in "Streets and Highways Code Section 263" or are designated a
scenic highway.

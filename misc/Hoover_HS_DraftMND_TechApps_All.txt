INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS

Existing Site Characterization

         The San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) Hoover High School campus site
consists of approximately 25.46 acres located north and east of El Cajon Boulevard and
Highland Avenue in the City of San Diego, California, as shown in Figure 1 starting on
the following page. Regional access to the site is obtained via Interstate 15 (I-15) and/or
El Cajon Boulevard, via Fairmont or Highland Avenue(s).

        The Hoover High School campus site is currently fully built out with numerous
classroom structures and ancillary support facilities, as can be seen in Figure 2 on Page
3 of this report. Onsite elevations across the site and surrounding area range between
360- and 365-feet above mean sea level (MSL), with a slope generally towards Highland
Avenue to the southwest.

Project Description

         The proposed project under examination within this acoustical site assessment
consists of upgrading athletic facilities on the Hoover High School campus and providing
Americans with Disability Act (ADA) compliant facilities. Some key components of the
project will include replacing existing football/track stadium bleachers, installing new
lighting for the football/track field, replacing the existing tennis courts with a new softball
field, renovating an existing baseball field, and providing additional parking. The project
is planned to be completed by late 2013. The proposed development plan can be seen
in Figure 3 on Page 4 of this report.

Acoustical Definitions

        Sound waves are linear mechanical waves. They can be propagated in solids,
liquids, and gases. The material transmitting such a wave oscillates in the direction of
propagation of the wave itself. Sound waves originate from some sort of vibrating
surface. Whether this surface is the vibrating string of a violin or a person's vocal cords,
a vibrating column of air from an organ or clarinet, or a vibrating panel from a
loudspeaker, drum, or aircraft, the sound waves generated are all similar. All of these
vibrating elements alternatively compress the surrounding air on a forward movement
and expand it on a backward movement.

        There is a large range of frequencies within which linear waves can be
generated, sound waves being confined to the frequency range that can stimulate the
auditory organs to the sensation of hearing. For humans this range is from about 20
Hertz (Hz or cycles per second) to about 20,000 Hz. The air transmits these frequency
disturbances outward from the source of the wave. Sound waves, if unimpeded, will
spread out in all directions from a source. Upon entering the auditory organs, these
waves produce the sensation of sound. Waveforms that are approximately periodic, or
consist of a small number of periodic components, can give rise to a pleasant sensation
(assuming the intensity is not too high), for example, as in a musical composition.

        Noise, on the other hand, can be represented as a superposition of periodic
waves with a large number of components, and is generally defined as unwanted or
annoying sound that is typically associated with human activity and which interferes with
or disrupts normal activities. Although exposure to high noise levels has been
demonstrated to cause hearing loss, the principal human response to environmental
noise is annoyance. The response of individuals to similar noise events is diverse and
influenced by the type of noise, the perceived importance of the noise and its
appropriateness in the setting, the time of day, and the sensitivity of the individual
hearing the sound.

        Airborne sound is a rapid fluctuation of air pressure above and below
atmospheric levels. The loudest sounds that the human ear can hear comfortably are
approximately one trillion (or 1x1012) times the acoustic energy that the ear can barely
detect. Because of this vast range, any attempt to represent the acoustic intensity of a
particular sound on a linear scale becomes unwieldy. As a result, a logarithmic ratio,
originally conceived for radio work, known as the decibel (dB) is commonly employed.1

        A sound level of zero "0" dB is scaled such that it is defined as the threshold of
human hearing, and would be barely audible to a human of normal hearing under
extremely quiet listening conditions. Such conditions can only be generated in anechoic
or "dead rooms". Typically, the quietest environmental conditions (extreme rural areas
with extensive shielding) yield sound levels of approximately 20 decibels. Normal speech
has a sound level of approximately 60 dB. Sound levels above 120 dB roughly
correspond to the threshold of pain.

        The minimum change in sound level that the human ear can detect is
approximately 3.0 dBA.2 A change in sound level of 10 dB is usually perceived by the
average person as a doubling (or halving) of the sounds loudness.3 A change in sound
level of 10 dB actually represents an approximate 90 percent change in the sound
intensity, but only about a 50 percent change in the perceived loudness. This is due to
the nonlinear response of the human ear to sound.

        As mentioned above, most of the sounds we hear in the environment do not
consist of a single frequency, but rather a broad band of frequencies differing in sound
level. The intensities of each frequency add to generate the sound we hear. The method
commonly used to quantify environmental sounds consists of determining all of the
frequencies of a sound according to a weighting system that reflects the nonlinear
response characteristics of the human ear. This is called "A" weighting, and the decibel
level measured is called the A-weighted sound level (or dBA). In practice, the level of a

  A unit used to express the relative magnitude of a sound wave. This level is defined as being equal to 20 times the common logarithm of
the ratio of the pressure produced by a sound wave of interest to a `reference' pressure wave equal to 20 micro Pascal's (µPa) measured at
a distance of 1 meter. 20 µPa is the smallest amount of pressure capable of producing the sensation of hearing in a human.

  Every 3 dB equates to a 50% of drop (or increase) in wave strength; therefore a 6 dB drop/increase = a loss/increase of 75% of total
signal strength and so on.

    This is a subjective reference based upon the nonlinear nature of the human ear.

noise source is conveniently measured using a sound level meter that includes a filter
corresponding to the dBA curve.4

        Although the A-weighted sound level may adequately indicate the level of
environmental noise at any instant in time, community noise levels vary continuously.
Most environmental noise includes a conglomeration of sounds from distant sources that
create a relatively steady background noise in which no particular source is identifiable.
For this type of noise, a single descriptor called the Leq (or equivalent sound level) is
used. Leq is the energy-mean A-weighted sound level during a measured time interval,
and would be defined mathematically by the following continuous integral below,

                                                             "1 T             %
                                              Leq = 10 Log10 $ ! SPL (t )2 dt '
                                                             #T 0             &
where,
           Leq is the energy equivalent sound level,
           t is the independent variable of time,
           T is the total time interval of the event,
           and, SPL is the sound pressure level re. 20 µPa.

         Thus, Leq is the `equivalent' constant sound level that would have to be produced
by a given source to equal the average of the fluctuating level measured. For most
acoustical studies, the study interval is generally taken as one-hour and is abbreviated
Leq-h or Leq(h); however, other time intervals are utilized depending on the jurisdictional
preference. For a series of discrete sound sources, the above expression would reduce
to its Riemann equivalent as,

                                                           #1 n               &
                                            Leq = 10 Log10 % " SPL (ti )2 !ti (
                                                           $ T i =1           '

        Another similar acoustical descriptor known as the Single Event Level (or SEL) is
useful in describing sounds that are of a short duration (such as impulsive sounds), or of
a highly fluctuating nature. A simple relationship between Leq and SEL can be developed

  In some cases, it is important to measure the distribution of sound pressure as a function of frequency. Under these circumstances, the
incoming sound wave is passed through a series of band pass filters having predefined frequencies where they are resonant. The relative
response of each filter (in dB, dBA, etc.) directly corresponds to the amount of sound energy present at that particular frequency. In
standard acoustics two unique filter sets are used to accomplish this task, namely the 1/1 octave band and 1/3 octave band set. An octave
is defined as the interval between any two frequencies having a ratio of 2 to 1.

By definition, a whole octave filter (1/1) is a band-pass filter having a bandwidth equal to 70.7-percent of its center frequency (i.e., the
frequency of interest) distributed across 11 bands between 11 Hz and 22,700 Hz (the effective audio frequency range). A 1/3 Octave Band
filter has a bandwidth equal to 23.1% of its center frequency, distributed across 32 bands between 14.1 Hz and 22,390 Hz. Thus, the
octave band frequencies would be 16, 31.5, 63, 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 and 16000 Hz. The corresponding 1/3 octave band
frequencies would be 16, 20, 25, 31.5, 40, 50, 63, 80, 100, 125, 160, 200, 250, 315, 400, 500, 630, 800, 1000, 1250, 1600, 2000, 2500,
3150, 4000, 5000, 6300, 8000, 10000, 12500, 16000 and 20000 Hz.

where,
           SELi is the Single Event Level at time interval `i'
           T is the time interval of the event,
           T0 is a reference time duration (typically one second)
           n is the number of time intervals

For the calculation of Leq(h) the above equation reduces to,

        To describe the time-varying character of environmental noise, the statistical
noise descriptors L10, L50, and L90 are commonly used. They are the noise levels equaled
or exceeded during 10 percent, 50 percent, and 90 percent of a stated time. Sound
levels associated with the L10 typically describe transient or short-term events, while
levels associated with the L90 describe the steady state (or most prevalent) noise
conditions. The L50 level is the arithmetic average of the measured sound interval. In
addition, it is often desirable to know the acoustic range of the noise source being
measured. This is accomplished through the maximum and minimum measured sound
level (Lmax and Lmin) indicators. The Lmin value obtained for a particular monitoring
location is often called the acoustic floor for that location.

        Finally, the aggregate of all community noise events are typically averaged into a
single value known as the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). This descriptor is
calculated by averaging all events over a specified time interval and applying a 5-dBA
penalty to any sounds occurring between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. and a 10-decibel
penalty to sounds that occur during nighttime hours (i.e., 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.). This penalty
is applied to compensate for the increased sensitivity to noise during the quieter
nighttime hours. Mathematically, CNEL can be derived based upon the hourly Leq values
via the following expression,

                                  1 n !                                                                  $

  SEL is defined as that constant sound level that has the same amount of energy in one second as the original noise event. Thus, SEL is
similar to Leq, in that the total sound energy is integrated over the measurement period; but instead of averaging it over the entire
measurement period (as is done with Leq), a reference duration of one-second is used.

SIGNIFICANCE THRESHOLDS

California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Thresholds

       Section 15382 of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines
defines a significant impact as,

    "... a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions
    within the area affected by the project including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna,
    ambient noise, and objects of historic or aesthetic significance."

        The minimum change in sound level that the human ear can detect is
approximately 3-dBA. This increment, 3-dBA, is commonly accepted under CEQA as
representing the point where a noise level increase would represent a significant impact.
This impact threshold is accepted by the City of San Diego and will be used as the
significance threshold to determine the project's impact on the affected (existing)
environment.

           "(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, between the hours of 7:00 p.m. of any day and 7:00 a.m. of
           the following day, or on legal holidays as specified in section 21.04 of the San Diego Municipal
           Code, with the exception of Columbus Day and Washington's Birthday, or on Sundays, to erect,
           construct, demolish, excavate for, alter or repair any building or structure in such a manner as to

           (b) Except as provided in Subsection C hereof, it shall be unlawful for any person, including the City
           of San Diego, to conduct any construction activity so as to cause, at or beyond the property lines of
           any property zoned residential, an average sound level greater than 75 decibels {dBA} during the
           12-hour period from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m."

       Thus, the maximum allowable noise threshold applicable to the proposed project
would be 75 dBA Leq(12h) between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Nighttime
construction would require a variance to Section 59.5.0404 per the discretion of the
Director of Public Works and is not anticipated as part of this project.

City of San Diego Operational Noise Standards

       Property line noise thresholds are established in the City of San Diego Noise
Ordinance, Section 59.5.0401. The relevant limits are shown below in Table 1. The
applicable requirement is a function of the time-of-day and land use zone. Sound levels
are measured at the boundary of the property containing the noise source. For the
purposes of this project, the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) utilizes these
standards as CEQA guidance thresholds.

        Surrounding land use zones are RS-1-7, RM-1-1, CUPD CT-2-4, CUPD CU-2-3,
CUPD CU-2-4, and RM-1-2, as can be seen in Figure 4 on the following page. The
property line standard for cases where the zoning differs between land uses is to utilize
the arithmetic mean of the two standards.

         The property line standard would be 50 dBA Leq(h) between the hours of 7 a.m.
and 7 p.m., 45 dBA between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., and 40 dBA
between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Evening events at the school site are not
expected to extend beyond 10:00 p.m. Given this, the applicable worst-case property
line standards for onsite activities would be 50 dBA Leq(h) during the day and 45 dBA
Leq(h) during the night.

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

Existing Conditions / Baseline Calibration Survey

        Two residential monitoring locations within areas anticipated to have the greatest
noise impact potential from sporting events was selected for the purposes of determining
the ambient evening baseline site conditions. The positions, which are denoted as
Monitoring Locations ML 1 and ML 2 are shown in Figure 5 below (as indicated by the
spot labels). ML 1 was sampled on 5/7/09 at 9:00 p.m. ML 2 was sampled on 8/24/09 at
7:00 p.m. and served as a redundant check on the field work. All monitoring was
performed during normal community acoustical conditions indicative of an evening
residential environment.

        For the field monitoring effort, a Quest SoundPro SP-DL-2 ANSI Type 2
integrating sound level meter was used for data collection. The meter was affixed to a
tripod five-feet above ground level, in order to simulate the noise exposure of an
average-height human being. Prior to testing, all equipment was calibrated at ISE's
acoustics and vibration laboratory to verify conformance with ANSI S1-4 1983 Type 2
and IEC 651 Type 2 standards.6

Construction Noise Impact Assessment Approach

       Major construction noise emission generators would consist primarily of activities
associated with demolition of the existing bleacher areas, concrete deliveries, remedial
grading activities for parking lot activities, pavers, and contractor vehicles.

        Construction noise present at the project site was based upon past measured
levels and sources from EPA PB 206717 of each expected equipment type, the duty
cycle of each of the equipment components, and the expected average noise level (over
a given workday), as well as the expected worst-case noise level at the nearest sensitive
receptor.7 Cumulative (i.e., worst case aggregate) levels were calculated for a range of
expected worst-case noise emissions from proposed equipment at the closest sensitive
receptors, per the requirements of Section 59.5.0404 of the City's Construction
Ordinance.

Future Onsite Noise Modeling Approach

        Dominant proposed onsite noise sources, consisting of worst-case participant
and spectator vocalizations, and associated public address systems, were modeled
using the ISE Industrial Source Model (IS3) v4.0 for a full occupancy event consisting of
the worst-case scenario of all fields being active simultaneously.8 The IS3 model
calculates the predicted acoustic field pattern using a vector-based summation of all
source-receptor pairs. The resulting output consists of an isogram containing the
predicted acoustic field, accounting for refraction and structural attenuation.

       The modeled geometric definition points as well as anticipated noise source
areas are shown graphically in Figure 6 on the following page. Brown shaded polygons
and lines indicate intervening structures and topography of acoustical interest. Orange
dots indicate the proposed PA speaker system to be utilized during game play with a
representative source level of 90 dBA Leq(h) at three-feet. The specifications for this
system are provided as an attachment to this report. Human vocalization was modeled
as a series of discrete sound emitters representative of the equivalent hourly vocal effort
of a group of 50 screaming people under normal outdoor conditions (as shown by the
red dots within the bleacher areas of each field).9

 The ISE Industrial Source Model (IS ) v4.0 provides a visual representation of an acoustic field pattern across any three-dimensional
surface, factoring in the effects of topographic and structural interference, apparent receptor elevation, static reflection from objects,
multiple material attenuative sources, variable propagation rates and source types, and atmospheric scattering.

  Levels assumed for human vocalization during a maximum capacity game are based upon aggregate hourly noise emission levels within
each of the stadium sections. These hourly average levels would accommodate both general communication within the crowd (i.e., smaller
indiscernible vocalizations) as well as intermittent crowd cheering and applause.

Numerical values are based upon previous observations and measurements performed by ISE of similar events over the past decade. The
findings indicate that a given group of 50 individuals produce an hourly equivalent noise level of approximately 50 to 55 dBA at 50 feet
under free-field conditions with no reflection, and soft ground conditions (normal conversation is between 45 to 50 dBA at three feet). For
computational purposes, this source can be represented as having an equivalent sound level of 75 dBA at three-feet (in order to be
consistent with other acoustical levels shown in this report). For each group of 50 individuals present, it follows that the ambient noise level
would increase by three decibels. It can be easily seen that for a full sporting event (such as a full capacity football event) source levels can
exceed 90 dBA due to human vocalization alone.

       Predicted levels were examined for consistency with the applicable property line
standards identified previously in Table 1 (i.e. 45 dBA Leq(h)). Sources found to exceed
the applicable standards would be further examined for appropriate mitigation measures.

Traffic Segment Impact Assessment Approach

        The ISE RoadNoise v2.4 traffic noise prediction model, which is based upon
Caltrans Sound 32 Traffic Noise Prediction Model with California (CALVENO) noise
emission factors (based on FHWA RD-77-108 and FHWA/CA/TL-87/03 standards), was
used to calculate the increase in vehicular traffic noise levels along major servicing
roadways due to the proposed development project plan.10 The model assumed a `hard-
site' propagation rule (i.e., 3.0 dBA loss per doubling of distance (DD) between source
and receiver) and a normalized 45 MPH travel speed across all segments, thereby
yielding a representative worst-case noise contour set.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Ambient Sound Measurement Results

       Testing was performed under combined evening/nighttime conditions with little or
no appreciable wind, an approximate mean temperatures ranging between 63 to 76
degrees Fahrenheit. The results of the sound level monitoring are shown below in Table
2. The values for the equivalent sound level (Leq(h)), the maximum and minimum
measured sound levels (Lmax and Lmin), and the statistical indicators L10, L50, and L90,

        Measurements collected offsite reflect the ambient sound levels at the boundary
of the project site. As shown above, the hourly average sound level (or Leq(h)) recorded
over the monitoring period ranged between approximately 58 to 60 dBA. The acoustic
floor for the site as seen by the Lmin indicator, was found to range between 48 and 51
dBA and would be representative of quiet evening community noise levels within the
project study area. The dominant observed noise source was found to be an aggregate
of surface street traffic noise, surrounding community noise, and activity within the
campus site.

Construction Noise Emission Levels

        The estimated construction equipment noise emissions are provided in Table 3,
below, for the anticipated demolition and grading operations (i.e., bleacher demolition
and support construction, old pavement demolition and clearing, debris hauling to
dumpster(s), parking lot leveling, and driveway and lot surfacing). This would typically
consist of two distinct phases. Construction of the actual bleachers and support
structures would utilize smaller contingencies of equipment and would not be as
significant as the two primary phases analyzed below.

         Construction within the proposed project area would typically occur between the
hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday in accordance with City operational
requirements. The nearest sensitive receptor with the respect to the closest construction
activities would be approximately 100-feet distant on average. Noise levels under this
condition would be as high as 69.8 dBA Leq(12h) assuming all activities occurred in a
single condensed area (a highly unlikely, but worst-case condition). As such,
construction noise impacts are not expected and would not require mitigation.

Expected Operational Noise Impacts

        The results of the IS3 computer modeling are provided in Figure 7 on the
following page for estimated worst-case event noise levels. The colored contours
represent areas of equal noise exposure within the project site and surrounding
properties and are a composite of the approximate 450,000 data points generated by the
computer model. This model included the effects of existing and proposed structures,
and the proposed wall along the northern property line adjacent to the renovated
bleachers. The IS3 model input and output results are provided as an attachment to this
report.

        Dominant source levels within the bleacher area perimeter would consist of
spectator vocalizations during the game and intermittent public address system
announcements. These levels were modeled at a constant value of at 75 dBA Leq(h) at
3.0-feet per group of 50 screaming people, and 90 dBA per public address speaker.
These levels are consistent with the proposed utilization of the site, as well as past
observations by ISE. Further, it was assumed that all play areas would be operating
simultaneously (a worst-case operational assessment).

        Based upon these findings, full utilization of the project site inclusive of the
football stadium and baseball/softball fields was found to produce worst-case residential
property line sound levels of approximately 45 to 50 dBA Leq(h) along all property lines
with the exception of areas to the south towards El Cajon Boulevard.11 Levels within
these areas (southerly areas) are expected to comply with the intent of the City's Noise
Ordinance, and no offsite impacts would be indicated within any adjacent residential use
space during daytime play hours (which would be consistent with non-play community
noise levels as previously shown in Table 2 above).

         It should be noted that two areas are indicated where noise exposure contour
extends onto adjoining properties (refer to Figure 8 on Page 18 of this report) due to full
utilization of all athletic fields within the project site. The estimated exceedance in this
case is approximately 3.0-dBA above the daytime 50-dBA Leq(h) standard and 8.0-dBA
above the nighttime standard as measured at the residential property line. Daytime
operation is not expected to create a noise nuisance under San Diego City code as the
projected level is well below the current ambient levels as previously shown in Table 2
above.

       It is therefore recommended that the proposed PA system be directional in
nature (i.e., the ability to direct the majority of its sound away from the property line
shown in Figure 8), or, have the ability to be adjusted a minimum of -10.0 dB during
evening hours to preclude the presence of any noise impacts to offsite sensitive receptor
areas during these quieter hours. It is recommended that the PA system be a
multichannel system with the ability to adjust each PA speaker horn independently to
meet applicable property line standards. Given this design measure, no acoustical
(nuisance noise) impacts would be indicated during evening hours.

CONCLUSIONS

       Construction noise levels associated with implementation of the proposed
upgrade plan would be as high as 69.8 dBA Leq(12h) assuming all activities occurred in a
single condensed area (a highly unlikely, but worst-case condition). As such,
construction noise impacts are not expected and would not require mitigation.

        Onsite noise modeling of proposed athletic events under a full utilization of the
project site inclusive of the football stadium and baseball/softball fields was found to
produce worst-case residential property line sound levels of between 45 to 50 dBA Leq(h)
along all property lines with the exception of areas to the south towards El Cajon
Boulevard. The estimated exceedance is approximately 3.0-dBA above the daytime
standard and 8.0-dBA above the nighttime standard as measured at the residential
property line.

        Daytime operation is not expected to create a noise nuisance under San Diego
City code as the projected level is well below the current ambient levels. It is
recommended for nighttime operation that the proposed PA system be directional in
nature, or, have the ability to be adjusted a minimum of -10.0 dB during evening hours to
preclude the presence of any noise impacts to offsite sensitive receptor areas during
these quieter hours. Further, it is recommended that the PA system be a multichannel
system with the ability to adjust each PA speaker horn independently to meet applicable
property line standards. Given this mitigation, no residual impacts are anticipated as a
result of the project.

       Finally, all traffic segment noise level increases would be 0.1 dBA CNEL or less
due to proposed facility operation; therefore, no project related traffic noise impacts are
expected.

Executive Summary
Herbert Hoover High School ­ Athletic Facilities Upgrades
Draft Traffic Impact Study

This traffic impact study is being prepared at the request of BRG Consulting, Inc. and the San Diego
Unified School District (District) and will ultimately be incorporated into the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) document prepared for the project. The District is considered
the CEQA lead agency for the project.

This report analyses the potential parking and traffic impacts of proposed upgrades to the athletic
facilities at Herbert Hoover High School. The Hoover High School campus is located north and
east of El Cajon Boulevard and Highland Avenue in the City of San Diego, California. The project
is planned to be completed by summer 2010.


PARKING

As part of the project, additional parking will be added to Herbert Hoover High School, ultimately
providing 223 parking spaces. Parking requirements will vary for the different athletic events;
however, the highest demand is anticipated during an evening football game. An average evening
football game is calculated to require 397 parking spaces. A shortage of 174 parking spaces is
calculated when the ultimate parking supply of 223 is subtracted from the evening football game
parking requirement of 397 spaces. The traffic and crowd control measures currently in place for
events at the school will be implemented for these additional evening events made possible by
the installation of stadium lighting, as determined necessary by school officials.

Although a parking deficit will remain even with implementation of the proposed project, a less
than significant impact related to parking is identified based on the following reasons:

       1) The proposed project will increase the number of parking spaces on the campus by 56
          spaces;

       2) Small number of evening athletic events (15 per year); and,

       3) Non-compliance with the City's parking ordinance does not necessarily constitute a
          significant environmental impact. The City's parking threshold of significance states
          that "Generally, if a project is deficient by more than ten percent of the required amount
          of parking (which the project is, as it relates to football game attendance) and at least
          one of the following criteria applies, then a significant impact may result:"

               Threshold: The project's parking shortfall or displacement of existing parking
               would substantially affect the availability of parking in an adjacent residential area,
               including the availability of public parking - Based upon the analysis above,


         LOS Engineering, Inc.           Hoover High School ­ Athletic Facilities Upgrades Draft TIS
        Traffic and Transportation                  iv                                  June 3, 2010
               including the low frequency of the evening athletic events (15 per year),
               implementation of the proposed project would not frequently affect the availability
               of parking in an adjacent residential area.

               Threshold: The parking deficiency would severely impede the accessibility of a
               public facility, such as a park or beach ­ The parking deficiency would not
               impede accessibility to a public facility such as a park or beach. In fact, the
               availability of street parking in the nearby residential area would enable members
               of the public that cannot park on the campus to park in close proximity to the
               football field so they can attend the game.

Neither of the two criteria identified above in the City's parking significance determination
threshold apply to the proposed project. Therefore, the proposed project will result in a less than
significant impact to parking.


TRAFFIC

Project trip generation is typically calculated using trip rates from the City of San Diego Trip
Generation Manual, May 2003; however, the aforementioned manual does not include trip rates for
the various proposed uses of the upgraded athletic facilities. The highest anticipated use of the
athletic facilities is a football game. While football games currently take place at the existing
athletic field, they occur in the afternoon during daylight hours. With the addition of new lighting,
football games are planned for around 6:30 PM.

The project study area is generally determined by the limits or extent of where 50 peak hour
project trips would travel to or from the site, which is based on Congestion Management
Program (CMP) guidelines. For this project, six intersections and three segments around the
project site were analyzed. City of San Diego engineering staff provided a list of two cumulative
projects near Herbert Hoover High School. Three scenarios were also analyzed, which included
Existing, Near-term without Project Conditions, and Near-term with Project Conditions.

No direct impacts were calculated by the anticipated project traffic; however, it is recommended
that the applicant provide flag/security personnel to prevent patrons from circulating in nearby
local neighborhoods and on the adjacent streets.

1.0     Introduction
This report analyses the potential parking and traffic impacts of proposed upgrades to the athletic
facilities at Herbert Hoover High School. The changes will occur at various locations throughout
the campus. The main football facility is located on the northern portion of the campus, just south
of Monroe Avenue. The Hoover High School campus is located north and east of El Cajon
Boulevard and Highland Avenue in the City of San Diego, California. The project is planned to be
completed by summer 2010. The location of the project is shown in Figure 1. A site plan is shown
in Figure 2.

The purpose of this study is to analyze how the proposed project will affect parking and traffic on
and around the Herbert Hoover High School campus during an evening event at the athletic
facilities. Additionally, this report describes the existing roadway network in the vicinity of the
project site and includes a review of the existing and proposed activities for weekday post PM peak
hour, and daily traffic conditions when the project is completed. The report includes the following
chapters:

2.0      Project Description
The purpose of the project is to upgrade the existing athletic facilities on the school campus. In
addition, the proposed project would include the installation of additional parking spaces, stadium
lighting, and provide Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant facilities. Details of the
upgrade include:

Football/Track Field:
   · Replace existing home side bleachers;
   · Replace existing visitor side bleachers and install concrete masonry screen wall at bleachers
       and ramps;
   · Replace the existing press box with 14 workstations and elevator for wheelchair access;
   · Construct a new 3,436 square foot athletic services building with new "Breitbard Stadium"
       sign;
   · Install new lighting for the football field (two 100 foot light standards on south side of
       football field and two 90 foot light standards on north side of football field). The field
       lighting would be focused and directed at the field area during school events, including
       sporting events (i.e., football, soccer, track), that occur after dusk. It is anticipated that field
       lighting will be dimmed at the conclusion of the event and after all patrons have safely
       exited the facility (estimated at 9pm). Subsequently, the facility would be cleaned and the
       field lights will be extinguished (estimated at 10pm);
   · Install a new ornamental steel perimeter fence surrounding the football field;
   · Install stand-up snack tables;
   · Construct concrete base and placque "Arnold Margulis Memorial Track"; and,
   · Construct a concrete masonry wall (268 feet long, 11 feet high, with 12-foot return at each
       end) on the northern side of visitor bleachers (parallel to Monroe Avenue), which will serve
       to visually screen the bleachers from the surrounding neighborhood.

    Note:      Access to the football filed would only be available from the internal portion of the
       school campus through the eastern portion of the football field at the new athletic services
       building.

Softball Field:
    · Replace the existing tennis courts with a new softball field;
    · Construct a new softball scoreboard;
    · Construct new accessible dugouts;
    · Construct new softball batting cages; and,
    · Install a new chain link perimeter fence.

Baseball Field:
   · Existing bleachers (162 seats) would be replaced to accommodate 356 seats including four
       wheelchair spaces;
   · Replace existing dugouts with new accessible dugouts;
   · Construct a new 15-foot wall with sign for "Ted Williams Field";
   · Install serpentine seating wall;
   · Construct a new baseball scoreboard;

   ·   Construct a new maintenance equipment storage building; and,
   ·   Install a new chain link perimeter fence.

Overall School Campus:
   · Repair existing city-owned sidewalks that surround the school for ADA compliance; and,
   · Install new landscaping.

Existing and Proposed Parking
    The Herbert Hoover High School campus currently has a total of 167 parking spaces. As a
    result of the proposed project, the number of parking spaces on the campus will increase by 56
    to 223.
          Lot A (total spaces ­ 87):
                o Existing - 51 spaces
                o Proposed ­ 36 spaces, this lot is proposed as part of the project to be
                    reconfigured to maximize the number of spaces and circulation.
          Lot B (total spaces ­ 14):
                o Existing- 14 spaces. No changes proposed.
          Lot C (total spaces ­ 71):
                o Existing - 71
          Lot D (total spaces ­ 41)
                o Existing - 31
                o Proposed - 10 spaces added to maximize the number of spaces and circulation.
          Maintenance Storage Building ­ 10 new spaces proposed.

Athletic Field Events Schedule
New school athletic events are not anticipated as part of the project; however, existing events
conducted on the football field that were possible only during daylight hours or with temporary
lights could now occur in the evening. These existing events include football, boys and girls soccer,
and track and field. The District anticipates that approximately 15 evening events would occur at
the school with the implementation of the proposed project. The traffic and crowd control measures
currently in place for events at the school will be implemented for these additional evening events
made possible by the installation of stadium lighting, as determined necessary by school officials.
The District notes that due to routine practices and the potential for unforeseen events, such as
playoff games, a few more events may occur. No lights are proposed on the upgraded baseball field
or on the new softball field; therefore, only daytime baseball or softball games would occur.

The highest anticipated attendance will be evening football games. The football games are planned
to begin at approximately 6:30 PM and end by 10:00 PM. Therefore, the parking and traffic
analysis will be based on an average evening football game. Since the analysis is based on the
highest anticipated traffic and parking generator, no other events were analyzed as they would
generate less traffic and parking demands.

Construction Schedule
Construction of the proposed project would include demolition and grading operations (i.e.,
bleacher demolition and support construction, pavement demolition and clearing, debris hauling to
dumpster(s), parking lot leveling, and driveway and lot surfacing). Construction of the proposed
project would occur between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, in accordance
with City of San Diego operational requirements for construction.

3.0     Parking Analysis
This section describes the existing and proposed parking conditions on the Herbert Hoover High
School campus and the anticipated parking needs for an evening football game. On-street parking
around the High School is also discussed.

3.1 Existing Parking Conditions

The Herbert Hoover High School campus currently has a total of 167 parking spaces. The main lot
in front of the school has 51 spaces and is identified as Lot "A" on the site plan (Figure 2). Lot "B"
is adjacent to Building 400 with 14 spaces. Lot "C" has 71 spaces and Lot "D" has 31 spaces. The
on-site parking count was provided by School District staff as documented in Appendix A.

The streets surrounding the High School provide on-street public parking available to the public.
On-street parking restrictions such as day or time were not observed. Given the open availability of
these spaces, the number of on-street spaces currently used by the high school patrons is unknown.
While on-street public parking supply is assumed as a source for future event parking, it is
anticipated that high school patrons would continue to use the public parking in a similar manner as
the present.

3.2 Parking Significance Criteria

The City of San Diego CEQA Significance Determination Threshold (January 2007) for parking
states:

      "Non-compliance with the City's parking ordinance does not necessarily constitute a
      significant environmental impact. However, it can lead to a decrease in the availability of
      existing public parking in the vicinity of the project. Generally, if a project is deficient by
      more than ten percent of the required amount of parking and at least one of the following
      criteria applies, then a significant impact may result:

           1. The project's parking shortfall or displacement of existing parking would
              substantially affect the availability of parking in an adjacent residential area,
              including the availability of public parking.

           2. The parking deficiency would severely impede the accessibility of a public
              facility, such as a park or beach."

Please note that this threshold of significance is primarily utilized for, and is most applicable to,
"new" development projects.          In this situation, Herbert Hoover High School is an
existing/operating high school campus in a densely urbanized portion of the City of San Diego.
Meeting the City's parking requirements is not a project goal or objective due to the limited land
area available; however, parking the greatest number of cars of high school students/patrons to
the maximum extent possible is a recognized focus of SDUSD.

3.3 Proposed Parking Conditions

As part of the project, a total of 56 additional on-site parking spaces will be constructed for a new
on-site parking count of 223 spaces. Lot "A" will increase to 87 spaces. Lot "B" and "C" will
remain unchanged at 14 and 71 spaces, respectively. Lot "D" will increase to 41 spaces, and 10
new spaces will be provided by the maintenance storage building as shown previously on Figure 2.

The additional on-site parking spaces will off-set the need for high school students/patrons to utilize
on-street public parking during non-event conditions; although it is anticipated that during an event,
such as an evening football game, some of the on-street parking may be used as is the current
situation.


3.4 Anticipated Football Game Parking Demand

The anticipated parking demand for an average evening football game was determined by
calculating the:
        1) Number of spectators that would attend a football game;
        2) Percentage of football game attendees driving vs. walking; and,
        3) Vehicle occupancy for spectators.

3.4.1   Number of Football Game Spectators

Based on football game attendance data provided by La Jolla, Lincoln, Madison, Mira Mesa and
San Diego High School staff, as well as student body numbers obtained from the Academic Year
2007-08 School Accountability Report Card (issued Spring 2009) and on-line source for Lincoln
High School, an average percentage of football game attendees vs. student body population of 68%
was calculated as shown below in Table 1.

To confirm the rationale for determining the number of football game spectators, the 68% student
body attendance factor was compared to the factor in the Byrd High School Reconfiguration Final
EIR (Los Angeles Unified School District). Byrd High School is in an urban setting such as Hoover
High School. In the Byrd FEIR, a 1,620-student high school would generate 1,000 attendees at a
football game. This percentage of football game attendees vs. student body population is
approximately 62%. Excerpts from the Byrd High School Reconfiguration Final EIR and local
football attendance data are included in Appendix B.

On average, 1,444 people are calculated to attend a football game based on multiplying the Hoover
High School student enrollment number of 2,123 (from the School Accountability Report Card) by
68% (2,123 x 0.68 = 1,444). The locally calculated 68% student body attendance factor is more
conservative than the 62% attendance factor documented in the Byrd High School Reconfiguration
Final EIR.

3.4.2   Percentage of Attendees Driving Vs. Walking

The home attendees are estimated at 70% of the stadium capacity (2,796 seats), while the visitor
attendees are estimated at 30% (1,174 seats) based on the bleacher seating arrangement.

Of the home attendees, those living within a half-mile of the school are assumed to walk (based on
the knowledge that limited on-site parking is available). The area of this radius is estimated to be
approximately 25% of the Hoover High School Attendance area based on attendance boundary
maps. Therefore, approximately 17.5% (70% x 25% = 17.5%) would walk to a game and
approximately 52.5% (70% x 75% = 52.5%) would drive.

All visitor attendees are assumed to drive. Therefore, the total percentage of all attendees
anticipated to drive to a game is 82.5% (52.5% of home attendees and the 30% visitor attendees).
The remaining 17.5% are estimated to walk.


3.4.3   Vehicle Occupancy for Spectators

Based on an average Hoover High School football game attendance of 1,444 people with 82.5% of
attendees driving, 1,191 trips would be generated. Using an average vehicle occupancy from the
Byrd High School Reconfiguration Final EIR of 3 persons/vehicle, the number of inbound and
outbound vehicles trips is 397 (1,191 people / 3 people per car).


3.4.4   Number of Anticipated Athletic Events

The District anticipates approximately 15 athletic events a year to occur at Hoover High School
during evening hours.


3.5 Parking Conclusion

As a result of implementing the proposed project, there would be an increase of 56 parking spaces
on the campus as compared to the existing parking condition. The proposed project includes new
football field lighting making it possible for evening football games to be played. For an average
evening football game, the anticipated attendance is 1,444 people arriving in 397 vehicles. Each
evening football games would require 397 parking spaces.

Similar to the current parking conditions during afternoon football games, it is anticipated that a
parking shortage (174 parking spaces) may occur during evening football games. Based on the

         LOS Engineering, Inc.           Hoover High School ­ Athletic Facilities Upgrades Draft TIS
         Traffic and Transportation                 8                                   June 3, 2010
additional parking spaces proposed on the campus as part of this project, it is anticipated that fewer
cars would park off-site during evening football games, as compared to the existing parking
condition during afternoon football games with a similar patron attendance. The traffic and crowd
control measures currently in place for events at the school will be implemented for these additional
evening events made possible by the installation of stadium lighting, as determined necessary by
school officials.

Although a parking deficit would remain even with implementation of the proposed project, a less
than significant impact related to parking is identified based on the following reasons:

       1) The proposed project will increase the number of parking spaces on the campus by 56
          spaces;

       2) Small number of evening athletic events; and,

       3) Per the City's own CEQA Significance Determination Threshold, non-compliance with
          the City's parking ordinance does not necessarily constitute a significant environmental
          impact. The City's parking threshold states that "Generally, if a project is deficient by
          more than ten percent of the required amount of parking (which the project is, as it
          relates to football game attendance) and at least one of the following criteria applies,
          then a significant impact may result:"

               Threshold: The project's parking shortfall or displacement of existing parking
               would substantially affect the availability of parking in an adjacent residential area,
               including the availability of public parking - Based upon the analysis above,
               including the low frequency of the evening athletic events (15 per year),
               implementation of the proposed project would not frequently affect the availability
               of parking in an adjacent residential area.

               Threshold: The parking deficiency would severely impede the accessibility of a
               public facility, such as a park or beach ­ The parking deficiency would not
               impede accessibility to a public facility such as a park or beach. In fact, the
               availability of street parking in the nearby residential area would enable members
               of the public that cannot park on the campus to park in close proximity to the
               football field to attend the game.

The proposed project does not substantially conflict with the City's parking determination
threshold; therefore, the proposed project will result in a less than significant impact to parking.

4.0     Traffic Analysis
The purpose of this traffic analysis is to determine and analyze potential traffic impacts for an
average evening football game at the Herbert Hoover High School. Typically, football games occur
on Fridays; therefore, the traffic data was collected on a Friday. Since the game is proposed to start
around 6:30 PM, the peak hour analysis is based on the hour before the game starts.

This section describes the existing roadway network in the vicinity of the project site and includes a
review of the existing and proposed activities for a 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM peak period and daily
traffic conditions when the project is completed. The format of this section includes the following
subchapters:

4.1      Study Methodology

The parameters by which this traffic study was prepared included the determination of what
intersections and roadways are to be analyzed, the scenarios to be analyzed and the methods
required for analysis. The criteria for each of these parameters are included herein.

4.1.1        Study Area Criteria

The project study area is generally determined by the limits or extent of where 50 peak hour
project trips would travel to or from the site, which is based on Congestion Management
Program (CMP) guidelines. For this project, the following intersections were included in this
study:

        1)   El Cajon Boulevard/I-15 SB Ramps (signalized)
        2)   El Cajon Boulevard /I-15 NB Ramps (signalized)
        3)   El Cajon Boulevard /43rd Street (signalized)
        4)   El Cajon Boulevard /Fairmount Avenue (signalized)
        5)   El Cajon Boulevard /Highland Ave North (un-signalized)
        6)   El Cajon Boulevard /Highland Ave South (signalized)

The following street segments were analyzed as part of this study:
    1) El Cajon Boulevard from I-15 to 43rd Street
    2) El Cajon Boulevard from 43rd Street to Fairmount Avenue
    3) El Cajon Boulevard from Highland Ave South to Euclid Avenue


4.1.2        Scenario Criteria

The number of scenarios to be analyzed is based on the City of San Diego Traffic Impact Study
Manual. Based on the forecasted number of project trips, the following study scenarios were
included:
      1) Existing Conditions
      2) Near-term without Project Conditions
      3) Near-term with Project Conditions


4.1.3        Traffic Analysis Criteria
The traffic analyses prepared for this study were based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM) operations analysis using Level of Service (LOS) evaluation criteria. The operating
conditions of the study intersections and street segments were measured using the HCM LOS
designations, which ranges from A through F. LOS A represents the best operating condition and
LOS F denotes the worst operating condition. For this traffic study, the intersections and street
segments were analyzed using the City of San Diego criteria. The LOS criteria for each roadway
component are described below.

4.1.3.1   Intersections
The study intersections were analyzed based on the operational analysis outlined in the 2000
HCM. This process defines LOS in terms of average control delay per vehicle, which is measured
in seconds. LOS at the intersections were calculated using the computer software program Synchro
6.0 (Trafficware Corporation, 2003). The HCM LOS for the range of delay by seconds for un-
signalized and signalized intersections is described in Table 2.

4.1.3.3   Arterial Segments
The arterial segments were analyzed based on the average travel speed outlined in the 2000 HCM.
This process defines LOS in terms of travel speed by street class identified by the range of free-flow
speeds as defined in the 2000 HCM. The arterial LOS by street class are summarized in Table 4.

4.1.4    Traffic Significance Criteria

A project is considered to have caused a significant impact if the new project traffic has
decreased the operations on the surrounding roadways by the City of San Diego defined
thresholds as shown in Table 5.

  deemed "significant." The project applicant shall identify "feasible mitigations" to achieve LOS D or better.       The acceptable Level of
  Service (LOS) standard for roadways and intersections in San Diego is LOS D. However, for undeveloped locations, the goal is to
                      3
  achieve a LOS C.        The impact is only considered significant if the total delay exceeds 15 minutes. Delay measured in seconds.
  V/C = Volume to Capacity Ratio (capacity at LOS E should be used). Speed = Arterial speed measured in miles per hour for CMP
  analyses.


If a significant impact is calculated due to the addition of project traffic, then feasible mitigation
is required to reduce the impact to LOS D. If the mitigation does not reduce the impact to LOS
D, the impact is considered significant and unmitigable.


4.1.5    Congestion Management Program Criteria

The Congestion Management Program (CMP), adopted in January 2003 by the SANDAG Board,
is intended to determine if a large project (greater than 2,400 ADT or more than 200 peak hour
trips) will adversely impact the CMP transportation system.

A CMP analysis is provided in the form of an arterial analysis along El Cajon Boulevard because
the project will add more than 200 peak hour trips during the PM peak commuter period.

4.2 Existing Conditions

This section describes the study area street system, PM peak hour intersection volumes, daily
roadway volumes, and existing LOS.


4.2.1   Existing Street System

In the vicinity of the project, the following roadway was analyzed as part of this study:

El Cajon Boulevard is classified as a 6-Lane Major from I-15 to Fairmount Avenue and as a 4-Lane
Major from Fairmount Avenue to Euclid Avenue in the Mid-City Community Plan (adopted by
City Council on August 4, 1998, excerpt included in Appendix C). El Cajon Boulevard from I-15
to 43rd Street is constructed with a raised median and three travel lanes in each direction. The
posted speed limit along this section is 35 Miles per Hour (MPH) and on-street parking is generally
allowed. From 43rd Street to Fairmount Avenue, El Cajon Boulevard is constructed with a raised
median and two through travel lanes in each direction (an additional eastbound lane exists that
becomes a right only trap lane to Fairmount Avenue). El Cajon Boulevard from Fairmount Avenue
to Euclid Avenue is generally constructed with a center Two Way Left Turn Lane (TWLTL) or left
turn pockets, two travel lanes in each direction and parking typically allowed on both side of the
roadway. The existing roadway conditions are shown in Figure 5.

4.3 Near-Term without Project Conditions

The near-term without project conditions describe the anticipated roadway operations during
opening day of the project anticipated to be 2010. This scenario includes surrounding cumulative
projects added to the existing traffic volumes.

City of San Diego engineering staff provided information on two cumulative projects in the
vicinity of the project. Cumulative project support information is included in Appendix F.
Details for the two cumulative projects include:

   1) Kensington Terrace ­ A mixed use project to be located on the northeast corner of
      Adams Avenue and Marlborough Drive. The cumulative trip generation was calculated
      at 1,413 ADT with 69 AM peak hour trips and 161 PM peak hour trips.

   2) Aldine Drive and Fairmount Avenue Slope Restoration ­ A slope restoration project that
      will not create new traffic but may restrict lane usage during construction. Currently the
      estimated project start is summer 2010 with a completion of early 2011.

The individual cumulative projects that will add traffic to the study area intersections and
segments are shown on Figure 5. Near-term traffic volumes (existing + cumulative) without the
project are shown on Figure 6. The LOS calculated under near-term conditions (existing +
cumulative) for the intersections, roadway segments, and arterial segments are shown in Tables
9, 10, and 11, respectively. Near-Term intersection calculations are included in Appendix G.

4.4 Project Traffic Elements

This section documents the project trip generation, distribution, assignment, driveway access,
and available nearby transit routes.


4.4.1   Project Trip Generation

Project trip generation is typically calculated using trip rates from the City of San Diego Trip
Generation Manual, May 2003; however, the aforementioned manual does not include trip rates for
the various proposed uses of the upgraded athletic facilities. The highest anticipated use of the
athletic facilities is a football game. While football games currently take place at the existing
athletic field, they occur in the afternoon during daylight hours. With the addition of new lighting,
football games are planned for 6:30 PM. A site specific trip generation was calculated based on the
parking demand previously described in Section 3 for an evening football game. Additionally, all of
the project trips are not entirely new ­ some of the trips are shifted from afternoon events to evening
events. The trip generation is summarized below.

Based on a data from five different high schools in San Diego County, football games have an
average attendance of 1,444 people with 82.5 percent of attendees driving. This results in 1,191
trips if each person drives alone. Using an average of 3 persons/vehicle, which is what is being used
for other schools (Byrd High School Reconfiguration Final EIR, Los Angeles Unified School
District, July 2007), the number of inbound trips is 397 (1,191 people/3 people per car) and 397
outbound trips. As such, an average football game at Hoover High School is calculated to generate
794 daily trips, with 397 PM peak hour trips (inbound) and 397 outbound trips around 9 PM.

The outbound project traffic is estimated to occur between 9:00 and 10:00 PM. The exact time will
vary because the duration of football games vary and people dispense at different intervals.
Background traffic between 9:00 and 10:00 PM is less than commuter peak hour traffic; therefore,
an outbound analysis was not conducted.


4.4.2   Project Distribution and Assignment

The project distribution is based on a blended average of the other high school geographic locations
(a school district map included in Appendix H). There will be some shifting of the visitor attendee
distribution based on the actual visiting school playing in the football game. The combined home
and visitor distribution should have on average approximately 39% arriving from the north (using I-
15, 43rd Street, and other streets), approximately 41% arriving from the south (using I-15,
Fairmount, Highland Ave, and other streets), approximately 9% arriving from the east along El
Cajon Boulevard, and approximately 11% arriving from the west along El Cajon Boulevard.
Because no one parking lot exists for all the attendees, various parking areas approaching the school
are anticipated to be used. This absorption of vehicles into various parking areas along with the
distribution is shown in Figure 7. The assignment for the inbound project traffic is shown in
Figure 8.

4.4.3   Project Proximity to Public Transit


Bus routes 1 and 15 serve El Cajon Boulevard and route 13 serves Fairmount Avenue and 43rd
Street (a short walk from Herbert Hoover High School). All three aforementioned routes provide
service until at least 11 PM, thus they could be used as an alternative transportation mode.
Copies of the bus route maps and schedules are included in Appendix I.

This scenario accounts for the addition of project traffic onto near-term (existing + cumulative)
conditions for post PM and ADT conditions. The intersection volumes and daily traffic volumes are
shown in Figure 9. LOS operations are shown in Tables 12, 13, and 14. Calculations are included
in Appendix J.

No direct impacts were calculated by the anticipated project traffic. An impact summary table is
included as Table 15.

As part of the project, additional parking will be added to Herbert Hoover High School, ultimately
providing 178 parking spaces. Parking requirements will vary for the different athletic events;
however, the highest demand is anticipated during an evening football game. An average evening
football game is calculated to require 397 parking spaces. A shortage of 174 parking spaces is
calculated when the ultimate parking supply of 223 is subtracted from an evening football game
parking requirement of 397 spaces. The traffic and crowd control measures currently in place for
events at the school will be implemented for these additional evening events made possible by
the installation of stadium lighting, as determined necessary by school officials.

Although a parking deficit will remain even with implementation of the proposed project, a less
than significant impact related to parking is identified based on the following reasons:

         1) The proposed project will increase the number of parking spaces on the campus by 56
            spaces;

         2) Small number of evening athletic events (15 per year); and,

         3) Non-compliance with the City's parking ordinance does not necessarily constitute a
            significant environmental impact. The City's parking threshold of significance states
            that "Generally, if a project is deficient by more than ten percent of the required amount
            of parking (which the project is, as it relates to football game attendance) and at least
            one of the following criteria applies, then a significant impact may result:"

                 Threshold: The project's parking shortfall or displacement of existing parking
                 would substantially affect the availability of parking in an adjacent residential area,
                 including the availability of public parking - Based upon the analysis above,
                 including the low frequency of the evening athletic events (15 per year),
                 implementation of the proposed project would not frequently affect the availability
                 of parking in an adjacent residential area.

                 Threshold: The parking deficiency would severely impede the accessibility of a
                 public facility, such as a park or beach ­ The parking deficiency would not

5.0 Conclusion and Recommendations
This report analyses the potential parking and traffic impacts of proposed upgrades to the athletic
facilities at Herbert Hoover High School. The Hoover High School campus is located north and
east of El Cajon Boulevard and Highland Avenue in the City of San Diego, California. The
project is planned to be completed by summer 2010.

Project trip generation is typically calculated using trip rates from the City of San Diego Trip
Generation Manual, May 2003; however, the aforementioned manual does not include trip rates for
the various proposed uses of the upgraded athletic facilities. The highest anticipated use of the
athletic facilities is a football game. While football games currently take place at the existing
athletic field, they occur in the afternoon during daylight hours. With the addition of new lighting,
football games are planned for around 6:30 PM.

The project study area is generally determined by the limits or extent of where 50 peak hour
project trips would travel to or from the site, which is based on Congestion Management
Program (CMP) guidelines. For this project, six intersections and three segments around the
project site were analyzed. City of San Diego engineering staff provided a list of two cumulative
projects near Herbert Hoover High School. Three scenarios were also analyzed, which included
Existing, Near-term without Project Conditions, and Near-term with Project Conditions.

No direct impacts were calculated by the anticipated project traffic; however, a shortage of 174
parking spaces is calculated when the ultimate parking supply of 223 is subtracted from an average
evening football game parking requirement of 397 spaces. The traffic and crowd control measures
currently in place for events at the school will be implemented for these additional evening
events made possible by the installation of stadium lighting, as determined necessary by school
officials.

Because the existing Byrd Middle School is in operation and traffic counts were taken while
school was in session, existing trips being generated by Byrd Middle School were taken as a
credit to avoid double counting trips. Thus, as shown in Table 3F-6, the Proposed Project would
generate 32 net new trips during the morning peak period by reconfiguring the existing Byrd
Middle School to high school uses. Table 3F-7 shows the trip generation rates for football
games.

Trip distribution assumptions were used to determine the origin and destination of the vehicle
trips associated with the Proposed Project. The trip distribution assumption include the trip
generation rates for the additional faculty and staff going into and out of the Proposed Project
site, the 50 percent of high school students that are assumed to drive and park in the project
vicinity. The geographic distribution of project trips was developed based on the location of the
Proposed Project. The trip distribution pattern is shown in Figure 3F-3. Using the project trip
generation and distribution pattern, the project-only traffic volumes were assigned to the street
network. Figure 3F-4 illustrates the resulting project-only morning peak period traffic volumes at
the study intersections associated with faculty and staff travel and students driving to the
Proposed Project site.

Abraham Lincoln High School (San Diego, California)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

for schools of the same name.

Abraham Lincoln High School (also known as Lincoln High
Educational Complex, Lincoln High School, or simply Lincoln), is                       Lincoln High School
an urban public high school that serves grades 9-12 in the American
K-12 education system in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Southeast
San Diego as part of the Encanto neighborhoods. It was named after
President Abraham Lincoln. Originally serving middle school
students, Lincoln was converted into a high school in 1955. The
school has produced several nationally recognized popular sports
figures.

In particular the school's Center for Social Justice [1] is educating San
Diego's increasing activist culture. On Tuesday, February 10, 2009 a        Established 1955 (as high school)
coalition of Lincoln High School along with Mission Bay High                Type         Senior High School
School, and several other schools including UC San Diego and San
Diego State sent hundreds of students, parents and teachers in support      Students     ~2400
of banning weapons training in San Diego schools. [2] The movement          Grades       9-12
is reminiscent of the 1969/1970 Lincoln Walkouts which lasted for 10
                                                                            Location     4777 Imperial Avenue,
days and resulted in the city's first Black principal. [3]

Construction of facilities in the 2000's                                    Razed        2003

Expansion of the school was done on existing facilities until 2003. On
September 24, 2003, Lincoln's cafeteria was the first building to be        Website      Lincoln High School web site
demolished.[4] The entire campus (with the exception of the gym) and
a few homes nearby would eventually be razed to make way for
construction of the new campus. This was a result of an elected ballot
proposition approved by its citizens, leaving many students displaced
and relocated to other high schools in the District. The campus
expanded with additional acquisition of property through eminent
domain.[5]

Before demolition, the campus had been infamous for its gang activity
for which college student hopeful Willie James Jones Jr. was gunned                             Lincoln High School
down just days before he was to matriculate to the prestigious Cornell
University, hitting major headlines all over San Diego media.[6] The
school also had been criticized for being behind academically, and there remained some skepticism in the community

about Lincoln's reopening over those criticisms. Pastor Roy Dixon was told by the principal that "kids entered Lincoln
with extremely low reading levels and could not perform academically."[7]

Lincoln High School was reopened on September 4, 2007. The new 24-acre (97,000 m2) campus was designed by
architect and Lincoln alum, Joseph Martinez (class of 1966), and rebuilt by many Lincoln alumni who took part in
construction of the school.[8] At a cost of $129 million, Lincoln is currently the most expensive campus in the San Diego
Unified School District.[8]

In its newly rebuilt form, Lincoln now features major improvements such as an increased student enrollment capacity of
2,700 (from an average of 800 students during Lincoln's last few years before demolition), a 790-seat performing arts
center, a football and track stadium that can seat 3,700, and other extra facilities for press and concessions. The
improvements addressed concerns over Lincoln's previously dilapidated and outdated facilities, proper allocation of
rooms per grade enrollment, and the increasing high school enrollment pressures of the neighborhood, in addition to
public input and suggestions given by members of the Lincoln community. The site also features modern, state-of-the-art
building design and facilities specialized to the curriculum.[8][9][10]

Lincoln High has also produced the second most NFL players in the entire nation.

Lincoln High School is currently divided into four small academies:[11]

       Lincoln 9th Grade Center for Social Justice
       Lincoln Center for the Arts
       Lincoln Center for Science and Engineering
       Lincoln Center for Public Safety

The centers' themes were the result of a 2005 parent survey.[8]

Notable alumni
       Marcus Allen, American football, Class of 1978[12][13]
       Terrell Davis, American football, Class of 1990[12]
       Jimmy Gunn, American football
       Dave Lewis, American football
       Akili Smith, American football
       Dominic McGuire, basketball
       Army Pt. Devon D. Jones, died in Iraq War[14]

The Capital Improvements Program (CIP) Budget supports construction projects, such as the development
of park land, the construction of sewer pump plants, the acquisition of land for City use, the installation
of traffic signals or street lighting systems, and the construction and remodeling of City facilities. These
funds are derived from various sources, including sewer and water fees, a one half-cent local sales tax
for transportation improvements (TransNet and TransNet Extension), development impact fees, sale of
City-owned property, and State and federal grants. The issuance of bonds is typically made for large and
costly projects such as deferred maintenance, sewer and water treatment plants, pump stations, and pipe
replacement or rehabilitation.


Overview of the Fiscal Year 2009 Annual CIP Budget
The Fiscal Year 2009 Annual CIP Budget totals $587.0 million. This is an increase of $95.3 million or
19.4 percent from the Fiscal Year 2008 Annual CIP Budget of $491.6 million. The increase in the Fiscal
Year 2009 Proposed CIP Budget is primarily due to an increase in funding for capital projects addressing
deferred maintenance needs.

Deferred maintenance and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) obligations are two of the eight
significant areas identified in the Five-Year Financial Outlook. The Annual CIP Budget includes $99.7
million for deferred maintenance projects for facilities, streets, storm drains, and sidewalks funded
by proceeds from land sales, Proposition 1B funds, and financing1. This is a significant increase from
the $30.0 million budgeted in Fiscal Year 2008 and reflects enhanced efforts to address the City's
estimated $800-$900 million backlog of deferred maintenance needs. The Fiscal Year 2009 Annual
CIP Budget includes approximately $11.0 million for ADA improvements funded by proceeds from land
sales and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). This is a reduction of $1.3 million from the
$12.3 million budgeted in Fiscal Year 2008 due to a reduction in CDBG funding available for ADA
improvements. In addition, the Annual CIP Budget includes $29.8 million of TransNet Extension cash and
commercial paper funding for transportation projects.

Water and sewer projects in the Fiscal Year 2009 Annual CIP Budget are funded by water and sewer rates.
On February 26, 2007, City Council approved water and sewer rate increases. Water rates will increase
6.5 percent each year through Fiscal Year 2011. Sewer rates increased 8.75 percent in May 2007 and May
2008, and will increase 7 percent in May 2009 and May 2010. The revenues generated from these rate
increases are projected to fund $585.0 million of water projects and $648.0 million of sewer projects over
this time period.

Table 1 and the chart following show the total Fiscal Year 2009 Annual CIP Budget by department. The
greatest increases in the Fiscal Year 2009 Annual CIP Budget are in the General Services Department for
deferred maintenance capital projects. The CIP Budget identifies $7.6 billion in total projected CIP project
costs through Fiscal Year 2019 for continuing, new, and future projects. Of this amount, $2.3 billion is
currently unidentified funding, including $545.4 million in projects that are fully unfunded.

    The City Attorney has raised some concerns over the legality of the proposed financing structure. The financing is expected to be
    implemented upon successful resolution of the legal concerns.

Capital Improvements Program


Future Outlook for the City's CIP
The Fiscal Year 2009 Annual CIP Budget increased by $95.3 million or 19.4 percent over Fiscal Year
2008. The Mayor is committed to funding ADA improvements and deferred maintenance capital projects
for City facilities and other City infrastructure. The CIP Budget identifies over $688.2 million of funding
for these capital needs through Fiscal Year 2013.

A CIP prioritization policy (Council Policy 800-14) was adopted for transportation projects in Fiscal
Year 2007. Currently, approximately 80 percent of existing transportation projects has been scored in
accordance with the detailed requirements in the Council Policy. It is anticipated that all transportation
projects will be scored and prioritized by the middle of Fiscal Year 2009, allowing for the use of this
prioritization in determining transportation project funding for the Fiscal Year 2010 CIP Budget.

Council Policy 800-14 was revised during Fiscal Year 2008 to incorporate the prioritization of all capital
projects. The scoring and prioritizing of all non-transportation CIP projects will require about two years.

                                     INTRODUCTION
The Ashley River is the western boundary of downtown Charleston. Travel across the river
near downtown is limited to US 17 (with Northbound traffic into downtown using the four-
lane T. Allen Legare Bridge, and Southbound traffic out of downtown using the three-lane
World War I Memorial Bridge) and the Robert B. Scarborough (SC 30) Bridge. Both of these
routes lack adequate bicycle and pedestrian facilities, which makes non-motorized travel
across the Ashley River between the West Ashley community and downtown Charleston
challenging and unsafe. The Northbound US 17 Bridge was identified to be the best
candidate on which to construct a shareduse path. Originally, the addition of a cantilevered
pathway to the bridge was studied, but it was determined to be infeasible due to the loading
constraints of the bridge bascule structure. The next alternative requested to be evaluated
was the use of the outside lane of the Northbound US  17 Bridge as a barrier-separated
shared use bicycle and pedestrian lane, which would leave three lanes on the bridge for
motorized traffic.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impacts to motor vehicle traffic of eliminating
one travel lane on the Northbound US 17 Bridge and its immediate approach in order to
accommodate a barrier-separated two-way shared use path in the space currently used as
the fourth travel lane. The evaluation has been completed through the use of the traffic
engineering software VISSIM, which simulates the traffic operations of the area on the
approach to the bridge, where Folly Road, US 17, and SC 61 merge together to create the
existing four lane section. VISSIM analysis methods are used because the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) methods are limited to freeway-ramp configurations and simple
weave sections. However, the roadway and ramp configuration in the study area has
multiple origin and destination points, which creates a complex section with twelve possible
lane origin-destination pairs and nine separate weaving sections. Because the complex
configuration of the study area exceeds the limitations of the HCM methods, the most
appropriate way to evaluate the section is to simulate it.

                  DATA COLLECTION AND FIELD OBSERVATIONS
Based on previous studies and traffic data, the highest volumes of the day on the
Northbound US 17 Bridge occur during the AM peak period. As such, the data collection for
this project focused on conditions during the AM peak, corresponding with commuter traffic
traveling into downtown Charleston from the West Ashley community. The data included
roadway counts using automatic traffic recorders (ATRs), AM peak period intersection
turning movement counts, and travel time runs.

Field observations were performed by the study team May 16th and 17th, and included
observations of traffic flow, vehicle platooning, queues, and weaving and merging
characteristics. Photos and videos were collected at numerous points within the study area
to document the existing conditions.

Traffic Counts

Roadway traffic counts were collected at the following locations to support the development
of the VISSIM traffic simulation model:

   1.   SC 61 Ramp to US 17 Northbound
   2.   US 17 Northbound, south of merge with Folly Road
   3.   Folly Road, north of Albemarle Road
   4.   US 17 Northbound, north of the Bee Street/Lockwood Drive Off-Ramp
   5.   Bee Street/Lockwood Drive Off-Ramp
   6.   Bee Street/Lockwood Drive Northbound Ramp

The first three locations listed above were counted for 72 consecutive hours from May 10-
12, 2011. The last three locations listed above were counted for a 24-hour period on June
14, 2011.

The signalized intersections located upstream from the existing four-lane section needed to
be modeled to replicate field operations, such as the platoons dispersing from the signals.
AM peak period (7-9 AM) turning movement counts were collected at three (3) intersections,
as follows:

   1. SC 61/Wesley Drive
   2. US 17/Wesley Drive
   3. Folly Road/Albemarle Road

Figure 1 shows the study area and traffic count locations. All traffic counts are provided in
Appendix A (Automated Roadway Traffic Counts) and Appendix B (Turning Movement
Counts).

The measured percentage of heavy vehicles from the roadway counts during the AM peak
hour varied from 0.6% on Folly Road to 2.3% on SC 61. These values were similar to the
global 2% heavy vehicle value previously used in the VISSIM analysis for the US 17/SC 61
Improvements Project (Wilbur Smith Associates, August 2007). As such, the global 2%
heavy vehicle value was maintained in the VISSIM modeling for this project.

Travel Time Runs
Travel time is the critical measure of effectiveness (MOE) for the analysis of this project, and
as such, existing travel time data was collected for each of the three roadways that
converge to make up the four-lane section on US 17 Northbound. Four (4) travel time runs
each were completed during the AM peak period (7-9 AM) for SC 61, US 17, and Folly
Road, ending on the Bee Street/Lockwood Drive Off-Ramp, as shown in Figure 2. The
existing condition travel time results were used to calibrate the VISSIM model, and then to
compare the projected travel times based on the proposed three-lane section. All traffic
counts are provided in Appendix C.

Field Observations

The following observations were made during the AM peak period for the study area:

       Observed traffic flows during the AM
       peak period (7-9 AM) were relatively
       heavy within the four-lane section on US
       17 Northbound on the bridge and the
       approach to the bridge. However, the
       volumes and lane changing maneuvers in
       this section rarely resulted in any
       noticeable speed decreases.          The
       slowdowns that were observed were
       typically the result of a single vehicle
       making a lane change during a period of AM peak traffic flow in the four-lane section
       heavy traffic flow, affecting only the approaching the bridge (looking south).
       vehicles accommodating the maneuver;
       once the lane change was complete, free-flow conditions were quickly resumed.
       Traffic flow is regulated by the upstream signals on each of the three roadways that
       join together to make up the four-lane section. It was observed that vehicle platoons
       from each signal generally arrived at the four-lane section at about the same time,
       which created periods of heavier traffic flow, which would be followed by shorter
       periods with very little traffic. It may be possible to modify the signal coordination to
       separate the vehicle platoons from the three roadways somewhat to provide for more
       uniform traffic flow through the four-lane section.
       The Folly Road approach to the four-lane section has relatively uniform lane
       utilization. Based on field observations, approximately 55% of the Folly Road traffic
       uses the outside lane, with 45% using the inside lane.
       The lane merge for the US 17
       Northbound approach to the four-lane
       section occurs suddenly over a short
       distance (approximately 375 feet from the
       first sign and pavement markings
       informing motorists the left lane ends and
       to merge right). Because the majority of
       drivers during the AM peak are likely
       commuters who drive the corridor
       regularly and know about the sudden lane
       merge, it was observed that most drivers       The short US 17 merge area on the approach to
       had already merged into the right lane         the Northbound US 17 Bridge.
       prior to the lane merge.

   On the north side of the Northbound US 17 Bridge, the four lane section splits with
   three lanes continuing on US 17 Northbound, and a two-lane off-ramp to Bee Street
   and Lockwood Drive. In this configuration, the second lane from the right (in the
   direction of travel) allows traffic to either exit to the off-ramp or continue on US 17
   Northbound. Along the off-ramp, the left lane provides access to Bee Street and
   Northbound Lockwood Drive via a signalized intersection, while the right lane is a
   free flow movement onto Southbound Lockwood Drive. Queues from the Bee
   Street/Lockwood Drive off-ramp signal were observed to back up near the end of the
   off-ramp, but were never observed to back onto the US 17 mainline or affect
   diverging traffic operations at the off-ramp.

     continuing on US 17 and a two-lane off-ramp. (Right) Queuing on the Bee Street/Lockwood Drive off-ramp.

   No pedestrians or bicyclists were observed using the US 17 Northbound Bridge,
   although this is expected due to the lack of dedicated facilities (only an approximate
   two-foot wide curb located adjacent to the low bridge railing is available). However,
   there were a number of pedestrians and bicyclists observed using the US 17
   Southbound Bridge, which provides an approximate four-foot wide sidewalk on the
   outside of the bridge. Along this sidewalk, bicyclists were observed traveling in both
   directions. Although no instances were observed in which bicyclists traveling in
   opposite directions met on the bridge, the narrow sidewalk width would make
   passing very challenging and dangerous in this situation.

   No drawbridge activity was observed during the field review. Activation of the draw
   bridge during the AM peak period would result in queues extending into the area of
   the junction of US 17, Folly Road, and SC 61. At the completion of a drawbridge
   cycle when traffic began to move again, weaving operations would be negatively
   affected due to the higher traffic demand and vehicle density within the four-lane
   section.

                       EVALUATION OF THREE-LANE SECTION
The evaluation of the removal of one travel lane on the Northbound US 17 Bridge and its
approach in order to accommodate a barrier-separated shared use path was completed
using the traffic simulation software, VISSIM. VISSIM is a microsimulation software that is
widely used across the country to evaluate traffic operations within complex geometric
configurations. VISSIM was previously used to evaluate the traffic operations in the West
Ashley community as part of the RoadWise US 17/SC 61 Improvements Project. The
VISSIM files from that previous project were obtained from the County and used as the
starting point in this evaluation of the Northbound US 17 Bridge. VISSIM allows the impacts
of downstream disturbances and capacity issues to propagate back through the model;
therefore, the traffic operation within each individual segment is influenced by the operations
in adjacent segments and the study area as a whole. In contrast, the methods used in the
HCM only look at isolated locations and do not fully account for queue spillback in the
analysis.

Measures of Effectiveness

The MOEs that will be used in this project include travel time, average speed, density, and
level of service (LOS). As mentioned previously, travel time is the critical MOE because the
reduction of a travel lane will more greatly affect the roadway density and LOS. However,
even if traffic flow is denser, the difference in travel time through the study area may not
change significantly.

To determine an overall LOS for the entire study area, an average of the LOS thresholds for
density was computed from the thresholds in the 2000 HCM for various facility types
including multilane highway basic sections, multilane highway weaving sections, and ramp
junctions (merge/diverge areas). This resulted in a single set of LOS values, which are
shown in Table 1. The VISSIM simulation reports a density, volume and speed for each link
segment by lane. Using weighted averages based on link volume, a weighted average
density can be developed for each alternative.

Calibration of Existing Conditions Model

Calibration of any simulation model is important to achieving reliable results. The existing
model was calibrated based on several inputs, most importantly of which is travel time
based on the series of travel time runs completed from each of the three roadway origin
points to the Bee Street/Lockwood Drive Off-Ramp. The traffic counts collected also
included speed data for each location, which was used as an additional measure to calibrate
the model. Finally, several other model inputs were adjusted to help calibrate travel time,
including desired free flow speed curves designed for each study segment, and driver
parameters in merge areas.
The existing travel time ranges based on the four travel time runs completed for each
roadway are summarized in Table 2. As shown, the travel times along the paths shown in
Figure 2 for US 17 and SC 61 were similar, at approximately 90 to 100 seconds. The travel
time along Folly Road, a shorter path, was between 72 and 79 seconds.

The calibration of existing conditions in the VISSIM model included a comparison of the
average results from five (5) runs to the target travel time range. For US 17, the travel time
was calculated to be 91 seconds, which was within the target range of measured travel
times. The average travel time for SC 61 was marginally lower than the target range, but
was judged to be acceptable. The average travel time for Folly Road was within the target
range.

Figure 3 shows the existing AM peak hour volumes on the roadways within the study area.
As shown, the Folly Road approach has the highest peak hour volume, with US 17
contributing the second highest volume, and SC 61 the lowest. In total, the four-lane section
on the bridge and its immediate approach has an AM peak hour volume of nearly 4,150.
Figure 3 also shows the volumes traveling from each origin point to each destination point
within the study area.

To calibrate the volumes, the VISSIM output for the five runs was compared to the existing
2011 volumes. These volumes represent the total number of vehicles that are recorded in
the simulation network and are directly comparable to the measured traffic counts. In order
to achieve proper calibration, the average VISSIM volumes need to be within 15% of the
existing volumes.

Three-Lane Section Alternatives

Due to the previous traffic studies completed and alternatives evaluated in the West Ashley
community, there were limited new options available for eliminating one travel lane on the
Northbound US 17 Bridge and its approach. Because it was desired to maintain the single
lane for SC 61 rather than having this ramp merge into the section, and US 17 already
merges to a single lane, the most feasible option for removing a lane was to merge the two
lanes from the Folly Road approach into a single lane. This would result in each roadway
(SC 61, US 17, and Folly Road) contributing one lane to the three-lane section. For this
study, three (3) alternatives were developed for merging the two Folly Road lanes down to a
single lane. The alternatives varied the location of the merge point. In each alternative, the
merge distance was set to 600 feet, based on South Carolina Department of Transportation
(SCDOT) design standards. The three alternatives are described below.

Alternative 1

In this alternative, the merge would occur at the soonest point available to the east of the
Albemarle Road intersection. SCDOT design standards require a minimum of 360 feet for
lane merging based on the posted speed of 35 mph, so the merge was set to begin 360 feet
beyond the point where the Albemarle Road channelized right turn joins Folly Road. The
600-foot long lane merge distance results in the merge completion at about the junction
point with US 17. Figure 4 shows the location and length of the lane merge, as well as the
lane configurations in the study area. The biggest benefit of this alternative is that all Folly
Road traffic would have merged and would be traveling in a single lane prior to the junction
of US 17 traffic, and prior to the point where lane changing and weaving operations would
begin. However, the short distance available beyond the Albemarle Road signal before the
merge begins could lead to less balanced lane utilization at the Albemarle signal, which
could result in poorer intersection operations.

Alternative 2

In Alternative 2, the merge is designed to be completed at about the junction of the SC 61
Ramp. With a 600-foot lane merge length, the merge would begin shortly after the junction
with US 17, as shown in Figure 5. The benefit of placing the merge length in this location is
that it would provide for a longer distance on the Folly Road approach before the merge
section begins. One issue is that moving the merge beyond the junction with US 17 will
place it in an area where vehicles from both Folly Road and US 17 are beginning to change
lanes and weave, meaning there is more potential for turbulent traffic flow.

Alternative 3

Alternative 3 places the 600-foot lane merge length as far east as possible before reaching
the Northbound US 17 Bridge. As shown in Figure 6, the merge would begin just east of
the junction point of the SC 61 Ramp. Similar to Alternative 2, a primary benefit of this
alternative is more usable lane space prior to the merge, but the location of the merge is in a
section following the junction of the SC 61 Ramp where lane changing and weaving
maneuvers dramatically increase which again would likely result in more turbulent traffic
flow.

Future 2030 Analysis

Future Conditions Traffic Projections

Traffic volumes for 2030 were obtained from the US 17/SC 61 Improvements Project
completed by Wilbur Smith Associates in August 2007 for the Charleston County RoadWise
program shown in Appendix E. Although two future 2030 alternatives were included in that
report, this analysis has used the more conservative alternative that does not include the I-
526 Extension project. As such, the 2030 analysis represents a "worst case" analysis.
Because no future volume was specified in the US 17/SC 61 Improvements Project report
for the SC 61 Ramp to Northbound US 17, the volume was developed by taking the ratio of
traffic on the ramp to the existing southbound SC 61 volume departing the Wesley Drive
intersection (60%) and applying it to the future southbound SC 61 volume departing the
Wesley Drive intersection. Future volumes on the north side of the Ashley River at the Bee
Street/Lockwood Drive Off-Ramp were developed using the same percentages as the
existing condition. The 2030 AM peak hour volumes are shown in Figure 7.

It should be noted that the 2030 volumes represent a total growth of 39% from the 2011
volumes on the Northbound US 17 Bridge, but a 43% growth on Folly Road and 54% growth
on the SC 61 Ramp. With such a significant change in traffic volumes, the bridge and its
immediate approach may not represent the critical segment, even with only three travel
lanes. It is more likely that the upstream traffic signals would meter the traffic such that the
entire demand traffic flow would not clear the signalized intersections to the study section on
the approach to the bridge.

To help ensure the most efficient traffic flow in the future, it is recommended that an area-
wide approach be taken for future traffic signal re-timing projects in the West Ashley area, in
which the traffic flow and signal timings along US 17, SC 61, Folly Road, and Wesley Drive
would be evaluated concurrently. This would include maximizing intersection volume
throughput, as well as evaluating the feasibility of offsetting the upstream intersection signal
timings such that vehicle platoons would not arrive at the merge area concurrently.
Spreading the arrivals of vehicle platoons from the three originating roadways' upstream
signals would benefit the bridge and its approach by reducing vehicle densities in that
section. However, assessing the feasibility of this strategy would require balancing the
platoon improvements in this section with the efficiency of traffic operations and signal
timing coordination on multiple corridors.

Model Modification/Constraints

The 2030 study area volumes are demand volumes, which are not necessarily achievable
by the current roadway network. As discussed above, the actual volumes in the study area
may be limited by the lane configuration and signal timing at the signalized intersections.
The future traffic demand at the US 17/Wesley Drive intersection exceeds its capacity based
on its existing lane geometry and optimized signal timing. As such, the volume that can

proceed through this intersection and continue northbound on US 17 would be less than the
2030 volume projections unless improvements are made to increase the intersection's
capacity. The addition of an eastbound right-turn lane (for the US 17 to southbound Wesley
Drive turning movement) would allow an increased volume to be processed into the study
area on the approach to the bridge and help bring the actual volumes closer to the demand
volumes. Therefore, this improvement was included in each of the 2030 alternatives.

This eastbound right turn lane was added to the simulation network solely to allow the
demand network volume from US 17 to enter the study segment without capacity constraint,
thereby allowing the full 2030 traffic demand (worst case scenario) to be evaluated. It is
not recommended to construct this eastbound right turn lane as a component of this
proposed project. However, the right turn lane addition may warrant further discussion at
some point in the future should US 17 through vehicle capacity be severely restricted. It
should be noted that this modified link in the simulation network is not used in the calculation
of the reported MOE's.

Folly Road, which has an even higher projected volume in 2030 than US 17, will have even
more severe limitations to its total volume throughput. The signalized intersections to the
south of the study area will limit the overall traffic that can be processed through the
network.

Analysis Results

Table 4 provides the results of the VISSIM analysis for both the 2011 existing conditions
and the projected 2030 future conditions and provides comparative results in terms of
average travel time (in seconds), average speed (mph), volume (verification that the
demand volumes actually were processed into the study area network), average density
across the study area (vehicles/mile/lane), and LOS. As discussed previously, the density
value used to determine the overall LOS is based on a weighted average of the individual
lane densities across the entire study area, which begins immediately downstream of the
last signalized intersection for the SC 61, US 17, and Folly Road approaches, and ends at
the Bee Street/Lockwood Drive Off-Ramp.

2011 Results

The results of the VISSIM analysis for the 2011 existing conditions shows that the overall
vehicle density will increase enough to drop the LOS from C to E (with the exception of
Alternative 3, which would be at LOS D). This is not unexpected since the removal of one
lane will have a direct effect on the overall average density of the study area. However,
while density increased, the travel times and average speeds through the study area were
not significantly impacted. For example, the average travel time on the Folly Road approach
increased by only 13 seconds in the worst alternative, going from 76 seconds with the
existing geometry to 89 seconds in Alternative 1. Alternatives 2 and 3 provided slightly
better results with travel time increases of 10 and 8 seconds, respectively, compared to the
existing lane geometry. These travel time differences resulted in a drop in average speed
from 37 mph to 31 mph in Alternative 1, or 33 mph in Alternatives 2 and 3. The travel time
results for US 17 and SC 61 were less affected than those on Folly Road because the lane
merge directly affects the Folly Road traffic. The US 17 travel time was shown to increase
by only 6 seconds at most, while the SC 61 travel time was shown to increase by only 4
seconds at most.

Comparing the three alternatives in terms of travel time and average speed, Alternative 1 is
shown to perform the poorest, while Alternative 3 performs marginally better than Alternative
2. The better performance of Alternatives 2 and 3 may be somewhat misleading because
the faster travel speeds and slightly lower travel times can be at least partially attributed to
the fact that the lane merge occurs later in the study section compared to Alternative 1. As
discussed previously, Alternative 1 is attractive because the traffic from Folly Road would be
merged into a single lane by the US 17 junction point. As such, while the traffic flow will be
denser and speeds slightly slower, there would be fewer potential conflicts between vehicles
making lane changes. With Alternatives 2 or 3, there is a higher probability that a vehicle
from US 17 or SC 61 may try to change lanes to the right at the same time and location as a
vehicle from Folly Road is trying to merge left, and thereby competing for the same space.

LevelofService is based on a composite of HCM 2000 LOS thresholds for multilane highway, 
multilane highway weave, and ramp junction (merge/diverge).

2030 Results

The VISSIM result for the 2030 future condition with the existing lane geometry shows that
the average density is projected to be LOS F, although only marginally beyond the upper
threshold for LOS E (density of 44.0 versus LOS E threshold of 42.5). By interpolating the
study area average density between the 2011 values and the 2030 values for the existing
geometry, it is estimated that the LOS E threshold would not be exceeded until
approximately 2028 with no changes to the existing four-lane section.

The results of the three alternatives in 2030 show very high densities, very slow speeds, and
lengthy travel times. These LOS F conditions result from congestion at the Bee
Street/Lockwood Drive Off-Ramp and on the bridge, which propagates back to each of the
three originating roadways. Maintaining a three-lane section for US 17 at and downstream
of the Bee Street/Lockwood Drive Off-Ramp would require that the off-ramp only have a
single lane rather than the two lane off-ramp provided today. The total peak hour volume


                                                                  Ashley River Bridge Traffic Study

projected to exit at the Bee Street/Lockwood Drive Off-Ramp is approximately 2,580, which
exceeds the capacity of a single lane off-ramp. This single lane capacity constraint results
in a bottleneck that prevents drivers from making efficient lane changes to access the off-
ramp, thereby causing excessive congestion.

To help solve this capacity issue, a modified lane configuration was evaluated at the Bee
Street/Lockwood Drive Off-Ramp, in which a two-lane ramp would be provided, but only two
lanes would continue for the Northbound US 17 through movement. In this configuration,
the middle lane of the three-lane section would allow vehicles to either exit to Bee
Street/Lockwood Drive or continue on US 17. Because the existing US 17 section
downstream of this off-ramp has three lanes, the section could widen back out from two to
three lanes immediately to the north of the off-ramp area. The base and modified lane
configurations at the off-ramp are shown in Figure 8.

The results of the 2030 future condition with the modified lane geometry are also shown in
Table 4. The modified geometry improves traffic flow in the off-ramp diverge area, which
results in significantly lower average densities compared to the alternatives with the base
lane geometry. Despite the improvements, the 2030 LOS for each of the three alternatives
is F. However, as with the 2011 alternatives, the 2030 modified geometry alternatives do
not show large degradation in travel time and average speed compared to the existing 2011
condition. The largest increase in travel time is 19 seconds for US 17 in Alternative 2, while
the largest reduction in average speed is 7 mph for Folly Road in Alternative 1 (although the
average speed is still 30 mph).

These results show that the proposed three-laning of the Ashley River Bridge and its
approach is feasible during the near term without causing significant increases in vehicle
travel time through the section. The projected 2030 demand volumes will cause the study
area as a whole to be over capacity. As discussed previously, the metering effect of the
upstream signals will prevent the entire demand volume from entering the study section
during a one-hour period. This is particularly true for the Folly Road approach, whose future
demand volume exceeds 2,300 vehicles per hour. As such, the magnitude of the 2030
results, particularly for the modified lane geometry condition are likely overestimated, and
would not be as severe due to the metering of traffic entering this section.

Despite having slightly longer travel times, particularly for the Folly Road approach,
Alternative 1 provides the safest alternative in terms of limiting the potential for weaving and
lane changing conflicts following the junction with US 17. As such, Alternative 1 is the
recommended alternative.

The three-lane section concept does have capacity to allow for regional traffic growth
beyond 2011. By interpolating the study area average density between the 2011 values and
the 2030 values for the Alternative 1 modified geometry, the LOS E threshold would not be
exceeded until approximately 2020. If traffic does not grow as projected (and the recent
history of the area has shown a flattening volume trend), or if another project is completed

that provides capacity relief on another facility, such as the I-526 Extension, the three-lane
section would operate adequately beyond 2020.

Documentation of the VISSIM model development, such as the origin-destination matrix
used for traffic volume assignment, as well as the output files, are included in Appendix F.

Drawbridge Operations

The traffic simulation does not take into consideration the conditions during a drawbridge
activation event since such an event does not typically occur during the AM peak hour.
However, it should be noted that that implementing the recommended three-lane alternative
would result in queuing for 78 fewer vehicles on the bridge and its immediate approach
during a drawbridge activation event. This reduction was computed by measuring the lane
length that would be eliminated in the recommended alternative, measured from the lane
merge point to the draw bridge stop bar (1,950 feet) and dividing by the average vehicle
length of 25 feet.

Analysis of Lane Change Volume

Another result that should be understood of removing a travel lane is the impact on the
number of lane changes within the study section. Table 5 presents a list of the 12 possible
lane change maneuvers to get from the origin points to the destination points with the
existing four lane section, the volume for each movement, the minimum number of lane
changes required to get from the origin to the destination, and the total lane change volume.
The table includes the same data for the three lane alternative under both the base lane
geometry and modified lane geometry at the Bee Street/Lockwood Drive Off-Ramp.
Volumes for both 2011 and 2030 are represented.

As shown in Table 5, the existing four-lane section results in a minimum of 3,484 lane
changes from the total 2011 section peak hour volume of 4,147 vehicles. By going with the
base three-lane section, the number of lane changes decreases by about half to 1,693.
With the modified three-lane section, the lane changes still decrease compared to the four-
lane section, but not as dramatically. This is because the modified geometry requires one
lane change for the Folly Road traffic to continue northbound on US 17 whereas no lane
change was required in the base three-lane geometry.

The results for 2030 are similar to those in 2011. The number of 2030 lane changes with
the modified three-lane geometry is only marginally higher than the existing lane changes
today with the existing four-lane section.

Ashley River Bridge Traffic Study
                  August 5, 2011
                                                                                 Assumes 55% of existing Folly Rd traffic uses outside  lane, and 45% uses inside  lane, based on field observations.
                       CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This study has evaluated the traffic operational impacts that would occur if one travel lane
were removed from the Northbound US 17 Bridge over the Ashley River and its approach in
order to accommodate a barrier-separated two-way shared use path in the space currently
used by the fourth travel lane. Based on use of a VISSIM traffic simulation model that was
calibrated to the existing travel time and travel speeds of the four-lane section, the results of
the three-lane alternatives showed that the lane reduction is feasible today with little impact
to travel times or speeds from any of the roadways entering the study section. The three-
lane section will continue to be feasible to about the year 2020. After that point, the average
vehicle density within the study area will increase to the point where it exceeds a LOS E
threshold. However, if volumes do not grow as projected or additional capacity is provided
on another facility that would result in traffic diversion away from the study area, the section
could continue to operate acceptably with a three-lane section for significantly longer. With
no changes to the existing four lane section, the LOS is projected to reach LOS F by 2028.

The recommendations from the study are as follows:

       Implement the three-lane section in order to accommodate the shared use path
       across the Ashley River. The recommended alternative is Alternative 1, which
       despite having slightly longer travel times, particularly for the Folly Road approach,
       provides the safest alternative in terms of limiting the potential for weaving and lane
       changing conflicts following the junction with US 17. It should be noted that
       implementing this alternative would result in queuing for 78 fewer vehicles within this
       section during a drawbridge activation event.
       Modify the Bee Street/Lockwood Drive Off-Ramp area using the modified lane
       geometry, which includes maintaining a two-lane off-ramp, but limiting the US 17
       through movement to two lanes at the diverge point (which can be expanded back to
       three lanes immediately following the off-ramp diverge area). In addition, it is
       recommended to provide additional queuing space on the off-ramp by constructing
       an exclusive left turn lane; the existing shared left/through lane would become an
       exclusive through lane to Bee Street.
       The existing lane merge on the US 17 approach is short (about 375 feet) and occurs
       suddenly. It is recommended that additional signage be provided further back and
       additional pavement markings provided to warn motorists of the upcoming lane
       merge. Per SCDOT design standards, a minimum lane merge distance of 600 feet
       should be provided.
       Use an area-wide approach for future traffic signal re-timing projects in the West
       Ashley area, in which the traffic flow and signal timings along US 17, SC 61, Folly
       Road, and Wesley Drive would be evaluated concurrently. This would include
       maximizing intersection volume throughput, as well as evaluating the feasibility of
       offsetting the upstream intersection signal timings such that vehicle platoons would



                                                                 Ashley River Bridge Traffic Study

   not arrive at the merge area concurrently. Spreading the arrivals of vehicle platoons
   from the three originating roadways' upstream signals would benefit the bridge and
   its approach by reducing vehicle densities in that section. However, assessing the
   feasibility of this strategy would require balancing the platoon improvements in this
   section with the efficiency of traffic operations and signal timing coordination on
   multiple corridors.
   Further study is recommended in order to provide an optimal and safe condition for
   both motorized and non-motorized traffic alongside the barrier, which will be needed
   to separate the respective traffic flows. This includes defining the type of barrier to
   be used, the appropriate placement to maximize space for the pathway without
   causing a safety issue for the outside travel lane, and the treatment on the bridge
   bascule where weight will be an issue. It should also be determined how best to
   provide connections to the pathway on both sides of the river, including roadway
   crossings. This includes connections from SC 61 and US 17 in the West Ashley
   community to the West Ashley Greenway which would connect directly to this
   proposed pathway, as well as connections along Lockwood Drive and to Calhoun
   Street in downtown Charleston.

RE: Response to Comments ­ Ashley River Traffic Study (DRAFT)

The purpose of this memo is to provide responses to the review comments received regarding the draft
Ashley River Bridge Traffic Study, dated July 7, 2011. This project was performed for Charleston County
under the RoadWise Program. Below are the responses to the comments received.

Comments from The LPA Group (Rob Dubnicka, P.E. /Quazi Masood, P.E.):
Review comments were dated July 18, 2011.

Comments on VISSIM Model

        1. The traffic study (in page 16) proposes addition of right-turn lane at US 17 and Wesley Drive
           intersection to accommodate heavy eastbound US 17 to southbound Wesley Drive movement.
           However, the 2030 VISSIM model shows that instead of a right-turn storage lane a separate travel
           lane about 6,800 feet long has been added along the eastbound US 17 direction. The outside
           eastbound travel lane was dropped as a right-turn lane at Wesley Drive intersection. The report
           should include a recommended right-turn storage length and the model should be revised to be
           consistent with the length.

           Response: The eastbound right turn lane was added to the simulation network solely to allow the
           demand network volume from US 17 to enter the study segment without capacity constraint, thereby
           allowing the full 2030 traffic demand (worst case scenario) to be evaluated. If the right turn lane
           were changed based on the above comment, it may not achieve the desired affect of processing the
           demand volume. As such, the simulation model is not proposed to be changed. Further, the report
           does not recommend the addition of this eastbound right turn lane as a component of this proposed
           project. However, the right turn lane addition may warrant further discussion at some point in the
           future should US 17 through vehicle capacity be severely restricted. It is beyond the scope of the
           current project to develop a design configuration and recommended storage length for this potential
           future turn lane.

        2. The traffic study (in page 23) proposes widening of US 17 to a three-lane section at                      a location
           immediately downstream of the Lockwood Drive/Bee Street ramp gore.
              a. The 2030 VISSIM model for the modified alternatives do not match this                               geometric
                   layout.
              b. Although this geometric modification would not have any significant impact on                       the traffic
                   operation, we recommend revising the 2030 VISSIM files to match the proposed                      geometric
                   configurations.

           Response: We agree the recommended geometry does not match the VISSIM model geometry at
           this point. We also agree that the VISSIM results would not be affected with this recommendation
           due to this link being at the edge of the model with no downstream signal or other feature affecting
           the vehicles' travel patterns. As such, it is not proposed to update the model laneage configuration.

        3. In all of the existing and future year VISSIM model files; the `Link Evaluation' command under `Link

          Data>Other>Evaluation' show default link distances of 9,999.0 feet. The default values should be
          revised to reflect the actual lengths of the respective links.

          Response: We are checking with PTV on this issue, but believe that because the Link Evaluation
          Segment Length for the network was set to a fixed value, the individual link lengths referred to in the
          comment do not overwrite the set Link Evaluation Segment Length. Because adjusting the individual
          link lengths as described in the comment would have no bearing on the results, no adjustments are
          proposed to be made.

     4. The traffic volumes for the following four VISSIM model alternatives                were inserted for different
        simulation lengths:

                           2011 AM: The volumes were inserted for 0-600 seconds;
                           AM_Alt 1_2011: The volumes were inserted for 0-600 seconds;
                           AM_Alt 1_2030: The volumes were inserted for 0-1,500 seconds;
                           AM_Alt 1_2030 Modified: The volumes were inserted for 0-1,800 seconds.

          We suggest using a consistent simulation length to simulate the traffic volumes for all alternatives.
          For example, a timeframe of 0-4,500 seconds could be used to provide a 15 minute network seeding
          interval and a 60 minute simulation period.

          Response: The volume errors mentioned above were the product of a conversion from Dynamic
          VISSIM files to Static Routed VISSIM files. The original Dynamic files were submitted to the
          reviewing agency on July 14 and do not contain these discrepancies; all files reflect volumes inserted
          for 0-4500 seconds.


Comments on Traffic Report

     5. The Bee Street ramp is controlled by a traffic signal at the end of the ramp. The study should
        include the impact of this signal during the future year 2030 operation. The queue lengths
        should be evaluated to demonstrate that the peak hour traffic would not back up onto any study
        network and/or the Ashley River Bridge.

          Response: The full impacts of the Bee Street Ramp/Lockwood Drive intersection cannot be
          determined without having 2030 traffic volume projections for Lockwood Drive. Developing future
          2030 volume projections is outside the scope of this project, and 2030 traffic projections for this area
          on the Downtown Charleston side of the Ashley River were not included in the US 17/SC 61
          Improvements Project report (Wilbur Smith, Associates, August 2007). Future conditions are
          currently approximated based on the calibration of existing conditions (observed queuing) with signal
          green time maintained in the future.

          It is important to note that the No Build condition provides approximately 650 feet of queue storage
          space for through and left turning traffic on the Bee Street ramp before vehicles would queue back
          onto the US 17 mainline. In the 2030 No Build Alternative, this storage length would remain
          unchanged. However, in the Recommended Alternative, an additional left turn lane is proposed,
          which would provide an approximate 450 feet of additional queue storage (an increase of nearly
          70%). Because the outside (right-most) lane in both the No Build and Recommended Alternatives
          provides direct access to the free flow lane to southbound Lockwood Drive, no queuing is anticipated
                                                                                    nd
          to occur in that lane. Queuing would only potentially be expected in the 2 lane from the right which
          provides direct access to the through and left turn movements on the Bee Street ramp. Because the
          Recommended Alternative provides more queue storage than the No Build Alternative, the No Build
          Alternative would have traffic queues back onto the US 17 mainline before the Recommended
          Alternative, given equivalent 2030 traffic volumes and signal timings.

     6. The conclusion section (page 26) of the traffic report discusses the queuing of 78 fewer vehicles
        during the drawbridge operation. This is the only place the drawbridge operation is mentioned in the

          report. We suggest adding a discussion of the drawbridge queuing in the main text of the traffic
          report and explain how the queue length was calculated.

          Response: The body of the report will be modified to include a discussion of the reduced queuing
          space during drawbridge operations. The value of 78 vehicles was computed simply from taking the
          lane length that would be eliminated in the Recommended Alternative, measured from the lane
          merge point to the draw bridge stop bar (1,950 feet) and dividing by the average vehicle length of 25
          feet.

     7. The traffic study does not include any discussion about the heavy vehicle mix and/or the heavy
        vehicle volumes. The traffic volumes used in the VISSIM model shows a separate vehicle class
        named `Cars + HGV'. If the data is available, the heavy vehicle traffic should be inserted
        separately from the automobiles in all the VISSIM models.

          Response: A discussion will be added to the report to address this topic. The Car+HGV percentage
          in the VISSIM model was carried forward from the previous US 17/SC 61 Improvements Project.
          The data collected for this project showed that heavy vehicle percentages compared favorably to the
          traffic characteristics used in the previous study.

     8. Page 8, first paragraph, ninth line: It should be `downstream' instead of `upstream'.

          Response: Agreed, report will be revised.

     9. Page 8, Table 1: The `V/C' text shown in LOS E row of the ramp column should be replaced by
        a numerical value (i.e. 36, based on HCM 2000, page 25-5).

          Response: Report will be updated to show ">35" instead of "V/C".

     10. Page 16, second paragraph: The report mentions that the upstream signals would meter traffic. The
         conclusion section (page 26) also describes offsetting the upstream intersection signals in order to
         avoid merging of the multi-directional vehicle platoon concurrently. Is it possible to provide more
         detail regarding the feasibility of the proposed signal offset plan to support this statement?

          Response: Spreading the arrivals of vehicle platoons coming from the three origination points over a
          larger period of time to avoid the platoons arriving concurrently would have obvious benefits on the
          bridge section and its approach in terms of lower densities. However, at this time, it is not possible to
          provide more detail about the feasibility of this potential strategy. Assessing the feasibility of this
          idea would require testing and evaluating alternative signal timing in order to maximize the efficiency
          of the operations on the Ashley River Bridge and its approach, while still balancing the efficiency of
          traffic operations and timing coordination along multiple corridors, including US 17, Folly Road, SC
          61, and Wesley Drive. It is not known whether this strategy is feasible or if implementing it would
          cause unacceptable traffic operations on one or more corridors, or for the area as a whole. The most
          appropriate time to evaluate the feasibility of this strategy would be during the next signal re-timing
          project for the West Ashley area, when the impacts of modifying signal offsets could be studied in a
          comprehensive manner.

     11. Page 20, bottom of Table 4: The * footnote should refer to `downstream capacity' instead of
         `upstream capacity'. Additional clarification is also needed. It does not seem feasible that an
         intersection located at the northern terminus of the model would limit traffic flow of the southern
         study segments. If this were to occur, it would result from congestion at the northern backing up all
         the way across the bridge to each of the entry links. In this situation, travel times would be higher
         and the speeds lower. We request clarification of the entire footnote.

          Response: The report will include a revised and clarified footnote that provides a better explanation.

     12. Page 21, second paragraph from the bottom: Same comment about the upstream signals as
         in comment #6 (page 16).

     13. Page 21, last paragraph: The report should include the capacity analysis of the No-Build alternative
         (i.e. 4-Lane Bridge section) for the future ultimate year until when the No- Build alternative would
         operate with an acceptable LOS.

          Response: Table 4 (page 19) shows that the future condition with 2030 volumes and the existing
          geometry is expected to operate at LOS E. However, similar to the situation discussed in earlier
          comment responses and in the report, the full traffic demand volume does not make it into the model
          network in this alternative. We are taking another look at this alternative to ensure accurate results,
          and if possible, to determine when the density may realistically be anticipated to degrade to LOS F, if
          it is indeed expected to occur prior to 2030 with the existing lane configuration.

     14. Appendix: The VISSIM output and other relevant files (i.e. O-D matrix worksheet and volume-
         density-speed files for both existing and future year alternatives) should be included in the appendix
         of the report.

          Response: The additional files will be included in the report appendix.


Charleston County Comments (Richard L. Turner, P.E.):
Review comments were sent via email on July 26, 2011.

     1. Did the models account for signal timing changes to offset the platoons dispersing from the signals?
        What affect does this have on the efficiency of the SC-171 leg of these three intersections?

          Response: See the response to LPA comment #10.

     2. Need to show the unit for density on Table 1.

          Response: The report will be revised to show the unit for density (vehicles/mile/lane)

     3. Was consideration given to merging the Folly Road traffic to one lane prior to Albemarle Road? How
        much would that affect the efficiency of the intersection? If possible, then that would allow shared
        use path to follow Albemarle Road to the intersection without having to cross the marsh with a
        boardwalk. Cost savings and less permitting?

          Response: Yes, consideration was given to moving the Folly Road merge location to a point prior to
          the signal at Albemarle Road. However, this was quickly removed from consideration due to the
          large volume of traffic on the northbound Folly Road approach, both in the existing and projected
          future conditions. The typical base saturation flow rate for a signalized intersection is 1,900 vehicles
          per hour, assuming ideal conditions and 100% green time. However, because Folly Road typically
          receives approximately 55% of the green time per signal cycle (based on actuated results), the
          northbound Folly Road approach could only be expected to process at most about 1,045 vehicles per
          hour with a single lane. Today the volume on the northbound approach exceeds 1,400 during the
          AM peak hour, and by 2030 is expected to grow to nearly 1,900 vehicles per hour. As such, it is
          clear that the northbound approach needs two lanes at the signal in order to accommodate the

Rick,

We are ok with these responses. We will need to have the revised report by this Friday as I had noted
below. Thanks.

Rick, 
 
After reviewing the latest comments, we have some further quick responses (see below).  If we need to, 
we can formalize the responses, or discuss via phone with the County. 
 
Comment 1: We have not included the US 17 link to the south/west of Wesley Drive where the right 
turn lane was added in the computation of the simulation results (density, volume, speed, travel time).  
As such, we don't need to exclude the outside lane as suggested. 
 




                                                  G-5
Comment 10/12: The value of including the signal timing recommendation in the report is that hopefully 
its feasibility will be evaluated during the next signal retiming project in this area.  We can qualify the 
recommendation with this language, i.e., that it is recommended that the next signal retiming project in 
the West Ashley area involving the intersections along Wesley Drive and Folly Road evaluate the 
feasibility of modifying the offsets to spread the platoons entering the lane merge area on US 17 prior to 
the bridge. 
 
Comment 13: There was an issue with the results for the 2030 No Build run as included in the report.  
The model has been rerun and is now showing that most of the demand volume is being processed.  
The 2030 LOS is F, so we will interpolate to provide the anticipated breakpoint for E/F operations, as was 
done for the Recommended Alternative.

Rick, 
 
We accept all of the HDR responses except the following: 
 
Comment 1: We acknowledge the fact that the VISSIM model was modified and widened US 17 
eastbound link was coded to load more traffic demand at the entry link. We agree that the modification 
was done outside the actual study area and therefore would not have any significant impact into the 
study area results. . The recommendation we have is: "If this entry link result is shown in the report then 
it should include only the middle and inside lane information, not the outside lane." 
      
Comment 10 and 12: Since it is not known whether or not this strategy of spreading arrivals is feasible, 
why should it be included in the report? 
 
Comment 13: The original LPA comment is interpreted incorrectly. We acknowledge the fact that 2030 
NoBuild results were shown in Table 4, but we did not ask for that. We wanted to know how many 
years do we have in future (maybe 2025, 2026 or ???) until when the operating condition of 4lane 
Bridge section would deteriorate from LOS D to LOS E? Besides, the HDR response also includes that full 
traffic demand volume does not make it into the model. We recommend using a similar approach as 
described in HDR response 1 (i.e. increase the entry link capacity) to accomplish this task. 

We will need to have the revised report delivered no later than this Friday.

Richard,

Please see attached responses from HDR to our ARB Traffic Study comments. After reviewing their
responses, we can discuss next week.

Rick/Adrian,

Please find attached comments from our review of the study. Below are comments from the County. The
city has no comments at this time. Please coordinate responses to these comments through Gaynelle.
 Let her know if you have any questions and how soon you can provide responses and an updated study.
 I believe that the study will be submitted to the DOT for consideration once these comments are
addressed. Thanks.

Peter

Peter,

Below are my comments on the Ashley River Bridge Traffic Study.

    1. Did the models account for signal timing changes to offset the platoons dispersing from the
       signals? What affect does this have on the efficiency of the SC-171 leg of these three
       intersections?
    2. Need to show the unit for density on Table 1.
    3. Was consideration given to merging the Folly Road traffic to one lane prior to Albemarle Road?
       How much would that affect the efficiency of the intersection? If possible, then that would allow
       shared use path to follow Albemarle Road to the intersection without having to cross the marsh
       with a boardwalk. Cost savings and less permitting? .

Thanks,

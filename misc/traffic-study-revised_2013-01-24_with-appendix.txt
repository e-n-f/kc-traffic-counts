Executive Summary 
This Traffic Impact & Access Study has been prepared 
to evaluate the potential impacts associated with the 
proposed development project at 70 Prospect Street 
in Somerville, Massachusetts.  The proposed 
development project calls for the construction of a 
fivestory building with 14 residential condominium 
units and approximately 1,300 SF of retail space.  The 
project site is not currently vacant, and houses a car 
& truck rental facility.  The existing building will be 
demolished, and a new curb cut on Prospect Street 
will replace three existing curb cuts, two located on 
Webster Avenue and one on Prospect Street. 
This study includes a review of the existing traffic and roadway conditions in the vicinity of the 
project site, as well as a review of the accident history at each study intersection.  This study 
identifies background growth for the local roadway network, estimates the additional vehicular 
traffic generated the proposed development project, and evaluates the expected future 
roadway and intersection operations, both with and without the proposed development project 
in place. 

Summary of Results 
        Based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) methodology, the proposed 
        development project is expected to generate six new vehiclestrips during the weekday 
        morning peak hour, and nine new vehicletrips during the weekday afternoon peak 
        hour. 
        The project site is well served by existing public transportation services, and will be even 
        better served in the future with the Green Line extension project bringing transit service 
        to Union Square. 
        The existing crash rate at each study intersection is below the MassDOT District 4 and 
        statewide averages. 
        The proposed driveway on Prospect Street is better located, relative to the existing curb 
        cut location along Prospect Street. 
        Drivers exiting the proposed site drive onto Prospect Street are expected to have 
        sufficient sight distance for safe vehicle operations. 
        The intersection capacity analyses conducted at each study intersection indicate that 
        the projectgenerated traffic is not expected to have any significant impacts on the 
        intersection and roadway operations. 
This study indicates that the existing roadway network can accommodate the additional 
vehicular traffic generated by the proposed development project.  The number of additional 
vehicletrips is expected to be very low, and it is anticipated that the traffic impacts on the local 
roadway network will not be significant.

1. Introduction 
Design Consultants, Inc. (DCI) has prepared this traffic impact and access study to evaluate the 
potential impacts on the local transportation network associated with the proposed 
development project at 70 Prospect Street in Somerville.  DG Realty & Development is proposing 
to construct a fivestory building with 14 residential condominium units and approximately 
1,300 SF of retail space.  The proposed development project will replace the existing building 
and land use, which currently houses a car and truck rental facility.  This study includes a review 
of the existing traffic and roadway conditions in the vicinity of the project site, identifies 
background traffic growth for the study area, estimates additional traffic generated by the 
proposed development project, and evaluates the future traffic operations at the proposed site 
driveway and at the nearby study intersection. 


2. Existing Conditions 

Project Site 
The existing land use at the project site is a car and truck rental facility.  The site is served by 
three existing curb cuts, two along Webster Avenue and one along Prospect Street.  The existing 
curb cut on Prospect Street is located at the stop line for vehicles traveling northbound on 
Prospect Street.  This curb cut is infrequently used, and has a gate that can be opened to 
provide access to and from the site.  One curb cut on Webster Avenue is located approximately 
25 feet from the crosswalk across the southeastern leg of Webster Avenue, and the second 
curb cut is approximately 100 feet further south along Webster Avenue. 

Study Area 
A field inventory of the adjacent roadway system was conducted in December 2012.  This 
inventory included a collection of existing roadway geometry, traffic control, and traffic volumes 
for the intersections in the vicinity of the project site. 
The following study intersections are included in this report: 

        Prospect Street / Webster Avenue / Concord Avenue 
        Prospect Street / Newton Street 
        Prospect Street / Somerville Avenue 
A plan of the existing study area and its relation to the surrounding roadway system is shown on 
Figure 1.  The following is a description of the study area roadways and intersections within the 
study area.

Prospect Street 
Prospect Street is an urban arterial 
that runs northsouth from the 
Cambridge city line to Somerville 
Avenue to Washington Street.  
Prospect Street continues south 
through Cambridge and provides 
access to the larger transportation 
network, such Soldier's Field Road 
and the Massachusetts Turnpike 
(I90).  The proposed project at 70 
Prospect Street is located at the 
Prospect Street / Webster Avenue 
intersection, approximately two 
tenths of a mile north of the 
Cambridge city line.  There is no 
posted speed limit on Prospect Street in the area of the project.  Prospect Street generally 
provides a single travel lane in each direction, with "sharrow" bicycle pavements.  Onstreet is 
permitted on the east side of the roadway, and sidewalks are provided on both sides of the 
roadway.  The onstreet parking is residentonly permit parking, except on Sundays and 
holidays.  The existing land use on Prospect Street is a mix of residential and commercial uses. 
Prospect Street / Webster Avenue / Concord Avenue 
The Prospect Street / Webster Avenue / Concord Avenue intersection is a fivelegged signalized 
intersection.  To the south of this intersection, Prospect Street is a twoway roadway.  To the 
north of this intersection, Prospect Street is a oneway roadway in the northbound direction 
(away from this intersection).  Similarly, to the southeast of this intersection, Webster Avenue 
is a twoway roadway, while on the northwest side, Webster Avenue is a oneway roadway in 
the southeast direction (towards this intersection).  As such, Prospect Street and Webster 
Avenue function as a "oneway pair" that allows vehicles to travel to and from Union Square.  
Concord Avenue is a oneway residential roadway in the westbound direction (away from this 
intersection), and is 26 feet wide.  Onstreet parking is permitted on both side of Concord 
Avenue.  The Prospect Street northbound approach provides a single 12foot wide travel lane, 
and an adjacent 8foot wide parking lane.  The Webster Avenue northwest bound approach 
provides a single 16foot wide travel lane, with a striped 2foot wide shoulder.  The Webster 
Avenue southeast bound approach is 34 feet wide, and provides a 14foot wide shared 
through/rightturn lane, a 15foot wide leftturn lane, and 2foot wide shoulders on both sides 
of the roadway.  The left turning movement from Webster Avenue southeast bound to 
Prospect Street northbound is separated by a channelizing island, and is under YIELD control.  
Sidewalks are located on both sides of all the roadways at this intersection.  Pedestrian 
crosswalks are provided across both legs of Webster Avenue, across the south leg of Prospect 
Street, and across Concord Avenue.  Pedestrians have an exclusive pedestrian phase (activated 

                                                                                   January 2013
 
                                                                   Traffic Impact & Access Study       4
 
with a push button) to safely cross at any of these crosswalks.  There is a bus stop located on the 
northeast side of the Webster Avenue northbound approach, which currently serves MBTA bus 
route 85. 
Prospect Street / Newton Street 
Newton Street intersects Prospect Street at an acute angle approximately 180 feet south of the 
Prospect Street / Somerville Avenue intersection.  Prospect Street is a oneway roadway in the 
northbound direction.  The Prospect Street northbound approach is approximately 36 feet wide 
and provides three travel lanes.  Newton Street is a oneway roadway in the northeast direction 
and is under STOP sign control.  The Newton Street northeast bound approach is approximately 
20 feet wide and provides a single travel lane.  Onstreet parking is permitted on the southeast 
side of Newton Street, though parking is prohibited for a distance of approximately 135 feet 
back from the Newton Street stop line.  Six foot wide sidewalks are provided on both side of 
Prospect Street, and a 4foot wide sidewalk is provided along the northwest side of Newton 
Street.  A crosswalk is provided across Newton Street. 
Prospect Street / Somerville Avenue 
This four legged signalized intersection is located at the eastern end of the Union Square area.  
The Prospect Street northbound 
approach is a oneway roadway, 
with vehicles traveling 
northbound.  All other roadway 
approaches at this intersection 
are twoway roadways.  The 
Prospect Street northbound 
approach provides three 12foot 
wide travel lanes: an exclusive 
leftturn lane, a shared left
turn/through lane, and a shared 
through/rightturn lane.  A 1foot 
wide striped shoulder is provided 
on both sides of the Prospect 
Street northbound approach.  
The Prospect Street southbound 
approach consists of two 12foot wide rightturn only lanes, with "sharrow" bicycle pavement 
markings in the rightmost travel lane.  A channelizing median island prevents vehicles on the 
Prospect Street southbound approach from turning left at this intersection.  The Somerville 
Avenue eastbound approach provides a shared leftturn/through lane and a second through 
lane.  There is a short median island to separate the eastbound and westbound traffic on 
Somerville Avenue.  At the intersection, each eastbound lane is 13feet wide with a 1foot wide 
shoulder on each side.  There are also "sharrow" bicycle pavement markings on the Somerville 
Avenue eastbound approach.  The Somerville Avenue westbound approach consists of a through 
lane and a shared through/rightturn lane, both 13feet wide.  The shared through/rightturn 
lane is only provided for a distance of approximately 90feet back from the stop line.  Further to 

                                                                                    January 2013

the east, Somerville Avenue provides a single westbound travel lane and striped bicycle lane.  
On the south leg of Prospect Street there are 6foot wide sidewalks on both sides of the 
roadway, on the north leg of Prospect Street there is a 10foot wide sidewalk on the east side of 
the roadway and a 9foot wide sidewalk on the west side of the roadway.  On the east leg of 
Somerville Avenue, there is an 8foot wide sidewalk on the north side of the roadway and a 13
foot wide sidewalk on the south side of the roadway.  On the west leg of Somerville Avenue 
there is a 9foot wide sidewalk on the south side of the roadway and a sidewalk that varies from 
6 to 10feet wide on the north side of the roadway.  There are crosswalks across each leg of the 
intersection, controlled by an exclusive pedestrian phase.  There is a bus stop located on the 
Prospect Street northbound approach to this intersection, which currently serves MBTA bus 
routes 91 and CT2. 


2. Traffic Volumes 
An Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) was used to record roadway traffic volumes on Prospect 
Street during a 48hour period on Wednesday December 12 ­ Thursday December 13, 2012.  
These counts were not adjusted for seasonal variation as December volumes are indicative or 
slightly higher than average annual conditions, based on the most recent seasonal adjustment 
factors from MassDOT.  In addition to vehicle volumes, the ATRs also collected vehicle speeds 
and vehicle classification data.  The 85th percentile speed is the defined as the speed at or below 
which 85% of the vehicles are traveling.  The ATR data are summarized in Table 1, below.

In addition to the ATR data, manual turning movement counts (including vehicles, bicycles and 
pedestrians) were collected at the study intersections during the AM peak period (79am) and 
the PM peak period (46pm).  These hours typically represent the peak time periods for 
commuter traffic.  The TMC data were collected on Thursday, December 13, 2012.  The existing 
morning and afternoon peak hour traffic volumes at each study intersection are displayed on 
Figure 2.  The complete traffic count data are provided in Appendix A.

3. Public Transportation 
The following identifies current Bus Routes in the immediate vicinity of the project site. 

        MBTA Route 85 ­ connecting Spring Hill to Kendall/MIT in Cambridge via Union Square.  
        This route travels along Webster Avenue adjacent to the project site, and along Prospect 
        Street north of the project site.  Service is generally provided every 3040 minutes 
        during the weekday peak periods, although no service is provided on weekends. 
        MBTA Route CT2 ­ connecting Sullivan Square and Ruggles Station via Union Square, 
        Kendall/MIT in Cambridge, and the Longwood Medical Area.  This route travels along 
        Webster Avenue adjacent to the project site, and along Prospect Street north of the 
        project site.  Service is generally provided every 20 minutes during the weekday 
        morning peak period, and every 25 minutes during the weekday afternoon peak period.  
        No service is currently provided on weekends. 
Detailed route schedules and maps for the above two MBTA bus routes are provided in 
Appendix B.  In addition to the two bus routes identified above, the project site is in close 
proximity to Union Square (less than a quartermile walk), and to Inman Square in Cambridge 
(less than a halfmile walk).  These two local transportation hubs provide access to many more 
MBTA bus routes, including: 

        MBTA Route 86 ­ Sullivan Square Station (Charlestown) to Cleveland Circle (Brighton) 
        MBTA Route 87 ­ Arlington Center (Arlington) to Lechmere Station (Cambridge) 
        MBTA Route 91 ­ Sullivan Square Station (Charlestown) to Central Square (Cambridge) 
        MBTA Route 69 ­ Harvard Square (Cambridge) to Lechmere Station (Cambridge) 
        MBTA Route 83 ­ Rindge Avenue (Cambridge) to Central Square (Cambridge) 

All of these routes terminate or intersect with a major multimodal hub such as Sullivan Station 
(Orange Line), Lechmere Station (Green Line), Harvard Square (Red Line), Central Square (Red 
Line), or Cleveland Circle (Green Line).  With access to these major multimodal transportation 
centers, many options exist for accessing the project site via public transportation. 


4. Safety Analysis 
To identify vehicle crash trends at the study intersections, accident data was obtained from the 
MassDOT for the three latest years on record, 2008 ­ 2010.  Crash rates for intersections are 
calculated based upon the number of crashes at an intersection and the volume of traffic 
travelling through an intersection on a daily basis.  The MassDOT average crash rates are based 
upon the average number of crashes occurring per million vehicles entering signalized and 
unsignalized intersections.  The average crash rates for MassDOT District 4 (which includes the 
City of Somerville) are 0.78 and 0.59 for signalized and unsignalized intersections, respectively.  
The MassDOT statewide average crash rates are 0.81 and 0.61 for signalized and unsignalized 
intersections, respectively.  The crash data for all study intersections are summarized in Table 2. 


                                                                                    January 2013

As indicated in Table 2, the crash rate at each study intersection is below the MassDOT District 4 
average and below the statewide average crash rate, based on accident data from MassDOT. 
In addition to the crash data from MassDOT, the City of Somerville Police Department was 
contacted and accident data for the 3year period from 2010 ­ 2012 were obtained.  The local 
accident records were sought as more recent data are available.  While the accident data from 
the City of Somerville contained a higher number of crashes at the Prospect Street / Somerville 
Avenue intersection (relative to the MassDOT accident data), there were no accidents reported 
for the intersections of Prospect Street / Webster Avenue and Prospect Street / Newton Street 
in the data from the City of Somerville Police Department.  For those two intersections, the 
accident data from MassDOT must be relied upon, as no other data are available.  Table 3 
summarizes the crash data from the City of Somerville at the Prospect Street / Somerville 
Avenue intersection.

As indicated in Table 3, the higher number of crashes reported in the local crash data at the 
Prospect Street / Somerville Avenue intersection result in a crash rate that is higher than the 
MassDOT District 4 average crash rate for signalized intersections.  This is likely caused by the 
high volume of traffic, multiple turning lanes, and several private driveways (i.e. Dunkin' Donuts) 
in close proximity to the intersection.  The proposed development project at the corner of 
Prospect Street / Webster Avenue is not expected to exacerbate any existing safety issues at the 
intersection Prospect Street / Somerville Avenue. 
The MassDOT intersection crash rate worksheets and the complete accident data from the City 
of Somerville are provided in Appendix C.

While the crash rate at the Prospect Street / Webster Avenue intersection is well below the 
MassDOT average rate, particular attention has been given to this location due to the proximity 
of the subject site and the complex and irregular intersection geometry.  Over the three year 
period that was analyzed, there were six crashes that were angle type crashes, sideswipe type 
crashes, or headon collisions.  The aerial image graphic below is meant to illustrate concerning 
vehicular conflict points that occur at this intersection.  There is a significant volume of traffic 
coming from the north on Webster Avenue, particularly in the weekday morning peak hour, 
with approximately 40% of the vehicles turning right onto Prospect Street southbound and 60% 
continuing on Webster Avenue.  These movements conflict with vehicles coming from the south 
on Webster Avenue turning onto Concord Avenue and Prospect Street.  It is likely that the large 
turning radii and complex geometry contribute to these types of crashes. 




                                                                        Existing Curb Cut 




                                                                                     Proposed Curb Cut




                                                                                                               

Also shown on the aerial image are the locations of the existing curb cut on Prospect Street that 
serves the project site (shown in red) and the approximate location of the proposed curb cut 
(shown in green).  The proposed curb cut is located approximately 75 feet further from the 
intersection than the existing curb cut, and is further removed from any of the conflict points at 
the intersection of Prospect Street and Webster Avenue.  As such, the proposed driveway 
location is expected to be an improvement relative to the existing curb cut location on Prospect 
Street.

6. Future Conditions 

Future Traffic Volumes 
DCI understands that traffic volumes and circulation patterns in and around the Union Square 
area are expected to change dramatically in the relatively near future.  The proposed extension 
of the MBTA Green Line light rail service and the proposed Union Square station will increase 
access to public transportation significantly.  In anticipation of the proposed Green Line 
extension project, the City of Somerville has recently changed the zoning in the Union Square 
area.  Significant commercial development is also expected within the study area.  Furthermore, 
significant changes to the roadway network have been discussed, including changes that would 
make all sections of Prospect Street and Webster Avenue twoway roadways.  However, a 
comprehensive study of the effects of these changes is beyond the scope of this traffic impact 
and access study.  This study focuses on the incremental impacts associated with this relatively 
minor development project. 
To present a relatively conservative analysis of future year 2017 (5 year projection), DCI has 
increased the 2012 peak hour motor vehicle volumes by an annual growth factor of 1%.  This 
background growth rate is consistent with other traffic studies previously completed in 
Somerville.  It is assumed that the existing roadway network and travel patterns remain in all 
future conditions.  The resultant 2017 Future NoBuild peak hour intersection volumes are 
shown in Figure 3. 

ProjectGenerated VehicleTrips 
To estimate the trip generation characteristics of the proposed development project, the 
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (9th edition, 2012) was used.  
This manual provides vehicletrip generation projections for various landuses, based on 
research and data conducted by public agencies, developers, consulting firms, and professional 
associations.  The trips generated by the proposed project were estimated through the use of 
the trip generation rates for ITE Land Use 230 ­ Residential Condominium/Townhouse and ITE 
Land use 826 ­ Specialty Retail Center. 
Table 4 summarizes the proposed trip generation for this development project.  Complete trip 
generation calculations are provided in Appendix D.

As indicated in Table 4, the proposed development project is expected to generate a total of 6 
vehicletrips during the weekday morning peak hour, 9 vehicletrips during the weekday 
afternoon peak hour, and 124 vehicletrips over the course of a typical weekday.  These vehicle
trip projections include a 10% reduction, based on the close proximity to existing and proposed 
public transportation.  As discussed previously, this area is currently well served by MBTA bus 
routes.  Additionally, the Union Square station that is proposed as part of the Green Line 
Extension will be in very close proximity to the proposed development project.  In all likelihood, 
the proportion of trips using public transportation to travel to and from the project site will be 
significantly higher than 10%. 
Further adjustments to the trip generation calculations that were not included in the 
quantitative analysis include passby trips and internal sitetrips.  Passby trips are vehicletrips 
to and from the project site that are made by vehicles already using the roadway.  It is likely that 
some portion of the trips to and from the retail space will be made by people who already drive 
on Prospect Street or Webster Avenue already, and are not new trips to the roadway network.  
Internal site trips are those made within the project site, and do not add any external trips to 
the surrounding transportation network.  An example of an internal trip is someone who lives in 
the building and walks to the retail space on the project site.  Credits for passby trips and 
internal site trips were not taken because trip generation adjustments are often difficult to 
accurately quantify for very small development projects, such as the one being proposed here. 
As reductions were not taken for passby trips nor for internal site trips, and only a 10% 
reduction was taken for public transportation, the trip generation calculations provide for a 
conservative analysis.  It is also noted that the vehicletrips expected to be generated from the 
project site are lower than the recorded daily variation of vehicles on Prospect Street. 
Lastly, no credit was taken for the existing vehicle trips traveling to and from car and truck rental 
facility that is currently located on the project site.  As such, many of the "new" trips generated 
by the proposed development project will simply be replacing existing vehicletrips that are 
already using the local roadway network.  No credit was taken for the trips traveling to and from 
the existing site because the ITE Trip Generation Manual does not contain data for car & truck 
rental facilities, and traffic counts at the existing driveways were not conducted due to the very 
small size of the proposed development project.  Anecdotally, approximately 2 to 5 vehicletrips 
can be expected from the existing car & truck rental facility during the weekday peak periods.  
These trips would be subtracted from the estimated trips generated by the proposed 
development project to arrive at the net number of new trips on the local roadway network.  
However, as trips associated with the proposed project site are so low already, this credit was 
not taken. 
The projectgenerated vehicle trips, shown in Table 4, were then distributed onto the roadway 
network, using existing travel patterns.  The trip distribution use to apply the new vehicletrips 
to the roadway network is displayed in Figure 4.  The new sitegenerated vehicle trips are 
displayed in Figure 5, and the 2017 Future Build Peak Hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 
6.

Sight Distance Analysis 
The sight distance was measured at the proposed driveway on Prospect Street in order to 
determine whether exiting vehicles would have adequate sight distance.  The required sight 
distance is a function of perception/reaction time of the approaching motorist and the required 
braking distance, which is based on vehicular speed.  The available sight distance at the 
proposed driveway was recorded in conformance with the procedures established in the 
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) A Policy on 
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (6th ed., 2011).  The available sight distance was then 
compared to the minimum requirements for two sight distance criteria: Stopping Sight Distance 
(SSD) and Intersection Sight Distance (ISD). 
SSD is the distance required for vehicles on the major road to stop in time to avoid a collision 
with a stationary object.  The SSD was recorded from the edge of the travel way on Prospect 
Street.  This is the point at which an object becomes an obstruction to a moving vehicle.  ISD is 
the distance needed for a vehicle to enter the major roadway from the minor roadway without 
interfering with traffic operations on the major roadway.  ISD is often desirable to improve 
traffic operations and to provide convenience for vehicles exiting the minor roadway, but it is 
not required.  In accordance with the procedure stated in the AASHTO A Policy on Geometric 
Design of Highways and Streets, the ISD was recorded 15 feet back from the edge of the travel 
way on Prospect Street.  This point forms one vertex of the "clear sight triangle".  The sight 
triangle is the area that must be clear from obstructions to provide sufficient ISD for a stopped 
driver on a minor road approach to depart from the intersection and enter the major roadway. 
The recorded 85th percentile speed of 26 MPH was used to determine the minimum sight 
distance requirements for northbound vehicles.  In the southbound direction, the recorded 85th 
percentile speed was 32 MPH.  However, the ATR location, between Concord Avenue and Oak 
Street is to the south of the proposed driveway.  Based on the existing intersection control and 
geometry at the Prospect Street / Webster Avenue intersection, many vehicles are accelerating 
as they travel southbound away from the signalized intersection.  As such, the majority of 
vehicles are travelling slower than 32 MPH as they approach the proposed driveway from the 
north.  Based on these characteristics, a travel speed of 30 MPH was used to determine the 
minimum sight distance requirements for southbound vehicles at the proposed site driveway. 
The proposed site plan is shown in Figure 7.  This figure shows the location of the proposed 
driveway. 
Table 5 compares the available sight distance at the proposed site driveway location, as 
recorded in the field, to the minimum requirements for SSD and ISD.

As shown in Table 5, the minimum sight distance requirements for SSD are exceeded in both 
directions, and the ISD looking to the south also exceeds the minimum desirable distance.  The 
intersection sight distance looking to the north is not expected to be an issue, as gaps in the 
traffic flow will be created by the traffic signal at the Prospect Street / Webster Avenue 
intersection. 
The results of this sight distance analysis also confirm the finding, discussed earlier in this report, 
that the proposed location of the driveway along Prospect Street is expected to have positive 
safety effects, particularly when compared to the location of the existing driveway along 
Prospect Street. 
 

Parking 
A total of 14 offstreet parking spaces are being provided at the project site, one for each of the 
residential condominium units.  Ten of these spaces will be located in a garage under the 
proposed building, and four spaces will be located outdoors.  One of the four outdoor onsite 
parking spaces will be a shared parking space, and will be signed to allow customers of the retail 
portion of the project site to park between the hours of 9:00am and 5:00pm on weekdays.  
However, if customers of the retail portion arrive when the shared parking space is not available 
(either in the early morning period, late afternoon/evening, or on weekends), there is sufficient 
available onstreet parking in the immediate vicinity of the project site. 
As noted earlier in this report, onstreet parking is provided on the northeast side of Webster 
Avenue.  These onstreet parking spaces are limited to 2hours between 8:00am and 6:00pm, 
except on Sundays, holidays, and by residential parking permit (in which case vehicles are not 
limited to 2hours).  There are currently six existing parking spaces in this area within 200 ft of 
the project site (north of Columbia Street).  Observations were made during the weekday peak 
hours and during the Saturday midday peak hour to determine the utilization of the existing 
parking spaces, to see if they would be available for users of the retail portion of the proposed 
development project.  The parking observations are summarized in Table 6.

As indicated in Table 6, of the six onstreet spaces that are within 200 ft of the project site and 
not restricted with residential parking permits, there were always two or more available spaces 
with the exception of a single 15minute period, during which there was just one available 
parking space.  Based on these onstreet parking observations, it is clear that there is sufficient 
onstreet parking in the vicinity of the project site to support the retail portion of the proposed 
development project when the shared onsite parking space is not available. 

Intersection Capacity Analysis 
To assess quality of traffic flow, intersection capacity analyses were conducted for the study 
intersections for existing conditions and future conditions with and without the proposed 
development project.  Capacity analyses determines LevelofService (LOS) based upon vehicle 
delays for intersection operating conditions. 
LevelofService is used to denote the different operating conditions for roadways and 
intersections under various traffic volume loads.  LOS designations range from "A" at best with 
little or no delays to "F" at worst with long delays and forced flow conditions.  LOS ratings for an 
intersection are based upon the average delay per approaching vehicle.  The amount of delay is 
dependent upon traffic volumes, roadway characteristics, intersection geometry, and phasing 
and timing of traffic signals.  A LOS ranking of "C" is considered stable flow which is desirable for 
peak design flows in urban areas.  A LOS "D" is considered acceptable during peak periods in 
urban areas. 
Definitions of Levels of Service at signalized and unsignalized intersections are presented in the 
2010 Highway Capacity Manual and the following tables define the relationship between Level 
of Service, control delay, and qualitative traffic flow.  It is noted that the delay thresholds in the 
table below correspond with a volumetocapacity (v/c) ratio of less than 1.0.  For any v/c ratio 
of greater than 1.0, a LOS F is assigned, regardless of the calculated delay.

The delay thresholds that define LOS at unsignalized intersections differ from those at signalized 
intersections, primarily due to different driver expectations.  At unsignalized intersections, the 
LOS is not defined for the intersection as a whole, as a high volume of vehicles on the major 
roadway typically experience no delay, and would heavily skew any weighted average of delays.  
Similar to the thresholds for signalized intersections, the delay thresholds in the table below 
correspond with a volumetocapacity (v/c) ratio of less than 1.0.  For any v/c ratio of greater 
than 1.0, a LOS F is assigned, regardless of the calculated delay

A detailed traffic network for the two peak travel periods was developed to perform the 
capacity analyses, which utilized the Synchro v8 software.  A Level of Service analysis was done 
for the existing 2012 and future 2017 "Build" and "No Build" conditions for the study 
intersections.  A summary of the Level of Service (LOS) is shown in Tables 9 and 10 for the 
existing 2012 and future 2017 scenarios for the weekday AM and PM peak hour conditions, 
respectively.  The detailed capacity analysis worksheets are contained in Appendix E.

As indicated in Tables 9 and 10, the intersection of Prospect Street / Webster Avenue currently 
operated at an overall LOS F, while the intersection of Prospect Street / Somerville Avenue 
currently operates at an overall LOS E.  These two signalized intersections are expected to 
continue to operate at the same overall LOS in the 2017 Future NoBuild scenario.  The very low 
number of additional vehicletrips added to the roadway network from the project site is not 
expected to have any significant impacts on the traffic operations with respect to vehicle delay 
and queuing. 
It is also noted that the existing signal controllers at the intersections of Prospect Street / 
Webster Avenue and Prospect Street / Somerville Avenue are currently operating in "pretimed" 
mode.  This is either due to nonexistent or nonfunctioning vehicle detection on all intersection 
approaches.  The City of Somerville could significantly improve traffic operations by upgrading 
and/or fixing the existing traffic signal equipment and optimizing traffic signal timings. 
At the unsignalized intersection of Prospect Street / Newton Street, the Newton Street approach 
currently operates at LOS B during both the weekday morning and afternoon peak hours.  It is 
expected to continue to operate at LOS B during all future scenarios. 
At the Prospect Street / Site Driveway intersection, vehicles exiting the project site are 
anticipated to operate at LOS B during both the weekday morning and afternoon peak hours, 
with minimal onsite queuing.  While the Prospect Street northbound queue from the 
intersection with Webster Avenue is expected to extend past the project site driveway during 
both peak hours, the impact to vehicles on Prospect Street southbound stuck behind vehicles 
waiting to turn left into the project site is minimal, due to the very low volume of vehicles 
turning left into the project site (as shown on Figure 5, not more than 3 vehicles during each 
weekday peak hour are expected to turn left from Prospect Street into the project site). 
 


7. Conclusion 
The various traffic operation and safety analyses that have been included in this report all 
indicate that the proposed development project at 70 Prospect Street will have minimal impacts 
to the surrounding roadways and intersections.  The location of the proposed driveway on 
Prospect Street will have safety benefits relative to the location of the existing curb cut location 
on Prospect Street.  The number of additional vehicletrips that will be generated at the project 
site are very low, and can easily be accommodated by the existing transportation infrastructure.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

PURPOSE AND NEED

The purpose of this project is to evaluate traffic operations along the LA 23 corridor in
Plaquemines Parish just north of Port Sulphur, LA. This 3.8 mile stretch of highway is
currently a two lane highway between 4-lane sections. This study will review existing and
projected traffic conditions, define existing and anticipated problem areas, and offer
potential solutions to alleviate anticipated problem areas. There are no major intersections in
this section, and River Road runs parallel to the highway to the east along the Mississippi
River levee for most of the length of this study area.

LA 23 at Venice, LA is the southern terminus of the "Great River Road", a collection of
roads generally with tourism designations that run primarily along the Mississippi River
through ten states and at least one Canadian Province.

Access and mobility have always been concerns for industry and the travelling public. Growth
was consistent prior to the landfall of Hurricane Katrina. While the aftermath has interrupted
the growth, the residential population is expected to completely return, and the oil and fishing
industries are expected to expand in the coming years. LA 23 is the only access to the industry
facilities in Port Sulphur and Venice.

 If left unimproved existing problems can be expected to increase due to the continued
recovery from Katrina and as local industry continues to rebuild. It is also important to
enhance the overall plan to provide roadway network continuity, sufficient roadway access,
mobility, and capacity improvements to meet future traffic demand. Roadway safety must be a
priority. This is also the Official Evacuation Route for Plaquemines Parish.


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In order to accommodate the anticipated growth in traffic volumes in this corridor, the
following four alternatives were explored:

   1.   Take No Action
   2.   Widen LA 23 to four lane with complete reconstruction
   3.   Widen LA 23 to four lane, using as much of the existing pavement as possible
   4.   Improve River Road and operate as a couplet.

Of the four alternatives explored, we are recommending Alternative #3; Upgrade of the
roadway to UA-2 (Urban Arterial) using as much of the existing pavement as possible. This
alternative would meet the present and future needs required of the roadway, and involve
the lowest construction costs, due to the reuse of existing pavement. An estimate of
construction cost is supplied below in Table E-1.

I. INTRODUCTION
      This report describes the study of roadway capacity and operation of the LA 23
      corridor in the Port Sulphur area, land uses and possible solutions for certain
      transportation issues of the corridor. LA 23, known as the Belle Chasse Highway,
      traverses the extent of the west bank of the Mississippi River. It is a multi-lane divided
      highway that connects the Westbank Expressway in Jefferson Parish with Venice, LA.
      Widening of this stretch of roadway is currently in the state Regional Planning
      Commission's Metropolitan Transportation Plan.

     The objectives of this study are as follows:
    · To assess the traffic impacts associated with the proposed geometric modifications
      and identify the level of off-site access and traffic control improvements required to
      service the project corridor land uses
    · To provide public agencies with a comprehensive study which evaluates and
      documents traffic impacts and improvements, where warranted;
    · To provide a technically sound basis to identify impacts and related mitigation
      requirements.

      In order to define traffic impact, this analysis determines the extent of existing traffic
      conditions and projects changes in traffic flow due to operation of the proposed
      facility.

III. LAND USE
       A HIGHWAY CORRIDOR
           As described in Plaquemines Parish Land Use and Transportation Vision Plan, the
           predominant land use from south of the LA 23 bridge is classified as Rural
           Residential. This is essentially the Planning District #5 (Central Plaquemines) in
           this plan. Along this corridor, land is classified as Industrial, commercial and
           agricultural. Existing and future land use maps from this document are shown
           below in Figures 2 and 3.

           Central Plaquemines is 3619 acres in size and largely made up of residential land
           uses. The 2000 Census indicated a population of 2065 residents which was 7% of
           the total population of Plaquemines Parish.

           As is indicated in the figures below, some changes from Industrial to
           Institutional/Governmental uses can be expected. For example, the new Port
           Sulphur Community Center is currently under construction at the south end of the
           study area, near South Plaquemines High School.

           This area is close to where Hurricane Katrina made landfall, and of course, the
           district experienced some flooding during the hurricanes of 2005. Within the levee
           protection system, the flood zone type is AE, with base flood elevation of 12 ft.
           district-wide.

IV. EXISTING TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM CONDITIONS
  As indicated, the study area transportation system identified for investigation includes a 3.8
  mile section of LA 23 between Port Sulphur and Happy Jack.

  LA 23 is functionally classified as a rural minor arterial type roadway with a posted speed
  limit of 45 mph. It is currently an undivided two lane roadway with approximately 6 foot
  shoulders.

  The proximity of residences to an industrial corridor such as we have here does raise safety
  concerns, and these should be considered in the decisions regarding roadway upgrades.

  A survey indicates that there is roughly 100' of available Right-of-Way along the roadway.

  The roadway is intersected at numerous locations by short, residential local streets. There are
  no intersections that can qualify as `major', and therefore no intersections were analyzed.
  There is a natural gas compressor station near the north end of the project area, and a
  grocery store a little to the south, and some small retail toward the south end.

  River Road is a local road that runs parallel to the studied stretch of roadway. This road is
  very lightly travelled, and runs along the base of the Mississippi River levee. There are a
  number of residences along this roadway, and several local roads connect River Road and
  LA 23.

V. EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
      A.     PEAK INTERVALS FOR ANALYSIS
           The peak periods selected for analysis are normally considered weekday AM, Noon
           and PM peak periods. For the purposes of this report, there were no intersections
           considered major enough to justify capacity analysis.

      B.     EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUME DATA
           Weekday AM and PM peak traffic counts were obtained by Krebs, LaSalle,
           LeMieux Consultants at either end of the study area where River Road intersects
           LA 23 highway.

      C. AVERAGE DAILY TRAFFIC
           24 Hour count data was collected by Krebs, LaSalle, LeMieux Consultants on LA
           23 between Sunday, November 29 and Saturday, December 5, 2009. Counts were
           taken at the north and south end of the studied section of roadway.
           Table I below illustrates the data collected.

      D.     CRASH DATA
           A review of crash data supplied by LADOTD for the years of 2006-2008 on
           stretch of roadway under study was performed. Crash data is broken down by
           conditions, type, number of vehicles involved, time of day, location, etc. There
           appears to be no overriding pattern of crash happenings on this section of
           roadway, beyond the expected incidents caused by turns to and from a highway
           into residential areas, i.e. rear end collisions, right angle collisions, etc. No single
           location stands out.

         Field Observations in Study Area

       The study area was observed during the AM and PM peak interval to assess current
       traffic operations. Traffic volumes are fairly modest, (See Table I) side street traffic
       was very light, and no significant safety or congestion issues were noted.

VI. FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

  The Future Land Use Plan indicates little difference in planned land uses, therefore future
  volumes were projected at 2% annual growth up to the year 2029. As development
  continues and population grows over the next 20 years, geometric improvements may be
  required to accommodate the increased volumes.

  TABLE II below gives the projected 24 hour volumes that can be anticipated, using
  representative values on LA 23 shown above in TABLE I.

  Discussion

         Although it is unlikely that traffic will exceed the capacity of the roadway anytime
         soon, in order to maintain continuity of the roadway and flow of traffic, it is
         appropriate to widen this 3.8 mile stretch. Adequate right of way is available to
         accommodate this.

         LA 23 is the main roadway in Plaquemines Parish. There are a number of industries
         along the corridor, many of which employ heavy industrial trucks. This section of
         highway is located between two four-lane sections.

         The already predominant oil and fishing industries can expect significant growth in
         the future, especially with new offshore oil leases being developed. The Port Sulphur
         area is situated such that it is an attractive location to increase capacity for transport
         product. There are port facilities in place for both of these industries. Damage was
         significant from Hurricane Katrina, but reconstruction can be reasonably anticipated.

         As traffic volumes are expected to increase over time, it would be logical to upgrade
         this length of highway to four lanes for continuity of the roadway.

         This roadway is also the only Evacuation Route for all points south in Plaquemines
         Parish.




                                                  12                                     April 2010

VII. POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS

  According to the survey performed by the consultant team, the existing ROW of LA 23 in
  this section of the roadway is 100 ft. The DOTD Standard for Rural Highway would suggest
  a requirement of 140' feet of ROW to provide for a divided highway with a median. This
  would require the purchase of an additional 40' of right of way. The purchase of this land
  would significantly increase the time and money necessary to upgrade this stretch of
  roadway. This would be designing it to adequately sustain a 65mph speed limit.

  If, however, the roadway is built to UA-2 or Urban Highway Standards, 100' of Right of
  Way is sufficient to put four lanes into the existing Right of Way, with a Design Speed of 50
  mph. The adjacent stretch of highway immediately to the south into Port Sulphur is
  currently built to four lanes, with no median.

  Four alternatives for upgrade of the studied roadway were considered.

      Alternative One

      ·   The first alternative would be to take no action

      Alternative Two

      ·   The second alternative would be to widen the existing roadway to four lanes within
          the existing Right-of-Way to Urban Highway Standards. This alternative would entail
          complete reconstruction of the roadway, with completely new pavement. Figure 6
          shows a Typical Section, Figures 7 and 8 show a Plan View Layout of this
          alternative.

      Alternative Three

      ·   The third alternative would be to widen the existing roadway to four lanes within the
          existing Right-of-Way to Rural Highway Standards and reuse as much of the existing
          pavement as possible. Figure 9 shows a Typical Section, Figures 10 and 11 show a
          Plan View Layout of this alternative.

      Alternative Four

      ·   The fourth alternative would be to upgrade the existing roadway to accommodate
          two lanes of southbound traffic, and to upgrade the River Road to accommodate
          two lanes of northbound direction, in effect creating a "couplet" stretch of roadway.
          This would require the upgrade of the River Road pavement to State Highway
          standards. The existing highway pavement would be reused as much as possible.
          Figure 12 shows a Typical Section, Figures 13 and 14 show a Plan View Layout of
          this alternative.

Discussion

Alternative one is technically feasible if funds for the project cannot be found.

This section of roadway is sandwiched between two sections of four lane roadway. For
continuity of roadway purposes, and since this is part of the evacuation route, it would be
appropriate to upgrade this stretch of roadway if possible.

Estimated construction costs are illustrated in the tables located in the Conclusion and
Recommendations sections.

Functionally, Alternatives 2 and 3 are identical, with the difference being construction
requirements for all new materials as to reusing as much as possible.

The fourth alternative should ultimately prove to be the most expensive, due to the
requirements of upgrading River Road, and such costs are included in the construction
estimate. An environmental assessment would have to be performed; the River Road
roadbed would have to be completely redesigned and constructed to state highway design
standards, in addition to bringing the pavement up to design standards. Also, River Road is
so close to the Mississippi River levee, construction would have to take the levee into
account.

Operationally, there would be little difference in any of the three modifications of the
existing roadway. So based on the cost of Right of Way, construction and implementations costs, it is the
opinion of our team that Alternative Three would be the most cost effective solution.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

   In order to accommodate the anticipated growth in traffic volumes in this corridor, the
   following four alternatives were explored:

      1.   Take No Action
      2.   Widen LA 23 to four lane with complete reconstruction
      3.   Widen LA 23 to four lane, using as much of the existing pavement as possible
      4.   Improve River Road and operate as a couplet.

   Of the four alternatives explored, we are recommending Alternative #3; Upgrade of the
   roadway to UA-2 (Urban Arterial) using as much of the existing pavement as possible. This
   alternative would meet the present and future needs required of the roadway, and involve
   the lowest construction costs, due to the reuse of existing pavement. An estimate of
   construction cost is supplied below in Table III.

        Krebs LaSalle Environmental, LLC (KLE), conducted a Stage 0 Environmental Study to
locate significant features along and adjacent to Louisiana State Highway 23 as designated in
Chapter 4: Stage 0 Standard Operating Procedure of the "DOTD Program Development and
Project Delivery System Manual" on January 13, 2010. The target area extends from Happy
Jack, LA (P.O.B. Lat. 29°31'19.49672"N, Long. 89°44'01.43496"W), to Port Sulphur, LA
(P.O.E. Lat. 29°28'40.0901"N, Long. 89°41'29.72609"W). Starting and ending coordinates
were provided by Krebs, LaSalle, LeMieux Consultants, Inc. (KLL). A Stage 0 Environmental
Checklist, plat showing the project corridor and photographs of the area are attached.
Adjacent Land Use
         Land along the Hwy. 23 corridor between the towns of Happy Jack and Port Sulphur is
enclosed by major flood/river levees with a mix of undeveloped, residential, commercial and
industrial (including oil and gas processing facilities) properties adjacent to the roadway. The
majority of the property appears to be privately owned though there are a number of publicly
owned facilities including a governmental building, a fire station, sheriff's substation, schools
and a post office adjacent to or in the vicinity of the project area. There are several
commercial/industrial facilities of various sizes located along the corridor. The largest of these
facilities belongs to Tennessee Gas Pipeline, which is a processor of natural gas. There are no
properties along the study corridor that are enrolled in the Wetland Reserve Program. It is
unknown if any Native American tribal lands are in the area. Inquiry was made of the
Department of Culture, Recreation and Toursism, Division of Archeology, but no response was
received at the time the report was prepared. Note that the addresses referenced in the report and
in the checklist were obtained from mailboxes in front of the facility/item of interest or from the
database search undertaken by GeoSearch where possible. Where this information was not
available, Google Earth was used to obtain an approximate address.
Community Elements
        Community elements that may possibly be impacted along the project corridor were
recorded. It should be noted that the area is currently rebuilding following damages caused by
Hurricane Katrina in 2005. New schools, a community center, churches (Greater Mount Sinai
Baptist Church, an unidentified new church, Port Sulphur Baptist Church), businesses, etc. are
being constructed to replace facilities that were destroyed by the storm. Underground water and
gas lines run within the right-of-way and underground and overhead electric lines run within and
adjacent to the right-of-way. The South Plaquemines High School, South Plaquemines Parish
Elementary School and Solid Rock Academy were identified as being adjacent to or near the
Hwy. 23 right-of-way. Also, the Port Sulphur Volunteer Fire Department and a Plaquemines
Parish Sheriff's Office substation are located adjacent (less than 0.1 miles) to the site. No formal
parks or recreation areas are located within the corridor.

Section 4(f) issues
       No public recreation areas, wildlife refuges, or historic sites were found along the Hwy
23 corridor in question. One "park" (Prea Park) was identified on the USGS quad map for the
area (Port Sulphur; 29089-D6-TF-024). However, no signs or other evidence of the use of the
area as a public facility could be found. When inquiry was made, the Parish officials could
provide no information about the park, its ownership, its use or its funding. With consideration
of these factors, KLE has classified it as an informal recreational area. As, according to KLL,
the proposed roadway widening will be limited to the existing 100 foot right of way, it does not
appear that the informal recreational area property will be impacted by the project.
National Register of Historic Places
        There are eight locations listed on the National Register of Historic Places within
Plaquemines Parish. After extensive review of available maps, site information provided on the
National Register of Historic Places website and the Louisiana Department of Culture,
Recreation       and      Tourism,       Division  of     Historic     Preservation      website
(http://www.crt.state.la.us/hp/?) KLE determined that none of these locations were located along
or directly adjacent to the target corridor.
Threatened or endangered species in the area
      The Louisiana Natural Heritage Program maintains a database of rare, threatened or
endangered plant and animal species that may occur in Louisiana. Their website:
            http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/pdfs/experience/naturalheritage/plaquemines.pdf
identifies five species which may occur in Plaquemine Parish which are considered to be
threatened or endangered at the state and/or federal level. These species are shown in Table 1
below.
 Scientific Name            Common Name            State Rank    State Status            Federal

        A cursory field inspection did not reveal any of these species, nor appropriate habitats for
most, in the proposed project right of way. Wintering presence of the Peregrine falcon, however,
cannot be dismissed.

Louisiana Scenic Rivers Act
       According to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, administrator of the
Louisiana Scenic Rivers Act, there are no rivers in the Louisiana Scenic Stream System located
in Plaquemines Parish.
Significant Trees as defined by EDSM I.1.1.21 within ROW
        The survey provided to KLE by KLL located several trees within the right-of-way that
might be deemed "significant", as defined by EDSM I.1.1.21. The EDSM definition includes any
live oaks, red oaks, white oaks, magnolias, or cypress that are either aesthetically important,
greater than 18" DBH (diameter breast height ­ 4.5 feet above the ground), or historic. A
number of oak trees with a DBH greater than 18" were observed immediately along the
powerlines adjacent to Hwy. 23. Significant and potentially significant trees are listed in Table
2, below, and are indicated on the concerns plat. During subsequent environmental review and
road design, appropriate steps will be taken to preserve the existing treeline to the maximum
extent practicable.

Significant Bridges
       Neither a review of aerial photography nor the field inspection found any bridges located
along the section of roadway proposed to be upgraded.
Hazardous Materials
        State and federal databases were researched by GeoSearch and a field survey was
performed by KLE to determine if hazardous materials are present along or adjacent to the
project corridor. The area was severely impacted during Hurricane Katrina. Numerous homes
and businesses were severely damaged or destroyed. Destroyed filling stations may still have
underground storage tanks located onsite and debris from destroyed homes and businesses may
have ended up in any of the several ponds and/or the soils located adjacent to the roadway.
Since soils and waters testing is not a part of this assessment, KLE is unable to determine if the
soils and/or waters directly adjacent to the roadway are contaminated by storm debris. The
addresses listed below were provided by GeoSearch.
          Leaking underground storage tanks (LUST)
                 Two leaking underground storage tanks were identified in the GeoSearch Radius
          Report. They are as follows:
                    La Caffe Casa, Inc., 26145 Hwy 23, Port Sulphur, LA 70083
                    Tennessee Gas Pipeline, 26166 Hwy 23, Port Sulphur, LA 70083
          CERCLIS
                 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
          Information System (CERCLIS), which is maintained by the Environmental Protection
          Agency (EPA) did not list any active or archived sites along the project area.
          ERNS
                  The Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS) is maintained by the
          National Response Center (NPC). NPC's primary function is to serve as the sole national
          point of contact for reporting all oil, chemical, radiological, biological, and etiological
          discharges into the environment anywhere in the United States and its territories.
          GeoSearch performed a records search of the NPC's ERNS database and located a total
          of seventeen records. Of these seventeen records, only six had sufficient documentation
          to be locatable. All of the records are briefly described below:

          Enforcement and compliance history
                  A records search of numerous databases is performed as part of GeoSearch's
          Radius Report. These databases cover, among others, the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water
          Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Emergency Planning and
          Community Right-to-Know Act ­ Section 13; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the
          Federal Compensation and Liability Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; the Marine
          Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act; and the Permit Compliance System. Based on
          the Radius Report, the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Facility has had at least two instances of
          enforcement actions reported under the Permit Compliance System on the dates of
          08/29/2005 and 09/23/2005. No other facilities were reported as being subject to
          enforcement actions.
          Underground storage tanks (UST)
                  A records search of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality's UST
          database is part of GeoSearch's Radius Report. The Radius Report identifies five USTs in
          the vicinity of the site corridor. They are listed as follows:
                    La Caffe Casa Inc. 26145 Hwy 23, Port Sulphur, LA 70083
                    Tennessee Gas Pipeline 26166 Hwy 23, Port Sulphur, LA 70083
                    Delta Drugs Inc. 26852 Hwy 23, Port Sulphur, LA 70083
                    Southern Natural Gas-Port Sulphur Subdistrict Hwy 23, Port Sulphur, LA 70083
                    Tony's Gulf Hwy 23, Port Sulphur, LA 70083
                Two destroyed/abandoned gas stations were also located which might still have
          USTs present:
                    A site across the street from "Happyland #2" convenience store located at 27910
                    Hwy 23 (see photo 9).
                    A site adjacent to the roadway (see photo 15).
          Chemical plants, refineries, or landfills
                  During the database and aerial photograph search, two sites within the general
          area of the project were noted that appear to be chemical or refinery facilities. The
          largest and closest of these is an oil and natural gas processing plant (Tennessee Gas
          Pipeline) which is located immediately adjacent to Hwy. 23. According to the U. S.
          Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service website
                  (http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/offshore/egom/independence_hub.html)



Page 30
U.S. Hwy. 23 Widening
Environmental Inventory


          this facility is connected via pipeline to the off-shore "Independence Hub". The peak
          daily production levels of the "Independence Hub" are 850 million cubic feet of gas and
          4,250 barrels of condensate. Much of this gas and condensate is routed to the Tennessee
          Gas Pipeline, Port Sulphur processing plant.
                    Sundown Energy operates a tank battery to the west of corridor.
                  No landfills immediately adjacent to the project site were noted in the GeoSearch
          report nor were any observed during the review of aerial photographs or the field
          inspection.
                 Twelve waste pits were found in GeoSearch's database review. All twelve of
          these waste pits are located within a 0.25-mile radius of the site. None, however, appear
          to be in or adjacent to the area of interest. Of the twelve waste pits found, three are
          operated by Hilcorp Energy Company and nine are operated by Aran Energy
          Corporation. For details on these waste pits, refer to the GeoSearch Radius Report.
          Large manufacturing facilities
                  Other than the Tennessee Gas Pipeline facility discussed above, no large
          industrial or manufacturing facilities were identified in or adjacent to the area of interest.
          Entergy does have a substation (the "Happy Jack Substation") located adjacent to Hwy.
          23 just south of the Tennessee Gas Pipeline facility.
          Dry cleaners
                 The GeoSearch Radius Report identified no dry cleaners along the study corridor
          nor were any dry cleaners noted during the field inspection.
Oil/Gas wells
       GeoSearch's Oil and Gas Report identified fifty seven oil and gas wells located within a
0.5-mile radius of the site corridor. None appear to be in or immediately adjacent to the project
corridor. The closest, the "Mrs. Perciual D Lange et al" well, appears to be approximately 285'
from the centerline of Hwy. 23. See the enclosed GeoSearch report for further details on the
located oil and gas wells.
Residential or commercial relocations/displacements
        According to KLL, no residential or commercial relocations or displacements will be
necessary for the proposed highway improvements. Field inspection found that several
businesses have infrastructure that appears to be immediately adjacent to or to have encroached
into the right-of-way. These include gas pumps (Happyland #2; see photo 8), oil and gas/utility
infrastructure (Atmos facility; see Photo 16), part of a building undergoing reconstruction
(unidentified business; see Photo 20) and part of a small cemetery (see photos 6 and 7).

Sensitive community issues
          There were no sensitive community issues discovered during this survey.
Project area population
       The population along the target area appears to represent a broad variety of
demographics; therefore, the proposed project should not create disproportionately high and
adverse human health and environmental effects on minority or low income populations.
       According to information from U.S. Census, in 2000 the Port Sulphur CDP had a
population of approximately 3,115 people (note that the census predated Hurricane Katrina
[2005]). The population at that time was 45.3% White, 44.4% Black and 7% American Indian.
Housing units were 85.1% owner-occupied and 14.9% renter-occupied. In 1999, the per capita
income was $13,553 with a median household income of $30,187 and a median family income
of $33,021. Approximately 20.5% of families and 22.2% of individuals lived below the poverty
level.
Detour/closure types
       According to KLL, temporary lane closures should be the only type of detour or road
closure activities needed during construction of the highway expansion.
Windshield survey results
        The project area was severely impacted by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Extensive building
damage is visible with some storm debris still littering the area. Because of the nature and scope
of the Katrina flooding, KLE cannot determine how debris and contaminants might have been
distributed within the project corridor.

THIS COMPLAINT IS LINKED TO INCIDENT#:T-67078. INSPECTOR SPOKE WITH MR. HARRIAGAN ON 1/14/04. INSPECTOR INFORMED
COMPLAINANT THAT TENNESSEE GAS DID INDEED REPORT THIS INCIDENT AND ARE ALLOWED BY THIER PERMIT TO PERFORM
MAINTENANCE, WHICH INCLUDES BLOWDOWNS. WHEN I SPOKE WITH MR. RAE DONALDSON HE INFORMED ME THAT EVERY FEW
MONTHS THE FACILITY DOES SHUTDOWN PIPES TO PERFORM MAINTENANCE, IN WHICH THEY HAVE TO BLOWDOWN THE SYSTEM AND
THIS PROCESS IS VERY, VERY LOUD SINCE THE GAS IS UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE. I RELATED THIS TO MR. HARRIGAN AND I ALSO
INFORMED HIM THAT WE INVESTIGATE EACH INCIDENT AND IF AN INCIDENT WAS FOUND TO BE FROM OPERATOR ERROR OR
NEGLIGENCE WE WOULD SEND THIS TO OUR ENFORCEMENT DIVISION.
INSPECTOR IS STILL WAITING FOR INFORMATION FROM TENNESSEE GAS PIPELINE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF INCIDENT# 67078.

                       FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY REPORT


FEMA - Federal Emergency Management Agency
    The information used in this report is derived from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The Q3 Flood Data is
    developed by electronically scanning the current effective map panels of existing paper Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). Certain
    key features are digitally captured and then converted into area features, such as floodplain boundaries. Q3 Flood Data captures
    certain key features from the existing paper FIRMs, including:
    - 100-year and 500-year (1% and 0.2% annual chance) floodplain areas, including Zone V areas,
     certain floodway areas (when present on the FIRM), and zone designations
    - Coastal Barrier Resources Act (COBRA) areas
    - FIRM panel areas, including panel number and suffix


    This data was last updated between 1996 and 2000 and is available in select counties throughout the United States.




FEMA Flood Zone Definitions Relevant to Map

A                          Zone A

NWI - National Wetlands Inventory
   The US NWI digital data bundle is a set of records of wetlands location and classification as defined by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.
   This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5 minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric coordinates of wetlands point,
   line, and area features and wetlands attributes. When completed, the series will provide coverage for all of the contiguous United
   States, Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. protectorates in the Pacific and Caribbean. The digital data as well as the hardcopy maps that were
   used as the source for the digital data are produced and distributed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory
   project. Currently, this data is only available in select counties throughout the United States.

AIRSAFS            Aerometric Information Retrieval System / Air Facility Subsystem
VERSION DATE:    3/2009

     The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) modified the Aerometric Information
     Retrieval System (AIRS) to a database that exclusively tracks the compliance of stationary sources
     of air pollution with EPA regulations: the Air Facility Subsystem (AFS). Since this change in 2001,
     the management of the AIRS/AFS database was assigned to EPA's Office of Enforcement and
     Compliance Assurance.


BF                 Brownfields Management System
VERSION DATE:    7/2009

     Brownfields are real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be
     complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or
     contaminant. Cleaning up and reinvesting in these properties takes development pressures off of
     undeveloped, open land, and both improves and protects the environment. The United States
     Environmental Protection Agency maintains the activities, including grantee assessment, cleanup
     and redevelopment, of the various Brownfield grant programs through the Brownfields
     Management System database.


BRS                Biennial Reporting System
VERSION DATE:    1/2003

     The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in cooperation with the States,
     biennially collects information regarding the generation, management, and final disposition of
     hazardous wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA),
     as amended. The purpose of this report is to communicate the findings of EPA's Biennial Reporting
     System (BRS) data collection efforts to the public, government agencies, and the regulated
     community.
     Currently, the EPA states that data collected between 1991 and 1997 was originally a part of the
     defunct Biennial Reporting System and is now incorporated into the RCRAInfo data system.


CDL                Clandestine Drug Laboratory Locations
VERSION DATE:    3/2009

     The U.S. Department of Justice ("the Department") provides this information as a public service. It
     contains addresses of some locations where law enforcement agencies reported they found
     chemicals or other items that indicated the presence of either clandestine drug laboratories or
     dumpsites. In most cases, the source of the entries is not the Department, and the Department
     has not verified the entry and does not guarantee its accuracy. Members of the public must verify
     the accuracy of all entries by, for example, contacting local law enforcement and local health
     departments. The Department does not establish, implement, enforce, or certify compliance with
     clean-up or remediation standards for contaminated sites; the public should contact a state or local
     health department or environmental protection agency for that information.

VERSION DATE:   8/2009

   The USGS National Water Information System includes water-resources data for approximately 1.5
   million sites across the United States from 1857 to present. The USGS investigates the
   occurrence, quantity, quality, distribution, and movement of surface and underground waters and
   disseminates the data to the public, State and local governments, public and private utilities, and
   other Federal agencies involved with managing our water resources.

VERSION DATE:   3/2009

   This Statewide Water Well Registration Data File is maintained by the Louisiana Department of
   Transportation and Development (DOTD) along with the Louisiana District of the United States
   Geological Survey. It should be noted that the list does not include every possible water well,
   which may have been drilled under a given name or within the requested sections. The list
   represents only those wells that have been registered with DOTD, including those scheduled by the
   U.S. Geological Survey, and does not include those which are presently being processed. It should
   also be noted that the owner s name or other well data might not be current if the well has changed
   ownership, use, ect. since it was first registered. Additionally, the Department cannot guarantee the
   accuracy of the data since they were collected from many different sources, with varying degrees
   of accuracy.

RE: CITY DIRECTORY SEARCH

Dear Mr. Munchausen,

GeoSearch conducted a city directory search for Hwy. 23 in Port Sulphur, LA. There
were no directories available for the city of Port Sulphur or Plaquemines Parish, while
directories for New Orleans did not have coverage for the area. Research was conducted
at the Texas State Library and Archives Commission, as well as the Library of Congress.
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call at (512) 472-9966.


Sincerely,




Justin Clinger

This study addresses the traffic impacts associated with the proposed development of land
located south of Warm Springs Road in Ketchum, Idaho. The proposed development,
composed of a resort hotel, residential units, and other supporting amenities, is located near
Bald Mountain Road, Four Seasons Lane, Flower Drive, and Townhouse Lane.

Included within the analyses for this study are the traffic operations for existing conditions and
plus project conditions (conditions after development of the proposed project) at key
intersections and roadways in the vicinity of the site. Future 2018 conditions were also
analyzed.

TRAFFIC ANALYSIS

The following is an outline of the traffic analysis performed by Hales Engineering for the
respective traffic conditions of this project.

   Existing (2012) Background Conditions Analysis

   Hales Engineering performed weekday afternoon (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) peak period traffic
   counts at the following intersection(s):
       Bald Mountain Road / Warm Springs Road
       Four Seasons Lane / Warm Springs Road
       Flower Drive / Warm Springs Road
       Townhouse Lane / Warm Springs Road
       Saddle Road / Warm Springs Road
       Lewis Street / Warm Springs Road

   These counts were performed on Wednesday, February 13, 2008. Due to the current
   economic circumstances, minimal amounts of development have occurred during the last
   several years in this vicinity of Ketchum, therefore, it was decided that the traffic volumes
   have not changed significantly and that the previous traffic counts would be sufficient for this
   updated evaluation. The p.m. peak hour was determined to be between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m.
   Based on the combination of 2008 intersection volumes and traffic generated by the site, the
   weekday p.m. peak hour was the critical time identified for analysis. Detailed count data is
   included in Appendix A.

   As shown in Table ES-1, all study intersections experience acceptable levels of delay.

      Project Conditions Analysis

      The proposed land use for the site has been identified as follows:
          Hotel Suites:                                       122 keys
          Residences:                                         33 units
          Creekside Villas                                    37 units
          Golf Villas                                         24 units
          Ranch Homes                                         13 units
          Food and Beverage Area                              10,800 square feet
          Meeting Space                                       12,200 square feet
          Spa / Wellness Center                               16,200 square feet
          Short Game Golf Course                              9 holes

      The projected gross trip generation for the development is as follows:
          Daily Trips:                                       2,079 vehicles per day (vpd)
          a.m. Peak Hour Trips:                              150 vehicles per hour (vph)
          p.m. Peak Hour Trips:                              184 vph
          Saturday Daily Trips:                              2,511 vpd
          Saturday Peak Hour Trips:                          261 vph
       
      The Hotel Suites and Residences were melded into an occupied unit count for the hotel and
      were computed as a "worst case" scenario. Although not necessarily in accordance with ITE,
      Hales Engineering used the greater Key number, thus generating a much more conservative
      evaluation.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The following mitigation measures are recommended:

     Existing (2012) Background Conditions Analysis

     Based on a specific study of the Lewis Street / Warm Springs Road intersection for the City
     of Ketchum, Hales Engineering has recommended that a modified roundabout be installed
     at this and the neighboring 10th Street / Warm Springs Road intersection. However, if right-
     of-way can't be acquired at this location, it is recommended that a traffic signal be installed
     to help traffic flow better at this location. All analyses were completed using the traffic signal
     as a default traffic control device because it also creates a "worst case" scenario for LOS
     calculations, e.g., the roundabout will offer a better LOS for these closely spaced
     intersections.

     No additional mitigations are recommended.

   Existing (2012) Plus Project Conditions Analysis

   No mitigation measures are recommended.

   Future (2018) Background Conditions Analysis

   No mitigation measures are recommended.

   Future (2018) Plus Project Conditions Analysis

   No mitigations are recommended.

   The Saddle Road intersection is too close to the Lewis Street intersection to be signalized;
   however, if the Lewis Street and 10th Street intersections are changes into roundabouts,
   consideration should be given to creating a roundabout at the Saddle Road intersection as
   well.

   If the intersection were to remain with its current form or intersection control, on average,
   vehicles will incur more delay waiting to make the southbound left turn movement with the
   project traffic added to the future 2018 traffic. Additionally, the 95th percentile queue length
   for that movement will be between 125 and 145 feet (or 6 to 7 vehicles). The nearest access
   along Saddle Road is approximately 290-feet north of the intersection and will not be
   impacted by this long queue during most times of the day.


SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS/RECOMMENDATIONS

The following is a summary of key findings and recommendations:
    All study intersections currently (2012) have acceptable levels of service.
    The proposed project is a mix of housing types including resort hotel with residences,
        villas, and ranch homes and includes amenities such as restaurants, meeting space, spa
        and a short game golf course.
    With project traffic added to the roadway network (2012), all intersections operate at
        acceptable levels of service.
    Future traffic volumes (2018) are based on a comprehensive land use evaluation
        completed collaboratively between the development Team and Ketchum City planning
        staff.
    Most intersections operate at acceptable levels of service during future (2018)
        conditions, and future conditions with project traffic added, with the exception of the
        Saddle Road intersection which has an LOS F movement for southbound left turning

A.     Purpose

This study addresses the traffic impacts associated with the proposed development of land
located south of Warm Springs Road in Ketchum, Idaho. The proposed development,
composed of a resort hotel, residential units, and other supporting amenities, is located near
Bald Mountain Road, Four Seasons Lane, Flower Drive, and Townhouse Lane.

Included within the analyses for this study are the traffic operations for existing conditions and
plus project conditions (conditions after development of the proposed project) at key
intersections and roadways in the vicinity of the site. Future 2018 conditions were also
analyzed.

B.     Scope

The study area was defined based on conversations with the development Team and Ketchum
City staff members. This study was scoped to evaluate the traffic operational performance
impacts of the project on the following intersections:
     Bald Mountain Road / Warm Springs Road
     Four Seasons Lane / Warm Springs Road
     Flower Drive / Warm Springs Road
     Townhouse Lane / Warm Springs Road
     Saddle Road / Warm Springs Road
     Lewis Street / Warm Springs Road

C.     Analysis Methodology

Level of service (LOS) is a term that describes the operating performance of an intersection or
roadway. LOS is measured quantitatively and reported on a scale from A to F, with A
representing the best performance and F the worst. Table 1 provides a brief description of each
LOS letter designation and an accompanying average delay per vehicle for both signalized and
unsignalized intersections.

The Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (HCM 2010) methodology was used in this study to remain
consistent with "state-of-the-practice" professional standards. This methodology has different
quantitative evaluations for signalized and unsignalized intersections. For signalized and all-way
stop intersections, the LOS is provided for the overall intersection (weighted average of all
approach delays). For all other unsignalized intersections LOS is reported based on the worst
approach. Hales Engineering has also calculated overall delay values for unsignalized
intersections, which provides additional information and represents the overall intersection
conditions rather than just the worst approach.

D.     Level of Service Standards

For the purposes of this study, a minimum overall intersection performance for each of the study
intersections was set at LOS D. However, if LOS E or F conditions exist, an explanation and/or
mitigation measures will be presented. An LOS D threshold is consistent with "state-of-the-
practice" traffic engineering principles for urbanized areas.

               II. EXISTING (2012) BACKGROUND CONDITIONS

A.     Purpose

The purpose of the existing (2012) background analysis is to study the intersections and
roadways during the peak travel periods of the day with background traffic and geometric
conditions. Through this analysis, background traffic operational deficiencies can be identified
and potential mitigation measures recommended. This analysis will provide a baseline condition
that may be compared to the build conditions to identify the impacts of the development.

B.     Roadway System

The primary roadways that will provide access to the project site are described below:

Warm Springs Road ­ is a city-maintained collector street that provides direct ingress and
egress access to the proposed site. The right-of-way for Warm Springs Road is approximately
50-feet wide. This roadway is currently composed of a two-lane cross section with one travel
lane in each direction as well as an eight-foot wide multi-use trail on the north side of the road.
The speed limit on Warm Springs Road near Saddle Road is 20 mph while the speed limit to the
west in the canyon is 30 mph.

C.     Traffic Volumes
Hales Engineering performed weekday afternoon (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) peak period traffic counts
at the following intersection(s):
     Bald Mountain Road / Warm Springs Road
     Four Seasons Lane / Warm Springs Road
     Flower Drive / Warm Springs Road
     Townhouse Lane / Warm Springs Road
     Saddle Road / Warm Springs Road
     Lewis Street / Warm Springs Road

These counts were performed on Wednesday, February 13, 2008. Due to the current economic
circumstances, minimal amounts of development have occurred during the last several years in
this vicinity of Ketchum, therefore, it was decided that the traffic volumes have not changed
significantly and that the previous traffic counts would be sufficient for this updated evaluation.
The p.m. peak hour was determined to be between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. Based on the
combination of 2008 intersection volumes and traffic generated by the site, the weekday p.m.
peak hour was the critical time identified for analysis. Detailed count data is included in
Appendix A.

Figures 2a and 2b show the existing peak hour volumes as well as intersection geometry at the
study intersections for the p.m. peak hours.

D.     Level of Service Analysis

Using Synchro/SimTraffic, which follow the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010 methodology
introduced in Chapter I, and p.m. peak hour LOS was computed for each study intersection. The
results of this analysis are reported in Table 2 (see Appendix B for the detailed LOS reports).
Multiple runs (10) of SimTraffic were used to provide a statistical evaluation of the interaction
between the intersections. These results serve as a baseline condition for the impact analysis of
the proposed development during existing (2012) conditions. As shown in Table 2, all
intersections have acceptable levels of service during the p.m. peak hour.

E.     Queuing Analysis

Hales Engineering calculated the 95th percentile queue lengths for each of the study
intersections. The queue reports can be found in Appendix D. No significant queuing exists at
the study intersections during the p.m. peak hour.

F.     Mitigation Measures

Based on a specific study of the Lewis Street / Warm Springs Road intersection for the City of
Ketchum, Hales Engineering has recommended that a modified roundabout be installed at this
and the neighboring 10th Street / Warm Springs Road intersection. However, if right-of-way can't
be acquired at this location, it is recommended that a traffic signal be installed to help traffic flow
better at this location. All analyses were completed using the traffic signal as a default traffic
control device because it also creates a "worst case" scenario for LOS calculations, e.g., the
roundabout will offer a better LOS for these closely spaced intersections.

No additional mitigations are recommended.

A.      Purpose

The project conditions analysis explains the type and intensity of development. This section
provides the basis for trip generation, distribution, and assignment of project trips to the
surrounding study intersections defined in the Introduction.

B.      Project Description

This study addresses the traffic impacts associated with the proposed development of land
located south of Warm Springs Road in Ketchum, Idaho. The proposed development,
composed of a resort hotel, residential units, and other supporting amenities, is located near
Bald Mountain Road, Four Seasons Lane, Flower Drive, and Townhouse Lane.

A concept plan for the proposed development has been included in Appendix C.

The proposed land use for the site has been identified as follows:
    Hotel Suites:                                   122 keys
    Residences:                                     33 units
    Creekside Villas                                37 units
    Golf Villas                                     24 units
    Ranch Homes                                     13 units
    Food and Beverage Area                          10,800 square feet
    Meeting Space                                   12,200 square feet
    Spa / Wellness Center                           16,200 square feet
    Short Game Golf Course                          9 holes

C.      Trip Generation

Trip generation for the development was calculated using rates published in the ITE Trip
Generation (8th Edition, 2008). Trip Generation for the proposed project is included in Table 3.
The ITE trip generation rates identify gross trips to and from a facility as if it were a stand-alone
activity. Gross ITE trip generation rates do not account for internal capture or transit trips. Hales
Engineering evaluated the internal capture and transit nature of this site.
Some trip generation assumptions made are discussed as follows:

        Resort Hotel ­ Trip generation for the Resort Hotel was calculated using the ITE Land
        Use data for Resort Hotels (ITE Land Use Code 330). Part of ITE's description of a
        resort hotel includes the observation that resort hotels "cater to the tourist and vacation


Ketchum ­ Warm Springs Ranch Resort Traffic Impact Study                                          9
       industry, often providing a wide variety of recreational facilities/programs (golf courses,
       tennis courts, beach access, or other amenities)." Additionally, some of the properties
       surveyed included guest transportation services such as shuttles and/or limousine
       services. Trip generation for resort hotels is based on the number of occupied rooms.
       Based on conversations with city staff and the development team, a 70 percent
       occupancy rate was assumed.

       Villas ­ Trip generation for the Villas was completed by applying the regular townhouse
       trip generation rate (ITE Land Use Code 230) to estimate trips generated by the Villas.

       Meeting Space ­ Currently, there is no national data available from ITE for meeting
       space as a land use. Trip generation was estimated based on information from the
       previous proposal for this site and the new square footages. From Team experience, it
       was estimated that 50 percent of attendees would be lodging on-site and utilizing time-
       of-day parking variation like an office land-use, which was assumed to have similar
       loading and un-loading characteristics as a convention center.

The ITE trip generation rates identify gross trips to and from a facility as if it were a stand-alone
activity. Gross ITE trip generation rates do not account for trips already on adjacent roadways or
for internal capture. Hales Engineering did not adjust the gross trip generation to account for
pass-by trips due to the destination nature of this project; however, trips were adjusted to
account for some internal capture due to the mixed use characteristics of the proposed project.

The following internal capture assumptions were made:

       Quality Restaurant ­ Based on conversations with the development team, it was
       determined that 75 percent of the patrons to the quality restaurant would be guests of
       the hotel. Therefore, trip generation for the restaurant was reduced by 75 percent.

       9-Hole Golf Course ­ Based on conversations with the development team, it was
       determined that 70 percent of the patrons to the 9-hole golf course would be guests of
       the hotel. Therefore, trip generation for the 9-hole golf course was reduced by 70
       percent.

       Meeting Space ­ Based on conversations with the development team, it was determined
       that 50 percent of the patrons to the meeting space would be guests of the hotel.
       Therefore, trip generation for the meeting space was reduced by 50 percent.

       Spa/Wellness Center ­ Based on conversations with the development team, it was
       determined that 50 percent of the patrons to the spa/wellness center would be guests of
       the hotel. Therefore, trip generation for the spa/wellness center was reduced by 50
       percent.

Additionally, some transit reductions were made including the following:
    Resort Hotel ­ 10 percent reduction for limo service providing transportation to and from
       the downtown area and various other destinations.

        Villas ­ 4 percent reduction. According to local census data, approximately 4 percent of
        residents in Ketchum use transit.

        Restaurants and Spa/Wellness Center ­ 4 percent reduction to account primarily for
        employees who use transit.


D.      Trip Distribution and Assignment

Project traffic is assigned to the roadway network based on the type of trip and the proximity of
project access points to major streets, high population densities, and regional trip attractions.
Existing travel patterns observed during data collection also provide helpful guidance to
establishing these distribution percentages, especially in close proximity to the site. The
resulting distribution of project generated trips is as follows:

To/From Project Site:
       5% West on Warm Springs Road
       95% East on Warm Springs Road

These trip distribution assumptions were used to assign the p.m. peak hour generated trips at
the study intersections to create a trip assignment for the proposed development. Trip
assignment for the p.m. peak hour is shown in Figures 3a and 3b.

E.      Access

The proposed access to the site will be gained from Warm Springs Road. Bald Mountain Road
will be realigned from its current location through the Warm Springs Ranch Resort and to Flower
Drive and connecting to Warm Springs Road. This realignment will take place for safety reasons
including the acute angle of Bald Mountain Road with Warm Springs Road in its current location
makes sight distance difficult, the approach angle makes visibility difficult and compounds the
poor sight distance issues, the roadway cross-slope needs to be corrected and the steepness of
Bald Mountain Road can be lowered to a more reasonable winter condition.

1.   Land Use Code from the Institute of Transportation Engineers - 8th Edition Trip Generation Manual (ITE Manual)
2.   Trip generation data was not available for this land use during this time period so an estimate was calculated based on the relationship between peak hour and daily volumes for a regular hotel (ITE Land Use Coded
3.   Trip generation for this land use was reduced by 75% because this resturaunt will primarly be used by guests on site.
4.   Trip generation for this land use was reduced by 70% because the golf course will primarly be used by guests on site.
5.   Trip Generation the meeting space was not availible from ITE, therefore, estimates were based on parking demand and time-of-day variance.
6.   Trip generation for this land use was reduced by 50% because the spa/wellness center will be used by resort guests and guests from off-site.

              IV. EXISTING (2012) PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS

A.     Purpose

This section of the report examines the traffic impacts of the proposed project at each of the
study intersections. The net trips generated by the proposed development were combined with
the existing background traffic volumes to create the existing plus project conditions. This
scenario provides valuable insight into the potential impacts of the proposed project on
background traffic conditions.

B.     Traffic Volumes

Project trips were assigned to the study intersections based on the trip distribution percentages
discussed in Chapter III and permitted intersection turning movements.

The existing (2012) plus project p.m. peak hour volumes were generated for the study
intersections and are shown in Figures 4a and 4b.

C.     Level of Service Analysis

Using Synchro/SimTraffic, which follow the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010 methodology
introduced in Chapter I, the p.m. peak hour LOS was computed for each study intersection. The
results of this analysis are reported in Table 4 (see Appendix B for the detailed LOS reports).
Multiple runs (10) of SimTraffic were used to provide a statistical evaluation of the interaction
between the intersections. As shown in Table 4, all of the study intersections experience
acceptable levels of delay during the p.m. peak hour.

D.     Queuing Analysis

Hales Engineering calculated the 95th percentile queue lengths for each of the study
intersections. The queue reports can be found in Appendix D. No significant queuing was
observed.

                V. FUTURE (2018) BACKGROUND CONDITIONS

A.     Purpose

The purpose of the future (2018) background analysis is to study the intersections and
roadways during the peak travel periods of the day for future background traffic and geometric
conditions. Through this analysis, future background traffic operational deficiencies can be
identified and potential mitigation measures recommended.

B.     Traffic Volumes

Traffic volumes for the future year 2018 were projected using estimates of anticipated growth in
the Warm Springs area. Future developments factored into this growth include residential
growth in the Warm Springs area, the development of the Board Ranch Homes, and the
redevelopment of the Warm Springs Base redevelopment.

Warm Springs Area:

According to data obtained from the City of Ketchum Land Capacity, by John Gaeddert, AICP
(1997), it was estimated that there was sufficient land remaining in the Warm Sprigs Area for an
additional 827 to 937 new homes. According to building permit data obtained from Ketchum,
321 new homes were built between 1997 and 2007, equating to approximately 32.1 new
dwelling units per year. However, based on conversations with Ketchum City staff, it was
assumed that only approximately 10 dwelling units per year would be built in the Warm Springs
Area. Therefore, it was assumed that 110 new dwelling units would be constructed by 2018.

According to research completed by Benchmark Associates, P.A., approximately 73 percent of
the homes in the Warm Springs area could be considered as secondary residential homes. To
remain conservative, Hales Engineering assumed 30 percent of new homes will be primary
homes while the remaining 70 percent will be secondary, or recreational, homes.

Although some new dwelling units will likely be multi-family units such as condominiums,
apartments, townhouses, etc., it was assumed that all new homes would be single-family
dwelling units. This estimate is conservative as single-family dwelling units typically generate
more daily trips than do multi-family type dwelling units.

Using data provided by Jason Miller, Executive Director of Mountain Rides, Hales Engineering
determined that in Ketchum, Idaho, approximately 8.5 percent of the workers use public
transportation in the winter to travel to and from work. In addition, the 2000 Census identified
that approximately 22 percent of workers used alternative means such as walking, biking, or
working at home. Therefore, a 30 percent reduction of commuting trips (estimated to be two per
primary single-family dwelling) was taken. Total new trips estimated for 2018 is 586 vehicles per
day.

Board Ranch Homes:

Based on conversations with Benchmark, it was determined that 10 additional homes would be
constructed by 2015 in the Board Ranch area as well as 3 additional homes between 2015 and
2018. Using the same methodology as was used for the Warm Springs Area, new trips were
estimated to be 77 vehicles per day for year 2018.

Warm Springs Base Redevelopment:

A proposed redevelopment of Warm Springs Base will add significant impact to Warm Springs
Road. The proposed redevelopment area includes 14.27 acres of which approximately 0.77
acres are right-of-way for Picabo Street. Additionally, one 120-room hotel is proposed that will
take approximately two acres of land. Another two acres of land is assumed to be held for future
development. The City of Ketchum estimates that 50 percent of the remaining 9.5 acres will be
developed by year 2018. The proposed development is vertical mixed-use with ground floor
retail and upper floor residential. The City of Ketchum estimated an overall floor to area ratio
(FAR) of 1.6; therefore, the overall square footage would be 331,100 square feet (4.75 acres x
1.6 x 43,560 square feet / acre = 331,100 total square feet). Assuming 10,000 square feet of
retail land use, the remaining 321,100 square feet would be residential land use. Assuming an
average condominium size of 2,000 square feet, 160 new condominiums would be included in
the development. It was assumed that half of the condominiums (80) would be developed by
2018.

In summary, it is estimated that the Warm Springs Base redevelopment would include the
following land use by 2018:
      Hotel                              120 Rooms
      Retail                             10,000 Square Feet
      Condominiums                       80 Units

Trip generation for the proposed redevelopment was calculated using trip generation rates
published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 8th Edition, 2008. It
was assumed that the hotel would have a 70 percent occupancy rate and that the gross
leasable area of the retail would be equal to 95 percent of the gross floor area (e.g., 10,000 x
95% = 9,500 square feet gross leasable area). As previously identified, it was assumed that 50
percent of the new condominiums will be primary homes and 50 percent will be secondary
homes.

The ITE trip generation rates identify gross trips to and from a facility as if it were a stand-alone
activity. Gross ITE trip generation rates do not account for trips already on adjacent roadways or
for internal capture. Hales Engineering did not adjust the gross trip generation to account for
pass-by trips; however, trips were adjusted to account for internal capture due to the mixed use
characteristics of the proposed project.

Following the ITE methodology for internal capture, a 15-percent reduction was calculated for
internal capture between the retail and residential land use.

No further reductions were made for the residential condominiums, or for the single family
dwelling units previously described because ITE Trip Generation rates for condominiums
already take into account the higher propensity for people living in condominiums to use
alternative modes of transportation.

Total new trips were calculated to be 2,171 vehicles per day in 2025.

The above discussed growth will add the following volumes to Warm Springs Road:

Daily Trips:
     2,834 vpd

P.M. Trips (east of the base area on Warm Springs Road):
    Eastbound          120 vph
    Westbound 120 vph
    Total              240 vph

In addition to the increased eastbound and westbound volumes discussed above, a growth rate
of 3 percent was used for all other movements at the study intersections.

The future 2018 p.m. peak hour traffic volumes are shown in Figures 5a and 5b.

C.     Level of Service Analysis

Using Synchro/SimTraffic, which follow the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010 methodology
introduced in Chapter I, the p.m. peak hour LOS was computed for each study intersection. The
results of this analysis are reported in Table 5 (see Appendix B for the detailed LOS reports).
Multiple runs of SimTraffic were used to provide a statistical evaluation of the interaction
between the intersections. These results serve as a baseline condition for the impact analysis of
the proposed development for future (2018) conditions. As shown in Table 5, all of the study
intersections have acceptable levels of service for the p.m. peak hour.

D.     Queuing Analysis

Hales Engineering calculated the 95th percentile queue lengths for each of the study
intersections. The queue reports can be found in Appendix D. Both the Lewis Street and Saddle
Road intersections are showing some queuing issues that could become problematic in the
future; however, both of these roads have other access points and ways to leave the area.

               VI. FUTURE (2018) PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS

A.     Purpose

This section of the report examines the traffic impacts of the proposed project at each of the
study intersections during future 2018 conditions. The trips generated by the proposed
development were combined with the future 2018 background traffic volumes to create the
future plus project conditions. The future plus project scenario evaluates the impacts of the
project traffic on the surrounding roadway network assuming build-out as discussed in Chapter
III of this report. This scenario provides valuable insight into the potential impacts of the
proposed project on future background traffic conditions.

B.     Traffic Volumes

Trips were assigned to the study intersections based on the trip distribution percentages
discussed in Chapter III and permitted intersection turning movements.

The future (2018) plus project p.m. peak hour volumes were generated for the study
intersections and are shown in Figure 6a and 6b.

C.     Level of Service Analysis

Using the Synchro/SimTraffic Software which follow the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010
methodology introduced in Chapter I, the future 2018 plus project p.m. peak hour LOS was
computed for each study intersection. The results of this analysis are reported in Table 6 (see
Appendix B for the detailed LOS reports). Multiple runs (10) of SimTraffic were used for the
analysis to provide a statistical evaluation of the interaction between the intersections. As shown
in Table 6, all of the study intersections experience acceptable levels of delay during the p.m.

D.     Queuing Analysis

Hales Engineering calculated the 95th percentile queue lengths for each of the study
intersections. The queue reports can be found in Appendix D. Both the Lewis Street and Saddle
Road intersections are showing some queuing issues that could become problematic in the
future; however, both of these roads have other access points and ways to leave the area, and
other forms of intersection control have been considered, which will change the queuing issues
created by the use of a traffic signal at Lewis Street.

E.        Mitigation Measures

No mitigations are recommended.

The Saddle Road intersection is too close to the Lewis Street intersection to be signalized;
however, if the Lewis Street and 10th Street intersections are changes into roundabouts,
consideration should be given to creating a roundabout at the Saddle Road intersection as well.

If the intersection were to remain with its current form or intersection control, on average,
vehicles will incur more delay waiting to make the southbound left turn movement with the
project traffic added to the future 2018 traffic. Additionally, the 95th percentile queue length for
that movement will be between 125 and 145 feet (or 6 to 7 vehicles). The nearest access along
Saddle Road is approximately 290-feet north of the intersection and will not be impacted by this
long queue during most times of the day.

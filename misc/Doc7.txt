                             EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
CGA was commissioned by PRH-2600 Hallandale Beach LLC to provide a Traffic Impact Study
for the development of "Beachwalk", located at 2600 Hallandale Beach Boulevard (State Road
858) within the City of Hallandale Beach. The proposed development is a multi-story building
that will consist of hotel and residential units. The project will be developed in one (1) distinct
phase, with opening year anticipated to occur in year 2015, as follows:

 1.    Hotel: 216 Two (2) bedroom suites and 216 standard rooms as well as a 1,225 square
       foot accessory hotel restaurant
 2.    High-Rise Condominium: 84 dwelling units

An assessment of the proposed development traffic for both the AM and PM peak period during
typical weekday conditions was performed. The existing roadway segment analysis shows that
all of the roadway segments within the study area currently operate at or above level of service
(LOS) "D" during the AM and PM peak period, with the exception of Hallandale Beach Boulevard
from NE 10th Avenue to NE 14th Avenue which operates below LOS "D" during the PM peak
period. The existing intersection analysis shows that all intersections within the study area
currently operate at or above LOS "D" during the AM peak hour, with the exception of E.
Hallandale Beach Boulevard at US 1. During the PM peak hour, the existing intersection
analysis shows that all intersections currently operate at or above LOS "D", with the exception
of Hallandale Beach Boulevard at NE 14th Avenue and Hallandale Beach Boulevard at US 1.

Committed development information was obtained from the Wal-mart Expansion Traffic Impact
Study, August 2010, provided by City staff, which included data from several of the most up-to-
date committed development studies for the city. The studies provided trip generation for the
PM peak period, however, no available AM peak period committed development data was
available. Therefore, since the developments listed in Table 4-1 would likely yield a higher
number of project trips in the PM peak hour, to be conservative, the reciprocal movements of
the PM peak hour committed trips were calculated and utilized for the AM peak hour committed
development trips.

The future traffic growth rate was developed using a trend analysis based on historical traffic
data from the FDOT Traffic DVD database. Historical trend analyses for traffic count stations
within the study area indicate that the average annual growth rate is approximately 0.5 percent
(%). This conservative annual growth rate was utilized to calculate expected background traffic
growth from the existing 2011 traffic volumes for the traffic impact area.

An analysis of Year 2015 traffic shows that each of the studied intersections operates at or
above LOS "D" with or without project-generated traffic, with the exception of the following
intersections which operate below LOS "D" with or without project-generated traffic:

 1.    Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Ocean Drive (AM and PM Peak)
 2.    Hallandale Beach Boulevard at NE 14th Avenue (AM and PM Peak)
 3.    Hallandale Beach Boulevard at US 1 (AM and PM Peak)
 4.    Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Drive (PM Peak Only). However, signal
       timing improvements proposed in this report will allow the intersection to operate at LOS
       "C" with project-generated traffic included.

                                                                                   August 2011
                                                                       CGA Project No. 11-4216
                                                                                         Page i
                                                                            Beachwalk Development
                                                                              Traffic Impact Report


In addition, all studied arterial links operate at or above LOS "D" with or without project-
generated traffic, with the exception of the following arterial links which operate below LOS "D"
with or without project-generated traffic:

 1.    Hallandale Beach Boulevard from US 1 to NE 10th Avenue (AM Peak)
 2.    Hallandale Beach Boulevard from US 1 to Layne Boulevard (PM Peak)

An analysis of the future 2015 conditions with project traffic showed that each of the failing
roadway segments within the study area will operate below acceptable levels of service
regardless of the addition of project traffic. The intersection level of service analysis for future
conditions including project traffic showed that each of the intersections performed at the same
level of service as the future conditions without project traffic during both the AM and PM peak
hour.

For the intersection of Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Drive, optimization of the
intersection signal timing resulted in the intersection operating at or above LOS "D" during both
the AM and PM peak periods with the addition of project-generated traffic.

In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that the traffic generated by the proposed
"Beachwalk" development project can be accommodated on the existing roadway network and
levels of service expected without the project can be maintained upon the addition of project-
generated traffic.

1.     Introduction
The purpose of this report is to document the results of the Traffic Impact Study for the
development of "Beachwalk", located at 2600 Hallandale Beach Boulevard (State Road
858) within the City of Hallandale Beach. There are currently no existing land uses at
the proposed site.

The following sections summarize the results of the traffic study, and provide a list of
options to be considered to mitigate any potential impacts of the project.

1.1    Project Description

PRH-2600 Hallandale Beach LLC is proposing the development of "Beachwalk", located
at 2600 Hallandale Beach Boulevard (State Road 858) within the City of Hallandale
Beach. This development is a multi-story building that will consist of a mix of hotel and
residential units. The project will be developed in one (1) distinct phase, with opening
year anticipated to occur in year 2015, as follows:

           1. Hotel: 216 Two (2) bedroom suites and 216 standard rooms with an
              accessory hotel restaurant: 1,225 square feet
           2. High-Rise Condominium: 84 dwelling units

1.2    Project Location

The project site is located just east of NE 26th Avenue, along the south side of
Hallandale Beach Boulevard. Figure 1-1 depicts the general location of the Beachwalk
development site and the study area.

1.3    Traffic Impact Study Area

The proposed study impact area for this project includes the region bounded by a one
mile radius circle extending out from the proposed project site. More specifically, the
study impact area is bounded by US 1 to the west and S. Ocean Drive (A1A to the east),
along Hallandale Beach Boulevard.

Since the proposed site is easily accessed via the regional roadway system, the area of
influence, where most of the traffic entering and exiting the project will be concentrated,
is limited to adjacent roadways and intersections in close proximity to the site.


                                                                         August 2011

2.     Data Collection
2.1    Existing Transport Characteristics

The proposed site is surrounded by the following state and/or local roadways:
Hallandale Beach Boulevard to the immediate north, SE 26th Ave to the east, Diana Drive
to the immediate south, and Golden Isles Drive to the west.

Transit service to the project study area is provided by Broward County Transit lines 1,
4, 5, 28, and the US 1 Breeze.

Transit route maps and service schedules are shown in Appendix A.

2.2    Traffic Count Data

Turning movement counts (TMC's) were collected during the AM and PM peak period on
a typical weekday within the determined traffic study area. A seasonal factor obtained
from the 2009 FDOT Florida Traffic Information DVD of 1.2 was used to adjust the raw
turning movement counts to peak season turning movement counts. Locations for
typical weekday turning movement counts are included in Appendix B, and listed below:

           1. Hallandale Beach Boulevard at US 1
           2. Hallandale Beach Boulevard at NE 8th Avenue
           3. Hallandale Beach Boulevard at NE 10th Avenue
           4. Hallandale Beach Boulevard at NE 14th Avenue
           5. Hallandale Beach Boulevard at 3 Islands Boulevard
           6. Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Drive
           7. Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Layne Boulevard
           8. Hallandale Beach Boulevard at SE 26th Avenue
           9. Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Diplomat Parkway
           10. Hallandale Beach Boulevard at South Ocean Drive
           11. South Ocean Drive NB Ramp to Hallandale Beach Boulevard WB

In addition to the traffic data counts, existing characteristics of the roadway network
including intersection geometry, lane geometry and posted speed limits within the traffic
study area were verified.

A conservative growth rate factor of 0.5% was applied to all of the existing traffic data
counts to forecast future background conditions. Growth rate data is included in
Appendix C.


                                                                   August 2011

2.3    Additional Traffic Data Collection

       2.3.1 Signal Timing Analysis ­ Existing signal timing and phasing was
               obtained from Broward County Traffic Engineering, and is included in
               Appendix D.

       2.3.2 Weekly Adjustment Factors - These factors were used to adjust raw
               counts to reflect average annual traffic for typical weekday conditions.
               These factors were obtained from the 2009 FDOT Florida Traffic
               Information DVD.

       2.3.3 Peak Hour Factors ­ A peak hour factor of 0.92 was used for hourly
               variation of the traffic flow in the peak period, as prescribed by the
               Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) within the Quality/Level of
               Service Handbook.

3.       Existing Conditions Analysis
Analysis of existing traffic conditions was performed for the AM and PM peak hour
conditions on the roadway segments within the study area. The Florida Department of
Transportation (FDOT) Generalized Level of Service (LOS) Tables were used to identify
the vehicular capacity on the roadway segments. Intersection levels of service were
determined for the AM and PM peak period conditions using Synchro (version 7.0) based
on the procedures of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) at all intersections within the
study area, with the exception of E. Hallandale Beach Boulevard at SE 26th Avenue,
which was analyzed based on the procedures of the Intersection Capacity Utilization
(ICU).    The levels of service thresholds used for the analysis are based on the
"Generalized" tables for Urbanized Areas within the FDOT Level of Service Handbook for
the Broward County adopted threshold, which is Level of Service "D".

Level of Service (LOS) is a quality measure describing operational conditions within a
traffic stream, generally in terms of such service measures as speed and travel time,
freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and comfort and convenience.

Six (6) LOS are defined for each type of facility that have HCM analysis procedures
available. Letters designate each level, from A to F, with LOS A representing the best
operating conditions and LOS F the worst. Each level of service represents a range of
operating conditions and the driver's perception of those conditions.        Safety is not
included in the measures that establish service levels. Eight (8) LOS are defined for
each intersection analyzed using ICU procedures. Letters designate each level, ranging
from A to H. Similar to the HCM method, LOS A signifies that an intersection has no
congestion and LOS H represents an intersection that is over capacity.

3.1          Roadway Segment Level of Service Summary

The AM and PM peak hour weekday link volumes within the study area were estimated
using the adjusted AM and PM peak hour turning movement counts. The resulting link
and intersection data are summarized on Figure 3-1.

The link maximum service volumes used in this study are derived from the 2009 FDOT
Quality/Level of Service Handbook. Table 3-1 includes facility type, number of travel
lanes, existing AM and PM peak hour volumes, AM and PM peak hour maximum service
volumes, the adopted level of service standard and AM and PM peak hour level of
service.

The analysis shows that all of the roadway segments within the study area currently
operate at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM peak period, with the
exception of Hallandale Beach Boulevard from NE 10th Avenue to NE 14th Avenue during
the PM peak period.

3.2          Intersection Level of Service Summary

The collected turning movement counts were converted to average turning movement
volumes by applying a peak season conversion factor (PSCF).                           The peak season
conversion factors were obtained from the 2009 Florida Traffic Information & Highway
DVD. These volumes are also summarized on Figure 3-1.

The analysis shows that all intersections within the study area currently operate at
acceptable levels of service1 during the AM peak hour, with the exception of Hallandale
Beach Boulevard at US 1. During the PM peak hour, all intersections currently operate at
acceptable levels of service, with the exception of Hallandale Beach Boulevard at NE 14th
Avenue and Hallandale Beach Boulevard at US 1. The existing intersection levels of
service analysis worksheets are summarized on Figure 3-1a, Figure 3-1b and included in
Appendix E.

4.      Future Traffic Projections
Analysis of future traffic projections within the study area was performed for two
scenarios: a) background traffic plus committed development traffic and b) total traffic
which includes background traffic, committed development traffic, plus project traffic.
The purpose of the analysis is to isolate the impacts of the traffic associated with the
project from traffic due to population growth and construction of new developments.

The following sections describe the process used to determine future roadway
improvements planned by the City, County, and state agencies; the methodology used
to estimate background traffic; traffic from committed developments; and trips
associated with the proposed site.

4.1     Planned and Programmed Roadway Improvements

Programmed (funded and/or committed) transportation improvements within the traffic
impact study area were collected using Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT)
five year work program, Broward County's Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) and the 2035 Long Range Transportation
Plan (LRTP).    There were no capacity improvement projects funded for construction
prior to or on the proposed project site opening year, planned for 2015. Therefore, the
existing roadway geometry within the study area was used as the future roadway
network in the future analysis.

4.2     Background Traffic

Background traffic was calculated to account for committed traffic and growth in the
area.   Future background traffic for this study was developed by applying a yearly
growth rate to the seasonally adjusted 2011 traffic counts to estimate the background
traffic for the year 2015, which is the project's anticipated build out year.

The growth rate utilized was 0.5 percent (%) to represent the expected traffic growth
within the entire traffic impact area. This growth rate was then applied to the 2011
traffic counts to estimate the 2015 future background traffic volumes within the traffic
impact area.

4.3        Committed Developments

Committed development information was obtained from The City of Hallandale staff
from the Wal-mart Expansion Traffic Impact Study, August 2010, which included data
from several of the most up-to-date committed development studies for the city. Table
4-1 lists the committed development information provided within this study, including
their project trips. Each of the committed developments was accounted for, with the
exception of the "European Club". At the direction of City of Hallandale Beach Staff,
"European Club" was omitted, due to inactivity in the allotted time outlined in the
Developer's Agreement. Committed development data is included in Appendix F.

The studies provided trip generation for the PM peak period. However, no available AM
peak period committed development data was available. Therefore, since the
developments listed in Table 4-1 would likely yield a higher number of project trips in
the PM peak hour, to be conservative, the reciprocal movements of the AM peak hour
committed trips were calculated for the PM peak hour committed development trips. The
number of trips from each development was added to the 2015 background traffic based
on the trip assignment included in the traffic report to develop the total background
traffic.

An analysis of existing traffic, plus background, plus committed traffic, shows that each
of the intersections operates at acceptable levels of service, with the exception of the
following:

4.4    Project Traffic

Project traffic was developed using trip generation rates from The Trip Generation
Manual, 7th Edition, by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE).

4.4.1 Trip Generation

Trip generation is the method by which the amount of traffic, or the number of trips to
and from a site, is estimated. The Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, by the Institute
of Transportation Engineers (ITE), is a common source of trip generation characteristics,
providing data on a variety of development types on daily and peak-hour basis.

Based upon the ITE land use codes, the proposed project's trip generation was
determined, as follows:

       ·   ITE Land Use Code 311 (All Suites Hotel)
       ·   ITE Land Use Code 310 (Hotel)
       ·   ITE Land Use Code 232 (High-Rise Condominium)

ITE land uses for Hotel as well as All Suites Hotel were applied to the 216 units due to
the fact that each unit will have the capability of functioning as two distinct hotel units,
one with a kitchen and one without a kitchen.

Internal Capture Volumes

Internal capture trips are trips that occur between various land uses within the
development without needing to access the external roadway network. Internal capture
is not expected for the project.

Pass-By Capture Volumes

A portion of the trips at the project driveways will be the result of the project's new
trips. Pass-by trips are stops on the way from an origin to a primary trip destination
without a route diversion and that are existing trips on the roadway network. The pass-
by percentage for the various land uses were determined using the rates provided in the
ITE Trip Generation Handbook.

Net New Project Trips

Net new, external vehicle trips are equal to the gross project trips minus the internal
capture trips and the pass-by capture trips. As identified in the 2035 Broward County
Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP), Hallandale Beach Boulevard and SR A1A
(Ocean Drive) have been identified as routes for premium rapid bus transit services
within the limits of this project study area with a mobility hub planned for
implementation in FY 2014-2015 at Hallandale Beach Boulevard and US 1. A community
hub is also planned for inclusion at Hallandale Beach Boulevard and A1A, as well as
Hallandale Beach Boulevard and NE 14th Avenue.

Table 4-2 shows the project trip generation for the AM, PM and daily periods for the
project site.

4.4.2 Trip Distribution

The trip distribution of the project's traffic was estimated based on an analysis of the
surrounding roadway network characteristics, review of current entering and exiting
traffic volume ratios for the project study area and existing land use patterns. This was
primarily done due to the small-scale nature of this project. A FSUTMS model run would
not provide the same level of detail as the analysis of current trend analysis. This trip
distribution method used the existing turning movement counts to calculate the AM and
PM peak hour link volumes entering and exiting the project impact area. Using the total
volumes in the traffic impact area, distribution ratios were calculated entering and
exiting each link. These ratios were then applied to the AM and PM peak trips.

4.4.3 Trip Assignment

Based upon the trip distribution described in the previous section, the total weekday AM
and PM peak project trips were assigned to the roadway network. Figure 4-3 shows the
trip distribution and assignment on the roadway network.

Trip generation analysis data is included in Appendix G.

5.     Future Traffic Analysis
Analysis of future conditions was performed for weekday AM and PM peak hour
conditions on the roadway segments within the study area based on the Florida
Department of Transportation Generalized Level of Service (LOS) Tables.

Intersection levels of service were determined for the AM and PM peak period conditions
using Synchro (version 7.0) based on the procedures of the 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual and Intersection Capacity Utilization. Intersection signal timing green splits were
optimized for all future traffic analysis with the cycle lengths held consistent with
existing conditions, as shown on the Synchro output sheets in Appendix H.

The levels of service thresholds used for the analysis are based on the "Generalized"
tables for Urbanized Areas within the FDOT Level of Service Handbook adopted for
Broward County which is LOS D. Level of service thresholds are discussed in more detail
in Section 3.2 of this document.

Table 5-1 summarizes the arterial analysis of existing, background plus committed, and
project traffic vehicular volumes.

5.1    Roadway Segment Level of Service Summary

Similar to Figure 4-1, Figure 5-1 shows that all the arterial links operate at acceptable
levels of service, with the exception of the following:

 1.    Hallandale Beach Boulevard from US 1 to NE 10th Avenue (AM Peak)
 2.    Hallandale Beach Boulevard from US 1 to Layne Boulevard (PM Peak)

Therefore, each of the failing roadway segments within the study area will operate
below acceptable levels of service regardless of the addition of project traffic.

5.2    Intersection Level of Service Summary

The intersection level of service analysis performed for future conditions including the
project traffic showed that each of the intersections performed at the same level of
service as the future conditions without including the project traffic.

An analysis of existing traffic, plus background, plus committed traffic, shows that each
of the intersections operates at acceptable levels of service, with the exception of the
following:

 1.    Hallandale   Beach   Boulevard   at   Ocean Drive (AM and PM Peak)
 2.    Hallandale   Beach   Boulevard   at   NE 14th Avenue (AM and PM Peak)
 3.    Hallandale   Beach   Boulevard   at   US 1 (AM and PM Peak)
 4.    Hallandale   Beach   Boulevard   at   Golden Isles Drive (PM Peak Only)

As a secondary measure, operational improvements were examined to improve
intersection levels of service. As a first step, signal operations were improved by
optimization of the intersection green splits. This operational improvement showed
reduced delay time for each of the signalized intersections and even improved several
intersections which were operating below acceptable levels of service. Upon completion
of this measure, the analysis shows that the following intersections will still operate
below an acceptable level of service:

 1.    Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Ocean Drive (PM Peak Only)
 2.    Hallandale Beach Boulevard at NE 14th Avenue (PM Peak Only)
 3.    Hallandale Beach Boulevard at US 1 (AM and PM Peak)

As shown, the addition of the project traffic to the roadway network will not deteriorate
the intersection level of service for any studied intersections beyond projected future
background conditions.

6.     Conclusion and Recommendations
CGA was commissioned by PRH-2600 Hallandale Beach LLC to provide a Traffic
Impact Study for the development of "Beachwalk", located at 2600 Hallandale
Beach Boulevard (State Road 858) within the City of Hallandale Beach.            The
proposed development is a multi-story building that will consist of hotel and
residential units. The project will be developed in one (1) distinct phase, with
opening year anticipated to occur in year 2015, as follows:

1.     Hotel: 216 Two (2) bedroom suites and 216 standard rooms as well as a
1,225 square foot accessory hotel restaurant
2.     High-Rise Condominium: 84 dwelling units

An assessment of the proposed development traffic for both the AM and PM peak
period during typical weekday conditions was performed. The existing roadway
segment analysis shows that all of the roadway segments within the study area
currently operate at or above level of service (LOS) "D" during the AM and PM
peak period, with the exception of Hallandale Beach Boulevard from NE 10th
Avenue to NE 14th Avenue which operates below LOS "D" during the PM peak
period. The existing intersection analysis shows that all intersections within the
study area currently operate at or above LOS "D" during the AM peak hour, with
the exception of E. Hallandale Beach Boulevard at US 1. During the PM peak
hour, the existing intersection analysis shows that all intersections currently
operate at or above LOS "D", with the exception of Hallandale Beach Boulevard
at NE 14th Avenue and Hallandale Beach Boulevard at US 1.

Committed development information was obtained from the Wal-mart Expansion
Traffic Impact Study, August 2010, provided by City staff, which included data
from several of the most up-to-date committed development studies for the city.
The studies provided trip generation for the PM peak period, however, no
available AM peak period committed development data was available. Therefore,
since the developments listed in Table 4-1 would likely yield a higher number of
project trips in the PM peak hour, to be conservative, the reciprocal movements
of the PM peak hour committed trips were calculated and utilized for the AM
peak hour committed development trips.

                                                                        Traffic Impact Report

The future traffic growth rate was developed using a trend analysis based on
historical traffic data from the FDOT Traffic DVD database. Historical trend
analyses for traffic count stations within the study area indicate that the average
annual growth rate is approximately 0.5 percent (%). This conservative annual
growth rate was utilized to calculate expected background traffic growth from
the existing 2011 traffic volumes for the traffic impact area.

An analysis of Year 2015 traffic shows that each of the studied intersections
operates at or above LOS "D" with or without project-generated traffic, with the
exception of the following intersections which operate below LOS "D" with or
without project-generated traffic:

1.     Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Ocean Drive (AM and PM Peak)
2.     Hallandale Beach Boulevard at NE 14th Avenue (AM and PM Peak)
3.     Hallandale Beach Boulevard at US 1 (AM and PM Peak)
4.     Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Drive (PM Peak Only).
       However, signal timing improvements proposed in this report will allow
       the intersection to operate at LOS "C" with project-generated traffic
       included.

In addition, all studied arterial links operate at or above LOS "D" with or without
project-generated traffic, with the exception of the following arterial links which
operate below LOS "D" with or without project-generated traffic:

1.     Hallandale Beach Boulevard from US 1 to NE 10th Avenue (AM Peak)
2.     Hallandale Beach Boulevard from US 1 to Layne Boulevard (PM Peak)

An analysis of the future 2015 conditions with project traffic showed that each of
the failing roadway segments within the study area will operate below acceptable
levels of service regardless of the addition of project traffic. The intersection level
of service analysis for future conditions including project traffic showed that each
of the intersections performed at the same level of service as the future
conditions without project traffic during both the AM and PM peak hour.

For the intersection of Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Drive,
optimization of the intersection signal timing resulted in the intersection
operating at or above LOS "D" during both the AM and PM peak periods with the
addition of project-generated traffic.

In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that the traffic generated by the
proposed "Beachwalk" development project can be accommodated on the existing
roadway network and levels of service expected without the project can be maintained
upon the addition of project-generated traffic.

  Values shown are presented as hourly two-way volumes for levels of service and are for the automobile/truck modes unless specifically stated. Although presented as peak hour two-
way volumes, they actually represent peak hour peak direction conditions with an applicable D factor applied. This table does not constitute a standard and should be used only for
general planning applications. The computer models from which this table is derived should be used for more specific planning applications. The table and deriving computer models
should not be used for corridor or intersection design, where more refined techniques exist. Calculations are based on planning applications of the Highway Capacity Manual, Bicycle
LOS Model, Pedestrian LOS Model and Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, respectively for the automobile/truck, bicycle, pedestrian and bus modes.
2
  Level of service for the bicycle and pedestrian modes in this table is based on number of motorized vehicles, not number of
bicyclists or pedestrians using the facility.
3
    Buses per hour shown are only for the peak hour in the single direction of the higher traffic flow.
* For oversaturated conditions during peak hour, subtract 10% from the LOS E (capacity volumes).
 This number becomes the new maximum service volume for LOS D, and LOS E cannot be achieved.                                                 Source:
** Cannot be achieved using table input value defaults.                                                                                      Florida Department of Transportation
*** Not applicable for that level of service letter grade. For the automobile mode, volumes greater than level of service D                  Systems Planning Office
 become F because intersection capacities have been reached. For the bicycle mode, the level of service letter grade (including              605 Suwannee Street, MS 19
 F) is not achievable because there is no maximum vehicle volume threshold using table input value defaults.                                 Tallahassee, FL 32399-0450

               1.0         INTROD UCTION

              As a result of community concems from the residents in the area of Golden Isles Dri ve near
              Hallandale Beach Boulevard in Hallandale Beach, Florida, a Qual itative Assessment of the
              existing traffic condit ions was performed at the intersections of Hallandale Beach Boulevard
              at Golden Isles Drive, Golden Isles Drive at Diana Dri ve and NE 26th Avenue at Hallandale
              Beach Boulevard. A Qualitative Assessment is a study where a professionally registered
              qualified Lraffic e ngineer experienced in the traffic engineering discipline, vi sits the location
              under study during the moming and evening peak troffic periods to make qualitative
              assessments of the intersection operation. Such factors as queue lengths, delays, vehicular
              con nicts or any other operational characteristics cri tical to eva luate the need fo r intersection
              improvements, such as signal control or geometric improvements are noted . During the fi eld
              review safety conditions are also observed and recorded. wilh photographs taken of all
              intersection approaches with emphasis on obtaining visual information that would be of value
              to the study.

              Field observation reports for each orthe study intersection are included in Appe ndix A.

In the vicinjty of the study area, Hallandale Beach Boulevard is a six~lane divided state road,
running in an east~ west direction; with a posted speed limit of 3S mph. Go lden Isles Drive is
a t\J,;o-lane undivided local road running in a nonh·south direction; with posted speed limit of
2S mph. Diana Drive is a nllo-lane undivided local road, running in an east-west direction,
with a posted speed limit of 30 mph. NE 26th A venue is two-lane undiv ided local road
running in a north-south direction; with no posted speed limit.

Hallandale Beach Boulevard is serv iced by Broward County Trans it lines 4 and 28 ,
connecting to olher servjce lines such as lines I, S, and the US I Breeze.

Pavement condition and pavement markings appear to be in fair to good co ndition at each of
the intersections. No notable regulatory signage problems were observed. Roadway lightin*
exists along Hallandale Beach Boulevard . Golden Isles Drive, Diana Drive and NE 26 1
Avenue. At the study intersections, sidewalks exist along the north and south sides of
Hallandal e Beach Boulevard, and the east and west sides of both NE 261h Avenue and Golden
Isles Drive. However, no sidewalks are present along Diana Drive.

2.1.1     Hallandale Beach Boulevard al Golden Isles Drive (signalized)

The intersecrio n of HaUandale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Dri ve is signalized, with up
to four pha ses operating during the day. A bank exists directly on the southeast comer of the
intersection with a two-way driveway on Hallandale Beach Boule vard just east of the
intersection and one-way inbound driveway on Golden Isles Drive just south of the
intersecti on. A law office exists on the southwest comer of the intersection with a nvo-way
driveway on Golden Isles Drive just south of the intersection. A commerc ial shopping exists
on the north side of the intersection.

Signal operation provides up to four phases including the following:

          Westbound left-rum lead phase
          EastboundlWestbound phase
          Northbound split phase
          Southbound split phase

A field sketch is included as pal1 of the Field Observation Report m Appendix A.
Intersection approach lane configuration is as follows:

          Northbound: I l eft, 1 Shared Thrulleft, I Right
          Southbound: I LeO, I Shared Thru/right
          EaSlbound:  2 TIuu, I Shared Tbrulrigh.
          Westbound: I l eft,. 2 Thru. I Shared Thrulright

North of Diana Drive, northbound Golden Isles widens from a I-lane section to a 2-lane
section to accommodate the Hallandale Beach Boulevard/Golden Isles Drive intersection.
The northbound approach has a left-tum bay of nearly 200 feet. This lane appears to have the

capacity to store up to approximately 12 vehicles before spilling back into the thru lane. The
shared thruIleft tum lane and the right tum lane have approximately 300 feel of queue storage
betvleen Hallandale Beach Boulevard and Diana Drive, which appears to have the capacity to
store up to approximately 15 vehicles, before i.mpeding the Golden Isles Drive/Diana Drive
intersection. A smal l 4-foot concrete median divider exists on the northbound approach from
the stop bar for approximately 140 feel.

The southbound approach serves as a driveway ingress/egress to a commercial shoppiog
center. At the intersection there is one wide ingress lane with an exclusive left tum lane and
one shared rightlthru lane for the egress movement on the north leg. The southbound
approach has approximately 120 feet of queue storage for both lanes. No median exists on
the southbound approach .

The westboW1d approach contains three lanes serving thru traffi c. with the outside lane acting
as a shared thrulright lane and a separate left-tum lane of approximately 200 feet, which
appears to have a length suITici.ent for storing approximately 8 10 10 vehicles. There is
approximately 350 fee t of slorage along Hallandale Beach Boulevard between the Golden
Isles Dri ve intersection and the preceding Diplomat Parkway intersection.

The eastbound approach contains three lanes serving thru traffic, with the outside Jane acting
as a shared thru/right laoe. Eastbound left turns are prohibited and no left-tum lane ex ists.
There is approximately 200 feet of storage along Hallandale Beach Boulevard between the
Golden Isles Drive intersection and the preceding Layne Boulevard intersection.

At the intersection, designated pedestrian crossings, each with corresponding pedestrian
signal head s, are preseot on the south and east legs. The crosswalks on tbe south and east
legs are stamp ed asphalt brick paver type . Ped estri an curb ramps and push buttons are
present on the northeast, southeast and southwest corners of the intersection to correspond
with th e crosswalk locations. Although m easurements to check compliance with the
Americans with Disability Act (ADA) standards are not part of this study. these ramps
appear to be in compliance.

2.1.2     Goldel1 lsles Drive a l Diana Drive (un-signalized)

The inte rsect ion of Golden Isles Drive at Diana Drive is an un-signalized T-intersection, with
no west leg. The westbound approach is stop controlled and the north and south approaches
are free flow . There is a service driveway appro.'(...i.mately 50 feet north of the intersec ti on that
runs only in Ihe westbound direction and is righHwn only at Golden Isles Drive. This
driveway services the rear entrance several of the residential buildings and commercial
businesses between Hallandale Beach Boulevard aod Diana Drive. The service driveway and
Diana Drive are separated by an approximately I O·[oot wide landscaped median and a 8·foot
wide parallel parking Jane.

Each of Ule approaches is l-Jaoe on a 2-lane undivided roadway. There is no separate left
tum o r right -fUm lanes. There are no c rosswa lks present at the intersection .

2.1.3     Hallandale Beach Boulevard at NE 2r!h Avenue (un-signalized)

The intersection of Hallandale Beach Boulevard at NE 26th Avenue is an un-signalized T
intersection, \vitb no north leg. The northbound approach is stop controlled and the east and
west approaches are free flow. The ingress of a service driveway is approximately 275 feet
south of the intersection that runs only in the westbound direction.

At the intersection, the northbound approach consists of a single right-tum only lane and the
eastbound and westbound approaches are separated by approximately an 18-foot center
landscaped median. There is a separate left-tum lanes approximately 350 feet in length in the
westbound direction, which appears to have sufficient length for storing approximately 16 to
18 vehicles. There is a designated crosswalk with corresponding curb ramps present on the
south leg of the intersection.

2.2        Field Observations

The following section documents observations made regarding traffic operations and safety
at the study intersection during field visits conducted by a qualified traffic engineer during
the AM and PM peak periods on Thursday, October 6, 2011. Photographs pertinent to field
conditions and traffic operations are included in Appendix B.

2.2.1      General Observations

Based on observation during both morning and evening periods, the eastbound and
westbound approaches of Hallandale Beach Boulevard both serve heavy traffic movemeots,
and eastbound and westbound tlUll movements receive a high percentage of green time at the
Hallandale Beach Boulevard/Golden Isles Drive intersection. At times, the signal timlng
coordination at the adjacent intersections appears to get off and queues from the Layne
Boulevard intersection and the Diplomat Parkway intersection and extends through the
Golden Isles Drive intersection. Hov,rever, the queues dispersed quickly and did not impact
the northbound or southbound movements at Golden Isles Drive. In comparison. northbound
and southbound approaches both receive a limited amount of green time, but did oot
experience cycle failure. A signal cycle length of approximately 160 seconds was observed
in both the AM peak period and PM peak period.

Very little traffic was observed along Diana Drive and NE 26 th Avenue during both the AJvf
and PM peak periods. Occasionally a westbound right turning vehicle was observed at the
Hallandale Beach BoulevardINE 261h A venue intersection, however there was no queue at
most times during both the ANf and PM peak periods. In addition, during both the AM and
PM peak periods, there was little to no queue observed in the westbound direction at the
Golden Isles Drive/Diana Drive intersection. However, the maximum queue observed in the
during both peak periods was 2 vehicles.

   ·  All northbound vehicJes were able to clear the intersection during the green phase
       with no cycle failures.
      ·  On the Donhbound approach an average queue of 4 vehicles was observed (2 vehicles
         in the left tum lane, 2 vehicles in the shared thru/left turn lane), maximum 8 vehicles
         (4 vehicles in the left rum lane, 4 vehicles in the shared t.hn.1I1eft tum lane) .
      ·  A couple of northbound vehlcles were observed to utili zing the Post Offic e parking
         lot as a cut-thru from Golden Isles 10 Layne BouJevard, although linle to no queu e
         was present at in the non hbound direction on Golde n Is les Drive.
      ·  Very few westbound left turns were observed.

   ·  All northbound vehicles were able to clear the interSection during the green phase
       with no cycle failures.
      ·  On Ihe nOrlhbound approach an average queue of8 vehicles was observed (4 vehicles
         in the left tum lane, 4 vehicles in the shared thrulleft tum Jane), maxi mum 14 vehicles
         (7 vehicles in the left fUm lane, 7 vehicles in the shared thrw'left rum lane). These
         vehicles were accommodated within the existing storage, without impacting the
         Golden Isles Drive/Diana Drive intersection.
      ·  A moderate amount of westbound left turns were observed (max 2 vehicle queue).

1.2       Traffic Count Data

Manual turning movement C     OWlts were conducted on July 13, 20 II for the Hallandale Beach
Boulevard/Golden Isles Drive and Hallandale Beach BoulevardlNE 26111 Avenue
intersections. The intersect ion of Golden Isles Drive at Diana Drive was conducted on July
28,2011. The turning movement counts were performed from 7:00 to 9:00 AM and 4:00 to
6:00 PM. A summary of the turning movement counts are shown in Table I. Raw traffic
count data is included in Appendix C.

From review ing Lbe traffic count, it is noted that the northbound approach at the Hallandale
Beach Boulevard/Golden Isles Drive intersection is heaviest during the PM peak period.
Combined with heav ier weslbound right rum movemenls at the Golden Isles Drive/Diana
Drive intersection resulted in longer queue lengths in the on the northbound approach at the
Hallandale Beach Boulevard/Golden Isles Drive intersection during the PM peak period, as
observed during the field observations.

As noted in the fi eld observations, the northbound approach at the Hallandale Beach
BoulevardINE 26th Avenue intersection showed very little traffic , which resulted in little to
no queumg.

3.0                  LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS

Existing and future intersection levels of service were determined for the AM and PM peak
period conditions using Synchro (version 7.0) based on the procedures of the Highway
Capacity Manual (HeM) at all intersections within the study area.

Level of Service (LOS) is a quality measure describing operational conditions within a traffic
stream, generally in tenns of such service measures as speed and travel time, freedom to
maneuver, traffic interruptions, and comfort and convenience.

Six (6) LOS are defined for each type of facility that have HeM analysis procedures
available. Letters designate each level, from A to F, with LOS A representing the best
operating conditions and LOS F the worst. Each level of service represents a range of
operating conditions and the driver's perception of those conditions. Safety is not included
in the measures that establish service levels.

As shown in the traffic data section, the collected turning movement counts were converted
to average turning movement volumes by applying a peak seasoo conversion factor (PSCF).

The peak season conversion factors were obtained from the 20 I 0 Florida Traffic Information
& Highway DVD.

The existing intersection level of service analysis shows that the intersections of Hallandale

A venue at Hallandale Beach Boulevard currently operate within the Broward County
acceptable level of service "D" range during both the Ai\1 and PM peak hours.

The future intersection level of service analysis perfonned for future (2015) conditions both
with and without project traffic also show that showed that the intersections of Hallandale

A venue at Hallandale Beach Boulevard currently operate within the Broward County
acceptable level of service "D" range during both the AM and PM peak hours, with the
exception of the Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Drive during the PM peak
period.

Because of the fact that during the PM peak period the Hallandale Beach Boulevard/Golden
Isles Drive intersection is failing in the future without the proposed project trips of the
Beachwalk development, it can be assumed that the increase in delay and level of service is
primarily attributed to other committed developments in the area.

However, operational improvements were examined at the Hallandale Beach
Boulevard/Golden Isles Drive intersection to improve future intersection levels of service
during the PM peak period. As a first step, signal operations were improved by optimization
of the intersection green splits and improved coordination along Hallandale Beach
Boulevard. This operational improvement showed reduced delay time the signalized
intersection and even improved the level of service within the Sroward County acceptable
level of service "D" range.

The existing intersection and future levels of service analysis worksheets are summarized in
Table 2 and included in Appendix D.

4.0           CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

From a review of field conditions, traffic operations, traffic count data and level of service
analysis, for the most part there were very little traffic concerns observed at the study
intersections of Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Drive, Golden Isles Drive at
Diana Drive and NE 26 th Avenue at Hallandale Beach Boulevard.

Based on field observations, it appears that during both the AM and PM peak periods that
Hallandale Beach Boulevard has congestion which is primarily due to poor signal
coordination. However, the queues dispersed quickly and did not impact the northbound or
southbound movements along Golden Isles Drive.

The northbound approach on Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Drive showed the
highest queues during the PM peak period. During this time, a maximum of 14 vehicles (7
vehicles in the left tum lane, 7 vehicles in the shared thruIleft tum lane) were observed.
These vehicles were accommodated within the existing storage, without impacting the
Golden Isles DrivelDiana Drive intersection. In addition, during the maximum queue length
no cycle failures were observed and all northbound vehicles were able to clear the
intersection during the green phase.

Very little traffic was observed along Diana Drive and NE 261h Avenue during both the AM
and PM peak periods. Occasionally a westbound right turning vehicle was observed a( the
Hallandale Beach BoulevardiNE 26th A venue intersection, however there was no queue at
most times during both the AM and PM peak periods.


The existing intersection level of service analysis shows that the intersections of Hallandale
Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Drive, Golden Isles Drive at Diana Drive and NE 26th

Avenue at Hallandale Beach Boulevard currently operate within the Broward County
acceptable level of service "0" range during both the AM and PM peak hours.

However, the future intersection level of service analysis perfonned for future (2015)
cond itions both with and without project traffic also show that showed that the intersections
of Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Drive, Golden Isles Drive at Diana Drive and
NE 26 th Avenue at Hallandale Beach Boulevard currently operate within the Broward County
acceptable level of service "D" range during both the AM and PM peak hours, with the
exception of the Hal landale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Drive during the PM peak
period.

Because of the fact thai during the PM peak period the Hallandale Beach Boulevard/Golden
Isles Drive intersection is failing in the future without the proposed project trips of the
Beachwalk development , it can be assumed that the increase in dela y and level of service is
primarily attributed to other committed developments in the area.

However, operational improvements were examined at the Hallandale Beach
Boulevard/Golden Isles Drive intersection to improve future intersection le vels of serv ice
during the PM peak period. As a first step, signal operations were improved by optimization
of the intersection green spli ts and improVed coordination along Hallandale Beach
Boulevard. This operational improvement showed reduced delay time the signalized
intersection and even improved the level of se rvice within the Broward County acceptable
level of service "D" range.

Based on the result of this study, the on ly recommendations that are suggested for the
Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Drive, Golden Isles Drive at Diana Drive and
NE 26lh Avenue at Hallandale Beach Boulevard intersections is to coordinate with Sroward
County Traffic Engineering Division to suggest identified signal timing improvements along
Hallandale Beach Boulevard and at the Hallandale Beach Boulevard at Golden Isles Dlive
intersection at completion of the proposed Beachwalk development.

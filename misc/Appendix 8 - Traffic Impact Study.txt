1.0     INTRODUCTION

This study has been prepared to evaluate the transportation impacts of the proposed Convention Center to
be located in downtown Albany, New York. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impacts of the
proposed development on the area transportation system, including traffic operations, transit systems,
parking, and pedestrian and bike accommodations. The study also identifies alternatives and measures to
mitigate these impacts.



2.0     PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

The proposed Convention Center is located on an approximately 16-acre site located between Hudson
Avenue, Madison Avenue, South Pearl Street and Broadway. The project site is shown on Figure 2-1.
The primary Master Plan Area is defined as the area bounded by Broadway, South Pearl Street, State
Street and Madison Avenue. This Master Plan area is also shown on Figure 2-1.


The Convention Center is proposed to be developed in two phases. Phase One will have a total building
area of 244,000 square feet. Phase Two is proposed to provide an additional 161,000 square feet of
building area, for a completed Convention Center of 405,000 square feet. The composition of this
building program is summarized in Table 2-1.

          Circulation, Walls, Chases, Etc.       37,000 sf       23,000 sf         66,000 sf

          Gross Building Area                  244,000 sf       155,000 sf       405,000 sf


Hotel facilities are also planned to be located on the site, to provide a total of 400 rooms.       The
employment for the Convention Center and hotel facilities is projected to be equivalent to 350 full-time
employees.


The proximity of the proposed Convention Center to the nearby Times Union Center offers an
opportunity to have coordinated activity for an additional 25,000 sq ft exhibition space at the Times

Union Center, which is proposed to be linked to the Convention Center by a climate-controlled overhead
pedestrian connection.


Phase One construction is anticipated to be completed in 2010, with program stabilization in 2014. The
hotel facilities are planned to be constructed in Phase One. Phase Two construction would be constructed
some time after 2014, based on a future assessment of market conditions.

3.0     EXISTING CONDITIONS
3.1     Study Area

The study area for the project includes intersections surrounding the site and key intersections in the area
that may be impacted by the estimated site traffic. The study area intersections are as follows:


            ·   Broadway & State Street
            ·   Broadway, Broadway-Quay Street Connector & Water Street
            ·   Broadway & Hudson Avenue
            ·   Broadway & Division Street
            ·   Madison Avenue, Broadway & I-787 Southbound Ramps
            ·   Madison Avenue & Green Street
            ·   Pearl Street & Madison Avenue
            ·   Pearl Street & Empire State Plaza Arterial Eastbound Ramps
            ·   Pearl Street & Empire State Plaza Arterial Westbound Ramps
            ·   Pearl Street & Hudson Avenue
            ·   Pearl Street & State Street
            ·   Hudson Avenue & Green Street

These study intersections include locations where the local street system interfaces with the regional
highway network and the circulation streets around the project site. These study intersections are shown
in relation to the Convention Center site on Figure 3-1.

3.2     Area Roadway System

I-787 is a limited-access expressway facility providing access to downtown Albany from the region's
interstate highway system. I-787 has three through travel lanes in each direction, and connects the
downtown area to the New York State Thruway (Interchange 23) and to I-90. Access to the study area
from northbound I-787 is available from the Broadway Exit via Quay Street. Access to the study area
from southbound I-787 is available at Madison Avenue. Southbound access is also available via the
Colonie Street exit to the Water Street frontage road, which intersects with Broadway near the
Convention Center site.


Empire State Plaza (ESP) Arterial is a limited-access highway that connects I-787 and the Empire State
Plaza. The ESP Arterial also provides connection to communities of Rensselaer and East Greenbush via
the Dunn Memorial Bridge (US Routes 9 & 20). The Empire State Plaza Arterial is a divided highway

with two travel lanes in each direction. The posted speed limit on this roadway is 55 mph. Within the
project study area, the ESP Arterial is an elevated highway, with ramp connections to South Pearl Street.


Broadway is a north-south principal urban arterial that extends from the Port of Albany to the north city
boundary with Menands. The section of Broadway between State Street and Water Street/Quay Street
Connector intersection has two lanes for each direction of traffic. On-street parking is also provided on
both sides of the street. The section of Broadway from Water Street to Madison Avenue is one-way
southbound and has three travel lanes. Parking is not permitted on either side of the street in this one-way
section.

Madison Avenue is US Route 20, which is an east-west principal urban arterial roadway that provides
access into the vicinity of the Empire State Plaza from I-787. Madison Avenue is a two-way roadway
with adjacent parking on both sides of the streets. Madison Avenue is a four-lane divided roadway
between Broadway and Pearl Street. West of Pearl Street, it is two-lane road with one travel lane in each
direction. On-street parking is permitted on both sides of the street.


Pearl Street is State Route 32 and is a north-south principal urban arterial roadway. Pearl Street is
fundamentally a two-lane roadway with one travel lane in each direction, and with on-street parking. At
the study intersections, parking is restricted which creates secondary turn-lanes which are formally
delineated with pavement striping.


State Street is State Route 5 and is an east-west principal urban arterial roadway that has two travel lanes
in each direction. State Street features a center striped median from Eagle Street to Broadway. At the
signalized intersections, the median is curbed and landscaped. On-street parking is provided on both
sides of the street, with angled parking in the section between Eagle Street and Pearl Street. Left-turns are
restricted on all the approaches of the intersection of State Street and Pearl Street.


Hudson Avenue is an east-west local street that connects Pearl Street and Broadway, and forms the
northern boundary of the project site. Within the study area, Hudson Avenue has one travel lane in each
direction. On-street parking is permitted along the north side of the street between Liberty Street and
Pearl Street. This street is a main access to the Green-Hudson parking garage that is operated by the
Albany Parking Authority (APA).


Green Street is a north-south local street that runs parallel to Broadway and Pearl Streets. Green Street is
a one-way street southbound from State Street to Hamilton Street, and has one travel lane and adjacent
on-street parking on both sides of the street. The section from Hamilton Street to Madison Avenue is
two-way. The two-way section of Green Street provides access and circulation from a CDTA bus staging
area and state employee parking that are located under the ESP arterial. Green Street also provides access
to the Greyhound Bus Terminal located at Hamilton Street and Liberty Street.

3.4     Parking

The public parking supply within Albany's downtown provides 9,366 off-street parking spaces and 1,948
on-street parking spaces. Most on-street parking spaces are metered, limiting parking to one hour or two
hours to encourage turnover of the most convenient downtown parking. There are a few 20-minute
meters at high turnover locations. Longer-term meters are located on streets fringing the downtown core.
The metered on-street parking spaces are managed using a "Cash-key" debit system as well as accepting
coin payments.


The Albany Parking Authority (APA) operates three multi-level parking garages in the downtown area:
the Green-Hudson Garage, the Columbia Street Garage, and the Quackenbush Square Garage. These
three facilities provide approximately 2,650 parking spaces. The Green-Hudson Garage, which has a
900-car capacity, is located along the north side of Hudson Avenue, immediately adjacent to the
Convention Center site. The other two APA-operated garages are located outside the project study area.
The approximate walking distance between the project site and these other two garages are:

        Columbia Street Garage:          2,250 feet
        Quackenbush Garage:              3,250 feet

The remaining public parking is provided in lots managed by private operators or other public agencies
(such as the visitors parking at the ESP operated by NYSOGS). Figure 3-3 shows the primary off-street
parking facilities within the vicinity of the Convention Center.


Albany Parking Authority data shows that there are also 12,371 off-street parking spaces in
private/restricted facilities. These facilities are available only to permitted employees or customers of a
business or institution.

An inventory of the existing public and private parking within the immediate area of the Convention
Center site was compiled from the Albany Parking Authority, the New York State Office of General
Services and from field reconnaissance. Based on this inventory, 720 on-street and off-street parking
spaces were identified within the general boundaries of the Convention Center site. The New York State
Office of General Services (NYSOGS) also maintains parking facilities for state employees beneath the
elevated section of the ESP Arterial adjacent to the project site. There are 728 parking spaces in this area
bounded by Madison Avenue, Broadway, Pearl Street and Green Street.

Figure 3-3: Existing Off-Street Parking Facilities


The average monthly fees for public parking are $137.05 for Garage parking and $95.78 for surface lot
parking. The average daily fees are $11.75 for Garage parking and $7.00 for parking in surface lots
parking.


Subscription rates for monthly parking in the public lots are generally high, and in some cases, they
exceed the capacity of the facility, consistent with industry practice. However, because of normal
variations in use by subscription holders, spaces within the public lots are usually available for transient
daytime use during weekday business hours to meet current daily parking demand. According to the
Albany Parking Authority, there is available capacity for additional monthly subscriptions in the Green-
Hudson Garage (75 spaces) and the Quackenbush Garage (320 spaces).


The existing public parking supply has significant reserve capacity for current evening and weekend
parking demand.

3.5     Transit Service

Transit services within the project area include public transit operated by the Capital District
Transportation Authority (CDTA) and private intracity bus carriers such as Greyhound and Adirondack
Trailways. The project site is a central hub for both the inter-city and intra-city transit operations. The
Greyhound Bus Station is located at 34 Hamilton Street, within the boundaries of the project site. This
site is strategically located for the private carrier bus companies to provide convenient access to their
client base and for efficient access to interstate routes.



3.5.1   Public Transit

The Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) is the region's public transportation provider. The
CDTA operates approximately 60 bus routes throughout the region, which include local and express
services, and serves 150,000 passengers per week. More than half of these routes include service to the
study area, with approximately 750 buses travelling through the project site each weekday. Figure 3-4
below shows CDTA's route map for downtown Albany.


CDTA is currently progressing an initiative to implement a regional Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system.
The initial implementation of this high-performance transit service is focused on the NY Route 5 corridor
between downtown Schenectady and downtown Albany. The Albany Convention Center site is in the
vicinity of the planned Albany terminus of this BRT route.


                                                                 CDTA operates a bus staging area

3.5.2   Private Transit Carriers

                                   The primary private transit carriers serving downtown
                                   Albany are Greyhound and Adirondack Trailways.
                                   These carriers share the terminal facilities of the
                                   Greyhound Station at 34 Hamilton Street, along with
                                   other carriers, such as Bonanza and Peter Pan.


                                   Albany serves as a terminus stop for Greyhound routes
                                   as well as being an intermediate stop along other route
                                   destinations (e.g., New York City-to-Montreal or
                                   Buffalo-to-Boston).       Because     of    these   service
                                   characteristics, Greyhound provides on-site fueling and
                                   maintenance for their vehicles. Luggage handling and
                                   package service functions also affect their on-site
                                   operating requirements. Greyhound has approximately
                                   40 buses moving through the Albany terminal on an
                                   average weekday.


                                   Adirondack Trailways operates approximately 20 buses
                                   in and out of Albany on a daily basis. Albany is a route
                                   terminus for Adirondack Trailways; they do not have
                                   through operations to other destinations. Because of this
                                   characteristic, they are able to remotely-locate their fleet
                                   maintenance and bus storage facilities, which are located
                                   on Broadway south of the study site near the Port of
                                   Albany.     Figure 3-5 shows the location of the
                                   Greyhound bus station and maintenance facilities.

3.6     Pedestrians and Bicyclists


The project area is located within the urban downtown core
of the City. The pedestrian and bicycle accommodations are
typical of this urban setting. Sidewalks are provided on both
sides of all the streets within the study area, with marked
crosswalks    and      pedestrian   pushbuttons/indications    at
signalized intersections.


Bicyclists share the travel lanes with motor vehicles ­ there
are no designated bike lanes within the study area.
However, the New York State Department of Transportation
maintains    two       signed,   on-road   bicycle   routes   for
experienced cyclists within the study area: Bike Route 5 and
Bike Route 9. These designated bike touring routes are
shown on Figure 3-6.




The Convention Center site is near the Corning Preserve Bike-Hike trail along the Hudson River, which is
part of the 35-mile Mohawk-Hudson trail network. Access to this trail system is available from the Quay
Street underpass at Broadway. This trail is also shown on Figure 3-6.


                                                              CDTA also provides bike racks on their fleet
                                                              vehicles which promotes an integrated multi-
                                                              modal transportation system.   Bikeable Buses
                                                              are provided at regular intervals on all CDTA
                                                              routes.

4.0     PROJECTED TRAFFIC

The full buildout of the site is expected to be completed by 2010. The year 2014 is projected to be the
year of stabilization of event schedules and activities. The year 2014 consequently was selected to
represent the design horizon for evaluating the impact of the Convention Center. Traffic volumes for this
design year include traffic associated with general background changes in traffic flow due to area-wide
socio-economic factors, and the new site traffic generated by the Convention Center and Hotel.



4.1     Non-Site Background Traffic


In order to evaluate the traffic impacts of the Convention Center project in the context of background
conditions in the future year of stabilization, No-Build traffic volumes were estimated for the 2014
planning horizon. Based on a review of historical traffic volumes on the area roadways, and regional
travel demand information obtained from CDTC, an annual growth rate of 0.5% was applied to the
existing volumes to estimate the future No-Build traffic volumes in the study area. The 2014 No-Build
AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes are shown on Figure 4-1.



4.2     Site Traffic

To evaluate the future impacts of the proposed Convention Center and Hotel facilities on the
transportation system, an estimate of the trip generating potential of the site was calculated. This estimate
included considerations of the time of day when peak trips are likely to occur, mode distributions and
arrival/departure patterns. The estimated site traffic also considered the anticipated types and frequency
of events to be held at the proposed facility as identified in the market studies completed for the project.



4.2.1                Trip Generation


        4.2.1.1      Employees

The Convention Center and Hotel are estimated to have 350 full-time equivalent employees. A review of
US Census journey-to-work data for service-related occupations in the Capital Region shows that these
trips will typically occur at times outside of the conventional commuter peak hours of adjacent street

traffic or the peak hours of site activity. The census data also indicates that this employment group has a
high percentage of transit, walk/bike and ride-share trip modes, accounting for approximately 55% of
these work trips. Based on these factors, it is concluded that the trips generated by employees will not
have a significant impact on traffic operations and are consequently not considered for further analysis.



        4.2.1.2      Service/Support Delivery

Traffic generated by the project includes deliveries of supplies and equipment to support the
administrative and catering needs of the Convention Center and Hotel. These deliveries also typically
occur outside of normal peak hour periods and are randomly distributed throughout the day. These
deliveries will be consistent with the other vendor deliveries that occur throughout the downtown and will
not have a significant impact on traffic operations.


Convention Events will generate tractor-trailer truck trips associated with the set-up and take-down of the
exhibition. It is estimated that a full exhibition at the Convention Center will use 30 trucks for the set-up
and take-down of the event. The site concept includes provision for 9 loading docks to the exhibition
space, which would produce about 3-4 turnovers of trucks for the set-up and take-down processes. Based
on an estimated one-hour loading period, the set-up and take down for a capacity exhibition would each
take 4-5 hours to complete, and generate 15-20 truck trips during the hour of peak delivery (includes trips
entering and exiting). It is noted that this is not a daily activity, since it only occurs at the beginning and
end of each event. Smaller conferences and trade shows would generate fewer trucks. The times of day
that truck deliveries would occur will vary based on the scheduling of events. However, these truck flows
would not occur concurrently with the peak traffic generated by event attendees since they are associated
with pre-event and post-event activities.


For events that also utilize space at the Times Union Center, another 9 trucks is anticipated for set-up/take
down. This type of activity already normally occurs for events at the Times Union Center and the Times
Union Center has its own accommodation for truck staging and deliveries. While the Convention Center
will present an opportunity to increase the number of event days for the Times Union Center, the number
of trucks generated during peak hours will not be significantly different from what occurs currently at the
Times Union Center.

Albany Convention Center                                                                            Page 19
           4.2.1.3      Event Patrons

The market studies for the Convention Center identified that the design condition would have an average
daily attendance of 2,200 people for a convention-style event, where all attendees would essentially stay
for the duration of the event. It is estimated that 90% of the annual tradeshow and convention demand
would be at or below this design attendance. These events would typically occur on weekdays during
normal business hours and would consequently have the greatest potential for impact to peak-hour traffic
operations. Other events at the Convention Center, such as a consumer show, would have greater
potential daily attendance. For these events, people would arrive and depart randomly throughout the
event so that the hourly travel demand would not be as significant as for a conference event. These
consumer shows also typically occur during weekend or evening periods when background traffic levels
are low.


Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) is an industry-standard
resource for estimating the traffic generated by various types of land uses. However, trip data is not
available in this reference document for conference/convention facilities. Consequently, assumptions
pertaining to factors such as attendance characteristics, conference operations, modal distributions and
vehicle occupancies were used to develop the estimated trips generated during the weekday AM and PM
peak hours of adjacent street traffic for convention events.


Modal distribution of the event site traffic can vary significantly by the type of event and the geographic
extent of the participants/attendees. The accessibility of the project site by local transit services with
linkages to the Albany International Airport and CDTA-Rensselaer rail station, along with the downtown
urban context of the site, indicates a strong potential for access to the site by transit, taxi or by walking
(from area hotels). For the purposes of this analysis, it is estimated that 25% of the convention attendees
would use transit or walk to the site. This represents 550 convention attendees using non-auto modes for
the design event.


Documents published by the Eno Foundation1 and ITE2 cite vehicle occupancy rates for special events,
including events at conference centers, to be between 2.1 and 4.0 people per vehicle. However, this data
includes spectator events that would have higher vehicle occupancy than would be anticipated for a
convention event in Albany. Considering these vehicle occupancy characteristics and the range of

functions anticipated for the facility, an average vehicle occupancy of 1.5 people per vehicle was used to
estimate the trips associated with convention events.


Based on these factors of mode choice and vehicle occupancy, it is estimated that the design convention
event will generate approximately 1,100 vehicle trips. These trips were correlated to hourly distribution
factors for the weekday AM and PM periods to identify the amount of traffic generated by the design
convention event during the highest hour.       Based on these considerations, it is estimated that the
Convention Center will generate 550 vehicle trips during the weekday AM peak hour and 735 vehicle
trips during the weekday PM peak hour for the design convention event. Table 4-1 provides a summary
of the estimated entering and exiting distribution of site traffic during these peak hours. The supporting
calculations of these trip estimates are provided in the Appendix.

It is noted that the Phase Two expansion of the Convention Center will allow for larger events to be held
at the site than in Phase One. However, these larger events would not represent a design condition due to
their infrequent occurrence in terms of the number of annual event days. Further, these larger events are
likely to involve the use of lodging and/or parking resources that are located outside of the downtown
district, such that shuttle transportation and other special event management strategies would be deployed.
Therefore, the design attendance event of 2,200 people applies to both the Phase One and Phase Two
conditions.

4.2.2   Trip Distribution

The trip distribution patterns for the traffic generated by Convention Center events were estimated from
existing peak hour traffic patterns in the vicinity of the site and considering the proximity of the site to the
regional transportation network and modal facilities (airport, bus and rail). Based on these considerations,
it is estimated that the Convention Center traffic will have the following distribution:

             35%     to/from I-787 north
             30%     to/from I-787 south
             10%     to/from US Rte 20 east
              5%     to/from US Route 20 west
              5%     to/from Route 32 north
              5%     to/from Route 32 south
             10%     to/from NY Route 5 west



Trip assignments to the study area roadways also considered the changes in the street network associated
with the proposed Convention Center site. These trip assignments are shown on Figure 4-2 for the
weekday AM and PM peak hours.



4.3     Build Condition Traffic Volumes

The Convention Center Build Condition will cause a redistribution of non-site traffic in the study area due
to the displacement of the existing on-site parking supply and from changes to the street network from the
site development. The anticipated changes in non-site traffic flow for the 2014 design horizon are shown
on Figure 4-3.


The 2014 No-Build volumes were adjusted to reflect these changes in non-site traffic flow and then
combined with the Convention Center site trips to produce the 2014 Build Condition volumes for the AM
and PM peak hours. These Build Condition volumes are presented on Figure 4-4.

                 5.1              Site Access

                 The specific details of site planning and design have not been completed at this stage of the planning
                 process for the project. However, the project site will continue to have access to Hudson Avenue and to
                 Madison Avenue via Green Street. For the purposes of evaluating the traffic impacts of the project, it is
                 assumed that full access to the project will be available to site traffic from both of these streets. Truck
                 deliveries to the site will be provided from Madison Avenue at Green Street to access the Convention
                 Center and Hotel loading and service facilities.




                 5.2              Site Parking Demand

                 Activities and events at the Albany Convention Center will generate a range of parking demand that will
                 vary based on the specific events and the geographic area from which participants are drawn. It is
                 anticipated that locally-based events will generate a higher parking demand ratio per attendee than larger
                 regional or national events, since these larger events would have a higher proportion of participants
                 arriving by rail, bus or air, with transit or taxi service to the site.

Center at this level will accommodate the projected attendance representing a midweek design event of
2,200 people.


Parking for the hotel facilities is proposed to be provided at a ratio of 1-space per room, resulting in 400
parking spaces for this use. It is noted that the estimates of the convention center parking needs includes
assumptions regarding the interaction of the hotel and the convention center.


Based on these analyses, 1,100 total parking spaces are proposed to be provided on-site to accommodate
the projected parking demand of the Convention Center and Hotel facilities. Parking accommodations for
special events with higher parking demand are proposed to be accommodated through use of other
downtown parking supplies, as available (i.e., in the case of events occurring on weekends where there is
abundant parking supply in the downtown) or through the use of remote parking with shuttle service. The
Port of Albany has facilities available to accommodate special event parking which have been used for
special events at other downtown venues, such as the Times Union Center.




5.3     Capacity and Level of Service

The operating conditions of transportation facilities are evaluated based on the relationship of existing or
projected traffic volumes to the theoretical capacity of the highway facility. Various factors affect
capacity including traffic volume, travel speed, roadway geometry, grade, number and width of travel
lanes and intersection control. The current standards for evaluating capacity and operating conditions are
contained in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, published by the Transportation Research Board. The
procedures describe operating conditions in terms of Level of Service (LOS). In general, "A" represents
the best operating condition and "F" represents the worst. Level of service "D" or better typically
represents acceptable operating conditions.      Descriptions of LOS and the associated performance
measures set forth in the HCM 2000 are provided in Appendix B.


To determine the impact of the proposed project on the operations of the adjacent transportation system,
traffic operations were analyzed for the AM and PM peak hours for the following conditions:

roadway geometry, signal timings and intersection control for the weekday AM and PM peak hours. As
indicated in Tables 5-1 and 5-2, the roadway system provides generally high levels of service throughout
the study area, with overall intersection Levels of Service (LOS) that are LOS C or better during both
peak hours in most cases.         The notable exceptions to this level of mobility are at the following
intersections:


                    ·      Broadway, Madison Avenue and I-787 Southbound Ramps
                    ·      Madison Avenue and Green Street
                    ·      Broadway and Division Street

Broadway, Madison Avenue & I-787 SB Ramp Intersection:            This intersection is a connection of the
local street system to the regional interstate highway network, and is one of the focal points of traffic
entering and exiting the downtown area. Peak hour operations here are symptomatic of this gateway
characteristic and are consistent with the operations of other gateway connections in the City between the
local and regional roadways during peak hours. Although the operations analyses show that the overall
intersection operates at overall LOS B during the AM peak hour, vehicle queues on the I-787 ramp
approach to the intersection can be highly variable and sometimes extend beyond the existing available
storage. This condition does not occur over extended periods of time and does not seriously affect the
mobility of traffic moving through the area. The LOS E condition on the low-volume northbound
approach of Broadway in the AM peak hour is a result of the allocation of signal time to give priority to
the major traffic movements, and is not indicative of significant congestion on this approach.


The overall operation during the PM peak hour is LOS D, which is within an acceptable design service
threshold for urban conditions.

Madison Avenue & Green Street Intersection: The intersection of Madison Avenue and Green Street
operates at an acceptable overall LOS D during the PM peak hour, but the southbound approach of Green
Street operates at LOS F. This condition is associated with the delay for traffic on southbound Green

Albany Convention Center                                                                         Page 28
Street exiting the parking facilities in this area.     The traffic signal operates in a two-phase cycle,
alternating between Madison Avenue traffic and Green Street traffic. This contributes to delay for the
high volume of left-turn traffic from Green Street onto Madison Avenue headed toward the ramps to I-
787. The other intersection approaches all operate at LOS A or LOS B. The LOS F for the southbound
approach could be improved by providing an extended green period for southbound traffic with a
protected left-turn phase. The operations with this improvement would be LOS C for the southbound
approach, and the overall intersection would operate at LOS B.


Broadway & Division Street Intersection: The "T" intersection of Division Street and Broadway is
unsignalized, with a STOP sign on the Division Street approach. The analysis shows that Level of
Service F conditions are experienced for traffic on the Division Street approach during the PM peak hour.
However, the traffic volume on this approach is relatively low, and a review of other performance
measures such as the ratio of volume-to-capacity and the length of queues indicate that this intersection
operates within acceptable ranges. As noted at the other intersections in the study area, the period of
congested operations typically occurs for one hour or less such that the delay and congestion is not
excessive and does not significantly affect mobility.



5.3.2   2014 No-Build Operations


The projected general changes in traffic flow in the 2014 design year that are not associated with the
Convention Center will not have a significant impact on traffic operations in the study area. The overall
levels of service will continue to be consistent with the existing operations as described above. As shown
in Tables 5-1 and 5-2, it is noted that the LOS for two locations will change as result of the projected
background growth:


        Pearl Street & State Street: southbound approach changes from LOS D to LOS E in AM peak
        hour
        Broadway & Madison Avenue: northbound approach changes from LOS C to LOS E in PM peak
        hour

The change in LOS for the southbound approach of Pearl Street at State Street is primarily associated
with the signal timing priority given to the coordinated traffic flow on State Street, which operates at LOS
A/B. The overall intersection will continue to operate at LOS C. Minor adjustments to the signal timing
plans could be implemented as part of the City's routine and ongoing signal system management, as
appropriate to adjust for these minor changes in traffic flows and operations.

The change in LOS for the northbound approach of Broadway at Madison Avenue is again the result of
signal timing priorities at the intersection, as discussed previously regarding existing system operations.
The overall intersection operations will be LOS D, similar to existing operations, and no improvements
are indicated.


The operations for the 2014 No-Build condition are summarized in Tables 5-1 and 5-2 for the AM peak
hour and PM peak hour, respectively.




5.3.3   2014 Build Operations


The analyses of 2014 design year operations with the Convention Center traffic and changes in traffic
patterns associated with the site shows that the traffic operations at the study intersections will be
consistent with the operations of the No-Build operations. Locations where changes in the intersection
level of service will occur are noted in Table 5-3.

         Green Street & Madison Avenue         PM Peak Hour        change from LOS D to LOS E

         * Stop sign minor approach of unsignalized intersection




As noted in Table 5-3, most of the changes in level of service resulting from the Convention Center
project are not significant, and the overall levels of service will be within ranges that are consistent with
design objectives for urban areas. The change in level of service at the intersection of Division Street and
Broadway pertains to the stop-sign controlled minor approach movements. This operation is consistent

Albany Convention Center                                                                           Page 30
with other unsignalized intersections in the downtown core during peak hours and pertains to a relatively
low volume approach (less than 60 vehicles per hour). A review of other performance measures such as
the volume-to-capacity ratio and queues indicate that the intersection will operate acceptably and that no
improvements are indicated.


The change in level of service at the intersection of Green Street and Madison Avenue is associated with
the same issue described for the existing condition on the southbound approach of Green Street. With the
recommended improvement to provide an extension of greentime for this approach (for traffic exiting
from the Bus Station and Convention Center), this intersection will operate at the same level of service as
in the No-Build Condition; the southbound approach will operate at LOS C and the overall intersection
will operate at LOS B.


These analyses indicate that the transportation system will continue to provide acceptable levels of service
and mobility through the study area. Minor adjustments to signal timing plans could also be implemented
as part of the City's routine and ongoing signal system management, to optimize the traffic flow as
appropriate to adjust for future changes in traffic flow patterns.

6.0     IMPACTS AND MITIGATION

This section summarizes the evaluations of the impacts of the Convention Center project on the various
components of the study area transportation system, including traffic circulation, traffic operations,
parking, transit, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. This section also briefly describes the alternatives
considered to address the project's impacts and identifies recommended improvements.



6.1     Traffic Circulation

The Phase One development of the Convention Center will remove sections of the existing street grid
within the study site, including all or part of Dallius Street, Green Street, Hamilton Street and Division
Street. These are local streets that provide access/circulation to the existing surface parking facilities in
the area and do not have a network-level significance for traffic movement through the downtown.
However, elements of this street grid are currently used as part of the service route for CDTA transit and
by private-carrier buses. The impacts of the changes to the street grid on these transit operations are
described in more detail in subsection 6.4 ­ Transit.


Access to the parking facilities of the Key Bank Building at 66 South Peal Street (corner of Hudson
Avenue and South Pearl Street) may be impacted by the specifics of the site design for the ACC and will
need to be addressed as site design is progressed. Similarly, the service access for truck deliveries to this
building will also be impacted and will need to be addressed in the site design.


The changes in the street network and site design will also affect access to the existing parking area under
the ESP arterial between Green Street and Pearl Street, if this area continues to maintain its current use
for state employee parking. However, there is a potential that this space will be incorporated into the
Convention Center project for ancillary uses such as truck staging and site parking. In either case, the
access and circulation to this area will be integrated with the site design.


The street network provides for emergency access and evacuation from Hudson Avenue and via Green
Street to Madison Avenue. Emergency access is also available to Broadway from Division Street. It is
recommended that the site plan design include connectivity suitable for emergency vehicles to access the

Albany Convention Center                                                                              Page 34
Green Street area of the site via the Division Street-to-Hamilton Street corridor to provide system
redundancy for emergency access.



6.2     Traffic Operations

As discussed in Section 5, the development of the Convention center will cause a redistribution of
existing traffic because of the changes in the street grid associate with the Convention Center facilities.
The analysis of traffic operations with these changes and with the additional traffic generated by the
Convention Center shows that the project will not have a significant impact on traffic operations. Levels
of service at the study intersections will continue to be within thresholds that are consistent with the
mobility objectives for this urban area, with normal ongoing system management to optimize traffic
signal timings.


Signal improvements are recommended at the intersection of Green Street and Madison Avenue to be
able to extend the greentime provided to southbound traffic on Green Street. This will involve equipment
modification/replacement to provide the signal displays and vehicle detection to implement this
improvement. This improvement would address existing congestion during the PM peak hour and is also
recommended to facilitate egress from the Convention Center parking during peak periods.




6.3     Parking

The Convention Center and Hotel project will generate a design parking demand for 1,100 parking
spaces. The Phase One development of the Albany Convention Center will also permanently displace
720 parking spaces, including 71 on-street metered spaces and 649 off-street spaces. These spaces
include general transient and monthly permit users. The Greyhound Bus Company also maintains a lot
for bus parking and employee parking in the area to be occupied by the Convention Center. This lot
typically stores 10-15 buses and parking for approximately 25 employees.


The area adjacent to the Convention Center site, beneath the elevated section of the ESP arterial, provides
730 parking spaces for state employees. The NYS Office of General Services (NYSOGS) manages these
parking spaces through an agreement with the NYS Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), and

Albany Convention Center                                                                          Page 35
provides a shuttle service to the Empire State Plaza for employees using this parking. It is intended that
this parking be relocated to other proposed facilities, which would enable this space under the ESP
arterial to be used for enhanced transit staging/parking, relocated Greyhound parking and for various
Convention Center-related uses such as charter bus parking, and truck/equipment staging.

This plan will result in the permanent displacement of 1,450 parking spaces. Combined with the new
parking demand generated by the Convention Center and Hotel, results in a total parking need of 2,550
parking spaces.


Various options and alternatives were explored to address the parking demand, including opportunities for
transit/ride-share incentives to reduce parking demand and for new parking structures.               Although
strategies to promote increased transit ridership and other modes are an important element of the regional
congestion management plan, it was found that the mechanisms and local issues to accomplish this are
beyond the scope and control of the Convention Center action. It is noted that the parking demand
assessment for the Convention Center accounted for the anticipated mode share of transit riders, walkers,
etc, recognizing its urban location and strategic accessibility to transit and other transportation modes and
services. The feasible options that were identified to meet the site parking demand and the displaced
parking impacts of the project include the following:

        ·   New on-site parking facilities for Convention Center and Hotel
        ·   Construct new surface parking lots along Church Street under the elevated portion of I-787,
            south of the site
        ·   Leverage available subscription capacity at APA Green-Hudson and Quackenbush garages
        ·   Construct an additional parking level on the existing Green-Hudson garage
        ·   Retain a portion of the existing parking beneath the ESP arterial


Together, these options would create approximately 2,555 parking spaces, which would accommodate the
displaced parking and the new Convention Center/Hotel parking demand. This parking mitigation plan is
summarized in Table 6-1.


The elements of the parking mitigation plan to provide parking through leverage of the reserve capacity of
the APA Quackenbush Garage and to provide surface parking along Church Street would require
incentives to counteract the distance of these facilities to the activity centers served by the parking that is
currently located on the Convention Center site.

The APA Quackenbush Garage is located near the intersection of Broadway and Clinton Avenue,
approximately ¾ mile north of the project site. This garage is about a 15-20 minute walk to the project
site and to employment destinations along the State Street corridor. This distance is too far from the
Convention Center to be accessible and would be a competitive disadvantage for attracting events. This
distance is also further than is normally accepted by commuters for outdoor/uncovered walking distances
between parking and employment. However, the Quackenbush Garage is served by seven CDTA transit
routes that also serve the State Street corridor. If incentivized to compensate for the added trip cost and
transfer time, this transit service could enhance the serviceability of the Quackenbush Garage for workers
to access the State Street corridor whose parking is displaced at the Convention Center site.


The proposed Church Street/I-787 parking is also remote to the Convention Center site, making it
infeasible for general Convention Center use. This site is proposed to be used to relocate the state
employee parking displaced from the OGS lots under the ESP arterial. Shuttle services that are currently
provided to transport employees to the Empire State Plaza can be easily re-routed to service these new
lots. The location of the Church Street/I-787 lots also has convenient access to I-787 and the same street
network as available at the existing OGS lots. The estimated capacity of the Church Street/I-787 facility
is 180 spaces less than would be OGS parking displaced at the Convention Center. These lost spaces will
be recovered in the plan to accommodate the other displaced parking spaces.

6.4     Transit

Phase One of the Convention Center will have a significant impact on existing CDTA public transit
circulation and operations as a result of the changes to the street network necessitated by the Convention
Center building footprint. The primary impacts to CDTA's system are: [1] access and function of the
existing CDTA bus staging area, and [2] route circulation and service to Broadway northbound.



6.4.1   CDTA Bus Staging


As noted in previous sections, CDTA maintains a central staging area for their buses in a lot located
underneath the elevated section of Empire State Plaza arterial, adjacent to the Convention Center site.
The buses enter this lot from Madison Avenue west of Green Street and exit to Green Street west of
Dallius Street. The exit from the existing staging area will directly conflict with the truck service
facilities for the Convention Center.     This conflict will contribute to significant problems for bus
maneuvers leaving the staging area, which will also affect service times and present scheduling issues for
CDTA. Investigations of options to address this impact considered alternatives to relocate the staging
area to other locations within the site area and other off-site locations. From these investigations, and in
consultation with CDTA, NYSOGS and NYSDOT staff, a preferred alternative was identified to move
the bus staging to a new area under the ESP arterial east of Green Street. The relocated bus staging area
is also proposed to be expanded to accommodate the displaced Greyhound bus parking and to provide a
parking/staging area for charter buses serving events at the Convention Center. Access to this staging
area is recommended to be provided from Madison Avenue approximately 250-feet west of Broadway.
Egress will be provided to Liberty Street. The relocated staging area is shown on Figure 6-1.

Albany Convention Center                                                                          Page 38
Figure 6-1: Relocated Bus Staging Area

6.4.2   CDTA Route Circulation


Access to Broadway northbound is a critically important function of CDTA's route structure and rider
base. The section of Broadway near the Convention Center will also be a terminal station in their planned
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service along the NYS Route 5 corridor. Currently, CDTA buses use Dallius
Street and Hudson Avenue to move between their staging area under the ESP arterial and Broadway.
CDTA also has a bus stop at the Greyhound Station at the corner of Dallius Street and Hamilton Street,
along this route.


The street network that will remain after the Convention Center is built will not be suitable for bus
circulation to access Broadway because of the narrow street widths and small corner radii. Improvements
to adapt Hamilton Street, Liberty Street and Division Street to accommodate these bus movements are not
feasible due to constraints of the Convention Center footprint and surrounding buildings. CDTA staff
also expressed their concern that bus movement through the Convention Center site could negatively

Albany Convention Center                                                                        Page 39
affect their route service and travel times as a result of the increased traffic flow in the area, such that the
preferred option to address these impact issues relates to finding an alternative route for bus circulation.


The local street network in the study area is somewhat constrained by the configuration of the elevated
ESP arterial and I-787 highways and their related ramp systems. One result of this configuration is that
the section of Broadway between Water Street and Madison Avenue is designated for one-way traffic
southbound. For buses to access Broadway northbound from the study area without traveling through the
Convention Center site involves a southbound route to Quay Street and then northbound to the Broadway-
Quay Street connector at Water Street. This route is shown on Figure 6-2.




Figure 6-2: Alternate CDTA Bus Route




Traffic Impact Study                                                          Clough Harbour & Associates LLP
Albany Convention Center                                                                             Page 40
However, CDTA has calculated that this route will increase their transit operating costs by more than
$600,000 per year as a result of the additional "wheel costs" associated with this route diversion. These
"wheel costs" account for factors such as operator time, fuel costs and vehicle maintenance applied to
each trip on an annualized basis.


Another option that was considered was to convert the one-way section of Broadway to general two-way
operation to allow buses to access Broadway northbound from Madison Avenue.                 However, this
alternative was found to have a significant negative effect on traffic operations at the intersection of
Broadway, Madison Avenue and I-787 Southbound Ramps, which would contribute to increased delay
and queues on the I-787 ramp. Because of these negative operations and safety impacts, this option was
also dismissed from further consideration.


A series of additional investigations were conducted of the potential to create a new street connection
from the site to the two-way section of Broadway north of Water Street that could serve the CDTA
circulation. However, these alternatives all proved unfeasible because of impacts to existing buildings,
inadequate right-of-way and/or they were not consistent with access management best practices (which
would have a negative impact on mobility and safety on Broadway). These options were consequently
also dismissed from further consideration.


The preferred alternative that evolved from these investigations is to create a bus-only access to
Broadway from an extension of Liberty Street along the north side of the EPS arterial, and create a
contra-flow bus lane on Broadway to allow northbound bus-only movement between this access and the
Broadway-Water Street intersection. The section of Broadway between the Liberty Street extension and
Madison Avenue would remain one-way southbound so that there would not be a change in operations at
the intersection of Broadway, Madison Avenue and the I-787 Southbound ramps. This contra-flow lane
concept is illustrated on Figure 6-3.


The Liberty Street extension is proposed to be gate-controlled with secure activation by authorized
vehicles to provide access to the contra-flow lane. CDTA buses could also turn south on Broadway with
general southbound traffic as necessary. This concept will allow CDTA to efficiently maintain their route
access to Broadway and will not incur additional wheel costs from their current levels. This alternative

Figure 6-3: Contra-flow Bus Lane Concept


can be constructed primarily within NYSDOT right-of-way, but may also require some property
acquisition from the adjacent Holiday Inn Express.


The implementation of this access connection to Broadway will require a break-in-access authorization
from NYSDOT and from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) because of the terms of right-of-
way acquisition when the interstate facilities were constructed. While this is not simply a procedural

issue, it is anticipated that the governing authorities will support a request for break-in-access since the
break-in-access will provide a public benefit by promoting public transit operations and supporting the
overall public benefits of the Convention Center project.


The implementation of the contra-flow bus lane will require reconstruction of the section of Broadway to
provide a separating median between the southbound traffic and the northbound bus-only lane. This
median will also provide a barrier at the intersection of Pruyn Street and Broadway to maintain the
existing right-in/right-out only from Pruyn Street.     Intersection improvements at the intersection of
Broadway, Water Street and the Broadway-Quay Street connector are also recommended to modify the
geometry and signal equipment to accommodate the contra-flow bus lane, as shown in Figure 6-3.




6.4.3   Private Carriers


The Phase One construction of the Convention Center has been designed to minimize the impact to the
existing operations of the Greyhound/Trailways facilities and services. The convention center building
footprint does not encroach on the site of the existing bus station or the streets directly abutting it.
However, the project will impact the circulation route to/from Broadway via Division Street used by
many of the buses arriving from or destined to I-787 northbound.            As was noted in the previous
discussion of CDTA bus circulation (See Section 6.4.2), improvements to accommodate future bus
movements to and from Division Street from the bus station are not feasible due to constraints of the
Convention Center footprint and surrounding buildings. Alternate routes are available to these private
carriers, such as those shown on Figure 6-4. The additional distances associated with these alternative
access routes are not significant in the context of the overall route distance of these carriers and does not
have a significant impact on their "wheel costs".




Traffic Impact Study                                                       Clough Harbour & Associates LLP
Albany Convention Center                                                                          Page 43
Figure 6-4: Alternative Private Carrier Route


Improvements around the Greyhound Station will be needed to meet the access and circulation
requirements of the Greyhound bus service operations as a result of the changes in the street network
associated with the Convention Center. These improvements are to widen Hamilton Street between
Dallius Street and Liberty Street, and to increase the corner radius at Hamilton Street and Liberty Street to
accommodate a right-turn maneuver for a bus to enable package loading along the east side of the station.


The project's impact to the existing Greyhound bus and employee parking is planned to be
accommodated in the provisions made to provide transit staging under the ESP arterial, as described in
Section 6.4.1.

6.4.4   Intermodal Transportation Center


The site of the existing Greyhound station has been identified for possible future conversion into an
intermodal transportation center to better serve transit providers and users. Concepts for an intermodal
center at this site have been discussed for nearly thirty years. The future Phase Two expansion of the
Convention Center presents an opportunity for a collaborative effort to progress the intermodal concept
and to coordinate this with the expanded Convention Center facilities. At this time, the program and
space requirements for the intermodal facility have not been defined. These details and the similar space
configurations for Phase Two of the Convention Center will need to be evaluated in the future as these
plans advance. However, the Phase One actions to consolidate transit staging facilities under the ESP
arterial and provide access improvements to Broadway contribute positively to the process of organizing
and integrating the various transit operations which will further advance the goal of developing an
intermodal center.




6.4.5   Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities


The site redevelopment for the Convention Center will have a positive impact on the pedestrian
environment by transforming the area from an open parking field to a vibrant urban activity center. The
project also includes streetscape improvements to strengthen the pedestrian connectivity of the site to the
Pearl Street and Broadway corridors. The recommended transit route diversions enable the Division
Street area to be redesigned to create a pedestrian-oriented corridor between the Convention Center and
Broadway.


The intersection improvements recommended for the intersection of Broadway and Water Street to
remove the free-flow southbound lane on Broadway will place all vehicle movements under signal
control, which will reduce the pedestrian-vehicle conflict areas at the intersection for access to the
Corning Preserve and Hudson River waterfront area. This improvement also provides a corner space for
landscape treatments at this gateway area of the downtown.


The reconstruction of the section of Broadway south of Water Street for the contra-flow bus lane will
potentially require the removal of some or all of the sidewalk along the east side of Broadway (adjacent to
I-787). The full extent of this impact will be determined as the design effort is progressed. This is not
anticipated to have a significant impact on pedestrian accessibility or circulation as this sidewalk does not

Traffic Impact Study                                                       Clough Harbour & Associates LLP
Albany Convention Center                                                                          Page 45
connect to anything and a continuous sidewalk is available on the west side of Broadway extending from
Madison Avenue to the downtown.


The project will not affect the existing bicycle facilities in the area and the changes in vehicle traffic will
not have an impact on the operations or function of the designated bicycle touring routes. Bicycle
facilities and amenities at the Convention Center are recommended to promote multimodal travel to the
Convention Center in conjunction with CDTA's existing Bikeable Bus program and the nearby linkage to
the Hudson-Mohawk trail system.



6.5     Special Events

The Convention Center is anticipated to periodically attract larger events than the "design" event. These
special events may require the deployment of additional short-duration transportation and parking
management strategies to accommodate the traffic generated by these events. Some examples of the
strategies that may be deployed for these special events include:


            Traveler Information
               Variable message signs
               Media announcements/communication
               Pre-event information campaigns

            Travel Demand Management
               Remote parking with transit shuttle
               Enhanced airport and train station shuttle
               Parking priorities for car-pools, etc.
               Parking pricing management
               Automobile-restricted zones
               Transit incentives
               Rideshare incentives

            Traffic Management
               Traffic responsive signal operations
               Manual intersection control
               Temporary signing and traffic control
               Temporary on-street parking restrictions
               Traffic management/enforcement patrols



The need for and development of a management plan for these special events should be determined on a
case-by-case basis due to the variability of the possible event characteristics.           The planning and
implementation of these strategies for special events will involve interagency and interjurisdiction

Traffic Impact Study                                                         Clough Harbour & Associates LLP

coordination.         The Capital Region Traffic Management Task Force is an existing consortium of
transportation agencies and other stakeholders that coordinate the transportation management planning
and implementation for special events in the region, including those in downtown Albany. This task
force provides the organizational framework for developing logical and consistent event management
plans, in conjunction with the event planners, to provide safe and efficient transportation operations
during these special events.



7.0        OPTIMIZED GROWTH PLAN

The Convention Center is anticipated to stimulate additional development in the study area and adjacent
sectors of the City. Assessments of the opportunities for induced growth considered a Secondary Master
Plan area that is generally within a ¾ mile radius of the Convention Center site and is bounded by the
Hudson River Waterfront, Morton Avenue, Delaware Avenue/Lark Street and Livingston Avenue.
Development associated with the Optimized Growth Plan for the secondary master plan area would create
1.76 million square feet of new commercial retail and office space and 5,600 residential units.


The potential traffic generated by this induced development was estimated using trip generation data
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers as a basis. Table 7-1 below summarizes this trip
generation potential of the optimized growth development. As shown in Table 7-1, this new development
could generate 6,500 vehicle trips during the AM peak hour and 9,000 vehicle trips during the PM peak
hour. It is noted that this trip estimate is based on a primarily suburban, auto-oriented land use pattern,
which is not characteristic of the Master Plan area. However, these figures are useful in illustrating the
magnitude of potential impact and the importance of implementing strategies to integrate this future
development into the urban context through smart-growth urban design principles to reinforce and
strengthen multi-modal transportation opportunities.

Albany Convention Center                                                                                                      Page 47
As an example, Albany's Center Square neighborhood features mixed land uses in densities that make
walking, bicycling and transit feasible and attractive alternatives to driving. US Census data indicates
that less than half (45 percent) of the journey-to-work trips originating in the Center Square neighborhood
are made by automobile; with walking, biking and transit accounting for 50 percent of these trips and
work-at-home comprising another 5 percent. In contrast, more than 70 percent of the work-based trips for
residents of the City as a whole are currently made by automobile.


The revitalization of the Secondary Master Plan area through the Optimized Growth Plan presents an
opportunity to address the transportation needs and impacts of this development through land use policies
and system design that achieve an efficient, sustainable and environmentally sensitive multi-modal
transportation system. Land use regulations and incentives to encourage increased development density,
mixed-use, and pedestrian-supportive design will increase the options available for the movement of
people and goods and thereby lessen the reliance on automobiles. Transit-oriented development that
combines these land use principles to establish activity centers that are integrated with, or located within
convenient walking distance of, existing and planned transit services (such as CDTA's Bus Rapid Transit
system) will also make regional investments in transit more effective and further contribute to reduced
vehicle trips and vehicle-miles of travel (VMT).


The quality and character of the street layout and design also contribute to the effectiveness of a multi-
modal transportation system. The existing grid configuration of the street network within the master plan
area provides the basic framework for efficient multimodal accessibility and circulation to accommodate
the development of the Optimized Growth Plan. Adopting policies to support a concept of "Complete
Streets" to provide safe, efficient and appealing environments for walking, biking and transit will also
help to create a sustainable transportation system and enhance the vitality of the community.


The primary objective of the "Complete Streets" concept is to design the physical space within the public
right-of-way to support the human and economic activities of the surrounding uses in a way that considers
the needs of all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit vehicles and users, and motorists, of all
ages and abilities. Elements of a "Complete Street" policy should aim to create a comprehensive,
connected network that is consistent with the context of the neighborhood and community. This policy
should also recognize that not all streets and contexts are the same, so that the solutions and design
elements can be flexible to balance user needs.       A "Complete Streets" policy should also include

Albany Convention Center                                                                          Page 48
performance standards with measurable outcomes that reflect the multi-modal components of the
transportation system and do not rely solely on the level-of-service metrics for vehicle traffic.


The integration of land use policies that support increased density and mixed-use with "Complete Streets"
policies that ensure that all users are appropriately accommodated by the transportation system can
achieve the following benefits:


        Reduced Congestion
        Improved Safety
        Improved Air Quality
        Improved Mobility and Accessibility
        Improved Health
        Facilitates Safe-Routes-to-School and other mobility programs oriented toward children

The land use and transportation design policies described above can also reduce the amount of parking
needed to support the new development within the Secondary Master Plan area. For example, increased
residential and employment density, and mixed-use development patterns, can reduce parking demand by
15-20 percent. Transit accessibility can also reduce parking requirements for housing and employment by
10-20 percent. Additional parking management strategies can further reduce the number of parking
spaces required to support the Optimum Growth Plan. Among the types of strategies that could be
employed are the following:


        Shared parking
        Establish parking maximums
        Flexible parking standards
        Unbundled Parking
        In-lieu parking fees



Shared Parking decreases the total number of parking spaces needed to support development by taking
advantage of the different peak parking demand characteristics of each land use component within a
mixed-use project. For example, offices and restaurants can often share the same pool of parking, which
reduces the overall number of spaces required to support these uses.


Parking Maximums place an upper limit on the supply of parking allowed at individual sites (as opposed
to requirements for minimum parking). This strategy is typically used in conjunction with an integrated
area-wide parking management program used to reduce excessive parking supply, which would otherwise
work against the objectives for a multi-modal transportation system.

Albany Convention Center                                                                           Page 49
Flexible parking standards allow for the parking needs of each development site to be considered in the
context of density, mixed-use, proximity to transit services and other remote parking.         With these
considerations, the on-site parking may be sized to be more frequently occupied fully, as long as overflow
parking is available nearby.


Unbundled parking is a strategy where the on-site parking is rented or sold separately from the building
space, so the occupants only pay for the amount of parking they want. In the case of offices, this could
also encourage employers to offer financial incentives (such as parking cash-out or transit benefits) to
employees for ride-sharing or transit alternatives to reduce parking need and vehicle trips.


In-Lieu parking fees are a mechanism where the City would collect fees from the site developers and
provide centrally located parking that is available to the development's tenants and visitors, rather than
having on-site parking. The fees would be established by the City and are generally based on the cost to
provide parking.


The implementation of parking management strategies for the Optimum Growth Plan should be
developed in coordination with the development community, Albany Parking Authority, City planners
and traffic engineers, and neighborhood groups.         The primary objective of these strategies is to
appropriately balance the parking required to service the new development and to achieve the broader
transportation goals to provide an efficient and safe multimodal system. Together, these principles of
smart-growth land development, "Complete Streets" design, and parking management will provide the
mechanisms for the City to achieve the Optimal Growth plan objectives and provide the transportation
system necessary to support this growth.




8.0     CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The preceding analyses and evaluations have been conducted to identify the transportation impacts
associated with the development of the Albany Convention Center in downtown Albany, New York. This
study examined these impacts to traffic circulation, traffic operations, parking, transit and
pedestrian/bicycle components of the transportation system.

Albany Convention Center                                                                          Page 50
The following improvements and strategies have been identified to mitigate the impacts of the
Convention Center project on these various system components and to address the site requirements for
parking and access.

Traffic Circulation:
   1. Maintain access to 66 South Pearl Street parking garage and service loading dock.

    2. Improve Division Street-to-Dallius Street corridor for emergency services and evacuation.

Traffic Operations:
   1. Madison Avenue and Green Street: modify the signal control equipment and signal displays to
        provide a phase extension with protected left-turn arrow for southbound traffic on Green Street.

Parking:
   1. Construct new parking facilities as follows:
             Convention Center: 1,000 spaces
             Convention Center Hotel: 400 spaces
             Church Street/I-787 Remote Lots: 550 spaces
             APA Green-Hudson Garage Expansion: add new level for 210 parking spaces

    2. Leverage additional monthly subscriptions for dislocated onsite parking at APA's Green-Hudson
       Garage and Quackenbush Garage - 475 spaces. This will require coordination with APA and
       CDTA to establish incentives to compensate for added distance to primary employment
       destinations in the study area.

    3. Relocate state employee parking from surface lots beneath ESP Arterial adjacent to site to new
       parking facilities noted above. Convert this area to Convention Center uses.

Transit:
   1. Relocate CDTA Bus staging area beneath the Empire State Plaza Arterial from its present
        location north of Madison Avenue and west of Green Street to an area north of Madison Avenue
        between Broadway and Green Street. Provide an entrance-only access from Madison Avenue
        approximately 250 feet west of Broadway and an exit onto Liberty Street.

    2. Expand the relocated staging area to incorporate accommodations for displaced Greyhound
       parking and for Charter buses serving the Convention Center.

    3. Liberty Street Extension: Construct a new one-way roadway to connect Liberty Street to
       Broadway. This connector road will be restricted for buses only and will provide one-way
       (eastbound) travel. A gated control is recommended at the west end of the connecter to limit
       access to authorized buses only. A traffic signal is anticipated, if warranted, at the intersection of
       this connector road and Broadway. This signal will need to be interconnected to the signal at the
       intersection of Broadway and Water Street to provide coordinated operation. An alternative
       control strategy would be to link vehicle detection on the connector road with the signal at
       Broadway and Water Street to serve as a surrogate preemption. This improvement requires a
       "break-in-access" authorization of the NYSDOT and the FHWA.

    4. Contra-flow Bus Lane on Broadway: This improvement is contingent on implementation of the
        Liberty Street extension improvement, and is intended to address the circulation and access

Traffic Impact Study                                                       Clough Harbour & Associates LLP
Albany Convention Center                                                                          Page 51
        impacts of the Convention Center project on CDTA transit services. This improvement will
        involve widening of Broadway to establish the contra-flow lane and to install a median barrier to
        separate this lane from southbound traffic.

    5. Reconstruction of Broadway-Water Street-Quay Street Connector intersection to accommodate
       the northbound contra-flow bus lane and to create a conventional 4-legged intersection. This
       includes reconstruction of the eastbound intersection approach (Broadway) and removal of the
       landscaped island at the south leg of the intersection. Modify the alignment of the Water Street
       approach to the intersection to accommodate the new contra-flow northbound lane on the south
       leg of Broadway, including pavement, curb, sidewalk and landscaping. Replace the traffic signal
       equipment at this intersection to reflect the new geometry and traffic control/phasing.

    6. Widen Hamilton Street between Dallius Street and Liberty Street to provide two-way traffic
       circulation and on-street parking on both sides. Estimated width of pavement widening is 8 feet.
       Modify the curb radius at the southwest quadrant to facilitate bus right-turns from Hamilton
       Street onto Liberty Street (southbound).


Special Events:
Special events at the Convention Center may require the deployment of additional short-duration
transportation and parking management strategies to accommodate the traffic generated by these events.
These strategies involve a combination of traveler information, travel demand management and/or traffic
management tools and techniques. The Capital Region Traffic Management Task Force is an existing
consortium of transportation agencies and other stakeholders that provides the organizational framework
for developing logical and consistent event management plans, in conjunction with the event planners, to
provide safe and efficient transportation operations during these special events.



Optimal Growth Plan

The Convention Center is anticipated to stimulate additional development within a Secondary Master
Plan area that is generally within a ¾ mile radius of the Convention Center site. Development associated
with the Optimized Growth Plan for this Secondary Master Plan area would create 1.76 million square
feet of new commercial retail and office space and 5,600 residential units.


This induced development has the potential to generate a significant amount of new traffic within the
area. The transportation impacts and needs of this development can be addressed by applying land use
policies and system design that achieve an efficient, sustainable and environmentally sensitive multi-
modal transportation system.     Land use regulations and incentives are recommended to encourage
increased development density, mixed-use, and pedestrian-supportive design to increase the options
available for the movement of people and goods and thereby lessen the reliance on automobiles. Transit-

Albany Convention Center                                                                             Page 52
oriented development that combines these land use principles to establish activity centers that are
integrated with, or located within convenient walking distance of, transit services will also make regional
investments in transit more effective and further contribute to reduced vehicle trips and vehicle-miles of
travel (VMT).


The quality and character of the street layout and design also contribute to the effectiveness of a multi-
modal transportation system. Adopting policies to support a concept of "Complete Streets" to provide
safe, efficient and appealing environments for walking, biking and transit will also help to create a
sustainable transportation system and enhance the vitality of the community.


These land use and transportation design policies can also reduce the amount of parking needed to support
the new development within the Secondary Master Plan area. Additional parking management strategies
can further reduce the number of parking spaces required to support the Optimum Growth Plan. Among
the types of strategies that could be employed are the following:


        Shared parking
        Establish parking maximums
        Flexible parking standards
        Unbundled Parking
        In-lieu parking fees



The implementation of parking management strategies for the Optimum Growth Plan should be
developed in coordination with the development community, Albany Parking Authority, City planners
and traffic engineers, and neighborhood groups.        The primary objective of these strategies is to
appropriately balance the parking required to service the new development and to achieve the broader
transportation goals to provide an efficient and safe multi-modal system. Together, these principles of
smart-growth land development, "Complete Streets" design, and parking management will provide the
mechanisms for the City to achieve the Optimal Growth plan objectives and provide the transportation
system necessary to support this growth.

             ACC will remove 1,450 spaces from area = 58% reduction of existing volumes


             Assumption: Parking accumulates over a 3-hour AM commuter period
                                Estimated Peak-hour trip rate per parking space = 0.50 trips


             2,485 x 0.50 =         1,240 trips generated by parking during peak hour
             1,750 - 1,240 =        510 trips thru traffic during peak hour
             1,240 trips x 0.58 =        719 trips reduced from area as a result of parking displacement


     Say:    720 entering trips will divert from area in AM Peak due to parking displacement
             720 exiting trips will divert from area in PM Peak due to parking displacement

                       LOS             Control Delay per Vehicle (s/veh)*
                        A                           10
                        B                           10-20
                        C                           20-35
                        D                           35-55
                        E                           55-80

               * s/veh = seconds per vehicle



LOS A describes operations with low control delay, up to 10 s/veh. This LOS occurs
when progression is extremely favorable and most vehicles arrive during the green
phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may tend to contribute to
low delay values.

LOS B describes operations with control delay greater than 10 and up to 20 s/veh. This
level generally occurs with good progression, short cycle lengths, or both. More vehicles
stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of delay.

LOS C describes operations with control delay greater than 20 and up to 35 s/veh.
These higher delays may result from only fair progression, longer cycle lengths, or both.
Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. Cycle failure occurs when a
green phase does not serve queued vehicles, and overflows occur. The number of
vehicles stopping is significant at this level, though many still pass through the
intersection without stopping.

LOS D describes operations with control delay greater than 35 and up to 55 s/veh. At
LOS D, the influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result
from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, or high volume-
to-capacity (v/c) ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping
declines. Individual cycle failures are noticeable.

LOS E describes operations with control delay greater than 55 and up to 80 s/veh.
These high delay values generally indicate poor progression, long cycle lengths, and
high v/c ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent.

LOS F describes operations with delay in excess of 80.0 s/veh. This level, considered
unacceptable to most drivers, often occurs with over-saturation, that is, when arrival flow
rates exceed the capacity of lane groups. It may also occur at high v/c ratios with many
individual cycle failures. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also be contribute
significantly to high delay levels. Often, vehicles do not pass through the intersection in
one signal cycle.
Unsignalized Intersections

The level of service criteria for an unsignalized intersection differs from that of a
signalized intersection because of the expectation that signalized intersections
encounter more traffic and therefore greater delays. The thresholds for the levels of
service of unsignalized intersections are as follows:

              LOS CRITERIA FOR UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
                      LOS              Control Delay per Vehicle (s/veh)
                       A                           10
                       B                           10-15
                       C                           15-25
                       D                           25-35
                       E                           35-50
